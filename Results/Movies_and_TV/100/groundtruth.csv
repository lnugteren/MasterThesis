I found myself annoyed by the slightly muffled and sometimes garbled soundtrack-which incidentally improved towards the middle (probably as Shane developed his prowess with audio and the actors begin to project a bit more). The graininess of the film shows through at times, but once again- it sets the mood and actually looks very intentional. Yet, that very tension actually sets you up for the true impact-when you realize the ""permutations are endless.""\n\n""Primer"" is one of those very rare movies that comes along to give Hollywood a real kick in the pants-to say ""THIS is how you create a thriller""-it's in the heart, not in the budget.

48;3.0;4.0;101.0;"Plot Summary Two friends and research entrepreneurs serendipitously develop a time travel machine.  Thankfully free from an overt attempt to try to articulate the technical solution to time travel, the movie deals with the progressive temptations the friends face as they plunge deeper into a dizzying map of future-past interdependencies. They make the expected exploitation of the stock market but their dabblings with the relationship between future and past and present begin to be concerned with friends and family.  As they do this, the movie becomes increasingly confusing due to the complexities of the causalities and changes they are working in the lives of other people.\n\nScript The script is pretty solid, especially considering the complexity of the story line.  The dialogue is natural, to the point where I wondered if most of it was improvised.\n\nActing and Character Development Surprisingly good.  The two primary characters play off each other well.  Their dialogue together is natural and real.  They have a best-friend chemistry together.\n\nCinematography and Editing The cinematography is remarkable for a low budget independent movie.  The color is great, the composition is creative and it helps tell the story.  It does this by creating uncertainty in the time frame during their iterations of time travel.  Toward the last third of the movie, the editing becomes very confusing: the protagonists are shuffling their time trips and this makes the storyline difficult to follow.  I say this is good because I think that was the intent.  They wanted to convey that there was complexity and uncertainty associated the implications of time travel.  The audience is confused because they are confused and uncertain.\n\nThe movie is compelling.  I kept thinking throughout the movie how remarkable it was that it was such a well made movie.  The acting, the concept, the script... it all comes together to create a compelling movie.  Yes, it is not clear and confusing.\n\nLook, let me tell you a story.\n\nAbout ten years ago, I was into John Steinbeck.  I read many of his novels: Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, To A God Unknown, Of Mice and Men, The Winter of Our Discontent, Tortilla Flat, Cannery Row, The Pearl, Acts of King Arthur.\n\nSo, have you ever read The Grapes of Wrath?  Man, it's not a pleasant read.  Ponderous is the world that comes to mind.  I finish the novel on Thanksgiving weekend.  I happen to be sick from food poisoning due to some lovely Wendy's food.  The incessant dry heaves only added to the monotony of The Grapes of Wrath.  When I finished the book, I tossed it down and said, ""Man, that was ponderous.""  And then I realized the brilliance of Steinbeck.  He wanted me to feel what the intinerant farmers felt.\n\n<u>Primer</u> is confusing because that's what the two men felt.  It's confusing to you because it was confusing to them.";It's Supposed to Be Confusing
94;4.0;5.0;86.0;"I saw this film on a whim with little knowledge of the story or acclaims.  My physics background definitely helped me get a better grasp of the complex subject matter.  Don't get me wrong, I left the theatre as dazed and confused as most people did.  But, it was somewhere along the lines of complete awe.\n\nThis film is probably one of the best films I've seen dealing with time travel.  The grainy, washed out quality of the film gave it a realistic documentary style.  I didn't see the comparisons with Memento that most people refer to.  The feeling I got from the movie was closer to the intesity I felt when I watched The Insider.  I just felt tense and uneasy as the characters fiddled with their new ""toy"".  The soundtrack had a very good ambient touch that helped add emphasis to the seriousness of the film.\n\nSo, in short; if you like intellectual, intense, dramatic, sci-fi movies, then you'll like this film.  And, yes it may be a little to artsy for some.  If Timecop is your favorite movie then you probably won't like Primer (jab).";Unconventionally Fresh
99;5.0;3.0;45.0;"Winner of two prestigious Sundance Film Festival awards, this short (78 minute) film contains enough subtle hints to make Memento a simple-to-follow piece of work.  That's a sarcastic jab, for those in the know.\n\nThis is very hard to follow and yes, does take several viewings to even begin to figure out what's going on, but as the reviewer for a highly reputable NY City newspaper said, even after several viewings the viewer may come away confused.\n\nOne of the problems, if I may say so, is that there is essentially no emotional resonance in the film.  This is purely a work of intellect.  The fact that I had read a lot about the film before I saw it helped to such an extent that if I had not read anything beforehand, I probably would not have been aware of what was going on.\n\nFour engineers are looking for a way to make some serious cash.  They initially discuss what sounds like a software venture, but at the same time, two (Abe and Aaron) are tinkering around with a device in Aaron's garage.  These two are friends; another reviewer pointed out that this is a character-driven film, but one suspects that you have to be able to identify how engineers, and especially young engineers, relate to each other to sense their friendship.  There is no smiling, no laughter, no sense of camaraderie.\n\nThe ""friendship"" is based strictly on respect for each other's intellect.  Of course such friendships exist, but when what appears to be some pretty strange things start happening, the total lack of emotional response on the part of either one of these guys means that the audience has that much tougher a time to understand what is happening because there are no links--not even points of light--to identify when something odd is happening as opposed to something ordinary.\n\nThe thing that they are tinkering around with in the garage evolves into a machine/device/gizmo/whatever that allows them to see ahead in time.  In so doing, they generate temporary doubles of themselves.  When they refer to these doubles, it is so matter-of-fact that one would think not only that they knew in advance this would happen, but that this is just another typical event in the life of a bright engineer.\n\nKey to understanding the tone of this dry work is a line spoken by an older engineer near the beginning of the film.  He says, ""What do they do with engineers when they reach the age of 40?""  The answer--""They take them out and shoot them.""  Abe and Aaron are both well below 40 and their tremendously intense stares, rapid fire speech, and markedly oblique language labels them as those who live in nothing but their own world.\n\nThus what is really needed to understand this film is the ability to identify with--to get inside the head of--someone with this kind of thinking.  That is, the viewer really has to be able to shift his/her style of perceiving/thinking/knowing to one that emphasizes rapid grasp of concepts including leaps of cognition that most of us do not make in our day-to-day lives.  The fact that the film won awards means, I think, that the awards committee was highly impressed with how comprehensively the filmmaker, Shane Carruth, was able to convey the completely intense mindset of engineers not even 30 years old, more than anything else.\n\nAs well as lacking in emotional resonance, this is not primarily a visual film either.  It is a film that emphasizes ideas over everything else, that focuses like a white-hot poker on the mind and how it jumps like a flea on methedrine trying to survive a hot plate--from concept to concept--with such speed and with so many sudden turns that to even try to delineate them all is essentially futile.\n\nThe real question is, is it worth it?  It's hard to say.  For those who enjoy puzzles, sure it is.  This is obviously not a Hollywood film; the filmmaker, in fact, has done everything he could to make an ANTI-Hollywood film and in that he has succeeded.  But it is a film with ferocious intelligence and if nothing else, should be lauded for that.\n\nI am still uncertain of how to rate this, and so I have given it three stars.";A real puzzler
75;6.0;3.0;41.0;"Aaron and Abe are two brainiac engineers trying to come up with a new concept that'll help them get published and, hopefully, make them some money. But nothing seems to be working in their favor ...until ...they accidentally stumble upon something of a time machine while working in Abe's garage. At first it just seems to be a machine that can decrease the size and weight of an object, something that could save companies like NASA billions of dollars in payload lifting. But they soon find that the machine ISN'T decreasing weight and size, it's moving the item back in time.\n\nInitially Abe and Aaron use their newfound discovery to help them make money (they travel back one day in time to find out what the stock market was doing and put their money into stocks that blossom the next day). But the risks are greater than they could've imagined. You've got to stay away from anyplace that your double might be, and you can't interact with anyone on your trip back or you could screw up the time-line. What they don't know, couldn't know really, is that they've gone into a time loop (something that repeats itself over and over and over again), but the loop changes because of what each of them knows about the future and what they can get out of it.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nIf this sounds confusing, it is. The concept is beyond the grasp of normal individuals (with the exception being time theorists and engineers), so that's partly why I only gave it three stars.\n\nThe incredible thing about the film that made it watchable is that the concept, although REALLY out there, was fresh. There was no time machine, per se, but a little box that resembled a coffin in which you stuck yourself into while your doppleganger wandered around and did your bidding. Again, don't get your brain into a twist over this; it's complicated science.\n\nThe filming was pretty amazing, too. Done on a shoestring budget of just $7,000, it looks and feels like a professionally shot movie. There's no wobbly camera movements, no out of focus shots, etc. There were a few times when the sound was less than optimal, but it wasn't anything that bothered me too much.\n\nThe parts of the film that bothered me most were the dialogue and the out-of-reach message that most movie viewers will never, ever get. The dialogue was both beyond me (I'm not an engineer or a time theorist) and difficult to hear due to overlapping conversations. Now I know that this might be how real engineers talk, but does that translate into good dialogue on film? I think not. The message of the film is in there, but it's buried so deeply in the engineer double-speak and concept of the movie that most viewers will never be able to find it.\n\nThis isn't the type of film you can watch once and think you have a grasp of what it's all about. Trust me, it'll take at least three viewings.\n\nWhat surprises me most is that this film won the Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. A science fiction movie? Winning an independent film award? Will the wonders never cease?";What a Concept!
69;7.0;4.0;38.0;"If you like cerebral movies and twisty, problematic plots; films that leave you thinking - like that haunting feeling you may have had after you first saw ""The Matrix""... you'll likely enjoy this flick.\n\n(Think: THX-1138, I Heart Huckabees, The Matrix, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pi, A Boy And His Dog, etc.)\n\nIf you just want to sit and veg infront of a motion picture, you like ""feel good movies"", or like big noises, special effects, high drama & action for drama & action's sake (not that there's anything wrong with this at all - think: Hitch, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Out of Africa, or Star Trek - The Movie), then this movie will likely leave you wanting.  It is, relatively speaking, a geek movie.  And not in the sense of ""Real Genius"".\n\nYou can read as much as you like about the plot, etc. in other reviews.  I choose not to give away too much about specifics in my reviews.\n\nThe part that I really liked about this movie is its exploration into what happens in the human character and their relationships when they stumble onto a resource that provides great benefit and huge circumstance, and yet don't really fully understand or prepare themselves for how/why it works or the implications it brings with it.  The juxtaposition of being in a situation that is unfolding with unprecidented information allowing one to predictably alter said situation's outcome - and then dealing with the newly generated results, that one could not so easily predict - heady stuff.  Add to that some plausible sounding science (fiction) and recursive situational examination, and you have a formula for a great story that requires you to focus.\n\nAnd THAT'S what this movie requires - your undivided focused attention.  Be ready to THINK, solve, and be mentally challenged.  I think that is why this movie won awards - it's challenging subject matter that revolves around complex situations, both technically and psychologically.  The questions it raises can be haunting indeed.\n\nThe fact that it is an incredibly low budget film is both astounding and supplies a vehicle for confusion.  The actors are first timers (as is the writer/director/editor/janitor/camera operator... you get the idea.)  This means that there is no room for verbose explanation.  YOU have to stay alert and figure stuff out.  There is no ""high emotion"" drama occuring as these are not trained method actors.  And at the same time, personlly (having been a technoid for a long time), I think they do a very good job of depicting how intellectual, engineering types would approach/react/respond to the situations presented in the story.\n\nIf you are a techie, scientist, metaphysician, psychologist, etc. or a fan of any of these, then you will probably dig this somewhat unsettling romp.\n\nIf not - if you don't like engineering/techno-babble stuff or movies that require you to THINK/SOLVE, don't bother wasting your $ or time.  Wait for it to hit network TV when it's free and there's no guilt in hitting the Channel +/- button.\n\nLastly, I have to say that it is a very clean-cut movie.  There's really no violence, no sexual themes, and little to no profanity (it got a PG-13 rating because the word 'fags' was spoken once).  I really appreciate that as well.\n\nI give it 4 stars because I like intellectual teasers that pose introspective questions.  And because it was created for next to nothing, yet provides (me) a level of entertainment at a level of a John Carpenter, George Lucas, etc. $$$$$$ movie.  While it's not about the presentation as much as the content, the low-budget  look & feel seem only to add to this movie's presentation making it perhaps a bit more accessible or 'real'.";Not for everyone and great for some
25;8.0;4.0;28.0;"TRESCA-PRIME: Primer is a no-frills science fiction film that details a realistic portrayal of time travel.  Like Donnie Darko, it examines what happens when humans discover they can influence time...and then just how little control they really have over it.  Aaron (Shane Carruth) and Abe (David Sullivan) struggle to create a magnetic invention in their garage, only to stumble upon time travel.  And once Pandora's Box is opened, there's no going back.  In no time (pun intended), they're sending themselves into the past.  This leads to a perpetual struggle to avoid paradoxes that most time travel stories don't consider. When duplicate cell phones are in the same time stream, which one rings first? Can you really avoid changing the outcome of reality simply by avoiding your prime self? And who is really the ""first"" prime anyway?  The film explores all these possibilities, which makes it an interesting ""what-if"" scenario that exponentially spins more and more questions. That said, I have to admit that my first viewing of Primer wasn't all that favorable.  The dialogue sounds like it came out of Clerks, the film is often grainy and choppy, and there's almost no action whatsoever throughout the script.  Perhaps my future selves will have a different opinion.\n\nTRESCA-2: On second viewing, the term ""Primer"" takes on new meaning.  Primer can mean an introductory textbook, and indeed we discover that Aaron was providing a guideline for future events to his Prime self--in other words, a textbook of sorts as to how to relive his life again without causing a paradox.  Primer can also mean white paint, used coat something for the first time.  As Aaron discovers he can go back in time, he begins to whitewash events, making himself look like a hero and giving himself the best possible outcomes.  But are these changes merely cosmetic, like paint?  Finally, there's the notion of Primer as an explosive, setting off a disastrous chain of events.  And the end of the film leaves us with the certainty that something very bad is about to happen.\n\nTRESCA-4: Another alternative my former selves hadn't thought of was Primer as being first and primary.  Once Aaron discovers the ability to create multiple versions of himself, he becomes increasingly obsessed with controlling them.  And of course, each Aaron in the past feels exactly the same way. So how do you become the prime?  How do you become the person who is control of your own destiny?  How do you become your own God? Aaron and Abe (Abraham) are Biblical names and their inclusion is certainly not an accident.\n\nTRESCA-8: Seeing the movie again really makes you appreciate exactly how much work went into crafting Primer.  Dialogue and scenes that seem odd and disjointed make perfect sense when you realize it's the time doubles tweaking the timeline. The more duplicates that get involved, the more the film becomes fuzzy and unfocused, a sometimes annoying but important visual cue.  And always there is the suspicion that something is off, from the ""rats in the attic"" to Abe waking up laying face down on the floor, to the fact that Aaron doesn't want to ""talk to those kids who hang out"" with Abe.  Why?  Multiple viewings tie it together.\n\nTRESCA-16: Primer is probably one of the most realistic portrayals of time travel science in recent memory, but that doesn't necessarily make it an engaging film.  Primer strains our patience.  Most of the time, the characters stand around chatting with each other from innovative camera angles.  The climactic moment, a scene where an ex-boyfriend shows up with a shotgun at a party, is never even shown.  And the grainy footage, the monotone dialogue, the talking-over-each-other style of acting, all make the film seem more like a reality show than a movie.  It doesn't have the slick sensibilities of Donnie Darko or the neatly wrapped storyline of Groundhog Day.  And yet, the nihilistic outcome of the film is too powerful to ignore, sticking with you through multiple future viewings.\n\nIn short, Primer is both a fantastic piece of thoughtful science fiction and a challenging viewing experience.  By all means watch it.  You owe it to your future selves.";You Owe it to Your Future Selves to Watch It
97;9.0;3.0;30.0;"Engineer turned filmmaker Shane Carruth's debut film, ""Primer,"" examines the overwrought theme of time travel in an expressive, refreshing light.\n\nFilmed with a budget of $7,000, which hardly covered the cost of its 16mm film stock and camera rental, ""Primer"" is by no means the next obtrusive sci-fi PG-13 Hollywood blockbuster.  Often compared to ""Memento"" and ""Pi,"" the film utilizes neither special effects nor flashy spectacle, yet creates an astounding world both scientifically complex yet personally grounded.\n\nWriter/director/star Carruth's story revolves around four friends who, outside of their suit-and-tie jobs, spend hours of their free time in a garage working on an ambiguous science project.  There are moments of frustration and failure, but ultimately efforts result in a box-like machine that has various unmatchable capabilities; most intriguingly, it can ""degrade"" time.  Given the machine's potential, the men realize that they have created something too dangerous to market.  The question is then, how not let its technology go to waste.\n\nTechnically, as the story shifts to a focus on the two main characters, Aaron (Carruth) and Abe (up-and-coming actor David Sullivan), ""Primer"" turns to a path frighteningly close to the clich time travel story.  While exploiting the possibilities of time travel with newly built human-sized boxes, Abe and Aaron soon realize the inconceivable dangers they have brought upon themselves and those they love.  Haven't we seen this before?\n\nHowever, the film's low budget and close knit cast and crew ultimately shine through brightly.  The Grand Jury Prize at Sundance is not awarded carelessly.  With an entire supporting cast consisting of friends and family of its unpaid stars, who also doubled as the crew, there is a sense of trust and unity emanated by the actors' performances and the film itself.  It becomes clear that the volatile relationship between Abe and Aaron is truly the centerpiece of the film's script.\n\nYet the film's greatest success sadly lies in its ability to confuse the viewer.  The time in which events take place, the characters involved, and the reasons for various actions become blurred.  And with a 78 minute running time, there is certainly a yearning for more.\n\nWhile the scientific aspects of the film are neither sufficiently thorough nor simple, the core of the film lies in its emotion.  ""Primer,"" beautifully shot in an amateur yet sophisticated style, appeals to a mature audience able to delve into the profundity of the human spirit.  Underneath the stolid science and unavoidable confusion, there is a human sensitivity that we all can relate to.";Refreshing look at overwrought themes
7;10.0;5.0;14.0;"Primer is the most realistic science fiction movie I've ever seen, and hands down the best time travel movie of all time! Many time travel stories depend on invoking either nostalgia for long-passed days or dystopian fear of distant futures. Still others depend on far-fetched occurrences and/or special effects to achieve their goal. Primer, on the other hand, is in a class all its own. To begin with, the time travel destinations are only hours or days removed from the present. This is part of what gives the film its very puzzling quality, as people do not age noticeably nor do environments change drastically within a few days time span. As a result of this, the chronology of the film must be deduced primarily from the behavior, intentions, and dialogue of the characters; behavior which is unpredictable, intentions which evolve as the film moves along, and dialogue which is awesomely scientific. As other reviewers have pointed out, the writer/director/protagonist/composer makes no attempt to dumb down the conceptual framework and overall temporal complexity within which the film operates. Primer is difficult to understand. Whether you are a scientist or a science fiction fan, the first time you watch it you will probably only fully comprehend about half of it. But this, for me, is the film's best quality. The urge to rewatch it is immediate due to the fascination invoked by what was not comprehended. At this point I have watched it several times, and each time it makes more sense to me, however I still do not fully comprehend it.\n\nDifficulties aside, Primer is a beautiful film with top-notch cinematography and an amazing score. It is very refreshing to see a science fiction film without the standard barrage of computer-generation and overly-dramatic music. Any ""special effects"" experienced are the result of very well-thought-out shots combined with skillful editing. The music is well-placed, optimistically melancholy, and at the same time invokes an undeniable sense of wonder and possibility. The acting is down-to-earth and believable. The characters portrayed are not superhuman and do not have unlimited resources. The feeling that you get from the film is that you have become a witness to actual extraordinary events. In my opinion there is no other science fiction film (time travel or otherwise) that accomplishes this feat as well as Primer.";The Best Time Travel Movie Ever
9;11.0;1.0;12.0;"Normally, I'd preface this type of review with a bold ""SPOILER ALERT"", but I suspect those who've yet to see this film couldn't make sense of the spoilers anyway. I'm not sure one can really ""spoil"" such a convoluted plot even if they tried.\n\nI'd like to give this film 5-stars for its originality and a very creative concept in the best tradition of Arthur C. Clarke (as noted is a few other reviews), but a lot of that creativity was lost on a plot that became too obtuse and burdensome for its own good -- which is why I have to give it a 1-star.  I like films that are intellectually challenging but prefer not to have my brain fried during the experience. And that's the quandary I had with ""Primer"", it was too smart and too film-school artsy for it's own good; it's one ripping science fiction yarn that kinda went off into the film festival weeds with way more abstraction than what was needed to tell a relatively simple, but good, story.\n\nThe main stumbling block for me:  the plot could've been greatly simplified without losing its appeal. The audience really deserves a few more clues and guideposts along the way to make the cinematic journey that much more enjoyable without sacrificing artistic creativity or the intended meaning of the film. As any good writer knows, stay out of the way of a good idea and let the words flow naturally -- don't embellish, don't add unnecessary artifices for the sake of appearing ""artistic""!\n\nOn the plus-side, I enjoyed the style and texture of the film from a geeky-person's point of view; the scripting was so natural I thought I was watching a historical documentary. No CGI, no special effects of any kind (although that levitation machine they build in their garage was kind of cool). You don't need a lot of zap-bang-boom-pow effects, battling mega-robots, mindless car chases with somersaulting SUV's, naked body-doubles performing simulated sex to keep people's attention when you have a GOOD STORY to tell!\n\nOn the minus side: the plot had WAY TOO MANY versions of Aaron, Abe, boxes and fail-safe boxes to keep track of without the aid of a spreadsheet. What the story lacked was just enough continuity to hold the plot together long enough for people to figure out what was going on. I eventually figured out most of it -- except for the the final scene in the ""warehouse"". Frankly, I think there were points in the film where the writer/director/actor wasn't entirely sure what was going on.\n\nIt seems clear to me (after multiple viewings) that the ""beginning"" of the film really wasn't the beginning at all given that the first rendition of Abe was, in fact, a time traveler who made the first trip in the machine and traveled back six hours to inform his partner, Aaron (sitting on the park bench) that the trip was successful. He proved it buy taking Aaron to the storage facility where we see the ""original"" Abe returning to the machine after leaving the hotel.  After that, things got real complicated to the point where we have not one but THREE Aarons running around -- ""hoodie"" Aaron, ""original"" Aaron locked up in an attic and rendition #2 Aaron.  Now add in another version of Abe to the mix along with two ""fail safe"" machines and you have a real mess.  Oh, and don't forget, these time machines are portable -- you can fold one up and take with you back to the past.  Enough, already!!!!!!\n\nWhich brings us to the brief final scene: one of the Aarons splits from one of the Abe's at the airport and ends up in this big warehouse directing some sort of activity, presumably building a larger version of the time machine. Many commentators & reviewers saw no special significance in this scene, but I thought it was a rather odd way to end the movie, especially given the low budget -- why shoot unnecessary footage?  And what was with the French-speaking dude directing that crowd of hard-hatted works in the warehouse?\n\nI now believe the entire movie was intended to depict a corrupted time line from the get-go and the Aaron we saw in the warehouse was, in fact, the original Aaron (as opposed to the Aaron locked in the attic).  If you have a better idea, please let me know.";Great Concept, Poor Execution
59;12.0;1.0;23.0;I rather liked the first half of this movie. The technical jargon and overlapping dialog didn't bother me (I'm an engineer myself), and the premise of accidentally inventing a time machine is promising. But the second half of the film becomes increasingly disjointed and incoherent as the paradoxes pile up, and by the end I was completely lost. Assuming the story DOES actually make sense, I suppose it might be untangled by repeated viewing, but I'm not inclined to bother ... I've read dozens of time paradox stories, and this one just isn't very interesting. (Try David Gerrold's THE MAN WHO FOLDED HIMSELF for an example of how to do it well.)\n\nMuch is being made of the fact that the film was made for just a few thousand dollars. Well, it doesn't look or sound cheap, and the actors are competent enough. But the key to a good movie is the script, and this one is unlikely to appeal to anyone but hardcore geeks. Indie filmmakers may want to study it, though.\n\nIf you liked PI, you might like this too. But PI is better.;What if it DOESN'T work? ... A real geekfest
36;13.0;4.0;22.0;'Primer' is a film about that most famed and classic sci-fi concept, time travel.  Many films about time travel simply use it as a plot device, a way to get their characters to a different age, but 'Primer' is one of those works that's interested in the concept of time travel in and of itself, and the complications and paradoxes inherent in such activities.  Needless to say, it doesn't explain or resolve these concerns, indeed they can't be resolved, but it does result in a very interesting, dense film.  Like many, probably most viewers of the film, I wasn't entirely sure what had happened as the film ended the first time around.  I got a better, much more certain grip on it after watching it a second time, and I actually think the movie became a bit less interesting when it's more fully understood, but it's still an intriguing web.\n\nThe film opens by introducing us to 4 young engineer types who work together on side projects in their spare time.  Frankly, we don't know too much of what they're actually doing, we just watch them work for a while as the group is pared down to two central figures, Abe and Aaron, who create a strange new invention, which they contain in a small steel box.  Even they're not entirely sure what it is or what it does, but their experimenting with it reveals that objects contained within the box are removed from the conventional timeline, and they eventually discover that this device can allow them to travel backwards in time.  The rest of the film shows us the difficulties that come from their experimenting with the machine.  These opening sections alone will doubtless scare some people off, as they're filled with techspeak. It's not as hard to understand as some would have you believe, but maybe I just let the words and concepts I'm unfamiliar with fly by with out concern because, in the end, this stuff doesn't much matter.  They are making.... something, somehow.  How they do it doesn't matter all that much, it's just a play to sell you on the reality of the film and draw you in, and it worked for me, anyway.\n\nThe time machines themselves are intriguingly different from what you'd usually see in a modern sci-fi film.  Again, they're just boxes, and you travel backwards in time simply by sitting in them after they've heated up.  Furthermore, you only move backwards in real time, i.e. you get in the box at 6 P.M. and stay there for 6 hours and it's now noon.  This sort of time travel is amusingly mundane, allowing for simple practical problems and benefits, and forcing the characters to continuously deal with potential timeline deviations as they're living through an immediate past where their past self currently exists.  Thus, it comes down to living the same day twice, the first time around planning it all out, the second time reaping the benefits.  Of course, the short timeline means that they aren't allowed to advance particularly ambitious goals, not much beyond making money on the stock market, but Writer/Director/Actor/Everything Shane Carruth does a good exploring the sort of complications related to such short distance time travel, and this is where the major intrigue of the film comes in.  For example, Aaron, at one point, brings his cell phone with him on one of their trips, and it rings.  This begs the question, is the time symmetry affected?  Is his other cell phone also ringing?  They don't know.  They also note small, amusing points, like how the storage unit security guard always sees them come in to gain access to the time machine, but never sees them come out, and how they must, the first time thru the day, bring in an extra car in the morning to the storage facility, as the car that they take there won't actually be there yet when they get out.  Obviously, the potential complications of time travel have been considered before, but you usually don't see this kinda contemplation in a film, and it felt relatively new and different to me, anyway.  And, again, it's interesting to see a film with simple, everyday concerns related to time travel rather than just the bigger overlying concepts.\n\nThe film can be quite difficult to follow, as it, for the most part, simply moves forward in the later timelines of the film, rather than just showing us the very first, original timeline and then the various permutations.  For example, we see that Abe has traveled back in time before we learn that they have the ability to do so--  After all, he traveled back in time to *before* he was actually was able to do so in order to discuss it with Aaron, so this is the scene that we actually watch.  This also allows for some unanswered questions which are legitimately left unanswered.  For example,  at one point they notice that one Mr. Granger has used the time machine and now has a double, but neither they nor us knows why. Again, they haven't told him about it *yet*, so why would they know?  Eventually things spiral out of control, as Aaron and Abe have ideas about manipulating the past beyond simply cheating at the stock market, and they grow paranoid and lose their trust for one another and so on, leading to problems relating to maintaining the timeline and dealing with doubles and so on.  I won't go in to too many specifics, and while the final third of the picture can be tough to follow it is, again, interesting.\n\nThis film was really shot on the cheap.  Reportedly a miniscule $7,000.  It's a fairly professional affair considering that, cleanly and competently shot, and with acceptable acting.  (Fortunately, the film is very staid, with the characters generally discussing things in a calm manner, thus requiring little real acting or emoting).  The picture is pretty damn grainy at times, and the sound isn't always too hot, but it's never painful to watch, and even has some nice cinematography at moments.\n\nYeah, this is a neat film.  I don't think it's quite the mind puzzle that most people make it out to be, though I certainly don't claim to be 100% sure of everything that happened, but it's definitely a lot more dense and intriguing than the vast majority of the films out there. (I must also note, however, that I don't really think that everything is supposed to tie itself together cleanly and clearly, no matter how carefully you look at it.  Indeed, the fact that it can't all be put together is the major point, and that the situation has become to complicated to be surely dissected.)  Definitely worth a look if this is your kinda thing.\n\nGrade: B+;Very Interesting
62;14.0;1.0;22.0;"I love Memento and time travel flicks in general...\n\nI saw Ebert review this and thought it looked really neat.  So the story begins, with 4 science geeks babbling incoherent tech-speak.  Okay, no problem I thought, it's just like on ER when they ask for 300 CC's of hippopotacextradrine because a patient's inflabial corpusal is collapsing.\n\nSo I just tuned that out and waited for it to pass, and for the ""this is what all of that stuff earlier meant"" phase of the film.  But that moment never came.\n\nThey build a box, box sends things back in time, they build big boxes to send themselves back in time...that's the plot...\n\nThen for some reason, there are doubles of themselves walking around and they have to hide from them in a hotel room for 6 hours every day.  This is NEVER EXPLAINED!!!\n\nThen some other characters conveniently walk in and mumble something about a party and a guy with a shotgun...\n\nThat's the other thing about the movie...what isn't technical speak mumbo jumbo, is too mumbled and muffled to hear anyway!\n\nSo later in the film they're at a party trying to stop a murder or something I guess...I had completely forgotten about the party/shotgun comment from earlier.  Were they planning this out in the meantime?  I have no idea...either we were supposed to assume it or it was all muffled, who knows...\n\nAnd then there was a drunk that jumped in their machine or something...\n\nAnd they wear earpieces telling them recordings of what happened from their doppelganger doubles...or something...\n\nAnd they repeat word-for-word these conversations...I guess...\n\nAnd then one of them moves to France...or something...\n\nI'm assuming there was a twist where they find out they are the doppelganger doubles...I honestly have no idea because it is never spelled out, never explained, and if it was explained, then the audio was so horrible that I couldn't make it out...\n\nIt's pretty bad when you wish you had watched an English-language film with English subtitles...\n\nGee...what a masterpiece!";It isn't even watchable...
8;15.0;1.0;10.0;I am amazed by all the good reviews for this film! I am a huge science fiction fan and love time travel pieces. I also have some experience with independent films, go to several film festivals each year, and try to help support indie filmmakers as much as I can. Upon this film popping up in the amazon suggestions list when trying to find a film to watch with my father (another huge science fiction fan), reading the synopsis, and reading bunches of great reviews I decided to rent it and check this seemingly good indie film out. What I discovered was a crappy indie film that looks like it was made by high school students with no film experience, stoners, or both... an unoriginal storyline, mediocre acting, and a headache. My father fell asleep.\n\nSupposedly the filmmakers had a $7K budget and I see a few reviewers praising the film for its beauty considering their low budget. What?! The film looks grainy, out of focus, and shaky all the way through! That has nothing to do with budget (I have seen much better looking films made for a lot less) and everything to do with someone not knowing what the heck they are doing with their camera. I guess you could argue that with their low budget they couldn't afford to hire a cameraman with experience but I say why couldn't they educate themselves for free by reading a few 101 how to use a camera guides via their local library. To make things worse, in editing they seem to have color corrected everything to look either yellow, orange, or green depending on the scene. I am guessing they were trying to be inventive and artsy trying to color code things depending on the emotions they wanted to convey in each part of the film but it just didn't work for me. It looked like bad florescent lighting through and through. Helped build up my headache beautifully though.\n\nSound is a whole other issue in this film. It is bad! Every characters sounds like they are mumbling through a 1920's radio. Add to this the fact that the characters are all talking over one another and the filmmakers made the music and sound effects tracks substantially louder then the dialog track and you got yourself a confusing film. Not because it is anything great or interesting, not that the plot is so grand in complexness that it is confusing... simply that the film is so badly shot and the sound is so screwed up that you can barley hear or see anything so you have to put on the closed captioning to try to follow along.\n\nStoryline you ask? Unoriginal. ***SPOILERS***  Two guys stumble upon making a time machine, start using it and experimenting with changing the timeline, some crap goes wrong and they start shoving their other selves into nooks and crannies while continuing to mess with the timeline, one of them comes to the realization that maybe they shouldn't be doing this and tries to convince his friend to stop too, his friend claims to move on but in reality starts building a whole new time machine. THE END.\n\nSimplified but accurate.\n\nYes there is some jumping around and trying to confuse the audience with who is who in the timeline and what is going on but all in all I found the story boring, characters unappealing,and quality appalling. For more interesting stories (films and movies in no particular order) concerning time travel and/or alternate timelines watch: The Twilight Zone, Doctor Who (old or new), Back to the Future, The Time Machine, Planet of the Apes, Quantum Leap, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Star Trek, Time Bandits, Groundhog Day, The Terminator, Army of Darkness, 12 Monkeys, Memento, Butterfly Effect, Austin Powers, Andromeda, Timeline, The Outer Limits, Stargate, The Kid, Fringe, Eureka, Hot Tub Time Machine, Looper, Continuum... the list goes on.\n\nAs for Primer in whole... I watched it all the way through, understood its unoriginal storyline even though I'm sure someone will argue with me I didn't, and the only thing confusing to me after finishing the film is why so many people seem to like it so much. Don't waste your time or money.;Don't listen to the good reviews. This film sucks!
29;16.0;1.0;19.0;"Primer is arguably the slowest movie ever made, far from being a primer in time travel it seems to be an advanced tutorial in stopping time.  Imagine four Silicon Valley techno-geeks talking simultaneously into barely functioning mikes and you have Primer.  The plot, such as it is, has also traveled through time, revisit old episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to see for yourself.\n\nOn its face, the premise of time travel and the creation of alternate selves, manipulating or not manipulating events and thereby tinkering with the smooth continuum, would seem to be promising.  While it does prompt rather grandiose philosophical questions, (questions that exceed the grasp of Mr. Carruth who wrote, directed, starred, scored, edited, and painted the props), it defeats its purpose because there are simply too many possibilities.  Drama depends on well-defined situations and tension, in the silly-putty world of Primer, where anything can happen; there is no definition, tension, or suspense.\n\nNormally, when I learn that plucky kids made a movie for $7,000 I cheer, because Hollywood needs to know that big money does not equal quality.  (Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle is a stellar example of film excellence on a shoestring budget.)  When I hear that a film is a Sundance winner, I'm immediately interested because this often points me towards movies that are small, overlooked, and wonderful.  But no system is foolproof, and Primer snuck through the cracks.\n\nFor a mature look at time manipulation that does provide meaningful structure, try Last Year At Marienbad, Memento, or even Lost Highway.  Marienbad and Memento are brilliant, and Highway, while it leans heavily on signature Lynch weirdness to make its point, at least provides the visceral impact thoroughly lacking in Primer.  I'm afraid that Primer is little more than 78 minutes I'll never get back.";Waste Of Time Travel
5;17.0;1.0;8.0;"Please save room for me in the box; I'll be going back 2 hours to tell myself not to rent this movie.\n\nI think one of the major problems with this movie is that virtually every scene begins in mid-conversation... and (second big problem), the conversations are often unintelligible because four people are talking at the same time!  There is so much ambiguity and vagueness in the technical conversations about this box... I might have been engaged more in this movie if the writers had just been a bit more explicit and given some familiar scientific or engineering context to this discovery.  The movie, Timeline, does a great job of making a complex subject such as this accessible to the audience... this movie simply left me confused.";Left me confused.
95;18.0;5.0;18.0;"People throw around five stars on Amazon all the time, so I will to. I can't say Primer is the best movie out there, but it ranks with the best on enough levels that it's more than worth a watch.\n\nTopically, Primer is about a couple of guys who build a time machine. But the story is not just about engineers, it's told from and acted out through an engineer's perspective--the careful exploration and thoughtful design that the best engineers always exhibit with a new discovery. That is what separates it from every other story that has ever featured a time machine (as excellent as Back to the Future was), and that's the primary sense in which this is a perfect movie.\n\nIt's also a perfect movie in some other ways--the dark, grainy cinematography (evidence of the budget than of any preference for such shooting) grants the same ""this could really happen"" feeling as it does in ""Clerks."" The acting, too, done again by engineers, is an asset. The score is nerve-wracking piano keying, a great addition if a bit slow.\n\nSo here's the downside: I saw this movie once in NY on opening night with a friend who is, like I am, very oriented towards abstract thought. We both got most of what happened, and desired a second viewing to get the rest. But then I saw it with an MIT electrical engineering student in Cambridge, and she didn't get a bit of it. Straight over her head. So I give it five stars to anyone who is willing to do some abstract engineer thinking, but don't bother if you aren't.";Impeccable first effort
65;19.0;4.0;17.0;"It is difficult to appreciate a book or movie if you can't identify with one of the characters. Primer has two main characters who, despite some minor differences, are pretty much the same. If you can't relate to this character, you don't stand a very good chance of enjoying the film.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed this film without any handicaps allowed for budget. It wasn't, ""this is a good film for $7,000."" It was, ""this is a very good film."" If you don't have the budget, the script and the acting need to carry the film. I don't personally agree the acting was wooden, I thought the dialog and delivery was very realistic. It is one thing to have a cracking script, but writing a good script to be realized around the resources you have available is astonishing.\n\nI watched Primer three times. It isn't long - only about 80 minutes. Each time I watched it, new details emerged. I did not catch everything the first time through and that is ok, although sometimes it was a problem with the mechanics of putting together a film. For example, when Abe and Aaron lift off the box cover after a problem occurred, the director cut to black and then cut to Abe lying on the floor. I thought something happened to Abe, which confused me for a while. This would have easily been rectified by a fade out to black at that point instead of a hard cut. I'm guessing there was not enough footage available for a proper fade.\n\nAfter the weekend, I'm still thinking about the film and I love it when that happens. I don't have any bias towards Hollywood films, I like a good popcorn cruncher with explosions as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel the weight of the budget and the decision-making committee that goes along with it. You end up with entertaining films that don't really take too many chances. This is a really good antidote for that. If I'm watching something that is the product of a singular vision, I'm out of the safety box of focus groups and test screenings and that means that anything is possible. I love that.\n\nI hope Shane Carruth gets an opportunity to continue his film career. I wish him a bright future.\n\nRecommended for people who like independent films, geeks, time travel aficionados, people who have worked in startups, or around engineers.\n\nNot recommended for children, AARP members, people who don't like non-linear narrative, or dates.";Listen carefully.

68;20.0;2.0;17.0;"Okay, two guys figure out a way to go back in time a day or two at a time.  (They spend an annoyingly long time explaining this before getting to the point.)  They mostly use it to make money on the stock market.  At some point a small passing line was mentioned about some guy coming to a party with a shot gun.  Most of the movie didn't bother with the event at all, it was just mentioned in passing.  Suddenly we're at the end of the movie and they've been going back over and over again to mess with this one event without our knowledge.  This is the climax of the movie.  There was no rising action, no concentration on this... just suddenly, ""Oh hey this is what we were doing this whole time.""  It's like the first 2/3rds of the movie didn't matter.\n\nThis isn't a thriller, it's techie and boring with a good concept, but bad writing.  The engineer that came up with this idea should have hired a professional writer for the screenplay.  Then maybe people could follow it and there could actually be enough emotion invested in it to make the audience get involved, to make us want to care about these people.

21;23.0;5.0;14.0;"Perhaps my initial affinity for Primer arose because it's such an underdog.  With a budget of only $7000, the movie itself is virtually a garage invention (a garage invention about a garage invention).  Shane Carruth's direction and editing are as tight and spare as the movie's budget, to good effect. The plot flows smoothly --- when it's hard to follow, this reflects the course of events, which becomes increasingly nonlinear, and very weird.  Most people benefit from a second viewing, myself included.\n\nThe main characters, Aaron and Abe, are economically drawn, with just enough emphasis to distinguish their respective personalities and values.  They are what an ""everyman"" would be if everyone had some training in engineering.  The same can be said for the minor characters --- a few deft ""brush strokes"" tell us what we need to know about them, with a dash of humor as leavening.\n\nThe lack of big-budget special effects, or even standard digital tricks and enhancements, seems to actually help this movie.  The effects presented are spartan, artfully done, and far from cheesy despite their bargain-basement cost.  The brooding mysterious device at the center of the plot is utterly mundane in aspect: a few wires, gauges, disks, boxes, ominously humming, or revving into a grating screech of feedback --- just enough to present the convincing illusion of a jury-rigged garage invention.\n\nIf you don't mind a few spoilers, read on. Otherwise, go to the last paragraph.\n\nPrimer is hard SF, in that plausible (if speculative) scientific rules put up a palpable resistance to what can happen.  The machine, for all its wonder, is slow, grinding, and tedious to use, dangerous in subtle unknown ways.  There is no magic, at least not for the user, who can ""pop"" back to the past only at the expense of long hours of boredom or drugged somnolence in a ""coffin,"" exposed to God-knows-what forces. The machine takes ingenuity and work to construct, serendipity to discover its attributes, time and sweat to work out its potential.  The pair work out, a posteriori, a  plausible theory for the time travel effect --- plausible in that the laws of thermodynamics are not broken (maybe bent a bit), and plausible in that they can express it in a diagram, allowing the viewer to buy into the rules of play.  But the theory is clearly incomplete: it can't, for example, account for the small but increasingly corrosive changes inflicted on their physiology, and perhaps their sanity, with each use.  In every respect, the extent to which its dangers are unknowable is itself an unknown quantity.\n\nThe characters are flawed, average (if clever) human beings.  Stumbling upon a device of unfathomable potential, their budding ambitions are pathetically petty.  The wisest human on earth would be flummoxed at the logical and moral implications of their invention.  These guys' first impulses are to attempt to beat the stock market, or, later, to time-engineer a perfect heroic moment, for gratitude and praise.  Faced with a new world of fathomless potential, power, and complexity, they respond with personal greed and vainglory.  Very human.  Very familiar.\n\nThe world --- our world --- after discovery of the time device will be changed beyond all recognition, in ways that defy enumeration or categorization (""The permutations were endless""). We viewers only witness the tiniest fraction of the beginning of --- what?  What will causality be when the consequences of actions you have yet to perform double back to the present and bite you in the a__ (a la Grainger).  How many histories will the world go through?  Most of these histories would conceivably never leave any trace, since ""the last revision is the one that counts.""  Occasionally a character (like the narrator?) will find himself become a relic, sandwiched between timelines, who survives to tell his tale.  Will there be battles between ""forces of Aaron"" and ""forces of Abe?""  Will there be armies of human copies of copies?  How physically or mentally blurred and distorted will they become as errors propagate down these strings of copied real-life ""images""? Who else will find out the secret? And what in Tophet will the world look like when such machines become widely available?  Could a stable solution to the resulting worldwide iterative crazy-quilt process of timeline one-upmanship possibly evolve, or would history fractionate into a hopeless tangle of time loops and broken symmetries, expanding chaotically into the space-time continuum? An era of fractal history?  Or something there is not even a word for?\n\nPrimer has been compared to Stanley Kubrik's and Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odessey.  While the differences between these movies (budget being the most obvious one) are too numerous to count, I can put my finger on the similarity.  There is a feeling at the end of Primer that the author has opened a Pandora's box in our heads, with ramifications as awesome, limitless, and potentially terrifying, as those symbolized by the 2001 ""Star Child.""  The technology has taken humanity to a tipping point, and nothing will ever be the same.  Even ""ever"" will never be the same.  The feeling stays with us, long after we have fried our brains working out the movie's timeline convolutions and logical conundrums, teasing our reality at the edges of awareness and imagination.";Why do I love Primer?

The head scratching is not due to any plot holes or lack of tight writing, however; it's merely the result of the mind blowing thought experiment that Carruth brings to life in the film.

4;26.0;1.0;5.0;I watched hundreds of movies in my life, lots of them Sci-Fi, many of them good, most of them mediocre but enjoyable. Primers is the first one where I was genuinely happy for it to be finally over.\n\nThe idea behind it is certainly intriguing but the execution is borderline trash. I'm not going to go into too much detail (others already did),so here's quick run-down of the main things this movie does wrong:\n\n- Visual quality is below average and the budget is no excuse for that. You'd get better quality with a 200$ used DSLR than this non-sense.\n\n- Audio is even worse, horrible mixing (you barely understand the actors at times) and very bad dialogue execution where several people talk over each other. I've been in a lot of discussions about technical stuff (ideas, reviews etc.) in my life and if there's one thing that never happens, it's 4 people talking over each other.\n\n- Writing is plain bad. It's complicated and confusing, taking great care to not explain anything and if some explaining is indeed happening, making sure it is so convoluted that you can't follow.\nI know this is on purpose to convey the confusion of the main characters to the viewer but here's the thing - the concept isn't really that complex. The script is complicating things on purpose by leaving out vital information and compressing any attempt of an explanation into a few lines of obscure dialogue.\nNot to mention the final ten minutes of a completely detached story-line involving a random birthday party and the two main characters trying to change something about it. We don't get to know what or why but honestly, at this point I didn't even care anymore.\n\nThe movie has some great ideas behind it, even some good scenes (well, attempts of good scenes) but the execution is so bad that in the end it's simply a waste of time.;Interesting concept, amateurish execution.
11;27.0;5.0;7.0;"Why is it that as soon as a DVD goes temporarily out of print, those with copies to sell raise the price anywhere from 400-1000%? Previously, I bought two copies of this DVD from Amazon for about $10 each. After watching it several times, I gave them to friends as gifts. I logged onto Amazon today to buy another copy (for myself) only to find that the opportunistic profiteers are now asking anywhere from $40 to over $100 for it. As one might suspect, this leads to a lose-lose situation. I lose the ability (or at least the willingness) to buy and enjoy this DVD, and they lose the sale.\n  With that said, Primer is a wonderful movie about the discovery of the technology to enable time travel. I have no doubt that if the ability to travel through time is ever discovered, that discovery will take place exactly as portrayed in this film. Written from a fly on the wall standpoint, anyone who has read Hackers by Stan Levy, or is familiar with the early days of Apple Computers (when Steve Jobs was still working out of his garage) will feel dj vu all over again ;) Everything is so believable it's scary. It's the reality that wasn't (or was it?).\n  Admittedly, it's the type of movie that best appeals to fans of ""hard science"" fiction. There are no special effects, no wisecracking aliens, no supernatural forces... just a technology beyond our present level of understanding.

87;28.0;4.0;13.0;"My husband is a HUGE fan of time travel movies, and when he heard about a film called Primer winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, he wanted me to keep an eye out for it to add to our online rental queue.\n\nThere's a whole lot of talking in the first 15 minutes or so. It's kind of aggravating because you can't hear what they're saying because they're speaking over each other. (Found out later when listening to the director commentary that it was rehearsed many, many times...to give a feel of improvisation).\n\nI had a feeling that if we hung in there, we'd be rewarded. Some movies...you just get that feeling.\n\nYes, the plot is convoluted. The director wanted to stay true to ""real science"", so the back-and-forth talking was, well, real science. I just wished that it was mentioned early on just *what* they were building in the garage! (You find out through the director commentary that they were building a superconductor. Don't remember even hearing that in the movie.) Rather, there's a lot of techno-speak about freon, freezing points, and so on.\n\nI have to say that I knew nothing about this film when watching it. I was struck by some of the unusual camera angles...I felt like I was watching art. The acting was incredibly believable, and the sound ""effects"" were organic and analog. Found out through the commentary that this was the director's precise intent. You don't get the feeling that you're watching a slick Hollywood production; instead, you feel like you're literally a part of these guys' pet projects.\n\nAs time goes on, tension builds and a sense of foreboding enters the picture. There were quite a few scenes where I gripped my husband's hand and my stomach was in knots. I said to him ""Man, this is like a horror film!"" I don't like slashers, or even horror films, but my idea of ""horror"" was the implications of what those guys were doing in the garage...and then, later, in the U-Haul storage center.\n\nSurprisingly, the director and writer was also the main star. He's a *wonderful* actor that looks a bit like Keanu Reeves. The guy playing Abe was just as good. And the shots...to *think* that this guy filmed in his proverbial backyard is amazing. There's some really great shots in this film. And you know what? I didn't even notice the music until the second play-through with the director's commentary. To me, that's good music editing...when you don't even know it's there. (And yeah, the director did the music, too...on his computer!)\n\nThe movie's ending is confusing, and I still am not sure about some of the elements. When you're dealing with time-travel scenarios and messing with the future, you'll have that, I guess.\n\nIf you're the type of person that wants/needs everything spelled out for you, you may not like this film. If you need ""the point"" on a proverbial billboard, or want mile-a-minute MTV-like action, you may not like this film. But if you're fascinated by the idea of time travel and other scientific ""what ifs?"", you'll likely enjoy this cerebral movie. If you enjoy subtlety as is seen in movies such as Office Space, Pieces of April, Napoleon Dynamite, etc.-- as well as flicks that are compellingly character-driven--you'll likely love this movie. Those who appreciate the art of filmmaking will no doubt enjoy this movie as well...especially after you hear the director's commentary (and what went into making this film.) And contrary to what another reviewer said, not ALL shots were done in one take. This movie wasn't done slipshod and then sent off to Sundance. A lot of care went into this movie...with Shane and his co-star rehearsing one scene (a dialogue) for two months.\n\nI'm excited to see more from this filmmaker, writer, and actor. He is truly a talented guy...as is his main co-star and the other actors (one of which is also the cameraman).\n\nNote: the DVD said it was R rated for brief language, but I can't remember one curse word being uttered! Go figure.";Can't Wait To See More From This Filmmaker!
6;29.0;1.0;6.0;"The movie is very confusing.  At first one might think that some highly intellectual things are going on that one should think about, but in reality the script is a total disaster and makes very little sense.\n\nThe writer/director/star's description of how a time machine works is rather unique, though, and the least ""magical"" sounding/least impossible sounding of any story in the time travel genre.  I guess that's cool, but that part is easy to figure out. (Spoiler: device makes loop forward and backward in time from a fixed point that you can ride around on).  Neat idea, and better than the sort of go anywhere, anytime free-flowing concept in most other stories.\n\nThe disorderly plot, writer's skimming over key details, etc. are not cool.  You think that this is meant to challenge your intellect.  In reality, you realize it's just bad writing.  Bad, bad, bad.\n\nCase in point--the exposition of the ""critical"" event that the main characters are trying to influence.  They discuss it, but we have no idea what they are talking about until it happens.  It also completely tangential to the rest of the plot.  And and complete change in motivation for the characters.  What I believe happened is that the writer simply got bored with the story he was telling, or he realized that he had some extra time to spare, so he simply switched to a new story line in the last 15 minutes of the movie.  That is really, really poor work.\n\nThe time travelers do some ""stuff"" to play the stock market, but one of them talks about as if he is knowledgeable on the topic, but it's clear the writer has no idea how any of this works, and just has him BS his way through the scenes.  (Was there even a script at this point, or did he tell the actor to make up some smart, stock-markety-sounding stuff)?\n\nSpeaking of that, the techno-babble is nothing to marvel at.  It's just babble, like in any other sci-fi plot.\n\nI realize this was a very low-budget film, but considering the writer/director/lead was essentially pricing his labor for free, there is no excuse for his not working on making the writing better.  Maybe rehearsing the scenes a bit more (or at all?) would have revealed the problems.  Or, I don't know, storyboarding?  Really basic stuff.  It was clearly thrown together hastily, which is not the fault of the budget at all.\n\nIf you talk about this long enough and make all sorts of assumptions that effectively rewrite or supplement the story, you can make perfect sense of it.  I guess that's a fun game for some, so I can understand the movie's appeal in that regard.";Very Confusing Due to Poor Script
70;30.0;2.0;12.0;The actors in Primer seem inexperienced and unable to play much emotion. But that's not the problem with this movie.\n\nThe script is dense, and about 2/3 of the way through the film, it becomes almost impossible to understand exactly what is happening, and why. But that's not the problem with this movie.\n\nIf I did watch the requisite number of times needed to figure out the puzzle of what is actually happening in this film, it would not matter, because I do not care about what happens to any of these bland, directionless people. That is the problem with Primer.\n\nAfter finishing the film, I started to go through it again, this time listening to the director's commentary. As he described the rehearsals, how much of the sound had to be redubbed, how the film's only special effects shot was done on his home computer, I thought to myself, 'Even if he eventually does explain the plot to me, I really could care less!' So, I gave up, and saved mysefl the time.\n\nI like films that one can watch over and over again, catching new details and enjoying newly-noticed nuance. My Dinner With Andre would be an example of such a film. This movie is not worth watching once, except as a demonstration of what is technically possible on a low budget, filming with Super 16mm film, and editing with a computer. The technique is only worthwhile if you have characters who are worth knowing, and the characters in Primer are hardly more dimensional than the paper the script was printed on.\n\nI wasted a free Blockbuster movie rental on this obtuse excuse for drama. That's the saddest part of all.;Amazing for what it is, totally frustrating for what it is not!
71;31.0;5.0;12.0;This movie is incredible! I can't believe I hadn't heard about it until today when I saw it at the video store, rented it, and watched it. Shane Carruth is obviously a genius. Everything about this movie is perfect. Carruth wrote it, directed it, edited it, did the music, etc. Even the end credits are perfect as far as my opinion of graphic design. I cannot overstate the brilliance of this movie!;Mind-blowing Masterpiece of cinema!
79;32.0;1.0;12.0;Actor-producer-writer-director-composer Shane Carruth is certainly a one-man band. Too bad he can't play a tune. The film is totally inexplicable on a narrative level. It took quite a while until the premise was even set up-that the two lead characters had inadvertantly created a device that sends things back in time. I was only able to figure this out from their scheme to manipulate stocks or mutual funds to their advantage. That's also about the last thing in the film I could understand. The two talk about the time travel process creating doubles, but this didn't seem readily apparent to me nor was it explained. The film's plot doesn't work and aside from the plot it offers nothing else of merit. The actors are amateurs, the dialogue sounds like what might happen if William Burroughs' cut-up technique was applied to a technical manual and the film is visually uninteresting.\n\nEvery few years someone comes along with a film supposedly made on a shoestring budget and their triumph of entrepreneurship wows people. That seems to really be the story that people want to hear. The actual quality of the film itself is irrelevant. The success of Primer and the immense frustration it generated in this viewer means that I will now take these indie success stories and the accolades they win as a disrecommendation, alas.;Inexplicable
18;33.0;1.0;9.0;In the end, a movie has to be enjoyable and interesting, period!  Whether it is adventure, romance, comedy, fantasy or hard science fiction, the film has to hold your interest.  This film does not accomplish any of this for me.\n  In my youth and through most of my adult life I have enjoyed what is referred to as hard science fiction.  There is a wealth of literature in this genre but very few films that have been made using this formula.  Primer is one attempt, and I praise the filmmaker for it, but as a film is just does not stand up to the requirements of what a good film is in my opinion.  You can analyze the plot construction and the paradoxes the film raises but that is just an exercise that any conversation with someone with the same interests accomplishes.  Most of this film seems to be exactly that.  A film needs to be much more than intellectual discourse, no matter how intriguing the idea.\n  As many have pointed out the film is very hard to follow.  Even though it has a stylized look, (mainly due to its low budget), that look is very drab and boring.  I love films that are visually stunning and use symbolism and metaphors to tell their story.  Even if I didn't get it the first time I am compelled to watch the film again and again, each time gaining new insight into its secrets.  The process is exciting and interesting because of the look and style of the film and the emotions it provokes.  I guess I could watch this film over and over and start to unravel its story but I just have no desire to. I can watch a Bergman or Lynch film over and over and even if I come to no concrete conclusion I at least enjoy the experience.\n  Here is a list of hard sci fi films that I feel have been successful. I'd be interested if others might add to the list.  Forbidden Planet, The Andromeda Strain, Silent Running, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Terminator, Alien, Alens.  I'm still waiting for film adaptations of many of Arthur C. Clarks stories, especially Childhood's End.;Overblown praise for a poorly executed movie with a great premise

Just because you give someone a camera doesn't mean they are a filmmaker.  I am quite confused to as to how this film won something at Sundance.\n\n  I tried to give ""Primer"" the benefit of the doubt; I am all for independent gems succeeding.  I made it through about twenty minutes still thinking ""Ok, it's gonna get good any second.""  By the time the end credits rolled I was pissed off at the filmmakers and myself for not quitting the film a long time ago.\n\n  Do not waste your time on this film. The only reason to ever watch ""Primer"" is if you are in the film or know someone who is in the film.  Otherwise, you will not get it, and will have wasted your valuable time.  And no scientific box that you made in your garage will be enough time travel to get your life back.  Skip it.";Worst movie I have ever seen.  And that's being kind.
44;35.0;1.0;11.0;Primer is one of those films that starts off by unloading a ton of what can only be called irrelevant information on you. And just when you think you might get a break, it keeps right along doing so. This is a movie that is cheaply made. Fine. The real problem is it is not made for even intelligent moviegoers. This is a film for engineers and very smart engineers at that. I think this movie should come with a warning at the top that says so. I am angered after watching just half of this movie.\n\nI expect movies to do one of two things for me: entertain or enlighten (the great ones do both). Primer did neither. It was way too cheaply made to entertain -- although there are some small filming tricks like Aaron's wife's face being obscured in the first scene to add to the feeling that she is not important to our two lead characters at this time. The soundtrack isn't bad either -- and also the dialogue was way too fast and annoying to properly follow. While I know there are some movies you can't know every single thing that's going on without repeated viewings, this film was bloody ridiculous. I watch a lot of movies, everything from sci-fi (Aeon Flux) to Scottish Drama (Young Adam) (Dear Frankie) to Australian Drama/Action (Heaven's Burning) to French Drama (The Dreamlife of Angels) to the Harry Potter films. And yes I have also seen plenty of Sci-Fi which I have enjoyed (2001) (Species) to name a few. Yet the only two movies I have in recent memory as being so poor I had to literally stop watching was Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason and Fantastic 4. I can now add Primer to that small list. I literally had to shut off this DVD halfway through and insert one from my collection -- Gladiator. A real DVD! With (gasp) smart dialogue you can actually follow and (yikes!) a solid cast.\n\nI rarely write reviews, but I really feel compelled to write one in this case to warn others. If you want to waste your money, then go ahead and rent this movie. Otherwise, I strongly recommend something better like one of the films I've mentioned above. Cannes festival awards for Primer? My respect for these awards has diminished... Any chance I can get a refund at Blockbuster? No? Rats...;A waste of time/money
77;36.0;2.0;11.0;"The positives.  It's got a lot of low tech engineero-babble in it that actually sounds pretty good (I am one of their kind, and can speak their language).  With the exception of the weeble-coating slime-mold clue, it comes across as ""believable"". Very original and ballsey for a first time indy project, so a lot of credit is due, BUT, this movie fails in the fundamentals.\n\nDoesn't a movie owe it to a viewer to at least be understandable on some level during the first viewing? Isn't that a fundamental part of the movie art form, a reasonable expectation of a viewer? I don't mind a good head-fake ending, like Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects, or Fight Club. Even a thick plot like Heat, or Memento may take multiple viewings to fully appreciate all the connections, but all of those projects provide a payoff for the first time viewer.\n\nPrimer on the otherhand is just an excercize in manipulation. Too clever by half. Being intentionally indecipherable, it is inaccessable, and therefore not really art, and not really much of a movie. The techno babble, the lack of any warmth or arc or discernable motivations, the extraordinarally poor audio, all of it knee-caps this thing before it even starts to move.  The entire viewing experience is a let down.  I've seen it twice, but haven't gotten much in the way of genuine enjoyment out of it. And I also have to throw the flag on the Sundance award given to this movie.  I think it has to be an ""Emperor Has no Clothes"" type situation; a group of people who after a single viewing simply could not admit to each other that they couldn't understand an opaque storyline that ""appeared"" intellectually demanding.\n\nMabye Primer makes sense after multiple viewings.  Maybe.  I just know that it doesn't after two.  So, if you are looking to turn a 90 minute indy movie into a hobby requiring dozens of hours of time-line flow-charting that may or may not reveal anything, then this may be a great subject.  Unfortunately that's exactly what makes it a poor movie.\n\nIf you decide to watch it, turn your ""machine"" on before you start, you'll want to be able to get back out and stop yourself.";Intelligent, thought provoking, but not much of a movie.
81;37.0;5.0;11.0;I stumbled on Primer at the local video rental and made the mistake of watching it the first time late in the evening. Then I had to see it again right away to try to start understanding the bugger. And then again to confirm, and then again to hear the director's commentary, and again, and again ... Well, you get the idea. I went through it 6 times before I thought I knew which Abe was where when and how many Aarons we ended up with. My head is still spinning weeks later. And I've ordered my co-py so I can keep digging. A great movie and a really brilliant start to what I hope will be a long and fruitful career. On the shelf by Memento and 2001. Buy it now!;I think I get it - Oh...No I Don't
96;38.0;4.0;11.0;Although much has been made of the film's dense science concepts and the technobabble that permeates the script, Primer is first and foremost an examination of ethics and morality: If you discovered a means to acquire extreme wealth, to what degree would you betray your notions of humanity to achieve that end?  Would you sacrifice friendships and business relationships?  Some would and do.  Would you betray your family?  Would you kill yourself a little piece at a time -- or even all at once -- to make a profit?  Could using the same power/technology to do a good deed redeem these profit motive transgressions?  Ultimately, this movie is a cautionary tale about the pitfalls that lie at the intersection of technology and ethics, which is a recurring theme in science fiction...\n\nAs for the comments about the confusing nature of the narrative, this is a movie about messing with the space-time continuum.  Everything is SUPPOSED to be all cracked-out -- it's crucial to the movie.  By the end of Primer, even the characters are confused as to what is real and what is Memorex...\n\nPrimer features some gorgeous moments of digital film-making and believable, intriguing performances.  And, yeah -- you're going to have to pay attention, so leave the beer in the fridge for this one.  But you probably won't miss it (and since it's a relatively short film, you won't have to wait long anyway).;more about philosophy than technology...
14;39.0;5.0;7.0;I seldom review movies, but felt compelled to review this one. This movie is a special gem.\n\nI also seldom buy movies, but I bought this for myself and all my engineer/math/computer scientist friends. This movie is so subtle yet so insidious. And yes, I had to watch it at least 3 times before I began to fully realize how complex it was. Watching it is a recursive experience in itself. Each time something new is illuminated. I will not give away the content, but if you think there are only a couple timelines in here and only two people... you are missing most of the movie. There are many more levels, permutations, and acting parties, all embedded, so in effect you are watching the culmination of potentially an infinite number altered originals. In fact, the entire movie plot may just be one permutation among many alternates. The last minute of the movie made me rethink the entire premise once again and forced me to re-watch it again.... and just as before I walked away realizing that there was more to the story than before. (A sick part of me thinks this would be a great movie to give as a weird form of am IQ exam. To see which people can identify how many number of timelines in it after watching the movie only once... I would probably not fare too well)\n\nThe fact that the movie lacks almost all exposition (except for the brief phone message voice over) makes this a story you must watch with a clear head and an attention to detail. The details in the movie are everything. I would like to say that this rivals David Lynch, except that David Lynch has never made a coherent movie that was in fact logically flawless. There are no mistakes here, blatant contradictions, deus ex machina resolutions, or weird ambiguities for the sake of weirdness. This movie feels like it was written by either a mathematician or a logician. It is simply put, flawless in design and conception. A part of me is extremely jealous. I could go on about the low budget, the dedication of everyone involved in the production, but that would miss the entire point of this movie.\n\nRegardless of the production or anything related to it, the movie, on its own stands for as a the benchmark against which all other time-travel, multiverse, etc. movies will have to be judged against. It is one of my top 3 movies of all time. Inception was fun, but only had 3 or so plausible alternative explanations. This here has... well enough to make Godel chuckle. I defy anyone to tell me of another time travel movie that is more consistent in its recursive M.C. Escher-esque beauty.\n\nFor those who gave this movie 1 star, you probably didn't quite get something. I recommend you do any of the following (1) watch it again and realize you are watching a movie about recursive time travel, (2) read up about the concept of recursion, and (3) if you're still lost look up the detailed chart available online that shows all the timelines and how they are intertwined.;Probably the most logically consistent, coherent, and intelligent time-travel movie made to date
30;40.0;1.0;10.0;I do respect what they are trying to do in this movie, but it doesn't come to fruition in my opinion. It is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all, but I am not sure you will want to after the first viewing....I didn't. This is a movie that had great potential, but in my opinion it never reached it. You may disagree.\n\nI don't mind depth and intricacy in a movie plot, or even a little misdirection in order to keep it exciting (e.g. Sixth Sense), but I do mind confusion. And it was not just confusing, in the end, despite a nice attempt and maybe a few moments of drama, to me it was just plain boring. Alot of my boredom may just be attributable to the minimalist approach to this whole movie, nevertheless, it bored me. It relied to heavily on the story and the acting, neither of which were bad, but not nearly good enough to make up for the lack of visual interest in this movie.;Good try, but didn't do it for me

Because the MIND is engaged.\n\nSome of the reviews here are clearly from the snobbish, uppity, ""i went to film class so i KNOW what it means to produce a real film"" variety.\n\nIgnore these people.  Here's what you'll find in Primer:\n\nThe mother of all movie puzzles.  You'll have to watch this thing a couple of times.  If that bothers you for some egotistical reason, then don't watch it.

But, if you're determined to figure something out...watch and love!\n\nCoolest dialogue in history.  These guys sound like they're actually talking, not giving us one lined zingers from a script.  Granted, the dialogue gets techy...but that didn't bother me at all.  There are some gems hidden in the script if you already have a good understanding of techy-speak...but it's not important for you to grasp the puzzle.\n\nBest use of U-Haul in a movie.\n\nA fresh look at time travel and the effects it would have on friendship.\n\nPick this thing up and enjoy.\n\nps...did i mention it was made for a whopping $7000.00?!?!?";Loved it

The actors mumble their way through a bunch of techno-babble while rudely speaking over each other, and then come to the realization that as soon as you enter into a time machine you are forever locked into a loop.  Disjointed, predictable, ponderous.  Bla bla bla bla bla!  Go watch Back to the Future.  If you have not seen it, don't bother.

67;44.0;5.0;10.0;"Primer is easily the best science fiction film I've seen in a decade (if not longer).  I will not offer up explanations of what goes on in this movie, but generally speaking, it deals with young professionals and the concepts of time travel.\n\nPrimer is an innovative approach to science fiction in film that sci/fi has been missing.  Instead of spending tons of money on special effects, the effects are cerebral.  When this film offers up the inexplicable or the amazing, the explanations are suggested at and tantalizingly held just beyond our grasp.  This results in a very creepy feeling permeating the work.  The viewer is also left to figure complicated plot turns on their own, instead of being 'hit over the head' with explanations.\n\nShane Carruth would appear to you as a veteran film-maker based upon this work; the fact that it is his first film is almost unbelievable.\n\nI stayed up all night the evening I saw this movie for the first time.  Fortunately, I first saw it on DVD, so I was able to play it back several times to figure out what happened in the movie.

I also recommend checking out the Primer movie website after having viewed the film if you have any questions (which, I almost guarantee, you will).\n\nHighly recommended.";"Expertly done; Mind-blowing and Creepy (in a good way)"

""Primer"" is definitely not for all audiences, and, truth be told, it's pretty slow going stuff for a good portion of the film.  Nonetheless, my interest never flagged, but was rather piqued and curious more than being merely entertained.\n\nExtremely difficult to fully understand, I watched, at times uncertain of what I was hearing and pretty sure that all of this was over my head.  Slowly though, one realizes there are several points in ""Primer"" where things begin to click and make sense.  There was, for me, one particular point which can only be described as a truly ""Aha!"" moment . . . as my jaw hit the floor!\n\n""Primer"" is loaded with paradoxes and writer/director and star Shane Carruth clearly acknowledges these, yet even within these limitations - like time travel itself - we watch them expand and contract into permutations that, once understood, are horrifyingly unsettling.\n\nThis is a movie to watch repeatedly and I can see cults devoted to ""Primer.""  The movie was apparently made for almost nothing and its sets, costumes reflect that - beautifully:  Primer doesn't need them.  A suburban living room, garage, U-Haul storage bin, a borrowed lab, a parking lot and a motel room pretty much constitute every set for the film, yet by its end you'll feel as though having re-discovered the universe.\n\nCome along for the ride!";Primer = An Enigmatic Treasure Trove!

The script was solid, enticing, intriguing, and the actors delivered all of their lines (it seems) almost flawlessly. There were periods of overlapping dialogue, yes, but it was very natural and still intense.\n\nI don't know why people expect to have everything handed to them in a movie... I much prefer to have at least some unknown that requires some brainpower.

At the end all we felt was relief that it was over and no desire to understand everything that happened.;Sorry, not good
13;50.0;5.0;6.0;"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I am frustrated that it got relatively little attention.\n\nThere are several comments here about the budget, the dialogue, the confusing juxtaposition of the story-telling, etc.  I agree with many of the comments:  the dialogue & acting are quite good, but not stellar.  The dialogue is often so rampant that it's hard to follow much; this is true, but it is actually quite effective in showing how folks act when they think of & create something so cool that they cannot contain themselves.  Etc.\n\nBut the storyline and the manner in which it is told is so incredible, tight, and complex that it is mind-boggling.  For this alone, the movie deserves 5 stars, however, to reiterate above, the acting, etc. was better than decent.  It is true that you likely will not fully understand the movie after watching it just once.  If that irritates you, don't watch this.  However, if you enjoy having to think through a movie BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF THE MOVIE, there is nothing better.  I have read this movie is like Pi... perhaps, but it is so much better.  I can see the storytelling as resembling ""Momento"" (also one of my favorites), but again, it is so much better here in Primer.  I can also see it sharing a similar ""time-paradox"" aspect with 12 Monkeys, but here Primer also outshines it.\n\nThis movie uses ingenious storytelling and complex concepts to play upon a powerful theme:  would omnipotence make a person more kind, or more evil.  This movie plays with power & God complexes beyond those of being a spy, the president, or even a superhero.  Yet, somehow both the movie & the characters seem so much more simple, palpable, and touchable.  In my opinion, that just helps to bring more urgency to this matter of omnipotence, and how it corrupts.\n\nTo the budge point:  I am just so glad that absolutely awesome movies can still be made with a moderate budget.  This movie is proof that some of the best ideas will come from unexpected directions... and it's nice to know a movie can be made without knowing for certain whether it will make lots of money or not.";incredible concept, flawlessly told

Ultimately, I still wish I could truly go back in time -- and NOT see this horrendous excuse for a movie.  But let me tell you why:\n\nThe audio was beyond horrible,... it was confoundingly bad. All the background noise, cars passing by outside the house, and other stuff totally unrelated to the movie, were always louder than the dialogue.  But that was the GOOD news, inasmuch as the dialoge was much much WORSE than I could have believed possible.  This was without a doubt the longest and most unenjoyable 77 minutes I have endured in a very long time.\n\n(Sci-Fi lovers should watch ""Crimson Rivers"" a Jean Reno film I have reviewed on Amazon.  ""Event Horizon"" is another fine movie.  And if a 'time-travel' flick is the only thing that will satisfy you, save yourself and just pick any one other than this)\n\n ""Primer"" was not unlike sitting all day in a barbershop frequented entirely by very old retirees and listening to them rambling, ad nauseum, about nothing. At once having nothing to say, yet constantly and endlessly talking. Failing to hold to one banal theme from beginning to end of each boring and long-running sentence. Or in the rare instance of getting onto something seeming to be remotely of interest, forgetting halfway through the sentence what they'd been talking about in the first place and going on to something else.\n\nI died a thousand times during this movie, but sadly the folks who made it kept traveling back in time and reviving me so as to force me to go on!

In choosing to see Primer, my thought was, ""It might be good. Besides, how bad could it be?"" Let me tell you, for seventy seven minutes time nearly stood still, so that when finally I had reached the end and awakened from this horrific and painful nightmare, I felt I had aged about seventy seven DAYS.\n\nForget the death penalty. Take the worst criminals and strap them into a comfortable chair with their eyes taped open. Run an IV with chemicals to keep them awake forever.

For $7,000 -- if I understand correctly -- he's got an independent release that garnered him Independent Spirit Award nominations for Best Director & Best First Screenplay.  You want to cheer for the film because both Carruth and David Sullivan are nice looking leads who look as good in button-down shirts with ties as they do in their boxers crawling out of the big blue box.  Independent Spirit nominated blond David Sullivan for best debut performance.  Casey Gooden, Anand Upadhyaya & Carrie Crawford who round out the cast all have first time film credits.\n\nThe dynamic between the two leads is interesting as they consider the ethical considerations of issues at the same time they try to defraud the stock market.  What makes the family man Aaron played by Shane Carruth get on a plane and abandon his family came out of the blue for me and left me with contempt for the main character at the end of the film.\n\nThe cinema verite style of improvised-sounding dialogue and low-key emotions does grate on the viewer after awhile.

I agree with one professional reviewer that one of the greatest lines is, ""Are you hungry?  I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.""  I can usually follow the most complex plots, but did begin to fuzz in the last quarter of the film trying to keep up with just what they were trying to accomplish to keep the gunman from shooting at the party or why their beards had different growths.

I have watched this film probably at least 10 times.  And each time I started to get more of the subtle pieces of the story along with it's many nuances. I am not going to go into the whole storyline and plot of this film, because there are so many people who have arleady done that, and it would be redundant for me to do that. The film was made by an engineer who decided he wanted to make a film based on an interesting subject, but more subtle than anyone else that has attempted to make of this subject. So he decided to read a lot of books on film, pre-production, production and postproduction which really helped in the long run, eventually he made this film and ended up winning a award at sundance.

15;60.0;5.0;6.0;"A time travel story confronts the paradox: how can a traveler to the past avoid affecting the future in uncontrollable ways? ""Primer"" tackles the conundrum with compelling force, cerebral gymnastics and the python grip of inexorable logic.\n  The joke goes: What do they do with engineers who turn 40? They take them out and shoot them.\n  A quartet of engineers who work for a Dallas semiconductor company have decided to pool their talents in their spare time to develop an original invention, a break-through process or a patentable idea that will have commercial applications and deliver them from the dreary tedium of their work-driven lives before the promise of their most productive years slips away and consigns them to permanent disappointment.\n  They are not geniuses. ""Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated. Nothing extreme."" On their best days, they might be considered ""clever.""\n  In their off duty hours they work in long-sleeved shirts and ties. They conduct experiments on the cheap in a garage with borrowed equipment. They buy electronic components from Walmart. They cannibalize a microwave oven, a car, a refrigerator. Brimming with notions, they speak in elliptical sentences and argue briskly in the language of physics and electrical engineering.\n  ""They took from their surroundings what was needed and made of it something more.""\n  Abe and Aaron are the first to see sparks fly from their flints. After months of fruitless tries, they produce a field in an enclosed box that creates more energy than it uses. ""There was value in the thing."" They knew that. What might be its practical application? ""They were out of their depth."" They realize that ""the easiest way to get exploited was to sell something they did not yet understand."" They decide to cut out their partners.\n  More weeks of hit and miss experiments reveal a stunning fact: their box drew its energy from a continuous feedback loop that could return its contents to the past. They had built a time machine.\n  The next step is inevitable: they must test their device on themselves. They build a pair of coffin-sized boxes to generate their field. Aaron asks, ""What is your opinion on how safe this thing is?""\n  Abe shrugs, ""I can imagine no way in which this thing could be considered remotely close to safe.""\n  The device has its limits. It does not propel its occupants into the future. It can only return them to the moment at which it was activated. Abe and Aaron warm up the boxes for five days, enter them, and return to the past.\n  The practical application is obvious. The device grants them five days of prescience, enough certain knowledge of outcomes to reap fortunes from jackpot lottery numbers, sports wagers, and spectacularly performing market securities.\n  There are also complications. The past is exactly as they have left it and it includes them as they were before they traveled backward in time. They have become their own doubles.\n  They are alert to the peril of discovery by their doubles or by anybody who might detect them in two places at once, wives, relatives, friends, or their partners unaware of their invention. ""If we're playing with causality..."" Abe worries. They take themselves ""out of the equation"" by sequester in an out-of-town motel, disconnecting phones, television, radio - anything that might keep them connected electronically or emotionally to their personal world.\n  Leaving their doubles to continue replaying the crucial five days, Abe and Aaron repeat their trips back to the original moment of their machine's activation, returning each time with an accumulation of knowledge they can transform into exponential growth of bankable cash.\n  Their circuitous repetitions of time travel take a physical toll. Their ears bleed. Their hands lose the ability to fashion script. Their decision-making faculties lose focus. Aaron voices a fantasy of violent confrontation with an obnoxious superior, ""just to know what it feels like"", then explains that he would subsequently prevent himself from the act by intervening before it occurred. Abe reminds him that contact with their doubles must never happen. The consequences would be inconceivable. But ""The idea had been spoken. The words wouldn't go back after they had been uttered aloud.""\n  ""I'm not going to pretend I know about paradoxes."" Aaron admits. ""About the worst thing in the world is to know that the moment you're experiencing has already been plotted.""\n  In a moment of shocking clarity, as Aaron and Abe observe their doubles from afar, they realize that they have no way of knowing whether either of them, without the knowledge of the other, has already altered their past. Mistrust has introduced a variable into their equation. The permutations are terrifying.\n  ""What's worse,"" Aaron wonders, ""thinking you're being paranoid or knowing that you should be?""\n  Writer/director Shane Carruth, who also edited and stars in the film and composed its music and sound effects, is a one-man band, who produced ""Primer"" on an onion-skin budget, stocked the cast and crew with friends and family, and delivered a taut, intricate, visually arresting, intellectually stimulating gem. Crafting film virtue from raw necessity and quicksilver imagination, Carruth employs low-key realism in cost-conscious characters, tech-heavy dialog, taped-together props, and naturalistic lighting. With quickening pace, the narrative contours move from the familiar to the fantastic. It is a convincing fable of garage science yielding profound innovation with infinite implications.\n  ""They took from their surroundings what was needed and made of it something more.""

The more the two try and fix the mess they created the more of a mess they make and then attempt to stop themselves from doing what they did in the first place.

It is almost like staring at those weird 3D posters (big in the 90's, I think an Al Gore invention), that required you to look at them without really looking and before you knew it, ""bam!""

90;62.0;5.0;8.0;There exists a very small genre of movies...12 Monkeys, Memento, The Thing, Basic, Donnie Darko....that DEMAND repeated viewings.  These are movies that with one viewing, you have not enjoyed or understood the majority of the material.  Watching one of these movies is like uncovering a gold mine....you find that there is a wealth, a journey of information and thoughts that you have been invited to and have only just begun.\n\nPrimer is one of these movies.  I have only seen it once, which nearly makes me unqualified to review it.  I cannot say how well it all fits together yet.  I will say that it makes Memento seem simple at times and promises to keep me thinking for months if not years.\n\nHere's the real kicker: 1) Primer was made on a budget of $7000!  2) Every scene was filmed in one take!  3) All of the actors are complete unknown amateurs!\n\nYou would never guess that any of these three facts are true.  The acting is seamless, the cinematography is often noticeably (in an attention grabbing way) good, and while there aren't any special effects, nothing suggests that this is a low budget film.\n\nLike most of the movies I listed at the top, Primer is a movie best viewed without knowing ANYTHING about it.  It has a playful tone of discovery that will be blunted if you have too much knowledge of the plot.\n\nSome people have complained that the movie is largely emotionless.  For most of the movie, this is true.  However, the puzzle it creates is engrossing enough that I, for one, felt no lack of emotion.  In fact, the absence of swelling emotions made the film feel much more realistic at times, and I think that may have been the intent.\n\nIf you like any of the films I mentioned above, don't miss this one.  This isn't the type of movie that mainstream audiences like, so it will never get the recognition it deserves.

16;63.0;4.0;6.0;A small group of engineers spent their nights and weekends making this exciting and low key science fiction thriller about a small group of engineers who spend their nights and weekends trying to create something marketable, and create something far more exciting and dangerous than they could have anticipated.  With it, they open Pandora's box and a metaphysical can of worms.\n\nWhat I like the most about the film is what will likely turn some viewers off: its elliptical and condensed style and dialogue.  It is that these engineers speak like engineers.  They talk to each other as if they each actually know something, and they'd be impatient and annoyed if they were expected to repeat or explain themselves.  You could say they out-mamet David Mamet, by acting like what they are supposed to be, highly intelligent inventors (rather than like Hollywood movie stars pretending to be academics).  You are either in it and know what's going on, or you don't and if you don't don't bother asking.  So when one of them slows down and starts explaining, leading his partner through the process of figuring out just what it is their device does, you really have to pay attention.\n\nThis is the kind of film that the Sundance film festival - where I saw this first and where Primer won the Grand Jury Prize - was made to celebrate.  It is inventive and unsettling, thoughtful and provocative, and makes maximum use of a very low budget.  I can't believe they made this for seven grand and favors!  The sound design suffers a bit, but they create a very intriguing minimalist aesthetic with a unique and edgy look.  A very impressive film and one of the best science fiction films I've seen in the last decade.  Not for everyone, since you have to watch very closely and pay attention -- a very different concept for those who have grown accustomed to associating science fiction with CGI effects, fast paced action, and explosives.;"""You're talking about building a bigger one...""  - a subtle and inventive, low key, intellectual science fiction thriller"

I simply listened and pondered at the ""endless permutations"" that were possible.  I also knew that I would watch the film again immediately.  After doing so, I can safely say that Primer is a completely different film the second time through.  You begin to realize that not everything was as it seemed the first time.  It's a richly rewarding film upon repeated viewings and I didn't find this arduous but instead quite a pleasurable fact of the film.  Further, I really like the way the writer/director handles the subject of time travel.  It isn't hokey or comic book in its approach.  But I caution that this film is not for the lazy movie watcher.

83;66.0;4.0;7.0;A strange, creative little film, this.  One that manages to make visual the chaos of quantum physics in the form of human permutations of the disorder and bizarre combination of marvel and fear that confront the mind upon a moment of discovery of a new fact/concept. This is a film that should be viewed by an  audience prepared to engage those parts of the brain not usually readily accessible, but available cellules of new thought chambers that need and should be challenged if we are to continue to cope with a universe increasingly less understandable the more we study it.\n\nBeginning with the title, PRIMER, no insight is presented as to whether the meaning is 1) introductory text: a book that provides an introduction to a topic, or 2) as in  biochemistry: genetic material - a molecular substrate such as a DNA molecule needed in the polymerization reaction that produces another molecule structurally similar to the substrate.  That is the beginning hurdle.  But if the viewer stumbles on the easy bumps, then the remainder of the story will be impossible.  Instead it is recommended that this film be approached with a 'tabula rasa' and simply watch as four young men bent on inventing the next big 'thing' fall into discovery of what appears to be a device that involves time travel, both horizontal and vertical.  The characters (Shane Carruth, David Sullivan, Casey Gooden, and Anand Upadhyaya) resemble talking heads and it is the dissolution of this quartet into a duet that supplies the human-interest aspect of this science experiment.  First, discovery, then analytical permutations, and ultimately greed and the accompanying human foibles that are sparked by the new.\n\nThis is very obviously a low budget work of love by writer/director/actor/cinematographer/producer/musical scorer/editor Shane Carruth (yes, he does it all) with all of the other tasks being accomplished by the remaining members of the cast.  The idea of the film is good and the fellows pull it off well.  If the dialogue becomes annoyingly verbose and abstract and covered by a rather pompous voice-over commentator, just rest assured that much of it isn't decipherable because of the quality of the sound and the fact that everyone talks simultaneously.  And if at the end of the film you are left scratching your head as to what you have just seen, then try to quickly summarize quantum physics or the chaos theory or even something as simple as molecular biology!  It is not meant to be simple, it is meant to approximate the terror and joy of confrontation with the frontiers of science and examine how inventions dealing with the chaos theory are inexorably linked with human frailties.  At a budget of $7,000.  this film relies more of personal commitment on the part of the crew than on the need to create a blockbuster movie.  Exercise your mind - try it.

42;76.0;5.0;6.0;...and I'm not talking about time travel. I'm talking about the mega-million dollar crap churned out weekly by Hollywood, pandering to an unintelligent audience, and frankly perpetuating the cycle by never demanding more of them.\n\nPrimer was so slick, and so lo-fi, it was unsettling.  Completely convincing in all its facets.  I knew it was low-budget, but I recently read it was done for $7K, which is just amazing.\n\nLike Pi, this movie demands you focus your short attention span on it, and it will hit you like a hammer.  Smart, hard-driving dialogue which throws you a bone often enough to keep you following what these uber-geniuses are discussing, and make you feel like you are in on the secret.\n\nAn amazing movie...;Case study for what is possible...
49;77.0;4.0;6.0;"PRIMER is the kind of movie that rewards paying attention.  At 80 minutes it's the perfect movie to watch again and again for ""clues,"" though what goes on is pretty clear if you follow closely.";I think I got it
61;78.0;4.0;6.0;"The first time I watched it, the plot line was so complex, it was difficult to formulate a coherent opinion. I watched it second time with a fair minded friend, and it was a lot easier to understand after a lengthy discussion. First thing first...if you're sort of a person who likes to be told every single detail in a movie, this probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you like brain teasers, puzzles, and likes to solve little nuances of a movie, this is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nThe plot line is simple: two engineers try to make a levitating machine (they call it ""diamagnetic"")in their garage, and actually succeed in doing it. The machine however has a special side-effect; any object that enters the machine can travel back in time. This is far different than a ""time machine"" because it only works one way, travel back in time, not forward. Carruth provides a very elegant and yet simple explanation of how the machine is able to achieve such a feat, but I won't go into that. The two engineers initially use this machine to make money off of the stock-market. But, as all time travel story goes, the frailties of humanity comes into the play that changes the lives of the two engineers. I won't give away the plot line, but it is definitely worth watching multiple times to fully understand the complex question that the film is proposing, such as cause and effect and time travel paradox.";Not for idiots
64;79.0;3.0;6.0;"This was a great and yet flawed movie. Great because, although made on an unbelievably small budget, it was well put together and made you think and pay attention, and flawed because it demanded an inordinate amount of analysis during the watching. I adore complex story lines with complicated presentations (read: Momento, Donnie Darko, etc.), and Primer would have made an excellent book, as I could page back as needed to keep the story straight in my head. However, because I really dislike stopping a movie so I can figure out what just happened, I had to content myself with ""kinda"" knowing after the first run-through, which is unsatisfying at best.  Although I don't care for big blockbuster movies that are geared to the lowest common denominator, I also prefer a movie not to require me to be a fantastically brilliant intellectual in order to leave the theater satisfied.  Nevertheless, I'm very glad I watched it (and I imagine I will watch it again for further illumination), I respect the movie and see a great future for Shane Carruth.";Wonderful and yet flawed . . .
78;80.0;2.0;6.0;I've watched the film and will probably do so again but one of the main problems with trying to understand this thing is that the full dialogue never seems to be shared with the audience.  Each of the characters seems to know the other so well, that they break in to answer before the other finishes.  It is obvious that they know what was going to be said but the rest of us are left in the dark.\n\nI understood about the time machine and all but shortly after their first manipulation of the stock market it just totally lost me.  I read here that there is suppose to be a third party who knows about the machine but I never did figure out who that was or that there even was a third party.  You could never figure out what each of the 2 main characters was trying to do.\n\nThere was something about a party with a guy and a shotgun but what about it??  It was mentioned earlier by the other 2 engineers that shared the garage with the main characters but they never even said what happened with the guy with the shotgun, so it was never clear why trying to do something about it was necessary.\n\nI've watched plenty of confusing movies but this one takes the cake for total disregard of the audience.  People don't mind convoluted plot twist and turns but you've got to tie it up eventually for the audience and this film failed miserably to do that.\n\nI'll watch it again but if this is the confused sort of thing that Sundance thinks is so good, I'd avoid anything like the plague that they put their stamp of approval on.  I gave it 2 stars because of the premise and the fact that you could believe that a previously unknown phenomena could be stumbled upon and made to work with a rather simple device.  If we were rating it for how much confusion it generates, then 5 would be appropriate.;If only the dialogue actually allowed you to understand
80;81.0;1.0;6.0;No doubt this film will have it's die hard followers, but I think the average viewer will find it boring, tedious and confusing. I had to make a real effort to watch it the whole way through and felt utterly unrewarded.;Boring, tedious & confusing.
82;82.0;5.0;6.0;"Okay, if this were a Hollywood flick, I wouldn't be giving it 5 stars.  Although it is an intriguing time-travel movie, it isn't an overtly dramatic film, and it's dialogue heavy in a way that doesn't really reveal (or differentiate) character or create plot momentum; there is a LOT of technical talk, and often talk substitutes for dramatic action.\n\nStill, what this filmmaker managed to do on a miniscule budget is amazing. It IS a good story, and original story. And the commentary was for me as interesting as the movie itself.  Carruth not only wrote, produced, directed, and acted in the film, he did the over-dubbing and special effects--effects done with a camcorder and his home pc.  Weebles figure significantly in the movie--these he picked up on E-bay. Photographs used in the movie were Photoshopped and sent to an online developer for printing.\n\nI think any aspiring filmmaker would love this movie if for no other reason than to watch the commentary, and learn how Carruth problem-solved without a vast budget and a huge staff of underlings.\n\nAn interesting piece of work.  But you have to pay attention.";Worth a Look--Especially the Commentary
20;83.0;4.0;5.0;"This movie really isn't a movie... it really doesn't work as a satire... but it truly is a great experience.  At its core it really is.... a primer.  It's a glance at the what/how/whys of the discovery of time travel.  All the elements are there.  And it is truly intended to give you no answers (after all... it's not called ""Conclusions"").\n\nMy first viewing of Primer was on IFC, and I started watching it 15 minutes into it.  I ended that viewing angry above all else.  I decided there must have been something I missed in that first 15 minutes that ties it all together.\n\nSo I watched it again, in its entirety.  And then I began to understand.\n\nPrimer goes through the process of discovery... what can be considered a REAL scientific discovery.  Which is actually not convenient to a movie format.  But they do it, and leave it raw, with the crosstalk, tedious explanations, and egotistical posturing that goes along with any engineer who thinks they're right (believe me... it happens).\n\nThen after discovery, it delves into the human condition.  Wanting to exploit it for profit, then considering the moral implications, then devolving into the selfishness of trying to play god.\n\nAnd the way it is filmed, as things progress, there are intentional gaps as timelines become more blurred and disconnected.  This makes Primer incredibly original, and great fun to play with the possibilities.\n\nIt truly stimulates the mind, and gives you something to walk away with and think about for days after viewing.  THIS is a measure of a great film.  And when you think about the spirit of the film, its budget constraints, it makes Primer a must see.\n\nIf you are an engineer, or know engineers, you owe it to yourself, or them, to see Primer.";Written about engineers... for engineers... by engineers
22;84.0;3.0;5.0;"Impressive debut, but for a rare, select audience. But it easily made my personal Best 20 Sci-Fi films of all time list. It won the annual Sundance award (over ""Garden State""), and is a 70-minute time travel movie that will blow your mind with the possibilities. It's written (and acted) by a methodical, analytical engineer type, so it's uncommonly smart: This is more ""Scientific American"" than ""Twilight Zone"". Best of all, the dialogue, film style, and feel of it has this realism to it that few tech films have ever captured. The engineer inventors never talk down to the audience; instead, the viewer is an eavesdropper and races to keep up with their techno-talk. The time travel ideas are so intricate that they have spawned web sites and forum discussions of their own (it takes repeated viewings to figure out what actually happened, but unlike ""Donnie Darko"", it does indeed make sense). But it's certainly more demanding (and slow) than standard time travel dramas. So, don't expect to really ""enjoy"" the movie until you watch it the second time.";Uncommonly Smart
28;85.0;5.0;5.0;one of the most interesting films I have seen in years, its one of those movies that you will have to watch a few times to actually understand.\n\nI just caught it for the 1st time on showtime and was so blown away that I just bought it on Amazon. To think that a bunch of techies with no formal film training could produce a film of this calibre foe seven grand is just unbelievable.;Totally engrossing
35;86.0;5.0;5.0;"For the first 40-45 minutes of this film, my mouth was continuously agape at the things the two engineers discovered as they built their time machine.\n\nFor the rest of the film, I was completely bewildered.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films to come out so far in 2000.  And what made it good was that it wasn't a big-budget movie.  With almost zero special effects (I think the scene with the cellphone call toward the end is an effect), the director nonetheless conveys everything we need to know.  Had this film been produced by, say, Jerry Bruckheimer or someone of his ilk, there would've been countless CG shots of people moving through time, trails running behind them, and at the end, a big fight with explosions.\n\nAlso, the homebrewed soundtrack provides the right amount of tension at the right times.  As an audio person, I know how important sound is to a film.  The wrong music can completely ruin things.  For example:  in ""The Incredibles"", after the plane gets blown up and mom makes a boat to carry Violet while Dash propels it -- that music is light enough to say ""see, we can get out of anything"".  But had it been done in a darker tone, we would've been scared out of our wits that everyone was going to die, even in an animated Disney/Pixar film.  The same thing here:  a sweeping orchestrated soundtrack could not have conveyed the feelings that simple piano tracks evoked.\n\nI still don't understand the ending.  But that's part of what makes it good.  I've seen it compared to ""Pi"", but at least in this one no one takes a power drill to anyone's head.";Almost like two separate films
45;87.0;3.0;5.0;Software engineer-turned-film director Shane Carruth shows one brilliant idea in `Primer': What if you can go back to yesterday, or any time in the past, using a time machine? Usually in the films based on time-traveling idea such as `Back to the Future' series, the time travelers (who go back to the past) do not meet themselves while staying in the past (themselves before time-traveling), and in this way the filmmakers avoid the confusing storytelling process that must follow the consequences of, say, Marty A meeting Marty B. What would happen if Marty in `BTTF' Part 1 looks up, and finds himself Marty in `BTTF' Part 2 looking down at him? Is it possible? If possible, how can you show it on screen, inevitable results affecting the entire series?\n\n`Primer' does this brave thing. The low-budget is basically about two young engineers Aaron and Abe who invented a time machine in their small garage. Instead of selling the license of techniques to major company (which I would love to do in their place), Abe and Aaron decide to conceal their invention from the public, and use it to make money. The idea is simple: investment in stock market. Get the right information about the market today, travel back to yesterday, and buy the right ones in the market.\n\nBut this method inevitably produces (sort of) TWO Aarons and TWO Abes at the same time. It produces `doubles' or `alternatives' of Aaron and Abe. Now here is a question. What if one of the `doubles' starts to act on his own? What if the double gets another `double' using the machine while the original is unaware of his move?\n\nThe premise sounds incredible, but very intriguing. But for all its fantastic concept, Shane Carruth made one mistake in making the film, and that is the script. To follow what is going on, we need a detailed chart of Abe and Aaron written by someone who can explain all the moves of the two characters, including their `doubles.' One viewing of the film is not enough, perhaps merely allowing you understand the 30 per cent of the story, and that is what happened to me. Now I read the many comments on the net, and that finally became 70 per cent. You might say you have to see the film at least five times. Yes, you are right. But why not make it `three times' or less?\n\n`The Primer' uses frequently high-tech jargons, which are slightly off-putting, but that is not a big problem. The film's production designs are frankly amateurish, and the time machine looks like a small box made of brown cardboard, but I can happily ignore those things. But I certainly didn't like sitting as a totally bemused audience in the dark, trying to think, `Is this my fault or not?'\n\nI like the film's bleak outlook on the idea of time traveling, and its challenging attitudes to make us think. Shane Carruth has succeeded in doing the latter, I think, for many viewers, including me, still find the mind-bending puzzle very intriguing after watching it. But the puzzle (which is an intelligent one, I admit) could have been better and more refined with more skillful presentation.;Dazzling Time Traveling Thriller: Very Intelligent and Very Confusing
46;88.0;3.0;5.0;This movie suffers from lame soundtrack, less than optimal audio during some dialogue and very dry and sterile overall rendition of the concept. I really like the idea of the chaotic time travel paradoxes it portrait, but it does so in an unecessary and overwhelming confusing way. The soundtrack does not build up the moment at any point during the movie and the dialogue did not need to be so technical. I still find this movie captivating in a strange way, I just wished that it was a little more polished. Overall: DECENT!;Original but it could have been better!

56;92.0;3.0;5.0;"Primer (Shane Carruth, 2004)\n\nThere are, in general, two kinds of movies. There's the kind that spells everything out, either loading you up with information throughout the narrative or giving you everything at the end, like one of Agatha Christie's detectives in the drawing room, pipe in hand, laying out the criminal's activities for interested guests of the recently departed. The other kind of movie gives you just enough, and makes you work for the rest. I vastly prefer the second type of film.\n\nPrimer attempts to be the kind of movie that gives you just enough and has you make the rest of the connections in your head, but it falls short in a few places. Shot for just $7,000 (the same budget Robert Rodriguez had for El Mariachi; I've no idea if that will end up meaning anything, but look where Rodriguez is now), it's probably possible to forgive Primer a few of its various shortcomings; after all, with seven grand, you're not going to have a lot of technical wizardry to play with. (One is tempted to draw parallels between the filmmaker shooting for seven grand and the character played by the filmmaker, an inventor who's constantly out of money. One will resist.) What's not forgivable for seven grand are the movie's two main failings. The first is that the script could have used another draft or two; the second is that, as I mentioned before, there are a few places in the movie where we could have been given more detail, enough for us to figure it all out. (I know I'm not alone in not being able to grasp it; I read reviews as well as write them.)\n\nThe movie revolves around four guys, Aaron, Abe, Robert, and Philip, who by day are drones in corporate America, and by night are fledgling inventors. They've been fledgling inventors forever; they develop a lot of products that are great for niche markets, but have yet to come up with anything that will allow them to quit their jobs and live in the lap of luxury, etc. Then Abe comes up with a machine capable of allowing time travel, and he and Aaron start experimenting.\n\n""Ah,"" you say, ""but what happened to Robert and Philip?"" That's the rub. They are conveniently written out of the script during the middle third of the movie (Aaron and Abe bar their access to the garage where the four work by telling them that it's being sprayed for bugs and no one's allowed in), only popping back in at the end for a bit in order to remind the viewer that the director hasn't forgotten about them altogether. Also, Abe and Aaron's significant others appear only when a question needs asked or some seemingly-innocuous tidbit (read: foreshadowing) needs added to the mix. The convenience factor of minor characters is something that has always bugged me; your mileage may vary.\n\nAs for not quite getting enough, it seems as if the film goes in jags on how it delivers this. During the first part of the movie, when we have more than Aaron and Abe in almost every scene, we get a realistic, but very confusing, depiction of four geeks inventing something-- everyone's talking all at once, and the viewer will never be able to follow it. Even the subtitler, who did a patchy job at best anyway, just gives up most of the time in scenes with simultaneous speech; there are, simply, no subtitles to be had there. (This is one of those films that you need to watch in English with English subtitles, so you can marvel at how things get lost in translation even when it's the same language in two different media.) As the film progresses, we can actually hear the characters well enough, but things start to get more complex. Actually, ""start"" isn't really a good word to use there; things begin complex, and get more so. I know graduate students who can't make heads or tails of the movie's final quarter-hour. The rest of us... well, we just have to wing it.\n\nIt's worth a rental, but prepare yourself. ** ";Could've used a touch more explication.
58;93.0;5.0;5.0;Wow, what can I say.  Definitely a movie my girlfriend and I will be watching over and over.  Very gripping, tense, and complex.  Still trying to figure out some of it.  I can't wait to watch it again, this time with the commentary track.;Mindbending
60;94.0;2.0;5.0;As such, I'm sure it will have a loving audience within that fanbase, but outside of that I'm sure it will have no impact.  Have you ever wondered while watching a Hollywood sci-fi, hi-tech thriller that if the film were actually as intelligent as it was pretending to be, it would actually present science that was coherent and interesting. Well, the actual result is almost as bad, but not entirely because of the writing.  The film fails because: 1) Non professional actors were used and the performances are pretty lifeless and 2)The writer/director hadn't really grasped the notion of dramatic action and how to portray that beyond the page. As a result, the film fails to draw the audience into its predicament.  Towards the end thing started to get somewhat interesting in terms of actual plot development, but to no avail.  It's as if the director sought to create a factual film while not caring about how he felt about the facts.  Films are a very emotional and sensoral medium which is why going to see them in a theatre is such a privelige, but seeing this one in a theatre would be just as entertaining as seeing it at home. While I applaud the effort of the team that made this film, I believe they failed in a large way and succeeded in a very small one.  As such, I recommend it to engineers, and not too many others.;A sci-fi thriller, written by an engineer

84;97.0;5.0;5.0;"The question I'd ask viewers who've watched Primer is ""How far in did you make it before clarity began to break down?"" Perhaps this is what motivates so many to go back for repeated viewings, hoping to break their own comprehension threshold. So where am I at with ""Primer?"" I've watched it twice and I keep thinking of Jeffrey Goldblum's character, the ""Chaotician,"" in the Jurassic Park movies. A guy like that would have a field day with ""Primer,"" and I'm even willing to bet that Carruth may have had a thought or two about Jurassic Park, among other sources, while putting Primer together. Here's a key: really, isn't ""Primer"" about the introduction of entropy - chaos - into the time travel narrative? Or, put another way, just because you set up some rules doesn't mean your doppleganger will follow them. All confusion aside, Carruth has found a novel format to pose an age-old question: How well do we really know ourselves?";The Psyche of Chaos, the Chaos of the Psyche
86;98.0;5.0;5.0;"Primer is a metaphor for the value of a great premise over the buck.  The film was made on a shoestring . . . for far less than Closer or The Day After Tomorrow(sorry I couldn't resist the left hook to Hollywood's schlock conveyor belt).\n\nPart of its appeal is the film does not show(or tell) what exactly is happening.  The story draws us in as we guess what is happening-and when!  But, how could the film explain how time travel works?  The time travelers themselves cannot fully explain what they discovered.  Their staccato dialogue about mathematics and physics serves the film well.  Myth, bubbling under the surface, involves quantum mechanics; an object's position in time and space can only be assigned a probability . . . not a certainty.\n\nThe excitement is not the wild ride of time travel and its effect on the world, but how a discovery rips apart a deep friendship.\n\nIf you are in the market for an engaging sci-fi fantasy trip, this is your flick.";Quantum mechanics as myth.

0;100.0;5.0;5.0;I saw this film last night at a special screening. It's mindboggling, but thoroughly enjoyable. It's probably best enjoyed if you have a background in science or engineering, but I think that's more a of a cultural background than a plot essential.\n\nI'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum. The story concerns the friendship of two young engineers (Abe and Aaron) living your average suburban life. In their spare time, they dream of creating the next big thing in Aaron's garage. They eventually stumble on to something of immense possibilities, but are unsure of what to do with it. As they begin to exploit the possibilities of their new invention, a rift begins to develop in their friendship.\n\nThis film will probably require multiple viewings to figure out exacly what's going on. Many people thought that they ending was bizarre, but it does follow logically if you pick up the clues. The strength of this film is in the two main characters. It's a character-driven plot that happens to be set in a science-fiction story. However, the science is an important part of the film as well. The sci-fi bit is one that's been covered in numerous films and books, but Primer covers it more carefully than any other story I've seen. The science in the film is vague enough to be plausible, which is how sci-fi should be. Too many movies go over the top in their explanations, leaving those in the audience with a technical background laughing out loud.;Excellent Film! Should be required for prospective engineers

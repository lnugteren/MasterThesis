40;1.0;5.0;1019.0;"I've tried many Orthopedic pillows since my neck was injured in a car accident over a year ago, but this is the first one to fully deliver on its claims. My pain has decreased by about 80% since I started using this pillow. I have not experienced this with any of the other neck rolls or orthopedic pillows that I have tried. As an aside, I also purchased an inversion table and I use that in addition to this pillow. On the days when I still have pain, I use the inversion table for traction and the pain relief is usually instantaneous. As other reviewers have noted, this pillow was not comfortable for the first few days. Lots of pressure on the base of my skull and on my ears from the ""lobes"" would cause those areas to be a bit sore in the morning. However, my intense neck pain was so significantly alleviated that I decided to stick with it to see if my body would adapt to the pillow. After about a week, the ""pressure"" issues disappeared and the neck relief benefits remained. I've been using the pillow for about a month and recently purchased one for my husband as well.\n\nUpdate! We have now had these pillows for several months and still love them! We are side *and* back sleepers and find this pillow very comfortable for both. When side-sleeping, we roll onto the side lobes which are firm enough to keep our heads well supported and in good alignment, yet not too firm as to be uncomfortable. When back sleeping, we just roll back to the middle pocket.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope this review is helpful!";Neck injury pain relief (this pillow and an inversion table)
19;2.0;4.0;503.0;"Let me guess, a bad neck while sleeping probably brought you here.  Me too.  Yep, some weeks back I woke up with a painful surprise in my neck.  It isn't the first time it has happened.  Usually, I will just deal with it and over time, maybe a few days, everything will work itself out and I am back to normal again.  This most recent neck ache would not go away however.  I would even wake up at night and find my neck contorted in such a way that I was just making things even worse.  There would be no self healing if I couldn't put my head in a position that would allow it to heal.  So, like many of you are probably doing, I went on a quest to find the holy grail of pillows.  If you have arrived at the end of your journey...or if you are just beginning, I'll tell you that there are many pillows out there and all of them claim something magical by resting your weary head on them.  You wouldn't believe how complicated pillow shopping is.  I can tell you that no review will help you find the right one.  I guess the reason we have so many different pillows out there is because everyone is so different and finicky when it comes to a product like this.  There are pillows that will cost you hundreds of dollars, some are filled with water and some with bamboo.  There are thin ones, fat ones, misshaped ones, feather ones, cotton ones, memory foam and NASA probably has one filled with cloud vapors.  The problem is that you are going to have to try them for yourself and find whats best for you.\n\nBeing a side and stomach sleeper, I started my quest by narrowing down the search to pillows that claimed support for someone like me.  I tried the ""wavy mountain memory foam pillow"" (that is not the products name...I don't remember what it is called) that cradles your head and I also tried a flat pillow.  Neither one seemed to help.  Looking on Amazon, I stumbled across this one and was intrigued by it's design.  It was definitely something that I had never tried before.  The good thing is that it wasn't too expensive and I was getting desperate.  I tried to find this particular pillows in some of the big box stores to at least put my hands on it but I could not find anything like it anywhere.  So, I guess I was destined to gamble with this thing.\n\nUpon arrival, I inspected the quality of the pillow and was pleased with that.  The stitching was well done, it was clean, and I didn't notice any horrible smell.  I wouldn't say this pillow is ""soft"".  Other pillows that I purchased throughout my journey, had a feeling of sinking right down into them and some were like rocks.  This one is firm and it's innards has that stuffing that you find in craft stores.  It feels and looks like that poly-fil fiber.  I found some of it stuck to the pillow fabric when I removed it from it's plastic bag and I can also see it through the white material that holds it all together.  The garment tag also states that it is made out of 100% Polyester Fiber.  Anyway...if it works...I don't care if it is made out of seaweed...I'll try it!  Trying it out for the first time was a little odd.  I tried the ""Larger Neck Support"" side and turned it around to try the ""Smaller Neck Support"" side.  The larger neck side actually seems softer allowing your neck to sink down nearly level with the ""hole"" area.  This also enables the lower areas of the pillow to support the sides of your neck a bit more.  I decided to use this approach as it seemed more comfortable to me.  I also noticed that when I am sleeping on my side that if I angle the pillow a bit that this helps me achieve a more comfortable position as well.  I am trying to avoid sleeping on my stomach because I think that is where a lot of my problems are coming from.  I've been using the pillow for a few weeks now and although I cannot say that I am completely healed, I am doing better.  I can now turn my head to back the car out of the driveway a lot more comfortably!  So is it the pillow or me being a bit more conscientious of how I am sleeping?  Who knows, maybe a combination of both.  I found this pillow to be comfortable for me to sleep on.  The ""hole"" area allows my head to rest down and my neck appears to level out when using it.  I do angle it a bit for comfort.\n\nWell, that is my adventure.  There are probably better ones out there but honestly I can't afford to try them all.  This one was more unique than some of the ones that I tried and it seemed to be what I needed.  Waking up in the middle of the night, with massive neck pain, and noticing the positions that I was putting my neck in gave me the idea that I needed something to sink my head and help hold my neck in place.  Of course, when we are sleeping, some of us toss around quite a bit and we are never truly ""settled"" into one place all night.  I can tell you that I am waking up a lot less at night and after a few weeks of use, my neck feels a whole lot better.  I can't say that I'd recommend this pillow...because we are all different sleepers...but I can say that it worked for me.";Have finally ended your quest for the perfect pillow?
13;3.0;4.0;384.0;"After a 6-day raging tension headache, I took the advice of my doctor and started searching for a pillow with neck support. This one made a lot of big claims, and reviews seemed mostly positive, so I went for it.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was disappointed. It felt way too hard, and not at all like it would be comfortable. I rushed to the bedroom so I could lay down on it, and decided it wasn't what I had hoped for and was going to send it back. Boyfriend steps in with the whole ""don't knock it till you try it"" thing, and I agree to give it a week. Very glad I gave it a try.\n\nA few positive notes:\n\n1. Yes, it's firm. They don't mess around when they call it a firm, full-support pillow. As it turns out, that's part of why I love it! Soft pillows (and even ""firm"" ones) that I've had in the past usually last me no longer than a month, as my fat head is really spectacular at wearing pillows down to nothing. I have some real faith in the durability of this pillow, even after just the first couple of nights.\n\n2. Yes, it's large. They don't make that claim lightly either. I would say I have a normal to slightly larger than normal head. There is AMPLE space for it in the indented region of the pillow with some movement to either side befor running into the side-sleeper edges. Attached photos show pillow with remote as well as monstrously large 17 lb. cat for size reference.\n\n3. As a multi-faceted sleeper who could go pro in tossing and turning or creative sleeping positions, I find that this pillow is equal parts supportive and flexible (flexible more so in the sense that it gives you the freedom to sleep comfortably in a variety of ways, not so much the nature of the pillow itself) for many kinds of sleepers, from back, to stomach, to side, and anywhere between. My headaches are now few and far between, and I've discovered that my neck actually DOES have range of motion after all! Who knew?!\n\nAnd of course, a few qualms:\n\n1. Mine, as a few others have noted, had a slight off putting smell to it when it arrived. I have a pretty keen olfactory sense, and the smell of mine was light enough that I could be lazy and go right to sleep on it without any cleaning the first night without any issues. Didn't even notice the smell after that. My guess is that airing out was good enough, or that perhaps it was the plastic bag that smelled. Who knows. I'm not too concerned.\n\n2. Definitely not love at first sight, and that's why I've rated it four stars instead of five. If boyfriend hadn't made me keep it, I would have sent it back without a second thought. No, it's not going to be the perfect pillow for everyone, but for some it will probably be pretty stellar if you get as far as trying it out for a week. Don't give up on it based on your ""fresh out of the box"" impressions.\n\nHope that helps clarify some of the common concerns.";I'll admit I was skeptical...
2;4.0;1.0;16.0;"I used to give this pillow 5 stars; I loved it! It was the first and only pillow I've ever tried that kept the severe pain and headaches from my Arnold-Chiari Malformation at bay. I'd always buy the same mind - full size firm. I've used them for over 6 years. Last year I started to notice that the pillows were going flatter faster and faster. One pillow used to last me a year. Then it became 9 months. Then 6 months. My most recent pillow only lasted 3! I should have returned it right away; it arrived all unevenly sewn, all sides of the pillow were at awkward angles. I just bought a new one and guess what? First, it arrived with a weird dark patch on it. Not a stain, because the fabric was fine. Rather, there's something really dark in about a 7"" streak inside the pillow. I was so tired I just slipped it in a pillowcase and fell asleep. Cannot believe I did that with who-knows-what inside the pillow. But that pillow couldn't even hold its shape for a single night! The following morning it was flatter than my two older pillows combined.\nSuffice it to say, I'm really disappointed. I counted on this pillow! I'm back to waking up with headaches and have no idea what to do now. I can tell you, though, I don't think I'll be buying another one. And that's truly disappointing!";Used to be 5-Stars, Before Quality Bottomed Out
41;5.0;5.0;278.0;"I purchased one of these tri-core pillows with a great deal of skepticism but out of desperation to help my neck pain. I had tried various sleeping positions, tried different ""regular"" pillows of varying softness, tried long neck and shoulder stretches, and tried some basic exercises and weight training specifically for the neck and shoulder muscles. My neck's range of motion was limited to about 45 in either direction and I felt sharp twinges it I tried to extend further. This affected many day-to-day activities, but most of all it made driving difficult, as looking over my shoulders became an exercise in twisting my upper body and shoulders to be able to look far enough.\n\nWhen the pillow arrived, it had a foul chemical odor, but washing it by hand with regular clothing detergent eliminated any bad smells. I had to let the pillow dry for a full two days, and afterwards I put it to proper use. The very first night, I slept on my back for the first time in as many months as I could remember. My neck and back pain had meant I could only comfortably sleep on my side or belly, but this pillow immediately relieved enough pain for a full night's rest on my back. I soon alternated sleeping on my sides, but it's worth noting that you have to shift the pillow slightly off-center for proper head and neck support when sleeping on your side.\n\nAfter about a week or two with my new pillow, my neck pain had faded away and my range of motion had been restored. I was amazed that a simple change in sleep support like this could have such a dramatic effect on me and my health. I've been using this pillow for several months now and, after borrowing it a few times, my wife said she loved it and we bought one for her too. By far this has been the best low-cost investment in our long-term health and I would strongly recommend it to anyone else with neck, shoulder, and back pain.";Wonderful pillow, relieved neck pain
18;6.0;5.0;124.0;I have severe problems with my cervical vertebrae. I have constant neck pain, and usually wake up with a headache. I've tried numerous pillows, from memory foam, to contoured, cervical rolls, $75 pillows, nothing helped for more than a few weeks. This pillow provided relief of my neck pain and headaches within a week. I'm a side/stomach sleeper (trying to stop sleeping on my stomach since it's terrible for my neck) but this pillow is comfortable either way. I sleep with this pillow every night and take it with me when I travel. It has been a miracle.\n\nI purchased my first pillow on July 22nd, 2015 and I just purchased a second pillow (Dec 10th, 2015) after my pain returned I've included a photograph of my new pillow (right) and my old pillow from July (left). I'm very rough on my pillows since I toss and turn a lot, and I clutch my pillow when I sleep. Although this pillow only lasted me about 4 months, I'm fully committed to purchasing a new one every four months as it has provided immense relief of what used to be an everyday pain.;Miracle Pillow - but it wore out quickly.
4;7.0;1.0;56.0;"I suffer from neck pain and bought this pillow in hopes of getting a decent night's rest for the first time in months. After trying out different pillows, I was optimistic that this one would help. Unfortunately, the search continues... Being a mostly side (and ocasional back) sleeper, I found it very hard balancing on either side of the pillow because it is very firm and my head would slip into the middle, putting my neck at an awkward angle. In short, I could not figure out how to make this work for me and my neck felt WORSE. Initially, I wondered if I had purchased the wrong size, and being desperate for a solution to my neck pain, I re-ordered the mid-core (gentle) as well as the petite core. Both did not work either and it ended up being an extremely expensive and futile exercise. To make things worse, the seller Pro Med Express does not accept any returns, because the pillows were removed from their packaging. I understand this practice but make it super clear to customers on the page and do not bury this vital information! I have bad neck issues and cannot spare the added barrier of plastic packaging while I try out pillows. Knowing this I made extra effort to place them immediately into clean cases and carefully preserved the original packaging so that they would be in returnable condition. Nope, absolutely no returns or flexibility from the seller so now I am left with three non-helpful pillows taking up space. I rechecked the product page looking for a return policy to see if I made an oversight - there is absolutely no mention of NO RETURNS. For most products, Amazon has a 30 day return policy which is not applicable and not stated on the page. Again, make it clear and do not mislead unsuspecting customers! I am writing this review to warn others and highlight this issue. If you are buying to test it out; hope it works for you or be prepared to kiss your money goodbye.";Missing return policy. No returns EVER.
0;8.0;4.0;229.0;"I didn't have any neck pain to relieve when I bought this pillow. I chose it because I thought it would provide a sort of head-cradling feel, which I like. In retrospect, that was an unrealistic expectation.\n\nIt's a very well-made pillow, but this firm version is *really* firm. Also, it puts too much pressure on the base of my skull--I'm guessing that even the narrower of the two ""lobes"" is too wide for the length of my neck. (I'm 5' 3"".)\n\nIf you really love firm pillows, or if your doctor recommends this type of pillow, go for it. But if you're just a casual shopper looking for a comfy pillow, this might not be the one for you.";Well-Constructed, But Geared for Special Needs
33;9.0;4.0;154.0;"About a couple years ago I began experimenting with pillows, because the standard pillows I had were annoying me in a number of ways. They were too soft, even the supposedly ""extra firm"" pillows I bought. So when I slept on my side, I'd have to fold the side of the pillow under itself in order to get any decent firmness. And invariably over time even that wouldn't work, because the material would always wear out. I often found myself sleeping with my arm tucked under the pillow, but that would cause my arm to lose blood circulation. It was really sub-optimal no matter what I tried and no matter what pillow I used. I'm a light sleeper, too, so that made it even worse.\n\nThen I tried out one of those memory foam pillows with the two bumps in it. Actually, I think I bought a cheap foam rubber version rather than true memory foam. It was a lot more firm than the normal pillows, so I thought it would do well. Pretty quickly, however, I found myself waking up with a stiff, sore neck. It was so bad that I just couldn't even turn my head any more than about 20 degrees. And that was every single day practically, for almost a year. Memory foam or latex foam would have done the same thing, I believe.\n\nFinally I decided to buy one of these Tri-core pillows. Immediately, the next day my neck pain had completely gone away. I thought it was a fluke, but I've had this pillow for about a month now, and so far no neck pain.\n\nWhat I really like about it is its firmness. It's about as firm as you can get without it being hard. It makes all the regular ""extra firm"" pillows seem like they're actually ""extra soft"". And firmness is a good thing. Without that firmness, your head just collapses down into the bed, and it causes your neck to get bent at an awkward angle, which leads to neck pain and sleeping problems.\n\nOn the other hand, you don't want it to be too firm. That would just cause pain. This Tri-core pillow has just enough give (softness) to allow you to rest easily without pressure points digging into your face, ears, and head. I like that.\n\nI'm a side and back sleeper. The instructions say to sleep right on the edge of the pillow if you're sleeping on the side, and in the middle of the pillow if you're sleeping on your back. But I don't always find myself following those instructions. I just naturally find a ""sweet spot"" somewhere between the middle and edge when sleeping on my side. But sleeping perfectly on the edge is good too. The point I'm making is that there are subtle variations in the depth and angle of the pillow and the way it makes you feel. You may have to play with it a bit to find out what makes you feel the best.\n\nI don't know how this pillow will perform over the long-term, since I've only had it a month now. But so far it doesn't appear to be losing any of its firmness. Or if it is, it's not enough to really notice. I'm sure it won't last forever. But at this price, you can afford to buy a new one when that day comes.\n\nI highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nUPDATE June 11, 2012:\n---------------------\n\nIt has been a while since I reviewed this pillow, and I've had a chance to try other pillows since then. It must be about a year and a half or so since I bought this product. I've been using it ever since. Here's an update.\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that the product has held up remarkably well. There's not much softening, wearing, or indentation of the pillow at all. It remains very firm despite using it more or less continuously the entire time. So that's very good.\n\nBut it hasn't been all good. At first it was great. But little by little the pillow started annoying me in different ways. Mostly, the trapezoidal depression in the middle of the pillow proved more difficult to tolerate than I wanted.\n\nI would often wake up in the middle of the night, because I was fighting with the pillow to find the best spot for my head. You can't just roll over in your sleep, because you'll end up in the hole with no support whatsoever.\n\nIt's great if you never roll over.\n\nIt's also good if you only sleep on your back and one side but not the other side. For example, if you go back and forth between sleeping on your back and your left side, but never your right side, then that's okay. But going from the left to the right side is not going to be easy. And because it's not easy, it requires some thought, which will actually wake you up.\n\nSomething else that annoyed me about this pillow was the thickness of the pillow on the sides. I'm all for support. Support is a real problem with most pillows. This pillow has super support. However, the fact that it was too thick for me meant that it felt a bit too firm at times. I wanted to compress the pillow down with my head, but because it's so firm, I couldn't.\n\nSo if I were making a wish list of future improvements, I wish this pillow didn't have the hole in the middle. I just want a constant thickness throughout the pillow. And I would like it to be a bit less thick. And it would be nice if it had a thin top layer of memory foam or something just to relieve pressure points a bit better.\n\nBecause of these irritations, I'm now removing one star. I used to rate it at 5 stars. I now rate it at 4 stars.\n\nOn the plus side, it never caused neck problems. It was great in that respect. It is still a very good and dependable pillow that I recommend trying, especially for its price.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I recently purchased an excellent pillow that solves all of the problems I've seen with pillows. It's called the IntelliPillow. It's made with ""intelli-gel"". You can find it at: [...]\n\nThat IntelliPillow is much more expensive, but in my opinion at this time, no other pillow beats it. If you're trying one pillow after another with no luck, it might be better to buy the IntelliPillow and be done with it. Might save you money in the long run. I just wish Amazon was selling it so I could review it.\n\nHope that helps!";Like night and day.
30;10.0;3.0;96.0;"I purchased this pillow as a replacement for my old Chiroflow water pillow. The Chiroflow worked very well, but it was a pain to maintain. It served me well, for several years, until it sprung a leak. I initially planned to purchase another Chiroflow, but changed my mind based on the reviews. Had the quality gone down since I purchased mine? I decided to try the Tri-Core pillow instead based on the positive reviews and the fact that it required much less care than a water pillow.\n\nThe Tri-Core pillow is very well constructed. It didn't require a huge effort to put in a pillow case, like many specialty pillows. And it really does help relieve the pain in my neck. I just find it difficult to sleep on. It's like laying my head on a semi-comfortable brick. The pillow is extremely firm and has no ""give"". Should I have ordered the ""Gentle"" version? How many many men do you know that would order a ""Gentle"" anything for themselves? (My wife bought me the water pillow, just in case you were wondering.) I might order a ""Medium Soft"" pillow, but I don't know about a ""Gentle"" pillow. My point is, I most likely would have purchased a different pillow and be more satisfied if the seller used more common terms like ""Very Firm"". Whatever... I use it occasionally, when my neck is extremely sore, but not every night. At least until I find something more comfortable.";It takes some getting used to...
46;11.0;2.0;96.0;It is a good firm pillow, but only if you sleep on your back.  If you roll onto your side like I do in the middle of the night, the design seem to fold in my face.;Depends on how you sleep
14;12.0;5.0;33.0;I waited a while to write the review to be sure it was effective over time. But it definitely has been. My neck has definitely been less sore that the previous pillow, and it seems to be holding up to wear.\n\nBut the reason I'm back is because I also have to buy a second one, as one of the other commentators did. But my problem is the cat. She loves it, for some reason. I wake up and she's in the divot, I'm all squished over to the side. She never did that before with my previous pillows. I go into the room later and she's decided it's hers. You buy 'em baskets, kitty condos, carriers...and they steal your favorite pillow. Furry little thieves.;My pillow was acquired by another member of the household.
27;13.0;5.0;48.0;"The Tri-Core pillow is really quite good.  Worth every penny to me to help get a good night's sleep.  It really does help with that for me.  I like it so much, I bought one for when I am travelling for work and keep it at the hotel.  That way, I have the same type pillow most of the time.\n\nThe comments on the firmness of the pillow are fair.  It's a therapeutic pillow that attempts to encourage your neck in to a proper ""Cervical Lordosis"", that's that small inward curve in the neck.  I've had neck problems for years, and I remember the shock I felt when I started using products to address the lordodis.  It just feels different.\n\nMy read of the firmness comments (and all due respect to their experience) is that most of us with neck pain have gotten so used to having such bad posture, that good posture just feels funny.  This type of pillow ""insistently encourages"" (my words) to keep your neck in good posture while you sleep. With the proper posture established, your neck can actually relax.\n\nTo me, it feels like when I am at the chiropractor and they are gently tractioning and pulling up on the neck, which feels great, to me.  The pillow allows me to sleep in that state.\n\nHere are my thoughts.  If you are looking at this product, you have neck or back pain.  First off, I recommend educating yourself on the spine, how it works, why things go wrong, and what you can do about it.  Robin McKenzie's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7-Steps-to-a-Pain-Free-Life-How-to-Rapidly-Relieve-Back-and-Neck-Pain/dp/0452282772/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7 Steps to a Pain-Free Life: How to Rapidly Relieve Back and Neck Pain</a>, is a classic.  I give those away to work and client colleagues I hear have back pain.  That book is actually the best money I ever spent.  It's been that instrumental to managing my spine. You can read my review from a couple of years ago.\n\nFurther, several years ago, my chiropractor recommended the Core Product Dual Core pillow,\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Double-Core-Select-Pillow/dp/B007G4U32I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Double Core Select - Pillow</a>.  If you are new to cervical pillows, this may be a better starting point to ease in to what it feels like to actually have your neck in a state of good posture.  It has two levels of firmness, so you can play around.  The reviews of them wearing out are pretty fair.  It's made of foam.  But it is good.\n\nPersonally, and this just me (and follows my overall experience over the past several years), I would get the book, the dual core and the tri core.  First you have to understand what good posture is.  That's the book.  Then you have to get a pillow that works for you.  It may be the dual core, may be the tri core.  You may take to the tri core right away.  If that's the case, give the dual core to a friend with neck pain - spread the goodness.  If you take to the dual core, use it and keep the tri core.  You can use it on the floor while relaxing for 10-15 minutes, and you may just end up using it as your primary pillow.\n\nJust my humble thoughts.  I wish you the best managing your neck pain.\n\nLuck,\n\nR";"Great product - addressing the ""Firmness"" comments"
44;14.0;5.0;47.0;This pillow does take about a week or so to get used to like anything else that's new.  My chiropractor suggested this pillow to me a few years ago.  I ended up buying one on my second visit to his clinic.  I was told I had a military neck, where the curvature isn't quite the norm.  I had bad migranes which were caused by tension in the neck area.  This pillow made most of the tension and migranes go away.  I moved out of country a while back and most of my items went into storage along with my 1st pillow.  A few months ago I had surgery on my right shoulder and had trouble sleeping on a regular pillow.  I'd given a couple pillows a try and still was aching.  Then I remembered this pillow.  I went to Amazon to see if they had it since you can find about anything on the site.  I ordered it about a month ago and have been sleeping on it since.  The shoulder doesn't ache and I get a good nights rest without accidently rolling onto my bad shoulder.  I've convinced my physical therapist in buying one too.  I've suggested this pillow to many and all that have gotten one love it.;Best pillows ever!
47;15.0;5.0;43.0;After 3 whiplash injuries and many years of pain and problems followed by many therapies, I went to a chiropractor who recommended these pillows and sold them in the office. I was skeptical especially since I have tried most of the pillows which were recommended over the years and none had ever helped. I had chronic neck pain and stiffness and for the past several years I also had shoulder pain. I have used this pillow for over a year now and must say I have had a huge improvement in my neck and my shoulders and have very little if any pain at all. There was a breaking in period with this pillow, but I continued to use it and within a few days, I loved it. I am currently on Amazon to purchase a new Tri-core cervical pillow since I recently went on vacation and packed my pillow as always but unfortunately, a bottle of perfume leaked and my pillow is too highly fragranced to use any more. I did go back to the same chiropractors office and bought another pillow, but it was a different brand and although it is shaped much the same, it is hard and just not the same. I love my Tri-core pillow and will not use anything else.;Love it!
12;16.0;5.0;17.0;I'd like to say I love this pillow but my cat hasn't given me a chance to use it. Guess I'll have to order another for myself. It really is a nice pillow and has enough different thicknesses and firmnesses to find an area that works.;Great pillow.
9;17.0;5.0;14.0;I love this pillow.\n\nI've had the wavy cervical memory foam pillows in the past which were alright but after awhile they would lose their support. I also tried a 'bamboo shredded memory foam pillow' from Amazon but returned it after a month. Positioning that pillow would start out OK for me the fall asleep but then through the night the insides would shift and would leave my neck craned at a horrible angle, ow.\n\nThis pillow is awesome. All sides feel like they offer great support without feeling too firm. Depending on how my neck feels, I'll switch between using the large neck support or the small neck support. I love that when I'm laying on my back and I lean my head just a bit to one side or another the raised sides offer support so that my head's not completely rolling over to the side. The sides themselves are also great when I want to turn over and sleep on my side.;I love this pillow
21;18.0;1.0;24.0;This pillow is absolutely NOT for side sleepers. I sleep only on my side and was unable to find a comfortable position to sleep in with this pillow.

Do NOT buy this pillow if you sleep on your side.;Not for side sleepers.
45;19.0;1.0;29.0;As I'm getting a bit older, I'm finding that I sometimes wake up with neck pain from the angle I sleep on our Select Comfort bed. Let me say right off the bat I'm even suspect that the bed may be part of the problem.\n\nLiving in remote Alaska, I bought two pillows, one soft and one hard, without trying them out. The first couple nights I received some relief from the pillow, but as I tried to break it in, I found the sides, top and bottom of the pillow very hard. And this was the 'soft' one! It's almost like trying to sleep on the arm of a chair, it's that hard.\n\nSilly me, while trying it out, I took off the plastic. That immediately voided my return policy. Now we have two of these and the best I can do is wrap them in plastic and send them to charity.\n\nDon't buy these pillows, they don't work. I originally tried a Tempurpedic pillow at my in-laws that worked very well. I'm going to buy one of those and write these two pillows off as a loss.;Very hard pillow around the edges--caused neck pain!
3;20.0;5.0;5.0;This pillow is a miracle! I snore pretty much every night and keep my husband (who's a light sleeper) awake more than I'd like to admit. I did some research and read the reviews and ultimately decided to try this pillow out. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and my sleep quality has definitely improved. I know this matter-of-factly, because I wear a fitbit to bed that tracks my sleeping habits. Prior to using this pillow, I was awake/restless almost an hour per night, and now with this tri-core cervical pillow, that has been cut down to about 20 min of awake/restlessness per night. My husband has also informed me that my snoring has reduced significantly. I definitely recommend this pillow!;Miracle pillow!!!
35;21.0;4.0;23.0;For me, this is the one.  With a normal pillow, I often wake up with a stiff neck and/or a headache.  Once the neck is out, the lower back isn't far behind.  The Tri-Core standard size support pillow handles this.  Within 3 days of using it the stiff neck and headaches are a fading memory.  (As a side note, I use the narrow side for my neck with the wide side of the pillow between my head and the headboard.  I've tried the wide side and it produces the same stiff neck, etc as a normal pillow.)\nThe only reason why this doesn't rate 5 stars is because, contrary to claims I've read, the narrow support flattens down after about 6 months and I need to replace the pillow.  Small price to pay for a healthy neck and back.;Handles the problem

And if you think you are going to buy it to see how it feels and work, don't expect to be able to return it. I was unsatisfied with the pillow because laying on my side was extremely uncomfortable.  I submitted an RMA to return it after just one week and only a few hours of laying on it - the seller refused, citing the ""Personal Products"" exception in Amazon's return policies.

I tried sleeping on this pillow every night for about week and had a miserable experience.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm a 6-foot male with an averaged sized head.. perhaps this pillow works better for people of different shapes and sizes.\n\nThe side-sleeping sections of the pillow are too firm, too high, and caused me constant ear pain. It was bad enough that it woke me up every night. I also found that I could not sleep on my back with this pillow. It was too awkward and left me tossing and turning all night.\n\nI gave up after a week and have been sleeping better ever since.;Side-Sleepers Stay Away! Ear pain!
23;26.0;1.0;12.0;I had been using these pillows for more than 20 years at the suggestion of my chiropractor.  When I bought the last one several months ago I noticed it felt different.  Overstuffed maybe.  Instead of helping I actually woke up with headaches every single day.  Since I couldn't return it I slit it open and pulled some of the stuffing out and stitched it up again.  It was still too much and caused pain.  I quit using it months ago and I tried something else.  Very disappointed.  I used these pillows for so long and I truly relied on them.  Now I am starting all over and looking for the one that will work.;Not the same quality as it used to be.
32;27.0;5.0;15.0;"I suffer from MS and Fibromyalgia.  As a result have a lot of issues with my neck, and frequently have debilitating neck pain that takes me down for days at a time.\n\nI ordered this pillow after reading some of the reviews on here, but at the same time, I was a little dubious, as often a product doesn't measure up to all the hype.\n\nThat was not the case here.  From the first night I used this pillow, I had a wonderful, relaxing sleep and woke up with no neck tension or pain.  I'm not a back-sleeper; I generally sleep on my side and toward my stomach.  But regardless of what position you sleep in, this pillow keeps your head positioned so that it's not angled and so that your neck is not stressed.  There are side cushions that gently cushion your head when you sleep on your sides or your back.  The funny thing is that there is a scooped out section in the middle where your head goes, and if you feel the thickness of the actual pillow in that area, it's pretty thin.  You'd think that it wouldn't offer much support or cushion, but once you lay on it, you can't get over how comfortable it feels.\n\nAt the top and bottom of the pillow is an area that gently cushions the neck.  Again, whether you're laying on your side or your back, it supports your neck so that your had stays virtually horizontal.  For me this is critical.  Other, conventional pillows tend to angle the head up so that the chin is down toward the chest (if you're on your back) or if sleeping on your side, the pillow angles your head sideways toward your shoulder - this is very bad if you already suffer from neck problems.\n\nSince many of us spend a lot of our day looking down at a PC or down at our phones, this is the source of many of the neck problems we suffer from.  This pillow does just the opposite, by holding the head at the proper angle.\n\nI used to go in once a month to my Neurologist to get triggerpoint injections in my neck because the pain in my neck, and radiating up over my head was so severe.  Since I started using this pillow, I haven't had to go back for any triggerpoint injections.\n\nI realize this may not work for everyone, but for me, this pillow has been a godsend.\n\nI have so say that I'm really very surprised at how great it feels to lay on - so relaxing.\n\nIf you suffer from chronic neck problems or even if you just are looking for a more comfortable pillow to sleep on, I highly recommend it.";Amazing product - If you suffer from neck problems, get it!!
8;28.0;1.0;6.0;I first purchased one of these through my chiropractor.  I was really pleased with it and when it was time to get a new one, I purchased same pillow from Amazon.  Unfortunately, this pillow seems to be lower quality than my first one.  I've only had it a few month and already the interior has split at the neck area which now doesn't offer the right kind of support.  Each morning, I am waking up with neck pain.;I was really pleased with it and when it was time to get ...

7;30.0;2.0;5.0;Devent enough pillow, but it actually caused me further neck issues.  I do not recommend it.  I went back to a memory foam pillow (new) and bam, neck problems gone.\n\nTo lounge with though?  Perfectly fine.;Not for regular use
39;31.0;3.0;13.0;My regular pillow is a contour memory foam pillow. After a neck injury, that pillow started to hurt me so I searched for  a better pillow and came across the Tri-core which seemed to be a better solution as I mostly sleep on my side, but also occasionally on my back.\n\nThe problem with this pillow is the large indentation in the middle. It's perfect for when you want to sleep on your back, but turning to the side you had better move your head out of the indent and onto the wings of the pillow. Easy enough to do when you are awake, but if you turn during the night, you might not always move out of the indentation. In the morning you end up with a strong ache in your neck as you haven't been positioned correctly.\n\nAfter trying to get used to the pillow for a week+, I have given up and unfortunately cannot return this pillow. I'm going to go back to a memory foam contour pillow as a better solution since it works better for me.\n\nI have given the pillow three stars.... it is well made and would seem to hold up well, assuming it was comfortable for you.;Not as good as advertised
10;32.0;5.0;5.0;"I was wary of buying another pillow after years of only being able to tolerate NeckBone pillows, and even they were never quite supportive enough. I've been a back sleeper since childhood, and I require something firm under my neck and little-to-nothing under my head. I've become disenchanted with the NeckBone pillows, as the manufacturing changed years ago, leaving the quality iffy, but every other pillow I've tried has been useless. I researched many options for ""cervical"" pillows, and, after looking carefully at some very expensive brands, decided to try this (relatively) inexpensive Tri-Core pillow. The shape seemed perfect for my needs: support that firmly cradles my neck, a depression for my head to fit into, and side bolsters to keep my head from falling to one side or the other. It LOOKED like it would work... And I am happy to say that it is AMAZING! I slept comfortably with it the very first night I used it, with no breaking-in period, no soreness or stiff neck the next day, just refreshing rest. I didn't have to wake up and reposition the pillow at all, I didn't have to adjust the stuffing, I just put the thicker bolster under my neck (I like more support), put my head in the little divot in the middle, and rested in comfort all night. I've also tried a bit of side-sleeping (not my favored position), and was very happy with the way the pillow handled support on my side as well -- I could still breathe instead of having a face full of stuffing. I waited until I'd used the pillow a decent amount of time before writing the review, and after twelve nights I can safely say that I LOVE THIS PILLOW! By the way, since I'm always seeing reviews from folks who say they got the items for free or at a discount for their ""unbiased"" review, let me state this unequivocally: I paid FULL PRICE on Amazon for this pillow, I got NO DISCOUNT and NO PERKS to write this. I am just that ECSTATIC to find a pillow that works for me! I can't say it will work for people who favor side sleeping or stomach sleeping, but as a back sleeper who tends to get neck pain, shoulder pain, headaches from other pillows, I can say definitively that this pillow is now one of my favorite things ever.";Finally, the perfect pillow for this back sleeper!!!!
15;33.0;3.0;6.0;"I purchased one of these tri-core pillows with a great deal of skepticism but out of desperation to help my neck pain. I had tried various sleeping positions, tried different ""regular"" pillows of varying softness, tried long neck and shoulder stretches, and tried some basic exercises and weight training specifically for the neck and shoulder muscles. My neck's range of motion was limited to about 45 in either direction and I felt sharp twinges it I tried to extend further. This affected many day-to-day activities, but most of all it made driving difficult, as looking over my shoulders became an exercise in twisting my upper body and shoulders to be able to look far enough.\n\nWhen the pillow arrived, it had a foul chemical odor, but washing it by hand with regular clothing detergent eliminated any bad smells. I had to let the pillow dry for a full two days, and afterwards I put it to proper use. The very first night, I slept on my back for the first time in as many months as I could remember. My neck and back pain had meant I could only comfortably sleep on my side or belly, but this pillow immediately relieved enough pain for a full night's rest on my back. I soon alternated sleeping on my sides, but it's worth noting that you have to shift the pillow slightly off-center for proper head and neck support when sleeping on your side.\n\nAfter about a week or two with my new pillow, my neck pain had faded away and my range of motion had been restored. I was amazed that a simple change in sleep support like this could have such a dramatic effect on me and my health. I've been using this pillow for several months now and, after borrowing it a few times, my wife said she loved it and we bought one for her too. By far this has been the best low-cost investment in our long-term health and I would strongly recommend it to anyone else with neck, shoulder, and back pain.";I purchased one of these tri-core pillows with a great deal of skepticism but out of desperation to help ...
11;34.0;1.0;5.0;Inconsistent quality. I purchased this exact pillow 7 months ago, after I had a C5-C6 herniation from a car accident. My neck was in pain every night. This pillow really made a difference for 4-5 months.  After 5 months, the pain was back int he mornings.  I realized the pillow had worn out.  I purchased the exact same one.  This time, the pillow was either overfilled or much firmer.  I figured a week or so of use and it will wear down.  It hasn't. It's like a completely different pillow.  I have used it for weeks and wake every day with neck pain.  I stopped using this and switched to another brand and the pain is gone.  I contacted this company, and they thanked me for my feedback and hoped to do business again.  They didn't acknowledge the issue, problem, or offer any help.  I recommend that you stay clear of this pillow and company.  Why waste your money, it's a gamble if you get the same pillow twice.  Inconsistent product that the seller doesn't stand behind.;Inconsistent quality, don't gamble with your money.
29;35.0;3.0;10.0;As a side sleeper, I cannot recommend this pillow. I should have paid attention to one of the reviewers who said it did not work for side sleepers. I agree with him/her.;Works only for back sleepers
20;36.0;2.0;6.0;I won't say that it is a bad product or pillow, but it certainly didn't work for me. I had so much neck and back pain after sleeping on this for 3 nights, I could barely move by the 3rd day. I do have disc issues, so the purpose for the purchase was to help with my pain. It definitely made it MUCH worse, and I really mean MUCH worse. Be careful if this is why you want to purchase this pillow. Everyone is different, and every pain issue is different. There is no universal pillow solution. You just have to keep trying until you find the answer. On a brighter note, I moved it to my husband's side of the bed. He's sleeping on it, and it has helped his snoring. Guess it was a good purchase then.;I won't say that it is a bad product or pillow
42;37.0;4.0;11.0;I bought this pillow about a year ago after I had a ruptured cervical disk and pain thru my arms and shoulders. PT took care of the pain and other issues.

I used it for 4 hours each night and then now I use it all night.\n\nIt worked for me because I persisted with the use of this pillow. I wish you good luck.;Good product but needs to being used to

28;41.0;2.0;7.0;"After receiving the pillow and product information inserts, this pillow is hardly what I call a side sleeper pillow. If your dominant sleeping position is ""side sleeper"", I would strongly recommend the BioSense Memory Foam Shoulder Pillow. The  Tri Core Pillow does not keep your head and neck in a straight alignment. What I failed to realize, the ""trapezoid"" center indents by a fair margin, which might make for a comfortable position for a back sleeper; but not a side sleeper. The product insert that I received when I received my pillow, shows the side sleeper sleeping on the side edge of the pillow. Who sleeps comfortable on the edge of their pillow? Certainly not me. My head wants to roll to the center indentation of the pillow, which puts my head lower than my neck, which is the entire reason why I wanted a new pillow to relieve neck & shoulder pain. If you are a dominant back sleeper,  this pillow would probably be very comfortable. For a dominant side sleeper, I would not recommend it, unless you have a unconditional money back guarantee. The BioSense I have had for weeks, and I have noticed an enormous improvement in my sleep comfort. I have never have had any affiliation with either company products mentioned in this review. It is completely unbiased. Just a side sleeper looking for a pillow that is comfortable.";Ads Are A Misrepresentation Of This Pillow

I do like the support and comfort and over-all design, I just wish it were a little bit different.  The pillow I received looks a little different than the one pictued here - the center hollow area seems/looks much bigger.\n\nI find the pillow very comfortable to sleep on while laying on my back, the part that goes under the neck supports perfectly and my head is cradled in the hollow part in the center.\n\nThe part I have trouble with is when sleeping on my side - you are supposed to lay your head on the sides of the pillow, not in the center where the hollow part is.  I didn't understand this until I read the instruction sheet that came with the pillow.\n\nThe foam that is in the sides is super comfortable - I just wish there was more if it, it's a very narrow strip to lay your head on, especially if you share a bed with somebody.  I'm either sleeping way on the edge of the bed or right in my husband's face if my head is laying on just one side of the pillow, so obviously it's a bit awkward.  If the side strips were just a bit wider I think the pillow would be great.;Like it, but don't love it
31;44.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased this pillow about 6 months ago at the prompting of my chiropractor. He suggested that it might go a long way in helping to treat my back and neck pain in conjunction with my chiropractic adjustments...and boy was he ever RIGHT!!\n\nAt first, this pillow takes some getting used to...I'll admit that. However, Core Products doesn't pretend that it doesn't either. They clearly state in the use and care instructions that accompany this pillow that it could take some people up to two weeks before they would reap the full benefits of using this type of cervical-correction therapy device. The first few days, it was the hardest pillow I had ever slept on. It made my face hurt a bit, since it doesn't give in to the weight of your head and just instantly deflate or flatten out easily like a regular store-bought feather or cotton pillow always has for me. Instead, it holds your head, neck, and back in proper alignment all night! Well, my face may have been sore (which went away after about 5 days or so of use)...but the back and neck pain I've suffered from everyday for the past five years... yeah...it started to finally fade!! Every night that I used the pillow, I began to hurt less and less everyday!!\n\nNow,don't misunderstand. I'm not saying that it's some sort of miracle. After all, the pillow isn't some wonder drug that makes back pain just magically disappear. It is however, simply one of the best and most usefully important tools I've come accross yet that has consistently helped me in the daily battle with my back/neck pain. If you use this pillow at night, while getting regular(usually once a month or so) chiropractic adjustments, there is no doubt that this amazing,simple,drug-free solution to improper sleeping posture won't at least help anyone lessen their back pain, if not even completely eliminate it all together, if you're lucky,lol.\n\nBottom line - It is a WONDERFUL PRODUCT!! Not only do I use it everyday...as I write this review, I'm here to purchase a second one as a gift! If that doesn't say how highly I would recommend it...I don't know what else could!!!;The Best Pillow I've Ever Owned...Bar None!!

It didn't take me any getting used to because I was coming from the Arc4life pillow but the Tri-Core was much more comfortable. I just rotated it 180 degrees so i'm using the smaller wedge.\nThe advantage the Tri-Core has over the Arc4life, other than being less than half the price, is that the indentation for your head is much deeper. Without the wedge part which goes under your neck also being bigger. I just felt my head rested much more comfortably in the Tri-core. The sides of the Tri-Core are also more firm which makes sleeping on your side extremely comfortable too. Would highlight recommend!";Much better for me than Arc4life pillow

36;48.0;5.0;5.0;I purchased this pillow because after complaining about waking up with headaches 3-4 days per week, I was diagnosed with a straight neck (most people have curved necks). Doctor recommended this pillow and I love it! I am headache free! For those readers who like to sleep on their sides, this pillow works fine. The key is to read the directions on the sheet that comes with the pillow. It says that when sleeping on your side, you should sleep on the edge of the pillow. Don't try to sleep on your side by resting your head in the center of the pillow because that is the concave part and won't give you any support. The only problem I have with this pillow is that the stuffing seems to lose it's form over time, so I have already gone through 2 pillows in 6 months and at $35 per pillow, this can get expensive. As long as I'm headache free, however, I will pay the money! Just wish there was a pillow made out of something that would keep it's shape longer. Maybe next time I order, I will keep the plastic on before I cover with pillow case.;No more headaches!
43;49.0;5.0;5.0;I have tried too many ergonomic pillows to list and this is finally the right one for me. I have had muscular tension in my neck for decades. I've been using a memory foam pillow for the last couple of years while seeing a chiropractor regularly. Recently I decided to try a new pillow that offered better support for my neck. After some research I ordered the Tri-Core to try for a while. It took me only one night to get accustomed to the unique shape. I was able to quickly find a comfortable spot lying on either side and there's no beating how this feals when lying on my back! I've now had it for 2.5 weeks and I don't know how I slept without it for so long! I'm getting full nights of restful sleep and wake without any neck/shoulder discomfort at all (which is a miracle). I would strongly recommend this pillow for anyone who suffers from chronic neck discomfort - it's the best I've found!;I love this pillow!

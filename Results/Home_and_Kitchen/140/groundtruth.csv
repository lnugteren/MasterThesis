74;1.0;4.0;684.0;"Ye gads.  I forgot all about the fierce partisanship amongst purchasers that this wee little machine invokes.  Last year, I dutifully combed through all of the reviews and was almost pursuaded to look to another machine.  Thank the stars I was not.  Like many, I was won over by the lure of (1)the thermal carafe, (2) the auto grind&brew feature, and (3) the shininess.  I also trusted the Cuisinart name and had been previously pleased with the Brew Central.  I noted, however, that many writers were highly displeased with (4) the noise and (5) the mess.  So, after a year, here are my experiences:\n\n(1)  The thermal carafe rocks out loud.  Yes, pre-heating the carafe seems to keep the coffee hotter for longer, but on the crazy work-mornings that I use the auto-grind&brew function, I do not pre-heat and find no need to, as I am out of the house at light speed.  Note that the coffee is still scaldingly hot.  People seem irritated/perplexed at the slowness with which coffee is dispensed from the carafe, as well as the steep pouring angles necessitated by the carafe.  I am not at all disturbed by either; however, a relative in need of immediate coffee discovered that one can get faster pouring by just removing the lid.  Which defeats the awesome vacuum-packed thermal hotness, but seems a likely remedy for those with a fundamental aversion to slow pours.  As far as weird geometry issues, I have nothing to offer.\n\n(2)  The auto grind&brew is very convenient.  It has always worked flawlessly for me and really amazes and pleases guests who may rise before residents.\n\n(3)  It is damn shiny.\n\n(NB:  I have a lot of stainless in the kitchen and, through trial and error, have found that the Method stainless steel cleaner keeps it all damn shiny and keeps me from going stark raving from the constant buffing and rubbing).\n\n(4)  The noise?  Really not that unusual for a coffee bean grinder.  I did not notice that it was any louder than other grinders.  If the ""grind"" portion of the auto grind&brew is waking one too early, I would imagine that one could either pregrind or use ground beans and just skip the ""grind"" function.  While it is intriguing to imaging a space age machine with stealth grind mode, I would urge potential buyers to neither expect silence nor let lack of silence keep you from buying this machine.\n\n(5)  The ire over the mess was what nearly kept me from purchasing this maker.  And I completely forgot about the issue until just now when I re-read some of the reviews.  I guess that I don't understand what ""mess"" they mean.  There are seven parts to this thing that I clean:  carafe/lid, filter/basket/lid, and grinder base/lid.  I rinse the carafe and filter with hot water and clean the rest with hot soapy water.  It all takes approximately 2.5 minutes.  I never have to clean the rest of the machine.  I usually tilt the top-loader lid open to let condensation out after brewing is done.  I occasionally wipe the inside of the machine down with a damp cloth.  I have replaced the water filter a couple of times.  But altogether, clean-up is not that big of a deal.  Maybe others are not getting a tight enough seal on the the grinder parts?\n\nSUMMARY:  I have had this machine for over a year and have never had a single problem with it.  It makes delicious, hot coffee.  I was almost deterred by the problems that others have had with it, but am glad that I opted to take my chances.  I gave it four, rather than five stars because so many people have had problems with it.  Even though I have not experienced these problems, the negative feedback must nonetheless be taken into consideration.\n\ncheers!\n\n~currer bell";In defense of the Grind & Brew
126;2.0;5.0;518.0;- previous was the typical old plastic type with glass carafe\nGood Points:\n- much considerable improvement in coffee taste now\n- the thermal carafe with autoseal until poured keeps coffee hot and no stale or burnt taste, it is double lined with stainless steel\n- auto shutoff of heating element immediately after brewing prevents burning of coffee and electricity bills\n- the 1-4 cup extra heat excellent idea\n- the built-in grinding process\n- choice of using paper filter or gold filter basket\n- beeping tells you when coffee is ready\n- does not have that ugly water level marker, it has a built-in marker where you pour water, a 3-D step ladder sort of speak\n- does not expell any heat or humidity from unit, well sealed\n- nice design and looks\nBad Points:\n- cannot tell amount coffee left in carafe\n- pours out slowly from carafe\n- carafe autoseal feature requires you to pour at a steeper angle to get faster flow output which still isn't fast enough for me\n- grinder howls for about 30 seconds when running, it does not adjust grind-time for amount of coffee beans inside, it defaults to a 10 cup grind, solving this would require some clever engineering idea\n- I find I have to clean more than my old machine, I clean the grinder and lid, basket and basket lid, ... the grinder does create a lot fine coffee dust which does get packed into every nook and cranny;I purchased the thermal carafe version 10 cup
4;3.0;5.0;5.0;I read a lot of negative reviews here but then I read a lot of positive as well. What I can tell you is that I absolutely love this coffee maker and it has actually made a positive impact in my life. You might think how can a coffee maker impact your life? Well keep reading.\n\nI bought this coffee make 6 months ago. I have had several other coffee makers but never one that actually grind the coffee for you. I always bought preground coffee and put it in the machine and then added sweetener or creamer to make it taste good. Well I decided to make a change in my coffee drinking and try the fresh ground approach and this was the coffee maker I chose to use. First I bought packaged coffee beans, and this was a nice coffee, but then I realized there were stores around me that allowed me to buy and blend and mix my own coffee beans. I even found a place that will let me roast my own beans. I have tried coffee's from around the world and learned to really appreciated the true flavors of fresh coffee. I no longer use sweeteners or creamers, I savor the flavor of good coffee. There is something special really sitting down and just taking time out of the hectic day to just enjoy a good coffee. Even when I first wake up I sit back and relax and let the flavor and smell of the coffee get me going. Coffee has become something I enjoy rather than just a quick shot of caffeine to get me going. I sat back the other day and watched the fall leaves come down in the yard while sipping on a mellow Hawaiian blend. I actually take my coffee with me to work in a thermos because it is so much better than work coffee and it helps actually to relax me. So if you want to really appreciate coffee then this is a great coffee maker. If you just are in it for the caffeine rush in the morning and trying to get by then maybe this is not the one for you.\n\nThen a couple of the complaints here I will address as well. First off it is noisy while grinding. Yes, it is, I won't tell you that it isn't. It is grinding coffee beans for Pete's sake. What do you expect. It is no louder than a hand held grinder or anything like that. Most people probably notice the noise because they set it to go off in the morning and everything is louder then. I personally set it to start grinding about 1 minute after my alarm goes off. I tend to hit snooze at least once so this way my alarm wakes me up not the grinding. I do hear it in my bedroom, but again, it is grinding fresh coffee. Also this grinding phase is only for about 20-30 seconds. After that you hear nothing.\n\nSecond people complain about cleaning. You do need to clean all the parts that come into contact with the coffee pretty much every pot. This takes me all of about 5 minutes for each pot of coffee. That's it just 5 minutes to make sure I have fresh brewed and wonderful tasting coffee. You do not need to scrub everything between pots, you can just rinse the carafe and rinse the filter area because it is just going to get wet again so they do not need a scrub and dry. Then rinse the grinding container and then wipe dry with a paper towel and you are good to brew another pot. I do give it an actual scrubbing on the weekends to remove the oils from the coffee and any powder left up in the grinding area under the lid as there is some fine coffee dust up there and easier to clean out regularly than let it build up.\n\nThen people complain about it pouring slow. Well this is a carafe after all. Which is personally a very nice design. I do not ever have to worry about burning or scalding the pot by putting an empty coffee pot back on a hot machine. This carafe will keep the coffee hot for hours and warm way into the evening. If you need it to pour fast, like when I am getting ready to go to work and fill my thermos, I just remove the lid and it pours as fast as you can tip it.;Best coffee maker I have ever owned
1;4.0;2.0;237.0;"Normally, Cuisinart is synonymous with quality. And I love my Cuisinart food processor. Love the small food processor, too. But their grind-and-brew coffee makers are poorly-made plastic junk.  I had the original one...everything with two plastic connectors now has only one, and I was always careful with it...I now have to balance the lid on the carafe, have to hold the top lid closed with clamps I've attached or the thing won't brew...\nSo when I saw the new model, I thought, ""Great! They must have fixed it!""  Just got it yesterday, and I'm already disappointed.  The first thing you'll notice is that the nice shiny metal is only real on the carafe. The rest is just a cheap faceplate over flimsy plastic on weak hinges and thin components.  I can almost feel it wanting to break every time I fill it.  The first model had to be completely dried out after every use because the steam backs up through the grinding components, leaving a trail of coffee-bean-coagulated-sweat all through the device. I'd hoped they'd have put some sort of steam backflow prevention mechanism in the new model...they did not.  Still have to dry out the whole works after every use. Even the compartment where only dry beans were placed.\nWith the thermal carafe version, the resting plate at the bottom does not heat, it only holds the carafe. I assume the glass version does act as a heating plate...So this morning, when I came to get my coffee, I thought perhaps I'd set the timer wrong. I didn't see the little light glowing to tell me that the thermal plate was working.  I had done it right, however; it just relies on the insulating properties of the thermal carafe to keep the coffee warm. Truth be told, I prefer that to burnt coffee...but that's the only good part of this device.\nI think, for my next grind-and-brew, I'll shell out the extra bucks for the Capresso.";Nice and shiny outside, same cheap plastic on the inside...
19;5.0;1.0;68.0;This coffee-maker does so much! It makes weak, watery coffee! It grinds beans if you want it to! It inexplicably floods the entire counter with half-brewed coffee when you aren't looking! Perhaps it could be used to irrigate crops... It is time-consuming to clean, but in fairness I should also point out that the stainless-steel thermal carafe is a durable item that has withstood being hurled onto the floor in rage several times.  And if all these features weren't enough, it's pretty expensive too. If faced with the choice between having a car door repeatedly slamming into my genitalia and buying this coffee-maker, I'd unhesitatingly choose the Cuisinart!  The coffee would be lousy, but at least I could still have children...;An extremely versatile machine!
51;6.0;5.0;52.0;"I was a skeptic after reading all the negative reviews, and even encountered a disgruntled elderly woman at the store who told me how much she despised this machine, but something in my gut said I should buy it and I did. I've had this coffeemaker for three months now and it's become one of my most loved possessions, right up there with my handsfree wireless and my favorite pens.\n\nIt is important to note that it takes a few brews to get to know your new coffeemaker. I too had the leak experience upon first brew, but I realized that I was obviously overfilling the water tank, despite what the level said. It's also taken some trial and error to get the right ratio of coffee to water, but one must understand that this is a factor of personal taste and shouldn't be dictated by some recipe. Yes, it takes a little extra effort to clean. But I've noticed that most nice things do take that extra effort to manage and maintain, and I don't mind getting my hands a smidge dirty in exchange for the result!\n\nIt does pour slower than the regular carafe. But that's a bit picky, don't you think? Seven seconds to fill your cup. What do you want, three seconds? What so great about that other four seconds? Is it life or death? If it is, you probably shouldn't be kicking back with a cup of coffee at the moment anyway. Plus, this is no regular carafe! I park this thing right next to me at the computer and don't have to travel back and forth to the kitchen to get more coffee - that's well worth the four seconds I'd save in the kitchen with my old coffeemaker.\n\nIt grinds loud? Of course it grinds loud. It's grinding. Just the nature of the word ""grind"" leads one to attach a certain amount of noise to the action in my mind. The process is swifter than my previous grind n' brew and actually a bit quieter - not that I mind the grind sound. I've come to appreciate it in a way.\n\nI'm not one to usually write a review, but it seemed that others picked at this product and I felt compelled to share my thoughts on what I consider to be a fantastic addition to the kitchen. By one if you're on the fence. I'll be enjoying my french roast while you think about it.";Love it.
3;7.0;5.0;54.0;"I have tried several of the brew & grind coffee makers, this by far beats them all..Especially the sleek design and the beautiful stainless steel...the coffee beans grind perfectly, and the taste is that of a commercial coffee shop.  The machine beeps when the coffee is done, however, if you can""t wait, the coffee pot is removeable with a very well designed pour spout, absolutely no dripping or mess..and stays hot all day long !  This machine comes apart very easily for cleaning..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!";This coffee maker has it all!!
134;8.0;4.0;49.0;We have had our new Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Thermal coffee maker for a week now.  We had ordered it online before we saw these reviews and based on the poor reviews of others almost cancelled our order, but decided to give it a try anyway.  Well, so far we are not disapointed at all.\nOurs was on backorder and perhaps some improvements have been made.\nUsing the gold filter basket along with a paper filter and a full grinder of normal bean coffee, it makes a very good and strong coffee.\nAs far as the complaints about cleaning...the only thing different than a normal coffee maker is that you must take out the grinding mechanism and rinse and towel dry after every use.  It slips out easily and we just rinse under hot water for about 30 seconds and then dry with a paper towel (there are only two parts to the grinder).  Does not take more than a minute or two and you can proceed to make another pot of cofee right away.\nThe coffee is very hot in the thermal carafe and seems to stay that way for hours.  It is a little difficult to pour out the last few ounces of coffee as the pour spout is set in from the side of the carafe.\nThe stainless model is not really stainless, but is simulated (plastic) stainless.  This was somewhat of a disappointment as I don't know how well the finish will hold up over time.\nAnother concern is that the opening and closing latches and hinges seem a little flimsy and poorly designed.  Sometimes hard to open or close.\nIn closing, where performance counts - a great cup of coffee - this coffee maker produces the results we were looking for in a sharp looking package.;Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew, Thermal
61;9.0;1.0;38.0;"We would not pass on this headache of a machine to anyone. After just six months, we have just tossed it out in the garbage. Why?\n\nStart out with the fact that you will no longer need an alarm clock. This machine sounds like a jet engine getting ready to take off when grinding and it will wake up the whole house if you use the automatic timer.\n\nThen, there is the tedious - and virtually impossible - task of cleaning this machine. There are too many parts to clean, and no matter what you do, you will still have a machine that routinely ""gums up"" with sticky coffee residue. The flawed design causes this problem. The grinder is right above the brewer, so you are going to get steam in the grinder no matter what you do. It's unavoidable. Result - gummy coffee build up throughout the entire machine.\n\nHeaven help you if you would like to brew another pot shortly after another. Since you have had to wash out the sticky grinder, plan on spending another five minutes attempting to dry it out before brewing your second pot..... you are trying to avoid the moisture in the grinder.... which contributes to the gummy mess.....which is unavoidable anyway. You get the picture.\n\nWe experienced all the problems others have mentioned --- the filter basket pops out in the middle of the brewing process resulting in a total mess. This same area sticks and will NOT open when you want it to open (i.e., when you push the little button on the side that is supposed to make the filter basket area pop open....)Both of these problems are due to the fact that the whole machine becomes a sticky mess. Either the basket area will not close properly, or if you do manage to get it closed, then it's stuck.\n\nWe attempted to keep this machine in clean and in working order. We washed all the parts each time, we let the parts dry before putting the pieces back, and we gave the machine a complete cleaning at least once a week, all to no avail.\n\nAfter all of this, the coffee was only ""so-so"" ...... it was weak even when we cut back on the water and filled the grinder as full as recommended.\n\nWe just bought a Capresso CoffeeTeam Luxe, and are optimistic. It is designed so that the grinder is completely separate from the brewing process; thus far, it seems to totally avoid the moisture problem in the grinder. It makes one-half the noise, takes one-fourth the time to clean, and using the same coffee, we got a much stronger and richer cup of coffee.\n\nBottom Line:  Don't buy the Cuisinart, and don't give it to your worst enemy!";Attention Cusinart: Save your good name and stick to food processors!
2;10.0;5.0;40.0;I had a disappointing experience with the Melitta Mill & Brew, but hated to give up the convenience of the automatic grind feature. The original Cuisinart Grind & Brew is so big and bulky looking that I was reluctant (but resigned) to purchase it. Then I saw an ad for the new design and ran out and grabbed one up. I'm no engineer, but whoever designed this coffeemaker thought of everything. It looks like a robot (we call it our coffee-bot) and everything about it is easy to use and well thought-out. Although still quite tall, it is less bulky than the original and the styling on the stainless steel model is beautiful. The thermal pot keeps the coffee hot without continual heating, so you never get that nasty over-cooked taste. Dinner guests were very impressed with the taste of the coffee. Once people hear about this coffeemaker, they won't be able to keep it on the shelves!;Beautiful, Functional and Great Coffee Too
106;11.0;1.0;28.0;"Don't buy this coffee pot! I can't believe Cuisinart made a piece of junk like this. Here are a few cons:\n1. The built in coffee grinder doesn't let you grind enough beans to make 10 cups of strong coffee. Either you have to grind it separately, defeating the whole purpose of this model, or you can only make 6-8 cups.\n2. The steam from the coffee soaks the grinder, turning it into a muddy mess you have to clean every time you make coffee.\n3. The grinder often leaves whole beans inside, clogging up the spout.\n4. When you pour the coffee, the carafe leaks, dripping a puddle of coffee onto your counter top.\n5. On several occasions I've set the timer only to wake up to coffee all over my kitchen floor! Yes, you read right. The coffee often doesn't even make it into the carafe. Rather, it leaks over the lid and ends up all over you counter top and kitchen floor. Not what I had in mind when ""waking up to the smell of coffee.""\nDo yourself a favor and pick a different model. This one is a lemon.";Don't buy it!
94;12.0;4.0;26.0;"I've had this coffee maker for about a year now. Given the wide variety of opinions, I thought I'd contribute my .02.\n\nPros:\n\n(*) It really makes good coffee.\n\nI'm scratching my head at the reviews who say the coffee is weak.\n\nThe grinding chamber is admittedly a bit small for those who like a lot bolder cup than I do. I have no problem brewing my standard amount, 8 cups of coffee at 1 *heaping* tablespoon of beans per cup (for a total of 8 heaping tablespoons). This is very standard and to me produces a very flavorful coffee. The grinding chamber can probably handle about 12 heaping tablespoons but not much more than that. Some may find this ratio weak and if they brew 10 cups they may not be happy about the lack of grinding room.\n\nI have never tried to make small pots of coffee, due to the thermal carafe keeping the coffee warm all day, and extraction efficiency usually being higher (from what I know) with larger batches. So maybe there are some issues in the 1-4 cup mode.\n\nNote: I always grind my coffee (home roast these days), and I always use the included gold filter. I do not know the result of not using the grinder or using standard paper filters. I don't use the timer, either, so I can't comment on how that works.\n\n(*) The thermal carafe really works well. Provided that you fill the thermal carafe with piping hot water from your faucet and use that to brew, it will keep coffee hot for several hours, without going into burnt territory. This is idea for me, it means I can brew a very large pot that will last the entire day if needed.\n\n(*) Ground coffee is messy. But I've never seen a case where it isn't. I've wondered how many of the reviewers have dealt with grinding beans before. Ground beans = oily gummy particles. I've personally found this an easy machine to clean for a raw bean machine. Most of the parts are dishwashable, and the fact that they seperate out makes it easy to scrub the raw oils off if you want. About the only parts I don't dishwash are the carafe itself (which I've found a good oxygen-based cleaner does well on if needed) and the gold filter. The machine itself only needs mild cleaning every now and then.\n\nCons:\n\n(*) The grinder is loud. Well, I haven't had a grinder that doesn't have high volume personally... but it's definitely something it would be nice to see more engineering on to quiet down.\n\n(*) There are a lot of parts to deal with. The part list may seem daunting: a grinder basket, grinder lid, coffee basket, coffee filter, coffee filter lid, carafe, carafe lid. All are necessary. If you combined a regular drip coffee maker and a regular grinder, you'd get roughly the same thing.  Still, one time, I brewed coffee while forgetting to put the gold basket in the machine. Result: coffee spewing out the basket and a wild mess. I do not mind the number of parts for the most part, because this allows for the dishwashable nature of the design; however it could be a problem for those who don't want to fiddle a lot to produce their cup.\n\n(*) The water tank is a bit hard to read as far as the numbers go.\n\n(*) Steam is allowed to come up and interact with the grinding chamber. This is more of a mess issue than anything else. The grinding chamber can become pretty sticky if you brew more than one batch without cleaning it up first. I don't do that, since (due to the thermal carafe) I can brew one large batch for the day and be done in most cases.\n\nConclusion: I tend to like this coffee maker on the grounds that it brews a very nice cup of coffee, nicer (in terms of clean-taste and allowing the subtleties of the lighter City+ style roasts coming through) than many of my older machines. And it is a lot less messy than my old system. I'm certain that there is a lot of room for improvement, as far as grind and brew designs go -- on this machine, the water tank and grinder location design could be improved. Plus, a bigger grinding chamber would satisfy the strong-coffee folks more.\n\nThis is definitely not a 1 star machine. It's very good for what it's claim to fame is. Maintenance wise, I've had no problems with this machine at all since I got it last year. It just takes a lot more to brew coffee than other machines. But to me, the coffee is much better than standard drip.\n\nMy only other thoughts are wondering how other grind and brews fare. The grind and brew from Capresso for instance seems to address a lot of the Cuisinart model's faults and although it costs more I would say it is definitely worth considering over the Cuisinart considering the reviews. The Melitta Mill and Brew might be an option, since it's a lot cheaper and supposedly easier to clean -- however the reviews seem to indicate much more mechanical issues, so it seems you get what you pay for in construction quality. I'm not aware of others. :)";Despite flaws, a good cup of coffee and good machine.
114;13.0;5.0;25.0;"I have used a combination grind and brew coffee maker for years. My previous model was a Capresso that has a bean resevoir and brews with little difficulty. The problem with it was that it really didn't extract all the flavor from the beans.\nThe Grind and Brew thermal from Cuisinart isn't as convenient, but it brews a wonderful cup of coffee. You do have to scoop the right amount of beans into the grinder, which is under the top lid, then you add water to the resevoir, also from the top. The built-in water level gauge is not easy to read, and the machine favors right-handed people.\nThe brew basket uses a gold filter (included) or #4 paper basket filters. I have been using the gold filter. The coffee brews directly into a stainless steel thermal carafe.\nCleanup is some work. The grinder always is wet inside after brewing, so it is necessary to remove it and wash it. The filter, if you use the gold one, must be washed too. Fortunately, Cuisinart has redesigned the Grind and Brew to make these jobs very easy. Parts are easy to remove and clean. The carafe is wide-mouthed, so cleaning is much easier than with narrow-mouthed carafes most of us have had in the past.\nSome of the disadvantages are actually good news. Since you manually measure beans into the grinder, you can easily control the strength of the coffee. Cuisinart has paid attention to the physics of making great coffee. There is a 2-4 cup button that makes sure the water is very hot from the first drop in the brewing basket. Most coffee makers send fairly cold water up in the beginning. When you make a small pot, there isn't enough hot water to properly extract flavor from the beans in other coffee makers.\nCuisinart also did a good job with their ""shower head"" that sprays water into the brew basket. The coffee grounds are uniformly wet.\nBottom line is that if you love good coffee, this pot brews it, even in as small an amount as 4 cups (don't try 2 cups, no coffee maker can really brew that little). Remember a ""cup"" is 6 ounces, and a typical mug holds 12 ounces of liquid. Cleanup takes about 2 minutes per pot. Not bad for this quality coffee.\nBuy good beans, keep the pot clean, and use the gold filter and you will be rewarded with a great cup of coffee. I am very happy with the Grind and Brew Thermal (DGB-600BC). The much more expensive Capresso version (usually around $199) makes a poor cup of coffee and the trade for a bit more convenience isn't worth it.";Not the most convenient, but a great cup of coffee
34;14.0;2.0;19.0;"After my beloved thermal Barrista (from Starbucks) died, I immediately went on a hunt for a new machine. I didn't have any particular brand in mind (although I knew I didn't want a Mr. Coffee), but I did have few major criteria. My new coffee maker absolutely had to:\n\n* have a thermal carafe.\n\n* be constructed durably enough to withstand near-constant use/abuse.\n\n* not have a hotplate.\n\n* have a pause-and-serve feature (the easiest criterion of the bunch as it seems to be standard nowadays).\n\nWhen I started shopping, I assumed it was my lucky day. Immediately upon entering the store, I spotted a Coffee Maker display standing proudly like an oasis. And immediately, the Cuisinart Grind & Brew caught my eye. I'm embarrassed to admit that I did absolutely no research on the machine before laying down $149.00 plus tax for this sleek and gorgeous sludge-making machine.\n\nYou see, this one stood proudly on a display next to other Cuisinart machines, in a section devoid of any other coffee makers. In retrospect, I feel cheap and manipulated: marketing geniuses successfully steered my purchase with product placement. At the time, I was giddy with the thrill of finding a coffee maker that not only seemed to meet my standards, but was also beautiful and caressed my fantasies of never having to clean grinder-dust from my counters again.\n\nI only briefly considered my previous self-declared ""all-in-one"" ban. I also remembered that I already own a perfectly good grinder or two and don't actually need another one. Still, I dismissed my objections,  signed the credit card slip, tucked the box under my arm, and away I went.\n\nThat was two days ago.\n\nLet The Buyer's Remorse Begin\n\nWith hands trembling in excitement (or coffee withdrawals, I'm not sure which), I unpacked the machine. A positive point: set-up was user-friendly and intuitive--basically. Although I never thought I'd say that about a coffee machine given that Mr. Coffee is truly plug-and-play (excuse the out-of-context references; I'm a computer geek by nature). I plugged it in, inserted the charcoal filter in its in-tank holder, discovered instantly where where the coffee beans go (not earth shattering--in the grinder perhaps?:)), poured the water in the tank, and hit ""start"".\n\nThe machine responded.\n\n""beep. beep. beep. beep.""\n\nI opened it up, peeked in at my beans and water and hit start again. Again the machine beeped a response. I stood patiently waiting for the grinding to begin, trying to convince myself that the beep was just to warn me it was about to start grinding. I was wrong.\n\nTo be fair to Cuisinart, this was a simple case of user error and I remembered the advice I gave my parents when they were pulling their hair out over some piece of new-fangled electronics: when all else fails, RTFM (read the friggen manual). I grabbed it and went to set it on the counter to read it. The manual helped, although not as expected. As I moved the grinder lid aside to clear counter space for the manual, I realized that the cap probably belonged on the grinder and not on the counter. Sure enough, lid in place, the machine stopped beeping.\n\nIn place of the beeps, the sound of a ice-cube filled blender, and one with dull blades and an overworked motor at that, invaded my kitchen. I ripped the plug out of the wall...I had to have done something wrong! I've been grinding my own beans for 15 years and I've never heard a grinder that loud!! I picked up the manual again and flipped through it. After being unable to find any troubleshooting advice to fix an insanely loud grinder, I plugged the machine in again and let it rip.\n\nNot only was the grinder loud, it went on grinding for an extraordinarily long time. Holy cow! I was sure this thing had ground my beans much too fine for a drip machine--but again, I was wrong. The grind was fine (although not at all adjustable), and the coffee began to brew.\n\nWhat's Right about this Machine\n\nIn an effort to highlight the good too, let me tell you that the coffee wasn't horrible. It wasn't the best coffee I've ever had, but it didn't make me gag either. It was a little weak, even using the maximum amount of beans the machine could hold, but that's probably because it took longer than optimal to brew and the coffee maker suffers from the same problem most drip machines suffer--the water wasn't hot enough when it began pouring over the grounds (no, I didn't actually stick a thermometer in it--that was just a guess). To be honest, the coffee isn't any better than a $14.99 Mr. Coffee could brew. Oh darn, I was supposed to be highlighting the positive.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nOkay, the thermal carafe. It was the only reason I chose this machine over the one right next to it (the Cuisinart Grind and Brew without the thermal carafe).\n\nSo was it worth the extra forty-nine bucks? Yeah, to be honest, probably. No hot plate, no burnt coffee. Sadly though, I have a few complaints about the carafe as well. It keeps the coffee warm enough for a four hours or so, and if it was the first of its type I'd tried, I'd be satisfied. But my only point of comparison is the aforementioned Barrista...and they don't compare. The Cuisinart thermal carafe is double insulated and probably kept the coffee warm for nearly as long as the Barrista keeps the coffee hot, but the lid construction stinks. The barrista lid is thick, thermos-like, and actually seals when not in use--the Cuisinart's carafe lid is flimsy plastic and I imagine the difference between hot and warm could come from heat escaping through the thin plastic and from the unsealed hole the brewing coffee is meant to enter into. And pouring coffee from this thing takes more effort than should be necessary. The pot has to be tipped almost 180 degrees and the coffee still doesn't actually pour--it tinkles out. I actually thought I was doing something wrong and that maybe the lid needed to be turned to the ""unlocked"" position to pour.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: IT DOESN'T. Pay attention--failure to heed this warning will result in coffee dumping in your cup, on the counter, down your pant leg, and all over your floor. Thankfully, unless freshly brewed, it won't be hot enough to burn you, but it still makes a mess. Turning the lid to the unlock position while pouring will....ummm...unlock the lid. That is, the lid will fall off. Now I know this seems like common sense, especially since that's how you turn the lid to take it off and fill it with coffee. But when you've been waiting not-so-patiently as you watch the coffee dribble out of the pot and into your cup, common sense sometimes escapes you and you look for troubleshooting options. Just learn from my mistake here.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nAbandoning all pretense of telling you what I like about this machine, I'll move onto my number one complaint. After the coffee is brewed, your grinder will be wet. Not just condensations--but dripping wet! The first time I saw it, I thought someone had poured the water over the beans instead of into the tank and I was looking suspiciously at my children (who are much to young to drink coffee or even try to make a pot!). Alas, they were innocent and the folks at Cuisinart were guilty. Although instructions directing you to wash the grinder thoroughly after after use are clearly printed on the lid of the grinder, I would have thought (had I thought much about it when I bought it) that after every other use would suffice. Maybe one day I could forget and it'd still be usable? But Nooooooo. Every use means every use. I'm just too lazy for this machine.\n\nAs a result, it's going back and I'll actually shop around before replacing it.";Eschew the Grind and Brew
65;15.0;4.0;19.0;"I bought this two years ago after rejecting the Melitta Grind N Brew. Seemingly impatient and negative people have left some harsh/unfair reviews, and seem pretty quick to judge, IMHO.\n\nThis is a GREAT Coffee maker/grinder solution for several reasons,with TWO caveats discussed below:\n\nJust about everything else about this machine has been perfect for 2 years!!\n\n-Reliable\n\n-Durable\n\n-Excellent tasting hot coffee for hours\n\n-1-4 cup extra heat a great idea.\n\n-Great looks\n\n-beeping when fully brewed great idea b/c no visual indication on caraffe.\n\n-No Burnt coffee with stainless steel caraffe, and also a safer design with no extra heat element to keep coffee warm.\n\n-Option to grind or not great for flexability of brewing.\n\n-You can also manually grind the night before if someone in household is sensitive to the grinder noise in the morning. [press the on button and then turn off after grinding]\n\nTwo Caveats:\n\n1. LIVE with the fact you should spend 1 minute rinsing the grinder lid, blade container and basket lid after each use. This prevents the buildup of grind sludge, which, left uncleaned will progressively build up more sludge; each time new grinds pass by old damp grinds a new layer is deposited, wasting coffee and robbing the potency of your brew. This is caused by steam radiating up from the brew basket back through the grinder.\n\nThis is EASILY AVOIDED with a rinse of hot tap water after brewing, then just replace and leave the top lid open on the machine and the grinder lid tilted up to air dry. If your anal, you can also wipe it clean with a paper towel.\n\nOR AT THE VERY LEAST, you should leave the machine lid open and grinder lid tilted up to air dry the grinder after brewing. This will slow buildup, and then just clean it once a week with your dishwasher or wash by hand.\n\n2. When you try to remove and clean the grinder, sometimes the grinder gets tough to remove from the hard rubber axle that spins the blade. This is easily remedied with a half-second squirt of non-stick cooking spray or dab of olive oil on the axle once every few months.\n\nDon't beleive the negative reviews. I am a coffee snob, and find this an excellent maker/grinder solution.";Overall a quality device and good buy-Long Term Owner
16;16.0;1.0;16.0;I received this coffeemaker as a gift about 18 months ago. It was a major pain to tear down and clean out every day...but I figured, hey, that's the price you pay for something so cool. After about a year it started to become more difficult to remove the grinder (which is necessary for cleaning both grinder and the little chute the ground coffee travels down). Now, as others have reported, it's irretrievably stuck. Out came the trusty old Braun grinder, and I'm back to grinding beans the night before and using the coffeemaker without the grinder. E-mailed Cuisinart and...not a word in reply. This is distressing as I own quite a lot of their stuff but will hesitate to buy more.\n\nUp side: This is the first unit I've had with a thermal carafe, and I'll never go back to glass. Especially if you preheat the carafe, coffee stays hot for ages, and hooray for no more skunky burned stuff, plus less worries about fire hazard.\n\nSo, Capresso, here I come! I've looked longingly at their unit with a built-in burr grinder, but after reading those reviews I've decided that it's better to keep the two tasks in separate units. Although I may lose out on some coffee-snob bragging rights by grinding the night before, in truth I can't taste much difference, if any.;No! Save yourself!
100;17.0;1.0;19.0;1. Opening the reservoir takes two thumbs and considerable force.\n\n2. A step-like water level indicator is down inside the reservoir and very difficult to read.\n\n3. The grinder fills with condensation and makes a gummy mess with the residue grinds.\n\n4.  The grinder has several pieces and is tedious to clean and dry.  You have to do so every time you use it.  I finally stopped using it and went back to a separate grinder.\n\n5.  The grinder sounds like a jet engine and seems to go on forever.\n\n6.  The carafe drips all over when you pour.\n\n7.  The coffee needs reheating after about a half hour. (I drink it black.)\n\nOther than that, it's great.  Looks good, too.;Where do I start?
0;18.0;1.0;20.0;"Have you noticed that the reviews here swing one way or the other? If you're used to Maxwell House coffee brewed in a Mr. Coffee, you'll love this machine -- if you're used to grinding your own beans (especially a full-bodied roast), you'll hate this machine.\nLet me list the symptoms that are a result of the many poor designs of this coffee maker:\n1) very weak coffee: it only has one grind -- large (if you try to add enough beans to compensate for the overly large grind, neither the grinder nor basket can conatain it)\n2) tipid to luke-warm coffee: even though this maker has a ""1-4"" cup button for making one to four cups to compensate for shortened brew cycle, the coffee is, at best, tipid. When you brew a full pot, it is warmer, but you better gulp it down because it turns to luke-warm while your drinking it.\n3) caraf doesn't pour -- it trickles and pours intermittenly: this is due to the opening being in the center of the self-sealing lid instead of the side and forces complete inversion.\n4) steam backs up into the grinding chamber: this forces you to wash and dry the grinder and griner lid immediately if you need to brew a second pot.\n5) uses out-dated basket shaped filters: all of the gormet coffee makers switched over to the cone shaped filters 10 years ago because they concentrate the brew properties towards the bottom of the cone and are more efficient requiring less coffee to be used.\nI have returned it and will keep my Braun burr coffee grinder and will purchase a programmable brewer that has a cone shaped filter and a warming plate with variable temp control.\nPlease stay away from this unit if you are used to rich, freshly ground coffee -- you will only be disapointed.\nThanks for reading and happy brewing!";Good idea -- Flawed design (Read the reality here)
139;19.0;2.0;19.0;This machine was a huge disappointment. I am amazed that it was brought to market with its signifcant engineering problems.  I returned it for the following reasons:\n  1: Steam- When you brew a pot, the ENTIRE machine- grinder, bean hopper, etc. fills with steam. The unground beans get wet, and the residual grinds turn to paste. It's a huge mess every time you make a pot.\n  2: Carafe- leaks. It is impossible to pour out the final 2 cups without spilling half on the counter.\n  3: Weak coffee- The grinder will only take enough beans to make about half a pot of decent coffee. If you use the max amount of beans and try to make a full pot, you get brown water.\n  4: There are a bunch of little plastic parts that you have to clean and replace every time you set it up.\nOn the plus side, it looks pretty cool and makes excellent coffee (in small amounts)- probably thanks to the charcoal water filter.;Major Design Flaws
46;20.0;5.0;15.0;I have owned this grind and brew coffee maker for just over 2 years now.  I have no complaints whatsoever i brew a minimum of 2 pots a day. If I have company sometimes 4 pots a day.  Does it have the potential to leak...yes it does. What causes the leaking.... not properly cleaning the unit or for most of the negative reviewers probably not cleaning it at all. If you brew coffee through this unit 1 pot or even 10 pots daily don't let it sit overnight before cleaning it, or clean it the next day before brewing again. Grinding coffee beans creats dust in the unit that adheres to the grinders screen and the port through which the hot water enters to mix with the ground coffee. This dust becomes wet due to hot water and steam. If you allow the coffee maker to sit a day without use, this bean dust solidifies and clogs the internal workins where the hot water needs to go. This is a professional grade machine that like at coffee houses needs cleaning on a daily basis. Cleaning takes all of 2 minutes a day simply pull out the grinder and rinse it off under running tap water, if your lazy you don't even have to dry it. Then pull out the filter holder and do the same. 2 minutes of cleaning a day is well worth it for fresh grind and brew coffee.;BE A LITTLE CLEANER PEOPLE
54;21.0;2.0;15.0;"Not only have I never written a review of a product before I wrote one about the Cuisinart Grind and Brew 7 months ago (see below), I now feel compelled to write an update after owning it for 8 months. It has now begun to leak from the bottom. What I find so distressing is that it could be the best machine out there with just a few improvements, but the flaws are so glaring that were it $30.00 I would not buy it again. My first review was fairly negative, however, I've had a while to use the machine. In all fairness, it makes a nice cup of coffee. However, I am having more and more trouble getting the coffee compartment to stay closed, it always leaks from the caraffe and now it is leaking from the bottom of the machine. I don't even think about using the grind feature anymore. You don't have to constantly clean a stand alone bean grinder. I'm not an engineer, but it seems to me that you could somehow separate the grinding compartment from the water compartment by just running the plastic up to the top of the machine or encasing the grind compartment so that the condensation didn't get to the grinder. Anyway, I honestly would think twice before purchasing this machine. My husband liked our old Mr. Coffee better for its consistency.\n\nI have never felt the urge to write a review until now.  There is nothing to add that other people have not said, however, this product has so disappointed me that I wanted to include another review to the list.  This morning was my husband's birthday.  The only thing he asked from me was, ""Will you get me a cup of coffee?""  Sure no problem, hah!!  I had done the ""clean every part thing"" and proceeded with getting everything ready.  I didn't overfill the water level and it overflowed, making a 20 minute clean up necessary.  We've had grounds in the coffee for no reason.  Normally I research before buying but didn't this time.  I decided to take a look and my husband and I just started laughing.  We thought there was something wrong with us that we couldn't get this thing to run properly.  You shouldn't have to spend so much time on clean up.  We joked that the good reviews had come from people who had made the coffee maker part of the family.  ""No, it's not too much trouble.  I wonder what old Cuisie wants for Christmas?""";Had to add my 2 cents
128;22.0;2.0;18.0;I waited a long time for this model to hit the market and despite many negative reviews, I still purchased it with great anticipation. As much as I tried to love it, the bottom line (for me anyway) is that it's a disappointment and I've decided to take it back for a refund.\nI only used the grinder a few times and then gave up on it because of the mess as well as the need to wash and dry thoroughly after each use.  The machine forms so much condensation during brewing that there are puddles of water left in the dry grinder cup (that I'm not even using) after the brew is complete.\nThe carafe does not keep the coffee hot for very long even though I pre-heat the carafe with hot water prior to brewing.\nLast complaint is that when pouring, a lot of coffee ends up on the counter.  As another reviewer stated, it happens more with the first pourings.  I've tried pouring slower and even taking the lid completely off, but to no avail.\nI do have one positive comment though... I love the way it looks!;BIG  Disappointment
44;23.0;1.0;14.0;I got this machine as a wedding shower gift and feel horrible that I am going to return it but I HATE IT.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and while I have not had any leaks or experienced the door popping open, the coffee simply is not warm enough.  I get up when I hear the grinder (how can you avoid hearing that???) and take a shower, dress, etc. and by the time I get to the kitchen, it's cold.  I found myself rushing through my morning routine to get to the coffee while it was hot - who's in charge here?  Finally last night after cleaning all the parts again (which was another dissapointment that it is more work than I expected, frankly), I finally chose to stop the madness and brought out my old Hamilton-Beech.  This morning?  Hot coffee all morning.  Back to the store for the Cuisinart!;Total waste of money and never hot enough
45;24.0;4.0;14.0;Have never written a review before but after reading all the reviews here had to add mine. The first one I had the filter drawer popped open during grinding. The first time it happened I pushed the button and went into the other room. Came back for my nice fresh cup of coffee and the ground beans were everywhere as well as the water. Boy that's not fun at 6am. So after that I stayed there for the first few seconds of grinding and when it happened again for the third time in 3 weeks I brought it back and the second one has not done this to date. I read one review that someone uses duct tape to hold the drawer in, not sure why she does not return it and get another as that is not normal. After reading all these reviews I found the solution to my second problem. The gooey residue that gets under the grinder and gets in many places. I have read the steam is causing this and to open top after grinding. I think I will pull out the grinder as well as it is not needed after that point. I thought there was a washer or something missing from the bottom part of the grinder. I will give it a try tomorrow AM. I also get grinds in my coffe, not allot but a few.\n\nOk, now with those problems I still give it a 4 because the coffee is so damn good. I have had grind and brews for 5-6 years so am used to washing all the parts, no big deal. It takes all of a minute. I do it in the morning and leave all pieces upside down in the dish strainer. The other issue I read is the temperature of the coffee. I get up early (and don't have to work in the winter) so I have 3 cups over 3 hours. The first two cups are plenty hot enough but after 2 hours when I pour the third cup I have to zap it for 20 seconds to get it back to hot enough.;coffee tastes great
55;25.0;1.0;14.0;Word of advice - NEVER NEVER get  rid of your old faithful coffee machine until you've really tested out the new one......This  model sadly just does not measure up the price and aesthetic  look of the machine - The grinder is so loud  it's like a wake up alarm for the whole house - the grinder is not easy to clean -  for a thermal  pot the coffee  doesnt stay  THAT warm., and when you do pour the coffee its painstakingly slow and no matter how careful you are it makes a mess everywhere....shame as cuisinart are normally very good - if you don't mind grinding your coffee at the supermarket then do that and stick with the previous cuisinart model.;Waste of money - sorry cuisinart :(
92;26.0;3.0;15.0;We love coffee, and love it fresh. So when this maker came out a few years back it was an obvious purchase.  But I have only been partially satisfied and would recommend either purchasing it much cheaper than the outrageous list price, or shopping around for another brand.  I will simplify my review in bullet points.\n\n1) APPEARANCE: The most attactive feature. The brushed steel on black is really cool and will blend well with the highline accessories that will likely be in a kitchen with this product.\n2) SIZE: Very big. It is too tall to fit on our counter under the cabinets so it sits precariously near the edge waiting for one of our kids to knock it over.\n3) EASE OF USE: This is the big negative. After owning this product and buying whole bean coffee for about 3 months, we have since gone back to buying pre-ground coffee because this machine is simply too difficult and too time-consuming to clean. There are 5 parts that need to be cleaned after each use and it is a pain in the neck. I would say that including cleaning the machine, preparing it for use takes a good 10 minutes - I honestly could do it more quickly and with less mess with a simple brewer and grinder.\n4) CRAFTSMANSHIP: Big dissappointment here as Cuisinart is generally known for high quality.  a:The spring loaded tray that holds the coffee filter broke after about 3 months and now needs to be pulled open manually.  b:The filter tray itself has three different cracks in it and I have yet to drop it.  c: I have to hold a napkin under the carafe when I am pouring water into the machine as the water runs down the side of the carafe.  d: the carafe itself is great and holds coffee warm for 4-5 hours if you brew a full pot.\n5) OVERALL: Great idea which is not designed and built very well. Keep looking and read reviews on the other brands before you take the plunge. If you could find this one used for about $50-60 I would think you would be getting a good deal from the standpoint of appearance and the quality of the carafe, otherwise go with another brand.;High Expectations, Mediocre Results
103;27.0;5.0;15.0;"I've had my DGB-600BC for over a year and use it almost every morning.  I find that it makes excellent coffee (using a blend of 50% french roast and 50% medium roast beans) that stays hot for several hours.  There are a few points I'd like to dispute from some of the negative reviews:\n\n1.  The coffee isn't strong enough:  it must be something about the beans used, the quantity of coffee brewed or the palette of the drinker (I've never found a drip coffee maker that will make super strong coffee).  When making fewer than 5 cups, use the cycle extender, which will hold the water in the grounds for a longer period of time and strengthen the brew.  We were out of our medium beans yesterday, so we made a full pot of French Roast.  It was too strong to drink!\n\n2.  The coffee isn't hot enough:  user error should be considered, although it is possible to have a bad heating element.  Remember, this is a THERMAL carafe.  If the last thing in the carafe was cold water, the inside will be COLD, and you'll lower the temperature of the brewed coffee.  Warm the carafe with HOT water before starting the brew cycle or setting the pot up to turn on automatically.  We make coffee at 8 am or so on weekends, and it's still steaming hot when we pour the last cup two hours later.\n\n3.  The grinder is too loud:  well, I must say that the first (and last) morning I used the timer function, the grinder woke me up.  It also scared the daylights out of my cat, who was sleeping on the counter next to it (it was a bonus that it broke the cat of his counter sitting habit).  In reality, I don't think it's louder than any other grinder; it's just that it's a startling noise first thing in the morning.  We've decided that we don't really need the timer function, but if you do and if your bedroom is near the kitchen, you may want to close your bedroom door at night or set it up the night before and push the ""on"" button as soon as you get up.\n\n4.  It's too hard to clean:  There are 7 components of the pot to clean -- the two piece grinder; the basket, insert and lid; and the pot and its lid.  That's three more parts than the standard coffee maker.  It's true that the grinder must be rinsed after each use, as steam from the brewing coffee makes any bean residue in the basket clump, and I tend to at least rinse all the pieces well after each pot if I don't thoroughly wash them.  Compared to grinding beans separetely (where the grinder doesn't have to be cleaned every time it's used), you're probably looking at 1 minute of extra effort a day.  On the other hand, you don't have to wait while the coffee beans are ground, then transfer them to the coffee maker ... so it probably doesn't take any additional time at all to clean and dry the grinder and basket lid.  One lesson I've learned is that it is CRUCIAL that 3 pieces -- the two pieces of the grinder and the lid of the basker -- be BONE DRY when the pot is reassembled for brewing.  If the beans get wet while being ground or sliding down the chute into the basket, you will have a clumpy mess on your hands.  The other pieces don't require the same rigorous drying (I've even left the basket unrinsed between pots).\n\nOverall, if you are not looking to make ""stand your spoon up in it"" strength coffee, don't mind making sure the necessary pieces are dry, can remember to rinse the pot with hot water before brewing and can tolerate the sound of an average bean grinder, you'll find this Cuisinart gem makes good-flavored, hot, fresh coffee.  If any of these is something you don't want to do, you may want to look at other coffee makers or perhaps an espresso machine.";Best Coffeemaker I've Ever Had
71;28.0;5.0;14.0;This machine is the best coffee maker I've owned or used.  What I appreciate about it is the modular design of the major components, including the filter basket and grinding container.  This allows me to quickly clean it between uses.\n\nFeatures that I greatly appreciate:\n- You are not restricted to using beans. There is a button on the front panel that stops the grinder from activating when you are using ground coffee.\n\n- Unlike other coffee makes that develop leaks, the valve on the bottom of the filter holder has a large stopper and heavy spring that will prevent any leaking if you follow the instructions and keep the filter holder clean.  A small amount of coffee grounds, especially fine grounds,will prevent the valve fron seating.  More importantly, NEVER put the filter holder in a dishwasher because the heat can destroy the stopper.\n\n- The gold, permanent filter that comes with this machine is a nice way to save money on filters.\n\n- Water filter cartridges used in this machine assure a great cup of coffee even if your water quality is questionable.\n\nIn addition to the features mentioned above a few other things I like about this maker include: consistently excellent coffee, high quality construction, and asthetics.\n\nThe only gripe I do have - and it's minor - is the thermal carafe does not seem to keep the coffee piping hot for more than a few hours.\n\nOverall, I am thoroughly pleased with this maker and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a high-quality coffee maker with excellent features.;Absolutely wonderful
83;29.0;1.0;14.0;"About a year ago I purchased one of these. It look good and I really liked the idea of a 'grind and brew' system. I figured it would save me a step or two in the whole coffee making process.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe system has several problems;\n(1) The grinder tends to collect steam after each pot of coffee. The steam condenses and then mixes with the remaining coffee grounds and will gum up the screen that allows the coffee to pass down to the filter basket. The grinder has to be cleaned after every cup of coffee.\n(2) The filter swings out at the touch of a button. This was a nice little feature at first, but then the latch wore out and now the basket has to be held in place or it will pop out when the freshly ground coffee hits it. Usually, this is enough to cause the carafe to fill up with coffee grounds and the plastic filter piece to fill up and then leak over the side. Something you really don't want to see first thing in the morning.\n(3) The top of the carafe tends to get gummed up with the finer coffee grounds. This causes the carafe itself to leak (see afore mentioned comment on leaking and first thing in the morning).\n(4) So, the unit requires a great deal of cleaning. You have to take the grinder out, the filter basket and filter out, the carafe and its lid out and soap them all up and clean them. While you're doing this, if you inadvertently hit any one of the 5 buttons on the coffee maker, it will beep until you replace all the components or unplug it. If you unplug it, then you have to go through and reset both the clock and the programmable start time. Annoying and enough to want to roof test the unit all together.\n(5) The carafe itself leaks like a sieve when you pour coffee. No matter how slow or fast you pour, coffee leaks out the spout and down the carafe.\nAll in all, I would avoid the 'grind and brew' systems just because of the number of components that have to be kept clean for the system to work.\n\nNow, I just have to find a replacement system.";It seemed like a good idea
15;30.0;3.0;11.0;We registered for this coffee maker as a wedding gift based on a family member's recognition. Though it makes good coffee, and is easy and convenient to set up, it is very difficult to clean. You are supposed to clean the grinder after each use, and I find that coffee grinds easily get in nooks and crannies you wouldn't think they would. If I realized how time consuming this would be to clean, I would have registered for a separate coffe maker and grinder.;Just okay
23;31.0;2.0;11.0;I'll try and add something new and objective to the multitude of reviews already listed here.  I got this machine a week ago for cheap, so I really wanted to like it.  However, the coffee it made never tasted right.  It was bitter, but had no fullness to it regardless of how I adjusted the bean to water ratio.  I decided to do a comparison with an old braun 4-cup aromamaster I had laying aroud.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 4 cups of britta-filtered water and the same volume of green mountain sumatran reserve beans. For the braun, I ground the beans in a krups grinder first, while for the cuisinart I just added the beans.  In both cases I brewed the coffee using paper filters (braun takes cone filters and cuisinart basket filter, however I used the same brand).  In the case of the cuisinart I also used the 1-4 cup setting and pre-warmed the pot.  I did not insert the charcoal filter since I was already using filtered water.\nRESULTS:\nBREW TIME:  Cuisinart ground and brewed coffee in the same time the Braun just brewed it.\nTEMP:  Immediately post-brew there was no difference in temperature.\nOPACITY:  equal amounts of coffee from each maker were compared side-by side in clear glasses.  While the Braun produced dark-brown to black coffee, the Cuisinart's brew was a normal to light brown.  If I had the equipment to measure light transmission through both liquids I would estimate the Cuisinart brew to let twice as much light through as the Braun brew.\nTASTE (SUBJECTIVE): Both brews were equally as bitter, but I felt the Braun brew had a much fuller (better) overall flavor.\n\nCONCLUSION: The Braun coffee maker was able to extract flavor from the coffee beans much more efficiently than the Cuisinart machine.\n\nOVERALL REVIEW OF MACHINE:\n\nPROs: The Cuisinart DGB-600BC is a beautiful machine, it makes a separate grinder unecessary, and the thermal caraffee does its job nicely.  Other pluses include the programability, and build quality.\n\nCONs:  Biggest negative is the afforementioned poor coffee strength to bean ratio.  I'm sure with the proper adjustment you can get a good cup of coffee out of the cuisinart machine, but you will likely be using (and paying for) twice as many beans as an other machine.  I would also have to agree with other reviewers who complain that neither the grinder unit nor the grounds basket are large enough to brew a full 10 cups of strong coffee.  Finally, it takes just as long or longer to dry the grinder unit between brewing pots of coffee as it does to grind the beans separately, which makes me wonder what the benefit of this machine really is.\n\nNON-ISSUES (things other people had problems with that I did not): price of machine, pour speed, machine malfunctions, coffee not staying warm\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  All else aside, the primary job of a coffee maker is to brew a good cup of coffee as efficiently as possible & this is precisely where the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew fails.  Look elswhere.;Poor coffee strength to bean ratio
77;32.0;5.0;13.0;Let me start just by saying that, for the money, this unit makes a great cup of coffee.  I would like to give my opinion on some of the other negatives aspects which other people have given this unit in their reviews.  Does the grinding system make noise?  Yes, but it is not what I consider loud, and I have yet to find a coffee grinder which is completely silent!  Is the unit made of plastic with an outer stainless steel sheel, or faceplate?  Yes, but with the price of metal these days (I work in that industry), this unit would be unaffordable to the average buyer if Cuisinart made it all metal.  It is a sturdy unit with good looks!  Does the steam stay in the unit and make cleaning difficult?  Yes, but if Cuisinart made the steam escape, consumers would complain that the steam condenses on their cabinets.  It is not difficult to clean.  You pull all the parts (4 total) out and run them under hot water and then wipe down the inside with a paper towel.  Is the unit too tall to fit under cabinets when opened?  Yes, but you only have the unit open to get it ready to brew or clean out.  Once it's running or for storage, it fits perfectly on the counter.  Finally, does the carafe pour slowly?  Yes, but I'll take that negative since the coffee stays hot and doesn't overcook sitting on a standard hot pad.  I will end with saying that this compact, good-looking grind and brew until is very well worth the money.  It filters your water, grinds fresh beans and keeps your coffee hot for hours after brewing.  The unit can be programed and has a nice safety feature which will not start the brewing process unless all the parts are properly assembled.  Here's to Cuisinart...cheers!;Just a Plain-o Good Cup of Coffee
47;33.0;1.0;12.0;This machine is a great disappointment.  The Grind & Brew concept is a design failure.  As stated in another review, this machine requires extensive cleaning of 5 or 6 parts much more frequently than other coffee makers.  The design flaw is that the grinder is filled with steam on every brewing, caking the grinds in every nook and cranny and requiring messy cleaning after every brew.;Don't be fooled
12;34.0;1.0;10.0;"I wish I had.. Listened, that is. Now I've got to get this big box to a post office, because it's going right back.\n\nI didn't want to believe all of the complaints here.  I thought I'd deal with the tough clean up and just enjoy such a great looking piece of machinery.  Well, there's no doubt about it.  Cuisinart has truly goofed with this machine that simply doesn't do what it's buyers bought it for. Make good coffee.\n\nFirst of all, the directions seem to have been written by someone who was in a rush. They're vague, at best. I made myself slow down, re-read, focus.  Still a blur.  Still, that's not a reason to return a coffee maker.\n\nThe grinder wakes the dead. That doesn't bother me, (Well, I didn't think it would, but the truth of the matter is, as loud as you think it's gonna be, it's WORSE) but not a reason for me to return the coffee maker.  I should get up earlier anyway.\n\nCleaning this is like a logic problem from the LSAT exam.  Just as all of the reviews said, but I guess I didn't believe it would be so bad, because afterall, it IS Cuisinart. It is that bad.  Grinds get in every possible crevice that has to be removed, piece after piece after piece.  I'm too much of a slob to look after so many pieces and clean them all with Q-Tip precision. As much as I tried to get some of the wet, stuck to every corner gunk out, (Including with a toothpick after all else failed) it wouldn't budge.  Still, I wouldn't return the coffee maker for this.\nNow here's why I'm returning it:  Really bad coffee.  Here you have it:\n\nThe coffee isn't hot. I don't like scalding hot coffee, I hate it as a matter of fact. But to spend a bill and a half (that's $150.00) on a machine that makes luke-warm coffee that it professes to ""keep HOT all day"" is baloney.  No bones about it, the coffee was luke warm. No, I didn't ""warm up the carafe"" (the instructions reccomend that you do so if you want hot coffee by rinsing the carafe out with hot water first. Which would defeat the self timer feature...the box doesn't mention that, does it..)  I'd pre-set it the night before. But it didn't go on by itself anyway as I'd pre-set it to, so I started it up without heating the carafe; No one should have to ""heat up"" a carafe for a coffee maker that costs this much anyway.  Luke-warm coffee, now that's a reason to return this piece of junk.\n\nLastly and most importantly to me:  Weak coffee.  I had read that complaint several times on the board, so I had prepared:  I put in seven scoops for 5 cups.  WEAK coffee.  And the grinder, which has a ""bean maximum"" point, could barely hold seven scoops of beans. So how would it have made the ten cups it's supposed to?\n\nSo, in lieu of getting anymore upset about this defective product, I'm sending it back tomorrow.\n\nListen to me.  I should have listened to everyone else.\n\n12/29/06 Just wanted to add that the BUNN NHBX I purchased to replace this is fantastic! Strong, hot coffee in a simple, attractive machine.";LISTEN to those bad reviews..
37;35.0;3.0;11.0;Coffee is serious biz at our house, we roast our own beans and carefully test and select varietals. After careful research regarding the optimal temperature and methods of brewing we selected this machine. It almost got returned the next day when the grinder downstairs in the kitchen echoed off the walls upstairs like a friggin jet plane winding up for take-off. The lack of an adjustable grind setting means you are stuck with the pre-set grind. Everyones taste is different and a coarser grind makes a weaker pot, but too fine a grind can make it bitter, so what happens if you don't like the pre-set grind? Luckily we can compensate by adding more beans than usual but grind control would be nice. Also, we have used this machine for about two months and the control panel seemed dead the other morning, fine yesterday, then dead again this morning - had to unplug to reset, then works fine, but still cause for concern.\n\nWater temp is fine, right around the optimal 200 degrees, carafe design is smart (no burner to continue to cook the coffee)and keeps coffee for hours. Clean up is not hard unless you are inpatient, honestly if you quibble over having to clean a pot then go buy your morning cup.\n\nBottom line - it does what it is supposed to do very well (all in one coffee brewer), but there are some ancillary issues that would really help make this worth what they charge for it.\n\nIf I spend that kind of money on the convenience of a drip brewer I'll go with a far superior Technivorm, otherwise I'll go with a much cheaper french press which gives more control and outstanding results but sadly no timer.\n\n~Good luck;Mixed feelings from a coffee fanatic
117;36.0;2.0;13.0;"Maybe I had set the (coffee) bar too high, but I was disappointed with this product, and am returning it within one week of purchase.\nProblems:\n--Coffee was fairly weak, not robust or flavorful.  Of course, I was using the same beans/grind/number of scoops I'd been using previously with an older Braun unit.\n--May just have been the unit I got, but the coffee was simply not hot enough.  I tested a full carafe with water only, and immediately after the brewing process the temperature was an unsatisfactory 170F.\n--Emptying the carafe of its contents requires turning it almost completely ""head over heels.""  It's far from a simple pour to get the coffee out.  This problem in particular can lead to easy spillage.\n--Even if you don't use the grinder, the compartment will fill with condensation every time you use the unit, requiring that you dry the grinder components even though they were unused.\n--Unit is unusually large (partially owing to the grinder components), and did not fit in our appliance garage.\nAll in all, not what I'd expected or hoped for from Cuisinart.  I'm moving on to try the Capresso MT500.";A Big Disappointment
17;37.0;2.0;10.0;"The grinding mechanism is very loud and it will serve as an alarm clock as well. As everyone else has mentioned, it's very time consuming to take apart and clean each time. This maker, which was replaced by Cuisinart in March, has started cutting off just like the other two. The unit will beep after 2-3 minutes as if it is finished. It will eventually brew a pot of coffee if you start it at least 45 minutes prior to when you want it.  We've contacted Cuisinart about this, paid the $10.00 shipping fee each time and have received 2 replacement coffee makers over the past 3 years. Changing the charcoal filter and decalcifying with vinegar has no bearing on the problem. I suspect that Cuisinart is shipping out reconditioned units each time. It's getting rather annoying and I definitely would not recommend this machine. However, it does brew great coffee if you can wait long enough and put up with the aggravation. This was a gift and my sister who has the same has been using hers for years without any difficulty at all. However, we're considering other ""brew and grind"" options.";Grinder is like the Space Shuttle taking off
50;38.0;1.0;11.0;If your idea of a good time is to spend an hour cleaning coffee grounds out of EVERYTHING after every pot is brewed, go ahead and buy this little beauty.  On the other hand, if you like coffee that doesn't contain 6 parts grounds to every cup of drinkable coffee, a coffee maker that doesn't have to be completely disassembled, steam cleaned, and reassembled with each use, a coffee maker that doesn't sound like a jet has just landed in the kitchen ... well, then, my friend ... keep looking.  This machine deserves a class action suit.  But, since that takes too much time, I just threw mine in the trash --- don't even bother to recycle.;Don't  even THINK about buying this piece of junk!
97;39.0;1.0;12.0;I think one has to be skeptical about some of the good reviews on this machine.  Every time a negative review is posted, two or thee positive reviews pop up from reviewers who have never reviewed before on Amazon.  Please notice that the  negative reviews all corroborate each other and my experience was identical to what those reviwers said: weak coffee, complicated cleanup, loud grinder, quickly-cooling carafe, etc.  Some of the things might be forgiveable if this thing made good coffee. I tried everything to get a full-bodied brew before I returned the unit: different beans, doubling up on the amount of beans, bypassing the grinder, etc.  Nothing worked.  This is a badly designed unit.  I went back to my old $15 Mr. Coffee and it makes much better coffee.  The only good thing about the Cuisinart is that it looks nice. Beware if you are a real lover of coffee.;Not a good product -  Read Good Reviews Skeptically
36;40.0;1.0;10.0;Yes it looks good. We bought one for our conference room in our office, thinking that clients would appreciate the nice-looking coffee machine.\n\nUnfortunately, the machine is very poorly designed. After setting it up, we poured coffee into the grinder, and it ground away. And away. And away. You see, it doesn't stop automatically, or ever, apparently. So, we turned off the machine. Then you turn it BACK ON to actually make the coffee.\n\nThe manual states that if you want 'hot coffee' you should run hot water into the carafe for a while before you make coffee. This is idiotic... every time you make coffee you have to make two trips to the water supply, then turn the machine on and off TWICE.\n\nTo make matters worse, the insides of the machine get splattered with coffee grounds. This was after TWO USES. And, water condenses inside the coffee bean holder, which means the grinder is grinding wet beans, unless of course you clean and dry the insides between every pot of coffee.\n\nRoasting my own beans and grinding them with a hand-operated mill and then making coffee in a French Press is easier.\n\nDid I mention that the coffee didn't taste good? And I used just-roasted Peet's House Blend so it wasn't the fault of the beans.\n\nGet something else. I suspect the positive reviews are written by Cuisinart employees.;Do Not Purchase!
42;41.0;5.0;10.0;This machine (the Thermal Caraffe version) is good at two things- making fresh coffee, and keeping the coffee hot. It requires a little more cleaning, as people point out, but you can brew a pot at 7am, and it will still be 120 degrees when you get home from work that night (I've tested it). I've owned it for 2 years and have never had a problem with it leaking/clogging/anything.;Great, hot coffee all day
127;42.0;2.0;12.0;Let me start off my saying i am a coffee snob, and have never made coffee before in my own house because I'm a Starbucks addict and don't trust myself to make good coffee. But I'm tired of running out every time I want some coffee. Ok, here goes: I bought this coffee maker because of the features, and the looks. Most coffee makers look kind of boring, right? But not this beauty - really adds flare to the kitchen. The problem with this sucker is that the coffee DOES NOT STAY HOT for very long. Beyond the first cup, the rest is luke warm, and within a half hour, you'll need to be nuking you coffee to make it hot again. PLUS, if you are looking for a low maintenance machine, this isn't for you. It's a pain to clean every morning because of all the pieces. And the coffee had a very 'metallic' taste to it I could never get used to or figure out. I tried many different things - switching from the gold filter to paper, different kinds of coffee. But no luck. This stuff tastes wierd. After about a week, I returned it and will be continuing my daily trek to Starbucks thankyouverymuch.;Weird flavor and coffee gets cold fast!
57;43.0;2.0;10.0;"I have two major complaints about this product.  Firstly, the grinder is ""preset to a medium grind"".  Well, I found it to be much coarser than the way I do it in my grinder so I have to use almost twice as many beans to get the same strength brew.  At $11.99 per pound, that is not a good thing so I now disable the grind function and do it myself just like before.  Secondly, the coffee doesn't get hot enough, even when using the heat-boosting ""1-4 Cup"" button.  I have $150 coffeemaker and yet I grind my own beans and then have to microwave my coffee before drinking it.  Thumbs down.";Look elsewhere
59;44.0;5.0;10.0;I've read so many negative reviews, but I have found this coffee maker to be wonderful. Every morning I have fresh piping hot coffee waiting for me when I get up.  Even 4 hours later, the coffee is still hot, and still fresh tasting, since there is no heated burner.\n\nYes, the grinder is loud (but I can't hear it since the coffee maker is downstairs).  My handheld grinder is just as loud - that's what you have to experience if you're going to have freshly ground beans.  And yes, there are parts to clean - I either put the parts in the dishwasher, or give them a quick rinse before I set up the coffee for the morning.\n\nBottom line is I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a coffee maker that grinds the beans!!;I love this coffee maker!!!
63;45.0;1.0;10.0;We were happy with this machine at first.  Then we started having a problem where the coffee would overflow and spill all over the counter.  We returned the coffee maker and got a new one.  About 6 months later we had the same problem with the new one.  We're done with this model.;Problems
105;46.0;5.0;11.0;"Beware: Although this coffeemaker is capable of making great coffee consistently, the user must possess some intelligence beyond a moron. Buy this coffeemaker if you like to bring good coffee with you to work in the morning, but you don't have time to grind beans and wait for the coffeemaker to brew. Everyone acknowledges that grinding whole beans is a key step to making great coffee. However, if you grind it the night before when setting up the coffeemaker on a timer, you're giving up the benefit of fresh-ground beans, which will oxidize much faster than whole beans while sitting in the coffemaker overnight.\n\n For morons who couldn't get this coffeemaker to work right, here's some advice from somebody who has been using it successfully for 1.5 years now:\n\n 1. Don't over-fill the grinder. (The directions clearly state this.) This is why you're getting half-ground beans into your filter basket.\n\n 2. Install the filter basket properly (i.e. with the lift-handle away from the grinder) (Again, directions state this.) If you're using paper like me, make sure the paper is not folded over. This is why you're getting coffee spillage out of the machine.\n\n 3. Yes, this machine is more dificult to clean than other machines. That's because other machines don't include a grinder. But a standalone grinder would require cleaning too. And if you clean-up immediately after use (i.e. don't wait days to clean), it only takes 3 minutes to rinse the components and clean the machine with a paper towel. Trust me--I've timed it.\n\n 4. Yes, the stainless steel carafe does pour differently than other carafes. That's because it's an airtight carafe that has a ""flapper"" valve mechanism inside the carafe lid that keeps outside air from spoiling the coffee. The flapper valve works by gravity: When you tilt the carafe, the valve swings open allowing the coffee to pour. It's not hard to ""master"" the art of pouring. It requires a little bit of hand-eye coordination, and I've never spilled a drop after the first few tries.\n\n 5. I've never had a problem with coffee that was too cold. Maybe I have a sensitive mouth or something, or maybe I got a good unit.";Great Coffeemaker...but only if you're IQ is > 100
28;47.0;1.0;9.0;I was so excited to get this home, looks pretty cool, a few friends have commented on that, I wanted the thermal carafe, but from the first pot I was so disappointed.  Bought in 2005, I thought in this day and age that the logistics of a pot that doesnt drip all over the counter when you pour have been worked out already - long ago.  You have to TRY to get this wrong at this point. Cuisinart, I expected more from you.\n\nTo spend this much money and have to wipe the counter every time I pour a cup, or pour over the sink, is beyond ridiculous.\n\nBut thats not the worst part, the unit started to leak water from, somewhere.  Not the pot because it was plain water, sitting under the plugged in unit while it brewed.  So Im thinking, electrical appliance + puddle of water, hum , this isn't good.\n\nAnother reviewer pointed out the grinder INside the water reservoir area - I echo the absurdity of this design.  The condensation has to be wiped out every time or , Im afraid, mold will develope, but also makes a coffee bean muck to clean.\n\nTo grind fresh beans in this moist environment is more trouble then its worth- use a seperate grinder.\n\nThe design flaws make it clear was not just poorly thought out , but just plain sloppy and irresponsible.\n\nshame on you cuisinart.\n\nMy recommendation DO NOT spend the money on this.;cuisinart, this is the best you can do????
33;48.0;1.0;9.0;After convincing a new boss that freshly ground coffee beans makes a better tasting coffee, I purchased this Cuisinart Grind & Brew machine. The machine does grind coffee very well (although loud), but not all the grounds are deposited into the drip basket - thus making the coffee on the weak side. I thought it was just the one machine - returned it to the place of purchase for a new one - but it's the same. I wouldn't recommend this machine - I now need to grind the beans, open the grinder and physically remove the ground coffee to deposit into the drip basket - more hassle than anything!;Looks nice, doesn't make good coffee
43;49.0;3.0;9.0;We really enjoyed this at first. But after 1 year I've had it! It has backed up and spilled all over the floors and counters for the last time. Yes like others have stated before me, it's fine if you don't mind cleaning, drying, and replacing the multiple components after each use, because steam from brewing goes up and fills the chamber that grinds the coffee leaving behind a wet mess. But it's just too much work @ 6am. :(;Tired of all the cleaning......
6;50.0;1.0;7.0;- The coffee grinder sounds like a siren going off, if you use the grinder option (which you won't, as I'll explain in a minute).\n - You can't fit enough beans in the grinder to make more than 6 cups of reasonably strong coffee, which ends up only being 2 good sized mugs.\n - When you grind, the coffee gets thrown all over the inside of the grinder and the tube leading to the filter, which then becomes saturated as the steam from the water condenses everywhere.\n - As a result of the above, you literally have to clean out the entire inside of the grinding tube.\n - So if you grind, you end up washing the grinder cover, the tube to the filter, the filter cover, the filter itself (if you use the gold filter), the filter holder itself, and of course the carafe itself.  You will get tired of this in a big, big hurry.  Hence, you won't use the grinder.\n - So you end up not grinding....but you still have a pretty mediocre coffee maker.  You can put a bit more ground coffee into the filter (my guess is you'll end up using paper filters), but if you try to make a full pot of strong coffee it'll clog and run all over the counter and the inside where the carafe sits.  And it's a pain in the neck to try to clean inside there.  This coffee maker clogs and overflows more than any I've ever used.\n\nTruly, this is just a disaster of a coffee maker.  Many, many other choices for less money that work far better.;Not worth it - read the reviews
58;51.0;1.0;9.0;"I could have gotten less hassle with a $40 coffee pot. This thing is a pain to clean. After you grind the coffee the moisture rises and goes into the grinder so the grinds that are left get wet and stick to the inside of the grinder. It also drips from the bottom of the pot when you pour due to excess steam after brewing. the water drips down behind the pot onto the hotplate. also the coffee starts to cool down after about an hour in the ""thermal carafe"" We paid $135 for this. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. Run from this product.";Not worth the money at all !!!
7;52.0;5.0;7.0;After reading some of the reviews on this coffee maker I was a bit nervous about purchasing it.  I went ahead and bought it anyway and I am SO glad I did.  This is, without a doubt, the absolute best coffee maker I have ever owned.  If you are a true coffee lover and the taste of coffee really matters to you, this is the coffee maker for you. This coffee maker has every feature you could possibly want.  Other reviewers have said there are a lot of parts that have to be cleaned - this is true, but that doesn't matter to me as the taste of the coffee is absolutely superb.  Other reviewers have complained about the noise of the coffee grinder - c'mon folks, it's a coffee grinder, it's not supposed to be quiet.  I've never owned a quiet coffee grinder.  Other reviewers have complained about the way the coffee maker beeps if you don't assemble it correctly.  Be glad that it does.  The coffee maker must be assembled correctly to work properly.  When it beeps, just take a look at the way it's assembled.  It's not hard to see where you went wrong.  If the taste of your coffee matters to you, this is the coffee maker for you.  If you could care less about the taste of your coffee, then purchase a Mr. Coffee.  All I know is that I don't have to stop at Starbuck's anymore as my coffee from home is now the best.;This Is Absolutely The BEST Coffee Maker I Have Ever Owned
68;53.0;5.0;9.0;After carefully sorting through the good and bad reviews and weighing each in turn, I decided to buy this product about 4 months ago. So far, I have been very pleased with the ease of use of the Grind and Brew. I have also found nothing wrong with the coffee's taste, contrary to the comments of other reviewers.  As an added benefit, the unit is aesthetically pleasing.\n\nTo be sure, the item requires some extra attention. It can misbehave if not set up properly. You cannot overfill the bean container. You must also break down and clean each of the parts daily.\n\nI had only one instance where the filter basket overflowed, which happened because I overfilled the coffee bean container. It is just large enough to brew a full pot of coffee, so do not expect to use this product to make ridiculously strong, bitter coffee: buy an espresso machine or go to a coffee house if that's your thing.\n\nAs for cleaning, yes the removable parts must be cleaned daily. It's true that the steam turns the coffee grounds in the bean container into mush. But a rinse of water, some scrubbing with a brush, followed up with a quick wipe down is all you need to prepare for the next pot.\n\nThe most surprising feature has been the stainless steel carafe. Although the coffee is never piping hot even immediately after brewing, it's adequately warm and drinkable for at least 4 hours.\n\nAll in all, this is a great product. I hope that you will be as happy with it as I am.;A great item...but  you must follow the instructions
72;54.0;1.0;9.0;"UPDATE:  Last month (January), the machine began to stop without pumping all the water through.  I now have to check to see the water level, turn off ""grind"", and hit start again over and over to get the job done.  I sought out my old review here to see just how long the darn thing lasted...NINE months.  I'm going to wait until my birthday next month and then treat myself to a new coffee maker and this time I will read all the reviews first!\n\n-----\n\nFor the price, this coffee maker should be PERFECT but it is far from it.  The other reviewers have covered everything in detail but one more report won't hurt...too hard to clean, can easily overflow, carafe doesn't pour straight, poor customer service from Cuisinart until you get nasty, etc., etc.  In short, it's the COFFEE that should wreak havoc with your blood pressure, not the coffee MAKER.";Disappointing
131;55.0;4.0;10.0;Works great as long as you adhere to some lessons gleaned from reviews: 1) Use a paper filter.  The included gold filter doesn't allow adequate brew time.  2) You gotta clean it.  Every time.  Even if you don't use the grind function.  Just rinse and wipe or put it in the dishwasher.  I'd give this unit 5 stars if I didn't have to clean it even after a  nongrind brew, necessary because the brew process steams up the grinder.  If they can put a man on the moon ... etc.  (Not sure they can still put a man on the moon though.)  3)  The dribble-when-pouring problem popped up once, but was easily fixed.  Results from the complexity of the thermal pot cap, which lets brewed coffee in, but doesn't let heat out.  If you get this problem, rinse out the cap and wiggle the little in/out flap a couple of times.\nBottom line: great coffee, thermal pot keeps coffee hot for hours without burning, intuitive controls, easy to set timer, some cleaning annoyance, but worth it.;A great little machine if you follow the rules
48;56.0;5.0;8.0;I bought my Grind & Brew factory refurbished.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the coffeemaker.  It has leaked.  The secret is to assemble all the parts BEFORE setting the carafe in place.  No more leaks. The lid leaks when you get to the bottom of the carafe.  I take off the lid at that point, and continue pouring with no problem.  I don't have a problem with cleaning.  I use a bottle brush to clean out the grinding spout.  I run a cloth over the inside after brewing.  I don't find that troublesome.  The coffee tastes great!  I love the timer, and never thought anything about any noise the grinder makes.  What's the big deal?? I never expected a silent grinder. I had guests that were so impressed, they are going to get one, too.  To each his own.;I have No Complaints
56;57.0;2.0;8.0;I bought this coffee pot because it looks great! Cuisinart has a reputable name, too, and with the built in grinder, I thought I had it made!  But like others have said, it is a pain to clean.  But beyond that- the carafe leaks EVERYTIME we pour a cup of coffee.  No matter what we do.  And from time to time, the filter gets clogged up with coffee grounds, and it does result in spilled coffee everywhere.  I lost 10 cups of coffee all on my counters and in my cupboard-  of course, when company was over.  Not a mess I wanted to deal with.  Save your money and do not buy this leaky, hard to clean coffee maker.  You will only be looking for a better model in time.;this item leaks!
111;58.0;1.0;9.0;I'm so disappointed in this piece of crap AND with CUISNART! THIS IS THE WORST DESIGN ever! Aside from the fact that there are way to many parts to put together just to make a pot of coffee, it has to be PERFECTLY DRY or else your coffee will be weak. We were so frustrated with the grind feature we ended up going back to grinding our own coffee and turning the grind feature off. The coffee pot now just malfunctioned and we awoke this morning to a floor filled with coffee grinds and coffee. VERY UPSET and tired and all we want is a cup of coffee we gave the piece of crap another whirl after 30 minutes of cleaning up the kitchen. IT DID IT AGAIN!\nNEVER AGAIN will I spend so much on a Coffee pot. We had another Cuisinart Coffee pot fail. We will never go with their brand again!;BUYERS BEWARE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!
18;59.0;1.0;7.0;My mom bought each of her 3 sons this same coffeemaker for Christmas in 2004. I'm one of the 3 sons. Anyway, I've had a couple of annoying problems with it over the past few months. First, the cheap plastic hinge that covers the water reservoir broke off, and I have trouble closing it. Second, and worse, the coffee has not been going into the coffee pot, but rather all over my kitchen counter, and this has stained my countertop permanently I think. Well, I've cleaned the plastic parts many times per the instructions, yet I can't figure out why the coffee won't make it into the pot. It seems like a simple concept for a machine to achieve, but it doesn't do so properly every morning. So I've had an awful mess many, many times, yet I've thought perhaps it would somehow stop doing this. Finally, a few days ago, I called Cuisinart's customer service group for help and to find out if there was a recall. My first call was disconnected when a rep placed me on hold. Then, when I later called back, twice, my call was never answered.\n\nFor whatever its worth, I talked to my 2 other brothers, and was surprised to learn that they both threw their coffee maker out months ago, for the very same spilling problem I'm having. I give up. I can't wake up to this problem any more, especially without caffeine yet in my blood. I expected better from Cuisinart. They don't seem to care about me at all. And my mother wasted a lot of her Christmas money that year.;So frustrated with it, I give up
22;60.0;4.0;7.0;I purchased this coffee maker for my office and it makes great coffee, has charcol water filtration, a gold tone mesh coffee filter, and keeps the coffee hot for hours. The reason I gave it only four stars is that the design is densely packed to make the machine so small, that the grinder bay gets steam from the hot water, making the coffee grounds stick to the grinder cup and the blade. Washing it requires the grinder assembly, pot, gold mesh coffee filter-(if not using paper coffee filters) and the drip assembly to be washed thoroughly before each use. I've had no problem with the timer function as some other customers have, although this coffee maker will wake you up in the morning! Guaranteed! When the timer starts the machine grinding coffee, the beans sound like broken glass in a blender. After the initial grounds are prepared, it sounds like a 747 taking off with JATO-(Jet Assisted Take Off) bottles attached to the fuselage. Yes, if the coffee doesn't get your heart started, the onboard grinder function will! Still, its a good product from Cuisinart and very reasonably priced for what it does.;Good coffee maker, bad design....sort of
24;61.0;3.0;7.0;"Regarding the Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew -- great idea at first, but a troublesome item to keep clean. It is a lot simpler to merely use the common separate coffee grinder and a more conventional coffee pots because what you gain from the convenience of ""grind and brew"" you loose in cleaning out all the finely ground coffee that seems to be able to collect in the oddest places. I am an engineer, age 82, and it seems to me that a little research on the upkeep required to clean out all the places where the fine coffee grounds collect should have resulted in a product that is less frustrating. The fact that the grinder part and the coffee basket come out for ""easy"" cleaning sounds okay but wait until you find all the corners where it takes a brush (provided) to rake loose the sticky grounds that running water will not take away. Then, there is the impossible problem of cleaning out the accummulation of finely ground coffee grounds from the parts that do not disassemble. Daily maintence of a separate coffee grinder and coffee maker involves much less time to keep clean of stray coffee grounds.";Cuisinart DGB-600BC: Cleaning is a drawback
123;62.0;4.0;9.0;This coffee maker does one thing very well, it makes a great cup of coffee!!  Sure, I would love to find a coffe maker that doesn't need cleaning and is perfect in every detail, but until someone designs one, I'll stick with this, it's great!!;IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT.........
70;63.0;5.0;8.0;This Cuisinart DGB-600BC is the best machine and the best deal.\n\nI bought the reconditioned one from Amazon last month. I could not believe the good price. I told my neighbor, co-workers and relatives about it. I was surprised to find out two things: How many of these machines are out there and how many of these owners had a bad experience with leaking on the carafe. Cuisinart has certainly gotten these fixed and my own machine works great. I am even going to buy an second machine to use as a gift.\n\nMT Keeley\n\nChicago;The best coffee maker I have ever owned!
30;64.0;4.0;7.0;"This pot makes an excellent cup of coffee, but it has some design limitations that if you are aware of them, can still result in a great pot of coffee.\n\nThe Grind and Brew grinds beans and immediately brews them into fresh coffee that stores in the thermal carafe. It has a charcoal filter that is replaceable and markedly improves the flavor of my coffee given my chlorinated municipal water supply (tap water) that I use daily.\n\nHere are some tips that may help in your purchase decision or improve your ownership experience. First of all, the grinder is a pain to clean and is really only convenient if you make one pot a day. Secondly, if you want your coffee to stay warm for several hours, you need to preheat the carafe by filling it with warm tap water, letting it sit for several minutes, then emptying it out and immediately brewing thereafer. As far as complaints that the coffee is too weak, when I use ten scoops of beans for 10 cups of water using the supplied measure, the coffee is more than strong enough. You must also use ""fresh"" beans - if the coffee package has been open more than a week or two, the beans oxidize somewhat and some flavor is lost. I generally re-seal my beans daily using my foodsaver device and a plastic container. Not an absolute must, but helps the flavor. If all this sounds like alot of work - it isn't that bad. The gold filter is fine, but paper filters are easier to clean and don't diminish the flavor whatsoever. Everyone who drinks my coffee really complements the coffeemaker and both my parents and inlaws now own one and are very satisfied - but you have to appreciate the limitations.\n\nFinally, there is a design flaw where the grinder device sometimes gets stuck. Don't know why it happens and cuisinart really should address this, but it has not really impaired my enjoyment of this coffeemaker significantly.\n\nIf I were to improve it, I would switch to a cone filter design which I believe generally makes a better cup. Hope this helps.";Excellent Coffeemaker
90;65.0;5.0;8.0;We've owned a Cuisinart Grind & Brew Coffee Maker for a couple years now. We are very pleased with it and have enjoyed every cup of coffee since. It really isn't much more work to clean than a regular grinder and coffee maker. The simplest way to clean it is to use a small scrub brush and give the parts a quick scrub using hot water. Then place the parts on the counter to dry and it will be ready the next time you want to use it. If you'd like to give it a more thorough clean, most parts can go in the dishwasher. As for the grinder, it's not louder than a regular grinder. If anyone has found a silent coffee grinder I'd like to hear about it. If you really don't want to wake up to the sound of a grinder then you can wait until you wake up to turn it on. It takes approx. 10 minutes to brew, the same as most coffee makers. It is an excellent machine and comes with a 3 year warranty. We would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good cup of fresh coffee.;Excellent Coffee Maker

Each time, it would seem to work fine for a few months, but then it would start leaking water, then make sparking sounds, and finally it would spew electrical smoke everywhere.  This last time I gave up and tore the thing open.... you can see the results under ""customer images"" unless Amazon removes them.\n\nCheap, dried-out rubber water hoses connected to the resistance heater by cheap clamps result in water being spewed directly onto the exposed electrical connections.\n\nWhy did this same problem occur three times in  a row?  Maybe because I only use it on weekends and the hoses were drying out during the week?  Maybe they sent me two re-furb units as replacements that already had partially dried-out hoses?

9;68.0;5.0;6.0;"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.\n\nIf you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.\n\nYou can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.\n\nThe coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.\n\nThe unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.\n\nThe interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.\n\nSome people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.\n\nI love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.\n\nI've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.";4 Years and Going Strong

The filter basket has numerous mechanical parts that can't be removed for cleaning. I contacted Cuisinart but received no help.

11;71.0;1.0;6.0;"This product has been a nightmare from day one. We have experienced many problems with it. Not too long after owning it, it began to shut off before it finished brewing the coffee; we had to continually restart it to get it to brew the full pot. Now, the clock shuts off the minute it finishes a pot. So we have to unplug it and replug it in to brew anymore coffee.\n\nWe have been taking good care of the maker. We clean it quite regularly, and all these problems have occurred in less than a year. This is something I would expect from a thirty-dollar maker, but it's unfortunate to have wasted all this money. Even without the mechanical problems, it is a hassle to make coffee with this product. Now, instead of just grinding in a regular grinder and pouring into a french press, we must clean the grinder, clean the filter, dry the grinder with a paper towel before we can begin to brew coffee.

Already the swing out filter holder/cup area sticks and you have to shove it in - it no longer pops out when you press the button on the side.\n\n- The coffee is weak!

5;75.0;5.0;5.0;After receiving delivery of a faulty Braun KF600 thermal coffee maker that had to be sent back, I stepped up to the next level. The only comparison between the Braun and the Cuisinart DGB-600 is that they both make coffee. I had to write this review for the people who are on the fence and do not mind spending more to get much more. This machine is the GOODS. I have to comment on the negative remarks about this coffee maker. Let me just say it. We all know people like these whiners. We work with them, have in-laws like them and some people are stuck with family members like them. The difference here is, I can speak my mind with little payback. Are you kidding me ! This is a great, well built machine that takes a little bit more effort to clean then any other machine. In the exchange, it produces the best coffee you can make at home. The grinding cycle is active for seconds and will not wake up the average person unless you use it for an alarm. This is not an opinion, but a fact based on life experience and submitted in defense of a great product. Please DO NOT let the negative reviews sway your decision. I am glad that I kept reading reviews that were positive, while profiling the others. The decision then, became less of a risk. This is a GREAT machine and my feedback is not meant to offend anyone, but to make others aware that there are still too many people who want more than the market will bear. Buy this machine and please join me by providing another positive review. You will love this coffee maker. My first Cuisinart Product, with many more in my future. While I'm handing out compliments, Electronic Express had brand new ones in stock at a very reasonable price and it was delivered and making coffee in my home in under 48 hours. That is service, at a very fair price. Amazon is the STANDARD and the new benchmark their competition has yet to overcome. I guess you can say I am happy with my purchase!;You get what you pay for !
132;76.0;5.0;8.0;I am so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews regarding this coffeemaker and chose to buy it anyway.\nI have owned many coffeemakers and none have ever compared to the Cuisinart Grind and Brew Coffeemaker DGB-600BC. This coffeemaker not only looks great in my kitchen but makes an excellent pot of coffee.\nUnlike many of the reviews I had absolutely none of the problems that people have described. The thermos is well made, easy to use and has never dripped. However, I did read the manual thoroughly before using this coffeemaker so I knew what I was doing. It does pay to read the manual!\nEven though it's necessary to clean and dry the parts before making another pot of coffee it's no big deal. The parts come out easily, are a cinch to clean and fit right back into place with no fuss.\nI love that it grinds the beans right in the coffeemaker and I don't have to grind the beans separately and then put them in the coffeemaker.\nI highly recommend this coffeemaker. I use to regularly go out to coffee shops for lattes and mochas, but not anymore. This makes such great coffee I now don't have the need to go out and spend way too much money on lattes and mochas. Even though this coffeemaker is on the expensive end, the money I save not going out for coffee will definitely make up for the cost.\nIf you buy this coffeemaker and read the manual, in my opinion, you won't regret it.;Great coffeemaker - highly recommend buying!

And, Cuisinart refused to help.\n\nSo, I bought a second one.  This unit died after 4 months.  No, I'm not immersing it in water or doing anything odd to it.  It's just not made well.  Yes, I saved the receipt.  However, says ""to facilitate the speed and accuracy of your return, please also enclose $10 for shipping and handling of the product"".  Huh?  They made a bad coffeemaker and they want me to pay for both shipping to AND from Cuisinart?  This really rubs me the wrong way.

32;78.0;5.0;6.0;This coffee maker can be a little tricky to figure out, loud and prone to finger prints.  However, if you are willing put up with all that you will be rewarded with a very good cup of joe.\n\nI almost returned this machine in the first week.  Somehow, I did not place the carafe under the spigot, properly.  Subsequently, the coffee spilled all over the counter.  However, that was the first and only time.\n\nThere are extra parts that need cleaning.  I estimate it takes about three minutes total to clear everything and get ready for the next pot.\n\nThe carafe WILL keep your coffee piping hot all day long.  However, you will have to fill it with hot water, first, to get it hot, before the coffee brews.\n\nPersonally, I like getting large bags of whole beans at Costco for about.  It's economical, ends up tasting great and I don't get grinds on the countertop, anymore...\n\nI use disposable coffee filters.  I find that it makes a smoother cup than the gold filter.\n\nAll in all, this coffee maker is not for everyone.  It's for those who are willing to expend a little effort in the pursuit of the perfect cup of joe.;Best coffe maker on the market
98;79.0;1.0;7.0;My husband and I recently bought (and returned) the white version of this coffeemaker.\n\nThe other reviewers have already summed up the problems, but here are my additional comments:\n\n1. Extremely loud grinder (like an air raid alarm). Your neighbors down the street will know when your Cuisinart comes on each time you brew. Some reviewers have stated that it is no louder than any other grinder. I strongly disagree with that statement.\n\n2. Weak coffee. Even when using the 1-4 cup button and brewing excellent, 100% Kona coffee (delicious under most conditions). The idea of just using more coffee (than you would need to use with a different coffeemaker) is ridiculous when you're paying this much for the machine, not to mention the coffee.\n\n3. Tiresome clean-up. Every part does seem to need cleaning after each pot... and, yes, this is true of many other coffeemakers. The difference is in how much of an annoyance clean-up gets to be when you have wet grounds not only in the filter but also in the grinder, on the lid to grinder, the shoot coming from the grinder, etc. Wet vs. dry clean-up. Let's be honest. Dry clean-up (separate grinder) is a piece of cake.;Loud grinder, light coffee
108;80.0;5.0;7.0;Many of the reviews of the DGB-600BC complain about grinder noise, the difficulty of cleaning, and ground coffee particles escaping the machine.  I don't get it - What's the problem?\nAny grinder is going to make some noise, this one seems no worse than any other.  It does not wake me in the morning.  I find no coffee residue on my kitchen countertop after using the machine.  There are really only two extra parts (the grinder chamber and the grinder chamber top) to clean in addition to parts of a normal drip coffee maker.  As to being messy. . . well, I guess that it could make a pretty good mess if you made coffee without making sure that the grinding chamber were not perfectly dry.  Common sense tells you that trying to grind something into a powder in the presence of water will pretty much create a pasty mess.\nI was really surprised at how long the thermal carafe kept the coffee hot, as not having a warmer under the brewed coffee was one of my first reservations about this machine.  This is a pretty good coffee maker and I'm glad I bought it.;What's the Problem?
41;81.0;1.0;6.0;"I am experiencing many of the problems others have had and my coffee maker is a week old today!\n\n1)If you count the carafe you have to clean 7 parts before brewing another pot. If you want to brew a second pot right away you have to dry many nooks and crannys that you really cannot get to to make sure the grinder is not damp.\n\n2)The carafe is very hard to poor from. I personally have not had any leaking from the carafe like others have had though.\n\n3)The water reservoir is very hard to read. It is difficult to see how much water you are putting in and if you get too much (yes it allows you to put too much) it will over flow the carafe resulting in coffee all over the counter.\n\n4)when I use the grind function the coffee maker has been shutting off either right after the grinding process or after only brewing a couple cups. The machine just shuts off. I have to hit ""grind off"" button and then the ""on"" button again for it to finish brewing. I do not know if it is a short or what.\n\n5)Brew quality is very inconsistent.

53;83.0;1.0;6.0;This was by far the worst coffee pot I have ever purchased.  At first it made fabulous coffee.  However, things just never worked correctly after 3 months.

Forget to empty the carafe (since its stainless you can't tell by looking) and coffee everywhere. These are the ways that I can remember off-hand.\n\nHOWEVER, when we went to the beach for Thanksgiving, we took this coffee maker with us because we have been spoiled since it does make the best coffee. As far as not keeping the coffee hot, it works better than any carafe I've come across and I do not like coffee that has been sitting on a heater for hours. The carafe does tend to drip a bit when pouring, but not badly if the lid is screwed on properly. The grider mechanisim, baskets and carafe can all be put in the dishwasher so I don't know what the cleaning problems may be.\n\nYou need to order a couple of the replacement charcoal filters as well since they are not easy to find.;Like the coffee so much I'll put up with a lot
62;85.0;2.0;6.0;This thing is a major pain. The carafe leaks all over. The filter basket door won't stay closed. The coffee bean holder and the water tank are too close together. You spill beans no telling where stuff goes. I'm retiring it after three months of trial and going back to Capresso.;very poor design
124;86.0;4.0;7.0;I have this coffee maker and it makes wonderful coffee. Properly measured beans give you one of the tastiest cups of coffee ever. This model has a removable charcoal water filter,a no grind setting for already ground coffee. The parts are relatively easy to clean, and the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for a long time.  The negatives features are the loudness of the motor - you don't wanna run this if you live in close quarters and people are sleeping. Also, if any coffee happens to leak into the tray where the pot sits, it leaks all over your counter. The most annoying problem is if you hit one of the outside buttons when cleaning the unit, it starts beeping and will not stop without putting the grind unit all back together. If you use the caraffe to fill the water reservoir, it does not fill it all the way, and also you have to look down into the reservoir to see your water line - there is no indicator on the outside of the unit. With all that said, I still love my Grind and Brew. These few things just take getting used to.;Cuisinart Grind and Brew
69;87.0;3.0;6.0;I agree with most reviews I've read about this coffee maker, including the critical ones.  I bought this even after reading those reviews.\n\nI wish the water level meter was visible from the outside - the step ladder is very hard to see. The unit is indeed a pain to clean. Just putting the various parts in the dishwasher means you spend time taking the unit apart, and then putting it back together later.  It does not need cleaning every time however.\n\nWhat I have not seen mentioned is something I consider to be a design flaw:  steam from the brewing basket (and the carafe) seeps up into the grinding area.  It is this moisture that can create a gooey mess up there.\n\nMy solution?  When brewing is done - pop the top and open the grinder lid.  This dries it out and really reduces the number of times the unit needs cleaning.  Unfortunately, this isn't all that cool looking - especially for a unit that's at least half about appearance.\n\nThe coffee is great and I am happier with this unit then my previous drip coffee maker.\n\nFor the price - I should probably be even happier though.;Good Choice, But ...

The first Grind and Brew was so time consuming to clean, I only used it for about 6 months and then sent it to the basement until I could unload it at a garage sale. I next bought the original Melita Mill & Brew and absolutely adored it. When Cuisinart came out with this model that had an insulated carafe, I could not resist. When I found it at the store, one of the first things I noticed on the box was ""easier to clean."" I took it out of the box to take a look at it and decided to give it a try. It worked pretty good for a few weeks, even though there are 6 pieces that have to be washed every night (7 including the pot itself). And then came the first time I pushed the button to get to the basket assembly and it wouldn't open. That was the night I discovered that the coffee grounds go all over the place, especially in the area of the sliding basket assembly. Now, I have to take a toothbrush every night to clean all of the coffee grounds out of the machine. And this was supposed to be easier to clean!!\n\nTo add insult to injury, just a couple of weeks after I bought this machine, I discovered that Melita also had a model with an insulated carafe. That's why I'm on the Amazon.com site at this time -- to order the new Melita so I can relegate another Cuisinart to the junk pile (don't even think I'm going to try to sell this one to anyone; don't want to burden anyone else with this garbage).";2nd (and last) Cuisinart coffee maker

It is easy to clean, however, it constantly needs cleaning and drying after every use. For couples, you can brew 1-4 cups and if you have guests it can make up to 10 cups. So far we get outstanding compliments from our families and friends. Try it, you might like it! Good luck in selecting a coffeemaker and which ever you chooses, happy brewing:);Our 1st and last coffeemaker.
21;91.0;1.0;5.0;Received this for a wedding present. 1 year later it began leaking water all over the counter when you filled it up. Triedto contact Cuisinart- they would never reply. So we had to stop setting it up at nite, or else we would have all of that water on teh counter/floor. For a while we just put in more water than needed for the pot and hoped it wentfast. finallygave up and bought a $30 machine which is still working great 1.5 years later.. I googled this problem and lots ofother people have had it and had no luck getting Cuisinart to do anything.;I wouldnt buy this again
138;92.0;1.0;7.0;"For Kitchen Art, the DGB-600BC gets an A+.\n But is down hill from there.  When unwrapped there were scraps of metal and plastic from the manufacturing process and this was after runnung water 3 times thru the Brewing process.\n The Carafe must be warmed before brewing.\n The 6 cups calibrated in the Water Tank is actually a bit over 4, 8 oz. cups.\n  If a paper filter is not used with the ""gold"" filter, the water passes the grounds too fast and the result is brown water.\n  The door to the Brew Chamber came open and spilled my coffee to the counter top. This requires a person to watch the entire brewing process.\n  Water passes thru the grounds too fast. A common brown paper filter from Wal-Mart was not porous enough and the Brew Chamber over flowed - making another mess.\n  I strongly suspect Cuisinart did not have a Quality Control Inspector in the Factory that made this Coffee Maker.";BEST KITCHEN DECORATION
86;93.0;5.0;6.0;Do you love coffee?  Me too.  I have owned several coffee makers over the past 10 years, including some from Barista (Starbucks), but this is the best one that I have ever owned.  Very easy to program and even easier to use.  The thermal one (Chrome) is the one that I have and when the pot is brewed at 6am the coffee is still hot at 11.  The only drawback to the Thermal is that it only holds 10 cups verus the non-thermal ones that hold 12.  So sometimes it feels like you have to fill it up a little too often.  Other than that it makes a perfect cup every time.;Best On the Market
89;94.0;1.0;6.0;"I wanted so much to like it -- about $100 worth (thank God I got a 30% discount).  But after just two tries and reading these reviews, I'm gonna take it back immediately and MOVE ON.  Why?\n\n1) the finished coffee is not hot, more like warm.\n\n2) the carafe doesn't keep it at ""warm"" even.\n\n3) the finished coffee is weak, even with addition of more beans\n\n(only made 6 cups, but would have to agree with other reviewers that I can't imagine grinder holding enough beans to brew a strong pot).  And I'm putting in Starbucks Sumatra beans (strong stuff).\n\n4) The water level is difficult to see.\n\n5) I can see just after two uses how the whole mechanism could get clogged with coffee gunk pretty easily and ultimately require daily precise cleaning (not for me thank you).\n\n6) The stainless is nice, but as another poster said, so easily fingerprinted.\n\n7) Oh yeah, it IS a drag to pour from that carafe too -- I didn't have trouble with leakage -- but geesh yeah you do have to practically turn it upside down for the last cup or two.\n\nI think the grind & brew concept is yet to be realized . . .\n\nCertainly it ain't this Cuisinart (I have the 600 by the way).";Me Neither !!!!
25;95.0;3.0;5.0;There's not much more I can say beyond what's already been said. So here is what stands out for me:\n\nPros:\n\n- Coffee stays at least warm all day.\n\n- Very nice to have once all programmed to grind and brew a pot as you're waking up each morning. Can't get a fresher cup.\n\nCons:\n\n- Must wash and thoroughly dry every tiny crevice of the grinder, or else any lingering moisture will cause the newly ground coffee to stick to everything, and not empty into the basket. Annoying when making more than one pot a day.\n\n- If you accidentally hit the start button while cleaning the unit, it will begin to beep until you re-assemble every piece and close it. A real pain when everything is wet. Unplugging it won't even help as when it's plugged back in, the beeping continues.\n\n- Chrome leaves fingerprints.\n\nOverall: I would not recommend this for the price. Instead I would go an get a basic coffee maker and a separate grinder. Lots of kinks still to work out here.;Too much hassle for a cuppa.
26;96.0;2.0;5.0;This product looks great and makes good coffee.  However, it's very cumbersome & difficult to use.  In addition to some of the comments in other reviews, mainly the frustration of not knowing how much coffee is left in the pot, it is almost equally as hard to determine how much water is being poured into the machine in order to make coffee (there is no labeling on the outside).  When we initially purchased this machine we found it annoying having to lean over the top of the machine to see the labeling for pouring in water (number of cups), now the numbers have worn off completely so it's become a guessing game.  It also is difficult to pour water into the machine from the craft without spilling it all over.  My husband and I both regret purchasing this product.;Looks Good but...
96;97.0;1.0;6.0;I've read the other reviews, and I beg to differ.  Rinsing will not clean the accumulated coffee from the bean reservoir or the chute. You must clean with either a sponge, paper towel, or your finger to scrape the residue.  And, if you use an oily coffee like Starbucks, the buildup is just awful.  It takes literally 5-7 minutes to clean the parts (properly) on this coffeemaker. The machine does produce good coffee.  The upside is I'm drinking less coffee now because you don't dare have a second pot in the morning, unless you're on vacation and not in a hurry. The Capresso Coffee Team is a much better unit at only $50 more.;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS COFFEEMAKER
27;98.0;1.0;5.0;i recomend to buy something else. you cant see how much coffee is in the pot! does not fit under my upper cabinets even though the dimesions said it did! my wife hates it!;not easy to use
29;99.0;4.0;5.0;After my sister in law gave us a Hamilton Beach coffee maker that leaked after the first use [...]\n\nThe Cuisinart Grind and Brew is a 10 cup electric coffee maker with a built-in grinder.  It offers a wide assortment of features, such as Pause-and-Serve or a timer that you can preset and have your coffee ready when you first wake up in the morning.  If you don't want 10 cups of coffee, there is also a feature that allows you to brew one to four cups only.  And if you have coffee that is already ground, you can simply push a button and the grinder is turned off.  The Grind and Brew even comes with a re-useable coffee filter.  And on top of all of this, Cuisinart has thought of just about everything - they've included a charcoal filter that helps purify the water before brewing the coffee.  If you get bitter coffee, you can rest assured that Cuisinart wasn't at fault!\n\nThe magic behind the Grind and Brew is that it grinds the coffee beans right before brewing the coffee.  You can't get much fresher than that!  This definitely preserves the flavor.  The experts have found that there is something about the natural oils of the coffee beans that evaporates and the flavor isn't at its peak if the coffee sits for any amount of time.  So if you grind right before making the coffee, you get optimum flavor.  The Taste Keeper lid helps keep that coffee fresh all through the morning in the double-wall insulated brushed stainless steel thermal carafe.  The carafe is cool to the touch, but keeps the coffee nice and hot on the inside.\n\nNow the bad things about this product... I set the timer on my coffee maker.  My husband is up at 5:00 AM and I'm not up until 6:00 AM.  I'm NOT a morning person, so that extra hour of sleep is a necessity!  I do not want to get up and make coffee at 5:00 AM, so I do it the night before.  A few minutes after the alarm goes off, the coffee grinder kicks into gear.  And it's loud!  In fact, it's better than the snooze alarm and the coffee maker is on the other side of the house!  So it does wake me up, but most mornings I drift right back to sleep.\n\nMy biggest problem with the Grind and Brew has to be the grinder.  We drink flavored coffee, with Vanilla bean being my favorite.  After each use, the grinder must be taken apart and thoroughly cleaned.  I've found that the ground coffee sticks to the part that is supposed to have the grinds flow into the basket (looks like a little coffee slide).  A paper towel is needed to dig out the grounds from the corners of this slide so it doesn't clog the grinder the next morning.  That did happen and I had colored water instead of coffee.\n\nOther than those two complaints, I love my Grind and Brew.  My coffee is fresh, tastes wonderful, and is easy to make.  The coffee maker is a little on the expensive side, but well worth it.;Freshest Coffee You'll Get
101;100.0;1.0;6.0;"Sheesh - those product designers/R&D teams... Well, shame on me for not reading these reviews and getting sucked into the beautiful design and CONCEPT of this machine.  It's gonna cost me in return shipping fees, but at least Amazon's return policy is cool...lesson learned.\n\nSo here's our take...We used top of the line beans - so much texture and layers of flavor.  I'm the coffee maker in our family and am skilled enough with my bean grind/water level ratios to create a fabulous cup of coffee at home (I used to work at a coffee house).  But that involves the 2 step process of using a grinder and a brewing method.  However, it also provides CONTROL over the process.  I loved that this machine could do the whole deal in one fell swoop.  But they didn't provide enough CONTROL over the creation of a great brew!  And isn't creating a flavorful mouthful of anything an art?  And doesn't art require the artist having good tools and CONTROL over their project?  Alright, alright, I'm passionate about great coffee...\n\nOkay, here are where the problems come in:\n\n1st and most importantly: The grinder cup IS WAY TOO SMALL to grind enough beans for anything over 4 cups!\n\nSo you think: ""Well, I'll just pre-grind some beans and have them waiting in the filter to make up for their design deficiency!  Aha!""\n\nThen you think:  ""Wait!  That defeats the purpose!""\n\nAND, moreover, furthermore, have I mentioned there isn't even enough room in that filter to accommodate the amount of grind required to make a full-bodied cup of coffee!  Urrgghhh.\n\n3rdly: The carafe needs to be inverted, yes, flipped upside down, in order to eke out that whopping 4 cups of mediocre brew.  Annoying.\n\nSo, we learned we like coffee ready for us in the morning (vs. wasting lots of $$$ at coffee pit stops before work).  And the scent actually drags our butts out of bed earlier (during our normal ""snooze"" hitting period).  So we ended up actually sharing a cup of coffee in the morning together.  Lovely.\n\nThe cleaning, drying, etc. - whatever.  That didn't bother me a bit.  The setting it up - easy.  The looks - awesome.  The grind in the morning - loud, but better than our alarm's first attempt to wake us with it's obnoxious ""beep, beep, beep.""  Realizing my husband and I love the smell and availability of freshly pre-programmed brew wafting through the house, priceless.\n\nNeedless to say, we suggest looking for a different brew method than this very poorly designed one.  We are definitely going to skip the grind and brew combo and stick with the old-fashioned 2 step process which will let me have my precious coffee CONTROL!";FORM OVER FUNCTION!  Top grade beans produce 7-11 taste!
104;101.0;3.0;6.0;"I've never written a review before, but felt this one deserved a warning.  Plus side - good insulated urn with a warmer that helps keep the coffee hot longer, nice design with brushed crome, zero dripping when you pull it out mid brew, you can leave it in or out of the machine after brewing (my last coffeemaker didn't seal up, which keeps the coffee hot, when it was in the machine; had to take it out to keep cold air from getting in).\n\nDown side - INCREDIBLY noisy (like a jet taking off; tough with kids sleeping right upstairs; but, then again, no need for an alarm clock any more), all parts must be rinsed out daily to keep coffee from building up on walls of grinder (the steam from the coffee goes up into the grinder and makes left over ground cake to the side) and coffee is just OK (need to use french roast or other deep roasted coffee for decent flavor).  I used to be in the ""if it isn't strong enough, you're not using enough coffee"" camp.  Unfortunately, the grinder and basket are only so big, so there is a limit.  More importantly, I think the issue is how the water is filtered.  Unlike some makers with a waffle-like series of holes that drip water all over the basket surface, this one is limited to a few holes.  When you make a full pot, coffee is actually pretty good, as I think the water has time to ""leach"" into all the grounds during a full brew.  However, if you're making any less (say, 6 cups), it's tough to get full flavor.  I think the designers realized this and added the 1-4 cup button to slow the process, but it's still not perfect.";"INCREDIBLY noisy grinder; Expensive for just OK coffee"
115;102.0;1.0;6.0;"We finally decided to go out and spend a few extra bucks for a decent coffee maker and came across this one which had the grinder built in (which seemed like a good idea).  At first glance the unit looks sharp (hence the 1 star) and we were looking forward to using our new toy.  Here is what we found after our first week of use:\n1)  Grinder sounds like a contractor in your kitchen sawing your kitchen table in half...yes..its that loud!\n2)  Ok..so why do we buy coffee makers?  For good coffee right?  Well this brewed ""coffee flavored"" water.  It was nasty and we even threw in an extra helping of beans than the recommended amount...WEAK!!!\n3)  Now what?  Yup..you have to break down the whole thing and clean it out...including the nasty slick sludge that accumulates in the grinding station.  What a pain!!!\nBottom line, we boxed it up and got a full refund for this joke of a coffee maker...DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!";This product is complete junk!!!
116;103.0;4.0;6.0;"I've been using this for about a month and a half now, and I still love this coffeemaker. We've been using whole-bean coffee for years, but after I broke our last coffeemaker with a built-in grinder, I decided to step up to this one - I wanted one that also had the thermal carafe. All I could say about the coffee was WOW! I couldn't believe the difference between the two coffeemakers. It's good enough that I actually take two travel cups of coffee with me in the morning.\nThere are some things I don't like about it, but they're not so bad that I wouldn't buy this again in a heartbeat - the quality of the coffee outweighs the negatives. The things I don't like are:\n- I hate the brushed chrome - it's always collecting fingerprints. Looks nice when it's clean, but it doesn't stay that way for long. Unfortunately, I don't think it's available any other way with the thermal carafe.\n- There are a number of parts to clean; however, we just throw it all in the dishwasher, and then it's not really that big a deal.\n- There are some loose grounds that collect in the filter area that need to be wiped out; that's just a minor inconvenience.\nNow, for the parts I like:\n- The way the grinder is designed, the coffee grounds end up getting blown out of the grinder area once they're ground down to a certain size; my old coffeemaker seemed like some of it would end up getting ground down to a powder, but not with this one. True, if you want it ground really fine (like for espresso or a really strong brew), this won't work for you, as it's designed to create a medium grind. It works just right for me, though.\n- The thermal carafe works great! Yes, if you want your coffee to stay hot the longest, you need to preheat the carafe (I just fill mine full of hot water from the sink). But, if you do, we've come home late in the evening 15-16 hours after we made the pot, and it was still relatively hot - not drinkable hot, mind you, but impressive that it still held in any kind of heat after that long.\nSomebody else I saw complained about how loud the grinder is; we don't have that problem. I guess if you live in a studio apartment or you keep it in your bedroom, maybe, but we can be in the next room (with no doors between), and it's not that bad - our 4 month old baby even sleeps through it. Plus, it's still quieter than our old coffeemaker.\nOverall, the coffee's great. I don't know if it's the strength of the grind that's just right, or the built-in water filter, or the temperature or length of the brew - all I know is that it comes out great. I only gave it four stars because there's a few things I mentioned that I don't like, but I'd still buy this again in a heartbeat.";Not quite perfect, but the coffee's great
118;104.0;2.0;6.0;"When this coffeemaker was out as a new product last December 2002, I was so thrilled and ordered it quickly thru Chef's Catalog because it provided a thermal carafe and a build-in grinder.  I love the sleek look of this coffeemaker.  After using this coffeemaker for a year, I sent few emails of frustration on lukewarm water I get for only 2 cups of coffee.  They said that it must be defective on my coffeemaker and suggested me to send for an exchange.  But, I decided to look thru people's reviews.  Yeah, I see that they do complain on same problem I have.  But, this coffeemaker does make piping hot coffee if you pour more than 4 cups waters. It is ironic that this coffeemaker has a button for 1to4 cups. I even used the method to warm up the carafe with hot water under the sink, it still doesn't make coffee hot.  I have to gulp it in few minutes or I'll have a cold coffee.  It is not a relaxing drink.\n\nOne other con is cleaning the grinder basket and cap on the top.  When you grind the beans, it leaves the dust on the bowl and cap.  During the making of coffee, the steam will go thru the grinder and caused the mess to stick on the grinder basket and the cap.  You have to take all and rinse in the water and leave them to dry up or wash them in soapy water.  It is too much trouble!!!\nGuess what?  I got a full refund credit on this coffeemaker thru Chef's Catalog.  Wow!  Even, after a year!  I am relieved that I don't have to sell it thru Ebay or whatever.  I decide to buy Cuisinart 4-cup coffeemaker with stainless steel carafee and Delonghi Grinder(one that I can leave beans in and grind as few as 2-3 tablespoons).  My husband said,""Yes, I notice that it makes big difference with water.""  Now, we have a great hot coffee!!!  I assume that if you drink few cups, buy small coffeemaker.  Good Luck with your decison!";Not for few coffee cups drinkers!
120;105.0;1.0;6.0;"This looked like a sleek, upscale machine when I bought it.  The brushed chrome look, the thermal carafe, and the built-in grinder all were qualities that I was looking for.  Unfortunately, now it looks horrible as a broken, dented mess after I threw it across my garage in an act of final frustration after a year's use.\nDid Cuisinart ever test this item in their own kitchens?  I doubt it.  The carafe DOES NOT POUR WITHOUT SPILLING! I've tried everything:  pouring extremely slowly, not filling it as high, all to no avail.  Everyday, I folded a new towel underneath where I pour the coffee into my mug, and everyday I washed a saturated towel where at least one cup of coffee ran down the side of the carafe as I poured it.  But for some masochistic reason, this was still ok with me.  I think because of the ridiculous sum of money I spent for this daily a.m. torture, I was willing to put up with spilled coffee.  Then, the grinder stopped working.  It quit. Died. All this after I meticulously cleaned it everyday, babied it better than I did my own children.\nSo in the days leading up to the famous pitch through the garage, I pre-ground my coffee in a separate grinder, then poured this pre-ground coffee through a spilling carafe.  On the horrible morning of the ""event"", I brewed the coffee, turned around, started getting breakfast together, and when I turned back around, there was coffee flowing freely all across the counter.  This was the bitter-end of my $179 high-end coffee machine.  Save yourself the misery, get the Bunn and the grinder of your choice.  Or go to Starbucks.";Biggest Rip-Off in the World of Coffee
121;106.0;5.0;6.0;Gripe! Gripe! Gripe! I don't understand the negative reviews concerning this product. So you have to do some clean up after using it? Is that a big deal? The cleaning parts are removeable and easy to clean. Coffee not strong enough? Hmmmm! Can't see where that is the machines problem. Maybe better beans? Hopper of grinder not large enough for 12 cups? Hmmmm, again! My DGB-600 BC is designed for 10 cups max! Maybe some people should read the manuel. Coffee not hot enough? Sounds like some hang out too much at Starbucks with its steam machines. I love my coffee maker. I have had several Krups and they gave me good service, and good coffee, but nothing as good as this coffee maker. So, you have to use a little elbow grease to keep it clean! Good things come with a price! And the price of doing a little clean up is worth it for a superior cup of coffee.;No Pain, No Gain

39;108.0;4.0;5.0;"Delicious coffee; restaurant taste; stays hot; beautiful too.  The only reason I didn't give this coffee maker 5-stars include two episodes of flooding the counter, my fault, both times. 1st time, forgot to put the paper filter in the basket and the 2nd time, I overfilled it which is easy to do because there is no site glass and you can't see the numbers on the inside of the filling tank. This should be improved by now, I would imagine. I am updating this on 6-6-09 and I originally wrote this review 1-16-2006, shortly after buying it. The grinder is loud and has to be cleaned and dried between brews. So, I just don't even use it anymore. I buy ground coffee now, and it's delicious. Stay true to the instructions.  I've never had a coffee maker flood the counter before until now so be careful when filling the reservoir. Now, I use a pitcher marked along the side to denote a perfect fill every time.  Tips: preheat the carafe while your filling, adding coffee, etc. Fill the pot with hot water and let it sit there for a minute or two and your coffee will be delicious for hours. If you don't think this could happen to you, get it.  I didn't return it, just became more disciplined with it.  I got it on sale, so don't have much money in it and it does make superb coffee.  Im more careful now, and the flooding has never happened again since using a premeasured pitcher to fill the reservoir.  A note on temperature.  Hot; nice and hot if you remember to preheat the carafe.  I get up at 4:45, make coffee and hubby gets up at 6:15.  He still has hot, great tasting coffee, when preheating carafe.  If you use the program mode, you obviously can't preheat the carafe and the coffee isn't hot enough for him, So now I just make it when I get up and always preheat the carafe for about one minute while filling, and adding coffee. A great cup of coffee but Cuisinart has some additional engineering to make this pot perfect. I have owned this pot for 3 plus years and I'm not sure if we'll buy another one. The heater will no longer brew the whole pot, so i have to push the 3-4 cup button to get it to brew all the water in the reservoir.  It takes too long to brew. These learned experiences is why the pot doesn't get 5-stars. I am quality manager and will be sharing my 3 plus years experience with Cuisinart quality professionals in hopes they will listen to me and fix these problems. If you can get it on sale, go for it but I wouldn't pay full price. If you are easily frustrated, don't get it. If you're easy going and want a great cup of coffee, using these tips will help you enjoy this item if you choose to go ahead. Heh, it can be like a test of your will, determination and demeaner. Will it win out or will you? Enjoy!";Cuisinart Grind and Brew - Don't forget a filter

The design is ingenious. I've had many problems in the past with the ""integrated grinders"" getting clogged and not flowing into the filter basket. This one is PERFECT...it flushes the basket after grinding, then one can remove the grinder portion, and rinse it VERY EASILY afterwards. The coffee is slow-brewed, not the FAST [material] the Bunn's make. The thermos and beautiful stainless steel are simply bonuses.  I don't know of a better all around coffee maker/grinder combo...\nI guess my only gripe is that it uses the (harder to find) #4 filters, instead of the more ubiquitous #2's...but I can always use the included gold permanent filter if I run out...";Best Integrated Grinder/Coffeemaker out there!!
130;112.0;4.0;6.0;"Original Review 4/12/2003:\nWe bought the first model of the Cuis Grind & Brew, and it was nice.  This one is much better, and worth the difference in price.  The design is easier to clean, and since the grinder is more separated from the brewing area, it doesn't form as much ""sludge"" in the grinder, which can just be wiped out with a paper towel.  Also the electronics are much less likely to get wet, which is (we believe) why our old one died.  The coffee is about the same as the old model---it's not consistent (and we can't figure out why) but most of the time it's good to really-good. I couldn't find another grind & brew model with a timer for what I considered a reasonable amount of money, and I like not having two appliances on our small counter area.  Also, this one is shorter than the old model, so it fits under the cabinet.  Besides, it looks cool.  (We call it the Mother Ship.)  This one has a thermal stainless steel carafe instead of glass (no hotplate); it turns itself off when it's done brewing, so a) the coffee stays nice and hot (without getting caramelized), and b) there's nothing to overheat.  I do wish they sold a spare carafe, but it appears not.\n\nUpdate 12/29/2006:\nThe coffeemaker I originally wrote this review about is still chugging along, being used at least once a day.  The only problem we've had with it is the spring on the filter basket has gotten a little weak, and we have to be sure it gets completely seated or we end up with coffee all over the kitchen.  But that's only happened a couple of times, and now we know what to watch out for.  I still love this unit, and when this one finally dies, I'll probably buy another one just like it.";It's not perfect, but...
64;113.0;5.0;5.0;This is a great coffeemaker.  The coffee tastes excellent and the stainless thermos like coffee pot is great for keeping the coffee hot for a long time.  The clock and timed brewing programming steps are simple and easy to remember.  The built in grinder is simple to clean and really only takes a minute or two to get ready for a new pot of coffee.  I don't understand all the complaints about this coffee maker that I have read on the opinion sites. The only small issue is finger prints which is the same for ANY stainless steel appliance and after using some stainless cleaner/polish it looks great all the time.;Excellent Coffeemaker
66;114.0;5.0;5.0;In a very short time, this machine has become part of my daily grind. In the evening, I clean it, load it and set it up on the timer. In the morning, I wake-up to great coffee.

I save a lot of time staying out of the line at Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. I think the coffee is as good.\nI have tried a lot of different brands of beans. I think Brokaw and Eight o' Clock Club, old-fashioned brands, are just as good, if not better then the premium bands that sell at almost twice the price.\nMay 09,2011 update.  should have spelled it as Bokar not Brokaw.

If it were to break down at this late date, I would definitely buy another Cuisinart Grind and Brew.;Works as advertised - great brew
67;115.0;5.0;5.0;I really  like this machine, it saves space (important when you live in Manhattan!), grinds the beans perfectly and  makes a great tasting cup of coffee. Not having a  hot plate means the coffee doesn't burn like in most machines but stays hot long enough to keep me in coffee through the Sunday newspaper.\n\nMany reviewers complained about the cleaning but it comes apart easily and everything goes in the dishwasher, if  you then leave the top open for a bit there's  nothing else to  do - much easier than some of the (many) other machines I've had.\n\nThe door for the brew basket could be a  little sturdier but you'd have to be heavy handed to break it. The carafe is far sturdier than many others and as the lid twists off rather than being on a hinge it isn't going to break in the dishwasher. Another  plus  is the built in water filter- you don't  have to use it but it's  really handy if you have hard or bad tasting water.\n\nFinally, cuisinart is great for replacement parts, if  you do manage to break something you can generaly buy another.;The best general coffee maker I've had
73;116.0;4.0;5.0;My second Cuisinart Grind and Brew arrived directly through Cuisinart yesterday, replacing the original, still under warrantee, that died a sudden death a few days ago. The replacement model is far superior to the original.\n\nThe leaky carafe referenced in most reviews has been replaced by one with a textured spout. After two years of coffee spilling on the counter with every cup, the new design is a welcome change. My paper towel consumption is going to be nil.\n\nImprovement number two is temperature. The coffee is MUCH hotter.\n\nLet's just hope machine number two lasts longer than the original.;New Machine far superior
78;117.0;4.0;5.0;I have owned several of these grind and brew machines over the past 10 years or so (Toshiba Cafe San, Brookstone, etc.)  This is quieter than anything I have owned to date.  I set it for about 10 minutes after my alarm clock, and get out of bed to a wonderful aroma.\n\nThere are quite number of parts to clean, but they clean up pretty easily. I use paper filters, which gives me one less part to clean (the gold filter.)\n\nOne thing that happens with this machine which did not with my others is that the steam creeps into the grinding chamber, dampening the residual powder.  If that were not the case, it could be simply brushed out, but consequently, this part needs to be washed after each use.\n\nThat aside, it is insanely easy to use and program.  The coffee tastes great, which is the bottom line anyway.  I can't imagine anyone wanting their coffee hotter than this makes it.  I never need to pre-heat the carafe (in fact I use it to measure and pour the water at night.)\n\nThe carafe is really strange.  It is obviously designed to keep the coffee hot (and it does, for hours), but to get the last cup, you need to turn it 180 degrees UPSIDE DOWN !!  This is no exaggeration. Once you get over that, there is little not to like.  I could see if you are careless, and neglect to assemble the parts firmly that this could create quite a mess.\n\nHowever, if one is that ill-inclined mechanically, I would respectfully recommend Starbucks on the way to work.;Quirky, but makes a fine cup of Joe
79;118.0;3.0;5.0;Good Points Over My Past Coffeemakers:\n\n- I love the taste of freshly ground coffee.\n\n- The built-in grinder works well.\n\n- Beeping tells you when coffee is ready.\n\n- Nice design and looks great.\n\nBad Points Over My Past Coffeemakers:\n\n- Cannot tell amount coffee left in thermal carafe.\n\n- Coffee pours out slowly from carafe and drips all over countertop or whatever is underneath it.\n\n- Carafe requires you to pour at a steeper angle which I think causes it to leak down past the pour spout all over everything.\n\n- The grinder in very loud for about 30~40 seconds when grinding.\n\n- I find I have to clean more than my old machine, I clean the grinder, grinder lid and coffee ground basket every time I make a pot of coffee oh yes and the carafe.\n\nMy number one complaint about the coffeemaker is the drip problem I have every time I pour a cup of coffee. This is very messy and aggravating.\n\nThe taste is wonderful but they will have to fix the drip problem or I will have to convert back to my old coffeemaker.............glad I didn't throw it away!!;Cuisinart DGB-600 coffeemaker
80;119.0;1.0;5.0;I liked the idea of grinding just-in-time and in the same unit, to cut down on the steps and time required to get coffee setup at night, and the mess it creates.\n\nI found it takes longer and makes more mess rather than less.\n\nThe unit has some basic design flaws. The grinder is right above the filter, and every time you use the unit, steam from the brewing process gets into the grinder making a mess out of the grinder compartment that is a lot of work to clean.\n\nI use about as much water for brewing as for cleaning the unit. Also, there's about 2 tbsp of coffee grounds that get stuck in various part of the grinder which don't get used in the brewing. That's a lot of waste of perfectly good coffee.\n\nAnd having a flat round filter rather than a cone filter, I found the coffee doesn't taste as round and strong as what I'm used to from my old Krups machine.\n\nIf it wouldn't be such a pain, I'd take it back.;Not what I expected for this price
81;120.0;1.0;5.0;This product makes great coffee.  But if ease of use is your priority this is a zero.  It is loud.  If you program the timer for morning coffee you won't need an alarm.  It grinds for an eternity.  To add insult to injury there are six separate parts you need to wash each time you use the pot. Dont make my mistake.  Buy a separate grinder and coffee maker. This one is a looser.;Worst of the best
82;121.0;4.0;5.0;"I have read the reviews on other all-in-one grinder/brewers, and was a bit skeptical about this one. Since I got it as a gift, I put my doubts aside and tried the machine.\n\nThe results? They were good enough to put all my doubts about the machine in the garage sale heap (where my old coffee maker is going). Put water in the resevoir, put the amount of beans you prefer into the grinder, close the lid, push the brew button, and walk away. It's truly ""fire and forget!""\n\nThe insulated carafe is extraordinary. Coffee poured as long as 10 hours after brewing still pours out hot enough not to require reheating. Those that desire coffee at scalding temperatures will still find the coffee temperature acceptable after four or five hours. My only wish is the opening to the carafe was a bit bigger for my hands to get in while washing.\n\nI will admit the need to clean the grinder after every use is a bit tedious--the only reason I didn't rate this exquisite machine five stars--but the quality of the brew and the ease of the brew more than makes up for its tediousness.";A Very Good Machine--But Takes a Little Work
84;122.0;4.0;5.0;"Definitely a lot of fun to use; dump the beans in the top, push a button, it whines and grinds, fills the kitchen with coffee aroma, and 5 minutes later very good coffee.\n\nThis is where the fun stops. Cleaning is a pain. The rising steam from the coffee brewer soaks whatever coffee grinds are still in the grinder, making them stick to the sides. Must be rinsed and dried each time.\n\nSecond, it uses a lot of bean. It is a whirling blade-type grinder with a grill that allows only the smaller ground fragments to drop down into the filter. However, the grill is rather coarse, and so is the resulting grind. Therefore uses 50% more bean than grinding it yourself.\n\nThe thermal carafe does a fine job. Thermal carafes seem to be the best for keeping coffee fresh over time; no overheating. The coffee does gets somewhat warmer over time, and it appears there is some sort of warming from below, but it is mild.\n\nAlso makes a great alarm clock. The noise of the whirling grinder starting up in the morning will wake anyone. By the time you have your socks on the coffee is brewing. It has become part of my morning routine.\n\nAll in all, the concept is great, the intent is noble, but the finished product falls somewhat short. Whatever time you think you might save by not having to grind and transfer coffee etc is surely lost by the amount of time you have to clean and take care of the machine. You might end up enjoying this, but this is probably a design that some obsessive and more consumer-driven Japanese company will one day perfect.";a lot of fun, good coffee, not greatest design
85;123.0;2.0;5.0;The thermal carafe dose a wonderful job of keeping the coffee hot. When brewing pre ground coffee I dislike that you must turn off the grind feature before turning on the unit every time you want to make coffee. I also dislike the angle required to pour the coffee.;Needs Improvement
87;124.0;5.0;5.0;I got this as a Christmas gift for my mom. Her old coffee broke down so she got this before Christmas and we love it! I bought it for her and then got on Amazon to look at the reviews and got worried about only three stars and people talking about the different issues they have had with this coffee system.  We have been using it for two weeks now with none of the issues other people are talking about (i.e. leaking, filter trouble, etc.)  But we did do something some people may not have tried before using this product-we read through the entire manual before we did anything.  Maybe this has made all the difference.  My mom and I are both die hard coffee drinkers and have never had a better cup of coffee!!  The fresh grind feature is incredible, put in fresh coffee beans, set the timer and viola-wake up in the morning to the freshest cup of coffee you have ever had.  My mother is kind of a clean freak and has always washed out her coffee pots daily, so this suggestion from the manufacturer is no biggee and well worth the effort.  The only scary aspect of this product is the intimidating price, but if the coffee lives up to cuisinart durability, or only lasts for five years it is well worth the price.  We have also used the standard pre-ground coffee option and like it almost as well, product delivered-but once you get a taste of fresh ground coffee there is no going back.  I am now officially a coffee snob.;Would rate even higher if I could!!
88;125.0;1.0;5.0;I wish I would have read some of these reviews before I just bought the Cuisinart Grind and Brew.  My husband and I are big coffee drinkers and love the Starbucks quality of a rich brew.  We have a 6 year old Mr. Coffee coffeemaker that we paid $20 for, and I was ready for something new that wouldn't scald the coffee if you left it on the burner for more than 15 minutes.  Well, let me tell you, my Mr. Coffee $20 investment makes much better coffee than this one!  My husband and I made 2 pots when it first arrived- the first one was so weak we thought we must have done something wrong, so we made a second pot.  After using more coffee beans than we do with our old 15 (!) year old Braun coffee grinder (which still works great, by the way), we found we still had very weak coffee.  And I completely agree with the person who wrote A Big Disappointment, the lid is very poorly constructed where you have to nearly turn it upside down to get the coffee out, and the jet plane sound on the coffee grinder makes you think the pot is getting ready for liftoff.;Big Disappointment, I Agree!
91;126.0;1.0;5.0;I bought this as a present for my wife, who liked the idea of putting beans in the resevoir, setting the timer and waking up to a delicious cup of coffee.  Unfortunately, the grinder works, but it does not allow you to set fineness to your taste.  Steam rises from the brewing area and moistens the grinding part, so you have to clean a bunch of soggy coffee grounds out of the top of the maker every night in addition to cleaning the filter and the carafe.  Worst, the filter basket is prone to popping out on its own in the middle of the brewing process, sending coffee streaming down the counter and onto the floor.  Finally, the carafe leaks.;Bad Coffee + Big Mess
93;127.0;5.0;5.0;The coffee tastes great -- I use 10 heaping scoops per pot.  The thermal carafe keeps the coffee tasting good for hours. In the four months since purchase I've had none of the mishaps with overflowing liquid or messy grounds that other reviews mention.\n\nThe big advantage of this coffee maker, in my opinion, is that you put whole beans in the top the night before, and fresh coffee is waiting for you in the morning.  Because the coffee is moved from the grinder unit to the filter basket using water, the built-grinder is a little bit harder to clean than a separate grinder (I clean mine every evennig before I prepare the next day's pot). But I am a zombie in the morning and this coffee maker means I don't have to fumble with the grinder or measuring beans before I'm fully awake. For me, this is the big selling point.;Starts the day off right!
95;128.0;1.0;5.0;"I have waisted my money on two of Cuisinarts machines. The first one lasted a year and a day! Even before the year was up the carafe leaked. This one didn't even last that long.  What were they thinking when they put the grinder over where the steam comes up!!?? By the time you coffee is finished you have a gross mess on your hands and it takes more time to clean it out after each use then it does to get ready for work.  I started using my other grinder and turning the grinder off.. Then while brewing, the grinder would come on for no reason, then you could not get it to turn off..\n\nI went out and got a Ham-Beach Brew Station... OH MY The first one I got was broke, the second one I got the coffee tasted like plastic, nothing i could do to get that taste out of it.. (so much for all the high rated machines) I decided on the Krups and it has been a few months now and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!! (was rated lower and that is one of the reasons i got it) So much for ""ratings"" LOL\n\nI would not get this Machine EVER AGAIN or any Cuisinarts for that matter!";Worst design.. What were they thinking
102;129.0;1.0;5.0;This item has to be one of the worse products that I have ever owned. It makes an o.k. cup of coffee, it is a nightmare to clean, & after only 9 months the grinder no longer works. I do not have one positive thing to say about this product. Nice concept, poorly designed.;DO NOT BUY!
107;130.0;1.0;5.0;This model was a Christmas gift.  I don't use it very often because it is so unpredictable and makes such a mess.  Coffee doesn't flow into the pot, rather on the counter and on the floor!  The first pot I made soaked the instruction book and the warranty card.  I dried the book and read it carefully to see what I did wrong.  There were two possibilities - too fine of coffee and placement of the filter basket.  Even following the instruction book (which you shouldn't have to do for a coffee maker!) its performance is erratic.  Sometimes a great cup of coffee, other times coffee soaked up in the towels I wrap around and under it never knowing when it's going to leak.  Here's the worst part - I went online to Cuisinart, explained the problem and asked for their advice.  They never even responded.  That says a LOT too.  Do yourself a favor and pick another model.;DON'T buy it!!!!
109;131.0;2.0;5.0;I upgraded from an ancient glass pot style Mr Coffee that I've had for 10 years to this model a few months ago.  I was really interested in the integrated grinder feature of this model, since I've been using a separate grinder and found it a hassle to have two appliances on the counter for making coffee.\nThe biggest problem I have with this model is the time it takes to clean between each use.  With my old grinder I would clean it once per week or so, but with the integrated grinder, the steam from the coffee rises up into the grinder and turns the grind dust into mud.  It takes about 15 minutes of cleanup for EVERY pot of coffee, which is just too much work.\nOn the positive side the model looks nice (I have the brushed chrome), doesn't take up much counter space, and makes good tasting coffee.  The temperature of the brew isn't super hot, but it does retain its heat well in the insulated carafe.\nOverall I don't think this model was worth the money, and the integrated grinder was a big disappointment.;Mixed Feelings
110;132.0;1.0;5.0;"My Cuisinart coffee pot was purchased less than a year ago and we find that we already have to replace it.  Some of the problems we have had include:\n-Leaking water\n-Vibration of coffee grinding causes brew door to fly open (no audible tone sounds a ""warning"" as it does for just about everything else), so instead of coming down to freshly ground and brewed coffee in the morning you come down to hot water all over the counter and no coffee\n-Slide on brew door does not work often and there is quite a bit of trouble involved with opening the door to clean\nAdditionally, for some reason there are 5 people in my immediate family that have these coffee pots and every single one of us experiences this problems.  One sister went so far as to ship hers back to Cuisinart for repair but she still has all the same problems with it.\nMy advice; Do not buy this coffee pot!";The worst coffe pot in the world
112;133.0;5.0;5.0;Honestly, I can't understand many of the comments regarding this fine product.  I've been using it for over a month and it's lived up to expectations.  The clean up only takes a few minutes to basically rinse out the components, as for the noise I can only gather that folks who are complaining never ground their coffee prior to buying this unit because its no louder than portable grinder that I use.  My suggestion would be to have some pre ground coffee available and use the grind off feature if have very light sleepers in the house.  The two best things I like about this maker are that it makes great coffee and the thermal carafe keeps the last cup as fresh and hot as the first.;Great coffee maker getting a bad rap
113;134.0;1.0;5.0;"Sounds great. Grinds, brews, and keeps the coffee warm.\nThe grinder sounds like an air-raid siren (at 5 am) and doesn't grind the coffee well enough to get a good cup of coffee (I spend too much on beans to drink Sanka). Okay, fine. I used my old grinder and put grounds in the basket. The basket pops open and gets grounds and coffee everywhere. This thing has ""blown-up"" so many times I just can't count any more. But, the thermal carafe works, (it's the only thing that does) it keeps the coffee hot.\nFinally though, I'm tired of this crap and I will return the coffee maker...";An Expensive Mistake
119;135.0;4.0;5.0;If you are one of those people who insist that their beans are freshly ground then this is the coffee maker for you.  This machine makes the best home-brewed coffee I have ever tasted, bar none.  Program it ahead of time and it will even wait to grind the beans until you want your coffee made.\nI recommend that you spend the extra money for the stainless steel thermal carafe model.  Its airtight stainless steel double wall carafe keeps your coffee at drinking temperature for hours without scorching it on a burner.  Also, since this unit lacks an open burner it is really kid friendly.\nClean-up takes about 2 minutes, but that is a small sacrifice.  If you already grind your own beans at home then the clean-up is easier than most grinders.;Excellent Coffee Maker!
122;136.0;5.0;5.0;I purchased my unit about 6 months ago.  I loved the idea but was dissapointed at the carafe.  You have never seen the art of pouring until you own one of these.  I tried every which way to pour and prevent dripping and was seldom successful.  Finally, in desperation (and because I lost the basket cover) I contacted Cuisinart customer service and ordered a basket cover.  I made an off-handed suggestion that they should consider redesigning their carafe.  Within 24-hours, I received a telephone call telling me they were sending a new carafe as well as the lost cover at no charge.  Wow!  The newly designed carafe is WONDERFUL.  Because of their great service, I have ordered a Cuisinart food processor even though Consumer Reports rated the KitchenAid slightly higher.\nSo all those who have the old design, please contact [...] and let them replace your carafe.  You'll fall in love with your coffee maker again.;great service from Cuisinart
125;137.0;2.0;5.0;I bought this Cuisinart Thermal Grind & Brew to replace my previous non-Thermal model, also a Cuisinart Grind & Brew.  Having had my first G&B for four years and really liked it, I expected the Thermal model to be a great step-up.  I also thought the extra $50 for the Thermal in stainless was a good deal.  The machine makes a great-tasting cup of coffee - no question about it.  It is also a nice looking piece of equipment.\nHowever, it has one major and highly disappointing flaw.  The coffee is simply brewed at too cool a temperature.  Immediately after brewing, the coffee is hardly hot.  'Very warm' is probably the best way to describe it.  And keep in mind that as this is machine uses a thermal carafe, there is no 'hot plate' to further heat the coffee after it is first brewed.  The carafe is all that maintains the temperature of the coffee, and it does an excellent job in that regard.  But as the coffee is only 'very warm' in the first place, it's moot.  'Very warm' in to the carafe, 'very warm' out.\nThe machine does feature a '1-4 Cup' button that supposedly heats the water to a higher temperature before brewing.  I've taken to using this all the time, regardless of the brew size.  It seems to make no difference to the temperature whatsoever.\nAs I mentioned at the start of this review, the machine brews a great tasting cup of coffee.  However, the fact that I have to microwave each mug I pour for a full 60 seconds kind of knocks the enjoyment out of it.  I expected more from Cuisinart.;Brew temperature way too low.  Big disappointment.
133;138.0;1.0;5.0;After reading all the positive reviews on this site,  I ran out and bought one as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend.  What a disappointment.  The coffee tastes like hot water with a brown crayon dipped in it.  Why won't the machine allow you to adjust the grind size? Definitely a case of one gadget trying to do too many things and failing miserably.  We're sticking with our old Krups.;The Coffee Maker That Ruined Christmas
136;139.0;1.0;5.0;This product, which I think is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned, has been returned.  It had some good reviews here - did these folks EVER use the product?\nEach session of use requires you to do about a 20 minute cleaning session, since the steam makes a grimy, sludgy mess in the grinder, and throughout the interal parts of the unit.\nGrounds slip past the included filter, and into the pot.  Its really tall, so it was hard to even get the coffee and water into the machine for my 5' tall wife.  The top wouldn't open while unit was under the cupboards on the counter - it opens UP and so must me moved everytime you want to do anything with it.\nShame on Cuisinart for allowing a product this poor to make it through testing.\nAmazing that such a good compnay could makes such a lousy product.;Eeeewwww...
137;140.0;1.0;5.0;"My husband and I were thoroughly disappointed with this grind and brew coffee maker. No matter what type of whole bean coffee you use, it comes out weak and tasteless.

It is ""pre-set"" to medium grind.";Cuisinart DGB-600BC Grind and Brew--Makes Lousy Coffee

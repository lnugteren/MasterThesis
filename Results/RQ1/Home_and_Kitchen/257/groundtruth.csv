101;1.0;5.0;668.0;"I've had a set of this cookware for 3 years now and use it every day. The best as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSome have complained about how it looks after being used and oxidation occurring saying it's ""flaking"". Stainless Steel is a metal not a coating. I just can't see how it can ""flake"" off. In the research I did on stainless cookware before I chose these I found that it's a common/normal thing that happens with this type cookware.\n\nBar Keepers Friends does a fantastic job of restoring these to like new condition. I use mine every day and I've never done anything to be extra careful while doing so. I got them to cook for my family and that's what I do. These spots don't hinder the function of these at all, it's merely cosmetic. However, having said that if you want your pans to always look brand new and unused and don't want to use a ""toxic"" cleaner I suggest you do what I just did and use plain old household vinegar for the same results. If I can figure out how I will post a photo of before and after a couple minutes of vinegar. I just added a very small amount of vinegar, about 2 T probably, swished it around let it sit for a minute, applied a sponge, rinsed, dried and bam see next photo. Like new shiny. Yes it probably has a few scratches but that too is normal after 3 years of use I'd imagine.";Great Cookware!

At 209 bucks, I really feel like this was a bargain (it's worth 300, realistically), especially with its excellent and beautiful construction. It's try-ply CLAD, which means three layers (Magnetized Stainless, Aluminum Core, 18/10 Stainless) are used throughout the pan, including up the side walls. Note that not all tri-ply cookware is like this; be careful of ""try-ply BASE"" cookware which only uses this setup on the bottom of the pan (they're easy to spot because they have a seam around the base of the pan).\n\nI almost went for the Tramontina Tri-Ply Clad pieces you can pick up for a reasonable price at Wal-Mart, but decided against it as this set looks better visually and includes all the pieces I wanted; finding all the Tramontina pieces I'd need looked like quite a chore.\n\nI didn't believe that I'd be able to cook on such low heat given the fact that my glass electric cooktop has taken so long to cook things in the past, but it really does work great. I pre-heat on level 5 (out of 10) until a water drop ""skates"" on the cooking surface, then back the heat off to 3.5 for a consistent cooking temp. Works great, seems to cook faster than my previous cookware at higher heat, PLUS no warping on any of these pans so they actually lay flat on my range.\n\nIf you understand the pros and cons of cooking in stainless and decide to go with it over non-stick, this set is the one to look at if you want something to last a lifetime.\n\nThe biggest negative for this set is the questionable support. Half of this assertion is based on other peoples' experiences I've read about, and half is for my own experience. I received my set with a dented lid (probably put in the package dented), and Cuisinart's support told me I'd be better off working with Amazon to resolve it since I'd have to pay shipping BOTH WAYS on a defective-out-of-the-box product. He also made sure to place emphasis on the word ""Limited"" in ""Limited Lifetime Warranty"", strongly implying that they reserved the right to not cover certain aspects of failure. Interesting, considering mine had arrived with a defective piece straight away. If you end up needing to use your warranty, be prepared to pay nearly as much in shipping (two ways) as a brand new replacement for the piece.";Excellent Set of Cookware at a Great Price, Questionable Warranty Service
127;3.0;5.0;443.0;"We bought this to broaden our culinary horizons. After my usual weeks of constantly reading into reviews and Youtubing, I decided this HAD to be what I had been searching for. The Cuisinart multiclad pro 12 piece set has turned me into the man of the kitchen I've always wanted to be. The days of ""toss whatever frozen meal bag in a non stick pan and let's eat"" are over for me. The first night we used them on come chicken breast, steamed some carrots, and made a brown sugar glaze for them. The even browning of the multiclad technology was incredible. This set makes me feel like I CAN make more than just something to eat, were actually making delicious meals and it created a ""drive"" to cook better because we know we are capable now! I can now see that stainless steel really does cook food better than non stick. The one thing I really thought would kill me is the pain of cleanup every night. We use this for all of the food we cook daily and as you fellow avid reviewers may have read, Bar Keepers Friend really what you've heard! I've used this skillet daily for a few weeks now and hot water, BKF, and a little scrubbing and they clean up great and HONESTLY quite easily. We've cooked everything with coconut oil and that stuff really makes a great oil. No sticky burnt food, just lightly stuck browned bits that can make a great pan sauce! Which is a great first step to cleaning! Using what you got!\n\nI honestly love this set and it deserves every 4-5 star review its got. You'll love this set.";Narrowed it down to this and a few others? THIS IS THE ONE.
32;4.0;1.0;217.0;"I was a bit skeptical about the rivets issue, believing that a small number of folks simply ended up with a bad batch so I went ahead and ordered the 8 quart stockpot this past Dec 2016. First thing I did was to test whether it had the ""corroding rivets"" issue. Fresh out of the brand new packaging box, I rinsed the inside with water and then filled it with just under 8 quarts of cold tap water, making sure the rivets were submerged. Then I also added 2 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar (a mild acid). I placed it over the stove and turned up the heat until the water temperature was high enough to start a few small bubbles to form on the bottom of the pot (guessing it reached around 150F) then turned off the heat and placed the lid on and allowed it sit for 8 hours. Eight hours later, the results show the rivets did react with the very, very mildly acidic water and vinegar combination. I can feel small pits in the rivets with my fingers and some material has definitely been eroded.\nSave yourself the trouble. Do not buy this pot unless you want to find out on your own - the hard way.\nCuisinart needs to recall this product and check each pot for this defect before it puts it back on sale again.\nThis may be a health and safety issue that warrants such action.";Corroding Rivets Issue is True
219;5.0;5.0;393.0;I was looking for a set of stainless sauce pans to replace my very aged Magnalite aluminum set which has pitted badly.  I wanted fully clad stainless cookware.  I looked at All-Clad Stainless, Cuisinart Multiclad Pro, Calphalon Triply, and the Tramontina Triply.  I wanted a rolled lip to make pouring easier so that eliminated the All-Clad and Tramontina entries.  Not sure which of the remaining two I wanted, I bought one each of the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro and the Calphalon Triply Stainless to test.\n\nAfter using each about a half dozen times, I was pleased with the performance of both.  Neither seems to have any significant performance advantage over the other.  Both heated evenly, were solidly built, and were comfortable to lift and pour. Neither handle heated too much during cooking even after simmering tomato sauce for hours.  The Cuisinart's handle was warmer than the Calphalon but not by much.  I did find the Calphalon slightly easier to clean food that had become stuck to the surface.  However, that was negated by having a third handle rivet to clean around.  Essentially, performance was the same from both lines.  For those that are concerned with the appearance of the cookware, the Cuisinart Multiclad line has a brushed finish.  The Calphalon Triply are polished to a mirror finish.  Both were fine with me as I don't much worry about how they look.\n\nI chose the Cuisinart sauce pans for a few reasons: lids, pan sizes, and price.  I like the Cuisinart's metal lids more than the Calphalon's glass ones.  I don't understand the benefit of glass lids.  They can't take the higher heats that metal can, can break if dropped or banged, and fog up when used so you can't see what's in the pot, anyway.  The sauce pans in the Cuisinart line are available in 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 quart sizes.  That's perfect for my needs.  The Calphalon was availabe in 1, 1.5, 2.5, and 4.5 quart sizes.  I really wanted something in the 3-3.5 quart range since I use it frequently but it is not available from Calphalon.  They do make a 3 quart Chef's pan but I didn't want the curved bottom.  The Cuisinart Multiclad sauce pans are priced approximately 50% less than the Calphalon Triply pans.  Since they performed evenly well, the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro seemed to fit my needs best.;Great Value
65;6.0;5.0;173.0;"As many other reviewers have stated, this item works on induction.  The non-stick surface actually feels ""slicker"" than our expensive MasterClad non-stick.  We have a Bosch induction cooktop but not the model with the bridgeable burners.  I decided to boil some water in the griddle to clean it and discovered that this provided a very good heat coverage map across two burners.  The first picture shows the water starting to boil.  The second picture 60 seconds later shows that the heat transfer of the pan is so efficient that there is an almost unbroken line of ""boiling hot"" metal.  Because of this I expect that on lower pancake, egg, or crepe type heats we will get a very good experience.  Also note the orange border underneath the griddle.  This is a Silpat silcone mat, also available on Amazon.  Prevents the griddle from slipping and protects the ceramic surface.  The burners were set on highest setting for this boil test.  So thumbs up on the griddle and highly recommend the silicone mat for protection and slippage elimination when cooking.";Works Great on Induction!  Nice Quality!
6;7.0;5.0;7.0;"I decided to wait for a while to write this review as I wanted to use them for at least a few weeks prior to rating and reviewing.  Keep in mind this is my first set of stainless steel cookware I've ever used so I can't really compare them to other stainless steel sets.  I've only used numerous types/styles of non-stick sets.  Teflon, ceramic, ""green pan"", copper chef, etc.  (I've never actually BOUGHT a set of cookware until I bought these, all of the others have been gifts of some sort).\n\nI was trying to decide between these or a set that Calphalon were heavily discounting at the time (a set with copper on the outside, stainless on the inside, aluminum core), but out of all the comparisons and other reviews, I chose these instead mainly because the copper would most likely tarnish and get unevenly ugly.  Also America's Test Kitchen tested sauce pans.  The winner being All-clad of course was WELL out of my price range.  Their next recommendation though was the Cuisinart Multiclad unlimited, and I figured those should perform similar to these.\n\nPros\nStainless steel - with care will last a lifetime and more\nHeats very evenly and quickly\nThe tapered rim really does make pouring MUCH easier and practically drip free (I always have a paper towel handy regardless)\nCooked eggs without sticking (yeah, you read that right)\nCooking is much more predictable\n\nCons\nThe cookware do ""stain"" but can be removed\nMust be very diligent with proper preheating and not overheating\nParts of the cookware is a high mirror polish (more on why I put this as a con later)\nCould be sensitive to temperature shock (but then again, MOST if not all cookware is)\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the cons\n""Stains"" can occur on the cooking surface, especially if you get some stuck food (some food sticking is normal, it's called fond, don't be discouraged by it).  After giving it a good soap and water bath with a plastic scrub sponge I've noticed light colored ""whitish"" marks on the cookware.  Honestly this isn't a problem, but it does trigger my OCD to want the pans to look clean.  Nothing a little Bon Ami/Bar Keepers Friend can't fix.  Just don't really recommend doing this often as these are minor abrasives.  This leads me to...\n\nMirror like finish in spots.  I honestly wish all of the surface had the brushed look to it.  Once you use Bon Ami/Bar Keepers friend on the upper parts of the cooking surface or elsewhere, you'll get swirl marks. This is just once again my OCD of wanting to keep my brand new set looking brand new.  They WILL scratch and get swirls and other stuff.  But the mirror finish only makes it that much worse.  It obviously won't change the performance of the cookware.\n\nPreheating/overheating.  These pans can heat up QUICK (ymmv depending on your stove type, mine is electric with exposed element), even on medium.  Because of this you really need to make sure you aren't overheating the pan while preheating.  Overheat can/will lead to badly stuck/burned food.  This is going to be typical of pretty much any multiclad/all clad stainless steel cookware.  If you don't like this, stick with hard anodized or something of the sort.\n\nTemperature shock.  Honestly this should go without saying, but really the last thing you want to do is go from cooking to putting this under cold water.  I've seen reviews (from pros using this specific cookware) where they have done this and the pan was fine.  But really, you seriously run the risk of warping ANY cookware doing this.  Just.....don't do it.\n\nTime for the pros\nStainless steel - Really, there's not much to say here.  Because the outer and inner surfaces are stainless steel, as long as you're not abusing the pans, they'll last forever.  There isn't a non-stick surface that slowly turns turns into a reason for throwing it out.\n\nHeats evenly/quickly - The fact that these have an aluminum core sandwiched by stainless steel really helps these pans heat up quick and even.  I've made frittata and numerous other things and get a pretty consistent cook throughout the entire thing (it would help if my stove top were more level but there's little I can do about that without replacing the entire top, the whole stove is level).\n\nTapered rim - I've poured out sauces, soups bacon grease, etc.  It all pours out really easy and smooth.  I can't 100% comment on it being drip free as I always have a paper towel or something handy to wipe the edge.  Force of habit.\n\nCooked eggs without sticking - Yeah I've read numerous reviews saying that eggs stick like crazy to these.  It's the one thing that made me wait 2 weeks prior to even think about cooking eggs, let alone over easy eggs on these.  I can safely say that eggs swirl around on these pans just as good as any perfectly new non-stick pan.  Granted you need to make sure you heat the pan just right and prep it.  I haven't tried putting eggs in with JUST butter yet but I would imagine it would work.  Usually I'll put a about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of canola oil in the pre heated pan and use a paper towel to cover the surface and the sides, let it sit for a few seconds, then put a little butter in the bottom.  I have yet to have any eggs stick at all.  In fact, I threw out my old 8"" non-stick I kept around specifically for eggs.\n\nCooking predictable - Because the pans heat evenly and they're super conductive, cooking because so much more predictable and you use much less heat.  On my old pans, I'd usually cook most things on medium high.  I've found medium with these has been equivalent.  Polenta, rice, etc all cook really nicely because you can just set the heat to low and just let it go.  At first I was a bit worried about the lids not being see through (as I've always had glass lids) but now I've come to not care.\n\nAll in all every single time I cook with this cookware, I always find myself saying ""I Love these pans!!!"".  I have yet to have food ""stick"" to them.  At least to the point where it's destroying the food.  The only thing I haven't tried are fish and pancakes, but I would imagine pancakes would stick regardless.  If you're having a problem with all your food sticking, you're doing it wrong.  You're most likely over heating the pan.  Watch some youtube vids about proper use of stainless steel cookware and you should be able to figure it out.";Absolutely love this set!
51;8.0;5.0;142.0;"Update at end on how to clean them - Jan 2017\nJust gorgeous!  When I first took these out of the box I felt like they were too fancy for just cooking in my house. I really did! They are SO nice. I can't stress on the nice part enough. I've worked in restaurants for over 15 years I've never seen pans this nice before but at same time I feel like this is what a fancy restaurant would be using. These pans are heavy, solid, and look like they will last a really long time.\nIt was  scary going from non stick to stainless steel,  most of the information out there will say stainless is better, will last longer, and cook better. I'm sure many of you reading these reviews feel the same way. There's so many options and price points it's hard decided on one set.\nIt's been a few months cooking with this set. I've had ups and downs (more like a learning curve) but I'm still glad I got these.\nMaybe 2X's month I will get out the vinegar and wipe them down to get the shine & new look back. My husband has bad habit of using a fork with pans when he makes dinner (I know! Don't get me started). They have few scratches now (not bad). I've read you don't need to have the heat as high with these but when I boil water I don't feel that is true. If it's not on high the water will take a really really long time to get to a boil. I've had a few mishaps while making hard boiled eggs. I feel I use the 10 inch pans the most.  I actually perfer the higher side to other. It also has more cooking surface (to me). The small pan gets not much use. You can cook one egg in it, can cook two but they will be stuck together.  When we make pasta dishes the big pan almost can't hold a 16 oz box pasta (adding once it's cooked) hubs makes this amazing spicy sausage & shrimp dish that he likes to always remind me the old pans could 'hold' it better. I still wouldn't go back to old non stick pans. This was big scary purchase but I'm really  happy with this product.  Highly recommended,  I don't feel it needs the small pan but maybe others have more use of it.\n\nUpdate: so the pans are getting lots use still. Still don't use that small one very often but the last time hubs used it. I could not get it clean. No amount of elbow grease or vinegar would do it. So I asked around and got ""bar keepers friend"", It feels a bit like Ajax but overall it's amazing stuff. I've used it on pans, counters, glass flat top stove. I ordered off Amazon got 3 for $10.";Been using over a year & still look new.
247;9.0;5.0;207.0;"I ordered this set due to a great deal that was offered a few weeks back, making the set more affordable than the older model.  This model, MCP-12N is the new version (with improved handle shaping and placement-I contacted Cuisinart to ask about the difference) of the MCP-12.  I've always had cheap model Revereware, or bought scratch and dent pans from stores.  This is the first nice set of cookware I've ever purchased.  I was skeptical because I read ALL reviews on the older model.  There were some negative ones, and I was leary.  While affordable, they are still priced higher than what I'm used to buying. Oh-about price; I checked several places and Amazon's price has yet to be beat.\n\nI was provided an estimated delivery date between the first and second week of November. Then Amazon sent me an email last week stating the pots would be available sooner.  They arrived this past Monday, and I LOVE them!  I've only cooked 3 meals so far, but I've used quite a bit of the pots to do so.  The lids are awesome--light, easy to hold because the handle bends high (your knuckles don't touch the hot lid), and they seal wonderfully while cooking.  I have a smooth-top stove and these are working great.  On other reviews from the older model, I saw complaints about sticking but I have not had that problem.  I have cooked eggs, sausage, veggies, I've steamed veggies in the steamer insert...etc.  I have experienced no problems, and only use a light spray of olive or canola spray. I have no spots, no stains, no discoloration so far.  I did grab barkeepers friend from the store (sorry Amazon, but that stuff is much cheaper in the stores than online) based on other review suggestions but I don't need it yet.  These are so easy to clean.\n\nThe construction of this cookware is wonderful.  They are sturdy, the handles are very sturdy (and the long handles really do stay cool on the stove top, but the ""helper"" handles get hot if you are boiling/steaming with a lid on).  They are heavy enough to show their great construction and material, but not too heavy to handle and move between stove, sink, cabinets, etc.  I highly recommend this set - especially if you are looking for a higher quality cookeware, but can't pay $600 - over $1000 for some.  I was fortunate to grab these at a lower price than currently showing today.  I will definitely purchase add on cookware from the Multi-Clad Pro line to add to my collection as I need. I see there are nice multi-use pots/pans from this line and I can't wait to build my set.  The set in this offer is wonderful and has everything you need.";So pleased!
19;10.0;1.0;56.0;I am so dissapointed. I just moved and decided to splurge on a nice set of stainless steel cookware. They look amazing and are nice and heavy, I was so excited to cook with them. I am an experienced cook, The food came out great and the pots cleaned super easy, BUT then I looked at the pan. It looks like a layer of film is peeling off the surface of the pan. Sigh. I thought it was maybe just a defect in one pan so the next day I cooked some pasta in a different pot from the set. after cleaning the pot and looking in it, once again it looks like a layer of the pot is coming off. I am afraid to use any of the other pots and pans in the set, I'm worried that whatever is coming off could be harmfull to me and my family. Such a shame because other than this huge defect, the cookware set is beautiful.;Major problem with the set I recieved
163;11.0;2.0;135.0;The pots / sauce pans had issues - the metal on the bottom flaked/pitted the first time I used each of them.  I can't tell for sure, but it looks like the inner layer of steel is very thin and has detached from the aluminum core in some places.\n\nIf it were just one of them, it would be understandable - lemons happen.  However, in this case it was both sauce pans and the stockpot.\n\nThe issue doesn't seem to impact the useability, but it sure makes them look ugly.\n\nHowever, the skillets are excellent, as is the saute pan - I could not be happier with them.  I was concerned about the handles getting hot, but that has never been an issue.  The lid for the 3 1/2 quart saute pan (and the 8 quart stock pot) fits the 10 inch skillet, which can be useful for some cooking techniques.;The bottom of the pots will flake

3;13.0;5.0;176.0;Actually, this is one of the best roasting pans I've come across at any price. It's  3-ply aluminum core construction. The edge is slightly beveled so it looks thinner than it is, but after taking a micrometer to it, it is actually only about 15% thinner than some of the $200+ models - still quite heavy duty. It has a nice dead flat bottom, doesn't warp, is induction friendly, has great handles and a nice rack. Perfect size, just wide enough for a 20 lbs turkey. It also takes 500 degree heat very well. Plus, it's really beautiful! I compared about 10 roasters and I would have bought this one even if it was $200. Do not confuse this pan with Cuisinart's non Multiclad model. This is a hard to find item that is a great deal.;The Best Roaster Overall
195;14.0;1.0;131.0;Bought this set for myself on Mother's Day. :)\n\nThe set arrived about one week earlier than the Amazon-specified delivery date. (I shipped it overseas.)\n\nThe set is very beautiful and heavy. The first time I used it (10-inch skillet), the food got stuck a bit, but it's because I wasn't very good at using stainless steel to cook. I actually started to learn how to deglaze my sautee pan and so on, and it's been great experimenting and learning new recipes. I also made small omelets for my 2 year-old son with the 8-inch skillet, and they do not stick to the pan at all. (Note: heat the skillet first, then add some butter and heat it, then add the eggs.... Cooks beautifully.)\n\nCleaning is very easy and fast. I wash with warm water and soap with a wash cloth, nothing abrasive, then towel dry. There are some mineral spots (the water in my area is quite mineral-heavy), but it's a minor issue. I do not use Barkeepers Friend. So far I've not had any reason to do so.\n\nI'll update my review after I use the set for a while.\n\nUPDATE AFTER 1 WEEK OF USE:\n\nI'm reducing the rating by one star because the set scratches so easily. I don't use any metal utensils, just wooden and plastic spatulas, and I can see scratches all over some of the pots and pans. I can't decide what I want to do about it yet. A part of me wants to return, but another part of me wonders if the replacement set will scratch easily as well.\n\nUPDATE AFTER 2 WEEKS:\n\nI have no choice but to return this set. I can't believe the pots are pitted after only a couple of uses -- mostly to boil water or to heat cream-based soup! I have no idea if it's normal or not. I always used medium or low heat w/ the set. I'm very disappointed. Cuisinart CS was not helpful. I'll buy a set from a different maker.;Disappointing Performance and Quality Was: Good Value, Good Performance
72;15.0;1.0;81.0;"I have used a Cuisinart MultiClad Pro set for more than 15 years and loved it--still use it every day! It has been through any manner of recipes and countless cycles of the dishwasher and looks as good as the day I bought it. Boy has the quality of their products gone downhill since then! After only one use of this pot, the rivets turned BLACK! I thought maybe it was a coating or something and used a scotchbrite pad and that gouged the rivets! They couldn't possible be stainless steel! I contacted cuisinart and they sent a new pot--same problem! Now here's the thing, the rivets on the lid that came with it are fine...no discoloration, they are shiny and hard just like my 15 year-old set. Its clearly a manufacturing problem with the rivets on the pot. Very sad.\n\nUPDATE: The pot comes with a ""lifetime warranty"", and I've had it replace four times--a total of five pots--and every single one of them had the same problem to a varying degree. Oddly, every time I contacted customer service, they would ask, ""did you put salt in before you boil water""???? What? First, I didn't buy this pot to boil water, I cook in it. Second, if they are suggested the pot has a problem boiling water...Anyway, I sprung for a similar All Clad....Williams Sonoma was having a sale and I had an old gift card from a friend. I'm sure it will be worth every penny over the years.";Very Dissapointed
28;16.0;5.0;57.0;"I'm a cast iron enthusiast, have a set of vintage ""users"" as my primary cooking set.  But unfortunately, cast iron isn't the best choice for everything.  Dishes with acidic ingredients like tomatoes, citrus, and wine will eat away the seasoning you build up on cast iron which protects it and gives it non-stick properties.\n\nBut for those situations where cast iron is inappropriate, I'm no longer comfortable using my old non-stick anodized aluminum pans, for health reasons. If you're reading this, you likely have the same concerns and already decided on stainless steel, are wondering whether to get this one or another brand.\n\nGet this one.\n\nThe top two brands are All Clad and Cuisinart, all others fall short in one way or another.  All Clad are made in the USA, and you pay for that.  Cuisinart are made in China, but this is one example where the product is of comparable quality.  It really comes down to whether or not you think the Made in USA aspect is worth up to twice the price.\n\nThe difference between this one (MCP22-30HCN) and the similar MCP22-30HN is this one comes with a matching lid while the other does not.\n\nConstruction - these have three layers running throughout the skillet, both bottom and sides.  Inner layer / cooking surface is 18/10 (aka 304 grade) stainless steel, the gold standard for stainless steel kitchenware (316 grade is more corrosion resistant but there's no advantage in the kitchen, only marine environments).  Middle layer is aluminum for heat conductivity (SS by itself is a poor conductor).  Outer layer is 18/0 stainless steel, which is magnetic for induction stove compatibility.  The middle aluminum layer is completely encapsulated and does not come in contact with food.  Handles are cast SS and of a design that stay cool while in use.  Lid is all SS.  Overall slightly more hefty than non-stick ano aluminum but much lighter than modern cast iron.\n\nCooking - the aluminum core distributes heat quickly and evenly.  You really can effectively cook using a lower heat setting than you would with non-stick ano aluminum, and you get better results with this pan that way.  Stainless steel is NOT non-stick, doesn't matter which brand, but using the lower heat setting along with cooking oil will make sticking minimal.  For something like a fried egg, though, you'll be better off with a well-seasoned cast iron skillet.\n\nCleaning - it comes with a cleaning guide, which states that after you finish cooking with it, fill it with hot water, add some dishsoap, then let it cool to room temperature while you do your other dishes.  This has been surprisingly effective, with a quick scrub using a blue non-scratch scrubbing sponge being sufficient to finish the job.  If you get some discoloration on the cooking surface, that's likely hard water stains which are easily and quickly removed with a little white vinegar, also as stated in the included cleaning guide.  Anything else you can't get off can be removed using Bar Keeper's Friend (a widely available cleaning product), but you typically won't need to use that unless you're just burning everything to carbon all the time.  It's also dishwasher safe though that will create more wear over time.  Overall, not a challenge to clean if you follow the instructions.\n\nThe 12-piece MultiClad Pro set MCP-12N is by far the best value to get into this product line but it does not include a 12"" skillet, only 8"" and 10"".  If you, like me, often have a need for a 12"" skillet, this item is perfect as a supplement to that set or a standalone piece. Recommended.";It doesn't get any better, just more expensive

126;18.0;1.0;95.0;I purchased this set based on the great reviews and description that said they are 18/10 stainless steel. I called Cusinart to confirm they were 18/10 after reading other reviews saying they were not. Cuisinart did confirm they were not 18/10 but had no idea what type they are. After a week they finally told me they are 201 serious steel which is basically cheaper quality because they replace the nickel with magnesium  and it's less expensive for them to make and makes the pans more likely to corrode. Amazon was apologetic and is replacing them with the Cooks Standard 18/10 clad set. Buy a different set!;BUYER BEWARE THIS IS NOT 18/10 STEEL
209;19.0;1.0;119.0;"I really wanted to like this pan. The three-ply construction sounds great. It looks like a very serious cooking tool with the brushed stainless exterior. Unfortunately, the execution on this pan leaves much to be desired.\n\nMy first use of the new pan was cooking some pasta. From watching the water come up to temperature I could tell the pan had excellent heat dispersion. There were virtually no hot spots from the gas flame. Cleaning the pan after cooking the pasta I noticed what looked like spots where something had stuck to the bottom of the pan. I scrubbed a little harder and still they wouldn't come out. Upon closer inspection I realized it wasn't stuck on pasta but several spots where the inner layer of stainless steel had flaked away. I know virtually nothing of metallurgy, but that inner layer of stainless looks awfully thin to me. And it clearly hasn't been properly adhered to the aluminum core if it flakes off after simply boiling water in the pan.\n\nI notified Amazon of the defect and they immediately sent out a replacement. I used the new pan to again cook some pasta. First use and the stainless inner layer begins to flake.\n\nOne defective pan might be a fluke. Two defective pans in a row and I have to think Cuisinart has a serious design or manufacturing defect. Personally, I think they've scrimped too much on the stainless steel, making the inner layer way too thin. I do know I've had two pans fail on the very first use under far less than strenuous conditions. If the pan can't boil water under a medium flame without literally falling apart, there's a serious issue.\n\nI've posted photos of both pans so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about. In both cases there is significant discoloration of the stainless surrounding the spots that have flaked off. A couple of the spots are about 1/16"" diameter. You'll probably have to zoom the photos, but the bad spots should be easy to see.\n\nIf you're looking for cookware that looks attractive hanging in your kitchen, this might be your ticket. If you want something that will last for decades, I'd keep on looking.";Looks good, very poor execution
239;20.0;1.0;118.0;I needed a new roaster and decided to go with the MultiClad after doing a lot of research. It seemed like a good option and when it arrived, I was impressed with its design and heft. It's definitely sturdy enough for stovetop use, and the handles were great. Everything seemed wonderful, but then I used it. After cooking one turkey, I was washing the roaster and noticed several places on the inside (cooking surface) where the stainless steel had flaked off. I own a lot of stainless steel cookware, so I know the drill: no salt and hand washing. Yet, that didn't stop this thing from pitting like crazy. Even worse, there were big chunks missing from different areas of the roaster, which was much more disheartening than just some little black spots. I've never seen this happen before. I'm perplexed because the item seemed to be a good quality product. I guess not.\n\nI am beyond disappointed. I thought I was investing in a roaster that would serve us for years to come, but it couldn't even make it through one use.;Stainless Steel Coating Flaked After One Use
256;21.0;5.0;121.0;My wife was dropping serious hints about an AllClad roasting pan.  The AllClad is painfully expensive, so I turned up this Cuisinart in my research, and compared it with the Calphalon that was top-rated by a respectable cooking magazine.  This unit has the tri-ply construction, like the AllClad, and the handles don't sit over the interior of the pan, which could be problematic as you are lifing a roast out of the oven.  The bottom line is my wife is very happy with the pan, and it was reasonably priced.;Why pay more?

193;23.0;1.0;89.0;I ordered this back in November for Thanksgiving. The pan I received had some scratching in the interior when I received it. Where the stainless steel plating had chipped off you could see black underneath. Not sure what process they are using for their try-ply, but it needs work. I was pleased with the size, weight, and other features of the pan, including the stainless rack.\n\nI thought I could get past the scratch inside, as it was rather small. But after using the rack for roasting our turkey, when I cleaned up the pan, I noticed the rack left loads of scratched plating where you could see through to the black underneath, just like the original scratch. This was after once use. Also, there was some very small pock marks--pitting. I had no choice but to use it for Thanksgiving and then send it back.\n\nI have since had pitting problems with my other Cuisinart Multi-clad pots I own. These problems did not show up at first, but took around 6-months of almost daily use to show. I suspect most people writing reviews here either aren't looking very closely for pitting and scratching, or write their laudatory reviews after one or two uses.\n\nSadly, I cannot recommend any of the multi-clad line due to these problems. It's a shame, because I love everything else about the product.;Scratches and pits easily. Avoid.

I don't have much of a background with iron pans and didn't want to deal with seasoning one (same issue with carbon steel).  My cooktop does not have the bridge and is 30"" wide so most iron or carbon steel options were too big.  This fits over the two burners beautifully - I won't say that it is not hotter over the burners but the heat does get distributed pretty well - I have made pancakes, french toast, tortillas, and grilled cheese sandwiches on the griddle and the center area cooks fine too.  I also like that it is pretty nice looking so I actually leave it out.  I had been searching on and off for years for a griddle like this - had almost settled for carbon steel and I am so happy I didn't.\n\nUpdate - still extremely happy and use it all the time.

I use the medium sized pot with the steamer a few times a week to cook rice and veggies at the same time.  Having that option really saves some time, and the hassle of dealing with another setup/ cleanup.  As you can see, the pot still looks brand new on the inside with minimal pitting and scratching.  The other one I use the most is the smaller pan.  I cook eggs with it every morning because it is the perfect size for two eggs overeasy.  Despite using it everyday its in astounding shape (check out the pic), I am very impressed with the quality of the stainless steel Cuisinart uses.  I am not sure I will ever need that lifetime warranty with this set :).\n\nAs you can see from the pictures, despite burning several meals - I'm a semi-pro cook ;) - these pots and pans won't ever hold the burn marks or stain.

You won't be sorry.\n\nI like this pot. It is superior in many respects to my collection of the original All-Clad (stainless steel over anodized aluminum). What you need to know:\n\n* Unlike lower priced models, the layering goes all the way up the sides. an important feature.\n* Unlike higher priced models it does not have a layer of copper.\n* The handles (sides and lid) stay reasonably cool. No potholders required.\n* The lid is tighter fitting than it appears to be.\n* Maintaining the mirror finish on the interior requires treating it like Teflon. However, scratches would have no effect on performance.\n\nI measure performance by heat retention and heat distribution. Over the last few days I have made mussels meuniere and chili. I was very pleased.\n\nThe pot is easy to clean without steel wool. If anything does stick (thus far it has not), you can boil it away with some detergent added to the water.

108;30.0;3.0;47.0;Initially I was impressed by the price and quality of this cookware, and they sat perfectly flat and heated up nice and evenly. However, after a couple weeks I noticed that my skillets were warping to the point that they no longer sat flat on my ceramic cooktop and there was about 1mm of gap on one side of the pan when sitting on a flat surface. I always used low heat and never put water on them while they were still hot. I contacted Cuisinart about getting a warranty replacement after the first skillet became warped. The process was slow and a little frustrating, and I was unimpressed that I had to mail them a check for shipping before they would send me a replacement. After I noticed the second skillet beginning to warp I decided to return the set to Amazon for a complete refund.\n\nIf using a gas range these may be just fine, but if you have a ceramic cooktop I'd recommend getting something else unless you're not very picky about having perfectly flat bottoms on your cookware. After doing some research I discovered that I was not the only person to experience this issue. I didn't have any issues with the sauce pans warping.;Nice, but not for Ceramic Cooktops
92;31.0;5.0;39.0;"I had a couple of All Clad pieces that I loved, and was in the market to replace all of my other cookware with an All Clad set. I'm glad that I decided to research other options, because I love the Cuisinart MCP pieces even more than my All Clad.\n\nAfter doing some research I discovered that there are basically two kinds of tri ply cookware; those who are fully clad and those who only have cladding on the bottom. Most of the other tri ply options on the market, specifically the inexpensive ones like Tramontina and Kirkland, use only bottom cladding. Cookware that is only cladded on the bottom can cause scorching if something touches the uncladded side. The Cuisinart MCP cookware is fully clad.\n\nFrom the day I got my All Clad pieces, the one thing that irked me about them is that the handles are obscenely uncomfortable. It's a small price to pay for quality so I just rolled with it. The Cuisinart MCP set has much more comfortable handles.\n\nAs far as workmanship, materials, and overall quality feel of Cuisinart MCP compared to All Clad; I'd say that it's very close if not even. The only place that I can see a difference is quality between my All Clad and Cuisinart pieces is in the lids. The All Clad kids feel a bit heavier in the hand, but the Cuisinart MCP lids still perform equally well. One edge I would give to Cuisinart is that the handles on the lids arch much higher than the All Clad, which keeps my knuckles from getting burned as they have been so many times on my All Clad.\n\nI cook on a gas range, and although I'm sure that my All Clad pieces would perform better in a scientific comparison with heat mapping equipment, I can't find a difference in performance at all. The Cuisinart MCP pieces have fantastically even heat distribution, just like my All Clad.\n\nConclusion:\nI like Cuisinart's handle and lid design much better than All Clad. I was unable to find a difference in overall quality and performance between Cuisinart and All Clad. The fully cladded Cuisinart MCP is offered at a price point only slightly higher than bottom cladded brands like Tramontina, and costs one third of the price of an All Clad set. I think this set is a no brainier, go buy it.";Better than All Clad in some ways

Well, perhaps you want a non-stick rack and if you do, this might not be the roasting pan to buy. The included rack is stainless steel, not non-stick. This means you need to spend 5 seconds with a can non-stick spray before using, but it also means the finish is never going to wear off. Not a big deal to me. And yes, I did receive the right model. I checked the model number on Cuisinart's website where it shows it having a stainless steel rack as well.

The only thing she didn't like was that the lid handles get very hot (her old set had plastic handles that stayed cool). Just a matter of remembering to grab a pot holder to remove the lid. The pots polish up very nice with Bar Keeper's Friend, which effortlessly removes any discoloration that some reviewers have complained about. We use microfiber dishtowels to dry them and give them a final buffing. It is also important to use wooden utensils because they will scratch. Due to the great heat distribution it has never been necessary to use anything higher than medium high heat.  After one year of use they still look and perform like new. Another nice feature is the pouring lip, which the French version of these pots didn't have. Nice, even, spill proof pouring every time.

109;35.0;5.0;38.0;"I could not be happier with this set and the multi-clad product line in general. I spent a lot of time researching the different brands and their product lines and what to look for in cookware. I replaced a set of the all-aluminum Calphalon that were so hot in the 90s (pun intended) but were completely destroyed and, as a result, I barely used them. Then we renovated our kitchen and I found myself compelled to cook.\n\nI decided on stainless early (i.e. dishwasher safe, durable, cooktop-oven-table flexibility, no toxic coatings, etc.) and figured I would eventually pick up cast iron and non-stick pans for their more specific benefits. I also read that 18/10 stainless steel is the best. I am a research first, then buy quality type and am willing to spend more for what I believe to be a more value-added product. The Cuisinart Chefs Classic line was my baseline because it fit the above requirements and was a great price. Then I started researching in earnest.\n\nI discovered that an aluminum and/or copper core that went up the entire side of the pot/pan would be an improvement over one with the conductive metal in the bottom only, which is how the Chefs Classic line is made. I felt that this was worth the additional cost (and I was right).\n\nMy manufacturer search started with what many believe is the gold standard, All-Clad. Its an excellent product but in the end I couldn't justify spending the equivalent of a down payment on a car on a set of cookware. Calphalon was next and, although less expensive, they are still a lot of money. The Cuisinart multi-clad cookware line kept coming up as an alternative so I dove into researching the positives and negatives. I couldn't find any other than that they are made in China so I dove in.\n\nIn short this cookware is amazing and has me cooking things I never thought I would try otherwise. As with anything, there is a (very) small learning curve using this cookware. I have a gas cooktop and here is what I learned. You will find all of these lessons learned in other reviews and although they may be academic to many, I had to learn them for myself.\n\n1. You will not have to use anything hotter than medium-low to medium unless you are boiling water. For that, medium-high is plenty hot. The pans are tremendous at heating evenly and retain heat in the entire pot/pan; cooking the food on all sides.\n2. When you boil water, don't put salt the cold water. Wait until it boils. Salt will make pits in the surface (this set of pots escaped this mistake, but my old stainless steel pot from Ik*a suffered my ignorance)\n3. Use a pan thats sized for the food you are cooking. It helps control how much oil you use, makes it easier to manipulate the food in the pan and it will cook the food faster. Bigger isn't better.\n4. Warm the pan on your cooktop without anything in it for a few minutes then flick some water droplets in it. If they skate across the surface like mercury its ready for the oil/butter.\n5. Use just enough oil to coat the bottom and the sides an inch or so, so you can use them while you are cooking.\n6. The oil is ready for food when it starts to ripple. If it starts to ripple really fast and/or starts to smoke, turn down the heat. Less is definitely more here. At this point you have basically created a non-stick surface on the skillets almost semi-polished finish. Pork chops, fried eggs, etc. slide around without scalding and make cleanup a breeze. I would rather add an extra 120 calories to a dish that serves four using a tablespoon of olive oil than have flakes of Teflon in my food. 40 calories is not a savings  in my book, and I have to watch what I eat. I also have no desire to treat cookware with kid gloves. I did that for 17 years with the Calphalon I replaced.\n7. These pans do not need to be seasoned by baking them in the oven or on the cooktop with a high heat oil. Please, please, please know this is not necessary. I did it and found my brand new, sparkling pans covered in what only can be described as a coat of inpenetrable motor oil. Up the sides, on the handles, everywhere. I thought they were ruined. Which leads me to my research on cleanup.\n8. 95% of the time dishwashing liquid and water when the pan is still a bit warm will clean it right up. Sometimes just a little warm water does the trick and the small bit of oil left on the pan makes it a little more non-stick for the next time. Cameo stainless steel cleaner and Bar Keepers Friend are amazing for thick layers of tough burned on food. They also remove scorch marks on the bottom from the burners being too hot. Serious scrubbing with these made my brand new pans look new again. Amazingly, no surfaces were harmed during that workout.\n9. Rainbow hues and water scales (we have scaly water in Chicago) disappear with some distilled vinegar. I hear club soda does the trick too, but I use that for cocktails.\n\nFinally, I did supplement this set with the 5  qt. casserole (MCP55-30N) as I needed a larger pan. I read a review here that the casserole and saute pans are the same except the saute pan has a handle as opposed to two grips. She was right and it does make it easier to use, cleanup and store. I also won't bother buying non-stick and cast iron pans, since Ive mastered using this cookware. This cookware has made me a much better cook and made the whole cooking process easier.";Quality, Durability and Price Point - You Can't Go Wrong

16;37.0;5.0;16.0;"I am a serious cook and take my pans seriously. I have All Clad pans at home that I collected over the years and had the stainless steel Cuisinart pans at my Mom's where we often cook for her. The Cuisinart Stainless Steel pans just did not cut it for me so when another family member declared their love for them, I used it as an opportunity to upgrade. I had hoped for a small All Clad set but quelled at the price. These pans are a wonderful option! They are not the same as All Clad but to be honest, I have a hard time justifying $1,000 more for the functional difference. I know they are made in China, I just had to let that one go. I could not afford the difference. (If you do want similar pans not made in China, the Cuisinart French Chef set is EU made and a nice alternative). On the plus side, the handles are very nice, I wish my All Clad had equally nice ones. I also adore the size of the saute pan. It is deeper than standard so I tossed things out less. I cooked a large pot of sauteed cabbage with a cream sauce in it and nothing stuck or jumped out. I was very pleased with the heat-to-no-scorch ratio with the sauce. On the negative side, if you can say comparing $240 pan set to a $1299 pan set is fair, the pans are not quite as sturdy as the All Clad and they don't clean up quite as easily. For example, when I steamed rice, it came out of the pan in a nice ""cake"" but there was a hint of the rice pattern left on the pan which required scrubbing. My All Clad would have come clean in the dishwasher. The lids are clearly not as sturdy but they function. I think there would be a much smaller margin of ""oops error"" if you over heated the pan but I don't know that and hope never to find out!

10;39.0;5.0;10.0;These are some quality items. They're heavy and feel solidly built. Waaaay cheaper than All Clad, which is why I settled on this brand. So far I've used the steamer, the large pot, the small pot, and the saut pan, making a variety of foods like custard, gravy, pasta, pasta sauce, veggies. I haven't had any problems. I did quite a bit of research about stainless steel before using them, though. Most people who write negative reviews clearly just have no idea how to cook with them and try using them like cheap nonstick pans. It seems like only a minority of reviewers actually received something defective. I feel like I shouldn't have to include the following information, but obviously it's necessary as people aren't doing the research themselves:\n\nThe trick is to let the skillets or saut pan heat up completely, then add butter, swirl it around, then add whatever you're cooking. The food should not stick. Mine didn't. If you're boiling water, let the water come to a full boil before adding salt, otherwise the bottom of the pan could become pitted from the salt. Try not to use metal utensils as these will scratch the stainless steel. I use wooden and silicone utensils with mine. These are dishwasher safe, but if the pans are knocking around against other dishes, this could also lead to scratching. Some discoloration can occur from food sticking and burning (which, again, shouldn't happen if you're using the above method). Some can occur from chemicals in the water wherever you're living (you probably can't help that one, but it's still not the pan's fault). Some can occur on the bottom of the pan if you're using extra high heat (I've never had to go above a medium/medium-high heat setting). If plain old dish soap isn't cutting it, try bar keepers friend and a heavy duty sponge like Jetz-Scrubs, both available on Amazon.\n\nYes, people, it requires some work, some effort. But so does good cooking. It requires some time and attention, and if you just want to cobble something together on the stove and walk away and leave it there, these probably are not for you. But if you want to take your cooking to the next level, then these are worth it. These feel like they'll last a long time, and from other reviewers it looks like they do. Take care of your pots and pans and you shouldn't have a problem.;Major kitchen upgrade

60;42.0;1.0;25.0;I've used this set for a full year now and I can't wait to replace it!\n\nThe biggest issue: The rivet buttons for the handles on the cookware and lids are corroding and rusting, I am sure it's not harmful (I can't find info on it no matter how I phrased it on Google and we feel fine so I am assuming it's calcium or lime build up?) and I am not a total priss but these white crusty knobs with rust around the edges are getting really disturbing. I have cookware pieces from at least 3 other sets and some of them are super cheap random things of a useful size I inherited from my mother and none of them have this issue. Even with Barkeepers Friend Cleaning powder and special scrubbing pads that we have used since day one, this set is much harder to keep clean and after only a year they are showing more signs wear and tear on their surface than my mother's 50yr old pots that have survived several generations of abuse from babies and newbie cooks.\n\nAbout the only good thing I can say about this set is the sizes of everything is perfect! This might sound like a small thing but it's really kinda huge. Perhaps this set is all standard sizes for the types of pots and pans but I am upgrading from an oddball mix I inherited from several family members so each lid would fit only one pot or pan and no other, which sucked, and the burners on the range never lined up with the bottom of the cookware properly there was always some weird over or underlap going on.\n\nAlso something to consider: I thought the solid metal lids would be no big deal but after a couple uses I wanted my old glass lids back! Didn't realize how much I had liked that feature til it was gone.;Major Buyers Remorse!

And it's made in China.\nI'm curious as to why the description states 18/10 stainless. There have been numerous complaints in the reviews, yet Amazon won't re-word the description. I would give zero stars if possible.\nI opted for Viking (the made in the USA, 3-ply line). More expensive, but wonderful cookware.;Misleading product description.
22;46.0;1.0;16.0;The first and only thing I did with this pot was boil salted water and pasta. I was careful that the gas flame stayed under the pan and not around it, that's pan care 101. After cooking with and cleaning the pot according to directions, I noticed several light spots of pitting on the inside bottom of the saucepan. Several passes with Barkeeper's Friend did nothing, several soaks with vinegar did nothing. The whitish pits remain.\nI have several Cuisinart cookware products, large and small. Many have lasted over a decade of use and still look fantastic. I've never seen this happen before. I can only guess that these pans are imperfectly manufactured but made it past the inspection process.\n\nI'll be replacing this saucepan with a similar product from Calphalon or All-Clad with thicker, more robust multiclad construction.

211;48.0;5.0;38.0;I really wanted a high quality induction ready 12qt stockpot, and looked for a while before settling on this one.  I own a full set of Calphalon Contemporary stainless cookware, and use that as my gauge for medium to high quality cookware.\n\nThis MultiClad Pro stockpot is of significantly heavier gauge.  Although it would be very difficult to measure, it appears that each layer (outside stainless, center aluminum, inside stainless) are all thicker than the equivalent layer in the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless.  The overall thickness is about 1mm thicker on the MultiClad Pro.  I've used AllClad, and can see absolutely no advantage to it over the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro.  If the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro series of cookware had glass lids, I would have gone with them, but my wife was very set on glass lids, so we went with the Calphalon - which is fine.\n\nIt is absolutely induction compatible, so no worries there.  I highly recommend this pot in particular, and this line of cookware in general.  Really impressive for the price.;Outstanding stockpot
202;49.0;5.0;36.0;"I spent more hours than I want to admit researching and choosing pots and pans. I ordered several different sets including Cuisinart's Chef's Classic 7-piece set and the MultiClad Pro 7-piece set. I ended up returning both and purchased individual pots. If you purchase Multiclad pots individually, you don't end up paying too much more than a full set would cost, but you can choose the exact pans you want. I purchased a 10"" saute pan, 1.5qt sauce pan, and 4qt sauce pan and I use every pan almost every day. If I bought the 7- or 12-piece set, I'd save some money per pan, but many of the pans (8qt stockpot, for example) would sit idle.\n\nI really liked the idea of getting a saute pan because it holds way more food and is more versatile. I can cook for 2-5 people with the same pan, whereas the 10"" frying pan that comes with the 7-piece set can barely make enough for 3 people.\n\nIt cooks very evenly and like others have said, can be made non-stick with the right preparation. Simply warm up the pan first, then add oil, and once that is nice and hot, add your foods. I made the best crepes I've ever made in this pan with no sticking at all!\n\nThe look and feel of the pan is also excellent. It's heavy and high-quality, but not too heavy. Also, the brushed stailess exterior with the mirror-finish rim is so sexy, if a pan can be called sexy. I like these so much that I always want to clean them up and they make me happy every time I see them!\n\nGet this, it's highly recommended!

I did exactly what the chef says to do and WOW! perfection! Ide have to say the negative reviews that involves burning are most likely cases of trying to cook too hot and too fast.

181;52.0;5.0;34.0;"When I replaced all of my non-stick cookware last year, I wasn't sure I needed a stock pot. I use my slow cooker to make stock, and I ended up ordering a 5.5 qt Cuisinart Chef's Classic soup pot to take care of other things like making soup, boiling potatoes, etc. Pretty quickly, I kicked myself for buying the soup pot because the encapsulated base takes forever to heat, and the capacity was just slightly too small for most of the cooking I do with it.\n\nI finally broke down and ordered this a couple of weeks ago after eyeing it for months. I debated between the 8 and 12 qt sizes and decided to go with the smaller size. For our family of four, 6-7 quarts of anything is about the most I make at one time. I used to use my 6-qt non-stick stock pot pretty frequently, and I've found that the 5.5 qt soup pot is just slightly too small. Also, I just don't have the storage space for a 12-qt pot.\n\nI have been soooo impressed with the 1.5 qt saucepan I bought from the Multiclad Pro line that I was super excited to use this. Just like the saucepan, this stock pot heats up very quickly and evenly. The base is the perfect size for the largest burner on my stove, so I can use the rest of the stovetop to make other things at the same time. The first time I used it, I boiled corn on the cob. Just for comparison, the Chef's Classic soup pot routinely takes 45+ minutes for water to boil (with the lid on). This pot boiled in about 10 minutes. What a huge time savings!!! Yesterday I made a pot of applesauce. This pan easily held 16 large apples (next time I'm going to try 20+), and on a low setting on my stove, they cooked down in about an hour and a half and didn't stick to the pan at all.\n\nThe only thing I haven't liked so far is that I put the pan in the dishwasher and it came out a little spotty on the inside bottom surface. I usually don't put pans in the dishwasher, so it's not a big deal, but occasionally I do throw the stainless in if the dishwasher needs to be run but isn't super full. My saucepan in the same line has gone through the dishwasher a dozen times and comes through perfectly every time, so not sure why this one is different.\n\nAlso, be aware that the lid on this pan isn't glass; it's stainless steel. If you like to see what's going on in the pan without lifting the lid, then Calphalon makes a similar pot with a glass lid. Personally, I'm a lid-lifter, so I don't care. :)\n\nI am so glad I finally ordered this pan and so glad I got the smaller size. This is a perfect addition to my kitchen and will get lots of use as we head into applesauce and soup season. If I were to buy a matching set of cookware (wish I had known this a year ago...), I would buy everything in the Multiclad Pro line. It's that good. And, even though $100 is a lot to pay for one pot, for our family, that's only 2-3 meals in a restaurant, so as far as I'm concerned, it pays for itself pretty quickly.";Perfect!
130;53.0;1.0;28.0;"I did a lot of research on roasting pans before buying this one and it was really hard to decide, from the America's test kitchen favorite Caphalon to all clad and many more. I am completely dissatisfied with this product; I had to return it right away. When I got it the inside of the roasting pan had scratches like if you would clean it with a metal scrub, another imperfection is the end where the clad finishes it wasn't cut or polish properly, you can see part of the aluminum exposed because the outer stainless layer didn't cover it all the way. Also if you compare it with the Cuisinart multiclad pans the thickness of the roasting pan is not even half of the size as the pots and pans. Another problem is that the bottom is not flat at all, for induction owners this will be a huge problem, because it will be dancing in the stove and the heat wouldn't transfer to the roasting pan, defeating the purpose of its magnetic stainless steel finish. I didn't want to cook with it because of the pitting that occurred to a lot of reviews so I returned it.

54;56.0;5.0;18.0;I have a Bosch Induction stovetop with a FlexInduction (Bridge) burner, and I had been looking for a non-stick, induction compatible double burner griddle.

Four fried eggs and a package of breakfast sausage at the same time.  Easy.  This griddle heats fairly evenly.  I do need to let this preheat longer than I would a skillet so the temperature evens out.  I have had no issues with warping, and the non-stick coating does release food easily and clean up is a breeze.  Thank you Cuisinart for making a product that induction lovers have been waiting for.;Perfect! Six pancakes at a time
55;57.0;5.0;18.0;I absolutely LOVE these pots and pans! They are beautiful in appearance, have some weight to them but not too much, and are made extremely well. The handles to the pans are so comfortable unlike many pans I've used before. Some of the negative comments refer to sticking which is not what I have experienced. All you have to do is season the pans and you won't have any problems at all! Heat the pan up on the burner, then add some oil (I used coconut oil) and let that heat up just until it smokes a little. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool completely. Then just wipe out oil with a paper towel or cloth. There. That's it. Seasoned for nonstick! If you find that it begins to stick at some point, just do this again. It's not much different than cast iron (which I LOVE)! Worth the effort! Also, you have to heat the pans up and then add oil to cook the food! Another complaint is pitting. This is probably caused by adding salt to water BEFORE the water heats up! Can't do this with stainless steel! Little adjustments will make these pans last a long time! This set is very comparable to much more expensive pans! I did order a 1 qt. pan in the regular Cuisinart stainless steel line because I use that size a lot. Other than this, the set is perfect. All the pots and pans are the sizes that I use frequently. Don't hesitate. Just buy it!;Love These Pans
218;58.0;4.0;35.0;I have owned three different nonstick skillets from Cuisinart over the last 10 years. I have replaced each one after the coating began to decompose from wear and tear. Please note that my first two skillets lasted for what I consider a reasonable and appropriate useful life. I was very happy with both of them. I recently received my third and latest version of this pan. The coating seems excellent and cooking with it is easy and cleanup is a breeze. I am deducting one star in this review because the quality of the handles has decreased from my previous purchases. The handle is now shorter and flimsier. I don't think it will break but it does not afford as solid a grip as the previous handle. The square accessory handle is also now a lighter gauge metal and the finish work on both handles seems of a lesser quality. I would still recommend this pan. It is a good value. Most of my cookware is all-clad or Le Creuset but I can't justify spending the requisite price for all-clad in non-stick when inevitably the coating degenerates. I don't think anyone would be unhappy with this skillet but also wanted to note my concerns with the latest construction.;Not as Good as They Used to Be
59;59.0;5.0;18.0;"My husband and I are in the process of slowly upgrading most of our kitchen essentials. Our previous ""set"" of cookware was composed of random items either handed down to us from our moms or random pieces we had picked up over the years, but nothing was of very good quality. I've been comparison shopping for months to see what's out there that will work for us and get us a good bang for our buck. This is a very nice set of cookware! The pans have a good weight to them and my husband was very happy at how sturdy they are. We're both ecstatic that these can be used in the oven as well as on the stove top. All of the lids are metal, no glass or plastic anywhere in this set.\n\nI received my cookware set 2 days ago and last night was the first night that I used one of the skillets. After unpacking the box, verifying that all items were included/undamaged and washing/drying all of the pieces, I used the 10"" skillet to pan-fry some leftover meatloaf for a sandwich. The care instructions very clearly state that this cookware is not to be used on high heat, so I set my (gas) stove to just under medium-low. The pan got hot quickly and evenly, and my food came out perfectly! I had no issues at all with food sticking to the pan but I did use a little oil to help prevent sticking. My husband wanted to top his sandwich with a fried egg so he reused the pan for that, no issues at all.\n\nCleanup was a breeze, I just followed the manufacturer's instructions to fill with hot water, let cool to lukewarm and then I used a JetzScrubz Magic Scrubber Sponge (round) to remove any remaining foods/oil. Hand dried immediately after washing. I also bought some Bar Keeper's Friend powder to assist in keeping everything shiny in the future. I already wash all dishes by hand so I'm not concerned with how well they handle going through a dishwasher.\n\nThe lid that fits the stockpot also fits both the 10"" skillet & the 3.5qt saute pan.

I called Cuisinart and if I pay the shipping to NJ from CA, they will evaluate the pan and ship me a replacement - I hope.  Unlike someone else who evaluated this, I do not have to include a $7 check as I live in CA.

168;64.0;5.0;29.0;"This is the third one I bought, don't take it wrong,it hasn't broken or something, on the contrary, it's the best pot I've ever used: after I received my first one, I found it is really neat, so I bought a second one as a friend's housewarming gift, then, my mom came from oversea to visit us, she showed the madness loving with this pot, here comes the third one.\nCooking is my major hobby, I own plenty of high end cookwares, like a 3 quart Le creuset doufeu, 4 quart Staub cocotte, All-clad frying pan, but this 3 quart stainless steel pot is the most frequent one I use.\nEvenly distributing the heat, you can use it to make roux; reasonable weight, makes it easily to lift with one hand(there is no way to achieve that with cast iron pot); you don't need mittens to grab the handle; the rim makes pouring neat, nothing would drip along the side,even if you cook creamy soup with it, you don't need to wipe a single drop on your stove top.\nAnd the craftsmanship is compatible with All-clad, the handle feels more comfortable to hold on than All-clad.\nI use it to cook pasta for family of 3, soup, or just poach egg, boil some milk for hot chocolate, deep fry small amount of food, any recipe related to wet cook could be accomplished by this pot.\nThe manufacturer improved the shape of the handle, which is fatter than the old version. It feels better than the old one.\nIf I have to think up a con of this pot, maybe the price: my first pot was purchased at 2009 on sale for about $30, and the last one cost me $57 at 2014, I can blame on inflation.";my favorite 3 quart pot
153;65.0;3.0;27.0;First let me say that the set looks well made.  It's very heavy, the handles are put on well.  I do like the longer handles, which don't get hot when you cook.  I used a lid on a saucepan and it did get slightly warm so I think if you are using lids for extended periods the handles would likely get hot.\n\nI am just starting my cooking journey with these pans.  I made pudding using a metal whisk, which I only used gently and it did scratch the pot, which rather upset me.  The pudding did come out nicely without sticking.  I would think you ought to be able to use a metal whisk and expect it wouldn't scratch.  There were absolutely no directions with the pots, no warning about this.\n\nTried fried potatoes in the frying pan.  I heated the pan a few minutes, then put in some oil and a little butter.  Bits of potato made a solid brown mass on the bottom of the pan pretty quickly and the potatoes never did brown or get crisp.  Very disappointing. The pan cleaned up pretty well, considering the mess stuck on it.\n\nI don't plan to put mine in the dishwasher as I think the soap for the machines is too harsh.  I did buy a can of the barkeepers friend as recommended by some viewers and it does a nice job.\n\nI really hope things go better with these pots.  It took me a long time to decide on them.  I got tired of replacing non stick pots frequently and hated the risk of the surface coming off.  I will update.  My advice right now to anyone switching from non stick to SS is realize that they do cook differently.  I haven't tried eggs yet, but the cooking instructor at CIA recommends you actually buy a non stick pan for eggs and use it only for eggs so I just assume eggs might be a problem sticking.\n\n***Update--after using these pots for 2 months, I can say that I like the saucepans just fine, they heat up nicely and quickly especially when boiling.  The frying pans I still don't like.  I have gone back to using non stick frying pans.  Really disappointed about that.  Tried to do French toast the other day and it was a horrible mess, they stuck to the pan. Pretty much everything does.  I've made homemade pudding in the saucepan with no problem, sauces, etc.  Never tried eggs in the frying pan since everything else stuck.;Not impressed so far
129;66.0;3.0;24.0;I am serious about my cooking, and wanted something that would heat evenly and quickly, work on an induction heater, and remain good looking. These pans do fine for the technical end, but they discolor and stain very easily. This particular saucepan became permanently discolored in the simple act of making rice. To date, I have found no way to recover the finish.;Works well, but disappoints from discoloration
136;67.0;1.0;24.0;"I received this skillet and other Cuisinart MultiClad Pro pans for Christmas.  The sauce pans (1-1/2 qt., 3 qt. and 4 qt.) are flawless, the cooking experience is great, just like America's Test Kitchen said, sadly, this skillet is a major disappointment. First use it started flat, I have a smooth top range and plan to upgrade soon to induction, by the time the pan had heated up to cooking temperature it was like a rocking horse.  I am the cook of the house, the wife can but doesn't, I've been cooking since I was about 10 years old (I'm now 61) and I know how to cook properly and care for my cookware so it's not a matter of negligence on my part.  I find myself in agreement with ATK now and will be replacing this skillet with the 12"" All Clad.  FYI, the bottom of this skillet warped to a 1/4"" out heating 1 teaspoon of olive oil to a shimmer!  Fortunately the sauce pans have been problem free after almost two weeks of constant use.  I was planning to purchase the 5-1/2 qt. Saute pan, but after going over the reviews, I see this pans suffers the same defect.  Cuisinart really needs to correct this design flaw ASAP, cooks with smooth cook-tops are not going to be happy otherwise.";Unless you're cooking with gas, Buy the All Clad, NOT this!

17;69.0;5.0;10.0;No sticking. Easy Clean. Even cooking.\n\nPrevious stainless steel pans always required heavy scrubbing after soaking and all too often oven cleaner or carbon clean products.\n\nThis set has been easy to clean up, even if a pot was not stirred while forgetting dinner due to other demands or phone call. Soak in water, scoop out with a plastic spatula then 3M pad or just sponge or bristle brush to knock off loose soft foods before soap and water. The only different treatment than Analon set required is to use Bar Keepers Friend scouring powder if any mineral deposits are evident or just to polish the steel and towel dry is recommended to prevent air dry mineral spotting. I bought this set a year ago. I cook for seven adults every day for our care home for disabled adults.\n\nOmelettes are easy to cook in the small fry pan and pan flipping omelettes works well. To learn to flip eggs or omelette place toast in pan and flip until you reliably flip the toast and catch it. I flip over the sink just in case a little egg, butter or oil splats. After two or three omelettes I find I need to cool the pan, wipe it clean, and start with new oil before making more omelettes to prevent sticking. Fluffy omelettes need a tablespoon of milk for two eggs before scrambling. Add black pepper and Herbs of Provence to eggs before whipping with fork.\n\nHandles on fry pans remain cool when used stove top. Pot handles can require hot pads since they are smaller and close to the sides where heat climbs the outside of the pot. Handles remain tight.\n\nThe set looks brand new a year after purchase.\n\nDo I like this set? YES!;Easy Clean. Even cooking
246;70.0;5.0;31.0;This is a very well-crafted product that any chef would be proud to have in their home, but I will never know that joy because the handles stick out so far that it will not fit in my oven no matter which direction I put it in. Do be aware if you have a double oven or a small oven in your home that you will not be able to close the oven door with this in there. The description should make it clear exactly how far out the handles stick out (much farther than my other roasters) because that is VERY relevant.;BE CAREFUL: HANDLES MAKE IT OVER 18 INCHES
182;71.0;5.0;28.0;"This is the first addition to my 12-piece Multi-Clad Pro set. The set includes a 3 quart sautee pan, while the larger 5 1/2 quart version can be bought as a saute pan with long handle, or as a ""casserole"" with two helper handles and no long handle. The two pans are identical, other than the handles. At the 5 1/2 quart size, I prefer NO long handle: makes it hard to store in a cabinet (I don't hang pots on a rack) and gets in the way on the stove. Even more importantly, the long handle makes it difficult to finish a recipe in the oven. The long handle on the smaller 3 quart pan is not so bothersome, because the pan is smaller, but it makes the 5 1/2 quart pan quite cumbersome. I find I rarely if ever use the handle to move the pan around on top of the burner, so shorter, more compact handles are appreciated. The casserole is easier to store and easier to pop into the oven. Otherwise, fit and finish are the same as other pans in the Multiclad-Pro line.";great addition to the 12-piece Multiclad-Pro set
68;72.0;5.0;17.0;With the increase in induction cooktops, and a common feature of those cooktops being a bridge between a front and back burner, you'd think that it would be a little easier to find a double burner griddle that was induction friendly.  But alas, there are painfully few on the market.  Most that would otherwise be induction capable based on their material are really made for gas and don't lay flat on the surface - one side with ridges and one side flat but with a raised lip, make it not viable.  The ones that in theory could work (with just one cooking side and the other side flat like the lodge CRSGR18), mostly haven't worked well -- with very uneven heat distribution and warping.\n\nThis cuisinart one was a pleasant surprise.  It nicely spans 2 burners.  It distributes heat pretty evenly (not perfectly - pancakes for instance cook more quickly in some spots than others).  And it cleans well with its non-stick surface.  I use it primarily for breakfast foods - pancakes, french toast, etc, on an induction cooktop and it works very well.  I would prefer a little less of a lip so it would be easier to get a spatula under foods near the edges, but other than that ( and the slightly uneven temp distribution), this is a winner, and by far the best of its kind that I've found.;At least, a workable double burner griddle for induction!!

235;74.0;5.0;28.0;"I have an All-Clad 12"" fry pan, which I love. I neither love nor hate the handle (which polarizes people w.r.t. All-Clad), but regardless of your position in that debate, I can't imagine anyone who would say that the Cuisinart MCP-N handles are LESS comfortable than All-Clad. The pans have the same heft and feel as All-Clad, with the addition of better handles. The styling is so similar, in fact, that nobody would guess your All-Clad stuff didn't go with this set. The lids are great (another complaint people tend to have about All-Clad... few things come with lids), and each fry pan fits one of the lids included in the set (great for melting cheese on sandwiches/burgers, etc.). Any complaints about staining/sticking in the reviews are, in my opinion, from people who either don't know how to use stainless cookware (either during cooking or cleanup), or who have unrealistic expectations about a permanent, no-maintenance, lifetime shiny finish. You should buy this set if you intend to actually cook with it (and you will love it... it can take the abuse, and still looks and performs great); if you're just going to baby and polish it all the time, go for something WAY cheaper.";BEAUTIFUL! Just as good as, if not better than All-Clad.
23;75.0;5.0;11.0;I bought these for my wife, who is a world class cook (Not a chef! As she points out, chefs run commercial kitchens and are not always great cooks). She uses mostly Le Creuset cookware and some Calphalon non-stick for omelets and such. She wanted a good stainless steel skillet and I had decided on one I found at our local restaurant  supply for about $90. when I saw this set. It seemed like a heck of a good deal, so after doing some research I took the plunge. She is thrilled with the performance of these pots and pans! She indicated that the key is to properly season the pans and observe best practice when using them (moderate temperature, no dropping hot pans into cold water, and so on). These pans are ideal for creating a fond from the brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Note: these pans require no special treatment if you consider them to be what they are...tools for a working kitchen! Mostly she rinses them out with a scrubbie and hand dries them. They clean up well, although you will have water spots left, especially if you have hard water as we do. Worrying about the appearance of cookware is a fools errand. Kind of like worrying about the appearance of Snap-On wrenches or Stanley planes. In short, if you are a serious cook you can ignore reviews that whine over stains and discoloration. It is what it is. If it bugs you buy one set for show and one set for use.;Excellent!
191;76.0;3.0;26.0;I was torn when I made this purchase because I love All Clad.  I did some research and found this to be quality worthy of purchasing.  I needed two double boilers because I was making several kinds of chocolate truffles and coating them in chocolate, and did not want to spend the another $50ish on a second All Clad.  I tried using a metal bowl and it worked but it was a pain not having a handle.  So I decided that I would buy one All Clad and one Cuisinart double boilers ($35ish).\n\nPerhaps I missed this in the description or it wasn't listed, but this double boiler does not have a flat bottom - the bottom is rounded!  Honestly, this is illogical!!  A double boiler is typically for melting chocolate - the microwave is not the same when melting chocolate and you cannot make ganache in the microwave.  Point is, when the chocolate has melted, the double boiler is not only pulled off the flame it is also pulled off the pot of water it is nestled on or you chance scorching the chocolate or blooming the chocolate once it has cooled.  I was disappointed that I could not set this directly on the counter, I had to have an additional cold pot to set this in.  I was also inconvenienced by this.\n\nThis double boiler is a complete pain in the booty.  There are too may groves (to accommodate multiple size pots) and melting chocolate gets into these grooves no matter how careful you are.  This makes melting chocolate quite the chore and had me frustrated.  If that wasn't bad enough, cleaning all the chocolate filled grooves is painstaking.  Yes, you can soak the pot but you will still have to get a sponge in the grooves to wash all of the chocolate out.\n\nIt was not worth the money I saved verses purchasing a second All Clad double boiler because of all the inconveniences with this Cuisinart, the majority of the time, I opted to use the All Clad over this one.  Which was another inconvenience because the whole point of purchasing two double boilers with multiple truffles in the making was to obtain convenience.\n\nI would not recommend this double boiler for melting chocolate unless you do not mind all of the problems I mentioned.  However, although chances are mega slim I will ever melt chocolate in this double boiler, I will use it for cheese fondue (that needs to stay on the heat).;Eh, tried to save some cash. . .my All Clad is MUCH better!

I spent weeks doing research on pots and pans to replace a 20 year old Calphalon NS set which was on it's last leg. I narrowed down my options to AC of course, this set, and the Tramontina set from Walmart. I chose this one due to the overabundance of excellent reviews and the price point.  For the first test I sauteed onions and mushrooms, then cooked a chicken breast, and finally made a proper pan sauce. Don't tell anyone, but I actually licked the sauce from the plate it was so good. No other pan I've ever owned produced such a rich and delicious sauce. I did experience some sticking on the chicken but it was because I didn't dry the meat before placing in the pan. Lesson learned. Clean up was easy. I did experience a hazy residue in the pan after washing but I cleaned it up with some Bar Keeper's Friend and the residue completely disappeared. I am very happy with the Cuisinart set and highly recommend it to anyone in the market for new pots and pans.;Shiny Happy Cooking

Well, I think America's Test Kitchen must use gas for their tests, because these Cuisinart pans are TERRIBLE on a glass cooktop.  The first 12"" skillet warped immediately.

203;82.0;5.0;25.0;"Except for a 12"" fry pan for cooking bacon and omelettes, and a few cast iron skillets for making cornbread and caramelizing sugar, all my cookware is stainless.  I've owned Calphalon anodized aluminum, Cuisinart Chef's Classic, All-Clad, and Cuisinart Multiclad Pro. I also have a couple of pieces of high-end Cuivrinox (stainless steel-lined copper) I bought in Paris.  Multiclad Pro is hands-down the best cookware I've owned.  It's heavier than All-Clad, sticks less than Calphalon, is a thousand times more durable than non-stick, and is more manageable and requires less maintenance than the Cuivrinox (keeping copper polished is a pain). Cuisinart Chef's Classic has single layer stainless steel sidewalls and a bonded aluminum core bottom, so you don't get that heat-wrap thing going like overall triple-ply stainless.\n\nComparing Cuisinart Multi-Clad Pro just to All-Clad, the thickness of the pan walls - presumably the aluminum core - is much thicker than All-Clad, so you get great conductivity and heat retention. But individual pieces of All-Clad are more than twice as costly as Cuisinart Multi-Clad Pro.  What's more, Multi-Clad Pro has a nice pouring lip, so sauces and other liquids don't drip down the sides of the pan when you pour, as they do with All-Clad.  Both have close-fitting stainless lids, and are very easy to clean.  With a stainless interior, you also get those nice sticky brown bits when you saute, which add so much to the flavor of pan sauces.  You don't get that with nonstick pans at all.\n\nBottom line I'll take Cuisinart Multi-Clad Pro over any cookware you can throw at me.  It's durable, it's really beautiful, it's nice and heavy, easy to clean, and a much better value than All-Clad.  Frankly, it has no competition.";Terrific cookware - beats All-Clad hands down

47;84.0;5.0;12.0;"I bought the Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set and I absolutely LOVE these pans!!! I did a ton of research before EASILY deciding on this set. Amazon has the best price anywhere - Best value for excellent quality comparable to All-Clad, according to in-depth reviews/comparisons by people who have used both brands for years. Here are two if you google ""cuisinart multiclad pro review""\n1. centurylife.org\n2. thecookwareadvisor.com\n\nInitially, before researching, I thought I wanted the tri-ply encapsulated-base type with glass lids (cheaper) but multiclad construction with steel lids is the way to go for long term durability and performance. No glass to break, no seams to fail and even heat throughout. These pans are beautiful and substantial. And the lids are interchangeable! There is a lid to fit every pan, including the open skillets. Yay!!\n\nClean-up is easy with Barkeeper's Friend. (I found the best deal at Home Depot). I've had no problem at all with food sticking. Just be sure to heat the pan on med long enough for water drops to scatter like mercury beads, then add oil and swirl to coat pan before adding food. Then either shake the pan back and forth a little while adding meat, or just let it cook undisturbed for a minute or two and it will release naturally once a very slight crust had formed. Sufficiently heating the pan before adding oil is imperative. I remember ""hot pan, cold oil, food won't stick"" from watching The Frugal Gourmet many years ago. Also, a lot of recipes will require deglazing the pan after browning/cooking food. Just add water, stock, etc. and scrape up the fond (browned food residue) which will easily dissolve right away. Cooking with stainless steel is different than cooking with non-stick.

This fits in my pantry and on my stove much better, and has the same functionality. And it cleans up beautifully, since it can sit flat in my sink for a short soak (the long handled pan would have to sit on the counter for a soak).;Short handles are better

229;88.0;5.0;24.0;"I'm a fan of multiclad cookware, the kind that takes heat conductive aluminum and surrounds it with easy to maintain stainless steel. Professional cooks swear by it, but I'm just a home cook, and didn't even know about until a few years ago while watching America's Test Kitchen. This popular PBS series tests kitchenware, and reports their recommendations via their TV show, as well as 2 different magazines they publish. All-Clad cookware has always ranked up there as the best, but at a high price!\n\nFortunately for us middle class working stiffs, other cookware manufactures have picked up on the multiclad concept and have been producing their own versions.

234;89.0;5.0;24.0;I just switched from a set of non-stick that I really liked to Stainless Steel by Cuisinart.  Why?  Well, as I wrote in another review about getting a cast iron grilling pan, I began to wonder about the disappearing non-stick surface on the pan--was it going down the sink, or into my food and down my throat?  I began to suspect the latter.  So, I got the grill pan, but it isn't ideal for all situations.  Sometimes, you need a good sautee/fry pan, too.  So, I decided to get rid of all my non-stick cookware (which has to be replaced about every five to eight years anyway) and invest in something that was safe, and would last.\n\nA little research on the Internet made it evident that a good set of stainless steel is the way to go.  I read a couple of reviews that said Cuisinart MultiClad Pro Stainless was the best value for the buck.  Sure, you can spend more (a lot more) and get better pans, but I cook at home, not in a restaurant, and Amazon's discounted price made the Cuisinart pans irresistible.\n\nI read the reviews here before I bought, and I want to thank all of you for your insights, clean-up tips, and experiences.  I have found these pans are as good as advertised, and as easy to use as non-stick for the most part.  When using a skillet, let the pan warm up for a few minutes on medium heat.  Like any pan (with the exception of boiling water), you should almost never need to use anything higher than medium heat when cooking most anything--your food will cook faster, and your pans will not warp.  After the pan is warm, then add your cooking oil/butter etc., and let it heat up before adding food.  The result, a non-stick cooking surface.  However, I will say that Stainless is a little more work when it comes to clean-up, but not much.  Rinse and if necessary,  soak in warm soapy water to get most everything off the cooking surface.  There's usually a few spots here and there leftover inside the pan which a stainless steel cleaning powder will remove in a jiffy.  So, I'd say I invest about two extra minutes per pan to get them clean (excluding soak time, when needed).\n\nI'm looking for these to be the last set of cookware I ever buy.  I'm very pleased with this choice, and recommend them to anyone looking for a new or replacement set.;A Better Option vs. Non-stick

11;92.0;2.0;5.0;My pan lasted about 16 months and then the non-stick coating started peeling from the pan. The lifetime warranty on the pan is not what it appears to be because Cuisinart will not replace a plan where the coating is separating from the pan unless the pan is relatively new. Do not buy this pan for the lifetime warranty because you will pay to ship the pan to Cuisinart and then find out that the non-stick coating was compromised by customer misuse and you will be out the cost of shipping the pan to Cuisinart.;Warranty Problems

Cuisinart's packaging could be better - stuffing pots in pots in pots with only a slim amount of cardboard lead to rub marks on the insides of some of the pots.\n\nOne of the sauce pan's handle was really ugly - like ""wow, that looks like rust and grime"". I originally thought I was getting a returned set that someone left outside. I think this was just oil or packaging grease that wasn't cleaned off at the factory and a little bit  Dawn, some hot water, and elbow grease took it right off and looked like new.

The second pan looked exactly like the first. He photographed the pan and sent the photos to Cuisinart. A customer service rep responded that it qualified for replacement, and for a $7 charge, we could return it directly to them. Or, he said we could return it to Amazon for free. We will purchase another brand. If you look at the bottom of the pan, it appears the stamping of the logo raised the center of the pan. Very disappointing quality.

This is made from heavy stoneware and is easy to clean. The lid is made from glass, but the whole unit can be put inside the microwave. It holds the heat for a long time because of the thickness factor. No question Corningware is a generation ahead of the competition. Very happy with it\nUpdate:\nI've been using this Casserole for over two months, Cooking in Corningware compared to Plasticware saves money too and adds some quality in taste. Because the stoneware heats up and holds the heat a lot longer, I seem to use less microwave time that way. If in a Plasticware Casserole the cooking or heating time is 180 seconds, I only need a little over 90 seconds> Turn off the microwave and let the Corningware Casserole sit and wait. It cooked spaghetti and rice better. Heating leftovers in it is most definitely better.

148;101.0;2.0;16.0;"First the good things: heavy, thick-walled, nice handles, cooks stuff really well, cleans up easily, great price.\n\nI've returned three of these and kept one. Here's the history:\n\nNovember 2012, $85: The top of one side was dented badly enough that the top edge had a ripple. This did not occur in shipping--both the product box and shipping box were undamaged--so it probably left the factory that way. I sent it back for an exchange without making a close examination for additional flaws. I did notice, however, that the rack had a really nice smooth matte finish.\n\nDecember 2012: The replacement was a keeper (sort of). The bottom of the roaster is mostly flat, but liquid tends to pool a bit about the sides (unlike Cuisnart's Multiclad pots and pans which are completely flat on the bottom). The pooling is not consistent, so it's not clear if the pan is designed to have a channel or not. Either way, the manufacturing is sloppy. If you turn it over you can see that the bottom joins to the sides differently as you go around the pan. Some places there is a 90 curve between the bottom and the side. Other places it's more than 90 degrees so that a channel forms. Anyway, it works fine for cooking gravy on a gas stove top, but will not make contact everywhere on an electric glass top. There have been no issues with flaking or pitting. The rack is smooth matte, and welds are reasonably well finished. The rack handles are a bit crooked.\n\nJune 2014, $55: The date of manufacture was stamped on the bottom, causing a small bump up in the interior of the pan. The previous pans did not have date stamps, and Cuisinart Multiclad pots and pans are engraved rather than stamped. AS THEY SHOULD BE. What kind of moron damages a product by crudely stamping the date into it? The pooling was more pronounced. The rack had a cheap shiny look and rough surfaces throughout, and the welds were poorly finished. One of the rack handles was at an obvious angle. I called Cuisinart and asked if this was normal quality for this product (okay, dumb question). The rep asked where I bought the pan and then transferred me to Amazon customer service without another word. Shipped back to Amazon for an exchange.\n\nJune 2014: The replacement had a stamped manufacture date again, but the bottom was flatter, and the rack was acceptable quality (straight handles, smooth surfaces, okay welds). Now, however, there was something new: several small streaks of powdery black gunk stuck to the interior of the pan. Looked like something left over from the manufacturing process. Cleaned it up and decided the pan was good enough to keep. Using the patented Mark Bittman 45-minute-turkey method, I cooked a bird, and it turned out perfectly--well-browned all over, tender, moist, delicious--but when I cleaned up I noticed that a 1/4"" diameter piece of the stainless surface had flaked off. Never figured out where THAT went, but the pan went back to Amazon.\n\nAt this point I have given up on Cuisinart and am roasting stuff in cast iron pots and pans, although that won't work for turkey.\n\nAmazon was great on the returns--no arguments and no shipping charges.";Poor quality control, inconsistent manufacturing, flaking
4;102.0;5.0;23.0;Purchased this roasting pan because I thought it was about time after 40+ years without a good roasting pan.  Well, it is great. It cleaned really easy.  I washed the rack in the dishwaster-it came out clean. The pan cleaned up nicely (follow manufactors suggestion on cleaning after cooking).  The pan itself is still shiney.  This is a roasting pan my daughters-in-laws may fight over after I am gone. It would be a great wedding gift!;Heavy duty, perfect
110;103.0;1.0;14.0;I have used this pan over about three months now.  In that time I've used it about four times.  I haven't treated it like fine china, but I've been careful with it.  It has gone in and out of the oven and been soaked and scrubbed clean with a typical green scrubby sponge.  I have not piled pointy/scratchy metal things into it in the sink and I haven't banged it around.\n\nResult:  After four (maybe five) uses, there are significant scratches over the bottom of the pan.  The scratches aren't deep, but they went right through the metal coating and rust is showing through them.  On the top interior surface the stainless coating has begun to chip, showing the (aluminum?) core inside.  Just not acceptable.  I am going to try to get a refund from Cuisinart because I don't want to have to wait for a replacement from them only to have it fail in another few uses.  I have had good luck with other pans from Cuisinart, so this is a disappointment.  Particularly considering the poor quality of this pan is a known issue.\n\nEdit:  I tried contacting Cuisinart directly to get a refund or replacement.  They said they don't handle that, can't offer a refund or a replacement.

I noticed if I soak the pan right after using it, they seem to clean up much easier. I can't exactly hang TFAL pans from my pan rack, so I'm going to ride it out and try to learn how to use these pans.

Same for the lid, its obviously a cheaper lid, but looks very similar.\n\nIts well made with smooth rivet heads, a good unit for the price.\n\nI just ordered a second one.;Works Fine with 2 & 3 QT Cuisinart French Classic Saucepans
236;107.0;2.0;19.0;Updated 12/23/2012:  Within a week of first using it, rust has begun to develop on the outside (on the satin finish).  There was a very very small amount of water left on it after washing, and it's rusting badly at that spot.  To me, this indicates a very cheap steel.  NONE of my other pots rust, including older Multi-Clad Pro and All-Clad.  This is a bummer.\n\nOriginal review (5 stars):  I am amazed at the quality of the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Stainless. It may even be heavier than my All-Clad 3-ply. Plus the Cuisinart has the curved edge around the rim that All-Clad just started to include on their new products. It makes the pot stronger and also eliminates drips when pouring. The Cuisinart has a brushed stainless finish on the exterior that keeps it from getting scratched, unlike the All-Clad original.\n\nThe 12 quart stock pot does not have a disc on the bottom.  It's just three layers of metal on the bottom and all the way up the sides, much like my All-Clad D5 8 quart casserole.  The shape also is more like a casserole than my other stock pots that have high walls.  The Cuisinart walls are a little lower, and it's a little wider, which makes it perfect to hold a 4 pound chicken.  In my other stock pots, the chicken only would fit legs up, meaning it hit the sides during cooking.  The shape of the Cuisinart also makes it perfect for braising meats in the oven.\n\nI did not experience any hot spots using it on a gas range.\n\nThe lid is a little lighter than the All-Clad lids.  Both are single-ply stainless, with a handle.  The handles on the pots for both the Cuisinart and my All-Clad have rivets, meaning the rivets are visible on the inside of the pot, instead of being tack-welded.  I know this bothers some people, but I've never had a problem cleaning either pot.  I found the handles for the Cuisinart more comfortable than on my All-Clad pots, because the Cuisinart handles bow out, allowing my hands to stay slightly further away from the pot (a few millimeters).  The All-Clad D5 handles bow in slightly towards the pot.\n\nI don't know the difference between the MCP66-28 (the older Cuisinart) and the MCP66-28N (this product), because I haven't used older Multiclad Stock pot.\n\nIf you don't mind paying 5x as much and you don't mind the heavier weight, the All-Clad D5 brushed stock pot is the clear winner.  However, the Cuisinart is every bit as good as the new All-Clad 3-ply and better than the original All-Clad, and it's 2 - 3x less money.  In my mind, this is the best deal around.;Update 12/23/2012:  It rusts
171;108.0;5.0;17.0;I'm new to the use of stainless steel cookware, but I certainly know my way around the kitchen. I was getting tired of buying new cookware every 3-4 years, because of the chipping. Did a little research and found that stainless steel was the best choice for me and my family. I also found that many people complained about how difficult cooking and caring for this type of cookware would be.\n\nI knew there had to be a way around this, since so many professional use stainless steel. With a little research, cooking and caring for this cookware is not THAT hard. The key is to cook at low temps.  If you should experience that white chalky staining, or rainbow discoloration after you've washed and dried your pot and pans, you might have hard water or too much calcium in your tap water. The first time that happen to me I was not happy, I thought my pan was ruined. Just wipe them out with a little apple cider vinegar, or do like I did and buy some Bar Keeper Friend cookware cleaner.

I do a lot of one-pot cooking in each of these pans, and have come to prefer this pan over the All Clad. This Cuisinart pan has higher sides, so food is much less likely to jump out when I'm stir frying or sauting things like chopped onions. The higher sides also allow me to make 2-3 servings of a braise, or even soup, all in one pot--a great convenience. The curled lip of the pan means dripless pouring to transfer leftovers to a container. I much prefer the two-handle design while cooking, and it packs in my kitchen box much easier than a long-handled skillet or saut pan. It also cleans up  easily, since the corners where the sides of the pan meet the base are quite rounded on the inside, making it easy to swish a soft scrubber around before popping it in the dishwasher.

117;111.0;5.0;14.0;Ive been scared of stainless steel cookware for years. I was so convinced that cleaning would be hard and food would be stuck everywhere so I had been using Teflon coated pans for the last twenty years. But if you have Teflon pans you know over time they can warp and the Teflon starts to peel off. My husband really wanted a set of nice looking pans (he is such a boy and what is better looking than stainless steel) so we started to research.\nI purchased the Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set and it is fantastic.  However the 8 skillet just isn't quite big enough for some of my cooking needs.  This 12 skillet is great as it matches the set I purchased and has exactly the same upkeep needs as my full set.\n\nWe decided to go with the Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro for a few reasons.\n\n1. It has the Tri-ply 18/10 stainless steel with the aluminum core.\n\nThis was important to us because we wanted something that would last forever. I don't want to have to buy pots and pans again and so Im willing to spend a little more money on a nice set instead of purchasing a new Teflon pan every 4-5 years.\n\nFrom everything we researched you want at least the 18/10 and three layers for heat distribution and even cooking.\n\n2. We couldn't beat the price for a set of this caliber and it was rated top for the price in two different magazines. I believe Better Home and Gardens was one of them the other was http://www.allcookwarefind.com/Stainless-Steel\n\nWe researched and this set was less money than the All Clad and Calphalon cookware with similar ratings and materials.\n\n3. Everything in the set could be placed in the oven.\n\nThis is a nice feature. The handles are sturdy and made of the same stainless steel. They can be put in the over up to 500 degrees. I never thought I needed this function until I started cooking roasts and chicken in iron skillets it is great to be able to cook everything in one pan.\n\n4. There were extra matching pieces available to add to our set later.\n\nNow I have almost everything I need and still have the option of adding a 5  quart sauce pan, dutch oven or a another pieces at a later date without breaking the bank.\n\nFYI:\n\nWe went through about a dozen different youtube videos and found a few useful tidbits if this is your first stainless steel set.\n\n- ALWAYS season the pan prior to the first use or after a heavy cleaning. This is easy enough and there are thousands of videos on how to do it. We preheated the pan and added coconut oil. Turn the heat up a little and let the oil heat until smoking. Pour off the excess and then gently wipe with a paper towel and let cool. If done correctly you can even cook eggs on your pan without any sticking.\n- ALWAYS preheat the pan before cooking. This will minimize the any sticking and will help the heat distribution.\n- NEVER wash with dish soap. This will remove any seasoning you have done to the pan. When you are done cooking let the pan cool (DO NOT PUT FROM STOVE DIRECTLY INTO WATER this may warp the pan) then with a spatula or wooden spoon run any excess material off the bottom. If there is any stubborn residue you can add a little warm water or oilheat until warm and then gently rub the material off.\n- GET Barkeepers Friend.

When I emptied it and started cleaning the inside I discovered much to my dismay that the handle rivets inside the pot were no longer the bright shiny silver as it was and is on the rest of the pots. Instead the rivets are corroded, course, and a pale gray color and now its making everything stick to them. Such a shame because they came in a quick delivery, no damage, and looked so beautiful. Looks doesn't cut it for me its quality of the product that I concern myself most with and this does not stand up to my expectations.;Thought these pans would be great based on the many positive reviews however this is ...
147;115.0;4.0;15.0;This cookware is overall an excellent set. They do take a minute to heat up, but they are rock solid performers in the kitchen. I used to be a chef and I have worked with some commercial cookware and this is just as solid and functional. They look wonderful but can pick up stains on occasion. Nothing to be concerned about however since I believe they can be carefully removed.\nMy chief complaint is about the cover or lids. They get darn hot. The loop handles on top of the lids absorb heat too quickly and the design of those is, from my perspective, flawed. The metal is flat and bent to the handle shape, which causes the lid to occasionally slip if you're carefully holding it. That slip causes the hot lid to fall, at least for me, on my wrist area. The handles for the lids should be more round in shape so with motion they won't be apt to slip and cause burns. This is a minor quibble, but one that I think would allow me to drop five stars overall if adjusted.\nJust as a reminder, read the directions on how to care for this cookware. Some reviewers do not appear to have done so and now have cookware that is not as good looking as it could be...but remains functional.;Good, solid choice.
214;116.0;1.0;18.0;I have been wanting some quality stainless steel cookware for a long time. Read all the positive reviews here, and decided this Cusinart set was the best value for the money. I purchased the set back in mid 2012. I do like some features such as the tapered edges, the weight, the look (when the set was new), and the even heating. But I mainly bought because I wanted quality stainless! Shortly after getting and using the set, I started noticing stains on the stainless steel. Since then they have gotten worse. The quality of the stainless steel used for these pots and pans is horrible. My old set of cheap, single thick stainless, with plastic handles, given to us at our wedding over 20 years ago, is better at not staining than this set. Every single piece of this cookware has stains on it, some worse than others. They look terrible hanging on the pot rack, and the stains will not scrub off. I thought spending close to $300 for the set, I would get better results. I can't afford to replace the set with more expensive stainless, so I guess it's back to the cheap stuff for me.;Very Disappointed
185;117.0;5.0;17.0;"MultiClad Pro pans are ""da bomb."" It really doesn't get much better.  Ok, I'll admit the handle rivets are a little hard to wash around sometimes, but I love the strong handles so I will put up with the rivets. Once thing I really love about these pans is the way the lid works with the pan to roll condensed steam back into the pan instead of it rolling down the side of the pan.";Pans Don't Get Any Better
166;118.0;1.0;16.0;"After a first use of 1.5Q pot, a layer of brushed shiny stainless steel peeled off in one place and revealed something black under it (looks like a tiny pitting -- shaped as a heart, approx. size of 1/16 inch), and there are many strange rainbow color spots/stains -- bigger than a ""black pitting"" (also looks that a tiny part of a top layer of stainless steel might be ""disappearing/peeling off"" and those spots/stains cannot be washed/cleaned -- looks like a first sign of pitting). I used the pot the second time to reheat the soup, and after cleaning the pot, I counted 1 deep and 40 ""less"" deep pitting but ugly looking stains (for now). After a first use of 3Q pot for cooking pasta, there were stains and around the top inner side some black ""ring"" was created --  again looks that the tin layer of a brushed stainless steel probably disappeared and there is no way to clean it off to get a clean brushed stainless steel look back. Even some lids do not a have nice clean brushed stainless steel look, but they have a ""blackish"" look. Maybe, they brushed the stainless steel so much on bottom of lids and some pots around the inner top that there is left only an extra tin layer of stainless steel and it shows what's underneath. Who knows?\n\nThis cookware seems to be made of very inferior quality, if after one use of a pot (after one cooking of rice for 20 minutes) something like that happens. Even if Cuisinart claims it is 18/10 stainless steel, probably the plant in China used for the production of these pots/pans used some cheap knock off version of 18/10 stainless steel. Probably that's why there is NO ANY MENTIONING of 18/10 stainless steel on the retail box for this set, and NONE OF POTS/PANS IS STAMPED as 18/10 stainless steel on the bottom -- just ""stainless steel"". Be aware that there is NO MENTIONING about a 18/10 stainless steel being used in this set on the Cuisinart website -- 18/10 stainless steel specifications appear only at Amazon or Newegg websites. The Cuisinart states: ""stainless steel for professional use"" on its website. What does it mean?\n\nIt is hard to believe that the pots are stained/pitted/blackened after one use -- mostly to boil water for pasta, cook rice, or to heat soup!!! They even scratch easily inside when using bamboo utensils.\n\nIf a pot looks ugly with stains/pitting that increase in amount after each cooking, and it cannot be cleaned with a water and detergent, what could I expect in a long run?\n\nNote: The quality of this set is HORRIBLE and except Amazon claiming that it is 18/10 stainless steel, there is no any confirmation of it on the Cuisinart website, a retail box or pots/pans. We have Tramontina cookware pieces for almost 8 years, with a stamped 18/10 stainless steel on the bottom of pots, and they were used many times. I never saw any peeling off of the top layer or black ""rings"" around the top -- similar to what I observed in Cusinart 1.5Q or 3Q Multiclad pots (only 2 pots I used from this set until now, because I already hate idea of ""testing"" the remaining pots). We also have a Kitchen Aid pot, with a stamped 18/10 stainless steel on the bottom of pot, and we use it the exactly same way as these Cuisinart pots (cooking rice, pasta, re-heating soup), and I never experienced pitting in years and large amount of stains after first couple uses. There is something really questionable about the quality of this set.\n\nI would post the picture of 1.5Q and 3.0Q pots with all pitting/stains, if I know how to do it.";Stains and pitting after a first use
38;119.0;1.0;8.0;After returning our original pan due to the bottom not being flat Amazon quickly sent out a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement has a warped base too and will have to be returned. I'm not sure if this is a defect or how the pan should be. I need a flat bottom roaster for gravies and deglazing. Since this has a warped base it causes pooling in the corners. Most people in the question and answers say it should be flat so I don't think it should warped. If it was flat then I'm sure it would be a good pan;Not a flat base
24;120.0;4.0;7.0;"This is my first ""real"" cookware set, and one that I am expecting will last me for *many* years. This is an upgrade from a non-stick aluminum set that I had previously. That set worked well enough, but after a number of years the coating was coming off and dents were starting to pile up.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the Multiclad Pro set is that the pots are beautiful. They have really excellent design that I find myself admiring every time I use them. The next thing I noticed is that they are much heavier than their aluminum equivalents, though not unwieldy. They have a nice, solid heft that gives the impression they will resist daily use and the occasional knock very well.\n\nLeaving behind the Teflon coating, I was a little concerned that food would stick more and that the pots would be harder to clean. Neither one has been a problem. The evenness of the heating has kept me from burning anything significantly, and the smooth surface doesn't appear to give food a chance to stick. The only  issue I've had with cleaning has been some discoloration that stays behind after cooking starches like rice or pasta. I cleaned that off by letting it soak with a mixture of water and white vinegar, and then it came off pretty easily.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is that the 8-quart stock pot came with a bit of layer separation along one edge. It was fairly subtle, and I didn't notice it for a few weeks, but Amazon replaced it quickly. The replacement was flawless, and no further issues have come up. Since it was only one piece of the set, and the replacement was fine, this suggests to me that the separation issue isn't that common. Still, when you get a new set you would do well to inspect the edges to ensure that there is no separation between the layers. If there is, get a replacement within the return window.\n\nThe last thing to think about with this set is which pots you actually need. As a single person, I don't use the 3.5 quart saut&eacute; pan, and I use a cast iron frying pan instead of the excellent frying pans that come with this set. I did get an extra 2 quart saucepan (from the same Multiclad Pro collection), though, because I find the 3 quart pan to be too large for some of my common uses. And since I intend to be using these for many years to come, I expect I will grow into using the remaining pieces as well.\n\nOver all, a great cooking set!";Hopefully a lifelong cooking set!
41;121.0;3.0;8.0;Some of the other reviews compared this set to All Clad.  I have owned a few All Clad pieces before and there is no comparison.  This is not even close to All Clad in quality or durability.  Ever so disappointed.  To say that clean up is a bear is an understatement.  These pans are no different than the pans your grandmother used back in the 1970s where  you had to soak them to get them clean.  Think I'm kidding? If you read the directions for care that come with the set, they states that you need to soak them with warm soapy water immediately after use.  As another reviewer noted... truly NOT a non stick pan.  And worst of all, they scratch so very easily.  I made mashed potatoes and I was gentle and careful with the masher -- no, I did not use an electric mixer in the pan.  Yup, you guessed it, the pan is now scratched.  I suppose I should not be surprised given the price point on these pans.  I just wish I had known what little durability they had before I purchased them.;Hard to clean, easy to scratch

Truly unbelieveable.  Now returning the third pan.  They also say that Cuisinart does not do refunds.;pits inside pan after one use
44;123.0;1.0;8.0;I am so disappointed with these pots/pans.  I originally wanted All-Clad, but didn't want to pay the high price.  These had great reviews, plus I've always liked the Cuisinart brand, so I thought this would be a good purchase.  When I purchased them (December 2015), the description said ALL pieces were dishwasher safe.  However, I now see that it has changed to say only the lids are dishwasher safe.  If I had known this, I would have never purchased them, as I prefer to put them through the dishwasher about 50% of the time.  The #1 reason I was looking to buy new pots/pans was because our old Belgique set also had the same layering, with the aluminum core exposed on the outer edge.  They had it on the bottom, these have it on the top.  That means that when they go through the dishwasher, the detergent eats away at the aluminum and quite quickly it is worn down enough that the stainless layers become sharp and can cut you if you hit is just right.  I absolutely hate these pots/pans now and would not recommend them.  I am now on the hunt for All-Clad and after this experience, I am more willing to pay the higher price.;I was mislead:  description originally said they were ALL dishwasher safe - now changed to just lids.
25;124.0;5.0;7.0;"Finally, after cooking for my family for over 50 years, I now have a set of beautiful, shiny cookware that ""Santa"" gave me for Christmas 2016!  I have always wanted a good set of cookware, but it was just so expensive I didn't want to spend my hard-earned money on such an extravagance.  So, when my hubby asked me what I wanted for a Christmas gift, I told him a set of nice pots and pans. At first, he thought I was joking...but since he always appreciates my cooking, it finally occurred to him that he might be the benefactor of a gift such as this. :o) I asked my daughter (who is in the restaurant business) whether she would go with pre-clad or stainless, and she recommended the stainless. Then, my husband did some on-line research and found this set that was drastically reduced (from $>600 to around $200) on Amazon...and, lo and behold, it was under our Christmas tree! The stainless steel (vs. the Teflon cookware I've been using for ages!) takes a bit of getting used to (I went on-line for some cooking pointers and care suggestions) and they are a tad more work to clean, but they're so worth it!  The way the food turns out is just great.  And I now show off my new pots and pans to family and friends when they come over! (Of course, they think I'm nuts, but who cares?!)";Cooking with a Smile!
93;125.0;5.0;11.0;I bought this because I like to long-simmer some soups and stews and sauces. The 4 qt. size is a bit larger than I wanted, but I'm happy for that because it is never even close to boiling over at low temps and I have room enough to drop in ingredients without splashing the stove top. It is almost too pretty to use, but once I did, I loved the way it heated evenly, cooked predictably and let me use my favorite utensils without worry of damaging the pot. The straight sides and perfect lip make stirring and pouring go as planned. I do use a flame tamer (by Nordicware) because the gas flame can be less than perfect.\n\nI just bought the smaller 1.5 qt. size for everyday use and I love it too. If you enjoy cooking, this is the heavyweight type of pan you've been looking for that cooks almost as well as cast iron (sorry, but nothing does quite as well as cast iron) and is as easy to clean as those cheap pans you throw out after a year or so. These will be around for the next generation at least. True professional quality makes me think it was designed by people who actually use them for cooking. The aluminum core brings even heating to stainless steel with a mirror finish. I just love this line of cookware from Cuisinart!;The Perfect Cookware!
26;126.0;1.0;7.0;I gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed in this try. I got it for X-Mas and specifically requested this one. There were cheaper ones, but I decided to go for a little more expensive one because I have always trusted Cuisinart. However, I have used this twice, and both times, left permanent burn marks on the surface during the searing process on the stove. Roasting trays are supposed to last a very, very long time, and at this rate, I don't see this lasting more than a couple years. Needless to say, the next roasting try won't be from Cuisinart.;I'm pretty disappointed in this try

63;128.0;4.0;9.0;We decided to purchase this set to replace our flaking non-stick Revere set we received as a wedding present almost 15 years ago.  The box was well-packed and nothing was broken.  Everything we received looked fine.  The instructions were in English and everything was straight forward for anyone with an average IQ.\nAppearance:  The interior of the pots gleam, but the exterior is not highly polished.  This was not a problem for us as we read some reviews and knew what to expect.  The pots are attractive, but they do not gleam like high-end All-clad pots.  We have ours hung up on a rack with the interior facing where people can see and the back of the pans against the wall.\nWeight and Balance:  If you are used to aluminum pans, these will feel a bit heavy.  The ergonomics of the handle are above average, which gives the pots a nice feel in your hands.  The large stock pot can get pretty heavy, especially when filled.\nSet composition and construction:  Everything but the steamer insert is very well constructed.  You may not like the rivets that stick out when it comes to food, but those are what make the pans so substantial.  The steamer insert is fine, but it is clearly made of lesser quality than the other pieces.  The lids all fit tightly and I am amazed at how little they let out.  I actually have to adjust for some recipes to allow for more venting to get a good reduction while using less cooking gas.  The big cook pan and stock pots get the most use.  They are fantastic.  We use the frying pans, but with our growing family, they are usually used to cook accompaniments to dishes instead of a main dish.  I kind of wish the steamer fit the large stock pot, but I knew what I was getting.  From a pots and pans perspective, I think the only other things we use regularly not included with the set are a wok (which stainless steel is NOT ideal), dutch oven, cast iron skillet, cookie sheet, pizza pan, and a good decent quality disposable non-stick 12 inch frying pan.  No real complaints here.\nCooking performance:  We are coming off of using mostly non-stick pans and a cast iron pan.  Searing performance was better than an aluminum non-stick pan, but inferior to cast iron.  Hubby says All-Clad sear better, but they seem to do a good job if you do not need an intense sear.  They are good for 85% of the cooking we do since we do not eat a lot of red meat.\nLearning curve:  If you are used to using non-stick pans, there is a learning curve to using these pans.  We are not chefs and no one would mistake us for gourmets, although one of us is a pretty good cook.  Anyhow, the biggest thing is getting used to heat adjustment.  Of course, you need preheat your pan.  You also need to be familiar with how hot the setting is for your range.  Most midrange ranges have a power burner.  I would say use extra caution on these.  Having a thermometer helps, but we find ourselves forgetting to use them.  Therefore, we wind up getting burned on stuff or vaporized oil every once in a while.  What can I say?  We are not chefs.  After a few months, we pretty much use heavy searing like steaks, roasts, and burgers for cast iron.  We will typically sear chicken or seafood in the these pots.  We have been able to cook eggs.  I get everything stuck and husband seems to be able to not make a mess.  He told me that I either need to turn down the heat if I cook with butter or extra virgin olive oil or change my timing.  Frankly, I think it is easier to stick with a non-stick pan for things like eggs, flaky fish, and other pain in the rear items.  We will just buy a cheapo set and replace once a year instead of using our non-stick pans until they flake.  Other things I had to learn was not to immerse hot pans in water, how to determine heat of the pan, how to preheat a pan properly, how much is too much heat, how to set my temperature correctly, and smoke points of oils we use.  It may sound like a lot, but it is pretty much like learning how to not be a bad cook.\nCleaning:  For pots and pans, a good soak with a small touch of soap seems to work wonders.  That includes things like stuck on rice, day old mac and cheese, and various other messes.  For hardcore messes like burned on oil residue or scorched food, Barkeepers Friend and a non-aggressive scotch brite pad works well.  A small sprinkle, a little water, and some patient light scrubbing is all it takes to return everything back to like new condition.  I use soap and water after Barkeepers Friend to prevent any possible residue poisoning.  We do usually put our pans in the dishwasher.  They do get water spots (we do not use a rinse aid) if we do.  Every few washes, we wash them by hand to return them to like new appearance.\nDurability:  These should hold up for life assuming they are not abused.  If they get scuzzy, just polish them up.\nValue:  Two bills seem to be the price to pay for low end on these, although we paid a bit more on Amazon.  You essentially get 8.75/10 of the cooking performance of an All-clad set with half the looks.  This is a pretty complete, high quality set.\nCons:  They are not non-stick crappy pans so there is a learning curve.  To look and perform the best, they should be washed by hand.  You cannot just throw them hot into cold water.  They will get scuzzy if you wash them only in the dishwasher.  You cannot cook an egg without some sort of lubricant like oil or water without them sticking.  Other stick foods like sticky rice and pancakes also require adequate amounts of oil or butter.  The pans say the are made in China despite what Amazon has on their site.  These do not replace all pans.  The rivets on the pan can trap food and be annoying to clean since they are not ground flush.\nPros:  You get a high quality set of pans.  You get an almost complete set of pans that distribute heat evenly and cook beautifully.  You get to escape the potential poisons that come with non-stick pans while learning to become a better cook.  You can get these pans cleaner than a non-stick pan.  You get almost everything you need to cook diverse and healthy meals for your family.;Great set of cookware.
27;129.0;5.0;7.0;"The 12 piece MultiClad Pro set MCP-12N, sold elsewhere on this site, is by far the better value per piece and includes the 1 1/2QT and 3QT saucepans sold individually here.  But I often need to use two 1 1/2QT saucepans at the same time, and I wanted to evaluate product performance before investing in the larger set, so I started with this individual one.\n\nI'm no longer comfortable using my old non-stick anodized aluminum pots and pans, for health reasons. If you're reading this, you likely have the same concerns and already decided on stainless steel, are wondering whether to get this one or another brand.\n\nGet this one.\n\nThe top two brands are All Clad and Cuisinart, all others fall short in one way or another. All Clad are made in the USA, and you pay for that. Cuisinart are made in China, but this is one example where the product is of comparable quality. It really comes down to whether or not you think the Made in USA aspect is worth up to twice the price.\n\nBelow are some comments meant to apply to the MultiClad Pro line in general as well as this individual saucepan.  But for this saucepan specifically, in the 1 1/2QT size I found it to be wider and shallower than my old non-stick.  This was a plus, because it created a larger surface area on the bottom - on my gas range it was difficult with the old one keeping flames from going up the sides even on the smallest burner, but that hasn't been a problem with this one.  The first time I used it, for some broth-based soup, I had some vaguely ""rainbow"" discolored stains on the bottom.  These are hard water stains and they disappeared instantly after applying a little white vinegar.  Subsequent uses and cleanings have been easy with no residue requiring extra steps.\n\nIn general:\n\nConstruction - these have three layers running throughout the cookware, both bottom and sides (many other brands are only layered on the bottom). Inner layer / cooking surface is 18/10 (aka 304 grade) stainless steel, the gold standard for stainless steel kitchenware (316 grade is more corrosion resistant but there's no advantage in the kitchen, only marine environments). Middle layer is aluminum for heat conductivity (SS by itself is a poor conductor). Outer layer is 18/0 stainless steel, which is magnetic for induction stove compatibility. The middle aluminum layer is completely encapsulated and does not come in contact with food. Handle is cast SS and of a design that stays cool while in use. Lid is all SS. Overall slightly more hefty than non-stick ano aluminum but much lighter than modern cast iron (and cast iron is a poor choice for saucepans anyway).\n\nCooking - the aluminum core distributes heat quickly and evenly. You really can effectively cook using a lower heat setting than you would with non-stick ano aluminum. Stainless steel is NOT non-stick, doesn't matter which brand, but that's more relevant with skillets than saucepans.\n\nCleaning - it comes with a cleaning guide, which states that after you finish cooking with it, fill it with hot water, add some dishsoap, then let it cool to room temperature while you do your other dishes. This has been surprisingly effective, with a quick scrub using a blue non-scratch scrubbing sponge being sufficient to finish the job.  Really, with this saucepan specifically, I usually don't even have to do that much, just wash it normally like any other pot. If you get some discoloration on the cooking surface, that's likely hard water stains which are easily and quickly removed with a little white vinegar, also as stated in the included cleaning guide. Anything else you can't get off can be removed using Bar Keeper's Friend (a widely available cleaning product), but you typically won't need to use that unless you're just burning everything to carbon all the time. It's also dishwasher safe though that will create more wear over time. Overall, not a challenge to clean if you follow the instructions.\n\nRecommended.";Great saucepan

However, the second pan all arrived scratched, this time with the side of the inside surface being scratched.  I have not used the pan at all, so my review is based on the fact that it seems pretty easy to scratch it, since shipping it seems to have resulted in scratching.  I would guess that actual use would result in a lot more scratching.  I am trying another brand now.;Pan arrived scratched -- twice

The Cuisinart customer service rep, made me feel like I was losing my mind, even though I had the box and pan on the table in front of me! I spoke with a person at the online shop just seeking confirmation that the pan did indeed exist and that the numbers I had were for a legitimate item. They assured me I was not losing my mind, so I placed a second call to customer service. After being transferred around a bit and sitting on hold, I finally spoke with a different representative who said, yes, they make this pan and would I please email pictures so they could review the claim to see if I qualified for a replacement pan.  I took pictures and Cuisinart sent me a new pan.\n\nUpon opening the SECOND box, I inspected the pan and found the SAME issue! Quality control is sadly lacking! You would have thought that someone would have opened the box to make sure the replacement pan did not have the same issue!

I have now used the pot numerous times, and the spots nor discoloration have returned.;Mine had those spots with surrounding discoloration that look like something came off after one use
131;137.0;5.0;12.0;Ive been scared of stainless steel cookware for years.  I was so convinced that cleaning would be hard and food would be stuck everywhere so I had been using Teflon coated pans for the last twenty years.  But if you have Teflon pans you know over time they can warp and the Teflon starts to peel off.  My husband really wanted a set of nice looking pans (he is such a boy and what is better looking than stainless steel) so we started to research.\n\nWe decided to go with the Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro for a few reasons.\n\n1.  It has the Tri-ply 18/10 stainless steel with the aluminum core.\n\nThis was important to us because we wanted something that would last forever.  I don't want to have to buy pots and pans again and so Im willing to spend a little more money on a nice set instead of purchasing a new Teflon pan every 4-5 years.\n\nFrom everything we researched you want at least the 18/10 and three layers for heat distribution and even cooking.\n\n2. We couldn't beat the price for a set of this caliber and it was rated top for the price in two different magazines. I believe Better Home and Gardens was one of them the other was http://www.allcookwarefind.com/Stainless-Steel\n\nWe researched and this set was less money than the All Clad and Calphalon cookware with similar ratings and materials.\n\n3. Everything in the set could be placed in the oven.\n\nThis is a nice feature.  The handles are sturdy and made of the same stainless steel.  They can be put in the over up to 500 degrees.  I never thought I needed this function until I started cooking roasts and chicken in iron skillets it is great to be able to cook everything in one pan.\n\n4. There were extra matching pieces available to add to our set later.\n\nThis set has almost everything we needed.  But I like the option of adding a 5  quart sauce pan, dutch oven or a 12 inch skillet at a later date without breaking the bank.\n\nFYI:\n\nWe went through about a dozen different youtube videos and found a few useful tidbits if this is your first stainless steel set.\n\n- ALWAYS season the pan prior to the first use or after a heavy cleaning.  This is easy enough and there are thousands of videos on how to do it.  We preheated the pan and added coconut oil.  Turn the heat up a little and let the oil heat until smoking.  Pour off the excess and then gently wipe with a paper towel and let cool.  If done correctly you can even cook eggs on your pan without any sticking.\n- ALWAYS preheat the pan before cooking.  This will minimize the any sticking and will help the heat distribution.\n- NEVER wash with dish soap.  This will remove any seasoning you have done to the pan.  When you are done cooking let the pan cool (DO NOT PUT FROM STOVE DIRECTLY INTO WATER this may warp the pan) then with a spatula or wooden spoon run any excess  material off the bottom.  If there is any stubborn residue you can add a little warm water or oilheat until warm and then gently rub the material off.\n- GET Barkeepers Friend.  This is a great way to restore your stainless steel to looking brand new.\n\nFor the price we didn't find a better set.;Great Long Lasting Set for the Price.
179;138.0;3.0;14.0;I purchased two 8-in and one 10-in, the bottoms of all three pans are not flat, but rather concave up about 3/32 - in.  On a ceramic top stove this results in uneven heating.  While others have complained that the construction of the handle is flimsy having been changed from what  was previously used, I don't agree.  The shape has been changed somewhat, but it is still quite substantial and good looking.\n\nUPDATE 21 January 2014:  The non-stick coating on one of the 8-in pans has started to peel off in a continuous sheet.  This is not the usual nick or scratch one would expect, but rather the coating has become un-bonded from the base metal over an area of about 4-in by 2-in.  If possible I will upload pictures of the defect.\n\nWith regard to the concave up bottoms, I find that uneven heating (on my ceramic cook top) is not a significant issue.  The non-flatness, however, is an annoyance when sauting because the oil runs to edges leaving the center dry.\n\nUPDATE 8 April 2014:  Within a few weeks of my 21 Jan. update, the second pan's non-stick coating also began to peel off.  In California, warranty returns can be made to any of the product's retail dealers, but I could not find a Cuisinart dealer in my area that stocked these pans, and none of them would offer a refund. I contacted Cuisinart and they said to ship them the pans, along with $7.00 each, for their inspection and if they deemed the pans to be defective, they would be replaced.  Since both pans failed in the same mode and after such a short period of use, I decided to not throw good money after bad.  I threw them in the garbage.;Non-stick coating peeled off--Orig: Bottom not flat
43;139.0;4.0;7.0;Very nice set. A little heavy, but you should expect that with multiclad anyway since it's 3 layers/thicker. Discolors a bit with use, but that doesn't affect the performance. I didn't expect it to discolor as much though.;Overall great set!
141;140.0;1.0;12.0;This pan was delivered 5 weeks ago and after using it FOUR times to reheat soup and heat water, a small portion of the finish flaked off (bottom, inside).  I called Cuisinart.  The response was that they were sorry.  If I wanted to ship the very heavy pan back to them at my expense, they would refinish it.  So much for a LIFETIME warranty.;It should be of better quality and last longer than 5 weeks
245;141.0;5.0;15.0;For those of us who like steaming fish and veggies, this is a must- have kitchen accessory. It is ridged so that it fits over all sizes of Cuisinart pots. However, it is designed for only cuisinart multiclad cookware, so beware of that when purchasing.;Both pretty and practical.
165;142.0;2.0;13.0;The bolts inside pot shouldn't ever rust in a stainless pot, so why did these?  After searching for a long time for a well made and reasonably priced stainless stock pot, I bought this one for soups, stocks, and pasta, so lots of hot/boiling water.  It looks beautiful, but if bolts rust into contents after only 3 uses, it's not for me.;Rusted handle bolts inside pot after 3 uses!
85;143.0;2.0;9.0;"Very disappointed in the quality. I love Cuisinart products however; when this arrived it had several pit marks in the bottom of the pan. I should have listened to the other reviewers. I sent it back right away.";Too many pit marks
201;144.0;5.0;14.0;I received this roaster just in time for Thanksgiving.  It is sturdy, heavy and held an 18 pound turkey with a little room to spare.  The night before, my sister and I made the stuffing in it on the stovetop (we make a lot).  The bottom is perfectly flat so it sits on two electric burners with no problem.  The butter melted beautifully and the onion/celery mix cooked just right.  The size and height of the pan also made it easy to mix the bread in without making a mess.  The next morning, the turkey roasted perfectly and after I removed it, I was able to place the roaster on top of the stove to make fabulous gravy.  I've made 24 chicken enchiladas and I plan to make a huge lasagna or macaroni and cheese when I have to bring something for a family gathering.  I'll probably line the bottom with Reynolds Pan Lining Paper though to protect the mirror finish.  I like that the roasting rack is stainless steel so it can be scrubbed free of residue and the pan cleaned up nicely with Barkeeper's Friend.  This is a piece of cookware that you'll find many uses for and be proud to own.  UPDATE:  Still a wonderful pan as of 11/13/2013 but there is one caveat.  Be sure to wear oven mitts that cover the forearm.  While wearing the glove-style mitts (think Ove Glove), I took out my pot roast and while pulling apart the foil, one of the handles burned my arm between the wrist and elbow.  Of course that is my fault, but I will need buy longer length mitts that protect more of my arm when using this roaster.;Outstanding Roaster for Many Uses
152;145.0;1.0;12.0;I don't usually write these reviews. When I receiver the roaster, all looked great, seemed very heavy duty. After using two times, the clad is peeling off.  Now it is too late to return the piece.  Why would a company like Cuisinart make something so awful? It's Cuisinart for goodness sake, that is all I use.  I seen similar reviews, but figured somebody did something wrong to make the pealing happen, guess not!;Peeling after two uses!
208;146.0;5.0;14.0;I purchased this item for Thanksiving in particular, as I had always used aluminum disposables. I decided to spring for a nice durable roasting pan thinking I would start roasting my own chickens every week. That didn't happen, but I am still thrilled with this purchase.  I researched extensively this pan and the two muli-ply options from All Clad. I went this this one primarily for the price point, and the fact that it actually had better reviews than the the other brand. The other thing that pushed this to the forefront was the fact that the rack also was stainless, not non-stick, which is a factor in any cookware purchases for our household now.\n\nI have used this pan over twenty times now since receiving it the day before Thanksgiving, even though only once using it for poultry. In that instance, despite my slight worry that it was going to be a huge pain to clean the rack, it actually worked great by following the instructions to spray the rack with something like Pam. (I used olive oil in a Misto.) I soaked the rack in dishwater for about twenty minutes after cooking and it did take time to make sure every nook and cranny was clean, but no hard scrubbing was required. The skin crisped up great, and nothing really melted on it to the extent that I questioned my decision on not doing a throw away pan.\n\nUsing this pan with rack removed is what has most impressed me, likely because I never had never been in a household to use more than disposable pans. I actually leave it easily accessible because it is not a uni-purpose as I originally assumed. I have used it to make baked pastas, and because it is so large it works great for doing two recipes in one dish. We are a two person household, and do not generally eat the same meals. So doing half baked ziti with ground beef for him and half baked ziti with veggies for me more than fits in the pan and saves on clean up time and sink space. (Yes I know cooking in the same pan is probably not an option for many mixed eating households, but in this case, I do not mind a small amount of meat maybe touching the side of my food. I just opt to not eat it.)  I have used it to roast veggies mostly, and for me, I like doing it in the because I can stir them without making a mess and do not have to be as careful as with a baking sheet. Also, since the sides are so high you can just chop and toss the vegetables into the pan as you go and season and toss in place. I've also done one bacon wrapped meatloaf that got rave reviews (on the rack) which cooked very quickly and evenly and ended up much less greasy than having it sit in it's fat while it cooked.\n\nThe pan cleans up great, I use stainless steel cookware all the time, so I know a quick soak means an easy clean up. While I understand most people prefer the easy wipe off of non stick, I personally prefer to err on the side of caution and would rather soak and scrub a little if required than take the health risk of the easier option.  It looks to be made well, the handles are beyond heavy duty and support the weight well.  The only gripe I really have, and it is so small it does not affect my rating, it that if you look at the underside of the pan you can see the rolls in the steel.  As far as I can tell it is still flat and level, but you can see them. In case that bothers anyone else, I think it's important to let that be known. I did notice this straight out of the box, but didn't really worry about it. And for the great price, I didn't expect it to be A.C. perfection.;Great for more than just poultry
238;147.0;4.0;14.0;I was searching for a good Stainless steel cookware set and consider buying from Kitchen Aid, Cuisinart, Emeril, All-clad, Belqique etc., All-clad is expensive for similar sets and was out of my budget. This MultiClad Pro model from Cuisinart had great reviews for a reasonably priced set. It's probably tad bit higher as you can find similar sets for around $150 and sub-$200.\n\nFinally I pulled the trigger on this one, but not in Amazon. I bought it from Buydig.com for substantially less ($213 after 10% off coupon during Black friday weekend sale). So, if you like this particular set, shop around. Because, I noticed Amazon is selling above-average prices compared to the market.\n\nAs far the product, this set is made of heavy, high quality steel. I couldn't test the durability yet. But, it looks to hold up for a long time to come, hopefully. As other reviewers pointed out, there is going to be discoloration and stuff, but as long as u are a little patient in cleaning these vessels as per the manufacturer's direction, these things will appear new for a long time. You can also use Barkeepers cleaning powder or something.\n\nThanks for the Amazon community for all the reviews. Even most other sites had 4.5 star average reviews for this set. The other sub-$200 sets, most of the reviews from different sites were below 4 stars and some reviews made me think its probably worth spending $50 more or so to get a better set than regretting later. So, hopefully I got the right one. They look soo great and has a good heft to it. 4 stars because I don't know the durability. Will probably update it after some time.;Good Product

96;149.0;5.0;9.0;"Quality, quality, quality.......That was my first impression un-boxing this set.  The weight of these pans (even the little 8"" skillet) is impressive.\nAs far as looks go, they are beautiful.  But looks and weight are not enough to really judge how good a set of cookware is.......\n\nFar ahead of purchasing these, I did some research on how to properly cook with stainless steel.  I won't be giving a cooking lesson here, but after making 6 omelets, cooking bacon, stuffed cabbage and soup here's what I discovered:\n\n1. These pans conduct heat extremely well (and evenly), so I've never used any temp setting above medium.  You will find that lower settings give superior results.\n\n2. The pans have to be preheated before cooking.  I kept a cup of water and did the ""mercury ball test"".  If you throw a few drops of water into the pan and it just steams away, it's not ready.  When you do it again, if the water ""dances"" around the pan (That's the best way I can describe it) its ready.\n\n3. When making eggs, (which some dread in stainless steel) if the pan is preheated properly and when butter is then added (left to almost brown) then the eggs are added and they will not stick.  I was able to slip and slide the omelet around the pan with ease.\n\n4. Bacon/Meat-Even with the pan properly preheated and using a very small amount of oil, the proteins in the meat will stick to the pan.  The bacon wasn't ""glued"" to the pan, so to speak, I was able to turn them over like normal.\n\n5. Cleaning after searing/frying meat:  If you use this methodology, cleaning is a breeze.  First, NEVER pour cold water into these pans if they are still hot!  After I was done cooking the bacon, I poured some boiling water into the pan and used a flat bamboo scraper to loosen what was adhering to the pan (You could deglaze at this point as well and save all those ""bits"" for something else). I poured that off and then used some Barkeepers Friend (a cheap but wise investment if you want to keep your pans looking great) and they cleaned up perfectly.\n\nIn summary, if you want a set of versatile cookware that will last for many years these are it.";Quality, quality, quality

73;153.0;5.0;8.0;"I bought this to replace my 10"" Circulon Unison frying pan that is about 5 years old. I cook a lot and would consider myself a serious home chef. I chose this pan after using the 8"" nonstick frying pan and 12-pc Multi-Clad Pro set at my vacation house since 2012.  I believe this to be the best nonstick pan I have ever cooked with. Better than Circulon Unison nonstick. Better than Analon Professional Nonstick. And slightly better than the LeCrueset Stainless Steel nonstick.  Generally, the Cuisinart MCP cookware is excellent and I would say it comes close to the AllClad TriPly in my main home of which I have an extensive collection and have invested $$$$.  The MCP is lighter for those who struggle with heavier pans however still has excellent conductivity on my gas ranges.  I have seen feedback saying the handles were loose--Not the case with all the pieces of MCP I have purchased since 2012. Also seen a couple of buyers talking about discoloration--again NOT the case with mine and I cook like a chef using gas burners. I suspect that people probably had their burners too high despite the instructions.  As with my high end AllClad, the Cuisinart MCP has excellent and even conductivity so pams get hot fast over medium high heat. I rarely have to use a high flame to cook anything or bring a pot to boil. So I have not seen any discoloration on my MCP pans and I am a serious cook! They clean up nicely in the dishwasher using Finish tabs for detergent.  Trust me as an AllClad guy for 20 years--the Cuisinart MultiCladPro is a great economic alternative to very expensive AllClad if you don't cook enough to justify the investment of $$$$$ for AllClad. I have recommended Cuisinart MCP to my friends and realities with my high regards.";I believe this to be the best nonstick pan I have ever cooked with
170;154.0;2.0;12.0;"Good concept, but unstable & dangerous design. To make it ""universal"", Cuisinart designed multiple steps to fit into 2, 3, 4 qt MCP pots. Unfortunately, the design provides only 1/2"" surface to fit against the base pot -- compared to 1-1/2"" surface in other steamer inserts that I have been using for 30 yrs.

Ultimately, it depends on your needs.\n\nIf your need is for trophyware, for pots and pans the look gorgeous, then buy All-Clad and do not cook with them. Cook with  a couple of cheap pans you keep in a drawer, while the ACs hang all sparkly in the kitchen.\n\nIf you cook, buy Cuisinart MCP-66. It is undercutting All-Clad with product that is 95% of the quality and half the price. There is some evidence that it tarnishes more easily, but so what?

135;168.0;5.0;9.0;I have owned AllClad pots and pans for over 10 years and have been very pleased.  They are part of the family, and do their job night after night with no issues.  For those of you who don't know, the Cuisenart MCP is Cuisenart's attempt to duplicate the excellent cooking properties of AllClad pans for a fraction of the price.  The bottom line is that they have succeeded, and have even improved on AllClad's already excellent design.\n\nI bought this particular pan to replace a Tajine which my daughter now has at her place.  While this looks nothing like a Tajine, it functions perfectly for this style of cooking.  The basic pan is low and flat like a tajine.  The lid fits tightly allowing the food to gently steam braise over very low heat.  It makes  Just the right amount of food for 2 people.  But...\n\nThis pan  is far more versatile.  The heating is very even due to the aluminum core.  It's perfect for searing meat, then building a sauce over the brown bits, then slowly simmering.  This pan is really good for reducing sauces, and the low sides facilitate evaporation of the steam.  It's also excellent for steaming shellfish.  I've used it once to cook a small roast, starting on the stove top to brown and then finishing as a braise in the oven.  It's perfect for that, and no long handle to get in your way.  My wife also made potatoes au gratin in this and it was perfect.  So you can fry, saute, braise, and bake all in this pan.  It's a very handy piece of cooking gear.\n\nJust remember that the 3 quart size is small-good for 2 people but it isn't big enough to serve a family.  I like this pan so much, I bought the 5 quart version for serving a larger crowd.\n\nI said they had improved on AllClad's pans so I guess I should explain that.  The price is an obvious one.  To get the price low, these pans are made in China.  If that bothers you, buy the AllClad which is made in the USA.  Another improvement is that these pans can go on an induction burner.  My older AllClads cannot.  The biggest improvement in these pans though, is a simple one.  The Cuisinart MCP pans come with a flared edge.  While this doesn't seem like a big deal, it makes pouring liquids out of these pans much less prone to spills, or running down the sides.\n\nIf there is one improvement I would make to these pans it would be to dome the lid about 1-2 inches higher.  That would be a nice touch, so Quisinart, if you're listening, that's my suggestion.\n\nIn summary, these are great pans at a surprisingly good price.  They actually are better than they should be at this price point.  I am almost sad to say they are as good AllClad pans which I have loved for many years.  In truth, I bought these pans to try out, expecting to to give them to my daughter and buy the AllClad versions for myself.  I am rethinking that strategy now.;Very nice pans, fantastic price.

143;173.0;4.0;9.0;"Basically,  I think I am going to like this cookware set.  Very heavy duty,  but not very Ergonomic that's for sure.  Handles are not pretty and too skinny to hold.  Same with pot lid handles.  But I can live with that since it was in our price range.  My major beef when I first got them all out of the box is that all the pieces seem to be SMALL SCALE !  If you had a medium size family to cook for,  you'd never have enough room in the pots to cook a dinner.  I like to cook meals in Quantity so there will be plenty of leftovers.  These pieces were even smaller than most of my old pots.  I was able to put the Cuisinart pots INSIDE my old pots !  See what I mean.  It makes them look like a Children's set to play with little Dollies or something.  (But I am a manly carpenter who sees them as Tools really.)  But I guess that is what you get buying a set,  all small pans.  Well if they intended for me to buy more pans to complete my set,  they were right, that's what I had to do.  Their 3.5 saute pan was the same as a 10"" skillet so I ordered the 5.5 saute pan which is so much better and Useful.  And their 8 qt. stockpot looked really small, so I ordered the 12 qt. stockpot which is way better and more useful (I make alot of tomato sauce from scratch).  NOW I have as set I can USE !  Cost about an additional $130. Not really that bad.  After checking capacity of the 8 and 12 qt. stockpots.  They are only that,  if filled to the brims.  Otherwise they are actually 7qt. & 11qt., leaving no extra room at the tops.  I told you they run small.  Paul in Rhode Island";12-Piece set is  - SMALL SCALE -

213;176.0;5.0;11.0;"I recently purchased the 3-quart casserole and quickly found that the size/shape of this item finds many uses in my cooking routine - a high-sided (but not too wide) pan for finishing pasta in sauces; a convenient stove-to-oven baking dish; a substitute for a saucepan in caramelizing sugar (wider surface area makes the caramelization go much faster, while being easy to control darkening at the same time). And right now my favorite dinner rolls recipe is puffing magnificently in this pan!\n\nOther Cuisinart pieces I own and love include the Multiclad 6-quart pot and the Cuisinart Everyday pan, a large skillet.

146;177.0;4.0;9.0;First, I MUST tell buyers that the weight of this pan is amazing. BUT it may not fit into every oven without major surgery. We have a GE Profile drop-in electric range (pretty darn standard for a home appliance) and the handles that stick out made this pan far too wide to slide in sideways, and when we tried it front to back, the oven door would not close. Now, I do not recommend anyone do this, but my partner put it on the nearby carpet and forced all his weight down on it and was finally able to bend the handles in to total 18 inches so it would go into the oven! Now - I must add I bought this to try fast-cooking a 14 lb turkey at 500 degrees for an hour and a half total (and I will never do turkey the slow drying-out way again!) And it also must be noted that this pan stood up to the task with NO sign of duress! And the gravy I made from the drippings across two burners on the stove top had no hot spots. I actually LOVE this pan! But important to give the overall dimension INCLUDING handles to be sure it fits on YOUR oven!  And good luck.;I MUST tell buyers that the weight of this pan is amazing.

40;179.0;3.0;5.0;3 stars because I can't rate it's cooking abilities. Like too many others, my new pan arrived with several half-inch or so gouges that went through the steel into the aluminum layer below. If they'd been on the outside of the pan I wouldn't have minded much, as the price was very good, but they were all where the floor transitions to the sidewalls, a place where food is sure to collect. Cuisinart needs to seriously invest in improved quality control.  Returned for refund.;Like too many others
176;180.0;2.0;10.0;"I was suspicious when the package arrived and nowhere on the box did it say the pan was 18/10 stainless steel.  Nor did it say it on the bottom of the pan.  Cuisinart's website had no info about it either, so I called their customer service.  Sure enough, the rep told me that unless there is an 18/10 symbol on the bottom of the pan, it is NOT 18/10 but is 18/0.  He said there is no way to know when you buy their cookware if you are getting the 18/10 or 18/0 because it is not advertised on the outside of the box anywhere.  He said some have it, some don't and you won't know until you open it up and look at the bottom of the pan.  WHAT??!!  He claims there is no difference in quality between the two and that is why they don't advertise it.  So when you buy any of these products from Amazon, you won't know if you're getting 18/10 until you open the box.  I am highly disappointed in Cuisinart.  From the small amount of research I did, it seems that the absence of nickel in the 18/0 makes it much more likely to rust and possibly less durable.  Amazon, however, is great as always in providing a refund for this item.\n\nUpdate:  I replaced this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cooks-Standard-Multi-Ply-Clad-Stainless-Steel-10-Piece-Cookware-Set/dp/B00421AYJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cooks Standard Multi-Ply Clad Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set</a>\nThis set is 18/10, only costs $150 and the handles are much more comfortable.";This seems pretty good, BUT it is NOT 18/10 stainless steel as advertised

133;183.0;2.0;8.0;"Let me preface this by telling you I rarely write reviews. If I wrote a thorough review about every item I purchased from Amazon, I'd be writing for a very long time. If I write a review, it's because I have a strong opinion about a product.\n\nI really wanted this roasting pan to be ""the one.""  My forever roasting pan, the one that would last with proper care and would not need to be replaced for as long as I am upright and cooking.  My goal was to replace a Kirkland roasting pan that had been in service for 14 years. There was nothing wrong with that roaster, except the rack had begun to flake and rust, rendering it (the rack) useless.  The pan itself had a non-stick surface, which was in good condition.  However, I felt the need to replace it as I am using non-stick surfaces less and less and prefer multi-clad cookware.\n\nAfter researching what was available, I narrowed my options down to this pan and an All-Clad flared roaster. Ultimately, I decided to purchase the Cuisinart roaster as the majority of reviews were positive and it appeared to meet all of my needs while being a more reasonably priced item. When the pan arrived, I was excited to try it out. (Yes, I'm one of those people that get excited about cookware.)  After a close inspection, it seemed to be of good quality, though there were already a few scratches on the interior and the rack was a bit thinner than I would have liked. Not ideal, but if it performed well, not a deal-breaker either.\n\nI used it the first time to roast a ham, which turned out perfectly hammy. (I mean, come on, it's a ham, and how good can it really be? Lol) Anyway, while washing the pan, I noticed that there were more scratches than before, probably from the roasting rack moving around. Still, not a big deal.  After washing, there were some mineral deposits which were easy to remove. However, I also noticed a few spots that appeared to be pitting. After trying to clean the pan again, hoping these spots were not the dreaded pitting that I had read about in the negative reviews. They were. \n\nThough I knew better, I decided to try the pan again, hoping that no more pitting would occur. This time, I roasted a turkey. The pan did its job and the turkey was delicious. Though I had hoped to be able to make gravy in the roasting pan, I decided against it as I didn't want to cause any additional scratches. I was already ""babying"" it, which defeated the purpose of buying this type of pan.  After washing, there were more scratches. Again, they seemed to come from the rack moving around in the pan. Scratches happen, but I've never seen this extent of scratching from any of my other multi-clad cookware after minimal use.  And, of course, even more pitting had occurred. \n\nIf you are familiar with pitting, you know it is NOT the same as mineral deposits. Mineral deposits can discolor your cookware giving it a white spotted appearance, but can be removed with a minimal amount of effort if you use the right product.  Pitting, however, is what occurs when pieces of the finish erode, causing a pock-like appearance. If you run your fingers over the areas in question, you will be able to feel pits in the surface. This obviously cannot be scrubbed away and can ultimately cause rust in the eroded areas. I'm guessing that rust may not have a place on your menu.\n\nAfter 10 years of use (and sometimes abuse), none of my other multi-clad cookware has shown any sign of scratching to the extent that this piece has after only 2 uses.  And the pitting. Good grief. I find the pitting absolutely unacceptable. In my opinion, this product is an embarrassment to the Cuisinart name.\n\nYour experience with this product may be different than mine. I don't know what you expect from your cookware. You may be okay with a lot of scratches and pitting. Or maybe you just don't notice things like that. Maybe you don't plan on using this roaster very often, so it doesn't bother you.  I planned on using this roaster at least once a week, so I was very disappointed when it didn't perform as I anticipated. As for me, I'm sending the Cuisinart back to Amazon and will be visiting my favorite kitchen store.  I know I'll pay more there, but I think I'll have a much better chance of finding ""the one.""";What do YOU expect from your cookware?

I have a gas range which I feel always has a big difference on cook ware. I put them in the dishwasher and have had no issue with pitting or anything else, they come out clean and sparkling. Occasionally some things do stick, but a little bar keepers friend and light scrubbing and warm water, you can hardly tell that they have been used at all. If you use plastic or silicone utensils to cook with, it will keep the surfaces from being scuffed or scratched. A friend used them and made the mistake of using metal and they did scratch the bottom of the one large pot. The handles do stay relatively cool, part of the reason they get hot at least in my circumstance, is my burners are slightly offset and sometimes excess heat leaks around and can heat up the handle slightly. If I move the pot off to the side, a few seconds later they are perfectly cool. They look very nice and perform as expected.;Nice set of pots

I've also cut my finger open another time when I was rinsing the pan and it barely slipped through my fingers.

Yes, they look great when you first use them, then after six months they look like something made in a third world country.

Try that with nonstick cookware, I dare you!\n\nHeat: these heat fast and evenly.  They're not as thick as All Clad, but I like this because it makes them more responsive to heat.\n\nDurability: this things are built to last, they take a beating and keep on going.  I've even used one to hammer nails, in a pinch!\n\nFinish: personally, I like the brushed exterior/mirrored interior, but I will note that the mirror finish will become scratched up as you use and scrub it.  However, its smoothness still makes the pan easy to clean; not as easy as nonstick, but close.  The finish has not showed any signs of discoloration or rusting yet.  As with all stainless cookware, it benefits from periodic polishing.\n\nFeatures:  the pots have flared lips to make it easy to pour, and the length and balance on handles are just right.  All cookware is oven safe and broiler-safe (should be fine up to 500F and up).  This is particularly helpful because you can roast a chicken in the frying pan, and then take it stovetop to cool or make gravy.  My only complaint with features is the steel lids: the handles are not *quite* tall enough to keep fingers off the hot surface. I generally prefer tempered glass lids, to see the insides.  But I'm still pretty happy with this overall.\n\nOverall: *VERY* happy with my MultiClad Pro cookware, and liking it more the longer I have it. The 7 piece set has exactly the pieces & sizes I use and nothing I don't.  Tip: you can use the bottom of the stockpot in place of a deep skillet to saute.  The smallest pot I use daily for heating water like a kettle. Combine the MCP-7N set with a nonstick pan (I suggest the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bakers-Chefs-10-Nonstick-Restaurant-Fry-Pan/dp/B0024NOY3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bakers & Chefs 10"" Nonstick Restaurant Fry Pan</a>), and you have all the cookware you need!";Professional quality at a reasonable price

97;218.0;5.0;5.0;"My review considers three versions of the pots & pans.\n\n18/10 Version\n\nI originally purchased this set in 2007 and have added several pieces since. My original set, and some of the add-ons, are 100% 18/10 steel. They are marked so on the bottom. The pans are stilling going strong and I've had no complaints.\n\nStainless Steel - Induction Ready Version\n\nAt some point (2010?) the 18/10 stamp was removed from the pans. Some of my add-on pans are from this period. My magnet test tells me that the handles, lids, and cooking surface are still 18/10 but the exterior steel is not. The exterior of these pans tend to stain easier than the 18/10 versions. Otherwise I have had no issues or complaints with my purchases.\n\nStainless Steel N Version\n\nThis is the latest version as of this posting. I have one N pot. The make-up of the steel seems to remain unchanged from the prior version (some 18/10, some 18/0). The handles have been redesigned. To me this appears to be a manufacturing cost-savings choice. The handles went from a rounded design to a more square shape. I suspect straight edges are cheaper to manufacture than rounded edges. On the long-handled pots one might view the new handles as an improvement as the old oval handles came to a sharpish point at the end. The new stock, sauce, and helper handles are a definite downgrade. The older versions were rounded with finger grooves and nice and comfy. The new versions are straight, flat, and with sharp edges. I prefer the versions with the older handles but it comes down to a matter of taste.\n\nAll versions\n\nIn my experience these pots & pans perform as advertised. I performed a test cooking bacon side by side with my 1920's Griswold cast iron skillet. The MultiClad skillet cooked much more evenly than the cast iron. They are not non-stick so that requires some practice to achieve satisfactory results or you could just purchase the add on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cuisinart-MCP22-24NSN-MultiClad-Pro-Nonstick-Stainless-Steel-10-Inch-Skillet/dp/B009W28NDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cuisinart MCP22-24NSN MultiClad Pro Nonstick Stainless Steel 10-Inch Skillet</a>&nbsp;with the non-stick coating. They are not too hard to keep clean but I am not trying to maintain the out of the box appearance. They are durable but over time surface scratches build up. The long handles stay cool. The shorter stock pot style handles do get hot.\n\nAre they every bit as good as All-Clad? No they are not. All-Clad offers 100% 18/10 and fully polished pans. My perception in handling All-Clad pots is that they are heavier and therefore I suspect the steel is thicker. All-Clad has a much better warranty and customer service. MultiClad is made in China, so initial quality control can occasionally be an issue. If money is no object, or your pans must withstand heavy abuse, go with All-Clad. Otherwise these are a great economical option.";Three Wolf Moon Stainless Review

188;220.0;5.0;7.0;I already have a full set of the Cuisinart Multi Clad Cookware and have been using it for several months now. I purchased a few more duplicate pieces just this past week. (I seem to always be using the smaller pots and needed more of them). This set was bought to replace a set of copper clad Revere Ware my Mother gave me many years ago (which has moved on to another appreciative owner). The Cuisinart is simply incredible. It is heavy and solid, and the easiest to clean up. It has remained beautiful. I keep mine in a cupboard, but it is so beautiful it can easily be hung up for display. I had some hesitancy before I made my original purchase based on some other reviewers comments about it not cleaning up well, leaving marks and/or spots in the bottom of the pans, etc. Yes, this is true, it occurs on my set as well, but it is because some water (hard, with minerals in it) does that, BUT, all of it comes off with the use of Barkeeper's Friend (I prefer the liquid to the powder, I feel it works much better). I use my pots and pans every day, but with proper use and cleaning, it has remained looking like new. I love this set, and I am certain it is the last set I will ever have to buy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!;Best Set of Cookware, Period.
100;221.0;5.0;5.0;Let me start by saying I am an All Clad guy.  I really would never even consider another brand of pan.  I have just been that happy with their products.  Now it has come time to outfit a kitchen of a second house, that will not see a ton of use.  I really could not justify another All Clad set, for this application.  Based on the positive reviews, I bought this set.  I am completely blown away.  they far exceeded my expectations.  They are beautiful, have heavy thick chassis and lids that I would mistake for my All Clad pans.  I recently purchased a single All Clad saute pan for 30% more than this entire set.  Had I know of the quality of these pans...I may never have purchased a single All Clad pan.  Very nice.;I have just been that happy with their products
189;222.0;5.0;7.0;I was worried about sticking and the bottoms turning yucky. All of the teflon pans I have have darker stained bottoms but these pans after a few months of use still look brand new. I have had a few things stick but after soaking for 5 minutes with a cap full of vinegar it comes right off. I wish I had made the switch years ago!;best pans ever!
254;223.0;4.0;8.0;After the first use the shiny surface took some kind of tarnished blemishes. Still it is a good piece of equipment and I am sure, after cooking a delicious prime rib, that it will take on a delicious 20 pound turkey as well.  The weight is heavy and I used it briefly on my ceramic stove top to brown as best as I could, the prime rib, before it descended to the oven area where it was cooked to a succulent medium rare in about 45 minutes. It came so glossy and shiny but after its baptism of fire it ended with some blemishes here and there, but besides that, it appeared ready for lots of more action. I better say that I never owned one of these and I am happy, however tedious is to put it away in our limited space, to have one now. I was going to buy the more expensive one by Calphon?, but money had been running amok while buying this and that (by golly, it never seems to end, there is always one more thing that calls the attention) that I was glad the price of this Cuisinart MCP117-16BR Multiclad Pro Stainless 16-Inch Rectangular Roaster with Non-Stick Rack was being offered at a serious discount. I do like Cuisinart so I bought it. Will not give it 5 Stars at this stage and I do agree that sometimes when you review a product on its first use it does not tell the tale, but I was excited when it arrived so perhaps I couldn't wait. I thank the many amazon reviewers that overall keep me away from buying the wrong choices. This one worked right out of the box, it got a little tainted for it, but like a brand new car driven out of the lot, it should have been expected to loose that gloss it arrived with. 4 Stars.;Efficient but tarnished
224;224.0;4.0;7.0;I've only used them once.. but so far so good. They made their debut wash in the dishwasher and came out gleaming. I used the 10in pan to cook up some Beef Stroganoff using only a plastic spatula and yet the mirror finish on the inside is no more. It almost looks like there is food still stuck to the pan. I have not tried the Bar Keepers Friend Cleanser & Polish yet to see if that works in bringing back the shine. If not, oh well.. They were meant to be used, not look pretty on display.\nUpdate: I used the Bar Keepers Friend Cleanser & Polish and holy cow the mirror finish is back! It only took a little bit and with a quick rub with a towel the pan looks brand new again. I highly recommend spending the $5 for the Bar Keepers Friend Cleanser & Polish with these pans.;So far so good
157;225.0;5.0;6.0;I have been thinking of replacing the teflon-coated pans and during my study, I realized that this is the best pan to meet my overall requirements.  First, the reason for the purchase was to use a healthier product.  Teflon, ceramic, aluminum, all can give off harmful chemicals.  Cast iron is a great choice but is not easy to use day in and day out.  The cast iron with a coating was not an option given the health concerns.  So this limited my choice to stainless steel.  Stainless steel has a bad reputation about inconsistent heating and cooking and cleanup.  The cuisinart multi-clad series addressed all my concerns.  This product has a thick aluminum core extending up the sides of the pan, making it a little heavy.  The helper has proven to be very useful.  For cleanup, I heard that you can boil some water in the pan after use and once it cools, it cleans up easily.  This was a great tip!  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone wanting a great quality product that will not harm your health!;The best skillet I have ever owned!

One of the main selling points is the 18/10 Steel.  If you look elsewhere at reviews for the similar product that is NOT18/10 steel they are pretty bad.  However I showed my husband the Amazon reviews and we were sold.  The set arrived today and I was a little concerned that there was no advertisement for 18/10 steel on the exterior of the Cuisinart box.  When I opened it up and began to inspect the pots I noticed right away that they were simply labeled ""Stainless Steel.""  I did some internet searches and was able to look at other Cuisinart pots and pans paying special attention to the markins on the bottom.  The ones containing 18/10 steel were plainly marked ""18/10 Stainless Steel.""  We are going to return the set and try it again.  Amazon is usually very good about customer service and it is entirely possible that some inferior sets end up getting shipped to their customers.  I will update the posting to reflect what we think of the correct product.\n\nUpdate.  Second set still not 18/10 but still looks great.  Amazon should revise the ad.";Not 18/10 steel as advertised.
172;230.0;2.0;6.0;I really wanted this pan to work out. I saw it reviewed by the test kitchen and it seemed like a decent price. I was really hoping the quality issues noted in other reviews had been fixed. They haven't been.\n\nI used the pan one time to cook a turkey. I gently hand washed it before using the first time. We cooked the turkey, everything about the pan seemed great. I didn't make gravy so there was no wisking or using the pan on the burners. When the turkey was done, I dumped the contents and let it soak for about 15 mins then wiped out with a soft cotton cloth by hand. Like I said, I really wanted this pan to work out. There were three obvious pitts in the steel that hadn't been there before cooking. I can't imagine how poorly the pan performs under normal use like wisking gravy and dishwasher cleanings. I had to return it.;The quality problems are true

183;232.0;5.0;6.0;My cooking utensils preferences are Stainless Steel and Cast-Iron. The biggest difficulty with stainless steel has been its tendency to burn the food near the heat source. (Bottom of the pan) With the Cuisinart product, this has been virtually eliminated. The multiClad base evenly distributes the heat very effectively. As a test, I made up a large batch of chocolate pudding. Using these pans, I can say, this was the first time in my life that the bottom of the pan wasn't covered with burnt chocolate.\nI enjoyed these pots and pans soo much, I ordered an additional 3 sets and sent them off as gifts.\nThe downside, so far, is that there needs to be more variety in the pot sizes. Perhaps a 24 piece set with mixed sizes would address this. Meanwhile, I will continue to search the web sites in an effort to increase this collection.\nMy existing stainless steel pots and pans with their thin walled bottom and sides are out of here.\nThank You for providing a Fine Product .;Another Great Product

138;234.0;5.0;5.0;I had my sights set on All Clad to replace my Cuisinart Chefs Classic set, but after reading several reviews from various websites, as well as comparisons, I decided on this beautiful set. I could not be happier with my purchase. I have used every piece in the set as well as a second 3.5 quart saut pan and 4 quart pot purchased separately several times in the past weeks. They outperform CCC on every level, from boiling water, simmering soups, sauting, caramelizing etc. I even accidentally left grains on the stove too long and a had a burnt layer at the bottom of the pot! I had hoped that it could be cleaned up, and put some hot water and dish soap in the pot and let it sit for bit and voila, the whole burnt layer of grains came right off and left no mark or residue! A quick hand wash and it was as good as new.\n\nA few tricks I use to keep them looking like new are:\n\nNever heat above 7 on electric or medium high on a gas stove.\n\nAlways heat the pan for a minute or two before adding oil/butter.\n\nNever put salt in a cold pan. Add in after water has heated (in the instance of cooking pasta)\n\nLet oil/butter heat before adding food.\n\nDon't use abrasive sponges to clean them.\n\nTo bring back their shine if lost use Bar Keeper's Friend.\n\nI recommend this set. Don't let the price fool you, this is superior cookware and I look forward to using this set for many years to come.;Superior performance!

I have other racks which are flat with ""feet"" and are better suited for ribs, brisket and other flat meats.\n\n I especially love the handles. They are large and very easy to grip even with heavy oven mitts. Clean up is an easy task if you immediately fill the pan with water and a bit of dish soap and soak until after dinner. I wouldn't even bother with a dishwasher here, it could develop a film or get scratched.

206;249.0;2.0;5.0;On the pro-side, this is a perfectly serviceable set of cookware. They do do what they are supposed to do. That being said, here are a few things to consider.\n\n1. A mirror finish on any set of cookware that's going to be used regularly is, to put it simply, a stupid idea. I shrugged it off, and am now continuously annoyed.\n\n2. The sizing of the stuff included in this set is, like many sets of pots and pans, a little off. It's functional, but less than ideal. * For a family, the 8-inch skillet is too small to cook much of anything in, except maybe the occasional breakfast for one. But... it's stainless steel, so no one in their right mind would cook eggs or other potentially sticky food in it when they could just use cast-iron or non-stick.\n* The 10-incher is better, and suitable for lots of stuff, but again, I find that I almost always prefer a 12-inch for most of my cooking (for two adults and two kids). So it's just enough, but not ideal.\n* The stock pot is a bit too big and the sauce pans a bit too small to comfortably make most of the standard things the average family makes (a package of pasta, a decent sized but not enormous batch of soup). Again... I'm annoyed nearly every time I want to use these. For future reference, I'll look a lot more closely at the sizing and try to find local examples before buying online. I love Amazon, but this particular purchase didn't work out very well.;These are OK, but in hindsight I would have purchased something else.
215;250.0;5.0;5.0;We recently bought a new set worth of Cuisinart pots and pans, but did not get non-stick. After using them for a while we decided having some non-stick pans would be helpful for some things. We bought both the 10in and 12in versions of this pan, and both are excellent. Very heavy duty, and the non-stick surface is easy to clean. Highly recommended.;Heavy Duty And Easy To Clean
223;251.0;5.0;5.0;"The Cookware is HEAVY.  The entire set weighs 28 pounds (shipping) and is boxed very nicely.  Not a scratch or ding in any of the cookware upon inspection at delivery.  The saucepans and stock pot are nice and tall and extremely heavy.  You can tell by the weight of these things that you'll never see them dent.  The lids are thin and light weight by comparison.\n\nI cooked a fried chicken dinner using these and found that they cleaned up easily in the dishwasher.  The saute pan however showed some signs of discoloring on the outer sides so I hand washed it after pulling it from the dishwasher.  After drying, the spots re-appeared.  I put it in the dishwasher again and tried using a different dishwashing detergetent to no avail, the spots remained.  I then tried some isopropyl alcohol on a cotton cloth and the spots wiped right off.  Two runs through the dishwasher and a hand wash didn't clean it but a quick wipe with alcohol and it was flawless and shiney again., nice.\n\nI concluded that some glue or residue got onto the surface of the pan and would not let go using traditional soaps.  I'm guessing that the alcohol broke down the residue chemically so that it could be removed.  You might want to give this a try before you start scrubing the nice finish off your cookware.\n\nAfter more use I started to experience what many others have been complaining about; stains started to appear on the cookware.  The wonderful thing about those ""stains"" are that they're not stains in the metal of the cookware but rather stains of food/water/flame residue still stuck to the metal.  I pulled the scratch free Comet cleanser from the cabinet and polished those ""stains"" right off.";Last cookware I'll ever need.
232;252.0;5.0;5.0;I chose this set mostly because of the reviews and from looking at what All-Clad's product/price was compared to Cuisinart's.

CB works great on the ceramic stovetop when foam won't remove as long as the spot is not deep burned, then I have to use Barkeeper's Friend and it does the job!\n4. Used the small fry pan to scramble eggs. Used 2T corn oil on #4 when oil started to bubble poured in eggs, turned down heat to 3 and scrambled. Geeze I had to look to see if it was coated with telflon!! They did not stick and slide right out of the pan. I am using a new GE ceramic top stove to do this, so some burners on other models could not be as hot and need to be set on 4 or whatever to do actual cooking. Main thing is HEAT THE PAN before you put the food in to cook. Do not over heat either or it will grab spots and stick. I did read not to heat to hot or pan could warp. Also do not heat pan very long while empty.\n5. Used the deep fry pan to cook smothered steak...yum!! Again brought heat up to #6 with 1/4 cup of oil. Rolled steak in flour and seasoned, placed in pan and reduced heat to 3 or 4 and browned side well then flipped over using silicone spatula and did same to other side, be sure it's well browned before trying to flip or coating will stick to pan, now add 2 cups or more of water and let simmer with lid on at lowest setting (just so there is a slight boil) and cook for an hour or until tender. Add more water as needed and thicken if desired with flour in water, then add to pan. Pour over hot Pillsbury biscuits (frozen kind) and chow down. Clean up was a breeze again. Soap and water and for some reason no cloudness.....maybe because the heat was turned down low and stayed low!? Do not use metal utensils unless you don't mind scratches. Note: I do the All American Cooking so these have and will get a work out!!\nAND to think I HATED stainless steel all these years! I always cooked on a coil stove and everything stuck tight! I spent some time reading reviews on how ever one was cooking so knew what to do and it worked! Can only say buy these if you want a great set of cookware and a price that is great. All-Clad is just unreal on their prices (not knocking their product just if you have more money than you know what to do with buy) and the reviews are no better than for this set and this product is made the SAME as the high price All-Clad....and these are all clad (meaning they have the aluminum core on bottom and sides. Just be sure to check the weight of the set you are buying, that will let you know what quality you are getting. These are 21.7 lbs, with the shipping weight being 28.2 lbs. Weights on the box! Amazon also listed the weights.\nReceived in good packing condition and fast shipping service. Love Amazon!;Cuisinart MCP12N 12pc set has changed my opinion of stainless steel!
240;253.0;4.0;5.0;The MultiClad Cuisinart pots and pans are great and the best ones that I have purchased. The cook great, don't burn and evenly.  I purchased the whole set for under $200! The only issue that I have is if you want to purchase an additional pan it can be VERY expensive to purchase a lid sisnce they don't come with lids.  A lid for this skillet cast $60!!!  Come on Cuisinart, give me a break . I emailed Cuisinart customer service hoping to get a coupon or discount for the lid but they didn't budge.;Great Skillit, but cover way too expensive!
250;254.0;5.0;5.0;This thing is like restaurant quality. Very sturdy and very beautiful. I am going to make a huge pan of lasagna to christen it.;Top quality
251;255.0;5.0;5.0;"This roaster is everything you need. It is large enough for almost all your needs; if it were bigger it might not fit in your oven, but not overly heavy. The clad design allows you to use it on the stove top to saute vegetables or brown meat, yet it is priced very reasonably,for what you get.";Great product and value
255;256.0;5.0;5.0;I was looking for a good roaster at a reasonable price for over a year. This one is it! The handles are sturdy and it cleans up well. This item was better priced and equal in quality to other roasters at the fancy stores. I've used it twice so far and have been very pleased.;One good roaster
2;257.0;5.0;5.0;This pan arrived overnight.  Thank you Amazon.  I like Cuisinart cookware and this roaster lived up to my expectations.  It's no lightweight: it's large and will hold a lot of food.  I found the handles comfortable and necessary since the pan is heavy.  The handles also allow me to hang it on my pot hooks, although it helps to keep it hanging out of the way of heads that might collide with it in passing. I love the roasting rack.  I am a bread maker and use it to stack my loaves on as they come out of the oven so  they can quickly cool(and I can admire how beautiful they are!). It has a nice shape that allows for roasting vegetables around the poultry or meats that are to be cooked. To top it off the roaster has a nice look.;Versatile roaster

92;1.0;5.0;886.0;"After the cheapo plastic kettle died, I investigated multiple other high-end electric kettles, including Cuisinart, Chef' Choice, Krups, Braun by reading reviews on-line and comparing them @ the local bricks & mortar stores. The Breville is clearly the best designed one for the money.\n\nPros:\n- clean, beautiful design which is also easier to clean.\n- hefty, substantial base unit with place to wrap around the cord\n- boils quickly in 4 min. for full 1.5 L\n- more substantial kettle than more expensive models by Chef's Choice or Cuisinart. The Chef's Tools electric kettle @ the same price point looked flimsier. In fact, the floor model Chef's Choice kettle was no longer closing or opening its lid properly-- always a bad sign when a floor model falls apart.\n- modest yet easily audible ""ping"" sound when the water has come to a boil, and the kettle shuts off automatically.\n- the outlet is easy to pull due to the hollow center design\n\nCons:\n- heavy kettle.\n- occasionally, there's a metallic taste in reboiled water if the water was left inside the kettle for several hours. However, the water tastes fine if you boil a pot from freshly filled water.\n\nOverall, clearly the pros outweigh the cons. We're heavy users of the electric kettle, especially in the winter, boiling water for teas, soups at least 4-5x per day. We'll report back again in a yr after the warranty expires.\n\nUPDATE > 1 yr after post (4/6/08): The Breville Ikon is still going strong. The water seems to be taking a slightly longer time to boil. We still use it 3-4 times per day, and it works well.\n\nUPDATE 12/19/11: Kettle still going strong. We still use it 2-3x/day, and it still works great. Wow. Worth every cent.\n\nUPDATE 1/12/14: We love it and still use it up to 5-6x/day. We take it with us when we travel. We couldn't be happier with this kettle which is still going strong after 8 years of rigorous use. I would love a mini model of this to take for traveling.";Outstanding, long-lasting, high-end electric kettle for price.
2;2.0;5.0;553.0;"While there is typically little difference between any two electric kettles, this one is at least at the top of the spectrum.\n\n1. Being an extremely convenient home appliance ""discovered"" by the Europeans decades ago, and later in the USA, the electric kettle always left one concern: compared to its mundane predecessor it was typically made of plastic inside and out. Which could potentially mean various unhealthy substances emanating into the water from the plastic sides, especially at high boiling temperatures. This one is made of stainless steel and doesn't cause any such concerns.\n\n2. The kettle can be rotated on its cordless base, which makes it easier to put it back on the base than some other models.\n\n3. It has a transparent wall segment to measure water level. While this ""window"" is not located optimally (somewhat shadowed by the handle) and hasn't got a bright floating level marker, this design is sturdier than some others, and is less prone to leaks.\n\n4. Blue back-light that goes on and lights this ""window"" when the kettle is switched on, is a nice touch. It both attracts attention and simplifies reading the water level.\n\n5. It's easy to open the lid, and the opening is wide to add water with no problems or dripping. (In some models the handle partly covers the lid, making it hard to open and/or add water.)\n\n6. Like in most up-to-date models, the heating spiral is NOT located inside the boiling case, but rather underneath it, which makes the design more relaible, and it is also much easier to wash the kettle inside if need be.\n\n7. Time to boil is reasonable and not worse than average.";Good appliance, finally made of stainless steel
93;3.0;5.0;317.0;"Truly a top notch product.  I was tired of lukewarm water ""nuked"" in the microwave for tea or hot chocolate at the office so, after consulting other customer reviews for products under the ""electric kettle"" search, I took the plunge.  A bit expensive, but worth it.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Stainless inside and out.  No plastic taste or chemical worries.\n\n2.  Very comfortable handle, nice curve to it, and totally insulated.\n\n3.  Cord minder on the base bottom; allows you to tailor the cord length to your needs.  Cord very sturdy.\n\n4.  Separate base contains the cord.  The kettle itself reminds me, from the standpoint of heft and size, of an ""old fashioned"" stove top percolator\n\n5.  The removable kettle itself; also, you can turn the kettle around to any point on the base; it doesn't have a notch or fixed position\n\n6.  Construction appears to be quite solid.  Push a button and the top opens up automatically (not just a cheap spring, either).  Glass center insert on top so you can see in; top is also domed to direct condensation back into the pot; haven't had any problem with water dripping onto the counter (or hand!) when opened.\n\n7.  Quick; heating just one mugful of water to boiling is easily faster than the microwave (same time in microwave will leave you with hot, but not boiling water).\n\n8.  Easy to clean; the opening is wide enough to get your hand in, and the top opens up to 90 degrees.  There is a rod that runs up the inside, part of the temperature sensing system, but there's room enough to get a soft cloth behind it, you'd just need to avoid too much force.  Cleaning, however, is not a big deal overall if you use it for its purpose - heating WATER only (don't heat your soup in this; it's not made for it).\n\n9.  Looking at other reviews, it seems that some people like to fill the kettle via spout rather than main opening - spout is nicely sized to easily allow this, if you want.\n\n10.  The water gauge is big, well marked and very nicely lighted, thus easy to read.\n\n11.  Automatic turn-off at boiling temp, and also has a function to avoid boiling dry (The boil turn-off feature kicks in about 30 seconds after you can see the water boiling; I haven't personally tried to boil it dry, so can't comment on that feature).  There's a nice, but soft, single ""ding"" that it makes when it turns off.  You might not hear it from another room, but it shouldn't damage itself by boiling dry, so even if you miss the ding, it's not a big deal.\n\n12.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but to mine its lines are clean, simple and elegant.  Should fit with just about any decor.  Fingerprints on the outside stainless haven't been a big issue; wipes clean with damp cloth.\n\nComments (not ""Cons""):\n\n1.  Regarding another reviewer's comments about weight, it does have some ""heft,"" but on the other hand, it has a good capacity!  To heat one or two cups, it's handy enough.  Stainless steel will be heavier than plastic, so if weight is an issue for you, you may wish to consider this point.\n\n2.  I wish the otherwise nice switch wasn't directly at the bottom end of the handle, but this really isn't a big deal.\n\n3.  I've seen reviews indicating that stainless steel pots get hot on the outside. This one probably does, too (if you put your hand near it after boiling, you can sense the heat). Well, the handle is perfectly insulated, and this is NOT an insulated device.  I wouldn't put my hand on the outside of any ""regular"" metal pot or pan (steel or aluminum, like those found in any kitchen for daily cooking)that had a boiling liquid in it, so I wouldn't do that with this type of device, either!\n\n4.  Reviewers of other kettles have suggested that the device may leak if water is left overnight.  Have not had that problem with this, but then again, we empty it at the end of each day.\n\n5.  Have not had any problems with rust, as has been noted with competing products, but see comments in #4, above.\n\nBefore purchasing, I looked at the competition in stores, and a friend has ""another leading brand"" competetor; this seemed superior to the others in virtually every way (particularly build quality, the others I'd seen seemed rather ""cheap"" despite their price).  Definitely recommend; this is a winner in our office; several people have already bought their own!";"Excellent product; a ""hit"" at the office"
3;4.0;1.0;5.0;I went through two kettles in about 3 years. The first one was very good for about 2 years. The base had stainless steel all around and it was very stable. The newer redesigned model, which was still the same model, has a terrible unstable and wiggly plastic base, but eventually I got used to it. The first kettle stopped getting contact with the base and just stopped working for no apparent reason. The second one died within a year- the plastic around the power button broke by itself, I assume from heat, and the button got pushed in. So, it became unusable unless I wanted to get electrocuted, which I don't:) With all being said, it's not a good unit unless you change your kettles every 10 months or so. It boils fast and doesn't make annoying sounds- that's the only feature I liked. Also, it's not insulated, so keep your fingers on the handle. Better option- don't buy it.;Owned two- both broken- save your money
10;5.0;1.0;70.0;I got this kettle in the hope that throwing money at the problem would get me something really sound.  Instead, it failed on me with the switch disintegrating after about three months (see hole and crack in attached pic).  It nominally has a one year warranty, but a) they never answer the phone, and b) they never call you back when you opt for the we'll-call-you-back option from their customer support.  Altogether, I rate that as shameful for a product that's clearly pitched as a high-end model.\n\nAs far as the kettle itself is concerned, it works reasonably well, but isn't very well designed.  The switch is hard to get to, the water level gauge is mostly obscured by the handle, and it doesn't have a safety interlock that switches it off if the lid is open.  It is also not insulated, so a) could burn you if you touch anywhere other than the handle, and b) it loses its heat fast.  Such design flaws one could have forgiven thirty years ago, but Breville has been making automatic kettles for donkeys years.  There's no excuse for them in a high-end kettle in this day and age.\n\nIf I had got ten years of untroubled use of it, and considering its design flaws I'd have given it three stars.  As it is, given their customer support, I won't be drinking from this well again.;I won't buy from Breville again.
91;6.0;1.0;202.0;For an Englishman abroad (i.e. I need gallons of tea a day), this product looked like the bees knees - the best kettle out there. And it is without doubt a good-looking machine with lots of great features. But unfortunately it has one fatal flaw - the hot water that comes out of it smells of  plastic. I thought this would pass with a bit of use but no, the nasty boiled plastic smell remained. In the end I sent it back and bought a Braun instead. Shame, in every other respect this is an excellent machine.;Nearly...
84;7.0;3.0;193.0;First off, Amazon's part in this was excellent. The product arrived in good shape and ahead of schedule.  The kettle itself was well-designed and of excellent quality. There, however, is where the problem started. On opening it, there was a heavy, oily smell. This is not unusual for steel items, so I went about boiling a couple of kettles as recommended in the instructions. After the sixth time, the oily smell was still present, and was strong enough to contaminate the tea.  I even tried boiling a water-white vinegar solution and leaving it overnight according to the instruction - to no avail. Finally sent it back - a process which was painless and quite easy, by the way.;Quality smells
8;8.0;1.0;47.0;Bought it five months ago and already full with corrosion. How disappointing. According to the company policy this product is not entitled for return which makes it even more disappointing.;Bought it five months ago and already full with corrosion ...
57;9.0;1.0;108.0;I owned two Breville kettles.  They both failed the same way.  I know a lot of people are happy with the Breville kettles but most don't realized after a year or two of constant use, the electric contact between the base and the kettle will soon wear off.  That means, the on button will not light and the unit will not work.  I called Breville and found out that this new unit has the same electric contact mechanism.  If you plan to use this for more than one or two years, I would consider another brand.;Electric contact wears off
69;10.0;1.0;115.0;"Just over a year ago I purchased two Breville Kettles on the basis of good Amazon  reviews. ( We became accustomed to the convenience of electric kettles during a sabbatical year in England and after we returned home, we tried a number of (plastic) kettles, none of which lasted more than a year or so.  We were looking for something more durable and troublefree. )\n\nThe Breville Ikon kettles seemed to be just that during the first year of regular use.  However, our kettles (one in personal use and one  a gift to my son's household) have developed a disturbing pattern of turning themselves on.\n\nWe have been in the habit of leaving the kettle plugged in between uses.  Almost always with water in it. And it functioned reliably for a year.  But now the kettle will occasionally switch itself on and start to boil.  So far it has also turned itself off.....\n\nWhen I phoned the Breville customer service line to discuss this problem, I was informed that I if read the instructions I would see that the kettle should not be left plugged in when it is not in use.  ""Plug it in to use it and unplug it after each use.""\n\nWell, we can accommodate that limitation, but I do not find it convenient. Not to mention the naggling fret of what might happen with a kettle which has developed an attitude of ""  I'll boil when I want to"" .\n\nNice product, but NOT the durable, trouble free one we hoped to find.\n\nOne star because it so failed our durability hopes.";Breville Kettle problems,  after a year of use this kettle turns itself ON!
78;11.0;4.0;94.0;I recently bought this product, which has performed flawlessly so far.  But two things I've noticed are valuable pieces of information for those planning on buying an electric cordless kettle, I think:  First, the water gauge is behind the handle, which means you can't see the water level as you're filling the kettle, since you're holding it by the handle.  This problem is not unique to this kettle, but it is an annoyance.  I've learned about how much water it takes to fill my 16 oz. mug (a count of five), so I don't need to try to look at something that's underneath my hand as the water is running from the faucet. Maybe they're assuming you're going to be using bottled water and won't need to be holding the pot as you're filling it!  My other caution is the very large, dripless spout.  The dripless part is great, and it is truly dripless.  However, it's also very large, so that a TREMENDOUS amount of hot steam escapes as the pot heats up.  You really need to move the pot out completely away from any walls or cupboards or the steam will quickly ruin the finish.  But if you move the pot out toward the edge of the counter, the hot steam may burn you, you spouse, your child, or your cat who suddenly decides to jump up on the counter. You really need to stand by the pot as it is heating up if you have pets.  I have also noticed that our hard water is already leaving deposits on the bottom of the pot in just a few weeks, but that is my cleaning problem, not a problem with the pot.  Another reviewer pointed out that the beautiful brushed finish does not stay beautiful very long no matter what you do, and I have to second that, but it doesn't bother me that much.\n\nInterestingly, I bought another cordless kettle at Target about the same time, a cheap chrome one by Aroma, for my office.  That pot, though smaller, does just as good a job for 1/3 the price, and the finish has stayed nicer.  The smaller spout does not release as much steam.  But it doesn't LOOK nearly as cool. Ha.\n\nAnd here's a comment apropos of nothing:  why can't the makers of these kettles make one with a stainless steel LID?  If we don't want a plastic pot, why would we want a plastic lid?  It boggles the mind.  But try to find a decent pot with a stainless lid.;A very nice, but expensive kettle
99;12.0;4.0;92.0;"I bought the Breville SK500XL two months ago and use it several times a day; it is indeed a nice looking, high quality electric kettle, and I am satisfied with my purchase. Here are several additional points and issues, beyond what was given in Amazon's product description:\n\n1. The main complaint I have about this kettle is that the automatic shut-off mechanism, which detects that the water boils and shuts the power off, has a very slow response. I usually boil only one or two cups of water, and by my estimate the kettle shuts off about 30 seconds too late, after the water has boiled. This not only wastes electricity, but also sends considerable amount of steam up the air. The reason for the slow response may be the very wide spout, which lets the early steam out and keeps the sensor cool longer; when I covered the spout the kettle turned itself off much sooner.\n\nSo - If I happen to stand near the kettle when it starts boiling, then I turn it off myself (it's a little nuisance; the power switch is small and located at the bottom, under the handle).\n\n2. There is a secondary shut-off mechanism, which kicks in if you turn the kettle on with no water inside. I decided to test it - it works!!\n\n3. The kettle's top cover is clear, but you can not see through as it is always covered with condensation droplets.\n\n4. The power cord has an unusual and helpful plug - it has a finger hole in the middle, so you can pull that plug out without pulling on the cord like many people often do.\n\n5. The water level is illuminated in blue, which looks nice in the dark (if you like boiling water with your lights off :-)  However the level is located under the handle, which obscures the water level somewhat.\n\n6. When the water gets hot, so does the kettle's metal body.";A nice high quality kettle, but sluggish shut-off
33;13.0;3.0;55.0;I ordered the kettle as I thought it wouldn't have any plastic in the kettle - many mentioned that it doesn't have plastic. In fact, it DOES have plastic in the kettle holding the mesh. To avoid contact to the plastic, water level should be less than 50% of the whole kettle. Anyway, hot water will poured through the mesh making contacts to plastic. Also the water level indicator has two rubber holes upper and lower, and the level window looks like plastic too. Please take a look at the photos I noted for your information. I can say it has less plastic than others, but it is not accurate to say it doesn't have plastic.;It DOES have plastic in the kettle
87;14.0;1.0;72.0;This kettle stinks.  Even after many boilings, it fills the entire kitchen with a burnt rubbery smell, the unit stinks, and the water tastes bad.  We're returning it for that reason. Sadly, it fills easily, and it's not bad-looking on the counter, but the stench is a shock.  Yes, it's made of stainless steel, but so what?  The tea and coffee we made from it (and yes, we have coffee machines for the real thing, too) tastes dreadful.\n\nDo not be fooled by the good reviews and the attractive design.;It Stinks
71;15.0;1.0;67.0;yep, it looks great, has a really cool plug design, heats quickly, makes a nice 'ding' noise when it reaches the boiling point and reliably shuts off immediately after that- but the plastic smell and the taint it puts into the water make it useful only for boiling water that you use for....something other than drinks you can taste.;stinky!
90;16.0;3.0;62.0;Despite a couple of reviews above suggesting that this kettle imparts water with a bad odor, I took a chance.  Indeed, there's a foul, plastic odor which the Breville rep. I got on the phone referred to as manufacturing residue.  Apparently they know about this issue, and advised me to fill the kettle half full of 5% vinegar, top with water, and boil.  Well, after one cycle of this, 2 scrubbings with mild dish soap mixture and about 5 more boil-and-discard cycles, it is getting better.  Still, this should be a heads-up to anyone considering this product or deciding to buy it.  I don't think it's a permanent condition, but who really wants to drink manufacturing residue tea?;Looks, Works Great.  Smells Bad.
6;17.0;1.0;14.0;Review submitted next day after purchase:\n\nAs funny it may sound, but it is very hard to find quality kettle. Based on user reviews, and my personal experience with 3 different kettles, I can say that Glass kettles explode, Stainless kettles rust, plastic kettles have that poisonous  chemical substance in them. Well, this one is fine so far. It just boils water, and does not immediately rust as OXO junk, does not explode like Hamilton, and does not have 20 useless buttons and LCDs... I am having it for a week, and so far no problem, and I am very happy with my selection. The only cons - it is pricey for china-made product.\n\nUpdate 08/16/1016\n\nI have changed my rating to 1 star. The kettle has rusted inside after 3 weeks of usage. DO NOT BUY IT!!!;Rusty junk!

It has a great weight to it and everything feels well made (this coming from someone who hopes to be designing products for the rest of her life).  It's quiet and boils water quickly.  The ""ding"" when it's done is a little quiet so I often forget I've been boiling water, but I'm sure that if it were louder, I'd complain as such.

4;22.0;1.0;5.0;I really wanted to like this kettle, because we have an 8 year old version that we really like, but this one is junk.  Here's why:\n\n1. The kettle does not sit flat on the base, but rocks back and forth.  This is because they changed the base from our old model. See these photos for difference.\n\n2. When I spoke with Breville about this, they said it was fine, but its not, because it rattles and is unstable. Even though it is still under warranty and was used once, they refused to take it back.;GARBAGE
97;23.0;5.0;52.0;I received this tea kettle as a replacement for a Nova teakettle (the former model) that I purchased in October 2005.\n\nPart of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it, and Breville is excellent in this area.  My former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch.  I notified the company by email, and I received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail.  In 3 more hours, I received an email with a fed-x label.  They indicated they wanted to see the product, and they would either repair or replace it.  Within a week, I had this new model as a replacement, since they no longer make the Nova.\n\nI then received a follow up phone call from Breville to make sure I got and liked the new product, which I do.  The warranty period for the new product starts again, so it has a full one year warranty.  I also asked about the switch, since I was concerned that this could be a problem, and they assured me that this is a problem they just don't have with the applicances.  The customer service rep indicated that in 10 years, he had seen about 6 of the type of problem I had.  It seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company.\n\nThe new kettle heats quickly and to a full boil.  It also has the sharp looks where you can use for entertaining.  I am happy with the product, and very happy with the company's service.;Excellent kettle, Excellent company

17;25.0;5.0;22.0;"I love this kettle, functionally and esthetically.  Ours worked for many years then gradually began to become finicky about how it was positioned.  For a while the answer was just to rotate it on its base until it came back on, but gradually the sweet spots faded into nothing.  In between there was increasing flickering and annoyance.  Several times along the way I tried spraying contact cleaner and spinning it around a lot to clean it, with absolutely no effect.\n\nI read a lot of these reviews and saw that many experienced this, surprisingly few tried to fix it and seemingly everybody who tried succeeded.  It couldn't be that hard!  Inspired by their success, I dug in myself and easily fixed it.  You can, too!  I'm hoping to help you if you have the same problem by giving you far more detail than any of the accounts I read:\n\nTools needed:  Almost anything will do.  I succeeded with the first three items I grabbed, fingernail clippers, stapler and letter opener.  All three, it turns out, were more than capable of imposing their will on a thin piece of metal or rubber.\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words.  I found that reality is worth a thousand pictures.  If you can see it clearly you can solve it easily.  Here's how/what to see:\n\nOn the bottom of the kettle there are three metal parts near the center:\n\n1.  The center pin, what I was effectively cleaning.  It probably has no purpose other than positioning.  No wonder cleaning didn't help!\n\n2-3.  Two flimsy contacts.  This is surely where the problem lies.  Note that they are not symmetrical.  One, closer to the pin, pushes inward toward something in the base, while the other pushes outward.  They are held in place by some hard plastic framing.\n\nThe bottom of the base is more inscrutable.  It looks like a hard piece of plastic with a hole in the center, surrounded by a soft, loose rubber ring, surrounded by a hard ring that spreads out at the bottom into a much bigger circle and seems to be structural.  The trick is to use two thin tools (movable squeezing thingy on fingernail clippers and point of letter opener are nice choices) to push directly down on opposite sides of the inner rubber ring.  It turns out to be spring-loaded and willing to retract by about 3/4 inch.  If you push it all the way down (perhaps running into a snag halfway which disappears when it is level), it will reveal two concentric, circular metal sleeves facing each other across an airspace normally filled by the rubber ring.\n\nAs soon as you see this, pretty much everything becomes self-evident.  The pin and various round protrusions and holes all line up to give it that smooth rotation that we all love.  The plastic framing pushes the rubber ring in.  One of the contacts pushes against one of the rings, and the other against the other.  The problem is that they aren't pushing like they used to.\n\nThe answer is to use gentle but insistent force to make them push a little more, the inner one inward and the outer one outward.  There are probably countless ways to accomplish this.  One person said to turn the kettle upside down and push straight down on a contact, bending it more.  This is where the stapler came in handy.  I was very doubtful that it was doing much in the sideways direction, though, so I generally poked and prodded, finally forcing each contact all the way through to the opposite side of the plastic frame, then pushing it back (letter opener).  While I was at it, I sanded the contacts a little for good measure, in case they had rusted.\n\nI remember thinking that if I weren't too lazy to go downstairs and get a pair of needle-nosed pliers I could have done a much better job, but I plugged it back in, and it worked flawlessly, illustrating that mediocrity is sometimes good enough.  I'm guessing that the metal is strong enough to withstand this kind of operation many times.  I'm hoping it will work until I'm old and forgetful, and that one day when it becomes intermittent again I will look at reviews on Amazon, see this one, fix it again and either say hi to my earlier self or maybe not realize that it was me.  In case that happens, a suggestion to future me:  You might also want to use contact cleaner (in the right place this time), and/or sand the inner rings; I don't know.\n\nHere's the motivational pitch:  It will take you very little time.  It's already broken, so you have nothing to lose.  Especially if you're not normally a fix-it person, it may impress your spouse.  And there's something surprisingly satisfying about rescuing a beloved old mechanical friend from premature consignment to the appliance graveyard.\n\nI hope enough people mark this as useful to float it to the top of the list so others see it and can benefit as I did.";How to fix when it starts to short out and requires increasingly careful positioning on the base

45;27.0;1.0;28.0;I bought this kettle originally because the top opened up wide enough to clean, the kettle detached from the base, and I prefer metal over plastic. And it has a cute blue light when it's on. So far so good.\n\nWe had to send back two of them because when we got them they didn't work.\n\nWe've now had it for a year or two. It's become a bit of a game to figure out exactly how to rotate/position the kettle on the base so it stays on/heating. It's been getting worse - a few months ago I thought I was just getting forgetful and not turning it on after filling it. Then I saw the light go out just after turning it on, the motion of the water sloshing around (I guess) breaking the connection. Now it's very difficult to find a position that works, and the slightest touch turns it back off again.\n\nIt's also a bit slower to heat water than my last kettle (which is no longer available) but not as slow as the kettle we have at work.\n\nMy guess is that the induction connection in the base is just poorly designed. Anyways, guess we'll be buying a new (different) kettle.\n\nOh yeah, it does get pretty hot.;Nice look, bad quality
63;28.0;1.0;30.0;I bought it, and it started failing apart after a few months of moderate use. First, its light began to blink sporadically. Then the light quit working. Then the auto-shutdown system quit working - it would boil the water indefinitely, until I turn it off. Finally, it shortened my kitchen. At this point, I considered it simply dangerous, and sent it to the garbage can.;Failed after 6 months
85;29.0;2.0;29.0;I loved the look of this item and the sleek features that are included.  However, the burnt plastic smell is overwhelming and does not go away.  I bought this item and could not stand the taste of my tea so I brought it back thinking I got a bum one.  I exchanged it for an identical new one and was hopeful that perhaps it was just a fluke.  Unfortunately, I experienced the same problem again and after many washings and still the lingering taste and smell of burnt plastic, I am going to return this one too and try a new brand all together.;Great look, horrible smell
13;30.0;1.0;14.0;"My too long review begins!\n\nI didn't use this electric kettle. I got to the point wherein I opened the top flap on the box and read 'This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm."" No thanks, Breville. No thanks.\n\n[In terms of the 'chemical smell' people experience, I don't think this has to do with the plastic parts of the kettle.\n\nIt seems to be the water, and not the kettle, in every case I examined. To explain, I'll say that tap water generally has chemicals in it (disinfectants, etc; |water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants|). What does this have to do with the smell people experience? These kettles heat water fast. They bring it to a boil faster than traditional kettles, which is the point. The byproduct of boiling at such blazing speed is that all of the chemicals in the water are converted to gas equally as fast. This may be where people are having an unaccustomed reaction. With traditional kettles, or even boiling water in a microwave, the time it takes for the chemicals in tap water to convert to gas also allows for the byproduct smell to dissipate. An easy test for this would be to use purified water in the process a couple times and see if the smell is present sans chemicals. However, I'll also point out that tea is best served with fresh water (tap, stream, whatever) and not bottled water. When water doesn't have oxygen in it (as in bottled water), tea suffers. Thought I'd throw that out there before other people mentioned it. At any rate, just thought I'd share my thoughts. I think the 'chemical smell' thing I see on every electric kettle on amazon (regardless of what they're made of; glass, metal, plastic, etc) is actually just the chemicals in the water being converted to gas in a way most people haven't previously experienced. On this particular product, the smell is probably worse because of the soft-top steam sealing design. In essence, Breville is trapping it inside. /rant]\n\nSo why did I return it, if the smell people complain about in reviews is the water they're using, and not the smell of plastic burning from boiling water, inside the kettle? Because of plastic pseudo estrogens, and other nasty chemical elements used in the production of plastics. BPA is the most infamous, but not necessarily the most harmful or widely used. The issue is, though, that you won't 'smell' BPA, or any other pseudo estrogen. Not that leech from this product into your water for tea, or in the plastic cup of lemonade you leave out in the sun while mowing the lawn. You won't taste the pseudo estrogens and other harmful chemicals, either. Just because you can't smell or taste a poison doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Ask anyone who dealt with asbestos or had radon gas exposure.\n\nI did call Breville, and asked if BPA were present in the product, and they said no. They claimed the warning about cancer causing chemicals was because they didn't opt-in for testing and certification, and no other reason; essentially that they had to legally put the warning there because they didn't test.\n\nWhat I cannot understand, is why on a very high end and high priced product plastics would have to be used at all. There doesn't seem to be any context wherein plastics are actually needed.\n\nSo what am I going to do? I've already got a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uniware-Pyrex-Heat-resistant-Glass-Kettle-Tea-Pot-800ml-NEW/dp/B004MH2Q8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uniware Pyrex Heat resistant Glass Kettle Tea Pot 800ml NEW!</a>in my shopping cart, waiting for the refund to go through on this.

11;31.0;2.0;11.0;I ordered this kettlen last December 2014 with a one year warantee.\n\nEverything about this product is ok EXCEPT the plastic handle/casing part. This is all one piece which provides the handle and encircles the on/off button at the bottom of the unit. This on/off button is a simple press at the bottom half to turn on. After less than 4 months use this plastic casing surrounding the on/off button cracked at the bottom, then fell off, leaving the on/off button with no casing support. Without support, it was just a matter of a few pushes to see the entire switch push inward and downward into the lining of the kettle, making it impossible to operate.\nOK, must have been a fluke I thought. I contacted Breville and they sent me another kettle. I have only used this kettle about 3 months and guess what? The same thing happened--the plastic casing surrounding the on/off switch has cracked at the bottom and part of it has flaked off.\nI am going to tape the switch to the unit to avoid what happened on my first kettle. Wish me luck.\nI contacted Breville and I have till this December to decide whether I want to have yet another new kettle replacement. But I think there is a design flaw here and until Breville beefs up this plastic handle/casing part, I think I will pass and buy elsewhere because evidently my pushing technique is too strong? Please....\nI;I ordered this kettlen last December 2014 with a one ...

Then I called Breville customer service to get it replaced. Before you buy this product, you might want to call them just to give yourself an idea of how bad the customer service is. The average wait time I experienced was around 20-30 minutes per call. I was asked to send in proof of purchase (for something purchased a year ago!) along with a batch code. I sent that in via email, then never got a reply. I re-sent the info a week later, and never got a reply. Then I spent another 30 minutes on the call to follow up on the two emails they never answered. After that long call I was told they would not replace the kettle, but would offer me a ""substantial"" discount of 20% on a new kettle. In other words, I can buy from them at the same price I bought from Amazon, for a kettle that breaks after a year! Don't buy this kettle unless you plan to buy a new one every year.

81;34.0;3.0;26.0;I have a few Breville products and have been very happy with them. This kettle looks great and heats water quickly, but the smell and taste are horrible.

It's been a couple of weeks now, and there is still a faint odor/smell, and I'm hoping it will completely disappear soon, but for at least the first week, the water was undrinkable.

The cover opens easily with the push of a button and raises itself *slowly*, so it doesn't fling condensation about.  Very nice!\n\n2.  The boiling cycle is, of course, interrupted when you remove the kettle from its base, but unlike most modern electric kettles, this one does not turn itself off, so it will resume heating the water when it's placed back on the base.  This isn't a ""con"", but it's something to be aware of.";Great kettle, one caveat
22;36.0;3.0;14.0;"I was, overall, happy with this kettle. It's true, if you are leaving the water sitting in it for longer then an hour, the water will acquire metallic taste. As some others have mentioned this is not an issue if you are always refilling fresh water. It boils quickly albeit somewhat louder then i'd like. It's on the heavy side, which i didn't mind. The stainless steel body is very finger print-prone. I decided to just live with it, as this was the best kettle i could find with the  minimum amount of plastic parts submerged in the water.\n\nWhy only three stars then? Because this kettle just died on me after two years.\nIt appears that the base/kettle circuit started shorting. The problem seems to be not in the base itself, but in the part of the kettle that attaches to the base (otherwise i'd try replacing the base) .

For a couple of days i was able to work around it by rotating the kettle on it's base to find the ""sweet spot"", but this method eventually failed as well.\n\nFor the price (and given a single year warranty) it's a very short-lived kettle and hardly worth the value. I'm going with a different brand for the replacement.";Lasted two years
38;37.0;3.0;16.0;I purchased this thing on Jan. 30, '07.  And like the reviewer on Apr. 03, '11, mine just quit working.  It started about 4 mos. ago with intermittent off times.  The answer was to slightly rotate it on it's base.  Obviously, it wasn't making good contact with the prongs in the middle.  So, in looking at the bottom thinking I was just going to unscrew it for a quick fix, I see screw types I've never encountered before.  Those Chinese tricksters have used proprietary screws with triangle shaped depressed openings in the heads!  But I found a screwdriver tip that will work: a 3/32 flat blade will wedge into the opening and back them out.  Pretty straight forward after that.  I'll say that the contacts in the center post of the base are very thin and were probably fatigued.  After straightening and putting a stronger curve in them, VOILA!  Hot water.  I've been alone for 11 years now, so there's just me making one espresso in the morning.  So this thing was getting below moderate use, I'd say.  So, I think my grade of 3 stars fits because the center contact needs to be beefed up considerably.  Design flaw.  Oh, well.  I hope I brought some hope to someone out there who might want to try this fix.  It's not difficult and will save a bit of money.  Hopefully, it'll last another 6 years.;Back to boiling again....HUZZAH!

I've used another one before, and knew I disliked the placement of the water level behind the handle so that it's hard to see what the level is -- very stupid design. But it seemed better than other ones anyway. After ordering it and using it for a while, I've noticed that the spout is glued on rather than welded on. This is unbelievably crappy, as anyone with any sense knows perfectly well. Gluing metal to metal is infantile rubbish; clearly metal should be welded, and they're selling this thing for eighty bucks, not eight. Totally unacceptable, total garbage. Every time you pour boiling water from this thing, the poisonous toxins from the adhesive are melting into the water. Anyone with a brain will have to look elsewhere, regardless of the convenience factor. If nobody is going to manufacture a decent quality electric kettle, let's just use a real kettle instead. It's not that hard after all.";Very disappointing, toxic and unprofessional construction
89;40.0;4.0;20.0;"I research things a lot before I buy anymore, we wanted an electric kettle because when we use traditional kettle on the gas stove top, it just seems to waste a lot of energy heating the air which slips by.  We also are familiar with the European use of these as my wife is from Poland and we have used these kettles whenever we visit her family there, they boil water FAST.  All the heat energy created by the appliance goes into heating the water so there is very little waste.\n\nSo we've had this Breville kettle for a few weeks now and for the most part it has really done great. It boils water in 7 minutes that the stove top takes 12 minutes for the same amount (almost full).  I was concerned that living at 4800 feet in Montana that the temperature wouldn't be hot enough to trip the kettle when it boils. The trip mechanism must rely on some other variable when it senses boiling water, cause it trips off fine.\n\nWe use the kettle for tea and when we make pasta. For pasta we fill the kettle and put half as much water in the pasta pot, they both boil at the same time and we have boiling pasta water ready in half the time. Real geenyuses we is.\n\nSo why 4 stars??? The ""Smell"" thing, as reported in previous reviews here, we had a bit of a bad odor & taste thing going with this. I'm sure it will dissipate with time but the people who make this should be able to figure a way to prevent this from occurring in the first place.\n\nSo there's my 2 cents, I could drone on about the style, quality & such but enough people have done that. In fact it's why we bought this, it seems every other electric kettle out there has issues with it (and I looked at a huge majority of them). The Breville is the only electric kettle to be rated exceedingly well by so many people with only a few minor gripes.\n\nKeep shopping if you want, I don't think you'll find a better product than this.\n\nPeace.";Shopped a lot, bought this.

The product is attractive; the instructions are nicely done (though there's not much to using a kettle!). Registering the product and opening an account at the [...] website was painless.\n\nThe main reason I bought an electric kettle was to have boiling water faster. Well I did a couple of experiments*.  Here are the results:\n\nBoil 1.7 Liters water:\n--- Breville (Exactly 7 minutes),\n--- Covered 2 qt Sauce Pan (7 minutes, 15 seconds)\n--- Tea Kettle (7 minutes, 30 seconds)\n\nBoil .5 liters water:\n--- Breville (145 seconds)\n--- Covered 2 qt Sauce Pan (150 seconds)\n--- Tea Kettle (155 seconds)\n\n*Breville time based on when the switch turned off. Tea Kettle based on full whistle. Sauce pan based on observed full rolling boil.  Sauce pan and Kettle started on cold burner.\n\nWhile the Breville was slightly faster than the old-fashioned competition, the differences are minimal. So now I'm wondering if this was worth the $70 price tag, or if any other electric kettle would do better. I doubt it, and I'll probably keep it, for two reasons: 1)the auto-off feature works and is worth quite a lot in terms of safety and convenience, 2) it looks pretty cool - a totally stupid reason but something I'm nonetheless prone to take into consideration.\n\nA note on the retail box - on the back of the box, it says a half-liter of water takes ""less than a minute"" to boil. On the side of the box, it says a half liter of water takes 130 seconds to boil (that's 2 minutes, 10 seconds by my math, and it took 145 seconds in my test).\n\nI bought this so I could boil water faster to start brewing coffee in my new Chemex coffee pot, with beans ground in my new Capreso burr grinder.

There was a very slight manufacturing plastic smell in the beginning, but that quickly faded out UNLIKE the Capresso I was using before (noticeably strong plastic smell, even after two years of use!).  My only complaint is that the cut-off sensor lags a little.  I'd expect that once boiling is achieved, the kettle would shut off immediately.

The lid still works as designed (gradual swing opening after pressing the button), the light is still functional, and it boils water in about the same time as when new.  When I read the reviews of some people having problems, I was reticent.  But after seeing the kettle in action, I decided to buy it.\n\nRarely have I found a manufacturer that makes an appliance without problems in design or quality.  Capresso makes an excellent kettle, nearly perfect except for one fatal flaw: plastic.  There is a plastic gasket around the base of the heating element that insulates it from the glass.  This material has a very strong smell to it.  Take a look at a Capresso on display in a store.  Lift up the lid and take a whiff--you'll be ASTOUNDED at the intensity of the smell.  After owning one for two years, the smell may have dissipated but it is still there.  I eventually decided that I'd had enough and sought out a replacement kettle.  This led me to the Breville.\n\nThere were 2 main considerations for me with this product:  1) Heating time (it should be reasonable) and 2) minimal plastic exposure to water.  I timed the operation of this kettle and it is slightly longer than the Capresso, not enough to be significant.  The Breville is mostly stainless steel.  The only plastic that comes into contact with the water are two very small gaskets that allow water in to the gauge.  There is a plastic disk in the lid, but it is not in contact with the water.  There is a slight smell you get initially, which is a byproduct of manufacturing, but this fades in short order.\n\n* This kettle is very solid, and well made.  It is heavier than most other kettles, but this shouldn't be a problem for the average person (if you are frail or have a weak wrist, you might want to consider another kettle).\n\n* The lid has a clear plastic disk that becomes coated in condensation during use (so you can't really see into the kettle).  This isn't intended to check the water level--you have a gauge on the side for that.  It's really more to let you know the heating progress, as the condensation increases as the water approaches boiling.\n\n* The handle is big and solid, with a non-slip rubberized coating, so it's easy to handle.\n\n* The spout is well designed and pours evenly without dripping under normal use.\n\n* There is a metal filter near the spout that helps trap any particles that may have gotten into the kettle.  It is easy to remove and clean.\n\n* The water level gauge lights up when in use and is a little difficult to read.  The handle being directly in the line of sight poses a slight challenge, but not enough to prevent you from seeing the level.\n\n* There is a sensor that will shut off the kettle when the water comes to a boil.  It is a little slow to kick off if the water level is low, but it at least works.  And it will turn the kettle off if it detects no water inside.\n\n* The switch has a bell sound inside it that dings when the kettle goes off.  It is not very loud, but makes enough of a sound that you'll know the water is ready if you're not too far away.\n\n* The plug is 3 prong, which is unusual--most of these kettles have a 2 prong plug.  But Breville did this for safety, as the unit is grounded.  The plug also has an ingenious design that makes it easy to pull out with one finger.\n\n* The kettle does not have any special insulation, and will get very hot on the outside.  It takes a while for it to cool off, as it is made of metal (my glass Capresso cools off rather quickly).  If you have curious children in your home, keep the kettle away from counter edges or at least put cold water in the kettle after using to cool it off.\n\nGenerally, I have to say that I'm happy with this kettle and find it reasonably priced.  I was able to buy mine at BB&B for a little less than here by using a 20% off coupon.  The reason I went that route was to have an easy means of return if I found a problem or decided I didn't like it, so I'd not have to deal with the hassle of packing the thing up and shipping back to Amazon.  Still, it is very nicely priced here and from what I've heard Amazon customer service is very good.";One of the BEST choices on the market
18;51.0;4.0;8.0;It is my considered opinion that they don't make electric kettles like they used to. When I was a kid in England - a country where electric kettles are much more widely used than they are in the US - kettles used to last a very long time. They were the sort of things that were given as wedding gifts and which were expected to last half a lifetime. Of course, they were simpler then, with no fancy gizmos to go wrong, and definitely no plastic, but they were very reliable and functional. Not any more!\n\nI have recently suffered through a succession of kettles from well-known manufacturers that have had ridiculously short lives, sometimes as short as three months. Consequently, I decided to go to the higher price range represented by the Breville Ikon (I also liked its styling) and for the first fourteen months the kettle performed really well.\n\nThen suddenly - and I was not entirely surprised - it started to malfunction. It became difficult to find a location on the base where the light would stay on. The kettle had to be rotated and jostled to find another spot where contact was made, and the problem got so bad that as many as half-a-dozen repositionings and tweakings were eventually needed just to make a cup of tea.\nSeveral of the one-star reviews from a couple of years ago mentioned the same problem, so I thought that Breville must be aware of and have a solution to the problem.  So I contacted Breville in California through their web site email facility, and I have been agreeably surprised that their response has been so positive, even though the warranty had expired.\n\nBreville agreed that the kettle should have lasted longer, and I was told (within one business day of my email) that if I sent a copy of the receipt and the four-digit number engraved on the bottom of the kettle they would send a prepaid Fedex return authorization, and that they would then send a replacement. So I printed out a receipt from my Amazon account and returned the old kettle as they asked - in return they sent email notification that the replacement had been shipped (with tracking number), all within a week of my initial contact with Breville. I call that really good coast-to-coast customer service.\n\nNow that the functioning replacement kettle is on hand (it is a new one, and not some reconditioned clunker) it remains to be seen if it holds up to daily use for a reasonable length of time, which I would define as many years of reliable service.  So, I give four-stars for the 14 months of good service and for the excellent customer service, and I hope I don't need to update this review;Good Kettle, Better Customer Service.
65;52.0;1.0;14.0;This kettle does not last. It literally melted after being used for 9 months. I returned it to Williams Sonoma who has an awesome customer service department. I wish I could say the same for Breviille, who are rude and non supportive. WS sent a new kettle out, and the same thing happened. Other reviewers have had the same trouble. When the replacement melts, I will be looking for another company. IMO their products have become substandard all across the board. Sorry to say.;No no no.
74;53.0;2.0;14.0;Although I read many of the reviews posted here, I threw caution to the wind and bought this product because of its looks. Silly me. As others have mentioned, it is noisy, the measuring glass is very difficult to read, it takes much longer to boil water than the maker claims, and, the BAD SMELL.  After returning this kettle, I took some good advice from these reviews and bought an Aroma kettle from Target and I am very pleased.  Don't be seduced by the elegant appearance as I was.  Steer clear of this over-hyped and over-priced product.;Not Worth The Price And Disappointment
59;54.0;2.0;12.0;I bought this kettle to replace my 10+ year old kettle, which had problems with its power cable. I liked the design of the Breville and the stationary base concept and believed in most reviews saying that this is a stainless steel kettle. However, it is not.\n\nThe entire lid is pure plastic and there are other plastic components inside the container (including the slick-idea blue LED holder), which invariably will give you plastic leaching and organic trace compounds for many months to years.\n\nWhat made me return this kettle for a refund, however, was not just the plastic, but also the fact that the stainless steel bottom developed significant spots after the very first load of water, one of which was dark and would have developed a rust pit rather quickly.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the lid mechanism only worked every other or third time (you push a button to pop the lid open). This mechanism cannot be disabled or worked-around. I tried many times to see if it gets better after many moves, but it didn't.\n\nAll in all a very disappointing implementation and craftsmanship. I fixed the cable of my old, truly all-stainless kettle and will continue to plug/unplug it every time. At least I know that works...;Nice design, poor concept
75;55.0;5.0;13.0;"Have used this kettle daily for two weeks.  I think it's great.  It is meant to boil water easily, and it does this perfectly:  simple to fill, quick to boil, easy to pour, easy to clean, shuts off automatically.  It is a sturdy piece of equipment and has a great look and feel.  I compared it to all similar items at amazon, and I'm glad that I bought this one.\n\nIt can be filled with one hand; the lid opens automatically.  The spout is big, but not so big that too much heat gets lost during boil.  It is easy to tell when the unit is on - the whole water gauge lights up brightly.  There is hardly any plastic that comes into contact with boiling water, none at all if you fill to less than full capacity.\n\nHere are the minor drawbacks (I don't consider any of these truly significant).  The ""ding"" that signals a completed cycle is nice but almost inaudible.  I don't find that this matters though, because you can easily tell if the unit is on or off just by looking, and you know when a pot of water is about to boil when the loud rumbling goes away.  It shuts off automatically anyway, so a bell is not all that necessary.  The pot is not insulated, so yes, the metal does get very hot.  Only a problem if you have kids - no more dangerous than many other items in the kitchen.\n\nAs far as the bad smell/taste goes, I noticed it with the first 3 or 4 boils, then it went completely away.  Not a reason to avoid this item - just dump your first few pots.  Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers have used their purchases more than once before reviewing.";Great Product
24;56.0;1.0;7.0;Xmas, 2013 i have at bad cold and need a cuppa tea...the push button that opens up to let you pour the water in pops out along with spring.  Plastic parts seem to have broken.  But if you put them in place, the button will still open the lid.  But ALAS the water boils fine but it does not turn off when boiling as its designed to do,  Safety hazard, i would say. So i say, built in obsolence...and No to Breville products.;4 years too short at time to last
36;57.0;2.0;9.0;My Breville kettle shorted out after a year or so and I am unable to fix it.  I believe that others have had this problem.;shorted out
39;58.0;1.0;9.0;I purchased this kettle in the last year, and now the contacts between the kettle and base have failed and do not stay connected when the kettle is powered on. I contacted Breville, and because I did not have my receipt they asked me the batch number on the unit. I provided it, and I was told this number showed when the kettle was manufactured and that it was manufactured 3 years ago. Although the item could have been sold (to me) far later than the manufacturing date, Breville is using this manufacturing date as a reason to deny the 1 year warranty agreement.\n\nDon't be fooled by the sleek design and name. Breville is apparently not interested in standing behind it's products any longer. This kettle is entirely too expensive to last for such a short time.;Planned Obsolescence?

94;61.0;4.0;12.0;This kettle boils water faster than any we've ever owned.  It's well-designed, sturdy and attractive. Don't let the following remarks put you off.  We love this kettle, but we must offer these cautions.  First it is heavy when it is filled, so you might need two hands to move it if you are filling it at the sink.  However its weight and design make it very stable on the counter.  Also, be sure not to let your fingers stray from the handle to the metal after the water has boiled. I found out quickly how hot the pot got.  Keep it out of the reach of children too.\n\nThe handle is strong and easy to grip.  The pot pours beautifully.  It is just not for anyone who is frail or shaky.;One Great Kettle
96;62.0;5.0;12.0;I love this kettle! Seems the other reviewers have covered the reasons why. I will say that this kettle was a replacement for an older model whose lid broke. I contacted Breville about the broken lid, and had a replacement within 10 days. Now, that is great service!;love it!
29;63.0;1.0;7.0;"We purchased this Breville electric kettle a few years ago and it was great while it worked. Heats up fast. Turns itself off and a bell dings when it boils. Unfortunately, things began breaking down. First, the light went out. Not a big deal since it wasn't necessary for the overall function. Then, we'd flip the switch to the ""on"" position and nothing would happen at all unless we removed the pot from the base and repositioned it. This was very inconvenient and annoying, because you had to listen to hear whether or not the pot had ""kicked on,"" so we called Breville support and they kindly sent us a new base. That worked for a couple of weeks and then the same problem was back. This time when we called, Breville was not so supportive. So now we have a lovely stainless steel pot that really can only function as a pricey flower vase! For the price we paid, I would expect better quality. Too bad few things are meant to last more than a few years anymore!";Nice while it worked!
47;64.0;2.0;9.0;I bought this kettle about a year ago. Loved it so much I bought one for my daughter.  First the light stopped working (no big deal), then it started leaking a little bit, now it won't start unless I move it around on the base. I did register it at Breville on line when I got it so I'm hoping for a replacement, but after looking at the reviews on their website I'm not sure I'll get one.;Didn't Last
48;65.0;2.0;9.0;We received this item as a wedding gift. It looks very nice and we enjoyed using it. However after 12 months now (warranty is only 12 months as well) the electrical contact at the base of the kettle no longer makes a connection. So the power will not turn on unless we PRESS the kettle into the connection and hold it there. I have read the other reviews and this seems to be a common problem. I would not recommend purchasing this kettle for long term use.;Failed after 12 months
79;66.0;2.0;10.0;It is a great looking kettle but it stopped working in less than a year. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a triangular screwdriver to fix it.  Breville designers put a lof of effort designing the screws that can only be removed by the manufacturer.;Lasted for almost one year
46;67.0;1.0;8.0;A nice looking pricey kettle but it has a problematic heating base.  Shortly after about a year of use the base's electrical connector stopped functioning making the unit useless as it wouldn't heat the water.  The warranty is only good for a year so Breville would not replace or repair.  When I contacted Breville they offered me a discount if I wanted to purchase the same kettle but who wants to spend more money on the same kettle after such poor performance.;Kettle lasted just over a year and died

34;69.0;1.0;7.0;Like some other reviewers have found - this kettle's heating connection wears out.  I purchased my Ikon corless first kettle about 3 years ago and it gave out after about 18 months.

53;72.0;4.0;8.0;I've had a chance to use the kettle a few times, so I'll offer my first impressions.  I've used a cordless kettle practically every day for the past several years.  This is the 3rd kettle I've bought after wearing out two others.  The kettle is mostly stainless steel.  The handle, water level meter, lid, and scale filter receiver are mostly plastic.  The water level meter and filter receiver does come into contact with the water during boiling, but I have noticed no strange smells or tastes with the boiled water.  The kettle fits snugly, but well into the receiver.  The receiver seems to have a good design with some strong and weak points. Excess cord wraps up inside the receiver and stays there. This is a typical feature of cordless kettles and this one seems to work better than most.  The receiver has three rubber tipped legs which grip the counter well to keep it in place.  In the center is the electrical connection to the kettle which appears to be well shielded to keep water from entering the areas which contain the electrics and electronics.  However, the plastic interlock switches appear to be a bit flimsy.  This has been a point of failure on one other kettle I've owned. Time will tell with this one.  I don't really like the lid design. You push a button and the lid opens slowly. I suppose some people might be impressed with this, but the mechanism is just another point of potential failure. I would have preferred a more utilitarian lid, but it does work well for now so time will tell with this too.  You can fill and empty the kettle through the spout, so you really don't have to open the lid other than for cleaning.  The water level meter has a little hole at the bottom and top which fills a small chamber.  Because of this design, the kettle shouldn't be used for anything other than water because there's no practical way to clean inside this chamber.  I would have preferred a glass window on the side as it would be nice to use the kettle to heat up broth.  The chamber does light up when the kettle is in use which makes it easier to read, but this is a fairly useless feature as you really need to set the water to the right level before you turn it on.  It does provide a positive indication that the kettle is in use.  The on switch is located underneath the water level meter and it's a simple toggle switch which appears to be relatively heavy duty, which I like.  The scale filter is located behind the spout, and with the lid open is very easy to remove and clean.  This is a nice feature as they do need to be cleaned of sediment from time to time and in most other designs they are harder to remove and reinstall.  All in all I have to say I like this kettle and would probably buy it again, despite parts of the design that I don't like.;Not what I would call perfect, but a very good kettle
56;73.0;3.0;8.0;I boil water up to 15 times per day...and I bought this one because it is elegant and stainless steel.  It boils quickly and I love the bell ding in the morning...my mind knows...here comes coffee!\nI am buying another one today, because after almost four years of continuous use, my current Breville is going to be retired.  It still works, but there are some things that stopped working.\nWithin one year the soft-open lid stopped working softly.  It just pops open now.  Not a problem but I was sorry it quit so early in the game.\nSecondly, the light that comes on to indicate the kettle is on stopped working within the second year. The light is great so you can see how much water is in the kettle very easily.\nNow in its fourth year I have to boil a full pot of water or it won't come on.  I think the sensor must be corroded.\nOverall this is the best kettle I have ever used...and I will continue to use electric kettles.  The cordless feature is fantastic.  When it's full of water is is VERY heavy, so beware if you have any issues with lifting with one hand.\n\nUPDATE 3/2016\nI love this kettle. It just broke where you have to push the ON button...it's cracking all the way up the plastic. I'm so disappointed!!! Considering my last Breville lasted almost seven years!!!  This latest one was a little bit different design and seemed lighter. I am going to check if there is a warranty and get it replaced. I will keep you updated.\n\nUpdate 9/2017\nI wasn't able to figure out the warranty I thought I purchased. I contacted Amazon and they weren't helpful. So time has passed and I haven't yet purchased a new kettle. The model that started to break is still working: the on button completely cracked and fell out of kettle, the lid open button sticks if you push it too hard and the lid won't close (so we've figured a way to tap it gently or pry up with a thumbtack), the plastic casing around the water view window fell off. However, the kettle still boils water perfectly and dings! I tried three other makes of kettle in the forty dollar range and the water wouldn't boil long enough. Tea would taste like bleach water. So I'm still using my delapitated old Breville kettle. Probably till it dies or I get a shock from having to stick my finger in the hole to turn on kettle! \n\nUpdate 1/2018\nI can't believe I'm considering buying this again!!! The second one I bought is still working but looks awful, it's fallen apart but still boils water to the temperature I need to make the perfect cup of tea. Anyway, I've tried other kettles and the water tastes like bleach so I always go back to my old Breville. Maybe the third one will be the charm!;Broke within a few months..... but I'm still using it.
21;74.0;3.0;5.0;"This kettle is sturdy, attractive, and efficient. It heats water quickly and is very easy to handle. The kettle is also reasonably easy to clean. We've used ours continuously for over three years, and are generally satisfied.\n\nNonetheless, prospective buyers should be aware of some design flaws that will likely disappoint. First, the pleasant ""ding"" signal stopped working within about two months. Second, the nice blue light illuminating the capacity indicator soon followed suit. Although the kettle turns itself off automatically most of the time, it no longer tells us when a cycle has finished; occasionally, it just keeps boiling and has to be turned off manually.\n\nOf particular concern to me is the plastic (probably BPA-containing) ""window"" on the top of the kettle as well as the other plastic components that come into contact with water. Despite using only filtered water in the kettle, the chamber and plastic/vinyl components accumulate mineral deposits that resist every product I've tried (baking soda, white vinegar). My most serious complaint involves the filter and filter fastener: By now, both pieces have deteriorated to the point of practically crumbling. The filter fastener hardly ""fastens"" the filter, as it has never fit securely in its mount: Both pieces just end up falling to the bottom of the chamber. I just ordered replacements and learned that the fastener is considered ""obsolete"" (somehow, I was lucky enough to get the very last fastener in the supplier's inventory).\n\nFor me, these design flaws overshadow this nice kettle's strong points. Once this one gives up the ghost, I'll only look for replacements that don't include parts made with BPA and whose internal parts are much more durable.";Durable and dependable, but ...

So the first time we used it my elderly mom was staying with us, she is used to picking a kettle up by the by the handle and supporting the weight with her other hand on the body of the kettle. She literally screamed out loud having scolded her hand. This unit has no insulation so the nice looking stainless body becomes scolding hot.\nAdd to that the visual indicator for fill level is half hidden behind the handle.\nI honestly have no idea how people have rated this so highly.;Dangerous around children and adults
0;76.0;4.0;9.0;This electric water heater feels very solid and well built. When filled to 1.7 liters, it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil. The kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished. I thought this would be annoying, but it is not! Also, when switched on, there is a nice white LED lighting up the water supply making it easy to read.\n\nMy only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) when it is on. A few moments after the switch is turned on, it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation.;Well built, but a little loud!
32;77.0;2.0;6.0;This kettle looks great and works great until it breaks. I have ordered a couple and the following problems happened after some time. The button for opening the lid stopped working after the firs six months. The automatic switch off took longer and longer to activate - the water will be boiling for minutes before the kettle is turned off. Eventually after about three years of use the kettle completely broke. As this appliance is pricey, it is my expectation that it should last longer than that.

42;83.0;2.0;6.0;"I have purchased this kettle (as you can see from ""verified purchase"" tag), twice, and while I enjoyed the great overall (very aesthetically-pleasing and user-friendly) design of this kettle I certainly did NOT enjoy the very short-lasting ""life"" these kettles seem to possess.

Both times the kettles itself lost the contact with the very flimsy metal elements (they wore down to an unrepairable (by me) state) in the ""base"" unit. The first sign of this imminent failure is that the kettle starts to require a slight ""rotation"" or ""turning"" once you place it on its ""base"" and turn it ""on"". Once that happens, you have a few weeks until the total failure. Surprisingly, a much cheaper and more ""ugly"" electric kettle of different brand (which we had as a ""spare"")is still going strong, with no failures of any kind, since 2003, which I guess proves again that nice-looking, ""expensive"" devices aren't really meant to last long when actually being used every day...";Good design, bad execution

Boils water superfast, easy to handle and view quantity of water with the lighted blue inidicator, and the ding when it's finished is a nice touch (most of my friends' electric kettles just shut off, but don't tell you they're ready). The dripless spout really is dripless, which I consider probably the best feature of all -- those of you familiar with a lot of other kettles know the experience if getting boiling water all over the place when you're trying to pour.\n\nHonestly, some the complaints are very odd. If you're stupid enough to put your hands on a hot metal kettle, then you probably shouldn't have one in the first place. The handle is more than adequately placed away from the stainless steel exterior to prevent burned fingers. The push button cover release also shouldn't cause anyone to have to touch the exterior.

When I first rinsed it out and boiled a pot of water, I thought I had found a great kettle. However, when I emptied the water and it air-dried I noticed small black spots on the bottom plate on the inside. I rinsed it out with diluted vinegar and tried it again, only for the same thing to happen with even more spots than before. I thought it was a defective product, so I returned it and bought another one. The same thing happened with the second one. I am still looking for a decent electric kettle!;Flawed product?
58;95.0;1.0;5.0;First the illuminated display started blinking. Next, I had to twist the kettle on the base to make the connection for the kettle to start working. Finally, I noticed a smell of electrical burning & found that the base connector was melting! All within 3 months of purchase! This is our 2nd Breville. The 1st lasted one year before failing. I believe the design of the base is flawed. The size of the electrical contacts is too small for the current necessary for that size heating element. I'm going to go back to the stove top variety & avoid providing more non-biodegradable fodder for landfill.;Failed Before 3 Months
60;96.0;3.0;5.0;I love how this kettle looks and it worked great for 2 years then it started taking longer and longer for it to switch off when it started boiling, then it kept blowing the sockets and they had to be reset.  Now it has just packed up altogether.  Warranty is only 1 year, so i guess i have to buy a new one.;Great kettle but broke after 2 years of use.
61;97.0;3.0;5.0;"Bought this kettle in 2006. Like others have said, it gets hot but it is a kettle so no problem. The real problem is it no longer shuts down once the water is boiling. It worked fine for about 6 months and then began to take longer and longer to shut down. At about one year it totally quit shutting down. I have never let it boil dry so I do not know what happens in this situation. Maybe there is a separate ""boil dry sensor"" which would turn it off in this potentially dangerous situation. It does look nice.";Worked fine for awhile
67;98.0;5.0;5.0;"We've had this kettle for almost 2 years now and could not be happier. It is a beautiful, very sturdy appliance, though like all stainless steel, the outside needs to be maintained properly. I can think of no faults with its design or function. We bought this to replace our old stove-top kettle and are glad we did. It is incredibly fast, so fast we even use it to boil water to cook large pots of pasta (obviously, we pour the water into a pot, it's a kettle, not a Hotpot).\n\nThe best features are probably the cordless design and the swivel base. It will work in any position on top of the base and is very convenient to move around, fill up, and pour out without the cord dragging from the kettle itself.\n\nThe water level indicator is behind the large handle but I've never had a problem reading it. I really don't use it that much except to make sure it's not overfilled when boiling large quantities of water. The ""cushion-controlled"" lid also still works perfectly and always opens with a push of the button and seals tight when pressed back down.\n\nI've never tested the boil-dry protection, and I don't ever want to, but the auto-off function always works, with the little 'ding' of the bell to tell you it is done.\n\nNow if only Breville made an auto-drip coffe machine to replace my now leaking 8 year old Krups ProAroma...";Beautiful Design, Flawless Operation
68;99.0;5.0;5.0;UPDATE 11/29/09: If you read my original review below, this will make more sense. I contacted Breville and they were very easy to deal with. They provided a shipping label so returning the defective kettle was easy. It took about 6 weeks to get the new kettle, which seemed inordinately long, but I have since used the kettle nearly every day and have never had another problem. I would now highly recommend! If yours has an issue, ask for a replacement!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I first saw this kettle at a friend's apartment, and was entirely wooed by the beautiful design.  As someone who drinks tea night and day, and is fussy about design and quality, I insisted on having it.  For the first few months I was ecstatic - great ease of use, stayed looking good, no stink like others have mentioned, and I loved the lighted meter - but then one morning it mysteriously died.  Totally dead.  No power outage, no problem with my surge protector, no fried circuts - just dead.  This is a pricey appliance from a good company but I had bad luck - what a bummer.;First one a lemon, second one a gem
70;100.0;3.0;5.0;"My wife hinted to me before Christmas that she would love to have an electric tea kettle, given how fast and convenient it would be anytime she needed a cup of tea or the kids some hot water for noodles.  I wasn't surprised by this notion as she is the daughter of a great gadget lover, my mother in law.  The latter has an electric can opener, electric knife sharpener, electric carving knife (which can't be sharpened on the electric sharpener, by the way) and even an electric pot scrubber.  There are others of course, but most have ceased to work and are hidden away in her closets.  I have none of the above and have been surviving just fine.  But it is Christmas after all, and many of my fuddy duddy thoughts usually go by the wayside at this time of the year anyway, so I searched Amazon and found the gaggle of pots that several manufactures offer and began reading reviews and making eliminations.  Plastic was out, as I don't like the idea of whatever silent killers creep out of petroleum products once they encounter sufficient heat.  I did read about how some stainless steel pot ""stinks"" as one very angry reviewer put it, but I really don't know why this would device would ""stink"" any more than my metal coffee mug ""stinks"" when I am drinking out of it, so I discounted that opinion as being borderline hysterical. I chose the Breville for completely superficial reasons--it looked good and the package offered a very sincere explanation about how the company was trying to make useful things for useful people.  I sort of liked that attitude and bought it.  After enjoying the very relieved expression on my wife's face when she unwrapped it (the previous present was some poorly considered exercise pants), I quickly gave our new Breville some prominence in our kitchen and awaited an opportunity to actually give it a go.  Finally after repeated calls for tea, I had a taker and we carefully read the instructions,  swirled and dumped some test water and put in our first batch of real water that would be consumed.  The switch was flipped and a very nice blue light went on.  Minutes went by and soon there was bubbling, gurgling and steam coming from its spout.  Upon reaching its very enthusiastic climax, a small bell went off and the whole unit shut itself off very proudly.  We were done!  I poured for tea and stood back to weigh the results.  It was tea!  And hot too!  Uh, but so it was when I made water from the tea-kettle heated by gas on the stove...time for an experiment that would have to be done when the wife was out shopping:  two cups of cold water poured into the Breville and two into our old tea kettle on the stove.  With the two hot water makers standing at the ready, a stop watch and the kids yelling ""Go"" to make it seem more exciting, we lit the burner and flipped the switch simultaneously.  I'll cut to the chase, as this is getting long:  Breville: 3 minutes 50 seconds to boil.  Tea Kettle:  4 minutes 55 seconds to boil.  Water Quality:  Both tasted like boiled water.  Maintenance:  Dump water out of both, refill as necessary.  Lifecycle:  Breville will eventually die like all good electrical products; teapot--will eventually be thrown out for no other reason than we are tired of looking at it or upon evidence of massive corrosion after 50 years of hard use.  Bottom line to consumers:  If you have unrealistic expectations about boiling water, the Breville product is perfect.  But otherwise, it is completely useless.  If you need hot water for your tea and own a stove, get a nice looking teapot and when someone asks you why you don't have an electric teapot, tell them that it has been scientifically proven that they produce no better hot water than the traditional method and may actually be harmful to the environment.  That ought to shut them up.";Perfect for Gadget Lovers

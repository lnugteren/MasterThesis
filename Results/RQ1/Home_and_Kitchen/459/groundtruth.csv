443;1.0;5.0;295.0;"I can't overemphasize this:  I've slept better on this matt topper than I have previously slept in my entire adult life.  A few years ago I invested in a very high-end 100% all-natural Talalay Latex mattress.  Anyone who has priced/purchased solid latex knows the stuff costs a small fortune.  I won't argue that latex is a marvel, and it will last more than a lifetime ... yet the comfort of that matt was NOTHING compared to this.  I can't believe I spent $1500 on a fancy latex mattress when I could have (should have, wish I would have) spent less than $100 on this topper.  This is such a whole-body relief that I would be happily willing to replace it every couple of years with a fresh one - although I don't expect to need to, since the quality is outstanding.  But if my dog chews it up or something, you can bet I'll be buying another one.  I imagine that this is as close to weightless sleep as is possible in Earth's gravity.  I could not be more delighted.  Superb price for a superb product.  If I had the storage space, I would buy a spare - that's how much I like this matt topper!  If I didn't own a mattress at all, I would buy two four-inch ones and sandwich them together.  Don't worry about odor - the ""new car"" smell dissipates in a couple of hours.  And don't worry about the myth that viscoelastic foam makes you hot - it doesn't.  Just put an all-cotton quilted mattress protector between you and it - you can buy 'em anywhere (such as on Amazon) for cheap.  This allows airflow between you and your topper, and I would never sleep on a matt without one, anyway.  Oh, one more thing - I'm a lightweight, but bought three inches rather than the recommended two inches.  Regardless of your weight, spend the tiny extra amount for 3"" - totally worth it!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.";Exceeded expectations 100% A+++
3;2.0;5.0;329.0;I read a few reviews on the 3.3 Cloud9 full sized memory foam mattress. I ordered it on Monday morning and it was delivered to my door Friday afternoon. That was so fast!\nI opened it and was surprised to feel how it felt as I used to have a full memory foam system and this topper felt not so memory-foamish...BUT..... when I opened the wrappers and the mattress had a few hrs to absorb the air in all the nooks & crannies the mattress plumped up and I had just as good a night's sleep as my former memory foam system. I highly recommend this product as the price was right! Just give the mattress topper time to plump up!  Sweet Dreams!;Worth every penny!

1;4.0;5.0;104.0;This did the trick on making a hard mattres comfortable. Here's a tip on how to trim the corners. I took a paper plate and used a sharpie to mark the radius in each corner and then took the electric carving knife from the kitchen and cut along the mark. Sweet!

429;10.0;3.0;29.0;"My mother lives in another state; I sent her this as a gift and while I cannot as of yet say how she likes the comfort level she did phone me with a concern not mentioned anywhere here. The package comes with a huge warning repeated a couple of times regarding the high flammability of this item as well as how toxic burning fumes from it would be. She read off quite a warning to me. Noting it was demanded that the warning be passed along to the consumer. When I purchase something online, I rely on all pertinent information ibe disclosed by the online seller. I think the degree of flammability is pertinent information.";Present for Mom
84;11.0;5.0;24.0;This topper came very nicely packed. It was shrunk wrapped to save space and to keep any moisture out during shipping. Upon opening there is the typical foam scent that will go away in the fluffing up process. I unrolled the mattress topper and let it sit for about 48 hours to get to the full width that it could reach.\nThis topper is amazing. I got it in exchange for my review.  I put it on top of my twin mattress in my sons room. I had been sleeping on just the mattress for months, with hip and neck pain. After a week of sleeping on this coushion-type topper, I don't have the pain anymore.\nBecause it's memory foam, you sink right in and it molds to your frame.\nThis is very comfortable and I'd highly recommend it!;Best nights sleep in years
416;12.0;1.0;23.0;"I love memory foam mattresses, and need them for a bad back.  The one I had before from Healthy Foundations.com which lasted 5 years before it started sagging and had to be replaced.  This one sags after just a couple months.  Do not buy it.  You will be disappointed.  Update: 6/7/13 after writing this review a new memory foam topper was sent to me free of charge, in exchange for old sagging one.  I will continue to update, to let people know if there is an improvement.  But since the first topper sagged after a couple months use, I will need to wait that long to see if 2nd topper is better. UPDATE 7/30/2013: REPLACEMENT TOPPER SAGS JUST AS BAD AS THE FIRST ONE, REACHING FOR THE ADVIL IN AM.  I WOULD RECOMMEND ""HEALTHY FOUNDATIONS.COM"" FOR A GOOD QUALITY 4 lbs/sq ft MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER THAT DOES NOT SAG AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS.  THAT'S WHAT I HAD BEFORE.  IT'S A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT FAR MORE WORTH IT, AS IT LASTS 5+ YEARS, AND HAS A 365 DAY RETURN WITH FULL REFUND POLICY.  [I ALSO TRIED A SUPER EXPENSIVE TEMPURPEDIC TOPPER ABOUT $700, BUT IT WAS WAY TOO HARD at 5.3 lbs/sq ft: WOKE UP POPPING THE ADVIL WITH COFFEE AGAIN. ""HEALTHY FOUNDATIONS.COM"" AT $300 IS THE BEST IN MY OPINION. YOU CAN THROW AWAY THE ADVIL BOTTLE FOR GOOD AND GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE. NOTE: Cloud 9 Refuses to disclose the ""lbs/sq ft"" as other companies do so you can compare sensibly since you are buying blind on line.  I'm guessing Cloud 9 is <1 lb/sq ft.  The higher lbs/sq ft (density) the longer it will last and is the best comfort in my opinion.]";This foam mattress SAGS after only a couple months use
10;13.0;5.0;17.0;"Talk about an unexpected experience.  This was crazy but did prove one thing.  Regardless of whether you like this topper, or don't like this topper, you can count on stellar customer service.  Listen to what happened to me.\n\nI'm almost 70 and have advanced degenerative disc disease which can be extremely painful when nerves get pinched.  Lately I've had a hard time getting a good night's sleep.  We couldn't afford to purchase a new bed so my husband, who ALWAYS puts me first, insisted I try this mattress topper.  We figured the thick memory foam might be just the right thing to cradle my spine.  Let me say right here that my husband also has serious back issues which are disabling but we could only afford one topper so he says...""we get one for your bed first"".  Enough back ground.\n\nThe topper arrived quickly and very well packed.  It was shrink wrapped so we opened the package very carefully, took out the topper and laid it over the couch.  Instructions on the OUTSIDE of the box tell you right UP front that you should let the topper lay out for 96 hours to fully plump up.  It also tells you to expect a ""new foam"" smell which will dissipate over time with suggestions to counter the smell if it bothers you.  I did see some  comments referring to a bad smell.  There was NO SMELL from day one.  I even stuck my face right in the foam and there was no objectionable odor.  Even though it only took a few hours for the topper to rise unevenly so you could get a good idea of what you had, it took about 3 days to fully and perfectly expand.  In the mean time I was really anxious to see how it was going to fit on my bed so my husband and I took it in and just laid it over the top of my bed to get an idea of how high it was going to be.  Low and behold, it looked like the topper was going to be too big.  OMG...how would I ever get this thing compressed again for a return?  Would they give me a problem?  Would I have to pay for return shipping.  This thing is BIG....lol.\n\nI sent the seller an e-mail explaining that, even though I purchased a ""full"" size topper for a ""full"" size bed, the topper looked like it was going to be too big.  NO PROBLEM AT ALL~!!!!!!  They sent me a reply withing 48 hours saying they would send me a box big enough to return the expanded mattress topper along with a pre-paid return shipping label AND THEY WOULD CUSTOM CUT A TOPPER TO FIT MY BED AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.  I was so relieved and so impressed.  Now that customer service that can't be beat.  So what happened next?\n\nHubby was thinking maybe he could just cut the foam topper down if it was only too big on one side so we stripped the bed down and laid the topper on the mattress.  Actually the topper only went over the edges of the bed a little bit all on all sides.  It's memory foam so maybe we should try making the bed and see what happens. First we put a brand new fitted mattress pad over the Cloud Topper and then made the bed with deep pocket fitted sheets.  Low and behold the mattress topper conformed to the size of the mattress and everything was just fine.  I was SO looking forward to sleeping on the bed that night.\n\nWhen I laid down it felt soft and cozy. I fell asleep quickly but only slept about 5 hours.  I did have a LOT of hip pain the next day but didn't associate it with the topper.  The second night I crawled into bed and laid there.  The hip pain started increasing and got worse minute by minute.  Finally I couldn't take it any more.  I woke my husband up and said we have to take this topper off the bed NOW.  I can't stand the pain.  We did.  Before we bought this topper I had a thinner mattress pad on my bed under a quilted mattress cover.  It was really late and I didn't feel like digging out the old bedding so I just put the mattress cover and sheets back on the bed and laid down.  Within half and hour most of the pain was gone.  It turns out I didn't need a mattress topper for my spine.  I needed a firmer surface which was the last thing I thought I needed.  If it hadn't been for this topper fiasco I might never had tried laying on a firmer surface.  So what happened to the topper?\n\nThe next day hubby says...""well before we send it back I'll try it on my bed"" so we put the topper on his bed.  I didn't expect any difference but GUESS WHAT???  The mattress topper worked fine for him.  He said it was VERY comfortable and he got a good night's sleep.  I sent the seller an e-mail explaining what was going on.  Got a reply reminding me we had time to try out.  Let them know if there was an further problems.  It's been three nights now and he thinks it's helping his back.\n\nYesterday I got a PHONE CALL.  Yes, that's right.  The seller called us to let me know they had sent out a return box with a shipping label if I needed it.  If we have a problem just let them know.  I'm amazed at the quality of service from these people.  Have NO fears about buying from them.  I think it worked out crazy but fantastic.  My husband got a much more comfortable bed that's giving him a good night's sleep and I'm sleeping much better on my bed now that I took the topper off and just make it with a quilted mattress cover and fitted sheets.  Who knew...lol.\n\nIf you're just looking for a great night's sleep and you want comfy cozy, try this topper.  It is excellent quality and made in the U.S.A. with materials manufactured in the U.S..  If you've got medical back issues...will this help your back?  You might want to ask your doctor what he thinks.  I'm the first to tell you, everyone is different and everyone has different back problems so you just have to get the best advice and then try it if you think this is the solution.";Excellent Quality and Superior Customer Service You Can Trust!!!
453;14.0;5.0;23.0;"The shipping was pretty fast, I received my order in 4 business days. I let it unfold out of the box for about 4 hours before I used it. It does have a smell, as all foam mattresses/toppers do, but it went away completely after about a week. For 2 weeks, I compared several similar foam mattress toppers (probably all of the ones on Amazon/Overstock) and read up on all the reviews before deciding on this one. The reason I chose this one was mainly because of the price and I wanted a 3"". This definitely makes a huge difference to my bed. It is very comfortable for me and it feels like I am sleeping on a tempurpedic. A lot of my friends have also commented on how comfortable my bed is. Overall, I am satisfied with this product and would order again! It really is like sleeping on a ""cloud"".";Makes me excited to go to bed!
353;15.0;4.0;21.0;"Bought and placed it over my regular spring mattress. The problem i'm having is that its too soft for me. I wake up many times at night because of this, I feel like my back is arched while in bed. I am not overly heavy either; 6'2, 185. I cant ship it back either because the thing came with the air sucked out of it in a smaller box so I would need to suck all the air out and seal it or get a huge box and pay shipping to return it.\n\nA month later -\n\nI enjoy this mattress topper, I still wake up throughout the night but I think that is just one of my problems. I fall asleep much quicker and this topper is genuinely comfortable. It just takes a while to get used to it. The first few weeks will be tough.";Soft at first, takes a few weeks to get use to
262;16.0;5.0;19.0;I totally recommend this product!!!! Never slept better. I had if for 3 days already and I can't wait to go to bed again. 100%satisfaction!!!;GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
456;17.0;5.0;21.0;I've had this on my bed for a few weeks now. It certainly is comfortable, and seems quite durable. It held up when I wedged it into my mattress cover, which required a lot of pulling and tugging. It's helped make my cheap Ikea mattress very comfortable.;Inexpensive, very comfortable, so far very durable.
93;18.0;5.0;15.0;The shipping was very fast! When it arrived I immediately unpacked and followed the directions to allow it to rest. I put it in a spare bedroom for 96 hours. I did notice the unpleasant odor but that is completely normal with any memory foam product. After 96 hours of resting and airing out the odor is almost completely gone. After the adjustment period I couldn't wait to try it out. I used it last night and had a wonderful night of rest. The memory foam immediately conforms to your body. It was extremely comfortable. I'm thinking about moving this topper out to my camper where I have a very uncomfortable mattress. This is a lot cheaper than buying a new mattress. I highly recommend this product for a comfortable and relaxing night's rest.;So comfortable!!
232;19.0;5.0;16.0;Received this in the mail 5 days ago and couldn't be happier with what I got, unless three strippers came out when I unrolled the thing.\n\nI have chronic back problems from a couple car wrecks, and I had only been getting four hours of sleep, on average. After putting this thing down, I can't help but sleep any time I make contact with my bed. It's like those sleep chambers on The Fifth Element, or something.\n\nIt sucks you in and forms perfectly around you. I had never been able to sleep on my back before this, and also, it's the first time I've ever gone to sleep in a position and woke up in that exact position the next day.\n\nThe only complaint I might have is that it can kinda slide a little and hang off the bed a bit. But here's the thing. That only bothers me on the sides. Because it hangs over a little, it actually made it almost like I have a longer mattress, so my feet no longer hang off the end. This damn thing is inadvertently solving problems I haven't even thought of.\n\nThe only thing I would advise before buying it is that if you have a pillow-top mattress that this is going on, buy an oversized fitted sheet. It just won't fit, otherwise.;Can't beat this thing for price.
2;20.0;4.0;20.0;The foam pad arrived promptly as promised.  I couldn't wait to make up the bed.\nI found the pad 4 inches too wide and 3 inches too long, so making up the bed was really hard.  I wonder if I got a queen size by mistake! What to do?\nNonetheless its very comfortable, and I'm getting used to slipping off the edge.;comfortable to sleep on, but.....

13;25.0;1.0;11.0;It has no cover, just a piece of foam, NOT MEMORY FOAM. Most importantly, it emitted an extremely pungent odor of something like formaldehyde that overtook the entire room and down the hallway. It gave me a horrible headache for 2 days. I tried airing room out. No go. It was so difficult to get back into the box that it came in that I cannot return. I layer it over the fence next to the garbage cans outside for almost a week. I went to cut it in half in order to fit it into the trash can an found that it had aired out the smell a little. I made a makeshift cover for it with 4 fitted sheets I no longer use so it was double covered and placed it UNDER my existing memory foam topper that was a bit to thin. Highly flammable with no warning tags. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FLOPPY PIECE OF CHEAP FOAM. I got even less than I paid for and more as it was a burdening pain in the butt to deal with. Just horrible.;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF FOAM!

The only reason why I did not give it all 5 stars is because it states in the description there is a 20 year warranty on this item. When it arrived at my house, there weren't any warranty papers in the box. There weren't any papers at all! My mother told me she went to the website and it gave instructions to allow 48 hrs for the item to ""air out"" Kudos for saving on paper use but I would like to know why there wasn't a warranty form.. I will admit before rating this item, I did not check my thousands of emails to see if there was something sent on it but if that is how it works, please indicate that in the item details since it does state 20 year warranty.";She says it's very comfortable and that she likes it a lot
49;31.0;5.0;10.0;This was my first time buying any type of memory foam mattress topper for my bed, so I was skeptical buying this product to begin with.  However after purchasing the the 3.3 Cloud9 I am more than pleased with the product.  It arrived to my doorstep a week before the expected delivery date and in perfect condition.  After taking it out of the box, it took some time for the foam to expand to its normal size and it gave off a polyurethane smell but both of these went away in no time at all.  Being an athlete and constantly working out and running around, this has done wonders for my back and neck in alleviating overall pain by taking a lot of pressure off my body as I sleep or lay down.  For the price this is set at, it should be a definite buy.;Definite Choice

435;34.0;5.0;12.0;My boyfriends bed was like sleeping on cardboard and I swear I woke up every hour. It was horrible. The first night we put our new Cloud9 memory foam topper, It was amazing and I finally started getting some sleep. It's not too firm or too soft, it feels like it hugs you. I am thankful I didn't have to spend 250+ dollars and found an affordable solution to a cardboard mattress!!! I recommend this to anyone who has the same challenge I did. =);I CAN FINALLY SLEEP!!
242;35.0;5.0;11.0;I was a little hesitant about giving five stars when I initially received my product. This was because the foam was so condensed from shipping. It expanded after a few days and I'm quite pleased with my purchase. It is heavenly to sleep on.;Great!
440;36.0;5.0;12.0;I've had back pain years, and my older, firm mattress hasn't been helping. I don't have the money to replace to my mattress with a higher quality one, so I decided to invest in a memory foam mattress pad that could fit my budget. I did some browsing on Amazon and, after comparing prices, product details, and customer reviews, settled on this one... I'm so glad I did! For the first time in years I slept without tossing and turning and, more importantly, had 10 hours of spectacularly uninterrupted sleep. Yes, as other reviewers have claimed, it isn't quite the right size for my mattress, but it isn't bothersome in the least. The corners stick out a little far, but I personally don't find it to be a problem. I can't wait to sleep again!!;Best sleep in YEARS!
117;37.0;5.0;10.0;I ordered this for my daughter & she absolutely loves it.  She has back issues due to a car accident & this topper definetly helps minimize her discomfort while sleeping. It arrived on time, properly packaged & had minimal odor. I was not sure how long it had to sit to swell to the appropriate height but my daughter was so excited to use it.....it only aired out for approx 4-5hours. But it seems that was enough time as it definetly doubled in height.  As a result of this positive experience I have since ordered a 2nd topper for our bed as my husband & I also have back issues. Please read all the comments regarding thickness before ordering as your weight factors into the thickness you may need. My 2nd order for my husband & myself was the 4inch.  Will comment on that when it arrives but I am sure it will also be a positive experience.;EXTREMELY PLEASED...LOVE IT!!
297;38.0;4.0;11.0;Soft and makes a hard bed much more comfortable.  Drawback is that it is hot.  We purchased this for Tennessee cabin and did the trick for comfort but I did notice I was considerably warmer than usual.  A quilted mattress pad would probably correct this.  We did not mind as we were from Florida and it kept us warm in the much cooler Tennessee temperature.  It suits the purpose we bought it for but others need to consider the extra heat from the bed.;Soft but generates heat

204;42.0;5.0;10.0;I bought this for my son's room, and received it yesterday.  It arrived about a week earlier than stated when I purchased it.  There was very little odor taking it out of the package, and I let it expand for about 3 hours before sleeping on it.  It was a little oversized for the mattress, but the mattress pad and sheets fit over it without a problem.  It is amazing what a difference this makes.  My son loved it, and slept through the night without tossing and turning.  I recommend this to anyone who has a mattress that is uncomfortable.;Turned the worst mattress in our house into the most comfortable
213;43.0;4.0;10.0;Surprised how quickly this came. We were a bit concerned when we took it out of the box and unfolded it. It was lumpy and creased, but we figured we would just lay it on the bed and hope it would flatten out. sure enough a couple hours later it was perfectly smooth. I got the mattress hoping it would help with my back pain. So far it has not. My husband and I both love the feel of sleeping on it and would recommend it to a friend.;memory foam mattress

217;45.0;5.0;10.0;My father was renting a home for a few months down south and he complained that he could barely sleep on the mattress that was in the house.  I sent this down to him, and he said it was like having a new bed instantly!  In fact, he asked me where I got it he wants one for home too.  It was worth the step up in price for the quality, no plastic smell and is breathable in warm weather.  Great product!;Made a huge difference
59;46.0;5.0;9.0;I was surprised when I first got this. It was all folded up in the package and had a strange smell. I wasn't sure I was going to keep it but I decided to give it a try and wasn't disappointed. The smell went away after a couple of days and it was fine when it settled. I like it because its a full sheet of foam and not pieces compacted together. I've really enjoyed sleeping on it and I've had no back/shoulder pain since using it. The only drawback at this point is its kind of an ugly yellow color but if you throw some sheets on over top of it you won't notice. Really good product and absolutely reasonable price.;Like it
243;47.0;4.0;10.0;I really enjoyed this mattress topper. I had to let it air out for an hour but once I put it on my bed I did not want to get up. It has been super comfortable. I'm glad I got the actual size for my bed since I read some reviews to get the next size up but it is still a little oversized. Having used it for over a month it has lost a little of it's oomf (which was expected) but is holding up nicely. I would definitely recommend this.;Super Soft & Wonderful
247;48.0;5.0;10.0;I am considering getting a visco mattress and my current mattress could use some help.  This topper made a WORLD of difference, it is allowing me to wait, save up money, and get the bed that I really want without having to suffer through back problems.;Good Buy
457;49.0;5.0;12.0;I ordered the 3.3 Cloud 9 for my son. He loves it and would stay in bed all day if I let him.

My whole family talks about how great the memory foam works and how soft, and comfortable it is. Except, they all cost around 100-900$ in stores. Screw that! lol. Came on here to amazon and spent a whole week reading reviews, reading seller feedback, contacting, the whole schebang! Finally settled on this topper and wow. Impressed, and my boyfriend wakes up on the ""right side of the bed"" now :) Even I feel like I'm on a cloud. such a great night`s sleep. Doesn`t get too hot, and it isn`t so soft that you can`t move at night. Excellent quality, will update after 6 months of use!";Helps with BF`s back problems
120;51.0;5.0;9.0;Well worth the price of $87.79 and free shipping.  I love the 3 inch thickness and the product is OUTSTANDING!  I have never slept so well and the back support is excellent.  I have been using the product about 5 days now and I find that my sleep pattern does not get interrupted during the night.  What impressed me about this product was what other buyers had to say.  The comfort factor is a 10+.  I am ordering another one after I finish this review. By the way, the price value can't be beat.  I checked similar pads at Walmart and the quality, thickness and price could not compare to this product.  This pad fits a full size bed really well and a regular mattress protection pad will fit over this mattress topper and your regular mattress without any problem.  If your sleep is important to you, BUY this product!;I love the 3 inch thickness and the product is OUTSTANDING
149;52.0;4.0;9.0;This is good, but if you rest on your elbow while on the bed, there will be hole-like impressions on the foam. I saw the indents and wrinkles on the foam when I took off my sheets to wash them.\n\nAfter about 2-3 months, the topper isn't as comfortable as when I first got it.;This is good, but if you rest on your elbow while ...
403;53.0;4.0;10.0;I purchased this for my daughters mattress (too firm) and this added the extra bit of comfort we were looking for without being too soft or flat/ uncomfortable.  I am considering a second one for my sofa bed.  Only downside is it does not come with a washable cover.;wonderful, soft, meets the need!
404;54.0;5.0;10.0;Ordered this for an extra bed my son uses when he comes to visit and said the bed hurts his back.  This pad did the trick except now he stays in bed too long.  Product came before estimated delivery date in perfect condition however, I would appreciate the warnings on the packaging were displayed on line for me to view before I make a decision to purchase...;Made an old bed feel new!
422;55.0;5.0;10.0;It has chemical smell, I gave it to my grand son. They don't like the smell. But I would buy more when needed;Thanks,

26;57.0;4.0;8.0;This product has some great qualities accompanied by a couple nagging problems. Despite the few problems that the product has, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an average mattress topper because of the comfort it adds at an average price of $72.49.\n\nAdvantages\nTo start out, this product served its main purpose of adding additional comfort to my bed. I found that rotating the pad after washing the sheets both increases the comfort and durability for holding up my weight while I sleep. This is an important aspect because I am a larger person. Another great part of this product is that it does not slide around and will stay in place while getting in and out of bed. These are all positives that make this product a good purchase.\n\nDisadvantages\nHowever, as mentioned already, there a few nagging problems that don't necessarily take away from the overall product that I expected. First of all, the thickness of this pad does require an additional purchase of a mattress pad cover that can accommodate for the extra three inches of thickness. Also, this pad did make sleep hotter during the summer, but not to an extent that I would get uncomfortable. I am used to sleeping with the temperature set around 65, so even when the temperature raised above this, I was still able to sleep comfortably. Anyone who enjoys a cooler sleep should do fine with this product despite the added heat over the summer.\n\nRecommendation\nOverall, this product has performed exactly as expected and I give it 4 stars in comparison to the higher quality, much more expensive substitutes. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs extra comfort and doesn't mind a little extra heat during the summer months.;Good Product at a Great Price
205;58.0;5.0;9.0;Bought this because I woke up stiff and sore feeling from a too stiff mattress we recently bought. Arrived before the expected date, and was folded in the box. I opened it and put it on the bed the following morning so it would have time to expand while I was at work. Have been sleeping like a baby ever since. No stiffness or soreness. Would recommend to anyone that feels they need a little different support than their mattress is providing.;Love the cloud9

33;60.0;5.0;8.0;This is foamtastic its so comfortable and u sink right in when u lay on it this was everything I imagine it to be;love this
34;61.0;4.0;8.0;You definitely need to let it off-gas for a few hours.  I bought it to put atop a very stiff mattress that normally had us tossing and turning all night. We sleep so much better now.  Just remember you need a deeper pocket fitted sheet to accommodate the added depth.;Definitely worth it
35;62.0;5.0;8.0;OK, I was just talking about this purchase today...Its the best overall practical purchase ever.  I bought this mattress topper for my furry friends, an aging brood that can no longer jump on the bed,  I covered  it with a  waterproof mattress pad, then a soft blanket...My dogs love it! Its perfect for their aging bones, and gives them a soft, warm & comfortable place to sleep for a fraction of the cost of traditional memory foam dog beds... Of course perfect for a bed topper as well, so, so comfortable! Love it!;More than just a perfect mattress topper:)
36;63.0;5.0;8.0;So comfortable! It's like sleeping on a cloud!;awesome

214;67.0;4.0;9.0;Turns a bone-crusher into a comfortable sleep surface.  There have been times when I was moving and had to spend a night on the floor, but I doubled this over, rested my head on two or three pillows on the floor, and it wasn't bad.

218;71.0;5.0;9.0;I am visiting my son in Florida and the mattress on my bed kills my back. It is a queen size mattress. I bought the full size memory foam mattress top because of the price over a hundred dollars different. The full size fits this mattress perfect , if I bought the queen size pad it would have been too big. The bed is now like sleeping on a cloud so comfortable. I highly recommend this topper.;Love this mattress topper !!!
220;72.0;5.0;9.0;No smells.  Lightweight (which surprised me). Fluffed up quickly.  We are using this for our toddlers full bed, which works perfectly for her weight (the firmness/softness).  It's supportive but gives in to the shape of the body perfectly. If we were to put this on our bed, for adults, it wouldn't be soft enough or thick enough for my liking.  I love that it's made in the USA.;Perfect for double bed. Made on the USA!
43;73.0;5.0;8.0;Very good;Five Stars
44;74.0;5.0;8.0;Got here earlier than expected, which is a plus. There is a smell, but bet it will go away over time. It really form fits your body and for someone with a sore back I am happy.;It really form fits your body and for someone with a sore back I am happy.

53;82.0;5.0;8.0;GET THIS THING WHILE THE SALE IS THIS GOOD!\nSpending 60-70 bucks on this when its worth 378 is so worth it. My mattress is 18 years old and as soon as I put this on it, it felt brand new.\nNeutralize the smell with some air freshener or odoban and it eliminates the problem right away.\nAlso give the pad a few hours to lay flat on your mattress so it can puff back up.\n\nThe shipping was also incredibly fast, it arrived over a week before the estimated delivery date.\nI highly recommend this.;GREAT DEAL
248;83.0;4.0;9.0;The Cloud 9 Bedding made a huge difference in our sleeping comfort. We highly recommend the product to those having problems sleeping.;Sleeping Comfort greatly improved
249;84.0;5.0;9.0;This came way early than expected. Its very comfortable and I get a more restful night on using this cloud.;very comfortable
250;85.0;4.0;9.0;Its very comfy. I would highly recommend this to any one seeking a better night sleep. You cant go wrong with this.;Its very comfy
70;86.0;5.0;8.0;First I want to rate the seller as Fantastic!  I mistakenly  ordered a full size  instead of a queen and after one email the correct size was on the way with a return shipping label for the first one.  Customer service is AAA+++!\nThe memory foam topper plumped up within a couple hours of unpacking. Smell wasn't bad at all. I slept on it that night and it felt wonderful!  I was looking for something to ease the aches and pains and this helps tremendously. For the price- it was the best purchase I made all year!;Great topper - even greater customer service!
72;87.0;5.0;8.0;I've had mine for about 5 months and it's for a full mattress.  I paid ~75 dollars.  I haven't noticed a decline in support or any soft spots forming.  I will recommend buying a mattress cover as well, because I've noticed the pad slightly yellowing over time (from the oil in one's skin).  I mean, I bathe daily and change my sheets weekly, so it isn't like I'm a dirty person.\n\nI live in a dorm with a plastic-covered mattress and a hard spring brace.  It was difficult to sleep prior to this topper.  It's great with it.  Now, I actually have something of value to lure my girlfriend over.;Highly Recommend - Great Support
251;88.0;5.0;9.0;This topper is super comfi. I'm giving it 5 stars. Made me lazy though cause i always want to extend my bed time now since i got this.;It's a winner purchase!
74;89.0;5.0;8.0;Great topper for price;sleep great
76;90.0;5.0;8.0;This pad was all I had hoped it would be.  I sometimes stay as a guest with a friend and the guest bed is rock hard.  This pad solved that wonderfully.  I slept very well.\nThe pad DID have a bit of an aroma when first unpacked, but this dissipated very quickly and was not an issue to me in any way.;Very happy with this purchase.
264;91.0;5.0;9.0;my 6 and 8 year old Grands love jumping on their bunkbeds, (i know) but boys will be boys! Well they broke the supports under the large bed, so we screwed plywood underneath the mattress- wow too solid! so i bought this and -Wah Lah! Very good cushion for sleeping! My oldest grand even face timed me to show me how soft it is! They (and we) love it!;Perfect for a bunkbed mattress topper too!
265;92.0;5.0;9.0;This topper is an excellent value for what you get with the price.  Turned an overly firm mattress into a pillow top.  I would highly recommend this for anybody that needs a little more comfort for their bed.  Loved it so much I bought another for my kid's bed.;great value!
91;93.0;5.0;8.0;I never knew about memory foam mattresses until I had back pain from work and became interested in finding something to help it at night. It's like night and day from the time I used my regular bed until I added this to my bed! I've had this for about a year now and it is still going strong!!!! Definitely has some discoloration to it and I clean my sheets once a week, but I guess that's just the normal process of foam??? Regardless it still works wonderfully and does the job I need it to... a good nights rest with no back pains.;Perfect for those who have back pain and need relief!
298;94.0;5.0;9.0;So Comfortable. No problem with any chemical spell and it fluffed up quickly. I flip it once a month the keep the wear even.\n\nUpdate... It has been 5 months since I bought this and it is still very comfortable. Flipping it once a month does keep from wear on any specific part of the topper. It does tend to creep down the mattress a bit but buying a no-slip mat like what would go under an area rug takes care of that. (You can find them cheap on Amazon.) Just buy one half the length and width of your topper put it between the topper and mattress and problem solved. A short time after it was delivered I got a call from the seller making sure I was happy with the product. I told them I wouldn't trade it for any of the more expensive ones I have tried. I would recommend this purchase to anyone who wants more comfort from their mattress!;Happy
299;95.0;5.0;9.0;I don't have enough good things to say about this product. We had an old firm mattress that was like sleeping on concrete. It finally got so bad that I had to sleep on the couch. This mattress topper is a miracle. I can finally sleep in a bed again. It feels like a whole new(and expensive) mattress now! Also it arrived in less than 2 days!;I finally wake up with no back pain
300;96.0;5.0;9.0;I love love love this! My back is ruined from years of wearing bras that are too tight, sleeping in them, and sleeping on mattresses that are a hundred years old with springs that seem like they were conceived as a torture device. I wake up every morning in terrible pain almost to tears because my back feels like its gonna break if I move. Well I decided I had enough and splurged on this mattress topper with very high hopes of never again waking up with several daggers lodged in my spine. It was delivered within 3 days of when I placed the order! When it arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised at just how soft it is. Cloud 9 indeed! The very first morning I awoke after sleeping on it my back felt absolutely wonderful. It is the most amazing thing I have ever slept on and I am SO happy I bought it. So if you are like me and have a back that is in constant pain from years of neglect, buy this and your poor, achy spine will forgive you and even begin to love you! The only drawback is that you may be late for work because it is almost impossible to force yourself to leave your heavenly cloud bed!;Just like a cloud
306;97.0;5.0;9.0;I purchased this to top my sons futon. It has made a huge difference for his comfort and he loves it!!!;Great Topper, Great Price
326;98.0;4.0;9.0;This is a very good buy especially for the price. The cost is reasonable, and it helps me sleep better.;Helped me sleep better
328;99.0;4.0;9.0;Comfortable, soft, and holding its shape so far. (2 months). Not a miracle worker. It doesnt make a 200 dollar bed amazing but if your bed is a little to firm for your liking it is a cheap alternative to buying a whole new bed set;It was what i expected for 60 bucks
342;100.0;5.0;9.0;Any negative reviews on this didn't have realistic expectations for the money in my opinion, because this thing is fantastic! Made my bed so much more comfortable. I have dogs that sleep on the bed every now and again so I put a cheap faux down mattress topper on over it for extra protection. It does feel a little warm, but that's only if I'm laying in it on a hot day with no ac on..so..I'd be hot laying on anything. I spent about 2 months trying to find a good tipper to bring my bed back to life for a reasonable price and I'm so glad I went with this one. Only down side..there was a dead bug in the packaging..which made me freak out.;Just what my bed needed!
159;101.0;4.0;8.0;DEFINITELY HELPS CONTROL BACK PAIN - COULD USE A  MATTRESS COVER, REMOVABLE PREFERRED.;HELPS CONTROL BACK PAIN
402;102.0;5.0;9.0;"The topper is not made from earth grown materials therefore the expectation must be that there will be some chemical smell. There is a disclaimer that this item flammable on the packaging (but i always think if you put anything on fire ...it will be on fire!..just keep everything away from fire simple solution). Upon opening it had very little to no smell (had to push my nose so it makes an impression into it to smell it actually) and I still listened to the other reviewers and i aired it out on its own for at least an hour. The result was perfect. The corners of it was a little tricky when putting on the mattress pad and another reviewer had a great idea of putting a paper plate on the edges and cutting around it as a guide (that wasn't necessary in my case but good luck to those who are bugged by the sharp corners).I would suggest another layer of a mattress pad on top of the topper to secure it so it won't move around and then added the fitted sheet and flat sheet. This topper is super comfy!! CAUTION: you will feel lazy, social events won't see so appealing, and the friendly receptionists at your gym will be thinking ""another one bites the dust"". How can one feel so upset about leaving their bed? If you don't mind if your only concern in the world will be ""are you small enough to still fit unto your now wonderful bed with your dreamy toppe"": (no matter what your old trainer says) then this 3.3 cloud9 is for you.";IM ANGRY WHEN I LEAVE MY BED!!
406;103.0;4.0;9.0;Well I have alot to say about this. I intentionally waited to give a review on this product so I could see how it would be after I had slept on it over a period of time. When I first put it on my bed I thought I was sleeping in heaven cause my sleep had improved that much. I had no more pain when I slept, I was able to now sleep during the night, & actually didn't wake up doing the night. But over time the pad has given some & it doesn't sleep the same as it did when I got it about 3wks ago. It seems as if it doesn't mold my body the same as it once did. It still sleeps better than my plain mattress but just not as good as it did when I got it about 3 wks ago so I can only imagine what its gonna feel like a year from now.;Nice
172;104.0;5.0;8.0;"We have a bed at my mother in-law's that we call the ""cruel bed"". It's better than the floor...maybe. This addition really added to the ability to sleep; so we didn't wake up with bruises up and down our bodies after a nights sleep. I now don't need an hour long hot shower to return feeling to my body after sleeping. I can only imagine how this would make a comfortable bed feel!";Totally worth it.
176;105.0;4.0;8.0;This mattress topper really made the difference in my last bed purchase! I purchased a mattress and box spring online and it turned out to be horribly uncomfortable!! I bought this mattress topper and it was thick enough to provide comfort from the springs in the mattress.;Very comfortable, good price
437;106.0;4.0;9.0;"Ordered full size, arrived quickly, suction wrapped in plastic and in a box. Box was surprisingly small. The mattress was folded nicely, once cut from plastic it had a mild odor that dissipated by the time it made it to the bed. Very nicely cut, not misshapen, bright white with shimmer like a new snowfall color. Fit a full size perfectly, no problem getting deep fitted sheets to fit. Now that being said, I recently ordered a memory foam mattress from amazon a few months ago. Compared, I would go with my ""other"" order and not this one for specific pressure point relief. This cloud mattress topper feels like a soft spongy foam, it is comfortable and though it serves its purpose and feels great, the other memory foam I ordered feels more like a gel memory foam, instead of just soft and spongy. The other one conforms better, distributes weight better and releases pressure points better. But...again, this one today isn't bad, it is for a child's room but for mine, I will stick to the other. (Density Visco 4 lb)";Serves the purpose but...had better.
439;107.0;4.0;9.0;this mattress pad lasted me through my two year tour in japan...only down fall was that it was too short for my bed. i had a full size bed and it did not reach the bottom of it..so if i order it again i would order a size bigger than my bed.;not bad
200;108.0;5.0;8.0;Bought the 3.3 Cloud9 memory foam mattress to use at a vacation rental because the bed was so uncomfortable.  The memory foam mattress alleviated my discomfort and I brought it home to use on y guest bed.  The price was reasonable and worth every dime.;Really is cloud nine
201;109.0;5.0;8.0;I read the other reviews - this product was exactly as described - I love it and the price was great too;great buy
206;110.0;5.0;8.0;This is the most comfortable surface I've ever slept on, much moreso than the denser memory foam toppers I've had in the past.;Ahhhhhh..........
207;111.0;5.0;8.0;ordered other things and it came in b4 those. very comfortable and makes a big difference with my mattress instead of buying a whole new bed;came in super early

209;115.0;5.0;8.0;This is so comfortable.  I look forward to going to bed on this topper.  It is probably too thin for heavy people, though.;Heaven on Earth
210;116.0;4.0;8.0;A really great product for those looking to make they're bed more comfortable. I used it on a futon that had the springs coming through and it made it feel like a cloud. It does get worn down after excessive use, but still does the job. I've been rotating mine every month or so which has helped. There is a chemical smell to it when it arrives but it goes away after a week or so.;Great product.
211;117.0;4.0;8.0;i'm loving it!!!!!!  It's just what i wanted to make the bed more comfortable with no tossing and turning all night.;just what you need for back problems

219;120.0;5.0;8.0;I love my memory foam mattress.  I found it on my doorstep as I was not told that is had been shipped so was surprised but pleased to wake up Saturday morning and it was by the front door.  We have an uncomfortable bed and waiting to purchase a new one so had to have something that would firm up the mattress and the memory foam provided that.  We had one before on our previous bed so I was familiar with how they worked and this works great for a bed that needs firming up.;Love My Foam Mattress

58;155.0;5.0;7.0;"After shopping around for several memory foam mattress toppers I stumbled upon this and thought I would give it a try after all the great reviews and low price. We are using it on our Ikea Lysksele fold out bed in our guest room and it makes the bed SO much comfortable. Once we fold the bed up into a sofa, we store the mattress topper on our queen size bed and use it as extra support. It feels really comfortable to me. Like any memory foam mattress or topper, it does really exaggerate your body heat, so it gets pretty toasty in the summertime, but I already expected that as we have a memory foam mattress.\n\nI do notice after sitting/laying on the bed that the topper seems really squished down, but once we get up and have been out of bed for awhile it goes right back to the shape that it's supposed to have. Also, as several people have commented, there is a smell to the topper at first. I would say that the ""stink"" was gone in ours within 4-5 days or so.\n\nI was skeptical that for $60 we could fix the problem of our very uncomfortable guest bed, but this has made things SO much better! I would recommend this!";Pleasantly Surprised!
272;156.0;5.0;8.0;Gave this as a gift to my daughter.  She was suffering from some nerve issues which left her hands numb by morning.  This lovely cloud of foam relieves the pressure causing the problem and she wakes up able to move and feel her fingers.;Yeah!  A good night's sleep!
273;157.0;4.0;8.0;This item was a good relief.  My mattress is on its last leg, and I got this to soften up and try to get a couple more years.  I was surprised how it expanded so much from a small box, but it is SO much better than I had.  It seemed a couple inches short of the mattress, but all is good!;works great

First and foremost: THERE WAS NO ODOR WHATSOEVER when I opened the packing. I was able to lay this flat in my bedroom to expand and it required no ""airing out"" even though the instructions called for it. This made me extremely happy as I read many reviews about various products that the odor on these toppers can be quite offensive. I have also experienced no odor at all once I put it on my bed. I have been very happy with the results of this topper in helping with my back pain. I understand thickness and density are the two qualifying factors for choosing a topper, I would estimate that this topper is on the lower side of the density scale as it has a fair amount of give when I lay on it, but the thickness combined with the lower density makes it very conforming to your body shape.

438;269.0;4.0;8.0;dog hates it, he is old and now can't jump on the bed because now it is too high for his fat lazy butt, should have bought it years ago, hate the fact he sleeps on my bed all day while I slave away at work, thinking of buying a memory foam couch and chair pad.  Little sucker has been sponging off me for 11 years contributing nothing but urine waste which I have to clean up since he thinks a puppy pad is just simply a spot he should not pee on.  I know what you are thinking I should take him out more, I would if not for the fact that I have to work long hours to pay for his vet bill, designer dog food and grooming, and lets not leave out the costs of the collars leashes and kerchiefs that he demands that match my outfit when we go to the dog park.....never buy a Bijon...they are so fashion forward...I have to shop constantly or he will not be seen with me.;pretty good
167;270.0;5.0;7.0;Love this foam mattress topper! Extremely comfortable. Relives pressure points so I hardly toss and turn. I can finally get a full nights rest. Once you open it, wash it, hang it outside to air out. Factory smell is pretty strong.;Finally a full nights rest!
168;271.0;5.0;7.0;I'm using it on my trailer bed, those notoriously hard mattresses, and it turned my Scamp into a luxury sleep on the road.;Worked great!
169;272.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this product for my grandson.  Easy to clean up, when he spills juice on it.  Just clean and put out side for a bit.;Cloud 9
170;273.0;5.0;7.0;A good buy for a more comfortable bed. Now I don't have to buy a new bed yet because now is not the right time to buy new furniture.;sweet dreams
441;274.0;5.0;8.0;I recently purchased the 3 inch memory foam mattress to put on top of my existing bedding to ease the pain of sleeping on my side because of scoliosis. It has really helped and I am sleeping more and waking up less during the night. I would recommend this mattress to anyone, not just for people that have joint problems. I wish it came with a cover, but it does not. A regular flannel sheet stays on it very well.;Memory foam mattress
171;275.0;5.0;7.0;I have an older craftmatic adjustable bed, which I needed after back surgery.  I had tried other mattress toppers, which bunched up in the small of my back.  Have had this Cloud for several  months now.  No bunching, very firm but no pressure points.  A delight to sleep on,  and my dog loves it , too.;It is a cloud
173;276.0;5.0;7.0;This is a good solution in order to give to your mattress an extra cushion. You can extend the life of your mattres by buying one of those. We have been using this for months and shape remains unvariable.;Perfect
174;277.0;4.0;7.0;This is awesome! However, you have to buy a pad or something thick to cover it because the plastic gets really hot. Besides that, it's pretty amazing.;It's really like a cloud!
175;278.0;5.0;7.0;This is the BEST purchase I've made in years!! I had purchased two mattress pads for two different beds. The 3.3 is like sleeping on a cloud, i'm throwing the other pad away and buying another one of these!;Heavenly!!!
177;279.0;5.0;7.0;What the heading says! I didn't have money to get a $1,000 mattress and I know how important sleep is for the body. THIS PAD IS THE BEST!;Made my cheap mattress feel like a CLOUD!
178;280.0;5.0;7.0;Wow. Since getting this I have been sleeping so much better. I've achieved REM sleep and have experienced more vivid dreams since this purchase.\nLast night I dreamed a Giant spider was in my house and eat my sisters face, the night before I had a dream that I was hooking up with my ex who had amazing bedroom skills. My dreams have been more than just that I've gotten to the point I don't want to wake up anymore, and find myself going to sleep at 9:30pm and waking up the next day at about 1:30pm. I probably haven't slept this good in about 6.5yrs;slept so good.
181;281.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this for our lake house bed. I was having hip pains so bad and was only sleeping a couple hours a night. The first day I received it I was worried about a smell. No smell at all. And I slept the entire night.  Best money I have ever spent.;I am so Happy with my purchase
182;282.0;5.0;7.0;Good price with good quality. I like it and I have been using it for 2 weeks now. It is worth buying;cery comfortable
183;283.0;4.0;7.0;Pretty awesome. Doesn't have a cover to go around it & the quality reminds me of an egg carton, but overall, it is a great find for the price that it is listed as.;Sweet Deal
184;284.0;5.0;7.0;I have a very hard mattress. I was always getting charlie horses sleeping on it. I put the Cloud9 3.3 Mattress on it, and now I sleep better than ever. No more charlie horses. It is a good product and an excellent value.;A very good product.
185;285.0;4.0;7.0;I purchased this product for my double Fulton bunk bed at my hunting camp as the futon cushion is like a lumpy couch. It works fine but I will reserve final judgment after the 2014 hunting season to see how it holds up.;Got it for my futon bed.
447;286.0;4.0;8.0;Great value!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this purchase. It is very comfortable and doesn't have the odor that is usually associated with memory foam.;It's great
186;287.0;5.0;7.0;I purchased this to put on top of my 5 year old granddaughter's full size mattress on her bunk bed.  It arrived in about a week.  I opened it, planning on having to air it out for 3-4 days but there was very little smell.  The difference was like night and day!  It turned the sorry excuse for a mattress into a very soft and comfortable sleep experience.  It's the favorite mattress of her sisters as well and now the others all want one.  I'll probably buy one for myself as well.  Since this was the least expensive I found my expectations were not so high, but I've been very pleased with this purchase.  Her full size sheets still fit perfectly.;Now the whole family wants one!
187;288.0;4.0;7.0;The name describes this mattress foam perfectly.  I bought it for my spare bedroom as I did not spend a lot on the mattress seeing it does not used that often.  Now I go and take a nap on it it was well worth the money.  This was a great deal.;Cloud 9
188;289.0;4.0;7.0;Great for the price, I want another to stack on this one!!! Shipped quick and I had zero odor problems.;Sleep on a cloud
448;290.0;5.0;8.0;"We bought this to top an older pillow-top mattress that wasn't all that comfortable.  The memory foam mattress is very comfortable and my college-age granddaughter who is living with us to go to school is very happy with her ""new"" mattress.";My granddaughter loves her bed

193;294.0;5.0;7.0;I love it, made my rock hard bed, into a fantastic wonderland.  No issues or smell that I had feared from reading the reviews.  Made a world of difference, and I love being in my bed now!;So Comfy
449;295.0;4.0;8.0;First the 3.3 Cloud had a rough ride and was sent to a different place, not due to the company selling the item, just the deliverers. Overall it certainly is comfortable, and seems quite durable. It has been worth every penny!!;cloud...
194;296.0;5.0;7.0;I have had memory foam mattress covers before. They were thinner and cost quite a bit more.\nI love this one..It is perfect. And one can not beat this price.;Memory Foam Mattress Topper
195;297.0;5.0;7.0;Great memory foam product that turns a regular mattress into one that feels like an expensive full memory foam mattress.  No need to spend more money on another brand with the same dimensions.;Excellent quality and value
196;298.0;5.0;7.0;I am so happy I ordered this topper for my bed. It is the most comfortable sleeping experience I could ever ask for. As so as I lay down, its not long before I am asleep and do not wake up during the night. I would recommend this product to everyone.;So comfortable
197;299.0;4.0;7.0;I couldn't believe how fast I got it.  I love how this has improved the comfort of my bed.  I have an old mattress and didn't want to spend the money to replace it.  I think this was the better option.  Very comfy!!!!;SUPER FAST shipping
198;300.0;4.0;7.0;several hours after unpacking, let the memory foam\nair out and expand before covering with your bed sheet\nthen let the foam do it's magic! Very comfy and the price\nis very reasonable. Thanks for the complimentary\npkg!;Seller very accommodating!
199;301.0;5.0;7.0;Very comfortable.  My back feels better in the mornings. Especially nice getting into bed at night, soft, but not too soft.;Great value
11;302.0;1.0;6.0;"This product is nothing more than a cheap piece of regular foam. I was surprised at how lightweight it was when it arrived, but hoped it was because of a better manufacturing process. This was not the case. After two weeks it was sagging horribly, and I had to take it off the bed. It also ruined my best set of sheets (which used to be white), with a permanent outline of the beige color of the foam. I have purchased two ""real"" memory foam mattress pads in the past (through our local warehouse giants) and wish I had just gone back there instead. I may cut this up to use in our dog's bed.";Very low quality piece of regular foam.
450;303.0;5.0;8.0;If you are looking for something to make your bed a bit more comfortable, and aren't sure whether or not to pull the trigger - do it. I wasn't sure prior to buying this after reading the reviews, but now that I have it, I only have one regret : that I didn't buy this sooner.;Just Do It
452;304.0;5.0;8.0;Bought this for my college daughter when she moved from the dorms.  She had one in the dorm and she said the only thing she would miss was the memory foam(Dorm was a twin--new full bed) Surprised her with a new full size.  She was elated, to say the least! The other roommates were completely envious and so was one of the Moms.  She asked me to hurry and cover it, before her daughter saw it, and wanted one!!  It was like sleeping on a cloud--I have since purchased a queen for myself--LOVE it!!;Envy of the house!!
230;305.0;4.0;7.0;It was a tad bit too big for my double mattress, but with the mattress pad cover I was able to secure it. I actually was surprised that it will take a little getting use to. It does provide a firmer surface & I was pleased that I did not feel the discomfort in my right hip that tends to bother me at night on just the mattress. Last night was the 1st time I slept on it, so time will tell if it was a good investment.;mattress topper
231;306.0;5.0;7.0;First off, I want to say this arrived about a week before the estimated delivery date. Also, I didn't notice a strong chemical smell like other are reviewers mentioned. And the creases and folds came out of it as soon as I pulled it out of the bag and put it on my bed. I bought this because my mattress is super hard and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a new one. I absolutely love it, I took a nap on it as soon as I put it on my bed! haha. :);So Comfy!
233;307.0;4.0;7.0;Super comfy.  I bought this for extra cushioning for my futon since the original mattress is so thin.  It works well!;comfy
235;308.0;4.0;7.0;For the money, this was the best memory foam mattress out there. It arrived super fast and didn't take that long to unfurl. The smell that other reviewers talked about disappeared very quickly and I've had no issues with it. Overall great product.;Excellent choice
239;309.0;5.0;7.0;LOVE IT!\nI would recommend it to all my friends and any one that ask about memory foam mattresses.\nGreat for a good nights sleep.;All I ever wished for!
240;310.0;4.0;7.0;I made a mistake because I wanted the twin size and ordered full, but the quality is nice and comfortable!;I like it
15;311.0;5.0;6.0;OMG..I've had this for almost a year and it still feels like it were new. I sleep like a baby now. It alleviated my minor back pain. I don't know if I can ever sleep without one again.;In the clouds.

261;320.0;5.0;7.0;I love my Memory Foam Mattress. I have been sleeping so much better now. I will get another one if I need to. Thanks;Love it
268;321.0;5.0;7.0;I bought a new mattress a year ago and it was too hard on our backs. It's a lot cheaper then buying a new mattress and so far so good with it not braking down like some of the comments have stated. My boyfriend and I love that it absorbs the shock of the other persons movements during the night. For the price ya can't beat it!;LOVE IT!!!!!
269;322.0;5.0;7.0;This topper has been a saver for my back and hips. I use it every night, and I got it a few months ago. It is holding up great. My poodle even seems to be getting around better since  he has been sleeping on it.  I highly recommend......;Sleeping on a cloud
271;323.0;5.0;7.0;Item arrived promptly and as described. No complaints. No issues. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase and with the seller. Daughter has trouble sleeping and has a tender back due to an auto accident. She sleeps much better and far more comfortably on this memory foam topper;Love the added comfort
276;324.0;5.0;7.0;This arrived earlier than expected :-) I unfolded it, let it fluff up, put it over my grandparent's old mattress. Then I made up the bed and when I laid down Omgosh I could feel the pain draining out of my back! Slept so well last night! Not as amazing as my memory foam mattress at home but Wow! What an improvement of an old mattress for a fraction of the cost! Strongly recommend this foam mattress topper with a soft waterproof mattress cover over it :-);Excellent!
277;325.0;4.0;7.0;I had been considering purchasing a new mattress this year until I purchased this foam topper to my 10 year mattress. It has been a noticeable improvement. I have  not had any complaints. I aired it out for 24-48 hours before first using it. It doesn't compact or stay in your body shape for any extended time if you toss and turn. I haven't been overheating since using it, which was a concern.\n\nI would recommend to family and friends who are wanting comfort and not yet ready for a new mattress to extend the life and comfort of their bedding and a better nights sleep.;Saved me money!
278;326.0;4.0;7.0;I needed something on my mattress for my back.  It has helped  to relieve my morning back ache a lot.;Great mattress pad.
279;327.0;5.0;7.0;My son wanted a memory foam mattress but since is way to expensive and his mattress is fairly new I decided to purchase this topper to make him happy.  It was everything he expected. This topper makes his bed extra comfy. It's so good that I'm planning to get one for my bed too.;Cloud 9 for sure
280;328.0;4.0;7.0;This is a great, cheap way to improve a poor mattress.  Very comfortable, my fiance loves it.  The pad did need to be trimmed to fit my mattress but another buyer's comment to use a steak knife proved to be very useful. (Just be mindful of the shavings that will be produced while cutting).  Overall I'm happy with the purchase!;Great product
282;329.0;5.0;7.0;This is an awesome pad. It's very comfortable, used it camping on an old hard camper bed and it was perfect.;Very good deal for comfort!
283;330.0;5.0;7.0;Great price if you are looking for one.  It made my bed usable. If you go to Walmart you pay 3x's the price;Mattress pad
284;331.0;5.0;7.0;This is amazing and heavenly. I was debating on get a new mattress at Sam's Club for $300. But I did not have anyone to help me take it home or drive it home. A new bed means having to take the other one out of the house. That's too much trouble and lots of lifting. This was a great choice for me, cuz it was shipped to me. I read some of the other reviews about opening the package is a empty space room or place and let it the air back into it. I let it open a day before putting it on top of my bed. I love love it so much, I have to have several alarm set, so I will not over sleep. There are so many days, I just want to lay there and just relax. You will be spending a lot of time in bed. Its been the best sleep, I have ever had. At the same time, I could have gone with 2 inches. Great price for 3 inches.;Best sleep in years... Like New
285;332.0;4.0;7.0;Delivery excellent. Found product to be kind of hard at first but gets softer after lying on it for awhile. If in doubt if 3 inch mattress is enough then would suggest to add another inch.;Delivery excellent
286;333.0;5.0;7.0;Completely transformed my bed. Couldn't wait to get into it at night! Did not notice any odor. Bought another for the spare room;heavenly, highy recommend
287;334.0;5.0;7.0;I sleep on a combination Sofa, Chaise Lounge and Full-size Bed.  It has that seam down the middle ( where the sofa fold is ) which makes sleeping uncomfortable.  The mattress Topper has eliminated the seam and the discomfort yet I can still use it as a Chaise Lounge or Sofa.  The advertising claims are true--it is like sleeping on a cloud.;My needs were met
288;335.0;5.0;7.0;I ordered this full sized mattress for a roll away bed I also purchased from Amazon. It was easy to cut down to size using an electric kitchen knife. It fit perfectly and is oh so comfortable. Love it.;Good buy
289;336.0;5.0;7.0;I feel like I'm sleeping on the remains of a horde of angels!  So comfortable!!  I bet Jesus wasn't even this comfortable during his final days.  Ahhhhh so nice!;Like sleeping on a pile of angels

308;343.0;4.0;7.0;I purchased this for my daughter to hold off on buying a new mattress for a bit. She absolutely loves it! I purchased a different one about 3 years ago and I still love it, but I think this one is even better! Definitely worth the money and would recommend.;My daughter loves it!
309;344.0;4.0;7.0;"Very comfortable and worth the money. Had a slight smell that disappeared shortly after unwrapping. This Mattress is 3"", a 1.5""  mattress may however be superior on an overly soft bed.\n\nAs a bonus, I use this memory foam mattress when camping. It is far superior to any air mattress";Excellent and affordable way to make almost any bed comfortable
310;345.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this not expecting it to be spectacular but I LOVE IT. It is perfect, the 3 inches is exactly what I needed and it was a super low price! I was looking for a memory foam for a while but I couldn't find anything for under $150 so I stopped looking around. After I got rear ended and my car got totaled, I had to go to the chiropractor pretty frequently and he suggested I get a memory foam mattress to help relax my back and let me tell you, it helped so much! My back is not as tight anymore, I've had it since March and it was one of the smartest buys I have done. It was so good that my sister bought the same one. I love it and I definitely recommend it to someone else.;Great Product! Great Buy!
311;346.0;5.0;7.0;This is the best money I ever spent. I love this, it makes my bed so soft I never want to get out of bed. It is literally like laying on a cloud, floating in the air with nothing under you.;Like laying on a cloud

318;350.0;4.0;7.0;I use this on top of a futon bead that was really hard.  It has made a big difference in the comfort of my guests sleep.  I found this pad to be a little larger than the double size futon sofa that I bought it for.;Memory Foam Mattress Pad
319;351.0;5.0;7.0;I was concerned when I received it, because it just seemed like any other foam pad. After sleeping on it for a couple weeks I have come to really appreciate it.

346;368.0;5.0;7.0;Arrived on time perfect size just the right amount of firmness great product would recommend does not seam to hold body heat;Could not beat the price
347;369.0;4.0;7.0;For what it costs it is a very good product.  You can buy much better but you will pay several times the price of this one.  We use them on guest beds and have had no complaints so far.  (You don't want your guests to be TOO comfortable - they may never leave).  I would definitely recommend this product as a great value for the price.;Does the job
348;370.0;5.0;7.0;My daughter has a memory foam cover on her bed in her college dorm.  When she came home for Christmas her comment that her bed (which has a great mattress) was not as comfortable as her bed at college because of the topper.  After reading reviews on many memory foam items, we chose this one for her bed at home.  When she came home for the summer she was thrilled with her new mattress topper.  Her bed at home once again gets higher reviews than her bed at college :);Cloud9 is Right!
349;371.0;4.0;7.0;This is the best! (Besides the actual tempeurpedic or how ever you spell that) The only thing thats bad about it is at first its not as good but thats only because you have to break it in! I highly recommend this specific one!;I loved it so much i bought 2 more!
351;372.0;5.0;7.0;This memory foam pad was delivered in record speed, just a matter of three or four days.  It sprang to life and was good to go in 24 hours. The slight odor I noticed when unwrapping the pad was gone in a matter of hours.  I have been sleeping on it comfortably for about four months.  Because it was so reasonably priced I was concerned about the quality, but as it turn out it was just a good bargain.  Anyone who likes a soft, cool, comfortable memory foam pad at a great price I would recommend  this product.;Just Like Sleeping on a Cloud
352;373.0;5.0;7.0;Soft & comfortable just as they said it would be, great price and great value. I'm sleeping much better now;Foam Mattress
354;374.0;5.0;7.0;After 10 years of using Amazon, this is my first review. This mattress topper is AWESOME. I share a condo in another city where I have a mattress that leaves me with back and shoulder pain every morning. This thing made me sleep like a rock and is just about as comfortable as the TempurPedic my wife and I spent thousands of $$ on at home. Great product.;Awesome
355;375.0;5.0;7.0;The foam arrived VERY quickly, and was nicer than I expected. I purchased this foam to make 3 bench cushions (for window benches and a dining storage bench). I set the foam onto a bed, as advised, to let it expand. It was so comfortable that I decided to purchase another for the guest bed.;Good deal!
356;376.0;4.0;7.0;Great memory foam topper. It is very soft. I use mine to go camping as it is lightweight and is thick enough to put on the hard ground to make it comfortable. I am sure on a bed it is even better.;Lightweight and comfy.
357;377.0;5.0;7.0;This is definetely cheaper than purchasing a new mattress. I found it to be very comfortable. The only draw back to it is that my fitted sheets are a little snug. At this price I am going to order one for another bed that has a warn out mattress. Your only regret will be that you didn't order yours sooner!;Better than a new mattress!
358;378.0;4.0;7.0;"I'm a college student and my parents were nice enough to buy me a new mattress. The only problem was that it was rock hard (but free, I'm not complaining!) I got this pad and WOW! I was scared the first couple days that I wouldn't be able to get out of bed. You really sink into the foam. I have never had a ***real*** memory foam bed so I'm not sure how it compares but I wasn't expecting something so thick! My boyfriend is a big guy (6'2"", almost 200 lbs) and I've noticed on his side that there's a slight indent on his side after about a month. The shape is also awkward and goes over the sides of my double bed, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars for the price and the great sleep I've been getting!";Definitely worth the price.
359;379.0;5.0;7.0;this foam topper is awesome, turned a sofa bed into a very comfy bed. no more springs in my back!!!! :);awesome product
360;380.0;4.0;7.0;Which is fine for me, but not so much for my husband. But is a great alternative to make your mattress feel new for a fraction of the price!;Comfy, but holds in the heat
361;381.0;5.0;7.0;Great price and met my expectations! It perfectly fit the bed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering with back pain.;Great buy
362;382.0;5.0;7.0;My husband and I love this mattress topper so much that it is difficult to get out of bed in the morning.  This topper made an aging mattress feel like a new one, so comfortable and is wearing well.  We will order another one for the bed in the guest room.;Sweet Dreams!
363;383.0;5.0;7.0;This has given our bed new life. Our mid age daughter is visiting for six weeks and finds the comfort amazing. Great product.;Very comfy
364;384.0;5.0;7.0;"I bought this for a friend. And they said they loved it :). She said her husband woke up and said ""wow"" lol.";Bought for a friend
365;385.0;4.0;7.0;This is a quality product at a VERY reasonable price.\n\nNice and thick and as nice or nicer that toppers that are twice the price. Don't hesitate on this one.;What a great buy!
366;386.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this padding to make a hard bed sleepable. I received the topper very quickly and the customer service called a few times to make sure I was happy with the product. It is a little over sized, but it was nice because I don't have to worry about the topper moving off the bed ever.;yes
367;387.0;5.0;7.0;After a lot of research and reading many reviews I picked this one. It is the most amazing mattress pad ever!! So comfy!!!;Will love it
368;388.0;4.0;7.0;"It rolled up easily after use and I was able to wrap it up in the plastic bag ti came into store it.  My on;ly criticism is that I felt the density was a bit on the light side.  Don't  throw the wrappings away if you have to storethe pad between ues.";Pad arrived in just a few days.  When I unpacked it, there was no odor at all and the folds and packing creases disappeared over
369;389.0;4.0;7.0;Mattress topper is very comfortable. Good value for money. I would recommend it to anybody looking for reasonable memory foam with good quality.;Good quality and comfort at affordable price
370;390.0;5.0;7.0;I bought 2 of these because of the great reviews and the great price.  They are super comfortable!!! I highly recommend!!!!;Love it!!
372;391.0;5.0;7.0;just received the mattress topper, i have an ultra firm\nmattress that is 6 months old, woke up every morning\ncrippled with pain in hip and back. this made all the\ndifference in the world on a very hard mattress!\ngood quality, packed well and arrived ahead of schedule.\ngood price also, thanks.;mattress
373;392.0;5.0;7.0;I just wanted to say that I normally do NOT write reviews, but I had a mattress where I would wake up just achy and sore and I went and had a massage and just the mattress sucked! I bought a new mattress and noticed I was sleeping a little better. But I ordered this and JUST put this on my new mattress and it has only been a couple days now since I have been sleeping on it AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! I literally feel like I am sleeping on a cloud! I no longer wake up with aches or pains I get well rested nights sleep. It is literally AMAZING! my animals even love it! I almost bought one from walmart on sale for 19 and I am glad I didnt!! this is worth spending the 60 dollars on!;A-MAZ-ING!
374;393.0;5.0;7.0;I must say I am completely happy with the 3.3 Cloud9 Memory Foam Mattress Topper. I ordered this item the day before a major US Holiday and still received fast processing/shipping (the mattress topper arrived in less than a week!). For about two months prior to ordering the Cloud9 Memory Foam Mattress Topper I had not been sleeping well. I knew eventually I would need to get a new one, however I didn't have the money to drop on a new mattress, so I decided on a less expensive alternative.\n\nI cannot completely describe just how happy I am with my purchase. For the fraction of the cost of buying a new mattress I was able to transform my bed into a heavenly bed. Last night was the first night I slept on the 3.3 Cloud9 and today I already feel so much better. I did not wake up with any stiffness, soreness, or back pain. I slept through the night and I feel so well rested today.\n\nIf you are looking for a better night's sleep and don't want to break your wallet then the 3.3 Cloud9 Memory Foam Mattress Topper is the perfect choice! I highly recommend it!;Cloud 9 = Heavenly Sleep!
375;394.0;5.0;7.0;What can I say more.  It is wonderful and quite comfortable.  I would recommend it highly and am happy with the purchase.;Love this Foam Mattress
376;395.0;5.0;7.0;I had a pillow top mattress that was only 1 sided and I turned it once a month, however it had a hole it the middle so I hated the mattress, so I got rid of it and then sold the bed in my guest room and put that mattress on my bed.  It looked funny because it was too low, very old mattress but never used.  I orderd the 3.3 Cloud( memory foam mattress topper and I love it.  I sleep better it's so comfortable and no sign of any sagging as of yet.  I would recommend this to anyone.;3.3 Cloud memory foam mattress
377;396.0;5.0;7.0;This foam topper arrived on time for my desperate situation of trying to make a sofabed more comfortable.  It made the difference between comfortable and wanting to set the sofa on fire.  It wasn't smelly when I opened the package like some products of this sort can be, and it quickly filled out.  It was the correct size.  This is my first experience with foam mattress toppers, so maybe I'm not expecting too much, but it makes a world of difference to me, and I heartily recommend it.;totally worth it
378;397.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this instead of a new mattress and it was the best purchase I made this year.  So comfortable!!;So worth the money!!
380;398.0;5.0;7.0;This is a great product for the price. We bought two of these and use them in our guest bed room at the cabin and everyone had told us how much better the beds are now. I do not recommend trimming the pad because when you put the sheets on it will form to the mattress.;Great buy for the price
381;399.0;5.0;7.0;It's worth the money I paid. There was no smell to it and it makes sleeping a lot more enjoyable.;It feels amazing
382;400.0;5.0;7.0;"I have read other reviews saying that weight and height of the person using this plays an important role in how this performs; with that being said, I amd 6'2"" tall and weigh about 170lbs.\nI'm away at school, and have a somewhat dated mattress that I am using, this mattress topper made it so I can actually sleep decently again!\nI was having terrible hip pain, as I am a side sleeper, and I knew it was from my mattress. I have a very expensive mattress back at home to compare this to. Not quite the same feel as what I am used to back home, still gives a great sleep.";Great product
383;401.0;5.0;7.0;"I was shocked at the cheap price!  Given, it doesn't feel like 100% memory foam, but it feels pretty damn close.  Sleeping on my side is MUCH more comfortable now.  I really wish I made this purchase earlier.\n\nCons:  None really.  This thing was cheaper than any topper I""ve seen previously.  No smell to mention.  I suppose the picture is a little misleading as the mattress topper does not hold imprints as the pic suggests...well, maybe in the pic was taken in a micro second.\n\nPros.  CHEAP!  Comfy!  This is for those wanting a softer feel.  You some-what sink into this thing.  It is comfy as hell.  My bed has a new amazing feel I didn't expect from a topper.  I now wonder if the investment of a memory foam mattress is even worth it considering the feel difference from this topper.\n\nJust buy it.  Worse case scenario?  You put it in the guest bedroom.  I am pretty confident you won't want to give it up, however.";Just like everyone says.  Love it!
384;402.0;5.0;7.0;will today my sister call and we have order her 3.3CLOUDmemory foam mattress too and she slept great and so have I  thanks for saving us lots of money THANK YOU;THANK U
385;403.0;5.0;7.0;The Cloud9 has made a super comfortable bed out of an old uncomfortable mattress!!\nI was surprised how light weight it is & yet it has really great support!;Super Comfy with great support!!
386;404.0;4.0;7.0;Insomnia sufferer for 15yrs this mattress pad has helped tremendously!  I was ready to purchase an expensive mattress but heard people were having success with these.  I gave it four stars because if the awkward fit.  Deep sheets still work but Slide off sti.  i haven't tried cutting down edges.;Restless sleep solution
387;405.0;5.0;7.0;My topper was sold at a significant discount so I was not sure what I was going to get.  When it arrived (in less than 3 days), I was thrilled at the quality.  I cannot say enough good things about the improvement the topper made in the comfort of my bed, and at a fraction of the price of other toppers of similar size and quality.;Mattress topper is great
388;406.0;5.0;7.0;I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try. I purchased this mattress topper for my super uncomfortable futon bed that is incredibly hard and has no cushion... I love sleeping on it now. It is super cushiony without flattening and I'm about 5'3 110llbs. I sink into it just enough and I feel like i'm sleeping on a really expensive mattress now. It's amazing, I highly recommend this one!!;My uncomfortable futon feels like a real bed now!
389;407.0;4.0;7.0;It's pretty good. A bit different from the ones I've gotten before. Did fluff up after being let out of the box. Got here quick.;Good
391;408.0;5.0;7.0;This matress topper is perfect for my needs. It was delivered within days of ordering. I left it out for a day before I used it and the chemical smell was completely gone. For under $50 with free shipping, you couldn't beat a better deal. I would highly recommend this topper for those looking for high quality, cost effective topper.;Perfect!!!
392;409.0;5.0;7.0;"I had no problem with my bed when I first bought this.  I have a full size bed, and a full size futon.  The pad on the futon was worn, which triggered me to think about buying something to pad it up.  I ended up getting this one.  I opened it up on the day it arrived to ""air out"" the smell, and surprisingly there wasn't much smell to begin with.  After a day or two I placed it onto my bed.  At first it feels a little weird, but not for a single night since then I had any issue with my bed.  It feels really great to sleep ""in"" your bed.  3 in is kind of thick, which stretches my fitted sheet to almost its limit, but the good news is it still fits.  I had worry about whether having heating pads over it might be a problem, but it wasn't.  Definitely one of the best investment on my beddings.";Easy way to improve your bed
393;410.0;5.0;7.0;awesome topper for a mattress that was reasonably priced I would recommend this product to everyone. great purchase not really as shown in picture no impression is made but still very comfortable for the price.;great purchase
394;411.0;4.0;7.0;didnt reallize would be hard to manuever  to move around, cover, but otherwise very comfortable  hope it stays in placae;very good product,  very comfortable for my daughter
395;412.0;5.0;7.0;just got it in full, its a fat white memory foam mattress topper. Great value that's for sure it comfortable and you can sink into it. I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. Great boost for your bed and good support for your body!!! GOOD SHIPPING;its a good bargain and fat!!!
397;413.0;5.0;7.0;I put this on top of an old mattress and its like heavan now! I was able to put it on my bed the moment I got it and there was no smell or waiting 24hrs like other toppers. Would definitely buy again!;Great comfort
399;414.0;5.0;7.0;I ordered it with lower expectations. All the other memory foam pads were so much more expensive. We bought one for our camper and one to make replacement cushion for a sun-room lounge chair. Perfect!;Excellent price!
400;415.0;5.0;7.0;this product is just what I needed to correct my lower back troubles. Every part of my body rests evenly.  THANKS;dreamy
401;416.0;4.0;7.0;Ordered this for my Son's full size bed and he loves it.  Received it quickly and they even follow up with you to make sure you received it and everything is a-ok.  Thank you!;Comfy
405;417.0;5.0;7.0;My son has had his bed now for 5 years and we know we are going to move soon but his bed was getting really hard and it was time to get a new one but Id rather not have to move with it SO we opted to try this and its like a new bed! He is very pleased and I am so glad that all we will do is take this instead of an entire bed and he can add it to a new bed to make it even better. It is NOT hot like we worried about and SO easy to deal with. Its amazing how they can scruntch that whole thing into a box like that but they did and it was exactly as advertised and I got it 10 dollars cheaper than when I was first looking at it so I cant complain at all! I HIGHLY reccommend it.;Everything we hoped it would be.
407;418.0;5.0;7.0;This product is awesome.. I even debated to buy 2 of them just to make sure they would suffice.. but just going with 1 was great. No more back soreness, especially days after training back in the gym.;No more back soreness!
408;419.0;4.0;7.0;this topper was perfect for helping revive our current mattress! very comfortable and supports yo prett much throughout the night.;works great!
409;420.0;5.0;7.0;I have been looking for an economical solution to my ancient mattress for about 6 months, short of replacing the entire thing. This product was perfect in every way. It is a full 3 inches which took the day to decompress and it is a great price at 49.99 (+ no shipping !), and a true memory foam product.;great product
410;421.0;5.0;7.0;I love the Memory foam. My husband has had back surgery and he has to watch what he sleeps on. We both get up in the morning with no pain from pressure points.;Great Memory Foam My husband and I love it
411;422.0;5.0;7.0;I did hope it had a cover but no biggie. The first night I thought I made a mistake but a week into it my body doesnt hurt anywhere as bad as it ususlly does\nIt is very comfortable and I have been sleeping GREAT! I would buy another any time!;my body loves it!
413;423.0;4.0;7.0;Overall it is very comfortable. My one complaint is it is not quite the size of my mattress with makes it awkward when two people are sleeping on it. I'm not sure if that's just how they come or if mine was just weird..other than that I like it and would recommend it;Super fast shipping
414;424.0;5.0;7.0;Very soft! i LOVE this foam mattress! it fits well with a full sized bed and its very soft. I love it so much!;so SOOOFT!
415;425.0;5.0;7.0;Just received my mattress pad after ordering it just 3 days ago and it is perfect. I already cannot wait to go to sleep tonight. Very happy I bought this. It saved me almost $350! I highly recommend this.;You won't regret it.
417;426.0;5.0;7.0;Product is really thick conforms to your body for a good night sleep. Highly recommended over egg crate or thinner mattress pads.;Never sleep without one
418;427.0;5.0;7.0;This was sent to me in MINT condition. The mattress topper is of excellent quality and was perfect for our camping trip. Not too hard and not too soft. Great job.;Excellent
419;428.0;5.0;7.0;First, the shipping was incredibly fast from Cloud9 Bedding, so I definitely recommend them. I have a full size bed and it's a little big, which is fine by me. I'd rather it be too big than too small. I haven't trimmed it yet, but from the other reviews and after looking at the material itself, I don't think that will be very difficult. My favorite thing is that I've had it on the bed for a few nights now, and it stays in place perfectly. I was afraid it would slide around on the bed, but it doesn't at all. It's very soft, like sleeping on a marshmallow. It makes me want to stay in bed all day :);LOVE IT :D
420;429.0;5.0;7.0;This is just what was advertised and is quite comfortable. I cut it to fit a single bed with no problem, and had some extra to make a dog bed.;3.3 cloud9 memory foam
421;430.0;4.0;7.0;we bought the mattress for our van.  we use it for camping and it worked very well.  we both slept great!;compfortable
424;431.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this for my daughter and everyone wants to sleep in her bed now.  This a very stong / sturdy pad.  Not like the store memory foam toppers at all.  I am overly pleased and ordered more for other rooms.  Shipping was quick and I am a very happy mother!  :);BEst bed topper ever!
425;432.0;5.0;7.0;I have been dealing with back troubles for many years, I was looking for a reasonable solution to my on going problem. A few years ago I bought yet another mattress in hope of some relief and still very little results. I looked on Amazon for some type of pad and started seeing a lot of great reviews on the memory foam pads. Of course as the economy influences our buying sometimes I was looking for something reasonable. I saw these pads that were priced right and I went to the reviews and there were so many positive comments that it convinced me to buy this Cloud 9 pad. I got it within a few days and opened it and put it on my bed, gave it some time to get into shape after shipping. It was a bit over sized for my bed but all I did was use a tape measure and matched it to my mattress and marked it and cut it with a good scissors and it was perfect. I figured I was going for broke so I slept flat on my back which is asking for trouble and I slept great, no lower back pain at all when I got up. Great pad for the money and if your suffering with back trouble you will really like how you feel in the morning.;nice sensible solution for back pain
426;433.0;5.0;7.0;I got this for my son and he longer complains about sleeping in his own bed.  Very comfortable and I would recommend.;Very Happy
428;434.0;4.0;7.0;i ordered a topper and when it came i was not satisfied with it ,contacted spruce it up  and not only did they replace the topper they also offered me a patial refund on the purchase price.so far the new topper seems great and i can't say enough good things about their customer service ,they went above and beyond to make me happy and kept in touch with me the whole time they also offered pre paid return shipping and instructions on how to shrink down and ship the old topper which isn't as bad as it seems if you follow the directions.they are a great company to do business with and i would not hesitate to do business with them again.best customer service i have ever dealt with.;great customer service
430;435.0;5.0;7.0;I placed it on top of a mattress that was stiff and uncomfortable. Now I don't even notice that. I can fall asleep so much better after adding the memory foam.;My Memory Foam Mattress Topper
431;436.0;5.0;7.0;its so soft its hard to get out of bed in the morning the other reviews were right on the money this mattress topper is perfect.;soft just right
432;437.0;5.0;7.0;The Cloud 9 gives a great night's sleep.\nThe Cloud 9 saved us from the expense of a new mattress, and gave us all the comfort of a new mattress.;Greatly improved comfort
434;438.0;4.0;7.0;I originally bought this to use on a futon I was sleeping on for a few weeks.  It made it a little more comfortable but I wasn't 100% (not that I expected to be with the bars of the futon base on my back).  I moved it to my mattress and it is like sleeping on a cloud.  I love it! Not too soft and the memory foam really does conform to you.;very comfortable
436;439.0;5.0;7.0;When I received this I was unsure because they fold the foam to package it. When I laid it out on the bed it had large creases in it. It took roughly 30 minutes and it was completely flat. The quality is great and I like that it's a little thicker than a lot of them you can buy. Very comfy!;Good quality
442;440.0;5.0;7.0;What a difference in the way I rest every night! The memory foam supports my back and I don't wake up sore and stiff like I used to before I got it. I high recommend this product!;Love My Memory Foam
150;441.0;1.0;6.0;foam was much less dense than expected. thought from the positive reviews that the pad would be better quality. it collapses easily under weight so doesn't feel the same as a true memory foam. packaging was just vacuum sealed in plastic bag and shoved in a brown shipping box. Don't buy for a gift! wish i hadn't bought it.;Not as high quality as expected for this price.
444;442.0;5.0;7.0;"After reading all the reviews on this product I decided to take the plunge on this memory foam topper; all I can say is I am sorry I did not do it sooner. I sustained a back injury 2 years ago on the job and really haven't had a good nights sleep since. I ordered it on a Monday and it was here by Friday. Wow! Now thats customer service. I let it expand for 24 hours and then added it to the bed. I layered the bed like a sandwich, first came the 1 1/2inch skinny foam pad, then the Cloud 9 and finally my down feather bed ( you need a deep pocket mattress cover and fitted sheet to do this right) and was ready to give it a shot later that night. ZZZZZZZZZZ, slept like a baby. No tossing and turning or uncomfortable pressure points. First restful night of sleep since the injury and surgery. I got up in the morning feeling good and not like a 90 year old who had been run over by a truck and hit with a large piece of lumber. I am sold on the Cloud 9. You can not beat the price, it is well made and does everything it says. I am pleased with this purchase. I am not the only one in the house who likes it; the cat has now become a bed hog. Imagine that??I say order this if you are on the fence, it is worth every penny and more. I now sleep like an angel on my Cloud 9. Nothing beats a peaceful nights sleep when you have chronic pain. Yeah,I feel human again, who would have thought the addition of a memory foam topper would make such a difference? It does,enough said think I need a nap now. Kidding! Buy this you won't be sorry.";Great Value, oh so comfy
445;443.0;5.0;7.0;the product name really describes it. it's like sleeping on clouds. the price was good too. after using this i can't sleep on a normal bed anymore.;awesome
446;444.0;5.0;7.0;Bought this for my 6 year old's bed, her mattress was like a rock and couldn't afford a new one. It's now like sleeping on a cloud!! I don't know why anyone were not give this 5 stars. Definately worth every penny and then some!!!;Mattress Topper
179;445.0;3.0;6.0;Bought this item for my mattress and for the first 5 months, it was great. It was soft and made my mattress much more comfortable. Then it started to develop and dip in the middle. It got so bad, I had to remove it. Great product at first, but quickly became unusable.;It was great for the first 5 months!
180;446.0;5.0;6.0;this saved me from having to get a new mattress, very nice quality and very comfortable.  It is money well spent;no more ache back
8;447.0;4.0;5.0;The cloud 9 memory foam mattress topper came in only a couple of days from ordering.  Its generous size covered the entire mattress and is quite comfortable.  However, it took me a few nights to get used to sleeping on memory foam. It now gives me a good night's sleep. I am an older person with constant back and hip pain which the Cloud 9 seems to relieve when sleeping.;Its generous size covered the entire mattress and is quite comfortable. However
281;448.0;5.0;6.0;"or at least how I imagine it would feel to sleep on a cloud =;-)  And nice price!  Guess there aren't many full-size beds 'round here anymore...";It's like sleeping on a cloud...
14;449.0;5.0;5.0;I've never slept better in my life. Best money (my mom) ever spent on me. I'm in college and I have so much going on and at the end of the day I couldn't be more excited to lay in my bed and sleep. Heck! I even started taking naps occasionally and if you know me then you know I'm not a nap person what's so ever. just buy it. You won't regret it.;I may go sleep right now talking about it.
303;450.0;5.0;6.0;Good quality!\nIt works beautifully on my futon.  The foam mattress makes a hard bed into a place for a comfortable night's restful sleep.;Cloud9 is really great!
321;451.0;5.0;6.0;Bought as a topper and now my entire family wants one after spending one night while visiting. Just reorder 2 more...Worth the price in dreams...;Over an hard mattress

379;453.0;5.0;6.0;Bought this to cover an uncomfortable dorm mattress. It has made the bed much more comfortable. So much better than buying a whole new mattress.;great buy
390;454.0;1.0;6.0;"The photo showing the ""memory"" foam is a bit of an exaggeration. Not much more than just a piece of foam you could buy at a craft store. Because of the outstanding reviews, we cut it to fit before sleeping on it. What a mistake! We wish we could send it back as it adds nothing to the sleep experience and just makes it difficult to change the sheets. All we ended up with is a bulky piece of foam. Maybe we can make a few dog beds.";Not worth it

189;456.0;2.0;5.0;"I purchased the 3"" full pad and found that although it responds like memory foam it is not very dense or heavy. I had previously purchased a Queen Size 2"" Brand name memory foam pad from another retailer and found the foam to be very dense and twice as heavy as the Cloud9 3"". The Cloud9 was purchased to place on a sofa bed that came with a very thin mattress and canvass support which was very uncomfortable. The Cloud9 was OK but not what was expected. For a 3"" memory foam it had to much give and you can still feel the hard canvass support below. Persons sleeping on the foam pad only weighed about 150 pounds. Maybe the 4"" would have worked better but if it was made of the same material the thickness would have made little difference. It may be called memory foam and does bounce back after an imprint but I found the quality was just not there. Good quality memory foam is very dense and very heavy.";Very Dense it is Not
238;457.0;3.0;5.0;I enjoyed the quality of this mattress topper as it first arrived. I had been searching for something to relive my back pain. After a week of having it on my bed, I realized it was causing me more pain than anything. The foam was too thick and making me sink so that I wasn't able to move around at night. It's a shame! The quality of the product is great, but I should have ordered a 1.5 or 2 inch instead.;try before you buy
296;458.0;1.0;5.0;thin and cheap. In this instance you get what you paid for. It was not much so I guess I can't complain;did not like this product
343;459.0;1.0;5.0;This product is made of polyurethane and is highly flammable.\nI have no idea how products like this are allowed to be sold for use on people's beds...\nThis product is no worse than any other of these type mattress toppers...;highly dangerous product

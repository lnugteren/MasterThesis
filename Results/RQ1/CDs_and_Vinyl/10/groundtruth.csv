2;1.0;1.0;6.0;"I put this DVD in the player, got about half way through the first song (No More Tears), got frustrated and ejected it.  First of all, the camera work looks like it's being handled by a ferret on crank.  That kind of camera work irritates me to no end.  I just want to watch the band play.  I don't need a simulated Clocwork Orange"" re-education experience.  Then I noticed that, every time the camera angle changed, Ozzy and the band were wearing different clothes, or Ozzy's hair was different or his lips didn't match the sound.  Guess what - the video isn't even real.  It's apparently a bunch of different concert footage superimposed on the audio from one show.  What a rip-off.""";Don't waste your money
6;2.0;1.0;36.0;"I LOVE Ozzy Osbourne. He is awesome live. He has one of the best stage presences in metal. But this DVD is not a real concert. What this is the music from the Live and Loud CD played in the background played over a bunch of crappy video footage. Half of it doesn't even belong here. The music is great,but the video footage is what messes this up. If you want a real Ozzy concert,buy Live At Budokan"".If you want to get the REAL concert this was taken from,buy the CD.Also,The DVD does NOT have instant chapter access like the case says so. Plus,the DVD is two sided. This means that you have to flip it over in the middle of the concert.""";Terrible DVD!
0;3.0;2.0;29.0;"i really love the sound of ozzy since the days of BS. it was even better together with randy and then the the time together with zakk - it was great - live & loud is one of the best albums ever ... BUT !!!\nwho the hell is the editor of this video ?\ni want to see zakk mistreating his guitar - but what do you see in this video. one cut per second. in one guitar solo,  you see zakk with 3 different guitars, ozzy pulling water on the crowd, ozzy with pony-hair, ozzy with a shirt, ozzy half-naked, 2 times michael, and randy playing another song ... - AND EVERYTHING IN JUST ONE 15s - GUITAR SOLO !!!\ntechnical this dvd is also diappointing: 2 sides - turn around at halftime - like old vinyl. no subtitels to sing along for newbees.\ni really like the way ACDCs no bull"" is made. the concert without any trash. you can see angus and his gibson and brian talking to the crowd. just one concert at a beautiful arena. you can hear it as often you want without getting bored of interviews. the interviews are on a second track on the dvd. that is the way it should be.""";great music !
8;4.0;2.0;11.0;I'll keep this short and sweet....\nI bought this DVD expecting to see a legend at work in a LIVE concert.  This DVD was nothing more than a 110 minute music video.  I am above all else a big guitar fan and there were NO good close ups of Zakk's guitar solos.  The few times you did get a glimpse of him playing, it was totally out of sync with the music!  Absolutely the worst editing I've ever seen.  I cannot believe this DVD was marketed as a compilation of live songs.  Save your money people!!!;Major Disappointment
4;5.0;1.0;6.0;This is the worst live DVD concert I've ever seen.  What were the producers thinking.  I love Ozzy Osbourne but you can't appreciate his music and talent on this DVD.  I'm extremely dissapointed with the presentation, effects, and music quality on this DVD.  To me, this is not a live concert DVD, it's more of a multi-clip camara Video put together over the original live music and the effects are terrible.  I thought I was going to see a live ozzy concert but it was like videos with bad effects.  I don't know what they let people mislead customers into buying crap.;Horrible
3;6.0;1.0;5.0;"Until a DVD is released with footage from the Randy Rhodes era I could care less about ANYTHING else that's released on OZZY. There may be a good song here and there (& not to bash Zack, Jake E. & whoever else) but to me Ozzy without Randy is irrelevant. This, of course, excludes Sabbath. I have a VHS of the After Hours show"", excellent video but only mono sound, so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it. I also have several bootleg concert VHSs and in at least one of them (Japan - Budokan I think) professional cameras can be seen. So the footage is out there.\n\nOzzy...what's the problem??""";No Randy available so who cares.
5;7.0;3.0;5.0;"I would agree with most of the other reviewers, the footage is crappy (especially Paraniod""). The bottom line is this is Ozzy and anything from him is good. The disc is double sided and it does actually have a menu and instant track access ( on my remote I just press the menu button while the disc is playing). The best song/footage on here is ""Black Sabbath"", but it's still bad. I usually put the disc in, switch the TV off and enjoy the music. It gets 3 stars only because Ozzy is on here. Die hard Ozzy fans can ""waste"" their money (like me), otherwise- DON'T BUY!!!!!!!""";Great music, but.........

9;9.0;5.0;5.0;You can't get much better than this. Ozzy has always been the GOD of Rock~N~Roll...and this DVD proves it!!! I've watched it at least a dozen times, ...!!! I just can't get enough of OZZY, and after you see this concert, nither will you! It has everything: Mr. Crowley, Changes, War Pigs, No More Tears..and so much ... more. Plus!!! Black Sabbath singing their title song!!! Don't miss this one!\nOZZY RULES!!!!;Best DVD EVER!!!!
1;10.0;2.0;6.0;I wouldn't call this a live concert, but rather a collection of individual videos using multiple live performances.  Rarely did what you saw on screen match what was being heard.  Don't buy this expecting to see a good live  show.  Also, the DVD is 2 sided for a video that's less than 2 hours,  meaning that you have to flip it over halfway through it.  I was expecting  a lot more than this.;Video Collection

2;1.0;1.0;7.0;He reminds me of a bufflao wing that Ruben Studdard ate the meat off of and threw in the garbage.;This dude is REALLY sad.
1;2.0;1.0;6.0;This disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs, heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...Corey's voice is below average....I get the feeling that Corey Clark is IMITATING a good singer with a VIABLE career, and not doing it very well....clearly 'fake it till you make it' isn't working here.  The songs all sound the same, I kept waiting for something to get me grooving, but it just didn't happen.\n\nI think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons, a little humility, and some professional grooming (and I don't mean clothing).;Simply AWFUL!
3;3.0;1.0;23.0;"I would just like to clear up something right away: I am not a Corey Clark hater. Although it's clear that he took the wrong approach in announcing the Paula Abdul situation, I really don't care whether or not he actually had relations with her (although the song about it, ""Paulatics"", is quite embarrassing -- for him, not Paula). All I care about is whether or not the music is good, and Corey's self-titled album proves that the music is indeed NOT.\n\nThe main problem with this album is, point blank, Corey cannot sing. In fact, the only song that's even tolerable on here is the very last one, ""Bed of Roses"". And except for that song and ""Look What You've Done to Me"" (a clumsy tribute to Beyonc&eacute;), everything on the album is about sex, and the lyrics are even stupider than the lyrics on R. Kelly's TP.3 Reloaded. Check ""Out of Control"", a song that made it obvious that Corey should never be allowed to write an entire song by himself again.\n\nMost of the songs are pretty terrible, but lyrics especially fail in songs like ""Cherry On Top"", which has the chorus: ""Ooh, like a cherry on top/Put your body on top of mine."" There's also ""Truthfully"", which begins with ""I want to be a part of your clothing/Preferably your G-string."" (Seriously, ladies, would that turn any of y'all on?) And even when songs appear to be going well, they don't. ""So Many Questions"" crashes and burns beginning at the second verse, and the only saving grace to ""Follow That Back"" is a rap by Christopher ""Kid"" Reid (yes, you read that right).\n\nNot even the remake of DeBarge's ""All This Love"" can save Corey Clark. People know who he is now, true, but this album is so terrible that it won't be long before it finds itself in the bargain bin along with Frankee and Young Rome's albums.\n\nAnthony Rupert";1-1/2 stars -- Flop goes the weasel
65;4.0;4.0;16.0;I have been an avid fan of american idol since day one. I love Paula, Simon and Randy. I really didn't want to listen or hear about Corey Clark, I was just sick of the publicity he was getting. Finally I was convinced to at least listen to his cd. I thought that I would probably not even get through the first song before I would want to turn it off. I have got to tell you that I was wrong wrong wrong wrong. He really does have a class act. Even if you don't like him. If you are a true music lover and not just a hater trying to discredit Corey, then you will have to admit that he's got it going on. I did end up buying it and I would reccommend it to anyone who wants to hear good music.;Talk about  a class act!
6;5.0;1.0;10.0;This guy is a complete joke.  Don't buy into the hype of that snoozefest American Idol.  Support real talent.;Avoid like the plague
80;6.0;1.0;16.0;"No one can deny that Clark had a good voice on American Idol.  He still has a good voice, with its flaws, which show on this album.  That is the positive aspect of of his self titled album COREY CLARK.\n\nCOREY CLARK is an uninspired album anyway that you look at it.  The first flaw that you notice from the very first track is that it way overproduced.  The production is too slick and it just grates on you.  Everything is synth based, which is alright if you work synth-based production the right way, but in this case, you would hope that an acoustic track might appear. True, it is a dance/teen pop album, but it is tiring because the synths are too ""draining"".\n\nThe next flaw is the fact that Clark does drabble in many influences.  Normally that is a positive thing, but in this case, it doesn't always work or sound unified.  On ""Paulatics"", Clark sounds like Michael Jackson singing on an N'Sync or Backstreet Boys song. There's nothing wrong with sounding like Michael, but teen pop is already in a dying breed and an album like COREY CLARK sets it back further because it isn't anything that hasn't already been done or already heard.  It is so undistinguished that it could never stand out among much better modern dance-pop/teen acts (Ciara, Jo Jo, etc...).  Against Michael Jackson or any of the boy bands for the most part it doesn't stand a chance.  Furthermore, against his main competition Justin Timberlake, Usher, even Mario, Omarion, Marques Houston, etc... it doesn't even compare.\n\nAs I stated earlier, Corey Clark has a good voice, yet it has flaws.  It grows annoying in general over the overabundance of dance-pop, synth-based tunes.  His upper register (as noted on American Idol) grows sometimes a bit overdramatic and over powered, sometimes where it sounds like he overshoots or screams.  As a musician myself, you have to learn not to ""power"" everything and not to overdo singing, which is incredibly easy to do.\n\nThe most listenable tunes are ""Out of Control"" and ""Paulatics"".  Otherwise, Clark drabbles too much in uninspired teen pop tunes that just have no substance and prove too repetitive and too based upon the production rather than the vocalist.  This is by far one of the worst ""American Idol"" albums released.  If it sells well, I will be shocked.  If you are the least bit interested, I suggest downloading the two above mentioned songs rather than buy the full album itself. 1 star.";Overproduced and honestly...tired
64;7.0;5.0;15.0;I at times find myself wondering about todays music. Where is it going? How do we define what is good and what is not? This young man has just answered that question without a doubt! This is and I am sure will be one of the biggest selling cds that has come on the market in a long time. It has something for everyone. Dance, ballads and smooth easy listening music. The vocals are incredible. The harmonies are outstanding. I will and am recommending this to everyone I know. Way to go Corey Clark!;Passion and Commitment
90;8.0;2.0;15.0;"If you wanna make it all about the music and ignore the person behind it, feel free. A lot of people can't do that. Corey was the one who brought up all the stuff about Paula, who put ""Paulatics"" on the album and won't freakin shut up about her. He could have tried to sell the album on talent alone, but he didn't have the guts. Instead he went around telling people he banged Paula Abdul, smearing it everywhere in graphic detail, revelling in telling every dirty little detail to anyone who'd listen. Paula wasn't ever the world's greatest singer, but she got her eight Number One singles all on her own merits. Corey will never be able to say the same. He's not an artist I could ever respect or admire. Helping him get rich by buying his album isn't something I have the slightest inclination to do.";Music is an expression of who you are - and Corey's scum
91;9.0;5.0;15.0;"<writing this under my mom's user name>\n\nI hate to be mean,but this needs to be said.\n\nOk, I don't have the cd yet,but I have heard the songs(I will get a copy) and I think they are so far so good. Heck half of you who are writing these bad reviews don't even have the cd and haven't even listened to any of the songs. Then if you do listen to the songs, you go into it with your mind already made up that you don't like the guy so you don't give him a chance.\n\nI don't like alot of artists,but that doesn't mean they can't put out good music. This boy reminds me of El Debarge. Yes, there are some songs(2 songs)on here that I don't care for,but I gave him 5 stars because alot of you are just being salty. You're still hung up over this ""Paula is a victim"" situation.\n\nFirst of all,if you think Corey can't sing why the heck would you even listen to the clips or buy the cd anyways?If you are sick of this guy then bye bye. There are so many people in the music industry that use controversy to sell a product. I happen to think he told that story for some other reason,but half of you are so stuck on Paula's Squeaky clean I can do no wrong ""image"" on american idol that you can't look at the real reasons why he told the story. If you think he told the story to get attention...well he did a good job because the ones who don't like him are still paying him attention by writing bad reviews based on something else rather than the music. Yes he got your attention because you are the ones that watch his interviews on tv,talk about him on message boards,and read articles about him. You are the ones keeping his face out there.no one is twisting your arms to buy his cd. You don't like him than go buy a Paula record. Paula fans go listen to screech on her cds. Go help her make a comeback lol.\n\nI'm sorry I went off in this review,but somethings just need to be said.";Some of you need to get over it!!!
62;10.0;5.0;14.0;It's about time that people started to get back to real music. This guy is for real. He is not just a fly by night artist. I have been an avid fan of American Idle. I realize that there are a lot of people that are against this cd because of the media spin on this. Well they need to wake up and smell the music because this will be the cd of the decade. The music is tight the vocals are outstanding. I am recommending this to everyone! When will the next cd be out?;What are you waiting for!
63;11.0;5.0;14.0;I have yet to skip a song on this cd. Usually there are a few that you just don't care for. I must admit that I thought there would be a few. Well I'm here to tell you that I'm still listening to it as we speak. I haven't tired of any. This cd is wearing my cd player out. I especially love Out of Control! WOW!;Bumpin to the music
7;12.0;1.0;11.0;Some here have complained about his voice being drowned out by the production..  That's a good thing because I left my cd that was given to me playing and came back to find my cat having convulsions on the floor!!  Plugging my ears, I made my way to the basement to shut off the breakers because I couldn't even go close to the speakers.  Had his voice been louder who knows what could have happened.  Corey sounds like a 14 year old girl on male hormones drowned out by noise.  The music production sounded like they hired a bunch of wannabe producers instead of professionals.  Notes out of place, beats out of time.  Unbelievable!  This is one of the worst singing/music productions I've heard in a long time.  I did find the CD saved me a trip outside to knock down this large weed.  My window was opened and it sailed like a frisbee and cut the sucker right down.  Well, actually the stalk bent.  I just left it there...  This was meant to be a quick buck.  Save your money for something better!;Worst, Sound-In-A-Blender I've heard in a long time
78;13.0;1.0;14.0;Honestly, I bought this CD mostly because of the amount of airtime he's received on TV recently. I don't really care about the Abdul thing, whether it's true or not, it's impossible to really tell. But, I bought this just to see if Corey actually has the talent to back up his TV coverage. He doesn't. This album is horrible, and every song feels like it's either ripping off another song entirely or it's meant for filler. For someone to take that long to release an album filled with garbage...it's very interesting.\n\nBasically, after listening to Corey's debut, I can say that whether he slept with Abdul or not, he's talentless and it doesn't really matter. Paula was crazy if she actually thought he was good. I'd say skip this album and go back to listening to your other stuff, because Corey most likely ripped it off already. Only one question really remains: who in their right mind signed this brat?;Not a good debut for Corey Clark...
4;14.0;1.0;6.0;If the ratings would go down to zero that is what this CD should have gotten. The people that liked this CD must have a build up of ear wax in their ears . This is without a doubt the worst colection of songs I have ever heard on one CD.;"Rated ""0"""
61;15.0;5.0;13.0;I had just about given up on new artist that come out with a cd. It seems that just about anyone can do it. Then along came this one. I was floored. Where has this guy been? Whos been keeping him a secret? The music flows, the vocals are strong, the harmonies are wonderful. If I turn on the radio, most new artist sound the same. This guy is unique and you will know it is him when you here him. He has definetly been a well kept secret. I won't be suprised when this goes number one on the charts! I recommend this to everyone.;Restored Faith
72;16.0;5.0;13.0;I have got to tell you. I am really suprised at all the hate going on. If you are a true music lover it shouldn't matter who he slept with. Granted I'm sure if he had a bigger record company backing him he could have had an orchestra and what not. Considering what he has been dealing with, I am quite impressed. The lyrics are raw but refreshing. The vocals are very natural and distinguished. The songs are original and different (except of course the Debarge re-make).Even with that he made it his own. You can understand what he is singing and it is shall we say music to my ears. I am quite certain that Corey Clark will be around for a long time. I recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to good music and dance too!;Great Vocals
75;17.0;5.0;13.0;What can I say Corey has the vocal skills!  Ever since that season in American Idol I was routing for him all the way but unfortunately he got kicked off.  But in the end I don't think that really mattered because now he's doing his own thing with the likes of music producer Scott Storch who has produced big records for 50 Cent and Beyonce.  I must say this album has me very impressed every song has it's own agenda there's really good production behind this debut and Corey's vocals to match are like bread and butter.  I definetely recommend this to album to anyone that can appreciate good R&B you won't be dissapointed!!!  Notable favorites are Cherry on Top, That's My Girl, Lights Out, All This Love, Chance to Dance, So Many Questions, dang! the whole album is good!;Delightful suprise!
77;18.0;5.0;13.0;Its funny as I read the comments made on this album.  For the most part, there are a lot more positive than negative.  But for the negative comments that always end or have something to do with Corey and Paula-think about it.  Whoever judges their opinions off of these comments made are ignorant following losers.  Im not gonna say its the greates album nor its the worst. Buy it and judge for yourself. Obviously this guy has a lot of people rooting against him because of the whole Paula thing and therefore they get on here to try and convince you to not buy the c.d.  That shpws a persons character and KARMAS a bitch.  This is how this man is making a living, buy it-and see for yourself.\n\nThis c.d. is better than half the crap that is played on the radio today, with all the bling and dubs and sex...this actually has lyrics and music you can listen to and relate, but don't take my opinion, listen to it yourself.;ha!
81;19.0;5.0;13.0;I had no desire to buy this CD. None at all. I didn't care for Corey on American Idol and so I assumed I wouldn't like his CD. Fortunately I have a very pushy friend who is a huge fan.  She bought the CD for me so I gave it a shot. WOW! It is actually very good. True it is a lot of club music, but the beats are tight and I found myself dancing and humming along. This CD is far better than I expected.  I highly recommend it.;I am shocked
85;20.0;5.0;13.0;This is such a great album! An amazing and creative mix of many different genres of music. Corey's amazing, and versatile voice really stands out in every song. Definetly worth every penny!;A Great Buy!
88;21.0;4.0;13.0;"For those of us who watched the 2nd season of American Idol,you know that Corey Clark was one of the best singers in the competition. He sang the hell out of ""Foolish Heart"", ""Against All Odds"" and a few others. Seriously, if he wouldnt have gotten into legal trouble, I think he would have been in the top 3, for sure. Having enjoyed Corey's live performances so much. I went out and bought his self titled album. I was not dissappointed. This album is for those that appreciate a great voice, and not those that buy albums based on whats in the news. This guys got talent. Such a clean, clear voice. His voice reminds me of Michael Jackson a little. One of my favorite songs on the cd is ""Chance to Dance."" Great song.  Corey wrote most of the lyrics to his songs, so they are not the best lyrics in the world, but they still have meaning, and you can tell that he put some time into writing this stuff down. So go buy the album, its different and orignal, and if you give it a chance without thinking about the whole Paula situation, you'll enjoy.";Finally, a Corey Clark album!
94;22.0;4.0;13.0;I didn't think I would like the cd as much as I do. Kanye West said this guy is for real talent-wise, so I decided to give it a listen. It is a very good balance of r&b, soul, and hip-hop. He didn't have to rely so much on controversy to sell a cd. This music stands alone and is quite good. The songs have excellent vocals, nice harmonies. One of those cd's you put in the player and just dance to.;Surprising! A good listen.
35;23.0;1.0;12.0;"If you like suggestive lyrics with no substance, overproduced vocals and unimaginative instrumentation, this is the CD for you!  This CD has already tanked.....and its because most people have not been fooled by this music wannabe who needs to give it up and realize that no one gets a free ride in this life.  Is this the kind of person you want as a role model for young people today?  If this CD is any indication, we are in big, big trouble.  The CD cover alone should warn you.  If not, listen to the music....the lust filled dance tunes and the ballads with no depth or substance to them, just like the guy who is singing them.  I went to a party last night (which I wish I hadn't) and had the misfortune to listen to this hodge podge of ""screeching"" and ""bellowing"" bought by an over zealous female fan of Clark's who did everything but a striptease act to his music.  I left because I got sick to my stomach at the fact that the music world has gained nothing by allowing Mr. Clark a record deal strictly on the basis of his self-promoted immorality, which is obviously rubbing off on others.  No matter how many reviews I read here about how impressed and how wonderful this CD is, I am proud to be ONE person who has not been taken in or beguiled by the likes of someone like Corey Clark!";IS THIS THE KIND OF GUY YOU WANT AS A ROLE MODEL ?
60;24.0;5.0;12.0;This cd has got to be the best I've heard in a long time. It has hit after hit after hit. When you buy this cd ( and I recommend that you do)You won't be disappointed. You can dance all day or just mellow out to the ballads. This guy is hot hot hot. What a powerful and soulful voice. The feeling that just crys out to you in each song is incredible! I have yet to be able to pick a favorite. There are just too many good ones to choose from. I highly recommend this to everyone!;Hit CD
74;25.0;5.0;12.0;I have been listening to a lot of media on this guy. I tend to not believe the media hype. However this did peak my curiosity. I did buy it and it defintely has many hits. I predict at least 5. I wonder why I'm not hearing this on the radio. The Debarge remake is outstanding. Out of Control is just that out of control. It is definetly hot. Follow that back is jammin. Look what you've done is mellow love music. Cherry on top is great dance music. Chance to Dance is defintely a great groove jam. Wow where has this guy been. This is exactly what the industry needs right now. Fresh, clean and easy on the ears. Beautiful music. I defintely recommend.;It's a Hit
16;26.0;1.0;11.0;Corey definitley needed the press to try to sell this album. I give him credit for creating the whole fiasco with Paula to try promote this album, but I don't even think God appearing before the world telling us all to go buy this album would STILL make this album very bad. There is no substance that grabs you and attracts you to its work. There is nothing new nor creative. It is stuff that has been done in years past and done in a very poor way. I can not even give him credit as a song writer after listening to Paulatics. WOW...bad...VERY VERY bad.;WOW...Not good....but WOW VERY BAD
5;27.0;2.0;6.0;Every song on this CD seems to sound the same.  It's like 15 tracks of the exact same song writing formula.  There's a few songs that I liked, but nothing I plan to run back to anytime soon.  Corey has such a great ability with his voice - to sing in a wide range, which makes me wonder why the heck he sounds like a woman on every song.  He always had that great high register, yes, but he wasn't ONLY the high register on American Idol.  This CD is very boring.;Every song sounds the same...
79;28.0;5.0;12.0;Of course, we all know the drama surrounding this release, and if you are like me, you didn't believe the media spin against Corey on this whole story (if you read the ebook, it fills in the missing points that are actually more important than his involvement with Ms. Abdul).\n\nAside from that, this is a great album!  You can listen to it from track 1 to 15.  I like it (a 35 year old man) and my teen age niece loves it.\n\nIf you don't get this one you are missing out.;Put the drama aside...this is a quality album
83;29.0;5.0;12.0;"You sit there and say ""he has no musical talent"" because he got out there and told the truth.  You hate him because he slept with an older woman but yet you love ashton and demi, oh no wait you say because he told about the situation. He had to tell if he didn't he would have been squashed even further I understand you guys not wanting to hear details about the affair but none the less it happened and it caused him to have to deal with very large obsticles that no one should have to deal with. Nobody and not even america's beloved idol and abdul should be able to bully or black ball a person just because they know something. he wasn't telling he was trying to ignore them and they're tactless tactics for 2 years, you go with out food and a place to live because no one will sign you do to what someone else said for two years. and yes they did it because that is what all you haters are doing now, you can't make your own decision about corey and his talent because why, oh yeah paula said he is a liar he is not a person of character. what about her dating contestants,running from hit and run accidents and lying about it, knowingly sleeping with married men, I mean come on she is just as guilty as he is. you are all entitled to your opinions I just think you should make your own and stop listening to the people that want you to think what they think. I mean you guys still love R. Kelly why because he was already a star but oh corey kissing and telling about him and paula is way worse than kobey raping a woman, or r. kelly sleeping with teenage girls and peeing on them! yeah real american role model material, you only like these people because they have been in your homes already for awhile, if you don't like his music fine but don't call him a scum or a liar just because he didn't stand there and take it with out vaseline from american idol. what he did sure i can see how it would be something people don't approve of that is fine but his talent is there and you know it! to all the people saying ""oh to me as an artist my self"" or ""singer he is disgusting"" where is your american idol cd, oh yeah you don't have one, where is your record contract that you obtained, that's right you don't have one, but you know what you can obtain it if you want and I say go for it more power to you, I will definitely show you support because I unlike some others want to treat you the way i want to be treated. if you are an artist in anyway then you should already know the hardships of the business, so you should support him instead of judge him because whether it be sooner or later you will be in the same shoes he is walking in right now, might not be the same brand, but none the less it will be shoes....... I believe this album is by far original and none of the songs sound the same there is no cursing and that is golden to me i love the beats they are so original in the dance tracks they get me moving in the morning this cd is one of a kind and is definitely worth your money if you are into R&B and are in need of new music I would definitely buy this album it is definitely a show of amazing talents and the black eyed peas on there with kid from kid n play along with other very very talented people this cd is off the chains!!!!!! way to go corey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";To All Haters!
84;30.0;5.0;12.0;I have waited so long for this album! It is the best album I have heard for ages! Corey has such a fabulous voice and is so talented I hope this album paves the way to his international success. It's definitely a 5 star album buy it and you'll agree!!!;Fantastic Album Corey
89;31.0;1.0;12.0;I knew this dude was a no talent but I downloaded this cd anyway for free(Thank God) and gave it listen. All the songs sounds the same and his Lyrics are terrible. The songs wiggle and shake and Paulatics are just plain horrible. He should have worked harder on his voice and lyrics instead of getting cheap publicity. If he was really talented he would let his music do all the talking.;This Cd is Horrible
98;32.0;5.0;12.0;This is a great cd. Corey's voice is amazing, although he could have used it a little more, if there were more slow songs on the album.  Either way, this is a great album, you don't have to skip any tracks and I hope Corey does well. He deserves it.;Forget the controversy and listen to the music.
25;33.0;1.0;11.0;"I have had fun reading the reviews here.  Especially the ones written by Clark admirers who have no sense of literary style, use poor grammar and cannot spell.  These poor souls are being taken in and used by a user.  They never mention the run ins with the law that Clark has had and will attest to ""their phenomenon"" in the most glorifying, saintly ways.  Why not canonize the man?  That would draw more attention that this CD is getting.  In their delusion they believe we have an artistic work of art worth keeping here.  But this apparently is not the case because, justifiably so, the project has fallen lower than an ankle bracelet on a flat-footed pygmy.";A CD WORTH KEEPING.....APPARENTLY NOT!
27;34.0;1.0;11.0;"Keep the phony 5 star reviews coming folks.  If this CD is so great, why has it failed to chart in ANY of the charts???  Check the radio playlists.....is it on there?  No!  If it is true that Paula Abdul seduced Corey....hello???  No one is seduced unless they are allowed to be seduced.  And it does take two to tango.  Corey Clark is no saint and certainly no idol.  He's a well-known troublemaker who will take any advantage to try to get to the top.  And if these 5 star reviews are legitimate, then why has the CD been lambasted by critics and public alike.  Why is it, as one of the previous reviews have indicated that it is on sale used for #2.95???  It hasn't even been in release for a month yet and its already in the bargain bins!  Not everyone is buying into the mechanics of this fortune hunter who obviously has no respect for himself or others.  Both he and Paula Abdul deserve each other for flaunting their warped morals on a society already replete with them.  This CD would have more credibility if it were in the bounds of good taste, which it is not.  How serious can anyone take Clark seriously with songs like ""Paulatics""?  I'd have more respect for him if he had left this ""trashy"" number off of the CD.  But no, he had to get his digs in.  There was a reason he was kicked off of AI.  The charges may have been dropped, sure, but the stigma is there and Corey himself knows the truth.  That's why his CD has gone nowhere.  And to expose your children to the sex filled atrocities in the lyrics of some of these songs???  No wonder America is in such dire straits.  And a future grammy winner?  Well, people in a place where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth want ice water but that doesn't mean they're going to get it.";KEEP THE PHONY 5 STAR REVIEWS COMING!
58;35.0;5.0;11.0;This cd is incredible! If you want to hear good vocals and great dance music, this is it! I have to say that I wasn't sure. I no longer have any doubts. He has several hits on this cd from what I have heard. The music is hot the vocals are tight. I recommend this to anyone.;Phenomenal
59;36.0;5.0;11.0;What a talent. I have been in the music industry for a long time. It is so refreshing to hear real talent again. Corey's voice is unique and delightful. Each song is different. There is true talent in this young man. I can see where he will be around for a long time. I for one(among many I'm sure) recommend this cd;Superb!!!!!!
17;37.0;1.0;10.0;I was going to give Corey the benefit of the doubt after the whole American Idol thing.  But after listening, I found it to be another teeny bobber kind of CD with nothing that really moves you at all.\n\nHe should have done himself a favor and left his feelings about Paula out of the CD, it makes him look like a wuss.;Why???!!!
82;38.0;1.0;11.0;Corey Clark's CD is a complete waste of time and money.  The fact that he had to resort to making up lies and ruining peoples' reputations shows the kind of person he is and what lengths he'll go to for fame and money.  Not to mention the fact that he cannot sing and hurts my eyes. Better luck next time, kid.;A Waste of Time and Money
86;39.0;1.0;11.0;I should have known better than to waste my time on a cd by an Idol castoff/felon. Perhaps if he spent more time on the music and less time seeking cheap publicity it would have been a better effort. As a musician, it makes me cringe. The lyrics are trite, the dance tracks are overdone, his upper register on ballads is apalling.\n\nWhen i saw that he was trying to build a singing career by slagging off Paula Abdul and American Idol, rather than on the strength of his musical ability, I had a feeling that this effort would be useless.  I was right...\n\nHis 15 minutes of fame are over...time to slither back under the rock;Definintely a waste of money
87;40.0;1.0;11.0;"I'm not surprised he couldn't make it and had to use a scandal to sell anything.\n\nI doubt the American Idol people were ""on his back"" trying to ruin his career these past two years.\n\nHe just thinks too highly of his talent and of course it must have been someone's fault that he wasn't making it. This kid has serious self delusion issues about his ""talent"" and conspiracy theories.\n\nthe songs are boring. His voice is rather weak and grating at times.\n\nIn the same kinda genre, Justim Timberlake's voice is much more pleasant to the ears.\n\nCorey does sound somewhat better than he sounded on the show  though because of the studio work. He's on pitch at least. But his voice and the songs are lackluster and they sound like bad covers of songs we've already heard.";cheap music
92;41.0;5.0;11.0;In my opinion Corey Clark's debut album is a monster success.  This is easily one of the most cohesive albums I have ever purchased.  Many of the songs are dance tracks that exhibit  the artist's charm and confidence, while the ballads give us a peek at the more vulnerable side of Mr Clark.  I expect that we all will be dancing to Corey in the clubs this summer.  Terrific album!;Amazing CD
93;42.0;3.0;11.0;First off, I would actually give this cd a 3.5 out of 5. There are many good songs on this record. The only problems I have is that a few sound too similar to others. I also think he picked the worst song on the cd to start it off. I disagree with some of the reviews that Corey is simply trying to bank in on his sudden scandal news to do well. I think that Corey does have natural talent but that he went about promoting himself the wrong way and should have not let personal issues interfere with a potential musical one. I hope that he can get past this issue he has created for himself and leave it all behind.\n\nI think that people need to try to seperate Corey Clark the sometimes moronic celebrity from the gifted artist the lies within these tracks. Many of them are cleverly written.\n\nSome of the standout tracks include:\n\nCherry on Top\n\nFeelin'\n\nAll This Love\n\nWiggle & Shake\n\nBed of Roses\n\nI would give the album a shot if you can get past everything else and focus on the music. Music is about creative expression, sometimes the polotics need to be left at the door!;My Two Cents
96;43.0;1.0;11.0;"Wow, do you really want to waist your money on this liar? Yeah, Corey Clark deserves to fall off the face of the Earth. ""Fallen Idol"", hmmmm right ok, PAULA ABDUL IS FABULOUS AND COREY CLARK CAN GO DIE";Corey Clark is AWFUL
99;44.0;4.0;11.0;"This is a good CD. Not great, but not bad. Corey has a good voice, but it is not used enough on this cd, which consists of mainly dance tracks. However some slower songs like ""Bed Of Roses"" are very good. I do not think Corey should have included the track ""Paulatics"". Not because it is bad singing, but because it brings his accusations about Paula Abdul into his music, which could be a major turn-off to some listeners. Either you love Corey or hate him, but either way this CD at least deserves a chance.\n\nI recommend it.";Not bad
29;45.0;1.0;10.0;"Opportunist should have been the title of this ridiculous attempt at ""music"".  The fact that the CD has failed to chart on any chart is vindication enough.  If you don't believe me, just do a ""Corey Clark CD Sales"" search and you'll find many articles stating that this CD has bombed ""faster than you can say opportunist"".  And that is a direct quote!  For some crazy reason, a girl I work with bought this CD (I don't know where she got it because I sure haven't seen it in any of the stores) and was playing it in the office.  I gave it a listen and I realized and agree with the reviewer who posted below that these reviews are fake....probably written by members of Corey's own family.  How serious can one get on this CD with titles like ""Feenin"", ""Paulatics"" or ""With a Cherry on Top"".  The thing that bothers me is that this world is going to hell in a hand basket with people like Corey Clark being role models.  FOr heavens sake, just last month he had another felony added to his ever amounting lists of felonies for creating a disturbance at a restaraunt!  Yet this is the same guy all these ""rave reviews"" are being given to!  I don't understand it.  If you think this CD is so great, why has it failed to chart?  The reviews here represent a small scintilla of the population.  THe majority of the population has Corey Clark's number and are not being fooled.";OPPORTUNIST SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE TITLE!
34;46.0;1.0;10.0;"I've heard better music from a dog howling at the moon!  Whatever possessed me to buy this piece of junk??  Obviously I believed the ""rave"" reviews here (most of which are probably phony) and should have believed the 1 star reviews, which I agree is being too kind for this music.  I am not surprised to hear that this guy's release has sunk quicker to the bottom than any other American Idol's previous releases.  He's even doing worse than Justin Guarini which is really low and we all know how he tanked out!!  Save your money and don't make the same mistake I did.  Listen to the CD first if you can....then you'll realize what I'm talking about.  Especially the song ""Feenin""....oh gosh...Barf!!";BARF!!!
50;47.0;5.0;10.0;I have been in the industry for some 35 years. After the last ten years of rap, cursin, killin, gettin my gat, hood rats. It's finally a pleasure to hear a young man with old school backing, singing beautiful harmonies, sweet messages and dynamite lead vocal ability. I have purchased 2 copies of Corey Clarks CD and I gave one to a close friend, who continues to thank me for exposing him to such a dynomite musical adventure. Don't get me wrong I'm not putting down the rap scene, because it has been a vehicle of financial security for so many young artists. It is so refreshing to finally hear a young artists mainly Corey Clark sing, harmonize and telling love stories. It gives music a refreshing new face.\n\nP.S. Check it out for yourself.

51;48.0;5.0;10.0;Some say it's hot, some say it's not. I say it's Hot. If you listen and I mean truly listen and not judge by all the hype. You will find that this cd is has great potential. Harmonically it is some of the best I have heard in the last 10 years. He used some of the best producers that america had to offer and it shows. His lead vocal versatility is incredible. He goes from soft country pop in Bed of Roses to Mid 80's r&b Debarges All this Love and rebounds back with funk and r&b Follow that Back. I think his strongest work, Out of Control as soon as it gets enough airplay will be #1 across the nation.;Tamyra Entertainment
52;49.0;5.0;10.0;I have been looking over many of these reviews and I listened to his cd as well. What I find most comical, is that the not so good reviews are either huge Paula fans or American Idle fans. This only peaks my interest. I found Corey's cd delightful and refreshing. It does not sound like any other. It has good production. Nothing is overdone. It is a true masterpiece. Even though it is a remake I especially like All this love. It shows how versatile Corey is. I recommend this cd to those who truly enjoy good music. Even those who want to discredit Corey could take a few lessons from him.;True Music Critic
54;50.0;5.0;10.0;My first inclination when I see some of the reviews is to say that there are people that are just trying to get his ratings down. This is a serious format for people who are truly looking for good music. Take your childish and immature ways to a chat room and leave this to serious buyers. I for one enjoyed this cd. It looks as though the majority of others do as well. If you listen you will find many good songs on this cd. The music is unique and the vocals are right on. This young man has what it takes for a rising new star. I am sure that there will be many more great cds from him. I look for this to be in the top 10.;Ingenius
71;51.0;5.0;10.0;It has been many years since I have heard beautiful vocals such as Mr. Clarks. Once in a life time we have an opportunity to hear such quality in someone. You can hear and feel what he is singing. That in its self is a rare quality. I am quite sure that he will become bigger and better with age as they say. I can only wait and look forward to more great music from Corey. I for one will be standing in line to get his next cd. I highly recommend this to anyone who really wants to hear quality! Great Job Corey!;Where has he been?
41;52.0;5.0;9.0;First off, lets can the BS! The whole Paula Abdul thing.. well, no one truly knows the whole story.  And frankly, after seeing the evidence on that show, I believe him. But who cares! Paula is on AI and thats it, all she has going for her is that she is a judge and USED to be able to dance. She is an EX Laker Girl who is known for sleeping with some of the basketball players themselves... back in the 80's (yeah, she is kinda old). Paula and Corey are grown people, did anyone pay attention to that? Its called a relationship people... stop trippin! Corey's hot, wouldn't you??? And with a voice like that?!?! I say more power to Paula for seducing a younger man!\n\nAs for the CD... AMAZING!!! Off the HOOK!!! The next coming of Michael Jackson!!! Some of the tracks were kinda dated, yet Out of Control and Chance To Dance were super fresh. But Corey's voice and his songs are amazing.  I HIGHLY recommend this album...\n\nAND FOR ALL U HATERS!!! Ur just jealous that all ur chicks love Corey Clark. Corey.. good luck. Your a ROCKSTAR!!!;STOP THE RUMORS.. STOP THE HATE.. LOVE THE MUSIC
44;53.0;5.0;9.0;This cd has many great qualities. Not only is this artist talented, he has also been able to attract a lot of attention. Both positive mostly and some negative. I almost got caught up in the media hype as well. I decided to listen to the cd to see what everyone was talking about and decide for myself. I was quite impressed by Corey. For his first cd it is quite enjoyable to listen to. There are many different genres. My favorite is Bed of Roses by far. It shows that he is unique and talented not just following the common thread. Follow that Back is quite the funk tune and has captured a lot of attention on the radio as being a hit. I suggest that you forget about the negative hype, because they obviously are just Paula Abdul fans trying to make Corey look bad. It is quite obvious to anyone that is following this young man that he is on his way to stardom because of talent not because of the as we like to call them haters who think he got it done by exposing Paula. Truly a quality product and I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes variety and good music.;CD of the Decade
48;54.0;5.0;9.0;I found this cd very refreshing. It's about time a new artist stuck to their guns and created real music. While this is very commercial, I commend Corey for doing his thing. If you look inside the jacket he has either wrote or co-wrote all but one song. This is just incredible for a young man. Unheard of in the industry for a first time artist. I found Look What You've Done To Me a step back in time. That's My Girl with Sara Stokes quite colorful. Follow That Back had the old time funk that you could groove to. Bed of Roses is has that folk feel. Chance to Dance is very upbeat. Out of Control with Scott Storch producer is just that Out of Control. What a great dance tune and a good get up and move to the beat. Truthfully has a latino feel to it. Wow there are literally several songs that could go number one. The vocals are of good quality the harmonies are just outstanding. You will be missing out if you don't get this cd. I recommend this cd to everyone.;Enlightened
49;55.0;4.0;9.0;To judge this cd means to judge it only based on lyrics, beat, content, and flow. I believe for his first album he has much talent. With time he will be the bomb! I will buy this at the first chance I get. I love several of the songs on the album. When you can dig more than five songs on an album these days you got a legitimate cd. Keep doing your thing man. The cd is grooving. Can't wait for the second one.;Not bad at all
53;56.0;5.0;9.0;In mt life time there are few and far in between where you can hear an artist who can truly bring it to your heart. This artist can do that. He has genuine feelings that come across in his music. The clearity of his voice is haunting. The riffs are clear and precise. The background vocals are right on the money. I would not be suprised to see this cd hit the top 10. I for one recommend this to anyone who is serious about music;Sensational
14;57.0;1.0;8.0;"ok, first of all, i have no clue who this guy is, and i watched american idol. Second, umm, is it a boy or a girl singing? because i sure as hell cant tell...when i was listening to the samples( the only reason i heard about this guy was like a minute ago i was reading someone elses reviews and one came up about this guy,but anyways)as i was saying..i was listening to the samples and i thought that the back-up singers were singing or something..i asked myself...""when is this guy going to come on?"" and it sounded like that on every song..and i cant believe scott storch produced one of these....he is probably the hottest producer out right now and he did crap like this? wow i cant even believe there are 5 star reviews for this SH*T!! oh yeah..and to the idiots that call the people that give this one star ""haters""..there must be a jackhammer in the background or outside your house when your listening to this because ...it sucks big time..and you cant hear it because the jackhammer sounds better...and thats probably what your listening to...so stop working for the government you weak pieces of garbage..take your money and leave corey don't come back...oh wait... what money...he didn't make any money off this album..it flopped!! i give it a big fat F-";who the hell is this?
0;58.0;1.0;9.0;He is a liar and a horrible singer. He wasn't good on American Idol. If he thought he could improve CD sales by telling lies about Paula, he'd better think twice.  LIAR!;Ugh
97;59.0;5.0;9.0;Corey Clark's voice sounds amazing on this album and his track selection is great. Corey's vocals remind me of Justin Timberlake's solo-album. I love the party feel of Out of Control. This is one american idol that broke away from the goody goody mold.;Great R&B album
20;60.0;1.0;8.0;corey clark cannot sing. all the cheap publicity did not help him. he just simply cannot sing. his songs are laughfable and his cd is just a big fat joke. if you seek publicity at least have something to back it up. his 15 minutes of fame has lonf been over and his cd tanked miserably. who did he paid to give  him 5 stars reviews? please let be honest i would not recommed it to anybody.;corey clark has no talent
28;61.0;1.0;8.0;$2.95 for Corey's CD...used....here on Amazon?  No wonder, given the likes of the mediocrity displayed therein.  The reviewer below failed to mention the ruckus Corey recently caused at a restaraunt.  And if his CD has failed to chart, its because #1) His motives are apparent and indeed He is an opportunist, #2) He is not being promoted because of his reputation and because the CD is poor quality with stupid songs that only appeal to the lust-filled, oversexed crowd!  Corey's 15 minutes of fame are over!!  Accept it and move on!!;No Wonder Its On Sale for $2.95 Used
32;62.0;5.0;8.0;I feel that it is time that someone said what  needed to be said since Amazon is not able to monitor a lot of reviews. As everyone knows Corey has recieved a lot of attention. Some good and some bad. Everyone also should know that people are being paid to write bad reviews to try and destroy Corey. This is truly sad that grown people don't have anything better to do. Here is one person against a huge corporation that is standing tall and defending his rights as a human being and they don't have anything better to do? That alone should send red flags to everyone. He is not rich nor is he a big corporation. He is just one man standing tall and fighting to be heard in his music and they are trying to squash that by paying people to do so. How sad that we have sunk to this level. I myself am asking, Why? What are they worried about? This is just one person. What has he got to say that they are so afraid of? I say take a listen for yourself and truly see what you think. Not what they want you to think. Use your own judgement and then decide whether to buy it or not. That is your right. It also is his right to be able to sell his goods. That happens to be his music. He is very creative on this cd. I am sure that after I post this that someone will come along shortly and try to convince you how bad it is. Just beware that they are being paid to do that. Don't be fooled. I am simply saying, decide for yourself! I for one have been quite impressed with this cd. I can only give you my opinion, and I'm not being paid for that! Some people will like it. Some people won't. That's ok as long as it is because you decided not because your being paid to say you don't like it. Give it a listen. I don't feel that you will be disappointed, but rather you will be quite delighted. I have already purchased 2 copies. One to send to a friend!;Tellin it like it is
39;63.0;5.0;8.0;It seems to me that Corey has drawn a lot of negative publicity from AI fans and Paula Abdul fans. I think that if people would just set that aside and listen and I do mean really listen to the music and vocals, you will find that Corey is quite good. It seems to me that he has not been given a fair shake. I also don't think that his record label has properly promoted this cd. Any reputable label knows that you need to strike while the iron is hot and also get the cd on the airwaves. I am truly suprised by this label that they have failed to do so. This cd is not getting the proper rave reviews it deserves. He has been on every major network and also on a few smaller stations. That in itself should have sent this cd reeling into the top 100. This cd is very well put together. The vocals and harmonies are great. Each song is unique and pleasing to the ear. His high registor is very natural and wonderful. As Lamont Dozier stated Corey is the up and coming New Smokey Robinson! I recommend this cd to anyone that really enjoys true, creative and beautiful music and vocals!;So Impressed!
46;64.0;1.0;8.0;"""Yes I Can"" and I will give this CD only one star.  ""Truthfully"", there are ""So Many Questions"" I keep asking myself with each listen.  Why was I ""Out of Control"" when I bought this sham?  Was I just looking for a ""Chance to Dance"" and ""Wiggle and Shake"" like Clark's annoying vibrato??  I wouldn't put a ""Cherry on Top"" of this effort because it gives me a ""Feenin"" of lying on a ""Bed of Roses"" full of thorns!  Clark is obviously playing the music ""Paulatics"" game and will probably ""Follow that Back"" with ""All This Love"" his [...] ego can muster while all the time trading in on his exploitation of his alleged affair with Paula Abdul saying, ""That's My Girl"".  All I keep saying to myself is ""Look What You've Done"" since purchasing this wonderment of mediocrity.  Its time to put the ""Lights Out"" on this CD!";ONE STAR IS BEING TOO KIND FOR HIM!!
47;65.0;1.0;8.0;What an awful CD. The songs are terrible.  Are his 15 minutes up yet?;Terrible
57;66.0;1.0;8.0;"I can't understand the raves for this ""shallow"" offering from someone who obviously can't sing.  (The studio works wonders witih bad singers but it couldn't help him).  His ""girlish"" ""whirlish"" tone is aggravating and he badly misses the notes....listen to ""Cherry on Top"".  And no, I didn't spend my money on buying this piece of garbage.  I heard it playing at ""Media Play"" and asked a friend of mine who works there who it was singing so horribly....I thought it was the Chipmunks grown up at first.....\n\nSeriously though, my friend took me to the back of the store and I listened to the CD and could not believe the ""trashy"" sounds coming out of this guy's mouth.  Anyone with a shred of integrity within them should be ashamed to release something like this.  He ought to sue the producers and if he wrote the songs himself....well, I just hope he hasn't quit his day job.  This guy is a total loser and you will be wasting your money buying this product.  Zero, zero, zero stars all the way.....Now I'm going to get some excedrin to help the migraine I've got just by listening to this.  Why oh why did I do it???";WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE LISTENING TO?????
73;67.0;1.0;8.0;Someone gave me this album, I would not have bought it, but listened to it.  It is simply horrible.  I support Corey in his effort to clear the air with AI so that does not play in it- I agree with him totally on that- but this is a terrible album- why not just throw your money out the window?  That is basically what you are doing because you won't be hearing it more than twice because it is unlistenable- awful.  I am going to use the CD case as an ashtray because I hate not to get some value out of it.;A WASTE OF MONEY
76;68.0;1.0;8.0;Ok don't get my wrong Corey Clark is talented and can sing well but as mentioned above several of his tracks are overproduced and he sounds like a girl in some of them. Many of them are forgetable and some of them are incredibly inappropriate! I would recommend Justin Guarini's CD to anyone before I'd let them listen to Corey's. Don't get me wrong though Corey Clark has some talent it is just not shown on this album.;Corey Clark's debut release a FLOP!
10;69.0;1.0;7.0;Most of the five star reviews here are obviously the phony ones, written either by members of Clark himself, his family, or the people he has paid to write them.  Poor things, they can't see the forest for the trees.  But the obvious fact is, why is his CD being sold at used places like Amazon for $1.59 as many reviewers have noted here.  That is what speaks volumes.  There is no way a CD which has been out for two months could possibly be being sold at used sellers at such a price unless they're trying to get rid of them quickly.  People need to wake up and face the fact that this CD is really quite terrible and all the five star reviews in the world will never hide that fact.  Also, bashing other reviewers by name as I've seen some of these people do will do no good either.  The proof is there for all to see.  Now, I'll wait for the bashers to come after me so they can prove my point accurately.;The Used CDs will soon be on sale for .001!!
13;70.0;1.0;7.0;This CD has flopped big-time.  It has nothing to do with hate.  It is just pure fact.  Look at the amount of used CDs here on Amazon on sale for $1.58!!  What artist with a new release has used CDs going for a dollar???  That ought to confirm that this CD has been a total disaster!!  I hope this teaches Clark a lesson......don't step on people on your way up because they're the same ones you'll meet on your way down.;F- for this CD?  How about a big fat ZERO???
15;71.0;2.0;7.0;"Look, Corey Clark is an attractive guy, alright? But he's not that attractive that I'd go out and buy his album. I actually forgot that he had an album come out this summer. The other day I was listening to Paula Abdul's ""Forever Your Girl"" CD and I was like, ""Oh, yeah! Corey Clark!"" Let me tell you something: this CD is wack! There's nothing unique about it and it's boring. I thought Corey sounded great on American Idol, but on this CD it's like he's singing underneath his breath and there's no emotion. The only song I like is ""All This Love"" and that's because I love the original by El Debarge. In fact, on that song Corey sounds similar to El, but he (Corey) sounds way off key, like he was bored or something. Like I said before, Corey is hot, but I would never pay $1.40 for his CD. For $1.40 I could buy 2 bags of onion rings, Gummi Savers, and a Slim Jim! Anyway, Corey's days of getting over are finished and good looks don't last forever.";This Pretty Boy Needs to Chill and Get His Mind Together
22;72.0;1.0;7.0;I never liked him on AI, thought he sang off key, and looked like side show bob.  Then he has the nerve to try to ruin Paula &/or American Idol, to promote himself.  What a looser.  Wouldn't buy his cd - even if it was good!!!;Still a looser
26;73.0;5.0;7.0;"I once had a friend who used to say to me, you know you have made when the jealous haters come out trying to tear you down. How right that person was. How sad that some persons have to tear others down to build themself up.\n\nCorey Clark is what is commonly referred to in the industry as a ""triple threat"". He can sing he can dance he can write popular material. This point is evidenced in the fact that if you search Amazon for Corey Clark you will find him listed under POPULAR MUSIC. Popular!\n\nI will have to come back later to finish this review because as all of you have actually listened to this WHOLE album without hatred prejudice or preconceived notions, this is an incredible work of art. I am a little overwhelmed right now and simply cannot finish my review\n\nTo the haters and the Paula Abdul/Simon Cowell apologists let me just take a few moments to educate you bout the music biz. There is this concept called ""Payola"" that the Vice president just release a report about so YES it is REAL and YES it is the reason Corey Clark CD not charting YET. The Corey label is not one of great riches that can pay their Idols way to the top like some others. And at least Corey have HIS OWN CARER. So Corey have to work its way up the charts the OLD FASHION way by standing tall on the merits of the music. You see that is all Corey Clark is trying to do, sing and share his music gift to the world. He aint concerned about what this person and that person say about some graphs and charts. Corey Clark is the total package and a triple threat. That kind of up and coming phenomenon tends to scare people at first. I bet not everyone liked the Beatles or Elvis when they get their start either, hmm?";KEEP THE HATERS COMING
37;74.0;1.0;7.0;"First of all, what kind of man would come out after two years to ""media hype"" and exploit himself as nothing more than someone who would achieve no end to get what he wants??  I remember seeing him on AI riding a bucking bronco partying at all the LA night spots instead of being committed to rehearsing and putting on a good performance the way Ruben Studdard, Clay Aiken, Kimberly Locke and Carmen Rasmussen did.  Second of all, why did he wait two years to come out with ""rubbish allegations"" against prima donna ""Paula Abdul"".  All that aside now, this CD is a prime example of the moral decline in America.  Supporters of Corey Clark obviously enjoy ""exploitation"" and suggestive ""lyrics"" and uninspired melodies brought about by someone who has compromised himself and his integrity as the means to gain his ends.  None of the songs on this CD merit a second listen.  Once was enough for me.  And don't worry, I didn't buy it.  I saw it at a used record emporium where more of his CDs will soon be.  This CD is a pure stinkeroo and Corey Clark is an excellent example of what is wrong with young people in america today.  No morals.";THIS CD IS A NIGHTMARE!
38;75.0;5.0;7.0;Corey is not getting a fair shake I think his music is so so so awesome I love the so many questions I related to that song Corey, I have been thru that too. I also love the duet with Sara Stokes from DA BAND that was hot you have a truly unique voice and I haven't heard any one like it since Michael Jackson you are the closet over Usher and Justin I love the CD and can wait to hear more best of luck to yah!!;I Love Coreys Songs
40;76.0;1.0;7.0;Corey Clark is only an object of titillation for the masses who like people like him....(judging that the CD has bombed and that no radio stations are playing the single and that he has been dropped from the label).  I am a disc jockey who will not play his music, not because of anything personal, but because if its not on the playlists, NO RADIO station is going to play the music!  As I say, only the teeny boppers find this guy attractive...and the music....well, quite simply....its horrible.  Get over the fact that your wonder boy has fizzled out and his fifteen minutes of fame are over.  It has nothing to do with hate...it has to do with talent (or the lack thereof)!;HOW CAN WE LOVE THE MUSIC WHEN ITS HORRIBLE??
56;77.0;1.0;7.0;This CD is not worth your time or money. The lyrics to the songs are lame and corey sounds like a teenage boy before puberty hits. Most of the titles to the songs are a joke also. Many of the tracks tend to be overproduced and make Corey sound like a girl. CD is not worth your time or money. Corey is just another person trying to ride on the coat tails of someone elses sucess by making false accusations!;Not worth it
66;78.0;1.0;7.0;Corey Clark can NOT SING,..well...he can run his mouth good but that is not music. This has to be one of the worst cd's I have heard in a long time.;Not worth a PENNY
67;79.0;1.0;7.0;"Mr. Clark's voice is whiny, pitchy going sharp and flat on most of the songs.  Who gave this guy a record deal???  What were they thinking??  No way did I buy this.  I just listened to it out of curiosity at the Blockbuster store which allows you to listen to the CDs before you purchase them to see if you like them.  The production is terrible and the vocals.....well....I've heard hyenas who sound better than Clark does.  I think he's just trying to cash in using any exploitative means possible and yes I am talking about the Paula Abdul scandal.  The song ""Paulatics"" is in very poor taste which also goes for the rest of the CD.  I feel very, very, sorry for people who are being taken in by this no talent scam artist.";I THOROUGHLY AGREE.....TRULY A DISASTER

My co-worker and I both just sat and stared at the computer wondering how anyone could give it 3,4,or 5 stars unless you are a Michael Jackson fan and have been waiting for his new album. Corey's pitch is too high and annoying. Thankfully I did not purchase this album, I only wish that I had not listened to begin with.;why oh why did I listen
70;81.0;1.0;7.0;I thought this cd was lifeless and boring. His voice was flat through most of the songs on this CD. The worst CD I've heard in a while. Paula forever!;Awful
9;82.0;2.0;6.0;Okay.  Nevermind the ongoing debate over whether you like Corey Clark as a person or not.  I am a fan of the show and therefore buy all the CD's that the contestants release.  I like some of them, I dislike some of them and so it goes.\n\nI bought this album with an open mind.  I actually wanted to like it.  I have to agree with the people that say that the songs sound largely the same.  He has a great voice, however, the music is not that great.  The majority of the tracks have the same beat with different words.  I was very disappointed.\n\nThat said .. I will buy any follow up CD that Corey puts out and hope I like it better.  Whomever produces the CD should taylor songs to Corey's strengths and vocal style.  They just fell short this time.;So So Album
12;83.0;1.0;6.0;"So where are all these radio stations that are supposedly playing this piece of junk?  They ought to get one of Paula Abdul's old CDs and play them both back to back and let both of them wade in the mire they've produced.  The truth is Corey Clark is an opportunist as another reviewer said and he and Paula Abdul deserve each other.  You'll like this CD if you like ""Munchkin sounds"".  Still, you'd be better off buying the ""Wizard of Oz"" soundtrack!!  Or ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" greatest hits!  But Clark does do a great imitation of them both!  He's very talented!!";IF MUSIC IS THE KEY THIS CD IS TERRIBLY OFF KEY!!
19;84.0;5.0;6.0;Whatever happened between him and Paula is irrelevant- I saw the special and was amazed at how much I liked the music he was recording and I promised myself I would buy his Cd when it came out- and I did. WOW! I LOVE this CD-I would even rate it one of the best R & B CDs in years! Corey has a gorgeous voice and reminds me of EL Debarge. The song So Many Questions is my favorite but the whole cd is REALLY good! Good work Corey! I love your work!;Forget the AI drama- this CD is AWESOME R & B from this era's new El Debarge!
21;85.0;5.0;6.0;I just want to address all of you haters out there. It's Too Little Too Late! Corey's CD is being played on the radio as we speak. The one that seems to be most popular is Follow That Back with Kid. The video is being played on MTV now as well as other stations for Out Of Control and the young people LOVE IT! So for all of you who have tried your best to crush him. You have failed miserably. It only helped to propel him forward and peak peoples interest. So I for one want to thank you for your help. As Corey has always said. It's about the music man and nothing else! If you like it you'll buy it. If you don't you won't. It's that simple. I could try and convince you how good it is. That is not necessary. You will only try to find fake flaws in it. The music speaks for itself. When you have people such as Scott Storch, Mike Landau, Sarah Stokes, Black Eyed Pea, John Hiedelberg, Ron Hiedelberg backing the cd. Well the names speak for themselves if you know anything about music. The majority of the people like Corey's music and they are buying it. The radio stations are playing it. It no longer matters how many people that they pay to put down his cd. It has caught on and there is no stopping it now. The momentum is growing positively.;It's a Hit and Then Some!
23;86.0;2.0;6.0;I am disappointed in Corey Clark's new CD.  Corey Clark is a very talented artist.  This CD does not do his voice justice.  When he performed on the American Idol Show I thought his voice was amazing.  His choice of songs on the show were great.  His voice does not come through very well on this CD.  I hope that he will continue to make music and sing songs that will show off his voice. The CD itself was done very nice.;Corey Clark - American Idol Contestant
8;87.0;1.0;5.0;This is a complete fiasco.  Its not even music, just noise.  I've heard better sounds coming from my garbage disposal.  No wonder it flopped!;A COMPLETE FIASCO
33;88.0;5.0;6.0;I ABSOLUTELY love this CD. If you love great dancing and Urban pop music, or if you appreciated the melodic treats of El Debarge and young Michael Jackson in the 80's -- this FUNKY COMPILATION is for YOU.  I bought it because my favorite music composer/producer TOM KEANE (Keane Brothers, Celine Dion, Chaka Khan, Black Eyed Peas) had his hand on most of the songs.  The layers, the hooks, the terrific effects, plus Michael Landau on guitar!  Corey Clark's voice is pristine and the compositions and arrangements are Grammy Worthy!  You won't regret purchasing this CD.  I GUARANTEE IT -- At this special price, order several copies and get free shipping!!!  Your teens will love the Urban Pop appeal, your 20 somethings too, and your 30 and 40+ friends or family members will love the REMINISCENT tones of the 80s.  There's a little treat for EVERYONE!  This CD will make you WIGGLE N' SHAKE Out of Control!!!;Finally FRESH MUSIC for the 21st Century....
45;89.0;5.0;6.0;I loved every bit of the CD!  His voice reminds me of DeBarge back in the day.... and It's so refreshing to hear someone that hits every note so well!!! His voice alone makes the CD very unique, I wish the best for this professional talent and I hope to hear more from Corey's God-Given talent! If people wouldn't get so caught up with the media and listened to the CD first hand opinions would change....This is a CD review NOT a news media review.  Keep your head up Corey!!;Excellent CD!!!!
69;90.0;1.0;6.0;I can't believe this guy!  I listened to this travesty at the Music Store where I work.  It is truly horrible.  He sounds like a cross between Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton.  It makes you wonder how these kids are getting these record deals.  God only knows.  What I can tell you is this:  At the music store where I work, we haven't sold one single product of his.  Another thing, he looks like a pimp on the cover of the CD.  I truly believe this guy will step on anyone or do anything to get what he wants.  If you want class and good music, skip this one......why ANYONE would want to support this guy and his lame music is beyond my grasp and comprehension.;ANOTHER HORRIBLE IDOL OFFERING
95;91.0;1.0;6.0;I had to force myself to listen to this dreadful piece of nonsense. It is one of the worst CD's i have heard all year, almost every track feels like a copy of something that Justin Timberlake and his like would come up with, but anyone else attempting it would achieve better results. That 'Paulatics' song is particularly ghastly, and the lyrics to it are appalling. It is quite clear that this man has no talent seeing as he has had to resort to slander in order to generate publicity for himself. I would highly recommend that you do not purchase this CD, your money would be better spent elsewhere.;Monotonous...
11;92.0;5.0;5.0;I have read the reviews. I have to agree with jecenterprises. It is quite humorous that the review you see first before jecenterprises is in response to jecenterprises. That really just added validity to it. Also if you look into Ricks reviews, all 2 of them they were both rated 1's. I too found Bed of Roses to be quite delightful. While Other people are busy trying to find flaws they are missing out on a great cd. I particularly liked the remake of All this Love. Thanks Rick, I bought it. I have also requested it at my local radio station. Guess what. They are going to play it. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys great music. Except Rick of course. He doesn't like anything!;Saw it , Read it,Heard it ,Bought it
18;93.0;2.0;5.0;"I had high expectations for this CD which only proves that one should not hold high expectations in the music world today because of the let down that follows.  With songs by the titles of ""Feenin"" (whatever the heck that is....) its no wonder this CD is being sold at used marketplaces for $1.00.  I agree, the bottom line is the music.  And in this case, it is overall bland with no distinctive quality either vocally or production-wise.  If you want to buy it the only place I've seen it available is here on Amazon and the used sellers for $1.59. Not bad for a CD that was just released.";For the price of $1.59??  Not bad for a CD that was just released!!
24;94.0;4.0;5.0;"I bought this CD because I like Corey Clark's voice when I heard it  during the second season of American Idol.  I like to hear male R&B singers like Kevon Edmonds and D'angelo sing falsetto.  That being said, I went online to hear samples of his self titled album on this site.  I liked at least three songs from the samples and discovered that it is a very solid album.  I could care less about the controversy between him and Paula Abdoul, but unfortunately a lot of people seem to care.  I blame Corey Clark for exposing the drama at the release of this album.  Maybe he was trying to sell more CDs.  If you are iterested in music and what it actually sounds like, it is a good album.  I thought it had a variety.  There are mature-sounding songs like ""Chance to Dance,"" ""Cherry on Top"" and ""So Many Questions.""  I prefer those songs.  He also has a nice danceable track called ""feenin"" and a few solid ballads like ""All This Love"" and ""That's My Girl.""  The song ""All This Love,"" originally done by El Debarge, is actually very good.  They updated the sound, maintained the quality of the vocals and added some original vocal arrangement.  I usually do not like songs that have been done again, but I was impressed with this version of the song.  These days when half the tracks on an album are good, I would rate it a solid album.  I believe Corey Clark shines on more than half the tracks.  The song ""That's My Girl"" features Sarah Stokes of ""Da Band,"" the group made from P. Diddy's show on MTV.  She sounds okay on that song, but it would still be a good song without her.  Also, super-producer Scott Storch, who produced Fat Joe's song ""Lean Back,"" produced a song on the album.  Surprisingly, Corey Clark receives quite a bit of writing credit compared to most new artists.  He honestly has some talent that we all can enjoy.  He has the look, the voice and some skills writing songs.  I would like to hear more from him in the future.  If you like popular R&B music, you should like this material.";Do not underestimate Corey Clark, you will miss out on good music.
30;95.0;5.0;5.0;I always believed Corey had what it takes to make it! Now I know he does. The CD is not cookie-cutter like so much of what we hear today - which is refreshing after listening to the same 'ole, same 'ole...the Corey Clark CD is:\n\n  ENTERTAINING & UNIQUE!\n\n  SEXY & FUN!\n\n  A MUST BUY!!;MUST BUY!!
31;96.0;5.0;5.0;Who ever decided to help Corey put this cd together is a genius! SOOOOOO refreshing to hear real vocals for a change. I for one listen to this cd day and night. There are so many songs that are hit quality. I would like to hear more of him on the radio. Follow that back is funky. Out of Control is HOT. Chance to Dance is just a hit in the makin. Cherry on Top is so sexy. All this Love is defintely out of this world. So Debarge yet so Corey. Truthfully has such a latino feel and yet so unique. Bed of Roses is layed back and just so soothing. I recommend this to everyone who likes great vocals.;Some Like it Hot!
36;97.0;5.0;5.0;for all corey supporters listen up! when fighting this battle against these obivous devout supporters of the ai corporation and paula abdul refer to the source! coreys book is in his own words he tells the complete story there, and if you are dealing with a person who can't or won't read then you are dealing with a person whom in a battle of wits has come unarmed! Facts are facts, hype is hype, these people hype about the facts this kid speaks. [...] these are people who are informed and are making valid points, there's no way on god's green earth you can deny the awesome talent our creator has infused in this kid, he's backed by great production and obviously a sorry excuse for a record label, where's the promotion where's the commercials for this kid, or the radio and marketing team! something fishy is going on there and it's not corey clarks music, i myself give it five stars.  It's great to hear song again in a time filled with gangster rap hate and violence.  there's so much love on this cd, happiness, feel good music, music for all ages.  the ballads are his best! i'm sorry, when it comes to singing none of these other so called superstars out there in his genre can hold a torch to this kid, wait until the right label with the right work ethic gets behind this real superstar! listen to the record there is no denying mr corey clark!  He's fine, he's got his own smooth style, he writes his own music, HE'S NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY OF THE CRIMES THE NEWS KEEPS REPORTING ABOUT!  He's a real role model for people who run into obstacles in life and keep churning, he's exactly what young america needs to be, Truthful and real!  if you notice paula abdul nor american idol have ever DIRECTLY DENIED COREY'S CLAIMS! You can't dismiss something that's true, but you can make fun of it, and spoof it.  Buy the album and the book and judge for yourself, not off what someone else says, i bought two for home and my car and sent out others as birthday gifts because its actually good music.  if sara stokes, Taboo and Apl D of the black eyed peas, and Kid from Kid and Play think it's good enough to be on with him and these are all gold selling artists and up, isn't it worth a listen. the answer is YES! You are REFRESHING COREY CLARK, THANKYOU!;COREY CLARKS MUSIC IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!
42;98.0;1.0;5.0;A poor CD.  Despite the controversy (although it was hard to ignore for awhile), Corey Clark still managed to put out an awful CD with lame songs.  My ears started to hurt halfway through.  Attempt failed.;Oh, my ears!
43;99.0;1.0;5.0;"This CD is very lame.  If its so good, why was he dropped from his record label?  Why has the CD sunk lower than Justin Guarini's?  I thought Guarini was bad but this guy is in for some big disappointments. And not because of the ""Paula"" thing.  Who cares about that nonsense???  The matter of fact is the music.  Is it good or not?  These lyrics are banal and trite and the melodies and production values are downright overproduced and mawkish.  Add to this an unimpressive voice with a CD cover that reminds one of....oh, never mind....forget Corey Clark.";ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS IN MUSIC HISTORY!
55;100.0;1.0;5.0;"Folks, this young man is another example of ""exploitation"" in the music business.  This CD is a prime example of this.  Please do not buy into this kind of titillation in the music business;  I for one will not endorse Corey Clark in any of his undertakings.  He is a bad example for young people today and the lyrics on this CD more than confirm that fact.  Who ever thought to give him a record deal anyhow?  If you want wholesome, decent, music, look elsewhere.  You will not find it on this CD.  Don't buy into this propoganda of exploitation and evil!";I AGREE WITH THE ONE STAR REVIEWS

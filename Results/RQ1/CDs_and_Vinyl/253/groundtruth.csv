244;1.0;2.0;292.0;"For a singer that has made a career of citing his desire to push musical boundaries and stating that he dislikes ""heavy metal,"" Geoff Tate has done himself and the entire Queensryche fan base a huge disservice with Frequency Unknown.\n\nSlapped together in just a couple months time, ""F.U."" is a throwaway album with little substance. Written primarily by Tate and producer Jason Slater, the album features a variety of generic metal guitar riffs, uninspiring vocal melodies, predictable and at times juvenile lyrics and downright poor performances by some of the musicians on the record.\n\nThe first single, ""Cold,"" is probably the best cut of the bunch, but marred by a guitar solo that really sticks out as something meant for a different song. Other tunes such as ""Running Backwards,"" ""In the Hands of God,"" and ""Everything"" show promise, but are ruined by lackluster vocal performances by Tate and spotty production.\n\nReleased under the name of ""Queensryche,"" Frequency Unknown is a bit misleading. None of the founding members of the band appear on it. Instead, it's just Tate (the band's original singer that was fired by his former bandmates in 2012) and a bunch of hired guns.\n\nThe result is clunky at best. Instead of capturing a particular vibe or sound, Frequency Unknown sounds like a compilation album of whatever songs Slater and some others had lying around for Tate to sing over. It's just not a very good organic listening experience.\n\nFrequency Unknown also features a number of Queensryche's classic hits re-recorded by Tate and a number of backup singers and various musicians. The re-recordings sound flat and contrived, and Tate admitted in various interviews when promoting the record that he did it primarily for the money -- yes, you read that right. Tate had no artistic reasons for doing the re-recordings. He did it for the cash.\n\nIt shows. The re-records are an abomination and an insult to the original songwriters and performers and the fans.\n\nDo yourselves a huge favor. Sample this record. Listen to it fully, legally, before buying. I'm not going to rate this as a ""1,"" because frankly, there are some quality bits and pieces of music on here. It's not all out trash (the re-records are, however). But it's absolutely not Queensryche and the songs are marred by a huge lack of quality control.\n\nBuyer beware.";Has there ever been a more contrived record?
197;2.0;1.0;191.0;"This record sounds exactly like what it is:\n\n- 6 week rush job to ""be first"" and release a record before the other guys.\n\n- an album almost entirely pre-written by one of the most bland rock producers/musicians out there (and Tate's personal plastic sex doll).........Jason Slater. He admitted as much on his website taking jabs at those who took issue with Tate ""using good songs that were available"" to him. Don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself. There you can also see him admit that the album had a six week window from beginning to end. You get what you pay for in life.\n\n- Horribly contrived and forced. Tate has been going on and on about how much he hates metal and how much he will never conform to the fans who want him to play metal. He's gone on and on over the past year about how he will never allow himself to ""become a nostalgia act"". Funny then, that he farts out this obvious attempt at trying to be heavy (by bringing in guest musicians specializing in that kind of music). He's got the band's biggest hits re-recorded (we'll get to that). And on his current tour he's playing Mindcrime in it's entirety for like the 37th time. And oh yeah, playing an encore full of songs not off this album, but hits from 2 decades ago. So much for that never conforming to nostalgia thing.\n\n- Sound quality. 6 weeks front to back. Again, you get what you pay for. Jason Slater boasted on his website about getting the record done in 6 weeks. He went on and on about how great it sounded and how awesome a job Maor Applebaum (or what ever the eff his name is) did mastering it. DOH!! But wait! Record company said NOPE. Huge fan backlash. So they brought in another guy with supposedly impeccable credentials to mix it since Slater and this Appleseed character effed it up so bad in the first place. And then the replacement guy quit! He knew better than to try and climb the s***-rope. And who knows who finally finished what still sounds like a Garage Band software beginner trying his his hand at mixing for the first time.\n\n- The re-records. Oh, the lamentable re-records. I challenge each of you to prep the originals and play them side by side with these travesties. I promise you'll either laugh or cry.....or possibly drop dead of a heart attack at how bad it sounds on every level. All of the instrumentation on these re-records performed by some guy I never heard of. And he sucks. Some of it sounds flat out digitally created. Tate can't even come close to the source material anymore and it really shows. But hey, just watch the guy try and sing on the current tour and you'll understand why. Wine and smokes ain't so hot for the formerly golden pipes there, Tater.\n\nIn summary: if I were to rent a boat and drive it to the Farallon Islands, hang a couple of bloody fish heads from my testicles and drench myself in chum, and then jump into water notorious for large numbers of hungry Great White sharks it would still be a more enjoyable experience than listening to this album and what it represents.";Sad and hilarious at the same time
248;3.0;1.0;164.0;"I admit I was predisposed to dislike the album before I even listened.  That may seem unfair, but my predisposition was based on the fact that, with the exception of a few standout tracks, the past four Queensryche albums have been abyssmal.  As far as this album is concerned, Overall, I am a bit surprised.  Frequency Unknown is not as bad as I thought it would be, and there are more moments that I like than I would have thought.  But the ideas are not fleshed out well at times, the vocal melodies are frequently half-baked, and the vocal delivery is just outright painful and bad most of the time.  But most of all, this sounds like a Geoff Tate solo effort and not like something that should have the Queensryche name attached.  The three biggest problems I have with the album can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  Everything sounds rushed and underdeveloped.  There are some good ideas and some good melodies.  But nothing about the album feels like any amount of care or thought was put into making it sound and feel like a finished product.  Most of us know the facts behind how this album was put out.  We know that it was a rush job.  The problem is, it SOUNDS like a rush job, whether we are talking about the poor mix, the disjointed ""cut-and-paste"" sound of of the songs, or what have you.\n\n2.  The singing is atrocious.  Geoff Tate was a key influence of mine, both in terms of getting into singing in the first place, and also in terms of pushing the envelope in my singing.  However, his singing has so badly deteriorated that it is painful to listen to.  Tate sounds strained, nasal, and off-key more often than not, and is far and away the weakest link on this album.  This is not a matter of personal taste.  He is objectively singing incorrectly and in a way that detracts from any positives these songs might have.  And that is a shame bacause, as mentioned above, some of these songs truly show promise and could have been decent.\n\n3.  The album does not have the ""Queensryche sound.""  I do not mean to try to ""put the band in a box.""  One of the things I have always appreciated about Queensryche is that they have always changed and grown their sound.  Even in their earliest history, each album sounded very different from anything else in the catalog.  And yet, there was always a trademark complexity and depth to their sound.  I felt that Slater finally managed to capture that a bit on American Soldier.  However, with a few exceptions, it has largely been missing for several albums, and this latest Geoff Tate solo effort mislabeled as ""Queensryche,"" that trend continues.\n\nIf Tate and his team had taken the time to refine some of the ideas on this album, and if he had taken the time to work hard and sing correctly, this could have been a good album.  It still would not be a Queensryche album, but it could have been something worthwhile.  As it is, I have given it a fair listen, and see no reason I will ever be compelled to listen again.";Some songs have promise, but this badly misses the mark
5;4.0;1.0;6.0;For those not aware, this album is not technically Queensryche. This is Geoff Tate's childish and futile effort to cut the remaining original members out and keep the Queensryche name. This is not artistry, this is a sham. So glad the other band members won their case and got to keep the name and most of the music rights. It's really so sad to watch a much loved music icon have a midlife insanity and ruin so many things in so many lives.;shameful sham
2;5.0;1.0;89.0;"This is a collection of songs born out of nothing more than hate, spite and the desire to lash out at and ""one-up"" Geoff's former band mates.  My expectations were low given the rushed nature of the project (written, recorded and ""mixed"" in six weeks to beat the other Queensrche to a release) but this release re-defines the term ""scraping the barrel"".\n\nTo be fair there are a few good ideas on some of the original tracks but inevitably they're virtually all ruined by a deathly flat production, Geoff's uninspired, phoned-in vocals, and a real feeling of middle-of-the-road ennui that pervades the entire project. It doesn't help that the guitar solo contributions from the myriad of ""special guest stars"" (some of whom should know better) have been seemingly just dropped into random songs with no real attempt to blend them in or marry each solo to an appropriate song.  Virtually nothing on here would be recognizable as a Queensrche song if you took Geoff's vocals out.\n\nAnd as for the four re-recorded classics... Well, I'm almost speechless. Each one is a wretched abomination, a pale shadow of its original with weak uninspired playing, awful cheesy arrangements and Geoff horrifyingly out of tune a good proportion of the time. Just really sad.\n\nWeak, lifeless, insipid.\n\nIf you can find something to like in this then good for you, but to my ears this falls far, far short of being worthy of the Queensrche legacy.";Tame and limp. Sounds NOTHING like Queensrche.
181;6.0;1.0;79.0;"This is a completely honest review from a long time Queensryche fan... To anyone wanting to actually purchase this album: don't be fooled by the over the top praise in some reviews. This is a shameless trick to do nothing short of defraud you out of your $10. Go read them, and you'll realize that most of them are on the payroll for Geoff Tate/Cleopatra Records. That alone should tell you what to expect from this abomination. It is SO bad, they have to have fake reviews published on Amazon to keep the rating at 2 stars instead of the 1 it honestly deserves. And the reality is that the mix is terrible; the proof is that the record company asks that you keep the receipt, scan it, and email it to them to receive a more ""proper"" mix... If the mix was bad, why release it? Why take money from your fans/customers knowing full well that your product is inferior? I'm not even getting into the details of how Geoff Tate assaulted his band mates of 25 years, or that there is a court case pending regarding the name... The simple fact is, this record is a rushed, poorly written, horribly sung and subpar listen from a man that used to stand for everything that was right in music. This is absurdly shameful, and Geoff Tate, his record company, and all the people involved with publishing fake 5-star reviews to try and cash in on hard-working fans who don't know any better should take a look in the mirror and feel awful about themselves. Tate showed his true colors when he told a Rocklahoma crowd that the ""sucked""... Here, he and his team are treating them accordingly. And as for the actual record: it sounds nothing like Queensrche; right down to the vocals. The music is boring, the singing is strained, and the songwriting is terrible. This is a Geoff Tate solo record and should be marketed as such. It has absolutely nothing in common with the QR that we all know and love.";F.U.
235;7.0;2.0;75.0;"Look, I get it- no matter how bad an album is there will always be a few people who like it. Objectively this album is probably closer to a 2 or 3 at the most (on a day when the stars are aligned and I'm feeling particularly generous), but I simply can't understand the 5 star reviews. As a Tate solo project I'd give it 3 (but only if you remove tracks 2,3, and 4 which are utterly banal as well as the re-recordings at the end which are straight up terrible and insulting to the original band). As Queensryche, I refuse to rate it because it is NOT Queensryche. As a Tate solo album posing egregiously as Queensryche? 2 stars. The production is sub-par, Tate's vocals are barely adequate, and the ""band"" (if you're brave enough to call them that) is a collection of hired guns which contains none of the original members and sounds disturbingly like a melange of 80's and 90's bands. Pay particular attention to the guitar tone. Hey, I like Motley Crue! I like Nirvana! They were awesome in the 80's and early 90's. Do I want to hear an album played by a hair metal cover band and sung by a Geoff Tate who has lost at least 50% of his vocal range and apparently his ability to discern pitch? NO. I really don't. And I especially don't want to read another 5 star shill review. Even if you LIKE this album, you cannot objectively claim that it's a 5 star product! If you do, you are FULL OF IT. PERIOD!\n\nWill update with detailed thoughts after I've spun it a few more times.\n\n***\nUpdate: I've listened to the whole thing a few times today while at work and feel that it's still massively disappointing. It has a few good musical ideas amidst the scattershot songwriting and some brief moments where I can ALMOST hear a spark of Queensryche in there. ""In the Hands of God"" and ""The Weight of the World"" are the only legitimately Queensryche-ish tracks from beginning to end- being very reminiscent of material from ""Promised Land""- while ""Cold"", ""Running Backwards"", ""Life Without You"" and ""Fallen"" all have moments yet leave me frustrated thinking how much better they could have been if not rushed. However, whatever spark you hear is purely manufactured. It's not organic. It isn't in any substantive way what it tries very poorly to be and is at best a ""facile forgery"" to quote Roger Waters re: Pink Floyd after his departure. At best, this album is merely better than ""Dedicated to Chaos"", which isn't saying much.\n\nIn most ways I stand by my original assessment of Tate's vocals and the band's overall sound. Listen to this album then go listen to ""The Warning"" or ""Operation: Mindcrime"". The things Geoff used to be able to do with his voice- amazing! The legendary songs the band used to write before Tate started pre-empting their input- timeless! Don't get me wrong- I'm not really criticising the man for losing his vocal range. He's getting older- that's to be expected. However, what he DOES need to do is take the time to re-learn his voice and carefully craft the vocal melodies to play to his strengths rather than just winging it and failing miserably. It sounds sloppy and just comes across lazy and uninterested. Nuff said on that. Additionally, I'm particularly flummoxed by the guitar solos. I feel much the same way about Neal Schon on the last several Journey albums. Listen to a solo that contains the loosest melodic tie to the song suddenly explode with notes. Yeah, dude, I get it... you can play 3 notes rapidly (notes that are completely unnecessary to the song no less). That's SO rock n' roll *allow me a rock n' eyeroll, here*. Listen to ""Silent Lucidity"" for an example of a perfect solo. I LOVE guitar solos, but they have to be musically relevant to the song and not just generic explosions of notes shoehorned in there. This leads me to another point.\n\nApproximately when did the band become generic rock? I'd argue that it was with ""Hear in the Now Frontier"", an album I hated. Then again, I also kind of liked ""Q2k"" (though I understand the complaints of the naysayers). Still, let's go through most of the catalog. ""Tribe""? Generic but decent. ""Take Cover""? Bad. ""Operation: Mindcrime 2""? Barely average beyond the only bright spot which was the great Ronnie James Dio's contribution (R.I.P. Dio- you finally hung up your cape and scepter). ""American Soldier""? Nice try but not quite. ""Dedicated to Chaos""? Barf. Hey, Geoff- you know singing and talking aren't the same thing, right? In my honest opinion the last truly great Queensryche album was ""Promised Land"". Wow, what a risky album coming on the heels of ""Empire""! It's in parts heavy and in others sounds like Pink Floyd. Love it, as I love every release before it.\n\nI don't expect Queensryche to be the same band that made the first 6 albums (from the EP to ""Promised Land""). However, I don't think Tate has the moral right to call this QR simply because he was the original singer. He has NONE of the original musicians on board the sinking ship here. Maybe if he had creatively contributed a LOT over the years (which he didn't- writing the lyrics but none of the music doesn't count in my book). Maybe if his voice was still up to par (which is isn't). Maybe if 3 of the original members weren't also running a band called Queensryche- members that were there before even he was. Members that HIRED HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE!\n\nThis brings me to the remakes. The ONLY reason for Tate to actually remake these songs is in an attempt to demonstrate that he can still sing the band's most popular tunes- probably to gain some leverage in legal proceedings. Well played, Geoff. While he can technically still barely sing those songs in a studio setting, he won't even attempt anything pre-Mindcrime, nor will he do as well live (which he's shown numerous times). The re-recordings sound like what you'd expect to hear from a cover band that booked studio time and made a half-assed go at it. They pretty much spit in the face of the originals, which are clearly superior in every meaningful way.\n\nOpen letter to Geoff Tate: Why, Geoff? Why can't you put away your pride? QR album sales have tanked as the brand has becomed increasingly damaged over the years by you and your wife/manager. Open your eyes, man! Look at the numbers if nothing else. Look- I don't hate you. I think you were amazing in your day- one of the greatest of all time, in fact. You deserve kudos and serious recognition for your contribution to straight up awesome progressive rock music yet I think you have to acknowledge that those days are gone for you. I think you're clinging desperately to the QR name while simultaneously muddying it. This really is the sinking of the Tate-tanic, buddy. Time to get off the ship and let it go. The rest of the band is already on a lifeboat and sailing away...from YOU. -A Concerned Fan\n\nIn June this will likely all become a moot point. Unless I'm just sadly mistaken, the La Torre headed REAL Queensryche (sailing towards their fans on that lifeboat- see what I did there?) will vastly outsell FU by returning to their roots and making music more reminiscent of the golden age progressive material that the majority of us want. No- I don't want them to make ""The Warning"" ad nauseam, but I'd like something that at least has a soul inspired by the best the band has done, rather than the worst. Don't you agree?";"I shall dub this ship the ""Tate-tanic"""
0;8.0;1.0;73.0;"Short version: This CD is an insult to the Queensryche fans and name! Deadline Music/Cleopatra had released the following statement to BLABBERMOUTH regarding reports that ""Frequency Unknown"" was being remixed by acclaimed musician, record producer and engineer Billy Sherwood though he announced less than a week later that his schedule was too full ""proper excuse 101"" ie: Tate and the mix are a nightmare!\n\nDeadline, the label releasing this said weeks ago the following: ""Since previews of the new QUEENSRYCHE album were made available to the general public on iTunes and other digital retailers, some of the response has been less than positive. Some complained about the overall quality of the recordings, and in particular the mix. We here at Deadline Music have the utmost confidence in the powerful songwriting and outstanding performances from Geoff Tate and crew on this album, but we also want the fans to know that we are listening to them as well! So, in the interest of democratic free choice, Deadline Music has commissioned to remix the album. Now fans will be able to decide which mix they feel best represents the album: the original mix, which will be released on April 23rd, or the new mix that will be made available at a future date to be announced.... WE REMIX, YOU DECIDE!"" SO DEADLINE AND TATE EXPECT YOU TO BUY THIS GARBAGE TWICE!!!\n\nMix issues, being that most the songs suffer from the mid-range in the mix between Tate's vocals, the guitars and the snare so close together they get muddied up lessening the separation. I'm sure this was one of a dozen things Billy Sherwood was to be hired to repair though less than a week later he begged out using the ""previous commitments 101"" excuse. The reverb on Tate's vocals is far too much, either to help smooth over what autotune couldn't hide or because the re-recordings were mixed by a less experienced producer...though the rest is not exactly top notch production so that isn't saying much. The song COLD is the only track mixed half way decently so I'm lost as to why the other tracks are so inferior.\n\nAs for the music the musicianship isn't on par with Michael Wilton, Parker Lundgren, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield. Tate's vocals sound very flat/uninspired and without emotion when compared to the aggressive direction of the music attempts to pull off while the hired musicians destroy the re-recordings of the classics re-recorded.....yet another FU to fans and testament to Tate's massive ego as seen by all who attended Rocklahoma 2012.\n\nI anxiously await the REAL Queensryche now fronted with La Torre to be releasing their CD in June as this one with Tate is just terrible. Not worth downloading for free from the usual sites!";Deadline Music & Tate CROOKS! Releasing substandard mix while doing new mix to be released later so people buy BOTH?

It would be one thing if Tate hired his ""all-star"" band to write an actual piece of classic heavy metal, or even heavy prog, but he just needed some credible names to attach to it to differentiate it from his solo crap.  The ironic thing is that he accuses his former bandmates of tarnishing the Queensrche brand for reviving their classic style, then he pieces together a quick collection of solo grunge/nu-metal/radio rock and recruits about a dozen hired guns to help record it, as if this somehow adds something of value to the brand he's so worried about.  Add in the horrendous quality of the four re-recorded songs, and you have a legitimate trainwreck on your hands.

Is. NOT. Queensryche.
1;11.0;1.0;58.0;"One of my all time favorite bands, and with this split, I wanted to support both acts...but the more I see how Geoff has acted and the actions he has taken...and just hearing this half-a$$ed rush job, just to beat his former band mates before their release, and probably realizing come November, he won't be able to use the name Queenryche anymore...he has acted like a child in all this, and any respect I have had for him is gone.  This album is way over engineered and rushed...his re-recordings of older songs are horrible, and for that matter are mixed with parts of the original recording of the songs, to try and make it sound better.  This is not Queensryche!  Proof, that one man does not make a band!\n\nUpdate...so, just to fight the good fight....I must add...On the Tate run facebook Queensryche page,  I had been monitoring both pages (the Tate ""hijacked"" one, and the ""real"" QR page with LaTorre)...I was curious on the thoughts of all people.....I started to notice that if anyone wrote a non favorable review on the Tate run site....the post was immediately removed!  Again, they were non vulgar etc...They just expressed their displeasure with what Tate was doing with the QR name.  So what really got to me, was the fact that then, these people were bashed as Trolls, Haters, and Bullies...and most were then banned, unable to defend themselves etc.....I got fed up, and called them out on it....a particular person named Angela (last name withheld), who I guess manages the page, was the main person, who did this...and I noticed posts from her, bashing anyone who did not kiss the feet of Tate and she would call them the above names etc....So when I called her out on this...of course what was the response!  A threat of banning, and called me a Bully and Troll etc....\n\nSo I just want the common fan to hear this, because it should be said.....its a classless act by a desperate group of people!  I look forward to November, when the true Queensryche (Eddie, Michael, Scott, Todd, and Parker) get full rights to the name, and Tate and the old QR page can be taken down, never to use the name again!....They have proven, they do not deserve to!!";I'll be waiting for June 11th, when the REAL Queensryche releases their album!
240;12.0;1.0;58.0;"Even with my built-in disdain for Mr. Tate, I tried to give this an objective listen. The problem is that there is no way around the fact that 1) the album is a mess, and 2) there is no band here.\n\nNumerous ""guest musicians"" and another Slater-dominated slate of songs just winds up sounding like bits and pieces that someone cobbled together to make a quick buck, with uneven production and songs that meander without any purpose. Some of the songs show some promise, musically, but they lack structure and take a downturn as soon as Tate begins to sing. Tate's lyrics continue the theme of his most recent works--Kings & Thieves and Dedicated to Chaos--and are juvenile, cliched, self-aggrandizing and mostly uninspired. And as someone who once was one of Tate's biggest fans, it pains me to say that his vocals continue to sound strained and sub-par, as if he can barely hold a note. The tone is there at times, but the technique is all but gone. The less said about the re-records, the better. Any long-time Queensryche fan should be offended at how bad they are. Geoff Tate himself should be offended at how bad they are, and should be ashamed for taking a paycheck for such dreck.\n\nRegarding the ""band"" itself, there... really isn't one. The members of Tate's alleged ""Queensryche"" do not play on one single song together on this album and, in fact, Randy Gane is the only ""member"" who even plays on half of these songs. The rest are hired session musicians playing the parts they've been told to play, likely by Jason Slater since everyone knows that Tate does not write music. Calling this ""Queensryche"" is a farce, when this is nothing more than a glorified Tate solo album, and there is very little Queensryche sound in any of it.\n\nJudging it as a Tate solo affair, I would have given it 2 stars. However, the mislabeling of this as Queensryche combined with the atrocious re-records compel me to give it only a single star.";A mess of an album from the Geoff Tate solo machine
245;13.0;1.0;57.0;I feel bad for anyone like me who actually bought this disc. I can't believe they re-recorded such classic songs and RUINED them. I really wanted to like this album...but the recording quality and song style on this disc make it impossible. I agree with others on this review board that this would have been FAR better as a solo album. the only positive I could say is if you forget to listen to the atrocity of the re-recorded songs at the end, this album is only slightly better than 'Dedicated to Chaos'. Geoff....time to hang it up man.;NOT IMPRESSED
4;14.0;1.0;54.0;Uninspired and bland this record sounds like it was recorded in a closet the songs are boring and sound horrible nothing more to say;This is a Mess
188;15.0;1.0;52.0;This is the most substandard piece of garbage I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. The whole thing was cobbled together by Geoff's long time producer Jason Slater. It's not even a band. The entire thing is a horrible demo at best. How any professional musician can release something of this abysmal sound quality to the public is beyond me. It is wretched beyond words! And what kind of narcissistic sociopath entitles his album F.U.?;ABOMINATION!!!!!
225;16.0;1.0;52.0;"I have heard this album in full when it was leaked on Soundcloud by the record label, and while there are moments that sound okay, my main issue with this album is that it is a collaboration of outside writers, uncredited session players and an assortment of guest musicians, all brought in by Geoff to create a 'heavy Queensryche album'. It fails. Geoff for the most part is using the same outside collaboration team that he has used on all albums under the Queensryche name since Operation Mindcrime 2. That album marked a shift away from involving the core members of Queensryche (Wilton, Rockenfield, Jackson) in anything creative. On most of those latter albums, the core members of QR ideas were dismissed, and they were instead given songs written by others, complete with vocals written over them, and told to learn parts to then record those parts. If you are a creative individual, then going from making your own music, to now being told to learn something someone else wrote, and then put your name on it is enough to make one not want to be part of the greater project. So those releases from OM2 on, if you listen to them, the music may sound different, the performances may sound off, and the reason is that you are listening to music written by someone else, performed many times by some uncredited session musician, not the band you are a fan of.\n\nSo why the 1 star for Frequency Unknown? Because this is more of the same. The truth is that Geoff was fired from Queensryche and replaced. They are on tour with their new singer, and have an album due for release June 11. That album is a band effort, written by the 5 members of the band (3 of them original founders of Queensryche), recorded where Mindcrime and Empire were recorded, recorded and produced by the same engineer behind Mindcrime and Empire. If you are a fan of Queensryche from their heyday, when this was how the band wrote and recorded, then that release with the new singer should be something you are interested.\n\nGeoff was fired, and as a result of the court not telling him to not create his own version of Queensryche, he did just that. The band you see is his touring band, but the recording he did is far more involved. Frequency Unknown has, and I counted, 24 people involved in writing or performing songs on this album. This includes the touring band, a group of guest performers who came and did as little as a guitar solo, or as much as the majority of guitar work and drums on the album. It also includes the producer putting his musician hat on and playing, and a bunch of his unknown session guys, which they are capable players, but no one has ever heard of them. This album was 'in response' to a lot of things, and it shows. It was 'in response' to the pending court date, so come November, Geoff can say he has an album out with the Queensryche name on it...he is trying to get the rights of the band name, so he needs to show why, hence this album, and the tour. It is also in response to the real Queensryche announcing their studio work.\n\nThe gory details are all online for people to hunt down and see. So onto the review...\n\nThis album was recorded with a self imposed 6 week time frame, to write, record, mix, master, and package. It is heard. There has been posts from the engineer/producer and the record company acknowledging the fact that the album sounds rushed and sonically not good. There has also been talk of it being remixed, but that the April 23rd release date would be kept, with a remix version following...so the record label acknowledges issues, yet still releases this. If for nothing else, if you are a fan of Geoff and this album, hold off until you get something that sonically is better.\n\nThe songs are all written by others. On past releases, this was all Jason Slater, so even though the overall sound was different, song to song it was consistent. Not the case on this record, because there appears to be four distinct groups that wrote and provided songs for this album. Each writing group has its own style, so the songs do not sound consistent from one to the other. Add to this the ensemble cast that is playing on these tracks, and you lose any band identity from song to song. This is the issue: QR was never just about the vocals, but Geoff has marginalized the band's involvement and importance. But my first listen to this album was that ""ok...it isn't as bad as I thought...but it sounds nothing like Queensryche"". Queensryche's sound to me was always about guitar harmonies, tight background vocal harmonies, precise drumming, and a clean sonic sound from the guitars. Listen to Empire...song to song to song, whether it was Wilton writing the song, or Chris, they all sound similar. Same with Mindcrime. Sonically, from album start to finish, things were consistent. You could tell when Chris was playing versus Mike, can tell it was Eddie playing bass by his bass tone, and could tell it was Rock playing by the finesse he brings to playing drums.  All of that made up the QR sound, and all of that is lacking on this new release from Geoff and company. There wasn't a single thing on any of the songs that invoked in me any sense that 'this is Queensryche'.\n\nThe re-records are terrible, and all you have to do is compare the energy of the originals with these pale comparisons. I am pretty certain I Don't Believe in Love is using a drum machine on drums, as listening to that track on headphones, I could hear very hard panning on the cymbals, and every cymbal hit was exactly the same as the one previous...which is how drum machines sound, not how a live drummer sounds or plays. JCW, the solo sounds pieced together, and four minutes in there is clearly something heard, whether it is a bad edit or just a bad run of notes that somehow didn't get caught. And towards the end of the solo, whoever is playing that solo (I suspect it is Kelly Gray) decides to finger tap, rather than play the runs, and it sounds amateur. It is also speculated that the original raw vocal track was used in some capacity on this recording, and comparing the re-record to the original, I can hear it as the same.  25 years later, there is no way that Geoff could pull that off. If he could, we would have heard it on live clips, and every live clip he back away from the high notes. Further, elsewhere on the re-records, Geoff holds his range back, so why then are these parts in this one re-record the only place where Geoff sounds like the Geoff of back when? The mass chorus backing vocals also do not work, and I can clearly hear Geoff's daughters singing. Geoff flat out admitted the re-records were for the record company's use, to use on compilation albums. It would be one thing if there was an attempt to make these as good as the originals, but then the question would be why? Maybe they were done quick because the money for the re-records was there, and Geoff knows that anyone with half a brain would choose the originals over these any day.\n\nAs a straight out rock record, aside from production concerns, this isn't a terrible record. If it said Geoff Tate on the front, and was put out as an all star solo effort, I would have rated this higher. But by trying to force the Queensryche name on this, it begs for comparisons, and it is so far removed from what was Queensryche that I can't give it anything but the lowest rating, because it is not worthy of standing along side the catalog of the band. At least with OM2 through Dedicated to Chaos, the original band was behind those releases even if their involvement was minimized. I have heard the original band live with Geoff play songs from those releases, and they do them justice, and live they sound more like QR than the albums sound. This release has no identity, no soul to the music. It is less about the creative process, and more about the assembly line mentality. Geoff has been interviewed about this release, and in those interviews, was unable to name all the players involved in this record. When asked if they would be playing anything live, his response was that 'they haven't learned it yet', making me wonder how much was on the shoulders of the guests, and whether the touring band, the face of Geoff's Queensryche, was as involved with this recording as originally thought.\n\nI would say anyone seeing this, do yourself a favor and listen to all the samples online, try and find on YouTube any full tracks, and really listen to what Geoff is putting out. Music is subjective, open to opinion, and people may like what they hear, but may have a hard time associating this with Queensryche and everything that band has done in the past. Listen to Mindcrime, Empire, Promised Land, HITNF, and even Q2K and Tribe, both albums that involved the core band, the latter marking a return of Chris D on the recording. Remember what brought you to Queensryche in the first place and compare that to this new recording. I did...and for me, because this album is so far removed from that musical identity of the band, I give it 1 star.";NOT Queensryche - Some clarification for the casual fans
203;17.0;1.0;51.0;"First of all, this is NOT Queensryche. Period. Geoff Tate was fired from QR after he spat on drummer Scott Rockenfield, and assaulted him and guitarrist Michael Wilton on stage. Yes, he did that at work place. Geoff Tate and his wife and manager, Susan Tate, also tried to steal money from QR - actually, if we bring the The Voodoos incident to the table, they did steal money from Queensryche.\n\nGeoff Tate's swansong in Queensryche was telling the Rocklahoma audience that they suck. Pretty classy, right? Well, he doesn't like when people left his show before it ends. He calls them pussies. That's the class he shows on the cover of this abomination called ""Frequency Unknown"". FU, really? He was dragging Queensryche through the mud before he was fired, but it wasn't enough. He can't accept he was fired, he doesn't want to move on, so until the court date (November 18th) he's going to do whatever he can to low the Queensryche brand. Why? He knows he can't and won't have the name.\n\nThat said, this album is pretty awful. One decent song, ""Cold"", and the rest is lame. Funny thing his voice is the weakest link on the record, but the producing, mixing and playing don't help either. Songs like ""Dare"" and ""Slave"" are really, really bad songs. Geoff Tate can't write a single song by his own, so he had Jason Slater again to help him to deliver a record. Yes, the same guy behind ""Operation: Mindcrime II"", a record that should not have been released, and ""Dedicated to Chaos"", one of the worst albums of all time (yes, because we're talking about Queensryche, for Christ's sake!).\n\nIt surprises me to see people giving five stars to this piece of garbage. Five stars? Really? Are you sure you are Queensryche fans? Have you ever listened to ""The Warning"", ""Rage for Order"", ""Operation: Mindcrime"" or ""Empire""? Or even ""Promised Land""? Think about that.\n\nAnd while Geoff Tate and his fake Queensryche band are on the road butchering the ""Operation: Mindcrime"" masterpiece (please, go check on YouTube, but beware: it's horrendous!), the real Queensryche is on fire, delivering what the fans wanted to hear for a long time! The REAL Queensryche with the three founding members Michael Wilton, Scott Rockenfield and Michael Wilton (yes, Geoff Tate was never a founding member) along with guitarrist Parker Lundgren and the new singer Todd La Torre. And La Torre is awesome! Again, go check on YouTube. But I have to tell you: you're gonna be very pleased!\n\nQueensryche's new album is set to be released on June 11th, and it's gonna be what the fans are waiting for a really long time: a Queensryche record.";ATROCIOUS
249;18.0;1.0;51.0;"As most of us know there are presently two Queensryche's running around.\nOne with three original members and one with former vocalist Geoff Tate and a bunch of hired guns.\nI really wanted to root for both but it's clear from this release that it was simply rushed to the market in a legal game of ""who's first"".\nThe sound is horrid.\nThe songs are basically outdated nu metal.\nLyrics are juvenile.\nGeoff sounds strained and uninterested.\nSorry but this would have been much better as a solo effort.\nThe other (real) Queensryche album comes out June 11th.\nI'll be looking forward to what they bring to the table.\nTheir new song Redemption is classic Queensryche.\nF.U. is just that, a cheap shot at his former band mates and sadly also at longtime fans.\nNot recommended.";Insulting.
180;19.0;1.0;50.0;Now, judging from the reviews, it's apparent that the majority of the reviewers have an allegiance to one side or the other. Most reviewers gave it 1 star, with 20 others giving it 5 stars. Why else would 20 people actually rate this album 5 stars? Come on, seriously, 5 stars? So, there are 20 people that are going to claim that this is one of the greatest QR albums to date?  It's quite obvious that those people are Geoff Tate loyalists, nothing more. They're just defending their guy by giving him 5 stars.\n\nI listened to the album, and there's nothing special at all about it. There's a few good guitar riffs and solos, but Geoff is the weakest link on the album. The guest musicians do an adequate job, but nothing spectacular. Some of the guitar solos are OK, but others seem out of place. As everyone already knows, the mix of the album has had major issues. There's a remix version of the album out as well.\n\nWith Tate's known dislike for heavy metal, this album comes across as very contrived. It's not an album he WANTED to release, but one he thought he HAD to release to compete with the real QR. If this was a GT solo album (withouth the QR re-recordings), I could have possibly given this album 3 stars. But since he's releasing it as a QR album, I just can't do it. I was going to give him 2 stars for it, but the abomination of the re-recordings of the 4 classic QR songs was enough to push me to give this album 1 star. It's just a forgettable album, and will soon be forgotten in the QR legacy.;Geoff Tate contrived metal
183;20.0;1.0;50.0;Tate boasted openly regarding how he wrote, produced, and recorded this album in just six weeks. After listening to it such idea becomes more than clear: such a rush produced a bad album in each and every aspect. Tasteless, lost, bad sound. He might have put out an album before his ex bandmates, but he did not win the race.;Bad...bad...bad...
252;21.0;1.0;50.0;"I have heard the initial samples Cleopatra posted that are presumably the mixes on the CD's out for sale now. The label said there were ""sonic issues"" and hired an outsider to remix the whole thing but quit after one day because he had other priorities that included a William Shatner solo album. Pretty bad when you get bumped by the Shat. Would that mean Geoff was Shat on? Cleopatra, claiming to embrace ""democratic choice""  say they are going to release the version with the self admitted ""sonic issues"" and then later they would release the re-mixed version. This is three weeks before the scheduled release they are scrambling to remix this catastrophe.  Cleopatra then unveils the presumably remixed version in its entirety on Soundcloud only to be taken down a couple hours later after a flood of negative feedback. I guess Cleopatra didn't want all that easily Google-able bad press out there the week before this turd is supposed to drop. Sadly Cleopatra did not do their homework or they would have found that Queensryche has one of the most loyal fan bases of any band. They might have reconsidered their marketing strategy and not played the fans as fools.  I listened to the streamed version. Sadly you can bring the pig back in the barn and put some lipstick and a dress on it on it but it's still a pig... in a nice dress. The four re-recorded songs are just sacrilege and deserve no further attention. The rest of the CD which filled with co-writers and  it the parade of guest players. There a few nuggets that if in the hands of anyone else might be cool. But most of the CD sounds like they loaded a bunch of notes in a musical shotgun and blast the listener in the face. Not much in the way of melodies and hooks. Lots of masturbatory guitar solos that don't fit the rest of the song. For me the one song that could have been something really cool was the ballad, Weight of the World. This recording has it's issues but it is a pretty cool song. Having said that it is NOT a Queensrcyhe song it is a Geoff Tate and friends solo project song. The whole album is a Geoff Tate album, NOT a Queensryche album and he would have been better off to have just called it that from the get go. I have been a fan of ""Queensryche"" for 30 years and sadly this will be the 1st thing with the Queensryche name on it that I will not be buying. I am going to save my money and wait until June 11th when the Real Queensrcyhe album drops, it sounds like its gonna rock! It's gonna sounds like Queensryche.";This is NOT Queensryche
185;22.0;1.0;49.0;"""Geoff Tate - The Voice of Queensrche"", ""Queensrche starring Geoff Tate"", or just ""Queensrche""...\n\nThere are sure to be many people unfamiliar with Queensrche's current situation.\n\nVocalist Geoff Tate was fired from the band in early 2012 amid allegations of everything from dubious business practices and creative obstruction to assault and violent behavior.\n\nIn October 2012, a Washington state judge determined that 2 musical entities named "" Queensrche"" could exist until November 18th of this year, when the court is due to settle the legal entitlement to the Queensrche name.\n\nGeoff Tate wasted no time, assembled his own version of Queensrche (before the initial court judgment!) - including former members of his pre-Ryche band Myth and Heavy Metal ""hired guns"" Rudy Sarzo and Simon Wright, and set about recording a new album, entitled `Frequency Unknown'.\n\nNot content with the an ""all star"" line-up it appears that Geoff Tate pulled out all the stops in assembling a vast array of guest musicians to play on the album, all heavy weights in the world of Metal - K.K. Downing, Paul Bostaph, Chris Poland, Ty Tabor & Craig Locicero to name a few. Impressive, and surely a portent of great things to come.\n\nWell, not exactly. You only have to glance at the writing credits to see that his band of all stars have contributed nothing in terms of writing, with nearly all of the credits going to Tate and his long term collaborator Jason Slater.\n\nA couple of new names are thrown in there - most notably Lukas Rossi, winner of the US TV reality series `Rock Star: Supernova'. The writing and recording can't have taken more than 2-3 months and the frankly childish cover art has been lifted straight from Savatage's 1985 album `Power Of The Night'.\n\nMusically this album might have sounded edgy and heavy in the late 90s, but the material lacks the punch or originality to sound relevant today.\n\nThere's also a total lack of focus and cohesion in the material - `Give It To You' is by the numbers post-Grunge radio rock trading on a half baked Jerry Cantrell chorus riff, the aptly titled `Running Backwards' sounds like some kind of early 2000s nu-metal cast off, while a track like `The Weight of World' is desperately trying to recapture the epic feel of something from `Hear In The New Frontier' and failing miserably in all departments - most notably in the intro's soaring vocals.\n\nUnsurprisingly there's nothing reminiscent of the 1980s glory days (except the re-recordings, of which I'll come to later), nothing that could be considered remotely progressive, with alot of the material coming across as amped up Screaming Trees B-sides!\n\nThinly veiled references to his acrimonious split with his former band mates are evident throughout the lyrics, Tate coming across like jilted ex-lover unwilling to move on from a failed relationship - ""you wouldn't dare hurt me or you might just get hurt yourself"".\n\nThe title shortened to ""F.U."" on the cover is immediate evidence of the lyrical ""subtlety "" on offer, but the lyrics are far from Geoff's only low point - the vocal delivery is strained and flat.\n\nGone is the range and power of a vocalist who was once held in the same esteem as Dickinson and Halford, and in its place some kind of crooning lounge lizard shadow of his former self.\n\nAlot was promised before the release of this album. The phrase ""stupidly heavy"" was bandied about, and with an impressive list of guest players there had to be something of merit on the album.\n\nWell, again no, I've yet to discern exactly who plays what on which track. There's a couple of technically proficient guitar solo's throughout, even a bit of decent shredding, but its lacks any personality and for the most part they are completely out of place on whatever song they're tacked on to - see track 4 `Slave'.\n\nThey're the very definition of phoned-in.\n\nI think Ty Tabor may have performed the solo on `Running Backwards'. it's somewhat reminiscent of something he did on `The Jelly Jam', but I couldn't be sure.\n\nApparently Paul Bostaph played on there somewhere, but there's no fills, patterns, unique or demanding drumming performance that would suggest this actually happened.\n\nI'm still looking for Poland and Downing's lead breaks - maybe `Give It To You' or `The Weight Of The World'. Who knows? One thing is for sure, playing on this album won't be on top of any of the guest players CVs anytime soon.\n\nThe production isn't quite a bad as I expected after hearing initial preview tracks, but it's still sub-par. The guitars sound DI'd without correct modeling applied and what intricate lead work there is, is buried in the mix beneath everything else. The drums are flat and lifeless with no definition in the toms.\n\nSaving the best 'til last, lets talk about the ""bonus"" tracks - 4 re-recordings of classic Queensrche hits.\n\nNow, this is something Def Leppard managed to do successfully quite recently, so it can be done - but these cod-karaoke, de-tuned versions really highlight the inadequacies in Tate's version of Queensrche. Shoulder to shoulder with the originals they are an abomination.\n\nAfter repeated listens I'm finding it hard to have anything positive to say about `Frequency Unknown', if it was a demo release from a no name, pub circuit band it would receive an average mark for competency. Nothing more.\n\nThe songs are instantly forgettable, un-original, bland and the kind of stock material you might hear in an emotional scene in a TV show like One Tree Hill - see `Life Without You'.\n\nThere's a definite Nu-Metal vibe throughout, despite the credentials of the guest players, and it gives the impression that Tate and his writing team hasn't heard a new, relevant Metal album in 10-15 years.\n\nTate has probably been too busy with his latest vintage of Insania or riding his motorcycle to keep up with the latest advances in rock & metal.\n\nThough there's probably a couple of hundred Geoff Tate Queensrche fans that will lap it up as a result of sheer blind devotion, in reality it is a rushed, mid tempo piece of **** with more ex-members of Dio and Myth than members of Queensrche.\n\nUltimately `Frequency Unknown' doesn't really know what it wants to be as a creative entity.\n\nIt could be argued that its only purpose is a cynical attempt by Geoff Tate to prove his entitlement to the brand name by having an album out first, or to damage the Queensrche brand if he loses the court case in November.\n\nIt'll be interesting to hear what the remaining original 3 members of Queensrche come up with on their as yet untitled new album due on June 11th - regardless of what they release it won't be too hard for them to top Geoff Tate's ""vision"" of Queensrche!";Failure Unavoidable
184;23.0;1.0;47.0;I feel duped! After having bought what I thought was going to be a new Queensryche CD, I open it to instead find a collection of mediocre songs apparently crafted (and I use that word lightly) by virtually no one actually associated with what I've known to be QR. These songs are not at all representative of the body of work of Queensryche, save for the fading voice of Geoff Tate. And let's be honest, his voice is not what it once was.\n\nAfter listening to songs that didn't have the vibe, timing or chord structure of Queensryche, I looked further to see a myriad of guest artists and writers, instead of the old band. Baffled, I decided to research this further and found that the actual remaining original bandmembers, Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson, had fired Geoff Tate, and hired an up and coming vocalist to take his place.  After listening to the clips online of the real QR with new singer Todd La Torre, I once again feel good about this band.  Shame on Geoff for (and in my case successfully) pulling the wool over the eyes of the public. This should have just been a solo release. I guess if I had been a little more fanatical about QR, I would have known and hopefully avoided buying this. As it is, I feel duped and wish I could get my money back.;Duped!
239;24.0;1.0;47.0;Let's be honest, and serious. This is Geoff Tate's third solo effort...disguised as Queensryche.\n\nHe was fired because of his egotistical actions and bad leadership within Queensryche for the past decade or so. The Tateryche era consisting from Tribe until Dedicated to Chaos is a clear indicator that under the dictatorship of Geoff and his wife/manager Susan they have ruined the reputation of one of the greatest progressive rock acts of all time.\n\nIf you want further proof, listen to this album....if you dare.\n\nThere is nothing on Frequency Unknown that sounds remotely distinctive like Queensryche. This is a rushed and forced attempt by Geoff Tate himself to get ahead of his former bandmates to get a release with the Queensryche name before the hearing in November.\n\nIf Geoff thinks this was a sure fire move, he's wrong. Don't just read the reviews of F.U. here, scan the interwebs for further proof if you're still on the fence.\n\nIn June the ACTUAL Queensryche returns with a new album with a fresh new vocalist in Todd La Torre. As for Geoff Tate, he should have resigned from the band in 2004, plus given all his actions and remarks from the past year...I am simply done supporting him and his music.;NOT Queensryche
229;25.0;1.0;46.0;"Geoff Tate has never been the most approachable, or timid individual. Even back when he was a hero singer of mine their was just always something very narcissistic about the guy. He was very introverted and just acted like his S#%# didn't stink, but in a way that's why i ""use"" to think he was cool. Even though his voice was hated by many even back in the day for being annoying raspy and his high range being gruff, i still though he was the best. Even though on albums like The Warning i did find it a bit annoying that he sung high range on 98% of that album. After Empire i think things really started to go south for Queensryche, along with all the other bands like Metallica, Skid Row, Motley Crue, and many other rock and thrash bands that sold their soul to the grunge/alternative nation. But it wasn't just that, after Promise Land, QR's last good album, Geoff seemed to be losing his vocal ability, along with his writing skills. Then with the departure of Chris Degarmo, things just went straight to hell.\n\nQ2K was a disaster, Tribe was possibly even worse than this, is that can be done. The attempt at Mindcrime 2 was ok, but sound to forced, and American Soldier, well, was just plain boring. Ever since then the leading man has dropped down to a dismal, bitter 53 year old shaved headed, fat white dude, with an attitude. And this album proves that. Songs like Cold and Dare are just threat based songs to the ""real"" Queensryche, especially Eddie Jackson whom Tate always had issues with. As for the rest of the album, Tate tries to relive the glory days, horribly with songs like In The Hands Of God, by deliberately putting in keyboard overtones from Gonna Get Next To You. He fails miserably at this, and even his low toned ""are you ready?"" Rage For Order vocals just sound stupid as hell. The only song that has any kind of decent riff or chorus to it is Everything. Which should be called I Ruined Everything, by being a p#$#k and pulling a knife and threatening the lives of my former band mates.\n\nEven though Tate can't hit any really high range vocals anymore, he should be smart enough to just start a band called Tate, or the Geoff Tate Experience, or whatever. Frankly i could care less because him dragging the dear Queensryche name through the mud just adds insult to injury. Which he has a ton off. The album is also out of key, his vocals on many songs sound tone def, especially on the ballad track, The Weight Of The World. Which sounds like your in for a treat, but goes nowhere but down fast. Also putting the great classic songs like Silent Lucidity, Jet City Woman and Empire (among others) through the re-recording process, WHY? Oh i forgot, his corporate greed. Just pathetic sounding. And we all know, especially fans of the band, that he deliberately called the band FU, with a fist on the cover with the symbol in the middle to tell the boys. Hey i AM Queensryche, bzzzzzzzzzzzzt WRONG. Your nothing Geoff, just a washed up old fool who made a self inflicted parody of yourself by trying to rush out a crap album under the QR name before the real guys take you down. Todd La Torre is great, and not just a clone either. The way Redemption sounds is all natural, raw, high energy sounding Queensryche from back in the Mindcrime and Empire days. And i can't WAIT for it to crush this and put him in his place.\n\nThis rates (to me) as one of the WORST meta/rock albums in history, along side Metallicas St. Anger. And this is about one of the only albums you will find nearly all 1 and 2 star reviews on. This guy knew what he was setting himself up for, and he did it anyways. This guys has balls the size of Mt Everest. It's a shame this album doesn't show them.\n\nHorrible album, horrible production, horrible vocals, I think i rest my case, yes?";Egoryche
230;26.0;1.0;46.0;"I had originally typed out a long detailed review, but after re-reading it several times, I think it can be best summed up as follows.  This is one of those albums where you listen (most likely while cringing) to it and you think, how is it possible that professional musicians who do this for a living, listened back to the final version and said, ""I am willing to not only let other people hear this, but I'm proud to put my name on it as well""?  Truly embarrassing for all involved, the record company, musicians, producer, mastering engineer, and even the listener.";Truly Awful
231;27.0;1.0;43.0;"I would have preferred that Geoff Tate remain in Queensryche and that he still had the voice and desire to return to the style of the Queensryche we all know and love, the Queensryche prior to Q2K. I would also have preferred him to get along with the rest of his band and treat them with the respect they deserve. I would very much prefer that he was not so set on using outside writers to create music that is, at best, uninspired.\n\nNone of these things seem possible.\n\nSo we have this disc. It is unfortunate on so many levels. I won't go into the details, as many of the reviews outline the low points (the re-recorded QR tracks in particular are abhorrent) nicely, but I would like to know WHY Geoff is so set on trying to put out a ""metal"" record. It is so clear from the hack-job on here that he is not into it AT ALL, and doesn't even understand the concept. Why would he not just branch off into a solo career where he can sing the kind of music HE is interested in and not create this half-baked attempt to hold on to a band name he really only wants to sell more records and concert tickets? This album is a transparent cash grab, and one that can only fail. It has ruined his reputation and soiled the name of Queensryche.\n\nGeoff had the opportunity to branch off into a potentially exciting non-metal solo career. He can still sing in a lower range and a different style might suit this nicely. I hope he drops this ridiculous concept and just does what he is passionate about. There is no passion here. Only one man desperately trying to hold on to something that he doesn't even really understand. It is sad and it is reflected in the music on this disc.";A new low
226;28.0;1.0;42.0;Lyrist & singer Geoff Tate has in part created yet another solo album with the help of producer and main songwriter Jason Slater.  The album sounds rushed, uninspired and is terribly mixed.  Some of the songs have some good ideas though.  It could have been a decent solo effort if more time and care went into producing it, just doesn't call it Queensryche.  Queensryche in their best days were a BAND, not just one person.;Yet another GT solo album
232;29.0;1.0;42.0;"The cover is an obvious stab at Wilton, Jackson and Rockenfield. You can also take it as a slam against the fans. Notice the Ryche symbol on the middle finger? Exactly. Also, it's a total rip off of a Savatage album from 1985. The point here is the artwork is as unoriginal and lame as the music that follows it.\n\nThe songs really sound horrible, unimagined and rehashed from Slater's vault of whatever riffs he had lying around. This humiliating issue sounds like it was recorded as quickly as possible so Jeff could get something out before the other band known as Queensryche.\n\nWhat truly disappointed me was the re-recordings. When I heard ""Empire"", I lost my temper. Listen to the original. Then listen to a sample of the re-recording. The drums sound like they were recorded in Garageband on an iPad or on a live kit in a bathroom stall. The guitars are dry and lack any sense of personality. The vocals... I'm not even going to touch that. There's enough Tate bashing to read above in other reviews.\n\nThis abomination shows how bad Jeff's voice has become over the years with drinking and smoking. It  also proves he's trying his best to ruin what's left of the Queensryche legacy. Shame on you, Tate.\n\nSave yourself $10.";BLASHPHEMY!
190;30.0;1.0;41.0;"While ""Promised Land"" was a dramatic departure from their first five albums, there was still passion, great musicianship, and an intelligent approach to hard rock/metal that put QR above and beyond their peers.  But starting with Hear in the Now Frontier, it was obvious the bloom was off the rose.  I listened to the album several times hoping it would grow on me, but it never did.  With each subsequent album I went through the five stages of grief... hoping the next one would be a glorious return to form. But it never happened.\n\nI had given up hope that QR would ever see a resurgence in creativity.  I didn't follow the band closely enough during this time to understand why this once great act had turned into a tired, mediocre rock band that was just going through the motions with tired songs, tired vocals, and none of the creative spark that made me fall in love with them after the first time I saw the video for ""Eyes of a Stranger"" way back when.\n\nWith Frequency Unknown (FU, get it? har har), the answer is clear.  Even if you haven't been following the legal drama following Tate's ouster last year, it's obvious who is largely responsible for QR's decline since the mid 90s.  This album follows the same trajectory as Mindcrime 2, American Soldier, Dedicated to Chaos, and Tate's solo effort Kings & Thieves. It's another collection of mediocre, midtempo tunes that go nowhere, anchored with dull melodies.\n\nApparently this album was a bit of a rush job due to the legal battle between the two opposing Queensryches.  Now, sometimes that sort of urgency can turn out great art.  But just as often it can result in a hurried mess with no sense of cohesion or artistic vision.  Frequency Unknown is the latter.  On several occasions there are awkward transitions from verse to chorus or chorus to solo that had me scratching my head - as if Tate and his producer had two riffs they needed to stitch together but weren't quite sure how, so they just took a stab in the dark and called it a day.\n\nThe battalion of guest musicians involved - while talented in their own right for the most part - leave the album sounding generic due to the lack of a cohesive band effort.  Some of my favorite parts of the early QR material were the ""trade off"" solos between DeGarmo and Wilton.  None of that exists here.  While many of the solos are competently done, they don't add to the songs in any sense, and in some cases detract significantly (""Cold"" comes to mind)\n\nThe new material is not actively offensive.  That's about the best I can say about it.  It's just boring.  There's a handful of bright spots... ""In the Hands of God"" is probably the strongest track on the album, and comes the closest to sounding like vintage Queensryche, but it gets hamstrung by Tate's flat delivery in the chorus.  ""Slave"" has a decent opening riff, but is quickly rendered toothless by Geoff's tough guy posturing.\n\nThe re-recorded material is a different story entirely.  I'm a rare breed that enjoys re-recorded hits from my favorite bands.  There's usually two different approaches taken when re-records are done - Styx's ""Regeneration"" is an example of the first approach, which is to try to duplicate the original recordings as closely as possible.  The second approach is to modernize the originals somewhat with beefier production - like Kiss' ""Kiss Klassics.""\n\nTate has apparently decided to go a third route - use a karaoke version of the songs with a one-shot vocal take while battling a cold.  I can't imagine any artist who takes any amount of pride in their work doing such a pitiful job as these versions of Mindcrime and Empire classics.  The drums are obviously programmed, the guitar parts are poor approximations of the originals, the solos are outright terrible (tapping in Jet City Woman?  Just, no), the background vocals sound like something off of Kidz Bop, and the lead vocal delivery is objectively, indisputably poor.  Tate is completely off pitch in many instances, particularly ""Silent Lucidity.""  I can't imagine this was anything other than a bald-faced cash grab on his part done with the least amount of effort possible.\n\nIt would be one thing if he decided to take a completely different approach for the classics - then he would get some leeway from the fans.  But these are obviously meant to sound like the originals - it was just done so very poorly.\n\nDue to that final ""F.U."" to the fans of the original material, this album which would otherwise merit two stars gets dragged down to one.  Just an embarrassment all around.";If you like what Queensryche has done after Tribe, you'll like this....
218;31.0;1.0;41.0;"First, please do not be fooled into believing that this is Queensryche's newest release - that eagerly anticipated return to form comes out on June 11th. This is yet another godawful Geoff Tate project, not even a ""band"" collaboration.  Geoff's partner in crime (and I mean that literally, what is happening here is a crime against the Queensryche fanbase as well as music in general) Jason Slater, gave Geoff some of his shelved songs to warble over. Oh yeah, a couple other ""writers"" were involved as well. What a disgusting mess this is.\n\nThe songs, production, and performances are truly hideous. I'm ashamed to say that some of my (former) favorite musicians have lowered themselves to playing on this laughable project. I'm lookin' at YOU: Craig Locicero, Paul Bostaph, and Chris Poland - I have lost all respect for each of you as musicians for being involved. I don't care if it was done as a favor, or for a quick buck - shame on you.\n\nAs far as the ""music"" - it is not even good, let alone ""Queensryche"". This album follows in a long line of Tate / Slater debacles, both under the QR banner, as well as GT solo. These two are the hacks that are responsible for such utter tripe as Operation Mindcrine 2, Dedicated to Chaos, etc.\n\nI am so overjoyed that Geoff Tate will no longer be ruining the REAL Queensryche (again, their album drops 6/11/13 through Century Media), and this release proves just how responsible he was for their downfall.\n\nNo worries - once the REAL Queensryche releases their album, the truth will be known. All will be right with the world, and we'll look back on this joke of an attempt by Geoff Tate to damage their legacy and laugh in his face.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM - IT IS NOT QUEENSRYCHE.\n\nTHE REAL QUEENSRYCHE ALBUM WILL BE RELEASED 6/11/13 THROUGH CENTURY MEDIA RECORDS.";NOT Queensryche...

Cold has a catchy hook but Tate's vocals ruin it.  This is not Queensryche.  I've been a huge fan of QR since the beginning and I totally stopped listening to them after Hear in the Now Frontier.  That album totally turned me off to them.  Chris Degarmo knew they were going in the toilet.  I'm so happy to see that the guys in the real Queensryche, you know the ones who still own 3/4 of the company are moving on with a fantastic singer and the real QR album will be released on june 11th.

You can tell Jason Slater had his hands all over this because it sounds bland and uninspired, like all the other Queensryche projects he's ruined in the last few years.\n\nGeoff doesn't sound horrible, but he's lost a ton of range and his heart doesn't seem to be in it anymore. I'm not sure what happened to his ability to write good lyrics. You could notice a difference after Chris left on Q2K, he started writing about his sex life with Susan and it has become progressively worse. The lyrics on FU have more in common with Brett Micheals than they do Queensryche.\n\nSorry this doesn't deserve more than one star and even that is pushing it.;What an Embarrassment to the Queensryche name.
208;37.0;1.0;38.0;"If this album said ""Geoff Tate"" on the cover, rather than ""Queensryche,"" I'd probably give it two stars. Every song has some interesting musical ideas that, had they been properly developed, performed and recorded, could have resulted in a good album. A good Geoff Tate album, that is. Geoff Tate by himself is NOT Queensryche, and this is NOT a Queensryche album. It's lumpy, middle-of-the-road ""bro rock"" that would have been radio friendly in, say, 2002. There is nothing here remotely at the level of Rage For Order or Operation Mindcrime. It's a ""Musiccrime"" to even compare it to those classics.\n\nNot only does Tate crap all over the good name of Queensryche with this release, but he does himself a disservice. The album was rushed to completion in six weeks, and it sounds like it. Songs are not developed. The recording quality and mix are dreadful. The performances are nothing to write home about, and Tate's vocals are horrible. The man was once the best vocalist in metal, but his voice is shot. Not only does he not have range anymore, but his pitch control and tone have left him. He's done as a rock vocalist, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe if he had taken time to get his voice back in some semblance of shape, he could have salvaged this album with decent vocal performances. But alas, that's not the case. He's by far the weakest performer on his own album.\n\nThe re-records of the classic Queensryche songs at the end of the album are an embarrassment on all levels. Simply terrible.\n\nLook, I can't tell you not to buy this product. You have freewill. But I urge you to give it a listen on Spotify or on YouTube rips before you plunk down any money for it. It's bad.";It's not Queensryche, and it's not good
173;38.0;1.0;37.0;"What a shame to see and hear what's become of one of the greatest rock vocalists in the history of the genre. From a ground-breaking true BAND of top-shelf musicians who worked together to craft some of the finest hard rock and metal music ever to this sad parody of their former greatness, all due 100% to the absolutely out-of-control megalomania, delusion and now LEGENDARY douchebaggery of Geoff Tate. First he drove Chris DeGarmo, the band's best musical composer - BY FAR - out of the band. Then, slowly but surely, his insidious need to feed his own bloated, insane ego leeched the life out of what was left of the band until finally, they were nothing more than a glorified solo band that SHOULD be called ""The Geoff Tate Experience"" instead of ""Queensryche"", and the ENTIRE rest of the band finally could take no more of his physical, psychological and verbal abuse and followed DeGarmo in telling this LOON to go screw himself. Then the petulance TRULY began, and now we're saddled with TWO (not really) ""Queensryches"", one of which still contains most of the original band and actually still SOUNDS like Queensryche, the other an empty, pathetic shell of itself and a cheesy, tired rock cabaret act fronted by Tate, who lost half of his once legendary range over a decade ago to cigarettes and now has to resort to the Don Dokken tactic of turning the mic to the crowd live whenever a high part comes up that he can no longer sing. I really used to look up to and admire this guy, too. One look at his EPK on Youtube will tell you just how batshit insane this man has truly become and why, at the very least, he DID manage to name his brand of wine correctly with the name ""Insania"". Most autobiographical wine name EVER.\n\nThen we get on to this steaming pile of sub-mediocrity, the third Tate solo record, and the second one in a row he's had the gall to attempt to pass off to OG fans as a ""Queensryche"" record. Seriously, if you've rated this contrived, tired and just plain BAD record at anything above two stars, you're nothing more than a drooling, mouth-breathing sycophant who would give Geoff Tate 5 stars if he released a 50 minute disc of him breaking wind, something this record comes awfully close to as it is. The songs are more of the same tired ""Queensryche-Lite"" cabaret act that Tate has been pedaling to universally terrible reviews and ever-dwindling audiences for years now that he's just too eaten up with himself to realize that NO ONE wants to hear. The production is GODAWFUL, the grainy, thin guitar tones are HORRID, and the ""covers"" at the end are a true testament to just how much of his once mighty voice he's lost, and just how sterile, uninspiring, unimaginative and freaking TIRED his act has become.\n\nJust STOP, Geoff, seriously. It's bad enough you drove off the ENTIRE BAND, but to continue to fart out this listless, lifeless, vapid, incosequential POOT under the name ""Queensryche"" is just plain SAD, and you're ruining every last bit of not just YOUR legacy, but the legacies of those who helped build it with you in the first place. But if there's one thing you've conclusively proven, it's that you don't give half a damn about anyone but YOURSELF, and have no compunction whatsoever when it comes to pissing all over the fans who made you rich and successful in the first place. Drop the name already while at least the REAL Queensryche still stands some chance of salvaging it, and by extension - YOU, before it's too late.\n\nAlso, seek serious, professional psychiatric help, bro, because the cheese has slid from your cracker, if you catch my drift...";The cheese has officially slid from Tate's cracker...

150;40.0;2.0;36.0;"Ok, first off, let me say that Geoff Tate's camp and Cleopatra records should be embarrassed at how silly their ""Reviews"" actually sound. 5 stars?! Really? Come on, all of you must think we Queensryche fans are complete idiots. At least make it 3 or 4 stars to make it somewhat realistic. There are plenty of 3 or 4 star albums that are very enjoyable to listen to. But 5 stars for 'Frequency Unknown""? Give me a break. I'm gonna sound like everyone else on here, but that's because all the things we're saying are TRUE!\n\n  This is NOT a Queensryche album, not even close. Is it better than 'Dedicated to Chaos' and 'American Soldier'? Yes, but that doesn't say much. Yes, the mixing is possibly the worst in recorded history. (Note to Cleopatra records: Don't offer a remixed product after admitting it's awful, then post fake reviews on Amazon praising the product.) As many have rightly pointed out there are some decent musical ideas here, but none of them get fleshed out or even given enough attention to be sustained for a full song. The list of guest musicians is indeed impressive, but what good is having Brad Gillis (Just an example) play if he's just gonna perform a random solo that gets dropped in the middle of a song that has no relation or resemblance to that solo? Again, as many have noted 'Cold' is the best song on here, and it's a good song. It's the best solo song Tate's ever done, and it's the closest this album has to a complete song, but even that's pushing it. 'In the Hands of God' is a decent song as well. MAYBE, if this were marketed as a Geoff Tate solo project, the positives that are present on 'F.U.' may be more well recieved, as few and far between as they are.\n\n  But even my trying to be objective gets tossed out the window as soon as I heard the re-recordings of the 4 classic Queensryche songs. I'm angry, no, infuriated, that Mr. Tate thinks so little of us, his fans, that he can butcher songs that mean so much to so many, for a quick cash-grab and that we would accept it. This is where I draw my line. I understand what happened between Tate and the other four members, but for Tate to disrespect us the Queensryche fans by desecrating these songs and obviously not caring how they turned out is far worse than him spitting on Scott Rockenfield. I could go on rehashing what so many others have already said, but I'm gona wrap this up.\n\n  'F.U.' is bad, not awful, but bad. It's certainly not Queeensryche, and to market it as such is disrespectful to all of us who have loved what the band stood for from the beginning. Queensryche would NEVER have allowed a product so sloppy, muddy, and unfinished to be released to the fans. That's one of the reasons I, and so many others have loved this band. Finally, Geoff Tate was one of, if not THE best metal/hard rock singers in the history of the genre. Sadly, those days have passed, and he has not been able to competently sing for many years. There's no shame in that. We all get older and are unable to do things we once did. But for him to continuously try to cover that fact up, combined with his actions and attitude, is only hurting his once glorious (And justified) reputation. We Queensryche fans are loyal, dedicated, and in keeping with what the band once was, intelligent. We don't buy the act Mr. Tate. We've heard 'F.U.' and we've heard 'Redemption', and every single one of us (not on your payroll or working for your record label) knows which one is Queesnsryche. No more Cabaret, no more 'Dedicated to Chaos', June 11th can't come fast enough because I, and all the other true fans out there, miss Queensryche. 'Frequency Unknown' isn't even close.\n\nADDITION: I just went back and listened to Geoff Tate on Eddie Trunk's radio show a few days ago. Tate cares so much about this album that when asked about all the big name guest musicians who played on it he said he didn't know who played what. Great musical integrity Geoff.";Amazon, please don't let employees of the artist and/or record company post reviews.
175;41.0;1.0;36.0;"Where to begin? Just when you thought that ""Dedicated to Chaos"" was the worst thing that Queensryche could put its name on, Geoff Tate and his hired guns (not an original member to be found here) have outdone themselves.\n\nWhatever happened between the two versions of the band is history, but this recording is a joke. It's not that it's a just a bad Ryche album, it's just a mess in general. ""Cold"" is the one okay song on the album. It sounds nothing like Ryche, but if you like bad knockoffs of the band ""Creed"" and guitar solos that sound like they were lifted from entirely different songs, then this one will be right up your alley.\n\nThe re-recorded songs do nothing more than expose the fact that Geoff's voice is clearly not what it used to be. A prime example is ""I Don't Believe in Love."" It literally sounds like a karaoke version of the song sung by a guy whose drunk buddies insist that he sounds ""just like Tate, duuuuuuuuude!""\n\nHere's hoping the offering from Todd LaTorre fronted version of the band comes closer to hitting the mark of what a Queensryche album should sound like.

The ""covers"" of classic tracks were an admitted money grab and they've been horribly, horribly murdered.

160;45.0;1.0;35.0;"All you need to know about just how weak this album is is by looking at what the record label is doing with it. Before this abomination was even available to hear in its entirety, Cleopatra had to remix it because the samples were so god-awful and universally trashed that if left to its own devices, the album would have sold to however many members there are in the Tate family tree as well as employee's and close friends. Well, the bad news there is that they already had cd's pressed and ready to ship, so the label then comes up with the BRILLIANT idea of saying that they will offer 2 versions of this; the original mix and the remixed version at a later date. This is not a common practice, despite what Tater has tried to spin. Do albums get remixed & remastered, yes many years down the line, not days after they've already started pressing the discs. Now, you get the label saying that anyone who buys this claptrap and has a receipt can get the remixes for free. Never in my life have I seen a record of any kind that came "" some assembly required.""\n The fact that Tate's hatred and spite for his former bandmates has spurred the man to rush and completely half-ass this record is a serious disservice to the fans, and that includes those that are trying valiantly to defend this. There was not one damn reason this HAD to be done start-to-finish in 6 weeks as he's boasted. He's shown just how little he cares about this (and his fans) in a number of ways. He made a big deal about the stellar guest star lineup he had for this record, and yet in an interview with Eddie Trunk this past Friday, he can't even recall who all played on it or what they did.\n The last thing I'll touch on, and the less said here the better, is the soul crushingly awful re-records of the classic's. When you can't even manage to play the damned songs properly, and you have to actually use vocals from the original recordings to prop yourself up, you really shouldn't be doing it. The only reason for these abominations is this is all that Cleopatra was really concerned with and they in all probability wouldn't have touched this project without their inclusion for later use on umpteen compilation albums that Cleo has become known for";All you need to know....
191;46.0;1.0;35.0;I tried to write a more detailed review, but I'm having a hard time to come up with the right words.  Simply put:  THIS ALBUM IS HORRIBLE!!!!\n\nThe real Queensryche (releasing their own album on June 11th) will put this to shame.;Horrible
204;47.0;1.0;35.0;"Man, the autotune must have had smoke pouring out of it from having to work so hard! I got to hear the original samples, before they autotuned the crap out of it, and Geoff was out of tune a lot. It stills shows on the 'finished' versions. You can hear his voice getting yanked into place quite often (in some songs, every line!).\n\nSome of the music/playing is decent, but as usual, Geoff is the weak link. As soon as he starts singing, his voice and lyrics just kill it, and not in a good way. His voice has declined even further, and his newer style of singing is awful. It is hard to believe this guy was once an amazing vocalist. He is starting to remind me of Evander Holyfield... he just can't admit his talent is gone and it is time to retire.\n\nI honestly think that Geoff could improve his music if he 1)worked with a vocal coach to try and find what the hell happened to his voice, and why he can't sing in tune anymore. 2) Get as FAR away from Jason Slater as he can. It is no coincidence that the albums Jason has ""helped"" on have been reviewed as the worst Queensryche albums ever. Yet, album after album, Geoff keeps buying Jason's songs and throwing crappy lyrics and vocals on top of it and calling it Queensryche.\n\nThe REAL Queensryche are releasing their album on June 11th. I highly recommend people buy that one instead of this weak Geoff Tate solo release. It is a band written album/effort.... no outside writers, no Jason Slater, no Kelly Gray. It has great vocals. It has a real producer.";Dang!
220;48.0;3.0;35.0;"I'm Rik Johnston and I approve this message.\n\nThis album is not a Queensryche album.\n\nEverybody who isn't biased toward Camp Tate has already stated this.  This is probably the most true statement being said today regarding this album.  And the reason this isn't a Queensryche album is that one former member of Queensryche does not constitute the whole of Queensryche.  This band was always the sum of its parts, with no single member of the band asserting dominance or dominion over the rest.  This is what makes the bands early works such an essential part of anybody's collection of music, is that it was the creation of music by the band as a whole that made that music as powerful, as special, as thought-provoking, as varied, and as musically challenging than nearly anything their contemporaries put to market.  It was a band, working together as a band to write their music, and once outside writers were brought in, that is where the magic disappeared.\n\nSince 2005, Geoff Tate has opted to steer the ship exclusively in the direction he wanted to take it.  This is a matter of historical fact at this point.  It is also a matter of fact that Tate was fired last year when those particular tensions (amongst other business matters) came to a boiling point.  Tate was terminated from Queensryche, and has been bitter about it ever since.\n\nThis is the second release we have seen from Tate since his departure from the band.  While one could argue that he's put out two albums since his termination, I say that it's not the quantity of material that matters, it's the QUALITY of the material that matters.  As previously stated, Queensryche's music was always the creation of the sum of it's parts, and Tate by himself could never be Queensryche.\n\nWhich brings us directly to the topic at hand, Frequency Unknown.\n\nThis album is a collection of songs, largely culled from a library of back material by Jason Slater, with two new entries by Lukas Rossi.  The songs were written before Tate had any involvement in them, and he fashioned lyrics and vocal melodies to fit the needs of the songs he was trying to convey.  There was literally no band effort involved in the creation of this music, by Queensryche, or any other band.  There's an endless parade of guest musicians and vocalists on this album in an effort to glamorize this and distract the listener from what this truly is.\n\nIt can be argued until the cows come home what Geoff Tate's intention with this record is, from veiled threats on the cover and in the song Dare specifically, to his attempt to get this recording out before Queensryche Official does, or whether or not it's his final stage bow, but there's no denying that this is NOT a Queensryche album.\n\nAs for some of the songs, I like a few of them on the musical end very, very much.  But like Kings & Thieves and Dedicated to Chaos, I find Tate to be the weakest link on his OWN MATERIAL.  The defining qualities his voice once had are nothing more than a mere shadow of what they used to be, thin and weak, straining and raspy.  Gone is the smooth and powerful delivery he once had, which put him at the top of the metal vocalist mountain in his day.  But that day has come and gone.  After about 8 listens of this album (Yes Tom, I've listened 8 times to be fair.) its my opinion that, while some of the songs are decent, they lack that synergy that comes from creating music together as a team.  That is what Tate has lost sight of in his quest to become the dictator of all things Queensryche, the synergy of working as a team.\n\nTo conclude, here's how I place the songs.\n\nThe GOOD: ""In the Hands of God"", ""Fallen"" and ""Weight of the World"" ""Life Without You"".\nThe BAD: ""Cold"" ""Dare"" ""Slave"" ""Everything"" ""Give it to You""\nThe UGLY: ""Running Backward"" and the awful re-recorded versions of ""I Don't Believe in Love"", ""Jet City Woman"", ""Empire"" and ""Silent Lucidity""\n\nRik Johnston\n\n****EDIT****\n\nI admit that my initial review of this album was a bit harsh.  It didn't deserve the one star review that I gave it, because I will actually own up to saying how biased I was when I originally reviewed it.  While the words of the review still stand, and this album is indeed a grower, I've bumped it to three stars to reflect a more appropriate rating for it.  I feel that 3 stars is a fair rating for this album.";Product is rushed, and it shows, but the album is a grower.
161;49.0;1.0;34.0;"I actually was going to give this two stars because it exceeded my low expectations.  I think ""Cold"" is a pretty solid song despite the misplaced solo.  But I have to agree with most of the others here - it's a mishmash of stuff - the songs are really uneven within the songs themselves, let alone from song to song.\n\nThen I got to the remake of ""I Don't Believe in Love"" and ""Empire"" had to bump it down to one star.  If they'd remade the songs with a little something new, it could've been interesting.  Instead it sounds like a terrible cover band.  Insulting.  I'm glad I listened online before buying.\n\nI saw Tate recently and thought his version of the band sounded decent, so I was willing to give this a chance, but no, I'm back to holding out that the other Queensryche will deliver, this is just rushed junk.

And it sounds like an album that was made in less than 6 weeks.\nIt's better than Geoff Tate's Kings & Thieves, but only because he hired a billion people to write music for him. Because the only part of the original QR that's left in this mockery of a band can't write music. Yes folks, Geoff Tate is one of those ""musicians"" that can't actually write a song.\nThis album is mostly made by people that had no previous connection to Queensryche before. How can someone call this a Queensryche record is beyond me.";nope.
141;53.0;1.0;32.0;"I'm well aware of the drama that has been taking place in the Queensryche camp for the last two years. The divorce between Wilton & co. and Tate has been brutal; in fact, ugly really doesn't begin to describe it. Other reviewers have already given the detailed history report, so I won't go through that in my review. Here, I'm going to give a fair-minded subjective review.\n\nI wanted to like 'Frequency Unknown' desperately. Honestly, I really did. So for all of Geoff Tate's PR people that are going to trash me in the comments, understand that I really did give this a fair shot. I've listened to the album three times, and I hate to join the choir, but I feel I must say it: this is really awful. I hated 'Dedicated to Chaos,' but this makes 'Dedicated to Chaos' look like 'Operation: Mindcrime.' This record blows on all levels. Muddled sound, trite and dull lyrics, unimpressive musicianship (yes, not even KK Downing, Brad Gillis, Rudy Sarzo, Simon Wright, or Ty Tabor could rescue this Titanic-level shipwreck).\n\nThe re-recordings are as bad as you've heard on here, maybe worse. Here, Tate tries to play it safe and recapture the feel of the original recordings. He fails to do that. Not only does he fail, he fails MISERABLY. The production is sloppy, and it sounds like it was recorded in a portapotty using an old tape recorder. The sound is terrible.\n\nAnother complaint here is Tate's voice. To me, that's the least of the problems. I actually don't mind Tate's voice here. It's important to remember that he's no longer a 28-year old man. He's now 54. Sure, it doesn't have the power and strength that it once had, but I don't think his voice is anywhere near as bad as it is made out to be. It certainly has changed in the last 25 years, but really, that's to be expected. The one star review (as harsh as it may be) has nothing to do with Tate's voice.\n\nThe lyrics on this record are absolutely dreadful. Another reviewer wrote that they reminded one of a ""bad Nickelback song."" I couldn't say it any better myself; most of these songs would not be out of place on a Nickelback album, actually; in fact, you can actually close your eyes and imagine Chad Kroeger singing these songs in Tate's place. That's a scary, scary thought. It's a fear that I thought I'd never have with Queensryche. However, I should have seen it coming with 'Dedicated to Chaos.'\n\nThis was released so Tate (rather immaturely, I might add) could beat his former bandmates in releasing a Queensryche album. Truth be told, this couldn't be further from a Queensryche album. It is a Geoff Tate solo record by all accounts, with some top-notch guys playing along. It's really sad to think that Tate, once a great frontman and rock singer (and he still could be if he actually put some effort into the product he was releasing), has stooped this low. I guess it's been coming for a long time, but it's a darned shame, because once upon a time, the Queensryche name actually stood for high quality music. Now, Tate is only tarnishing the legacy of this great band.\n\nI had to play 'The Warning' after I got done playing this album for a second time, just to remind myself what the Queensryche name truly stands for.\n\nOverall, as much as it may seem otherwise, I so desperately wanted to like this album. Brad Gillis is one of my favorite guitarists of all-time; ditto for Rudy Sarzo as a bassist. And yes, as much as hardcore (and even casual) Queensryche fans may dislike him these days (and as despicable as his behavior has been in recent times), I still think Geoff Tate is a good singer. But really, it doesn't matter if you have some of the most talented musicians in the world playing (as in this case), if you have bad material and a terrible producer (in this case, Jason Slater, who was also responsible for the horrid 'Dedicated to Chaos') the product is still going to be crap. It's like putting expired cheese on a cheeseburger (for lack of a better analogy): if you dress the burger up with fresh lettuce, beef, tomato, and onions (or whatever else you like on your burger), it's still going to taste bad, because it still has past-its-prime cheese.\n\nAn aside: There is a remixed version of this that will be released at a later date. This album could really benefit from a good remix; guitar solos are haphazardly thrown into the mix without any care (so they sound out-of-place) and Tate seems to be singing behind the pace of the song at times as well. A remix could do this release some good (although not much, because the material is so weak and banal).\n\nI hate to do this, especially to musicians I have so much respect for, but I cannot recommend this. It pains me to do this, it really does. But listening to this album was a pretty painful experience for me (and from the sounds of it, many others). Queensryche fans deserve better than this garbage, and it is for this reason that I urge you not to buy this album. These guys could do so much better (yes, including Geoff Tate), and that's part of what is so frustrating about this album. It is clearly phoned in. No effort whatsoever.\n\nSpend your money elsewhere. This album sucks. One star is more than fitting.";I wanted so desperately to like this, I really did...
178;54.0;1.0;32.0;"This album really sucks!!! Record after record i hope this band will return to the glorious days when they made albums like ""Warning"", ""Rage"", ""Mindcrime"" and ""Empire"", but no, they deliver crap after crap; since ""Promised Land"" they've become boring, predictible and rockless, with the exception of ""mindcrime II"". The only song that's worth listening to is ""Slave"", but the rest of them are really bad. The sad thing is this is not the worst Rche album (Tribe and Dedicated to Chaos stink as well), so you can't hope a lot from the other version of the band.";Another really bad album from Queensrche
151;55.0;2.0;31.0;"Many of the reviews here seem to be written by people who haven't listened to the whole CD. Most QR fans have chosen to be either ""pro"" or ""anti"" Geoff Tate, and their review is clearly written out of either disgust or crazed idolatry. Well... I'll get to my views on the whole implosion of the classic Queensryche lineup later. But for now, the only question is... is this new album any good?\n\nLet me start by saying that unlike a lot of QR fans, I LOVED Tate's first solo CD. Seriously, it's in my top 12 CDs that I own. I randomly came across it at Fred Meyer one night... Having no idea that Tate had even recorded a solo CD, I had no idea what to expect. I was shocked and surprised to hear some kind of mellow rock-smooth-jazz hybrid that didn't sound at ALL like Queensryce (at the time.) It's a pretty quiet collection of songs for the most part, very well produced with just the right amount of heaviness. It was a very mature departure from the norm.\n\nI felt the need to mention Tate's first solo CD because that's basically the same way that you should look at Frequency Unknown... it's a solo album, regardless of what it states on the cover. It's Geoff Tate and a bunch of dudes. And as that, it's actually decent. It's definitely not as mind blowingly original as Rage for Order, and no the writing and arrangements are not nearly as intricate as Operation Mindcrime or even Promised Land. As a matter of fact, it tries really hard to be a contemporary rock CD and that's kind of where it fails. On just about every track, I found myself thinking ""oh that sounds like Creed"" or ""oh that sounds like Evanescence"" or (believe it or not) ""oh that sounds like The Cure."" But at no point did I say ""THAT sounds like Queensryche!!"" Frequency Unknown is basically: What if Geoff Tate was a guy no one had heard of and he was starting a band named Queensryche in 2003? That's not a typo... this music (with a few exceptions) sounds like stuff that Alternative Rock bands were doing 10 years ago. Only, this doesn't sound like a band... it sounds like a bunch of dudes.\n\nFor those of you who have been in a band before, you know what I mean. There's a certain synergy that happens when musicians get together and jam. Everyone comes into it with their own angle and their own experience... and if the chemistry is right, a ""bunch of dudes"" becomes something greater... they become a BAND. That's ultimately the biggest problem with this CD. There's no chemistry here. All of the music sounds bland and lifeless, like everybody literally came in, played what they were told, got paid and went back to their day jobs. There is no fire, no passion... And that's shocking since there are some A-list musicians on some of these tracks. But without looking at the liner notes, I dare you to find them. K.K Downing? Brad Gillis? WHERE??? Are they playing the triangle? Tambourine?? Without exception, every guitar solo on this CD is HORRIBLE. Notes are just played willy nilly with no direction, like each solo was recorded in one take. Seriously... every solo is a train wreck that could've been copy pasted into ANY of these tracks.\n\nOh as for the re-recorded tracks. I'm not sure what the point was. When a band gets a new lead singer, it's sometimes interesting to hear what the new guy sounds like singing the old classics, but the old singer with a new band-- when that new band isn't really a band at all-- well really, why? So we can all say ""Gosh, Geoff sure could sing better 25 years ago"" ??? And besides all of the comparisons, the production on these tracks once again sounds like they were recorded in one take, in somebody's bathroom. They sound like demos.\n\nSo, will the average QR fan like Frequency Unknown? Well, if you also like Creed and other late 90s rock bands then I'd say you'll like most of it. If you put the whole history of QR aside, this is an improvement on Dedicated to Chaos. It also helps if you've come to realize that Geoff Tate has been showing signs of a David Bowie influence for quite some time now. He's not nearly as fearless as Bowie, but Tate can do that moody ""Ashes to Ashes"" vocal delivery pretty well. If you're cool with that, then there are a handful of tracks that you'll like. ""In The Hands of God"" gets better every time that I listen to it, and ""Cold"" is a really solid single.\n\nBut let's face it, there are legions of QR fans that will crap all over this CD just because of the circumstances behind the scenes. Well, I'll wait until the OTHER Queensryche CD comes out in a few months to really get into that. But in the meanwhile, to all of the people who are defending THIS version of QR, I'll say this... When Rob Halford left Judas Priest and started another band, they weren't named Judas Priest. When Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden, his new band wasn't named Iron Maiden. Ozzy didn't start another Black Sabbath. David Lee Roth didn't try to take the Van Halen name with him (although that would've been pretty funny if he had.) When you are a singer and you leave a band (regardless of the circumstances) you've LEFT THE BAND. You are not the band, you were the lead singer. Now you are free to start another band and maybe they'll be bigger and better than your old band. But first, your new band needs to BECOME a band... not just a bunch of dudes.\n\nNeed evidence?\n\nQuick, name all of the current members of Guns n Roses.\n\nAxl Rose...\n\nand a bunch of dudes.";Classic QR is like geometry. THIS is simple addition & subtraction... BORING, and after awhile you'll wanna do something else.
176;56.0;1.0;31.0;Do not purchase this. Your ears will not forgive you. This never should have happened. Look away before it is too late.;awful
177;57.0;1.0;31.0;Jesus... this is one of the worst insults the band, or now the leadsinger solo, released under the name of Queensryche. This supposed to be funny? I stopped laughing a few albums ago and this one makes me wish for knitting-needles to be inserted down my ears. Especially the newly recorded 'classics' couldn't be of less quality. No drive, no spirit ...not even half-decent vocals by the man himself who sang the originals. The magic is gone and so am I... *rolleyes*;shocked and disappointed
182;58.0;1.0;31.0;I never thought I would say this, but Dedicated to Chaos is a better album! This album sounds like Kings & Thieves, just a little heavier but by no means better. The choruses and instrumental melodies are repetitive, the music is a cheap knock-off of 90s post-grunge rock, and Geoff's voice is as terrible as ever. I'm glad I got to hear the whole album before making a purchasing decision. Sorry for all you suckers that bought this swill.;Pure dredge!
222;59.0;1.0;31.0;What has happened to Queensryche?  I have been a fan since the early days but it keeps getting worse.  They now officially have more bad albums than good.  Refunding this purchase as this is unlistenable.  Geoff can't even sing anymore and the band sounds nothing like Queensryche.  Did Scott do his tracks on a drum machine?;Disappointing
224;60.0;1.0;31.0;...but, after listening to it via Cleopatra Records (brief) stream prior to release, I can safely say that I am not at all tempted to do so. Tate is by far the weakest link in this chain of shame.;I didn't buy this album...
59;61.0;5.0;30.0;I was walking down the sidewalk the other day and some guy pulled up next to me in a van.  I think he said his name was Jeff.  He looked sorta like the Genie from Aladdin.  Anyway, he offered me $5 to write a review saying this was the best record ever made.  Needless to say I was a little startled by the whole encounter, but I needed some money for lunch so I agreed - here it is:\n\nThis is without question the best record ever made.;Record of the year!  Ignore the haterz!
88;62.0;1.0;30.0;"I know a lot of reviews are out there, and this may be really late in adding to the discussion, but I just wanted to share these thoughts with the community here.  Up until a few days ago, I had only heard samples and very poor-quality versions of various songs from this album.  To me, to be fair, I wanted to be able to listen to the cd itself, from start to finish, and that's what I have finally been able to do (I'm actually listening to it as I write this).  I have no desire to add my thoughts on the re-records, or the quality of the performances by the various musicians on this release, as they seem irrelevant to me in the grander scheme of things.  I am also basing this review off of the ""original"" version of this album, and will not waste my time even trying to listen to the ""remixed"" version.  You boast and beat your chest about how great an album is, you brag about all the ""All Star"" guest musicians, well, you better deliver the goods right from the get-go.  Anything less or any excuses afterward are meaningless.  So, sorry if this is long-winded but, here we go...\n\n  In my opinion, ""Frequency Unknown"", from Geoff Tate's version of Queensryche, has been an utter disaster from day one.  But who even knows when ""Day one"" actually was for this album if you consider the many different outside writers used.  Most of these tunes sound very dated & cliche, which means they could have been written, literally, 5, 10, 15 years ago and have just been sitting around waiting for someone to record them.  For me, I would say ""Day One"" of this disaster, and the progressive downfall of Geoff Tate and the Queensryche image, started on the day Queensryche started the writing/recording sessions of Q2K.  From insights and stories we've heard over time, especially within the last 12 months, we know that this was the beginning of Geoff Tate's slow rise as ""leader and driver"" of the Queensryche sound, musical direction, and everything in-between.  It would also be the beginning of many wrong decisions and assumptions on Tate's part, the most glaring of which would be relying on outside writers and collaborators to ""define"" his idea of the Queensryche sound moving forward, so much so that he completely shut out any input from the other original band members.  Fast-forward to 2013.\n\n  In ""assuming"" he knew what Queensryche fans wanted, Tate set out to make a Metal album because he thought that that would make fans of ""classic Queensryche"" happy.  Wrong.  Again, just my opinion here but, classic Queensryche was not metal.  It wasn't rock, prog, alternative, industrial, or pop.  Classic Queensryche was a melting pot of all these genres and actually defined its own genre.  Thats what made them so special.  And for Tate & Co. to actually think this album is metal, or ""Stupidly Heavy"" as one of the guest musicians suggested, is even more absurd.  Far from it.  Calling this a metal album is an insult to the true metal community.  This is nothing but cliche, late-nineties, early 2000's, alternative/pop rock with an industrial/grunge twist thrown in here & there.\n\n  Fact is, and I apologize for the language and visual here but, this album sounds like it was written by Chad Kroeger, David Draiman, and Ben Moody one afternoon after a long night of drinking Insania and then banging each other with the empty bottles!  But I digress... So, lets talk about the songs themselves.\n\n  These songs actually aren't that bad if taken in for what they are, or are NOT to be more specific; they are not Queensryche songs.  They do not sound like Queensryche.  Granted, not much from the band over the past 10-15 years has sounded like Queensryche but, when reviewing this album, that matters a lot.  Tate deeply feels that he alone is Queensryche, devoid of any need of his previous bandmates, and should be the one to carry on the Queensryche name.  Scott, Eddie, and Whip disagree.  Since there will be ""at least"" two Queensryche albums offered to us this summer, which one sounds the most like Classic Queensryche means a lot to me, and this one does not.  So, when listening to these songs from the perspective of them not being Queensryche, they really aren't that bad.  I actually feel bad for Slater and any others that contributed these songs for this album because they were wasted.  Had many of these songs been given to real bands, allowed time to be rehearsed, fleshed out, and given proper lyrical & vocal melody treatments, they could have been excellent.  They just sound like so many other bands at different stages of their careers:\n\n  ""Cold""?  Could have been on Breaking Benjamin's debut.  ""Everything""?  Refer to above comment regarding Ben Moody (Evanescence).  ""Life Without You""?  Johnny Reznick could have made this a killer track on the Goo Goo Dolls ""Dizzy Up the Girl"" album.  ""Running Backwards""?  Sounds like a left-over from Cold's ""13 Ways to Bleed"" album.  I could go on & on.  Again, I actually feel bad for Slater & the other writers here because, even though they actually submitted music with a chance to be great, Tate is the weakest link of this entire project.\n\n  Its hard to believe that the same person that penned the lyrics to albums like OMC, RFO, Empire & PL is the same person here.  Lyrically, this is embarrassing.  Juvenile, amateurish, repetitive, cliche-laden, boring... I'm sure you all can add to this list of descriptions.  There really appears to be no true effort here.  Has Tate lost his imagination and muse, or was this just a result of trying to get this album done so quickly?  Hard to tell.  However, its insulting to pass this off to long-time fans as Queensryche.  What's even more insulting is the melodies he chose to sing these lyrics to and the effort he put into singing them; might as well use the same adjectives I used to describe the lyrics themselves and add flat, bland, and uninspired to the list.  We know that Tate isn't young anymore, we know he has lost his range.  But I also believe he still has a very powerful and soulful voice if only he'd take the time to re-learn his ""instrument"" and perfect what range he has; I've used Steve Perry's performance on Journey's Trial By Fire album as an example of this in the past.  Perry knew his range, perfected and honed it, and then delivered one of his best vocal performances on record.\n\n  I hear that the remixes sound better, and that ""Auto-Tune"" was used a bit.  To be honest, I'm not going to knock Tate for that.  It's a technology that is so commonplace in the industry these days, he'd be crazy not to use it to assist.  However, what he really needed was for someone to invent other, much needed studio effects like ""Auto-Professional"", ""Auto-Passionate"", and ""Auto-Make Me Sound Like I Actually Care!  Just lazy, half-hearted, emotionless performances and vocal melodies that ruin any chance these songs had to be memorable.\n\n  Finally, I will just say one thing about the production, or ""mix"", of this album since that has gotten a ton of attention.  There's nothing I can add that hasn't already been mentioned other than that ""Frequency Unknown"" is an apt title to this album since it sounds like everyone involved in the final mixing process was left scratching their heads, confused as to which frequencies in the spectrum to dial up & down properly.  I've heard better quality demos from High School kids recording through MacBooks & Berhinger equipment.\n\n  All in all, I still find myself humming some of these tunes when I least expect it (""Life Without You"" for some reason the most) and, if released as a Tate solo effort, I would say that ""Its not too bad, but nothing I see myself craving to listen to a month or two from now.""\n\n  But since it is branded with the Queensryche name, and I have certain expectations when it comes to one of my favorite bands, I find myself saying the same thing I have said after each release since Q2K, ""And so the downward spiral of this once great band continues...""\n\nAt least this time there may be hope on the horizon ;-)  Looking forward to June!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nOpi";Had potential but it was wasted for Tate's personal agenda
124;63.0;1.0;30.0;"After commenting on a few reviews here, I thought it only fair to put my effort in and offer it up for people to comment on or tear apart, whatever they feel is appropriate.  First off though, to satisfy the conspiracy theory paranoia that is floating around among the 'Cult of Tate', a disclaimer: I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the BDR forum.  Nor do I have Todd La Torre in my ear dictating this review.  Some may class me as a 'hater' but I say, not guilty - I prefer the less discriminatory term 'person with an alternative viewpoint'.  I am not posting this out of some imagined personal vendetta against Geoff Tate, I just want to make my thoughts known as a long time fan as the medium of the internet affords us way more of a voice than ever before.  Ok, so now I got that off my chest...\n\nI do not consider this a Queensryche record.  The evidence I present to support this theory is fairly strong. Firstly, the record was written by Geoff Tate and a team of external writers who have never been members of Queensryche (although, sadly, Jason Slater has been a negative influence for a while now...).  Secondly, the members of the 'band' that Geoff calls his Queensryche had minimal input to the album - keyboardist Randy Gane has a shared writing credit and only plays on 6 tracks (5 as a keyboardist), guitarists Robert Sarzo and Kelly Grey play only a solo on 1 track each, drummer Simon Wright has 2 tracks and the ever enthusiastic Rudy Sarzo has a grand total of 3 tracks.  Not really what you'd call a 'band effort'.  In fact, aside from any rehearsals, the current band will never have played any of these songs together.  With that in mind, how can you possibly call this a Queensryche album.  Ah, but as I write that line I can hear the usual suspects on the Facebook page that was hijacked all shout as one ""Geoff is Queensryche!""  Um, no...one man does not a band make.  Unfortunately, this is painfully evident in this release...\n\nI'll go on the record to say, I got this on the release date and I have given this a thorough listen through both speakers and headphones - I have lived with this album for a week to try and give an honest appraisal.  I'll start with - it is not as bad as Dedicated to Chaos.  Granted, that doesn't say much, but it is a start.  What we have here are ten new songs (or old castaway demos that have been sat on Jason Slater's shelves depending on who you listen to) and four re-recorded classics, which have proved the most controversial it would seem.  Let's start with the new songs...\n\nThere has been a lot of press around the production value and it is clear to anyone with an ounce of musicality that there are certainly issues.  The production being handled in a rushed and inconsistent way is clearly evident and the collection of songs sound more like a mix tape to me rather than a complete album.  Lead track Cold for example is totally different to Everything in terms of the mix and the balance of instruments, with the drums on the latter being compressed almost out of the track.  Even Cold is far from perfect, despite a remix by Anthony Focx, and this is noticeable particularly in the chorus where you have the distorted guitar overshadowing a clean, arpeggiated guitar and the keyboards as well as the vocals, which is a shame as it is actually a fairly catchy chorus.  The instruments just sound discordant as there is no clarity at all between them.\n\nHowever, it is the production of the re-recorded classics that is hard to swallow.  These tracks, once lovingly recorded by the musicians that wrote them in a professional studio, have now been relegated to being recorded by a mediocre sounding Argentine session guy using what sounds like a Line 6 POD device (possibly the POD Farm software) with overly digitized tones and a drum machine.  The person in question, Martin Irigoyen, plays the songs with none of the passion of the original recordings and there are plenty of phrasing and timing issues that the faithful are up in arms about.  But I think it is the general quality of the recordings that is really noticeable for being incredibly poor - they sounds like bedroom quality demos, not fit for a sampler CD to get gigs with, let alone a professional release.  And then we get to the vocal delivery...I'm sorry, but I was cringing.  Silent Lucidity is a particularly obvious example with pitching issues and flat notes aplenty.  How did this not get picked up by quality control?!\n\nEnough about the production though, what about the songs.  From a songwriting perspective whilst there is the odd tip of the hat to the older Queensryche, the Jason Slater and Geoff Tate mix has distorted this almost beyond recognition and the feel of the songs is more akin to Kings and Thieves or Dedicated to Chaos, only with the distortion of the guitars turned up a bit. Cold is probably the best song on the album, but while the chorus is catchy and reminiscent of Tribe era Queensryche, the 'heavy' riff just feels forced.  Other highlights would include In The Hands of God which reminds me a little of Q2K era Queensryche, but an interesting start just builds to a forgettable dirge of a chorus.  The songs Dare and Give It to You are just pure solo songs (so would fit on Dedicated to Chaos) and whilst some would say this is part of the 'evolution' of the sound and writing style, I would say that 'evolution' has already been proved to be a failed experiment.\n\nThis is my reasoning behind the title - what was great about Queensryche has been so diluted in recent years, hence the brand has depreciated.  This is the fault of everyone concerned and I'm not surprised things came to a head. I was hoping the split would re-energize both parties so that they would be able to flex their creativity in an unrestricted way, but whilst the remaining band members have done things right by taking their time and staying out of the fray to an extent, Geoff has chosen to jump at any chance to make his grievances clear - the album title and cover, the subject matters of the songs betraying his feelings.  In this case, coming first was not a good thing...I have a feeling that the eagerly anticipated June release might be game, set and match.\n\nTo conclude, this album suffers from inconsistency in it's approach and a further decline into a style of writing that is moving further away from fan expectation and is only succeeding in alienating people.  The PR disaster that surrounds this (free CD anyone?!) is just farcical and won't be doing 'Camp Tate' any favours.  Roll on November when I hope that the judge will see sense and put an end to this in the only logical way.  After all, if I got sacked from my company and decided to set up my own company with the same name and sell products under the same name, not to mention stealing all their web assets, I'd be arrested!  Geoff got a record deal?!  Where's the logic in that!\n\nAnyway, for those that have read the whole review, thank you for bearing with me.  These are my own opinions and I was not led astray by anyone else or coerced by the BDR faithful into writing this.\n\nThank you for your attention.";The Geoff Tate patented scale of brand depreciation...
146;64.0;3.0;30.0;"First of all, yes, I own this album, and, yes, I've listened to it several times before writing this review. When I bought it, I walked into my local record store and the cashier looked at it and gave me a sad look and I gave him a ""What are you gonna do?"" shrug. I think he understood.  He sees a lot of 40 something burn-outs chasing the dragon, at least I think he does. Then I walked out to my car with my head down and took off the plastic wrap. I say ""took"" because I did it slowly and a little sadly, I did not tear it off. I haven't torn the plastic wrap off a Queensryche CD since Hear in the Now Frontier, and then only because I mistakenly thought it would be good. No, I felt some shame as I slowly took off the wrapper and prepared to put the CD in, thinking, ""Why are you doing this to yourself man?""  The first track, Cold, came on, and it was kinda good and, surprisingly, there were a few other good tracks peppered on the disc. More on that later.\n\nI'm guessing I will get some criticism for writing what is, essentially, a mediocre review for Frequency Unknown, the latest offering from ""Queensryche"" (quotations intentional). The album is getting pretty well trashed, barring a few five star shill reviews. I'm going to make an effort to review the album in comparison to other Queensryche output without biasing it too much with the absolute BS which has gone on with the band the past year. As a longtime fan, I was predisposed to hate this record based solely on what I perceive as childish behavior on the part of Geoff Tate, as well as the fact he has run QR into the dirt for over a decade.\n\nI've been a QR fan since Mindcrime was released in 1988.  I've since seen them in concert about five times, the last time on the Mindcrime II tour. I own all the albums, the DVDs, and even the awful video game.  My favorite albums are, in order, Mindcrime, Promised Land, Empire, and Rage for Order. Queensryche started to change around the time of Promised Land in '94.  I absolutely love that album, but I think this is the point where Geoff Tate really started to take control of the reins of the band. It was also the beginning of their commercial decline. Hear In The Now Frontier was not a good album, mostly, in my opinion, because of Tate's continued experimentation with the band's sound. Then Chris DeGarmo left the band and, really, that was it.\n\nQueensryche started having problems before DeGarmo left, but they seriously started to suck afterward. Look at the track record, Q2K (horrible), Tribe (god awful), Mindcrime II (modest improvement), Take Cover (seriously?), and American Soldier (about on par with Mindcrime II). Then we get the Cabaret tour. Are you kidding me?  This was an all-time low. I honestly can't think of any artist who I really liked making me so embarrassed to be a fan. Ever. Then the last release before the band broke up, Dedicated to Chaos. I trashed that album in a review upon its release and continue to say it is the worst thing QR ever did, by a long way.\n\nSo, read that last paragraph and tell me you are surprised this band imploded. Yup, they fell apart and now there is a big fight over who is the ""real"" Queensryche. Given their track record over the past decade, I'd equate it to a pack of dogs fighting over a bloated, maggot infested corpse. Best for everybody to simply walk away and leave the thing to rot in the sun. But they haven't, so now there is Tate's Queensryche and whatever the other guys who used to be in the band decide to call their band, probably Queensryche.\n\nBut let's face it, can anyone seriously make the argument that the group who released Dedicated to Chaos wasn't already Tate's Queensryche? Michael Wilton was damn near trashing the thing before it was even released. The band never even got together to record it, just mailed their bits in and mashed it together in some kind of Frankenstein's monster of an album. There are a lot of people talking about hearing the ""real QR"" when the rest of the band releases an album in July.  I'd say, if you want to hear the ""real QR,"" go out and pick yourself up a copy of Rage for Order or Operation Mindcrime, 'cause the ""real QR"" disappeared in oh, I don't know, 1998?\n\nNow we have Frequency Unknown by ""Queensryche"" and, honestly, it is substantially better than Dedicated to Chaos. Yeah, I don't like the clear FU that Tate is making to the guys he spent 30 years with and, yeah, I don't like that it was rushed out simply to beat them to the punch. But some of the music IS better than most of the stuff QR has put out for the past ten years.  Cold, Life Without You, Fallen, and The Weight of the World are actually pretty good.  The rest are mediocre and some, Slave for example, just suck. The production is subpar and the drums, in particular, sound flat. I am unhappy that more time wasn't taken to clean up the sound.\n\nAs far as the 2013 revisions of the old hits, about all I can say is that they aren't as good as the originals, some significantly so. They don't make my eardrums bleed, as they apparently have done to some other reviewers.  I'm a little shocked to see some folks who are clearly devoted fans writing well thought out reviews ""challenging"" people to compare these to the originals. Seriously? Was anyone expecting 54 year old Geoff Tate with his busted pipes and a bunch of hired guns to improve on these songs? Have you seen this guy live in, oh, the past 10 years? For that matter, is ANYONE, going to improve on I Don't Believe in Love, Empire, or Jet City Woman? I guess they could've left them off the album and, given the reviews they probably should have; however, I'm not sickened by them as most people seem to be.\n\nAs a longtime fan, I'm sorry to see what has happened to the band this past year. I would have liked to see them pull together and put out another album on par with Mindcrime or Promised Land, but I gave up on that idea years ago. I guess I'd rather see the animosity spark some creativity and get FU and the new album in July then get another Dedicated to Chaos or Cabaret tour.  I'd say, if you have stuck around with QR this long and you can put aside your hatred of Geoff Tate, you'll probably find a few tracks on this album you will like.  Is it worth 10 bucks or the shame of looking the cashier in the eye when you lay it on the counter? It depends on how big a fan you are.";All Things Considered...
174;65.0;1.0;30.0;I really tried to give Geoff the benefit of the doubt, but I'm sorry, this album is horrible.  I've listened to it 10 times today, trying to like it.  I was even excited about the re-recordings, but sadly, his voice is going.  Jet City Woman was horribly remade.  Several times in the song, he goes off key and it made me shudder, like listening to a bad karaoke singer.  I'm very sad to hear this.  The songs sound like a hate letter to the rest of the original band that has their album coming out soon.  Even the rings on the fist on the album cover say it all.  I'm sure he wanted to use the other word instead of Frequency.  In fact, this sounded like it was thrown together to get it on the shelf to spite them.  We all know the back story of what's happened, we all know that these kind of things happen in the music world, but this whole story just makes me sad.  I'll still always admire the old Queensryche and probably like the new singer as well, but not this release.  I'd even qualify this as worse than Q2K.\n\nOn last note about the remake of Silent Lucidity, it sounds like Katherine Hepburn singing it.\n\nBuy it if you want folks, but I can't listen to it anymore.;It's a sad day indeed.
200;66.0;1.0;30.0;I have been a fan  for over 25 years and this is not DESERVING of the name Queensryche . It has one former member and is a big disappointment from start to finish . It is nothing more then another Geoff Tate solo album. The songs go no where and it is real hard to wrap my head around how can you call it Queensryche when there are 14 musicians that all have such different styles. Usually when I preview an album a song or two will stick I did not even get that with this at all. And to take 4 amazing songs and butcher them is just pathetic and the biggest disappointment about this album. I would not waste my money on this and will be waiting for June 11th when the real Queensryche will be releasing there new cd .;Queensryche Frequency Unknown-this is not Queensryche
156;67.0;2.0;29.0;"People are going to love this album...and people are going to hate it. Trust none of them. Including me. If Queensryche ever challenged us to think for ourselves then Frequency Unknown, more so than any other release in the history of the band, is the most blatant embodiment of that challenge. It has already proven to be extremely polarizing. I fear, however, that this polarization has resulted more from the drama surrounding the band than the music on display. My advice: listen to the record. Forget the context in which it exists. Chances are, you may find yourself wedged between the factions rather than firmly planted on either side. Then again, maybe not.\n\nFrequency Unknown is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But, it's not the complete disaster some of the harbingers have predicted either. Musically, its very much akin to Operation: Mindcrime 2 and American Soldier. It's not the lovechild of Dedicated To Chaos and Kings And Thieves you may have expected. That being the case, and if not for the unfortunate events over the past year, we might very well have championed this album as a return to form had the original band released it. There's only one problem. Frequency Unknown is not a Queensyche album.\n\nFrequency Unknown finds Geoff Tate as the lone remaining member of Queensryche's classic lineup. He is joined here by a veritable army of notable talent including Kelly Gray (Queensryche 1998-2000), Robert Sarzo (Quiet Riot, Hurricane), Rudy Sarzo (Ozzy Osbourne, Dio, Whitesnake, Quiet Riot), Simon Wright (AC/DC, Dio, Rhino Bucket), Randy Gane, Craig Locicero (Forbidden), Jason Slater, Martin Irigoyen, Paul Bostaph (Slayer, Testament, Exodus), Evan Bautista, Chris Cannella, Ty Tabor (King's X), K.K. Downing (Judas Priest), Brad Gillis (Night Ranger), Dave Meniketti (Y/T), and Chris Poland (Megadeth). An impressive group of musicians, no doubt. But as one would surmise...a group unable to replicate anything approximating the Queensryche sound.\n\nHaving spent some additional time with first single and lead-off track, Cold, I'm going to update my original assessment of it. My view hasn't changed much. Only now, having heard the entire album, it's abundantly clear why this was picked as the teaser. It is arguably the most commercial and accessible track on offer here. Previously, I slammed the production on this, but having lived with the entire record for a few days I can honestly say this sounds the most ""finished"" of all the tracks. It also reminds me of Open, the first single from Tribe. Both songs utilize a deceptively old-school metal riff to hook the listener. Both albums then rarely, if ever, provide a riff as memorable again throughout their duration. Still, I've warmed to this considerably. My original rating was a 6 but I'm tempted to bump that to a 7. My only issue is that it seems to overstay its welcome a bit. I would have trimmed off the last 40 seconds, cut back into the main riff, and closed it out. I feel those last 40 seconds not only kill the momentum but they also begin to expose Geoff's diminishing vocal prowess which up until this point wasn't as noticeable. One more issue: the solo doesn't fit...but, I like it anyway. Go figure.\n\nI can't understand why Dare was front-loaded on this album. At track two it has the dubious distinction of being the single worst song on the record. Already, the flow is botched. To begin with, the sonic shift from the opening salvo to Dare is jarring. It's obvious these songs were mixed by different people. That isn't something you want made obvious. Musically, this is dated and dull. The riff is browned out and boring. The lyrics are embarrassing. Geoff's tough guy attitude and use of the F-bomb do him absolutely no favors here. Let's talk about the hook: there isn't one. It goes nowhere. This is a stale leftover from Dedicated To Chaos...and nobody wants those leftovers.\n\nGive It To You is next. I was relieved to discover this had no musical or lyrical similarity to Got It Bad despite my intuition telling me it would. Instead, this is a laid back modern rocker and a very different sound for Geoff. Again, odd placement on the record. However, I actually enjoy the main lick quite a bit. There's a distinct southern rock vibe to it. It reminds me of something on Tesla's last two studio albums. Robert Sarzo's solo on this is also a nice surprise. It's just unfortunate that Give It To You wasn't an instrumental piece because the lyrics and vocals ruin the entire thing.\n\nThankfully, things pick up with Slave. I was expecting to hate this track based on the 30-second sample but it has become one of the few that I feel actually works both musically and vocally. Firstly, it's in possession of a monster groove and Geoff sounds good over it. His sinister, whispered vocal on the verses is effective even if he begins to strain again during the chorus. While I think the track loses steam during the break down segment, I find it quite solid overall. My only major gripe...the awkward fade out. What happened there?\n\nIn The Hands Of God is my favorite track. This could have appeared on Operation: Mindcrime 2 or American Soldier. I wouldn't be surprised if it was originally written for either of those. This is dark, moody, and experimental. It's filled with those trademark Tate spoken-word passages you either love or think have become a crutch. There's definitely a nod to Gonna Get Close To You going on here as well. The most progressive oriented song on the album and the closest to the classic Queensryche sound.\n\nWhen Running Backwards kicked in I was beginning to think the album had hit its stride. I legitimately dig the opening riff...but once again, the vocals and lyrics make it virtually unlistenable. Tate's tendency to scat his words here just ruins any impact the music may have had. As before, no hook to speak of. Just the title repeated over and over with no emotion behind it. Rushed and pointless.\nLife Without You is a leftover from Operation: Mindcrime 2. I have no concrete evidence to back this up but I am convinced of it. Listen to this and imagine Nikki singing this to the now deceased Sister Mary. The music during the verses attempts that moody motif from Mindcrime. There's even a line about revolution. Regardless, this is second only to Cold as the most commercially viable track on the album. I'm assuming ""second single"" but my better judgement tells me I'm fooling myself.\nEverything is yet another interesting musical idea marred by a sleepy vocal and inane lyrics. This track demands an intense, powerful delivery but what we get is one of Tate's most emotionless performances so far. He just sounds so bored by the whole mess. He clearly has no interest in this music at all. There's a nice little Queen-esque break at the two-minute mark but Geoff sings over it so, nevermind.\n\nFallen. See Everything above, but add ""faceless modern garbage"" to the description.\n\nWeight Of The World creeps in with Geoff's increasingly shaky vocals over acoustic guitar. Nowhere is it more apparent just how far his instrument has deteriorated than it is here. Where once he was powerful, clear, and smooth...now he's strained, nasally, and raspy. This is the album's closing piece and is clearly modeled after epics like Anybody Listening? and Someone Else? and The Right Side Of My Mind. It comes nowhere near the majestic power displayed on those classics. Those songs were sweeping, emotional, and beautiful. Weight Of The World is none of those things. It quickly devolves from such lofty aspirations into a brash conglomeration of under produced and poorly mixed nonsense. It's a six minute song. It seems like ten.\n\nIn regards to the four re-recorded classics that close the album: Listen to each of them one time to satiate your curiosity. Then, delete them. There's no reason to listen to these bastardizations ever again. There's no reason they should even exist. The re-recorded tracks are the biggest abomination imaginable and are an absolute disgrace to the originals. I am absolutely shocked Tate allowed these to ever see the light of day. Anyone with any respect for the legacy of the band would have never participated in the creation of these travesties. Moving on...\n\nFrequency Unknown could have very easily been the best Geoff Tate solo album ever released. If Tate had started this project last summer, hired a competent producer, engineer, and mixer, fleshed out the lyrics, and dedicated some time with a respected vocal coach...the results would have surprised everyone. That may seem like a lot of work. It really isn't. All of those things could have been achieved within the past year. Instead, the album was rushed. Don't believe me? Listen to it. The proof is right there in the production, in the mix, in the vocals, in the lyrics, and in the songs. Again, there is much here I enjoy. Geoff Tate has always been eclectic in his musical tastes and influences. There are interesting musical ideas scattered all over this. However, the pieces are constructed with a careless, show-me-the-money attitude. That attitude translates directly to the finished project. You can hear it. Any commerical and/or critical potential this could have had has been suffocated by the desire to speed this product onto the shelves for a quick buck. Talk about irony.\n\nMaybe Geoff's next project should be a concept album based around the story of the Tortoise and the Hare.\n\n4.5/10";QUEENSRYCHE - FREQUENCY UNKNOWN
187;68.0;2.0;29.0;i am giving this Album review 2 stars and i think i am being very generous in doing that, Because it really only deserves 1.\n\ni have got to be honest. This is one of the most boring and contrived albums i have heard in quite some time.\n\ni thought that Dedicated to Chaos was bad, But this is even worse. This album is chocked full of cliche's and recycled riffs that have been beaten into the ground for the last 20 years now. Geoff Tate sounds like he recorded the vocals from his bathroom, And most of the music on here sounds like 90's Grunge.\n\ni really regret buying this album. it lacks Creativity or Imagination. it has absolutely no redeeming virtue whatsoever. Some bands just don't know when to quit, And Queensryche is clearly one of them.\n\ni really can't reccomend buying this album at all. i have listened to this CD over and over and i can't find any Nievete's or Nuance's in the music to reccomend it. Avoid this one.;Rust in Peace
121;69.0;1.0;28.0;"I've followed Queensryche ""story so far"" as a more or less neutral fan of the band who's enjoyed nearly everything they've put out.  I never got to see the ""classic"" lineup live (first catching them on the Q2K tour) and found them to be a good, sometimes great live act regardless.  I've also professed to being annoyed with the conduct of many so-called Queensryche fans, both online and at the shows i've been to, who a) can't get over the loss of DeGarmo, b) keep slagging everything the band does after DeGarmo, and c) what do you think DeGarmo is doing now why hasn't DeGarmo returned what do you think DeGarmo would think about this etc, etc.  So despite the ominous portents of a thoroughly bad Geoff Tate solo album and completely obvious cover art that shows the maturity of a ten-year-old, I was prepared to ignore the loud Internet fan forum predictions for this album.  I wanted to believe that the songwriting team that was behind _O:M II_ (an album which I enjoyed), in tandem with a bunch of musicians I really like (including Dave Meniketti, Ty Tabor and half of thrash titans Forbidden) would still figure out how to put out something worthwhile.  Well, I gotta say the crow is tasting pretty bitter today, because instead of even something workmanlike, Tate and co. have churned out a crass, ignoble cash-in of a record, one superficially more heavy but on par with more lackluster efforts like _American Soldier_ and _Dedicated To Chaos_.\n\nWith the lively enough first single ""Cold,"" the straightforward ""Dare"" and ""In The Hands of God"" being decent enough tunes - the latter benefitting in part from some interesting textures and Ty Tabor's sympathetic soloing - things start out promisingly enough.  But much of this, as has been written elsewhere is repetitive bitter riff-rock like ""Slave,""  likeable enough at the chorus but otherwise unremarkable dirges like ""Life Without You"", the dull Linkin Park/Static-X electro-trickery behind ""Everything,"" or mid tempo chugga-chugga like ""Running Backwards"" which despite a perfectly matched solo from K.K. Downing, just doesn't seem right being called Queensryche.  Coupled with the flat production, it feels rushed and incomplete.\n\nNow, the respectable path *could* have been to take the entirety of _Kings and Thieves_ along with the first ten songs here, put them together and cull some of the weaker numbers, consolidate it into one halfway decent album more true to the songwriting space Tate has been in, and release it as a Geoff Tate solo record.  Tour with the new lineup, hell even celebrate O:M on the placards.  Put your bad attitude into the music and let it fuel the performances on the road, and figure out the legal wrangling behind the scenes, where it would not cause further ill will towards the man and his career.  At least that's what i'd figure anyone with any modicum of sense in the Tate camp might have advised him to do, whatever bad feelings there are amongst all the players.\n\nBut we the fans have to deal with _F.U._ being released as a Queensryche record.  Thus we arrive with a crash to the four-song cash in at the end of the record.  Even in and of itself the first ten songs of _F.U._would not merit such a low rating, but with the inclusion of what can only be described as the sonic evisceration of four classic Queensryche songs as ""bonus"" tracks, _F.U._ becomes a wholly offensive assault on the senses.  These depressing renditions of ""I Don't Believe In Love,"" ""Empire,"" ""Jet City Woman,"" and ""Silent Lucidity"" are fully deserving of the wrath of even the most repetitive DeGarmo-obsessed 'spergin internet forum guy.  They are clueless, tuneless, dispirited performances, featuring badly out of key, passionless vocals from Tate, with merely competent tightar$ed backing musicianship, and flat paper-thin demo-quality production.  They do not differ from the original songs with the intent of showing some artistic re-interpretation.  They differ because the session musician (Martin Irigoyen) learned the cliff-note version of the songs quickly and Tate was so desperate to add them to the album to increase his publishing take, it seems he didn't even have time to warm up his voice.  These are not valid versions of these songs, these are drunk karaoke-level insults that will provide Lou Reed/Metallica ""Lulu"" level hilarity for years to come for those fans courageous enough to make it through them.  ""Empire,"" with its ham-fisted, over-earnest attempt to duplicate the original intro of the song, and especially ""Silent Lucidity"" which shows the apparent frailty of Tate's vocals, are the most embarassing and egregious.  Without these four awful renditions, this is a 2-1/2 star, maybe 3-star album on a good day.  With them, well, Amazon won't let me give negative ratings, so one-star will have to do.\n\nAdd it all up in a single package,  and you get what we can only hope is the nadir of this sad tale - but then there's the OTHER QR album coming in June and the possibility of both bands touring and competing this summer, and I think the bad vibes have only just begun.  At least in this chapter, it really feels like Tate is trying to damage the brand, which seems suicidal, immature and ludicrous, but with the pap all over this plate what else are we supposed to believe at the end of the day?  The cover art isn't aimed at the ex-bandmates, it's aimed straight at the fans, and that's a very sad sad thing.";Abysmal, uninspired, spiteful cash-in
198;70.0;1.0;28.0;This is a fraud. Geoff Tate has abandoned the other guys in Queensryche and tried to lay claim to the name. If it were anything approaching a great Queensryche album, we could understand, but this is junk. I say that as a Queensryche fan literally since 1983. Wait for the real Queensryche to emerge in June.;Very simply: a fraud
134;71.0;2.0;27.0;"I don't really care about the internal Queensryche struggles, or the rabid fanbois who choose one side or the other and disparage out of hand the side with whom they don't agree. The (former) band mates need to address their issues amongst themselves ... well, in court ... and no raging fan is going to change my mind when it comes to what I like in music.\n\nWith that said, I do care about the music.\n\nWith the exception of a couple of individual tracks here and there, I have been disgusted by every Queensryche release after Promised Land.  It got to the point that (until F.U.) I haven't bought an album since Tribe, and I don't go to QR concerts or buy QR memorabilia anymore.\n\nYes, Geoff is older now, and one has to be realistic in that you can't expect him to sound like he did on The Warning almost 30 years later.  With that said, I find it odd that the 'other' Queensryche's singer (Todd La Torre), actually captures Geoff's former voice better than Geoff himself.\n\nPeople say that F.U. doesn't sound like Queensryche, but I beg to differ.  I think it sounds just like the garbage they have been putting out since the Ear album.  Okay, so I don't have an ear for the intricacies of music theory, but I do know what my ears like and that is what I will pay for and listen to.  After listening to Geoff tate's F.U., the released track of the 'other' Queensryche, and seeing their videos of their live performances, I can now comfortably blame Geoff Tate for the crap they have been spewing since the last 90's.  True or not, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\nSo, here you go Geoff.  You got my F.U. album money.  Just don't take it as consent to put out more garbage like this.  Actually, I don't care; this is the last dime you'll ever get from me - (unless I feel the need to re-purchase Warning, Rage, Mindcrime, or Promised Land).  I only bought this album because one day either you or the other guys are going to lose the Queensryche name, and I'll have a collectors item.  It won't be worth spit, and no one will want to suffer through listening to it, but I'll have it.\n\nIn the last couple of years my two favorite bands - Queensryche and Kamelot - have lost their singers.  I never thought either of those two singers could be properly replaced, but, from what I have heard so far, Kamelot made a good choice and the 'other' Queensryche blew me away.\n\nI wish you well Geoff ... sincerely.  You still have a fan base and people who like this kind of music-ish stuff.  May you always make them proud!  As for me, I'm going with the other guys.";It's about the music not the drama.
162;72.0;2.0;27.0;"All the fun on Blabbermouth aside, both versions of Queensryche had a chance to blow fans away. The live video clips of the Todd-fronted version are pretty great, and as a 46 year old who bought the EP when it actually came out I'm psyched to see them live and hear the album. The Geoff years of late have blown hard, and though this is absolutely an improvement over Dedicated To Chaos, it's pretty lame. I like some of the arrangements a lot, but most of the performances sound very uninspired; Geoff especially. His voice is a shell of its' past, but the mix and songwriting is dismal. This is really more of a Jason Slater album than Geoff or Queensryche, and it really sounds like a hodge podge of karaoke tracks thrown together to make real songs. It's a far cry from the Queensryche I love, but I did buy it so I had hope. The remakes are disasters that sound like they were recorded in an empty gym, and the rumors of Geoff sampling original vocal tracks from past albums is true; though not every line of every song. He actually sounds so bad on some that I can't believe they were released. Cleopatra records is offering to send buyers of this version a re-mixed one for free if you email them a pic of your receipt. Maybe that will help.";What I expected based on the samples
163;73.0;2.0;27.0;"Though there are some interesting and engaging ideas here and there on this album...overall it just sounds flat and uninspired...and definitely nothing like the Queensryche sound (in it's many variations) we all know and love. Pretty standard fare here. Miles away from progressive. The mix could be much better also...from what I hear this album was quite rushed in it's conception and execution....so not so suprised by the end result. Seriously...this is a Geoff Tate solo effort. Though I'm not a huge fan of the ""let's mimic the old singer to the point of being ridiculous"" approach Todd L. from the other version of Queensryche is taking, at least the music being created there is closer to what we all recognize as vintage Ryche...a bit more ambitious and less formulaic than Frequency Unknown.";Frequency: Uninteresting
170;74.0;2.0;27.0;You guys are killing me...lol....I have never seen so many reviews the very first day of a release.  I haven't even heard it yet but I can already agree with you....sorry Mr. Tate...you had this coming....;OMG...
195;75.0;2.0;27.0;"Honestly, I was hoping both version of Queensryche would/will put out quality albums.  A win/win for everyone.  Not going to happen now.\n\nLet's call it wot(hahaha)it is.... a Tate solo album with guests.  A hodge-podge of people that shouldn't play together... writers(Jason Slater and Tate) have a track record of writing uninteresting, garbage albums...  I give this 2.5 stars as it is ""better"" than Dedicated but has no replay value.  This was just a rushed attempt to get an album out before the other Queensryche releases their album in June.  Stupid lyrics I'm sure Tate thinks are clever.  They are not!!!!\n\nThis album was made is 6 weeks, which is doable for bands that have talent.  He has some ""quality"" guys here but I think Geoff's ego would not allow for others to help him out (other than Slater).  Just a sloppy mess of ideas not fully developed and paid musicians (think employees not band members)that will play what is placed before them without any attachment.  As someone that plays guitar myself, I have no desire to learn and play along with what is presented here.  I still play along with the ""classic"" stuff from time to time.\n\nI'm sure there are a few that think Geoff can do no wrong and he can release an album of flatulence and belches.  They would still write the glowing 5 star review.  Let's be honest...Geoff Tate hasn't sounded great for at least a decade.  His band sounds unrehearsed and jarring in places.  If this was a demo of jams or a scratch pad of ideas then I could accept that someday something might come of it.  Not a full release and ""remix to fix"" and release again.\n\nI'm glad Queensryche kicked Tate out.  Now they can move on with out him dragging them through the mud.\n\nSide note:  I saw a site that listed Tate's net worth at $17 million.  I wonder how much of this tour and album and band salary he is funding out of his pocket?  I'm sure 100% because anyone would be stupid to toss a dime at this guy.\n\nDo I think this is a 1 star album? Not really. Just done very poorly and not my style.  I think most people are polarized by Geoff's actions.  I've like bands where I don't like a member before but Geoff's ego isn't doing him any favors.\n\nAs a fan of Queensryche, this is sad.... but there still is hope in the other version's release... Maybe?!!!";This is not my Queensryche!
196;76.0;1.0;27.0;I tried to come up with a clever critique of this CD and I think I was able to sum up my criticism quite nicely with two words.....THIS BLOWS!;This is NOT Queensryche
118;77.0;1.0;26.0;I won't go into the politics behind this record. I won't dwell on the fact that Geoff Tate has been dragging the Queensryche name through the mud for years, but I will point out that not only is Frequency Unknown a continuation of that tradition, it exceeds all previous efforts by a mile in tarnishing their once-great reputation.\n\nFrequency Unknown is a disaster. From the lousy songwriting and bored performances to the piss-poor production and cover art, the record is an uninspired and contrived piece of garbage not even worthy of the plastic that holds the cd. It lacks any semblance of musical or creative ability, and displays a huge error of judgement on the part of everyone involved from Geoff Tate and the hired guns he passes off for Queensryche, to the record execs too blinded by their own greed to see how big of a mistake releasing this album was.\n\nThey rushed through this album in order to give Geoff Tate leverage in court over his former bandmates. they knew that by releasing their album first they would sell more copies, giving Tate a reason to retain rights to the name. This is a shrewd business tactic that resulted an album that sounds thrown together. The production of this album is absolutely horrendous, with the mixing in particular being one of the worst in the history of recorded sound. There are points in the album where the guitars are so loud and distorted it becomes impossible to listen to. Your ears get bombarded with an undecipherable wall of sound intermittedly throughout almost every song. They could have fixed this issue, but they had to rush the album out as quickly as possible. Why would I care to listen to something when the people who made it didn't care about it themselves?\n\nThe songs themselves sound cut-and-pasted together. They are structured around Tate's vocal performance, which is unfortunate considering he gives the worst performance on the album. He has absolutely no musical range and lacks any trace of emotion or conviction in his voice. They tried to make up for this fact by piling every effect in the pro tools repertoire onto his vocal track, but in the end it comes out sounding more lifeless than ever. If you still aren't convinced Geoff Tate lost his soul, look no further than the song Weight of the World where Tate sounds like he's singing through the drive-thru microphone at McDonalds. I didn't know if it was Geoff Tate singing or if it was my computer asking me to put it out of its misery. And If you have any faith in Tate as a lyricist, or if you want to have yourself a good laugh, listen to the song Dare.\n\nGeoff Tate deserves most of the blame for this turd of an album, but the musicians attached to it didn't help matters whatsoever. Simon Wright was a horrible choice for a drummer. He plays a more straight-forward, rock n' roll style which he displayed in AC/DC, but that playing style does not fit at ALL with Queensryche, who have traditionally leaned more progressively. Scott Rockenfeld was a great drummer who constantly kept things interesting with his innovative playing, but Wright simply plays the same beat throughout the entire song regardless of what the guitarists are doing (not that they are doing much anyway). This makes for a very disjointed and confusing listening experience that suggests they didn't take enough time to rehearse as a band before going into the studio.\n\nIn terms of song structure, this offers absolutely no variety or innovation. A lot of the songs sound like b-sides to Dedicated to Chaos, while the rest sound like a rip off of Jet City Woman. They didn't care about writing good songs for this crap. Don't get me started on the re-recordings, they are just depressing to listen to.\n\nCleopatra records should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this train wreck. It is an unfinished product. The songs are not mixed properly whatsoever. You'd think they would have some standards of quality, but apparently not considering they released the album even though they knew it wasn't mixed correctly. They knew that fans would be ripped off, which is why they are now offering replacement copies for any fans dissatisfied with the sound. How about getting it right the first time?\n\nIn this day and age this behavior from a record company is abhorrent. it is exactly the reason why the record industry is dying, because of the irresponsible people at companies like Cleopatra records who have no problem shoveling this horrible product out to the buying audience. Disgusting.;An Embarrassment for All Parties
126;78.0;1.0;26.0;I tried to like this album but I couldn't. It just sounds like every other Tate solo album and later Queensryche albums. He shouldn't have done a rush job just to get something out before the real Queensryche released their music. I thought this might have promise with all the guest musicians but it didn't help whatsoever. The worst part of it are the remakes, he really destroyed some classics. Save your money and buy the real Queensryche in June.;Wow Geoff Wow
131;79.0;1.0;26.0;The original music is passable in parts, even enjoyable in moments. If you are a Tate fan and liked Kings and Thieves, its probably worth your money. But its not Queensryche.\n\nWhat is Queensryche are the last four tracks, which are re-recordings of 4 classics. This is the reason FU gets a 1 star rating. The re-recordings take the only Queensryche in the album and strip them of their majesty. We're left with a sonic mess that lacks emotion, musicianship, and were purely done for the money, which Tate admits in an interview. Its a travesty.\n\nMaybe Tate needed the money, I do not know. If he did need the money at least he could have taken his time and really done at least the re-recordings right or least gave them a new orchestration... something that would set them apart and at least attempt to do justice to the originals. But nope, its just down right terrible.\n\nI do know is that the real Queensryche album comes out on June 11th. Save your pennies another couple of months.;Just don't
139;80.0;2.0;26.0;it sounds like i'm at a rehearsal studio down the hall from them and they have the door closed... SO muffled...\n\ni have such fondness for this band. i discovered them a bit late, around empire... loved promised land... actually quite like hear in the now fronteir after the initial shock of how different it was. it's really a fine album to me. but q2k is terrible, tribe is bad, mindcrime 2 was a step in the right direction, american soldier was terrible and i actually liked some of dedicated to chaos quite a bit, primarily because it SOUNDS fantastic. i'm a sucker for a well-recorded album.\n\nbut a badly produced cd i cannot tolerate even if the songwriting is good... but the songwriting isn't good, it's bland. there are a few songs that are ok but on the whole i'm pretty disappointed.\n\nqueensryche have always been a sort of 'thinking man's metal band' and i always appreciated that. so naming the record 'f.u.' is pretty childish and petty. if nothing else, this is a nail in the coffin for my opinion of geoff tate. all last year as i watched interviews with the other members i was impressed by their attitude. they seem like really good guys. when asked in interviews for dirt, they declined every time, preferring to let the music speak for itself... when i found out geoff was going to get his record out first i thought 'how the heck has he done this?' and was a bit worried. but again, the band responded in an interview that they were not worried, that they'd take their time and do it right...\n\nso if the music is going to speak for itself, and geoff spoke first, what did he say?\n\n...nothing worth mentioning...;holy cow does this cd sound terrible
142;81.0;1.0;26.0;It almost feels like a rap album with almost all songs if not all are lyrically attacking the other members of Queensryche. The sound and mixes are way below what you would expect from a Queensryche album even with their latest not so popular releases. Gotta say Geoff is on a warpath to destroy anything that was. Not the Metal or progressive album promised.;Pretty Spinnal Tappish here....
153;82.0;1.0;26.0;"I'm going to be honest here, I haven't had much to enjoy with QR music in while.  After Empire it just started on a downward slide.  I get that musicians want to try new things, but sometimes fans just want that return to form.  They want to hear something on par with Rage for Order, Operation Mindcrime, Empire.  I got into a few songs on Promised Land, enjoyed a few on Hear in the Now Frontier (granted it took several listens) and it felt like with each new release I found less and less to enjoy.  At one point I thought, ""Did DeGarmo have THAT much of an impact on the band?  I still think his departure was a big part of it.  From that point on, I found 1 song, if I was lucky, that I really enjoyed on Tribe, Mindcrime II.  After that I just gave up.  I sampled Chaos and American Soldier but realized the Queensryche I feel in love with was no more.\n\nI heard about the split, didn't dig too much into it, saw Tate on That Metal Show and was really hoping for something good from his solo effort.  Yeah...what a joke that was.  Seems like this offering is just more of the same.  I heard Cold and thought, this may have something good.  Then I kept on listening.  (What the hell is with the out of place solo?)  From there it's just a hailstorm of bad song after bad song.  I've heard that this was thrown together very quick and if it was, it shows.\n\nI'll be honest, I've listened to Redemption and I'm not a huge fan of bands that replace singers with others that sound like the original, sometimes it works, but often it just feels odd...Perhaps it'll work, and maybe not. I'll give the disc a listen and judge it more then.\n\nBut this is about F.U. to which I say...reallY?  Are we 10 Geoff and on the playground again ready to take our ball and go home because we didn't get our way? <rolls eyes>\n\nBottom line, avoid this mess and spend your hard earned money on another band/artist that actually cares about what the fans want to hear.  And the fact that Geoff and the Record Company are out in full force, supposedly, posting 5 star reviews shows just how little they care about the fans.  For those folks that do like it, good for you.  Different strokes for different folks.  But if you were looking for a return to form, it's not here.";Not even worth 1 star
159;83.0;2.0;26.0;"Okay, I came into this with an open mind.  I was excited to hear new music from Geoff Tate, but let me get this across right now since I've had my first listen; in my opinion, this is not Queensryche.\n\nI thought Cold was pretty good, but tracks 2-4... I honestly can't imagine myself ever listening to those again.  The rest of the songs are decent, with some nice moments, reflections from the past I guess, and were even a little Q-Ryche sounding at parts.  Quietryoche isn't such a bad band.  Life Without You is my favorite here.  It sounded the most like what I had hoped for.  In the Hands of God, Fallen, and The Weight of the World were pretty good too.  I enjoyed those.\n\nI was set on giving this album a solid 3.49 stars (3 rounded down) for giving me 4 good songs, but then...\n\nThe worst thing about this album is the rehashed Queensryche songs at the end (2013 version).  Seriously, I've heard tribute bands that were better than this.  I Don't Believe in Love's new chorus did not sit right with me.  Empire was alright until the badly out of tune guitars at the end, but the part that made me burst out laughing was the chorus on Jet City Woman.  My God!  Really?  Is this on purpose?  I know the other Ryche has gotten crap for using autotune on their released song, but this version of Jet City Woman is a perfect example of where it was desperately needed.  Maybe the guys felt they could perform these in their sleep?  Maybe they were in a hurry, or just lazy, or wanted it ""raw""?  I don't know, but it doesn't sound good.  I turned it off before silent Lucidity.  I hate dictating (no pun intended) how any one band should sound, but I just expect you to be TUNED UP, and SINGING IN TUNE on your STUDIO album.\n\nProduction wise, this album is very inconsistent.  You can tell that guest musicians were coming in and out, and there is no focus production wise.  It's clear the goal of this was to get it down and released as quick as possible.\n\nI'll continue to support, but it's hard to give props to an album that is sooo...  yeah.";Jet City WoOoOomAaAaAn... F-ME
109;84.0;1.0;25.0;"Sometimes you just feel a certain way about things and you know them to be true and it doesn't matter what goes on around it..it doesn't change that reality.  That is where I am with Geoff Tate.\n\nI will start this way.  I bought the Queensryche EP the week it was first released on vinyl and have either owned or heard every single recording by Queensryche since.  And up until ""Promised Land"", I was a MASSIVE fan...obsessive in fact.  I LOVED and still love those early recordings and Geoff will always be one of my all-time favorite singers...HOWEVER...that was then..this is now.\n\nI can't support anything Mr. Tate does moving forward because I just can't look past his childish, immature and completely unprofessional manner in which he is conducting himself in the wake of being booted out of Queensryche.  The album cover alone is so distasteful and rude. His lashing out at fans..(he is now challenging us to show our faces and ""rant"" on Youtube as to why we hate the new recording. What is that???  Who does stuff like that??  It's grade school nonsense and so beneath what was once an amazing and influential artist.\n\nTate and his manager rushed this to ""beat"" Queensryche to the punch and get their title out first..but in doing so..presented a wildly sub par effort, that lacks anything remotely entertaining , melodic or creative.  And come on..it sounds horrible!  This is nothing more then a manufactured attempt at a new ""Super Group""..which we all know..ALWAYS fail..and why..?? Because you can't force feed chemistry..and that is what is solely lacking from this album. It has no soul or heart.\n\nFrom this point forward...he could release the second coming of ""Rage For Order"" and I wouldn't touch it...because I am not giving one penny of my money..or one more second of my time to ANYTHING he does.";Don't confuse the past with the present...I can't forgive the present.
128;85.0;1.0;25.0;"I am not here to attack the business decisions of Queensryche or Geoff Tate, I'm to review this record, which I did indeed purchase.\n\nAnd let me tell you; it's bad. Cold, the single, is one of the most generic pieces of music I've ever purchased. No surprise that a guy from Rockstar Supernova had a hand in writing it, it's a generic radio rock song that would fit much better on an album by Staind or Blue October. You can also really tell that album was thrown together in a hurry; the guitar solo is COMPLETELY out of place and doesn't fit with the rest of the song at all. It's obvious someone was sent a tape and told to lay something down as quickly as possible.\n\nGeoff Tate's voice sounds fine on here, despite the obvious hints of autotune that plague most modern rock, but the songwriting and artistic direction is simply not there. This is a random batch of radio-friendly rock songs that all follow the same structure; Queensryche output has been inconsistent at best the past decade, but they've never been reduced to writings ""hit songs"" in a format that has nothing in common with their usual style.\n\nThe best thing about this album are the re recordings of the songs that are 20 years old, and they don't even feature the new members of the band.\n\nDo not buy this record. I know the cover is cool, but the music within makes ""American Solider"" look like ""Operation Mindcrime""";Really Bad, Guys. Really Bad.
135;86.0;1.0;25.0;This album has absolutely no involvement of the band Queensryche. Geoff Tate has been fired from Queensryche for spitting on a band mate, threatening another one and making sure he had his family involved with all aspects of band merchandising and promotion. He is manipulative and cowardly. The majority of Queensryche fans have turned on him and now he must give out free tickets at casinos just to have 100 people in the audience. Do NOT support this individual. I've said it once and I'll say it again. This guy was once a SPECTACULAR singer. Now he doesn't even have a voice.;NOT an actual Queensryche album. FRAUDULENT!
137;87.0;1.0;25.0;"It all started with Dedicated to Chaos, who would have known that the title would be a symbolism to how Tate has steadied himself the last 4 years. His wrecking his own legacy by releasing poor efforts and being a pitiful fool. This album is not a Queen album, it is by far their worst.\n\nTate does not even sound like he did in Q2K, very underrated album but it was possibly the last time he sounded good. He is becoming increasingly annoying and this ""band"" is an atrocity starting with Kelly Gray.\n\nTate becomes naive to the point that he just can't quit. I sure am on him. It is sad being disgusted by one of my favorite singers but now he's knocked off the list with his releases.";Tate keeps dragging down his own legacy
147;88.0;1.0;25.0;Here's an honest, unbiased review from a longtime admirer of QR and Tate's vocals - this album is terrible.\n\nFirstly, the sound doesn't even resemble QR. Secondly, all that talent Tate hired to record on the album makes no difference because they didn't write the songs, Tate did with that terrible producer. Thirdly and most importantly, Tate's vocals are, by far, the weakest link on the record.\n\nIt sounds like a rush-job, sounds very artificial and contrived and most songs have no flow and memorability. I won't buy this record. I'll wait for the real QR to release their album in June before passing judgement on them.;Limp and disappointing
205;89.0;1.0;25.0;"I decided to check out this album whilst checking my e-mail this morning. After finding an appropriate stream of the album, I opened up trusty old AOL. Imagine my surprise and horror when instead of hearing ""You've Got Mail!"" AOL simply told me ""You've Got Vesticular Cancer!!!"" as I promptly slammed myself in the taint with a pipewrench.";Pipe? Check. AOL? Check. Cancer? Check. Taint? Ryche.
97;90.0;1.0;24.0;"Please no more music, Mr. Tate. This is just awful. The producer is partly to blame; I wouldn't have let the songs see the light of day as they are. It seems we have another singer with Axl Rose syndrome who thinks he can call himself the band when there's not a single other original member left. These members are for hires. And take a look at the personnel he brings into try and add life to this album-- it actually clutters things up. The original songs here are dry and the re-recorded versions are just disrespectful to the original versions. Why do artists even bother? They're never better the second time around. I don't expect the other Queensryche to be any better with a different singer. They really haven't been the same since Chris DeGarmo left. He was the primary songwriter ad that's exactly what this album is missing: good songs.";Hang up your boots, Tate
119;91.0;1.0;24.0;"Let me start by saying that I have been kind in the past to lead singers who have with much drama changed out their entire band (see my reviews of Evanescence's Evanescence and Guns `N Rose Chinese Democracy for the proof).  My review has nothing to do with all of the drama in how ""Queensryche"" got to the point of releasing Frequency Unknown.  It is just about the music.\n\nOh, and Frequency Unknown is a stinker of the highest order.  Geoff Tate and his new crew produced ten songs that lack any sort of unifying thought.  At times they try (emphasis on the try) to sound hard.  Both ""Cold"" and ""Slave"" see to channel Ozzy's band from 20 years ago.  Then you have ""Everything"" which sounds like Tate took a page from Axl Rose on Chinese Democracy with the addition of electronics.  I could go on, but what would be the point?  Just in these three songs you get the lack of unity, and they just aren't well done.\n\nWith what I have written so far, I would give this two stars.  I don't like it, and I wouldn't recommend it.  However, I have also heard worse.  What makes this a bottom of the barrel offering is the final four re-recorded songs from Operation Mindcrime and Empire.  I can't imagine that there is any way that Tate can listen to these and say, ""Yep.  I'm proud of that fine work.""  His vocals show the wear and tear of 20 plus years, but the instrumentals are just awful.  It is an insult to the original musicians to release these counterfeit versions.  If you are not familiar with the originals, do yourself a favor and check them out.  They are some of the great songs from that time in music.\n\nIn the end, the difference between the Queensryche reboot and those of Evanescence and Guns `N Roses is that Frequency Unknown just doesn't measure up to Queensryche's history.  It doesn't have to be the same style.  Chinese Democracy couldn't be more of a departure from Appetite for Destruction, but it is musically brilliant in its own right.  What Geoff Tate and company produced here is an atrocity to the recording industry at large.  When it is original, it is subpar.  When it revisits the past, it isn't even a faint shadow.  You can find something better to spend your money on than this.  You'd even better burning it than buying this.";Drama Aside, This Is Just Bad Music
140;92.0;1.0;24.0;"Well I woke up to get me a cold pop when I thought someone was murdering a cat.  Then I said oh lord it's the new Geoff Tate album masquerading as the new Queensryche album.  And I Ran for the door, I didn't grab no shoes no nothin' Jesus.  I ran for my life.  But then the sounds, they done got me, now I have an inner ear infection.  Ain't nobody got time for that.\n\nOk in as much seriousness as can be given to such a hilarious album, I have been a huge Queensryche fan, and Geoff Tate's vocals were a huge part of that.  But he doesn't have that vocal ability anymore.  It's ok.  A lot of singers lose it in time.  It happened to Axl Rose, Robert Plant, to name a few.  They can't all be Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson, Ronnie James Dio's.  RIP Dio man we miss you.  This becomes a huge problem when the only attraction here is the singer, this being essentially a solo album.  Let's face it the regular band is very bland and boring, lacking any real talent.\n\nNow to be fair Queensryche hasn't been worth anything since Degarmo left, though he did return and while Tribe wasn't a fantastic album it was much better than Q2k and the albums that followed.  Everything they've released since has been bland and boring.  I gave up after American soldier which was pretty bad, and only listened ot DTC out of morbid curiosity.  I'm actually glad that album came out because it finally woke everyone else up to how bad they've become.\n\nSo as others have stated buyer beware.  This is not Queensryche.  Much like Axl Rose's Chinese Democracy, or Billy Corgan's Oceana, this is a singer who's lost both his vocal ability, songwriting ability, and ability to create great melodies, trying to hold onto past glories all the while thinking they're the only reason their respective bands were annything to begin with.  So if you like the previously mentioned albums you may like this.  What we have here is Geoff Tate and his bunch of yes men with a bunch of hired hands to add some guitar solos that Kelly Gray is incapable of playing, many of whom I've enjoyed previous work in the past by.  I said something similar on my review for CD but one singer and a lineup that changes from track to track does not make a band, and the same holds true here.  So as I said I'm sure most have seen reviews or know the story of this band.  Queensryche FOUNDING MEMBERS along with another fired Geoff Tate for a number of reasons I won't get into and his response was to file a lawsuit trying to get the rights to the name of a band he wasn't even an original member of.  This not to mention him taking control of the band for over a decade running the quality into the ground with his idiotic ideas and bad vocals and horrible lyrics.  Then in order to release an album before November,, when a final court decision will be made to determine who gets the rights to the Queensryche name, to release one final album under the Queensryche name, Mr. Tate hires whoever he can and rushes to release ana lbum before it was complete.  And here we have FU.\n\nThis album is seriously rushed, both in the production which is horrible and the songwriting.  There are a few moments that seem to have a little promise, musically, but they didn't take the time to work on anythign, simply cutting some demos and calling it an album is pretty much what this is.  I'm currently listening to this on youtube as we speak, for reference, cause no way will I give this man any more money.\n\nSome thoughts on a few tracks\n\nDare LOL Geoff Tate trying to sound like a tough guy with lame and boring lyrics and horrible vocal delivery and a hilariously bad chorus.  You wouldn't dare, you wouldn't dare hurt me cause you might get hurt yourself"" lol hilarious.\n\nCold is the only not completely terrible song.  If the vocals were done by someone who could actually sing then this might have been a fairly solid track.\n\nSlave has an ok riff in part of it, but the vocals are awful and the melody makes no sense.  And don't tell me I just don't get what he's trying to do, because I do.  He's trying to cash in on the Queensryche name before he can no longer can.  That's it.\n\nRunning backwards, what's with the vocals in this one?  Not only are they bad, but they distract from any possible appreciation of the music.  Seriously Id on't notice the music because all I hear is tate badly going lah lah lah.\n\nWeight of the world, oh my lord Jesus now I thinks omeone really is doing something horrible to a cat.  I can't believe this is the same man who use to sing songs like Queen of the ryche and silent Lucidity.\n\nThe rest of the songs came out as just boring.\n\nI refuse to listen to the re-recordings of the old songs.  Others have already mentioned how bad they apparently are, and I want NO part of them.\n\nI don't know what the future holds for the Queensryche name.  Hopefully the real band gets the rights, they will always be Queensryche to me.  And any future album I get by them will be labeled as Queensryche.  Redemption is a solid song, so hopefully that's an indication the album will be solid as well, though I'll believe it when I hear it.  There's seriously a reason I haven't bought a Queensryche album since Hear in the now frontier.  And I'm hoping that reason is only Geoff Tate.  Though in fairness the others are to blame too.  They allowed the tates to take over.  I'm just glad they stepped up and finally revolted.  Revolution calling indeed.\n\nBetter album of 2013 so far have been released by these bands, and I'll update it as needed.\nSevendust\nStone sour, which isn't saying much cause it's not a great album\nCoheed and cambria\nKrokus\nCrashdiet, oh my God if you like hard rock you must check out Savage Playground, their new album.

Their newest isn't my favorite but it's ok and better than anything Tateryche has put out over the last decade.\nHelloween repetitive and kind of boring, but 2 really good songs beats this and there are other songs that are ok.\nRob Zombie, sounds pretty weird and uses too many vocal samples for my liking, but still better than this, and anything Rob has released in a long time too, so hey.  Pleasant surprise.\nSoilwork, who's 2013 album the living infinite is really good.\nBlack Sabbath\nMegadeth\nQueensryche, for reals.  it has production issues, but it's still good.\n\nAnd finally any band who doesn't release an album this year, because seriously no album is better than this.  I just can't wait to hear the real Queensryche's album, plus new albums by Megadeth and Black Sabbath with Ozzy.  So there's still good music to be had this year, it just won't come from mr Tate.";My review will probably be as sloppy as this album and I'm ok with that
143;93.0;1.0;24.0;"While it is a very very slight improvement over his latest solo album and much of the recent Queensrche material, it's still not worth buying because of how generic, boring, and awful the music is still (not to mention those laughable re-recorded songs). Plus could his album title and cover art be anymore obvious? It's a pathetic excuse to put out this crap just because he wants to get back the ""other"" Queensrche. It already guarantees I won't be buying this album just based on pure principle. Quite possibly the worst album of the year, maybe even the decade.";Another Abomination in the World of Tate

Listen to it for free on Spotify first and then make the decision to buy it if you think it's great.\n\nRealistically most people will skip on this after listening to it. Why?

Also to point out the obvious... please take the time to look at the 5 star reviews. Totally pathetic... these are people who are friends/paid employees of Geoff Tate and are here to add positive reviews to a turd CD.\n\nThey will have you believe that you can only come on Amazon to review something if you bought it here... that's not true at all. You can review whatever you like on here as long as you own it, have owned it, have heard it, have seen it etc... once you hear it on Spotify you are legit to post a review on here.\n\nWhen you listen to this new recording... try not to laugh when the Xylophone comes on during Dare. lol  Remember Xylophone = Stupidly Heavy\n\nThis CD was rushed, filled with random guest musicians ( don't know why one would do that if you want to showcase your new band members)and\nwritten to obviously get a product out quickly.

152;95.0;5.0;24.0;"The latest release by Queensryche (fronted by Geoff Tate, and frankly the only collaboration of musicians worthy of the name), FREQUENCY UNKNOWN, is by far a great album.  Unfortunately, many people are basing their reviews on unwarranted (did Tate harm them or their families?) personal anger towards a single man.  Let's talk about the music...the MUSIC that Tate creates is and has ALWAYS been top notch, creative, deep and passionate.  Couple that established trait with some truly amazing musicians (many special appearanced on the cd -- Brad Gillis, K.K. Downing, to name a couple) and you have what Tate has always been able to do...ROCK!  Rock hard and heavy, deep and passionate.\nHaving been a Queensryche fan for over 25 years, one thing that the band stood by since the beginning is that they don't like to be ""classified"" or ""put into a box"" or single genre or style of music.  Does THE WARNING sound like RAGE FOR ORDER?  Does RAGE FOR ORDER sound like PROMISED LAND?  Does PROMISED LAND sound like TRIBE?  FREQUENCY UNKNOWN is unique.  It manages to show an evolved Queensryche and yet still be so much a Queensryche album because of Tate's characteristic depth and flair in what I believe is true lyrical poetic genius.\nThe true test is of course to listen and judge for yourself.  If you are into passionate, creative, deep, hard and heavy music with a purpose, I stromgly recommend you give FREQUENCY UNKNOWN a try.  Remember, it's about THE MUSIC!";The true voice can't be denied!

That person dropped the project as soon as he heard the album, so the record label had to scramble and find multiple no names to re-mix the tracks. To top it off, the initial run of FU had already been pressed so the record company had to promise to send a new physical copy to fans unhappy with the ""original"" mix.\n\nNow, the train wreck has arrived for those willing to part with their hard earned money.\n\nStay away!

The production is third rate, and the record label even released a remixed version of the album as a bandaid to try and stop bleeding that should have never been.

Geoff Tate releases a solo record in advance of his court case in November, in which he is fighting his being fired from Queensryche and replaced. That's why the F.U. on the cover. The obvious fist to the face with a big eff you to his former bandmates. Also an allegory to the accusations (since confirmed as truth in interviews) that Geoff Tate assaulted his former bandmates on several occasions, prompting them to let him go. What does he do as retribution? Instead of releasing something that is timely, classic, well produced, and relevant, he released this s*** sandwich. Well done, Geoff. Really. Well done.";This is Geoff Tate's recent solo abortion incorrectly dubbed Queensryche

91;101.0;1.0;21.0;As most other reviews have said this album is nothing more than an uninspired, pompus rush job to get something outthere before the rest of of the band does.  Even the re-recordings of the classic Queens songs are total garbage....none of the passion or intensity the classics has or even the vocals once possessed.  Terrible album.  I hope the other Queens albums comming out is better than this crap.;Already been said.....
104;102.0;1.0;21.0;Who wrote all those 5 star reviews? I hope Geoff is paying his staff overtime for all that creative writing!! This is NOT a Queensryche disc. Queensryche fired Geoff for being a talentless, lifeless lump of his formal self. This is just awfull and does not even deserve a formal review. The REAL Queensryche will be releasing their self titled disc this summer!!  Geoff, you are a no talent turd!!;Are you kidding me??
148;103.0;1.0;21.0;The record company and Geoff Tate have already intimated that sonically this is a substandard effort. How they have the nerve to charge money for an album which will receive a remix in the future to iron out its flaws, I've no idea. On principle DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.;An abomination

6;107.0;4.0;8.0;I had no problem with the mix of the original release (well, the second release of the original) but will say this this remix does add new life to what I thought were already great songs. This album itself is a bit of an enigma to me in that the last few Queensryche release have been a musical departure from the earlier heavier edges style - assumingly due to Tate's influence. Yet when Tate gets kicked out, he puts out this release that is closer to the older original style than anything he has put out in recent years. Just found it odd - but I liked the last few releases anyway - it's all good. I have been a huge fan of it all since I bought that first original EP as a teen back when it first hit the shelves, and I have appreciated all of the ups/downs and style changes over the years. This, to me is a good final chapter of the Tate era of the band (name).;the second release of the original) but will say this this remix does add new life to what I thought were already great songs. T
100;108.0;1.0;20.0;THIS is NOT Queensryche! I couldn't even listen to this CD a second time, it's so bad. Even the old / original Queensryche songs on it sound awful. So sad.;So disappointed
103;109.0;1.0;20.0;"The Queensryche saga gets weirder and weirder. This cd is almost beside the point, it's clearly just an effort to have 'product' out in the marketplace first, to help Geoff Tate with a lawsuit against 3 of the other original members of the band, who will release their Queensryche cd in June!?\n\nAs for the cd, it's terrible. Most of the reviews here concur. 'Cold' the opening track and first single, is a very good modern metal track. It's good, it's catchy, no shame in that. The rest of the cd sounds like it was written and recorded in 6 weeks. It's a mess. It all sounds the same, like one long boring song. All the guest musicians in the world can't save this thing.\n\nBut what I find strange is Tate's motives here. He must want to win the QR name right? So if he does, he will be left with a ""brand"" that no one is interested in. For better or for worse, no one who liked what Queensryche once was will accept them as a cookie-cutter modern rock band. And no one who likes current radio rock, or whatever term you want to call it, has any interest in a band called Queensryche I don't think? To my young nephew Queensryche is a cheesy 80's band who had that 'hit song that sounded like Pink Floyd.' Now he has terrible taste  but he likes current radio rock, and he DOES NOT care about QR. So what ""brand"" would Tate be left with if he wins this lawsuit? He'll be left with nothing? I really don't get it!\n\nDo not buy this cd if you are expecting Queensryche! Because it's not.\n\nGeoff - i'm sure you won't be reading these but if you do, please, just give it up! Let it go. Let the other guys have the name (honestly how much does anyone care about them anymore, the days of this band playing arenas is long gone. Sad but true). And go be a singer/songwriter. That is what I think you want to do. It's ok to not like metal anymore. You still have a good voice!";Bizarre!
130;110.0;1.0;20.0;I have no words for how terrible this album is..Tate's voice is the weakest part of the album which is pretty bad since he's the featured member of the band..buyer beware..this is NOT Queensryche!;As awful as I imagined it would be
136;111.0;1.0;20.0;"I don't like this Queensryche; These samples SUCK S***! nothing against Rudy Sarzo or Simon Wright, veteran rockers, Love Wrights drumming on Dio's ""lock up the wolves album and on Ac/ddc's ""Blow up your video. The only good guitar snippets I heard sounded like ripoffs of Degarmo. This sounds worse than last 'Ryche record. BLAH!";Where's Wilton, Jackson and Rockenfield
157;112.0;1.0;20.0;"First of all I really enjoy early Queensryche.  I've seen them in concert in the early 90's, loved it. 95% of what they've released since Empire has been nothing but a pathetic downward spiral.  Tate has a very distinctive memorable voice. But for whatever reason (age, cigarettes, Insania wine) he's not quite what he used to be. Probably not his fault, everyone ages.  BUT, this album is an obvious and transparent attempt at just trying to get something on the market asap to preempt his former bandmates.  While F.U. is better than almost anything Tate has sung on in many many years, this is faint praise indeed. I mean how hard is it to surpass the drivel that Tate has foisted on the masses since Empire?  I just don't think that his heart is into this type of music anymore, which is fine. Just don't lie about it. Geoff should follow his bliss and make wine and sing his very own style of ""adult contemporary"".  He's just not currently capable of making the type of music that originally made Queensryche famous.  He can't unjump the shark at this point.  Avoid.";The shark has been jumped (a long time ago)
158;113.0;5.0;20.0;I'm just going to keep this simple and straight forward:Ignore the bad reviews. There are SEVERAL (I didn't say ALL) people that are posting reviews that either A. don't own the record or B. Going based on 90 second sound bites. Which is not fair. Geoff Tate and his band truly deliver on this record. Please ignore the bad reviews and make your own decision. You will not be disappointed.;GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!!
67;114.0;5.0;19.0;"I've always looked at new Queensryche albums with a great deal of excitement... I compare it to a child on Christmas morning. ""Frequency Unknown"" was no different. The first thing that crossed my mind was ""Oh boy, what's he got in store for us this time?"" I could hardly wait to get my hands on it and listen to it. From the opening notes of ""Cold"" to the fading end notes on the re-record of ""Silent Lucidity""... This is a hands down winner. It ROCKS. You can't get any harder than this without putting yourself into a whole other genre... Which is funny if you stop and think about it, because Geoff Tate absolutely HATES the concept of labeling music as such and such a type. By labeling music you're putting these bands in a box, he says, and that hinders the ability of the listener to be able to freely enjoy the music. I tend to agree. Queensryche was loosely labeled as ""thinking man's metal"" and people immediately thought ""Oh well they're not metal so they're not cool"". Labels do nothing good for music as a whole, and ""Frequency Unknown"" stands in defiance of all attempts to stick it in a box and say it's a certain type of music when really it's not.\n\n""Cold"" was the first single from the album and when I first heard it all I could think was ""Holy (insert epithet here)!"" It literally took my breath away, it's that powerful. That was my first taste of what ""F.U."" had in store for us... And as with many others who truly appreciate music for what it's worth, I wanted more. I couldn't wait to hear it all. I'll spare you the track by track rundown because that would take away a lot of the allure, but I will give you my thoughts about it as a whole.\n\nQueensryche has always been known for their diversity. Their ever-changing sound that never seemed to degrade as time went on. They never had the same sound twice on any album... And that holds true for ""F.U."" The underlying difference between ""F.U."" and any previous album is that other than Geoff Tate, the lineup is completely different. Kelly Gray and Robert Sarzo on guitar that leaves you breathless and wondering what the license plate was of that twin guitar assault... Rudy Sarzo on bass with a performance that borders on a bass playing clinic as he shows you how it's done... Randy Gane on keyboards adding a new depth to the songs, that extra resonance makes it stand out even more... And the one and only Simon Wright on drums, a monster of a talent driving this musical ship in the right direction. When you have a collection of talent like this, fronted by one of the most influential voices in music today, and the end result is a harmonic symphony that leaves your ears weeping at the end because it's over. Other people may find issues with the singer, not me. If it weren't for Geoff Tate, there would BE no Queensryche name and legacy to fight over! A lot of people seem to have forgotten the other side begged him to leave Myth and join them. If he hadn't, music as we know it would be totally different. Queensryche has redefined music in general. The constantly evolving sound, the way the songs grab you by the throat and don't let go until the last note fades away, the sheer POWER in the music... Would we be here today if he'd never said yes? I don't think so. No one man makes the band, but one would certainly be inclined to believe it were true when it comes to Geoff Tate.\n\nThis album is driven by passion. The first notes of ""Cold"" say as much. I find the previous lineup to have been detrimental to the drive and inner fire Geoff Tate brings with him every time he goes to write music. When one is surrounded by people with no passion, no drive, one does what one can to create it, even if there is a distinct vacuum. There's no such vacuum anywhere on ""F.U."" and I'd be VERY hard pressed to find it. These songs are brilliantly put together... And if you don't agree, I challenge you to listen with an open mind and see for yourself why I've called them my favorite band for the last 20 years. THIS is the lineup I want to see... THIS is my Queensryche.";"""Frequency Unknown"" ROCKS!!!"
114;115.0;5.0;19.0;"Not sure what all the hate is about - this is great music!  I can only assume there is a bit of a conspiracy to keep people from buying this due to the current politics of the band.  Although not everyone likes everything, it seems with such a great record that there seems to be an overkill of people ""not liking"" it....Don't let the ugliness get in the way of great music!";Great Album!!!
144;116.0;4.0;19.0;I'm one of those fans that felt that the direction of the band after Promised Land became less and less interesting with each new release. I don't have anything against trying new things on each release but IMO, the band drifted farther and farther away from what interested me in the first place. I think that the changes in musical and business vision over time, are what contributed to the three original members contributing less and less to each new release and firing Geoff. Outside writers were brought in and Geoff to me, gradually lost interest in maintaining his incomparable vocal range and writing heavy music. This continuously watered down their original brilliance.\nAll that being said, I think Geoff's new CD is very good. I like the crunchy guitars and Geoff seems to have put a lot more effort into his vocals this time. I also like the idea of bringing in an all star cast of musicians to record these songs.\nMy favorite songs on the CD are In The Hands Of God, Cold, The Weight Of The World and Everything.\nRe-recording the original songs to me, was a mistake. A live DVD would have been  a better idea,as you can't improve on perfection. The original recordings are classic.\nLastly, this is the most Queensryche sounding CD vocally that Geoff has written to date. I would like to see this new direction continue as Geoff moves forward with his solo career. I think most Queensryche fans would enjoy this heavier direction.\nI also enjoy the other bands direction and their new vocalist very much. For me, they are now the true Queensryche. Hopefully, this split will give all the former and present members of Queensryche a new lease on life. The other band by far, seems to be revitalized and hungry again.\nI also think that Geoff moving forward, absolutely needs to find stronger musicians to tour / record with, especially the two guitarists. Glenn Drover would have been perfect. To me, Geoff needs to hire capable players that fit his style of music. He needs Symphony X or Dream Theater level players and deserves to record / play with them.\nThe new band members, maybe with the exception of Rudy Sarzo are either very weak in ability, feel, or just not suited overall to Geoff's style of music.\nThanks for reading this review.;Geoff Tate's Best Solo CD By Far
145;117.0;5.0;19.0;I had doubts that this could rock but man was I wrong! I hated the last 2 CD's but this one sounds fresh. Do not listen to the soundbites because I did and I was not impressed at first but I gave the CD a shot and now I can't wait for them to come to Philly and play it live. It was way worth the $10, way to go Geoff and new band members!!!;Amazing!!!!
166;118.0;4.0;19.0;Regardless of all the drama surrounding Queensryche lately, if you listen to the album and ignore who's name is on the front, it's a good album.  The production and mixing is a bit uneven since it was done by different people, but the songs all sound good on my headphones and in my car, so I'm not complaining.  I would have liked to see a new spin on the old classics instead of trying to replicate the originals though.\n\nThe vocals are on par or a tad better than other recent QR/GT releases.  The lyrics are good, but the theme of 'jilted lover' is used a bit too much.\n\nMusically, each song is strong and I like the fact that each song features a solo from a 'guest' guitarist.  It adds some new sounds to each song and makes each one feel a bit different.\n\nThe music sounds like something off Dedicated to Chaos or Kings and Thieves and personally, I enjoyed these albums.  If you enjoyed those albums, then Frequency Unknown is an album you'll enjoy.;Not really Queensryche, but a good album from Geoff Tate
171;119.0;1.0;19.0;"I don't have to even hear this to know that it's an abomination. I 've had enough of the ""one original member"" band reformations, and this whole story of the two Q's is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. They should definitely make a movie (a la ""Rockstar"") out of this story. The bottom line is: Tate alone is bad, but the band without Tate is going to be just as pointless. Why? They haven't put out a decent album since ""Promised Land"" and that was because of Chris Degarmo. Look at the songwriting credits on all the great Q albums, and you'll see his name on about 95% of them. They've been nothing but a sub-standard metal band since that album. But this whole ""two Queensryches"" thing is ridiculous and points to the fact that they should ALL hang it up, once and for all. There's a lot better music out there to spend time on without wasting your ears on ANY of these guys!";Time to quit and get real day-jobs, guys!
68;120.0;5.0;18.0;With all the back and forth of love and hate my advice to anyone curious of this album is to try for yourself. Let it spin. Sit back and listen with an open mind and heart. Don't let others' thoughts and opinions cloud your own. Soak in the music and the vocals of what this version of Queensryche has to offer.\n\nBut in my own personal opinion I think from the start it's a lot harder than any other Queensryche albums put out before. There's a flow binding one song to the next yet keeping it different from the last. True progression as Queensryche have always prided themselves on. It is hard to pick just one or two songs as a favorite. Just when you think you have one, you find another just as awesome. I like how this new line up sounds. They really bring the passion with every note they play. It sounds very natural, as if they were just playing around in the studio and this is what it resulted in. It blends very well with Geoff Tate's own vocals. I find it very balanced between music and vocals, like no one man is greater than another. As a band should be. And bonus re-recorded songs I find very interesting. Most people find it sacrilege, but I would have to disagree. The re-recording of Jet City Woman sounds far better than the original. It sounds like a much stronger sounding song, full passion and drive giving the old song new life. This is how it should have sounded from the start. I find Rudy Sarzo a much better bassist than Eddie Jackson.\n\nWhether it's new songs or old ones redone, Geoff Tate pulls you in and makes you believe in what he's singing and the new line up brings the fire power in their music. It doesn't matter whose side you are on, this album is one for the collection.;Gotta hear for yourself
87;121.0;1.0;18.0;This is an absolute disaster of an album.  It's time for GT to retire.  It will be interesting to hear what the other Queensryche will put together in their forthcoming album.;Gross
90;122.0;1.0;18.0;I seriously laughed at how bad this album is when I was listening to it.  Oh, my.  Geoff, have you no shame?\n\nSaying he phoned it in would be generous.  More like he got drunk and noticed there was a microphone nearby.;Wow.  So horrible it's funny.
92;123.0;2.0;18.0;IF U LOOK AT THE CD AS A GEOFF TATE SOLO CD WITH GUEST STARS IT IS OK,THE FIRST SONG cold ISNT BAD........BUT THE REMAKES ARE TERRIBLE OF THE QUEENSCYHE CLASSIC SONGS;GEOFF TATE NOT QUEENSRYCHE ?
116;124.0;5.0;18.0;I DONT KNOW WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE FANS BASHING THIS CD. I LOVE IT I THINK ITS UNIQUE AND HEAVY. HEY DONT GET ME WRONG I LOVE THE OLD RYCHE MUSIC, BUT COME ON PEOPLE ITS 2013 GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU DONT LIKE THE CD, DONT BUY IT. LEAVE IT FOR THE FANS WHO LOVE GEOFF'S WORK. IF YOU ARE THAT BORED AND HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT BASH THIS GUYS WHO FOR SO MANY YEARS GAVE US HIS HEART AND SOUL IN HIS MUSIC, THEN GET A LIFE. SO DISRESPECTFULL. GIVE IT A CHANCE AND DONT EXPECT IT TO BE\nTHE MUSIC FROM 1981. ITS GREAT LOUD,COOL GUITARS, AND JUST ENJOYABLE. GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE YOU MISERABLE HATERS...... ROCK ON GEOFF!!!!!!;YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!
117;125.0;1.0;18.0;Does anyone have an extra bag just lying around that Geoff Tate could use to hold a note in?  I'm trying to help someone that can no longer carry something around anymore.\n\nOkay, all kidding aside.........this Geoff Tate really reminds me a lot of a lead singer of a band that I used to love back in the 80's & 90's called Queensryche.;When is the final straw, at what point do we give up on Geoff Tate and move onto the next guy??
123;126.0;2.0;18.0;I preordered this album right when I found out about it. The main reason I purchased this is because yes, I love Geoff Tate's voice...but what caught my eye is the new line-up with one of the best bass players of all time, Rudy Sarzo and his brother on guitar! Right when I saw that I had to buy it...and then to top it off Simon Wright on drums who kicks major ass. Well after receiving the CD (3 days after the release...thanks Tin-Man, I should've just went to Best Buy the day of release) I wasn't quite thrilled. Mainly because Rudy only plays on 3 tracks (and you can barely hear him), Robert Sarzo only on one track as well as Simon. This was very misleading because I thought this lineup would be on every song. However, there are some incredible musicians on this album...KK Downing I was really interested to hear but once I did it seemed like his solo didn't even go well or match the song. The only song I thought was excellent is Cold. The rest are just okay...and the re-recordings I couldn't enjoy much...I didn't care for a random guy playin all the instruments. I hope Geoff does another album with Rudy and the boys...but take more time and do not RUSH it. And shouldn't be using the QR name considering he's the only member from that band. If you really want to hear this wait for a cheap used copy on eBay. I am expecting the real Queensrche album coming out in June to blow this away because they are doing it the right way and going back to the old sound. No offense to Geoff...keep doing what you're doin but call the band something different like Operation Mindcrime...not QR.;Tatesrche
236;127.0;5.0;18.0;I'm like everyone else on here but being that I am a Queensryche fan for many years I at least gave it a chance. After hearing the 'Cold' single I was really intrigued to hear what the rest of the album sounded like.\n\nIt was worth the wait... the songs are great!!! This Album ROCKS!!!;Skeptical But Now A Believer!
241;128.0;5.0;18.0;Mr. Tate and this new blood have something special going on in this new release. THANK YOU for a kick ass album! DARE is insane and one of my favorites. The Ryche belongs to this band....the 'old' line up that tossed Geeff out are FISH ON LAND.;INFREAKINGCREDIBLE SOUND!
251;129.0;5.0;18.0;"So worth the wait. New material that rocks! I am digging ""Cold"" and "" In The Hands of God"" is EPIC.  The guitar work is amazing. The bonus tracks are all my favorite Queensryche tracks. This is a must get for hardcore fans.";AWESOME!!!
11;130.0;1.0;14.0;One really good song and thats it. I saw the Anniv. Mind Crime Tour this year and as great as he's been Geoff should move on. The voice is not what it was. And did I mention Geoff is the only original band member on this recording.;Save Your $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
62;131.0;1.0;17.0;If there was ever an album that epitomizes the true spirit of rock n roll, it is Queensryche's Frequency Unknown. Sure you've read all the bad reviews from long-time fans calling this album terrible and unlistenable, but at the end of the day, who are you going to believe? The fans that have been there since the 80's supporting this band through thick and thin or TheGeoff Tate, who has lived it all personally? I mean, c'mon the guy always puts the fans first. At Rocklahoma, the fans were less than enthusiastic and he pumped them up and made them respect TheGeoff. What other lead singer does that? Those fans will remember that show the rest of their lives!  At another recent show, a fan was in the front row recording Queensryche's performance on his iPhone. TheGeoff took that smartphone (which as we all know can be an expensive burden) and threw it deep into the crowd, essentially saving that fan at least $150 in cellphone bills a month. What other lead singer does that?\n\nAs for the album itself, TheGeoff is so professional that he doesn't need long recording sessions or months of tweaking an album. He knows it is great right off the bat and takes only 3 months from conception to release. Now THAT'S a musician! He even took it upon himself to hire a group of down and out has-been musicians and gave them a paying gig out of the goodness of his heart. Talk about a helping hand to humanity!\n\nIn conclusion, please buy multiple copies of this album. Buy a box of Insania wine (wine comes in a box, right?) and experience what will be remembered as THE album of the year, if not the decade. If there is a better record produced this year, I'll have to hear it to believe it. I just don't think it's possible.;VEST-acular!
107;132.0;2.0;17.0;"While the album is ok, it's not an actual Queensryche album, seeing that only one member of this line up was a contributing member of Queensryche. The vocals are weak, production is muddy and sloppy, and to prove a point, why is none of this material being played live? Because the ""band"" Tate put together didn't record it, so they need extra time to learn it.\n\nJune is when the actual Queensryche album comes out. Save your money for that";A good solo album, but not a QR album
125;133.0;3.0;17.0;To start with, let me disclose that I am on team Queensryche not team Tate. Geoff (who's first name is actually Jeffrey with a J) Tate is a massive douche bag with no respect for his fans.  He is also a phenomenal singer.  That's not a typo.  He IS still a great singer even though he can't hit the notes he used to.  So I still had hope for this record.\n  Frequency Unknown definitely fits in more with post-Promised Land Queensryche sound than the early stuff. That said, there are more 'metal' parts than any of the more recent records.  That's good and bad as sometimes they seem out of place.  It seems Geoff Tate has heard all the complaints from fans and just chose to ignore them until now. He knows the real Queensryche is gonna make a metal album so he doesn't wanna get shown up.  Therein lies the over arching problem with FU (ugh, really Geoff? really?) it sounds contrived.  The only reason he made it was to piss off his former band.\n  HOWEVER....its actually a decent album. If the band never split and this album came out I think it would be getting a lot of praise. Especially after American Soldier and Dedicated To Chaos.  I guess that makes it the best Queensryche album in years (for the next few weeks at least).  If you can listen to the album without any preconceptions (i won't fault you if you can't), there's a lot to enjoy. I'm not saying rush out and buy it (I didn't, thank God for Spotify) but can truly say it's worth the listen.\n  As for the re-recorded classics, they're unnecessary at best.  They come off sounding flat, which to be fair may be purely a production issue, but there's nothing new to make them worthwhile.;its not bad
26;134.0;1.0;16.0;"I am a long-time QR fan.  I am usually favorable to any album I review by them, and needless to say I reserve 1 star reviews truly for albums by anyone that are the worst of the worst in general - as my review history would attest to.  I am probably one of the few people on earth who liked ""Q2K"" and thought ""American Soldier"" was a great album.  So I try to listen to everything and give it it's shot before judging based on the court of public opinion.\n\nHowever, after listening to this album through twice with great effort, I can say this album fits firmly in that special 1-star category - worse than Geoff Tate's latest solo outing and worse than ""Dedicated to Chaos"".  Here is why -\n\nMis-labelled:\nWith the exception of the lead singer, this is not a Queensryche album.  It is a Geoff Tate solo album utilizing a revolving door of backing musicians and outside writers.  Geoff Tate was unceremoniously fired from the real Queensryche after the band had exhausted all other options in trying to work with him for years.  He has physically threatened his former bandmates to the point that security had to accompany everyone onto the stage for their last few performances together.  Subsequent facts have come to light that he was using Queensryche assets to fund his other unrelated projects without the bands knowledge, so needless to say, he is no longer part of Queensryche at all save for a temporary privilege to use the name until the courts can straighten out the controversy, so obviously Rockenfeld, Wilton, and Jackson had absolutely no part in this release whatsoever - which in this case is to their credit.  There is nothing stylistically resembling anything that made QR unique and special - even on their later releases after ""Promised Land"".  Just like Tate defrauded QR's bank accounts to fund other bands his family was involved in, this is a transparent fraudulent attempt to hijack the Queensryche name, and in my opinion - purposfully tarnish it.  On the basis of the false advertising alone this wretched slice of mediocrity deserves one star.\n\nPoorly mixed:\nThis is actually only partially true, as the songs were all recorded at various studios with different musicians and no doubt different engineers - not in and of itself a crime - but you can tell just how patchwork and rushed this effort was.  On one track the guitars are over-powering, another the mix is dead, and the quality varies throughout.  There is no continuity in the recording quality or the sequencing of the tracks.\n\nSloppy:\nGeoff Tate takes most of the hit on this one, as most of the musical performances are competent if not stellar.  However, there are tracks where you can hear him straining to hit notes to the point that his voice starts to crack - and they didn't even attempt to clean these up (check out the chorus of ""Running Backwards"").  I don't care how old the guy is.  If you can't sing a particular track, write something that you can sing within your range! The vocal performances are absolutely abysmal and absolutely destroy any nugget of  potential goodness in these tracks.  When he's not struggling with his greatly diminished range, he sounds uniformally flat and tired throughout, even on the re-recordings of the classic tracks at the end of the album.\n\nBland:\nThe writing itself is by-the-numbers adult metal.  There are no standout tracks at all.  Even ""Kings & Thieves"" - for all the negative attention it's received - had at least 2 tracks that made it onto my daily playlist.  Tate and all of the various cooks involved in writing these tracks have managed to put together a collection of songs that can best be described as pedestrian and unmemorable adult metal.  The classic re-recordings add no new twist on the originals and sound like the rest of the album - dead and rushed.  You can probably find better renditions of them on bootleg performance CD's in a cuban flea market.\n\nTheme:\nNo disrespect to them, but I don't believe even proud-to-be-sleazy groups like Motley Crue would put something like this on an album cover.  Is this the same name attached to such great albums like Operation Mindcrime and Empire?  Is this the same group fans bestowed the ""thinking mans metal"" moniker to?\n\nIn closing.......\nThis is not the first QR release not featuring QR members that has been put out over the last 15 years, but it is special with regard to how it doesn't even try to live up to the storied legacy the band had established over their career.  Why might this be?\n\nLooking at the circumstances that led to the release of this album (which is quite impossible to not do given the very public way this man has represented himself to the media), I would speculate listening to it that Tate is purposfully trying to sabotage the Queensryche name and make a quick buck in the process.  He already knows his goose is likely cooked with regard to obtaining the naming rights - which is why he has flocked to the media once again to re-frame the debate as a monetary/bidding issue.  The QR brand has little value to him at this point, so I speculate the F-U is probably meant for his former band-mates, but it sure seems to be directed at QR fans as well.\n\nWith respect to Tate's attempt to control the media following his subsequent and embarrassing exit from Queensryche, it is no surprise that there are so many 5-star shills rating this album, and they are welcome to flame away in their mostly obviously sponsored posts.  It is breath-taking to watch certain sectors of the online media try rally around this obviously sub-par effort.  To date I believe he and his wife still run the Queensryche.com site - but I have not checked.  Last time I was there you would think this guy is the greatest thing since sliced bread and none of the other members who fired him ever existed - go figure.\n\nBut there is nothing that will fool any fan who ventures to listen to this into believing that this album is anything other than what it is - a last desperate cash-in from a bitter, washed-up, egomaniac who at one time might have been great, but is now way past the end of his shelf-life, and unable or unwilling to accept the great responsibility he's had in dragging the QR brand through the mud.\n\n1 star means this album is not just merely bad.  It is a complete fraud.  However, if you understandably aren't concerned about the integrity of the product, I recommend at least listening to the samples before you buy to ensure you'll be happy with the quality.  The 2 full listens on my legal music service is the only support it will receive from me, and I would take those back if I could.\n\nThank you for reading.";Bland, poorly mixed, sloppy, and mis-labelled.
186;135.0;5.0;17.0;Hmmm ... I knew when I saw the first five reviews all giving FU just 1 star that Mr Tate didn't stand a chance. Is it the quality of the music or perhaps those (along with many others it appears) that see Tate's Judas-like antics as the cause for the doppelganging of our beloved Queensryche?\n\nMy mother told me never to take sides, so it was with an open mind that I approached FU, and as such was rewarded with an album that I didn't think possible. After the unmitigated disaster of `Chaos', this could have been carnage, but it is one of the best albums to bear the Queensryche name. Sure it's no `Empire', `Rage', or even `Promised Land', but for me it's up there with the overrated `Mind Crime' (flame away everyone ... you know you want to!)\n\nRarely do bands succeed with new front men, so it will be interesting to see how Q2 (or Q1 depending on how you see it) fare. Whether or not Tate got the album out sooner to beat his rivals is of no value (personally I would have gone second if that was the case), but musically this is a major achievement with strong songs, excellent production (despite what some may say), great musicianship and a long overdue return to form for Tate.\n\nLyrically it's a bit too personal at times (akin to rappers dissing their former colleagues), but if that's how he feels ... that's how he feels. Ultimately the winners are those that give him a chance, taking FU as a damn good rock album and (more importantly) a Queensryche album. I wonder what De Garmo makes of this? My guess he's looking to see which horse wins and then (when both parties realize the error of their ways) will reunite with the original line up, tour the hind legs off their legendary back catalogue and all will be well again.\n\nBUT ... I would have dropped the bonus four rerecordings' as they offer absolutely nothing except to show that Tate and his troubadours can cut the old songs when they go on the road. In which case it was genius.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see what the other Queensryche come up. More (as in collectively) Queensryche than Tate, they too should deliver a good album as long as their new vocalist balances his own style with what the fans want/expect. Otherwise they may end up as a tribute band of themselves.\n\nSo at the end of it all, will the real Queensryche please stand up as this is sad. It's us the fans that are losing out over their squabbles. Or after FU, perhaps we are getting two for the price of one. My old teacher would have grabbed both by the ears, dragged them face to face and made them say `sorry'!;Allegiance
66;136.0;1.0;16.0;Frequency Unknown's musical attributes are pretty easily defined even through a couple of casual spins. You have a few decent cuts (Cold, Weight Of The World, In The Hands Of God), four awful and unnecessary re-records, and a whole lot of guest musicians. Otherwise, its a whole lot of insincere tough guy posturing and Breaking Benjamin B-sides. Oh, and neither the original mixes or the remixes really cut it for me.\n\nAnd with that out of the way, it's time to dig a little deeper into why F.U exists at all. Because there are fundamental problems here beneath the music that serve as an impetus for their creation. Plus, sometimes a man has to stand up and tell it like it is...and there's never been a better time for the real QR fans, like myself, to do so.\n\nThe problem with Frequency Unknown isn't necessarily the fact that it sounds like garbage (because it does), but rather that it's impossible for me to award anything greater than 1 star to an album that was calculatedly constructed (in less than 2 months at that!) for Geoff Tate's sole benefit in his bid to win at court later this year. To add insult to injury, it is being marketed under a brand he was FIRED from last year, a situation that would be laughable even under the best of circumstances. Seeing supposedly intelligent, self-aware individuals defending his course of action, however, doesn't give me much confidence in their capacity for critical thinking.\n\nIn any case, you can smell the BS from miles away...and unfortunately, Tate seems to have thoroughly enjoyed systematically destroying every ounce of respect I had for him growing up. I haven't been that keen on his output with Gray and Slater since the early 2000's (Q2K onwards), but he's really outdone himself in sheer awfulness as the years have gone on. One man doesn't make a QR, yet the hundreds of people showing up at his venues seem to think it somehow does. To these fools, I ask the following question: a lot of his antics over the last ten years wouldn't be condoned in some other kind of business: what makes him think he can get away with awful behavior (questionable management decisions, physically assaulting his band members, the backstabbing over the film adaptation rights to OMC) despite not being a majority shareholder in a corporation he helped create? You vote with your money, and yet you choose to spend it on someone like him. What does that say about you, the supposedly enlightened consumer?\n\nIf F.U. had been the best sounding and most intricately fashioned record that Tate had been involved in since Promised Land, I wouldn't have minded buying it despite all this. However, when the best he can do is sing over post-grunge songs that Slater has pulled out of his backyard shed and rope in dozens of high profile guests to create the illusion that everything's alright, then you can't expect me to give him my money in good conscience. He's already done a great job at destroying his voice (smoking, drinking, etc.) since the good ol' days. Do I really need to hand him my billfold as he destroys his career as well?;Frequency Unknown: Behind The Facade
69;137.0;5.0;16.0;"One of Geoff's best releases yet!! I'm so excited to see the new direction that Geoff is taking the REAL Queensryche and I'm thrilled to see he's able to branch out in the direction he deserves, without the dead weight to hold him back anymore....Great CD; fans are loving it judging from his sell-out shows!";Frequency Unknow
80;138.0;1.0;16.0;"This album is the pinnacle of inept, pretentious, and soulless songwriting. It was not enough for Geoff Tate to ruin the legacy of Queensrche, but to retrospectively butcher classic songs. The treatment of Queensrche classics from albums like ""Operation: Mindcrime"" and ""Empire"" were enough to make me recoil in horror. This album fails at every opportunity conceivable: the art, production, lyrics, songwriting, and originality are all cold reminders of where Geoff is at creatively these days.\n\nThis album was put together way too fast, and serves as a painful testament to how far Geoff's voice has fallen from his glory days. It's difficult for me to believe that any of the guest musicians actually performed on this record because of how poor and uninspired all of the songs are. I'm a big fan of Ty Tabor, KK Downing, Dave Meniketti, and Rudy Sarzo, but they don't even register on this entire record. On cuts like ""Slave"" it sounds like they can barely keep time.\n\nThis record is exactly what it looks like; a giant ""F.U."" to anyone picking up a copy. It is an affront to the legacy, concept, and integrity of Queensrche and an ostentatious, histrionic, and childish mess of an ""album"". The lyrics are insultingly vapid and self-indulgent, and the music is regressing far passed generic. It didn't have to be ""metal"", it didn't have to be ""progressive"", it just needed a modicum of taste or effort.\n\nAll of the albums shortcomings could be saved by a great vocal performance, but sadly, Geoff Tate doesn't deliver. He hasn't delivered since 1998, and there appears to be absolutely no hope he ever will. If he changed his style--like many metal vocalists do successfully-- and accounted for changes in his deteriorating / aging voice, this record would be a lot more palatable. Geoff Tate's decision to sing outside of his comfort zone results in a very shrill, uncontrolled, and unconvincing performance. The extremes of Geoff's range have been utterly demolished by cigarettes and age. The lows and highs both sound absolutely wrecked (good examples being the re-recordings of ""Silent Lucidity"" and ""I Don't Believe in Love""). This style worked for HITNF, was acceptable for ""Q2k"", but he simply can't handle it anymore. He sounds like a poor carbon-copy of 1977 Peter Gabriel-- a significant influence on Tate-- and Adam Sandler's Opera Man.\n\nIf you're a Queensrche completionist, I still can't recommend this record. Just stay away.";So disappointed
15;139.0;1.0;14.0;"All I had to do was listen to the 2013 ""remakes"" at the end of this album.  Tate fails at his own material.  What the hell was the point of rerecording those tracks?

61;142.0;2.0;15.0;I've always been a fan of Geoff Tate, but this album is embarrassing. When I got it I was gonna put it on for a friend who has never heard about Queensrche (too young). After having bragged about Geoff's voice, I felt embarrassed listening to this album. The 4 bonus remakes were terrible. Geoff's voice has lost the edge. He sounds tired and he can't hit the high notes any longer. I had to stop the cd, and dig out the old stuff for my friend. Too bad.;Embarassing
77;143.0;5.0;15.0;A lot has been said about this record and there are obviously a lot of Geoff Tate haters out there as a result of some bad publicity, coming both from the other Queensryche members and Geoff himself. This album (which should be labelled as a Geoff Tate solo record) is a hard hitting rock album. The remix is great (got mine as a free replacement from Cleopatra records that was shipped very quickly and I live in the UK), they really should have just waited to get that mix out instead of rushing. It seems there was a general rush to get this out for obvious reasons and the lousy packaging and original mix show this. However, this is a great bunch of songs, the heaviest collection from Tate/Queensryche in a long time and it easily surpasses most of the records released since Empire (Promised Land and American Soldier being the exceptions).\nIn my opinion neither of the two Queensryches should have the original name, after all without the two original main songwriters (DeGarmo and Tate) how can it truly be Queensryche? This album is worth a listen I really enjoyed it.;Powerful Hard Rock, Ignore the haters!
101;144.0;5.0;15.0;"The rush job and bad original mix to beat the remainder band members to the punch is quite the drama. The Remix, available for full CD listen on Rdio is EXCELLENT, these superbly crafted tunes are so clear that I can almost hear Hater's loathing and jealousy seeping through. Is this a Mind Crime?  Are we all just pawns mindlessly fueling a fire of drama driven success? Hater's are creating, feeding and raising a Hype Monster....twisting and turning in their critical spiraling bent dialogue of despair over lost glory of past performances and recordings. Go turn in your best Hater's Rant and win the contest!  The rest of us have moved on and like what we hear. CD sales are good considering the ""Hater"" effect, concerts adding more and more tour dates. I've been listening to this CD over a week and can't get enough of it.

227;147.0;5.0;15.0;"As has always been the case with me and QR/GT material, there is much time ahead and much to explore in a new album. After hearing it on the Cleopatra website and now once in my favorite listening environment, full range, off the CD, it is clear there is a new musical adventure awaiting me.\n\n I do not make assessments based on online samples>computer soundcard> computer speakers. To do so would be absurd for me as that chain kills the life of any song and hides many layers that are often crucial pieces of the listening puzzle.  6 weeks or not, the songs are very well constructed, heavily guitar driven, and there is a great deal of movement in the arrangements and mixes. The atmospheric sonic landscape and haunting/powerful vocals are all present as usual.\n\nThe guest musicians, as someone pointed out earlier bring a fresh feel, but also mark possibly a new period for GT that does not revolve around the obsessively polished feel that we have always had from QR. The re-recorded ""classics"" are obvious examples of this. While a bit disconcerting at first, I started to enjoy the raw feel and hearing GT as he sounds now without extensive hours of studio polish. Very organic. If one is a GT fan I believe they will enjoy it as well. If not, probably not.\n\nI don't much care about the details of the breakup. Most of us know there are 3 sides to every story. I don't much care about GT's personal life as I don't know him. What I do care about is whether or not I enjoy the music. After the first full range listen, I am very excited to learn the album further, and yes, I will buy the version with the newer mixes just for fun. As it is, it's a boatload better sounding than the last Maiden album, so I'm not too concerned.\n\nOne final note. It is my fervent belief that one cannot accurately assess a GT/QR effort without having a firm grasp on the vocals, vocal timing and vocal arrangements. After all, he has always been the centerpiece. Deep familiarity with the vocals seems to unlock the rest of the tune and put everything in it's proper place. Lack of familiarity can leave the use of dissonance, tension and release, and instrument interplay confusing to the listener. It is surprising even to me, how many GT tunes I've heard that sounded awkward at first until I became intimately familiar with the vocal, then to discover a monster of a tune. I expect more of the same on Frequency Unknown.";Looking forward to a year of discovery
238;148.0;5.0;15.0;"Songs like ""Cold"", ""Slave"" and ""Weight Of The World"" show that Geoff Tate easily has more left in the tank. The ""other"" band?  Sorry mates, but Todd La Torre simply ""couldn't carry Geoff Tate's jock strap"" (a boxing quote from Larry Holmes, folks, - so ease up !)  Seems Scott Rockenfield and Company have enlisted their fan club/street team to carry the text assaults below - same comments can be read over at Blabbermouth by exactly the same perps.

102;154.0;4.0;14.0;"Updated Review:\nListening to this album a few more times and comparing it against the latest real Queensryche album Condition Human, I have to say I actually like this one better.  The tracks are more varied in style and emotion and overall sound. I wanted to really hate this album for all the reasons I list in my original post. Much of the vitriol directed at this album has more to do with fan outrage than with actual objective evaluation of the music (in my opinion). The re-recordings of classic Ryche songs are still disgraceful, but I find that the new tracks are actually enjoyable.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis really is a Geoff Tate solo album backed by a serviceable Queensryche cover band. Frequency Unknown should have been called ""Brain Frequency Unknown"" because Tate has clearly lost his mind. From telling the original Queensryche band members and their fans ""F.U."" on the cover, to re-branding the Queensryche website with only images of Tate, it is clear that in his mind, he alone is Queensryche. Yeah - right. I am a huge fan of Queensryche's early work and it pains me to see this split almost as much as it pains me to hear this album, but not nearly as much as the pain and insult from being told to ""F-off"" on the album cover.\n\nThe good news is that most of the original band members plan to release an album and tour under the Queensryche banner with a singer who I am told sounds a lot like Mr. Tate in his prime. They could actually consider changing their name to ""The Ryche"", since the ""Queen"" of the Ryche has left the band. And I am sure they will take the high road and offer thoughtful music with a tasteful and respectable album cover and theme.\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rage-For-Order-Remastered-Expanded-Edition/dp/B000THKF7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rage For Order (Remastered) [Expanded Edition</a>]is Queensryche's true master piece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Mindcrime/dp/B0000931QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation: Mindcrime</a>is a close second, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Empire/dp/B00009L1UP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Empire</a>&nbsp;is excellent and I'm sure still pays their bills.  So from the perspective of a long time fan, I offer the following critique with as open a mind as I can muster given the circumstances. Even though this is not a Queensryche album, it is arguably a Queensryche related side project and worthy of consideration, despite the insanity that surrounds it. The songs worth listening to are marked with ** below:\n\n**Track 01 - Cold: Decent guitar riff and pretty simple straight forward rock tune.\n\n**Track 02 - Dare: Setting aside the fact that the lyrics appear antagonistic toward the founding Queensryche members, this song is well constructed with interesting changes, synth effects, and is an enjoyable listen.\n\nTrack 03 - Give it to you: An uninspired and typical Tate slow jam. My answer to his lyrics ""How do you like my so far?"" - I liked you a lot better as a vampire raging for order and long before you went BSC (Bat ___ Crazy).\n\nTrack 04 - Slave: Skip this track. Not sure what it's doing on this album. The guitar solo is interesting and sounds out of place in this song. If the rest of the song was based on this mood and approach it would be much better IMO.\n\nTrack 05 - In the hands of God: I was not crazy about this song when it was called Disconnected on Promised Land.\n\n**Track 06 - Running Backwards: A respectable heavy metal tune. Not very progressive or ground breaking, but a solid effort with decent vocals.\n\n**Track 07 - Life Without You: This song is pretty well constructed and generally listenable. However, the lead guitar work and underlying riff again sounds out of place in this song.\n\n**Track 08 - Everything: Cool guitar riff, great vocal work, a fun listen. It gets a little repetitive toward the end but otherwise worth a listen.\n\nTrack 10 - Fallen: Another typical Tate slow jam.\n\nTrack 10 - Weight of the World:\n\nCover Tracks: Listen to Geoff's cover band play old Queensryche tunes at the end of this record and you'll get the full appreciation for the fact that this literally is a cover band masquerading as Queensryche and the covers are OK but clearly not as good as the original recordings. It's telling that the cover songs are from OMC and Empire - no ""Tribe"" or ""Q2K"" songs thankfully.\n\nI don't like most of this album, and I don't want to like the few songs that are actually listenable. Wish we were not put in this position as fans. I hope you find this guide useful.";The Queen is dead - Long live The Ryche
133;155.0;4.0;14.0;I did not read any reviews from other listeners before I bought this album.  I saw Queensryche w/o Tate about two months ago.  I spent my time comparing the new vocalist to Geoff.  I came away disappointed because I wanted things to be the same... they're NOT the same!  The landscape has changed.  While I agree this is not Geoff's best work, he has built his career on musical/vocal talent.  There are no signs he intends to throw in the towel.  We need to listen to the new Queensryche families on their own talent and judge w/o comparison.  I admit, it is going to be hard, but we'll always have their previous stuff to remind us of their more popular days.\nThis album is not as polished.  Lacks the tight team of a group that has been together.  Perhaps their next album will be more mature as the new members of Tate's band find their common rhythm.  As he builds his band back with new blood, we might find ourselves very impressed.  We know he does well when there is a theme.  Operation Mindcrime and American Solder both strong talent albums.;Geoff without Michael
211;156.0;5.0;14.0;The record sounds awesome. It's fresh and new in the absence of  old, stagnant,  static members that don't move or write music.\n\nAlso notice that all the bad reviews are from the same group of people,  the same group of people that can't fight their way out of a paper bag,  so take those with a grain of salt and ignore them.;Great Record
237;157.0;5.0;14.0;"I was expecting something good and instead got something AMAZING! This would have been the perfect followup to Promised Land. Geoff Tate sounds great, the band (including guest spots) is tight and right on. The whole album is an emotional experience.\n\nDare took my breath away as did Life Without You. In the Hands of God..oh the feels! Love the harmony on Everything. I think we all know those who are ""Running Backwards"".  The Weight of the World is beyond amazing. In true Queensryche style, the last song is EPIC. Geoff's stunning voice gives me goosebumps as I listen to The Weight of the World.\n\nNever stop making music Geoff you ARE Queensryche!";Stunning album!
243;158.0;4.0;14.0;"Lineup changes can kill a band. At the very least, they have the potential to radically alter a band's sound. What happens when almost the entire band is replaced? Well, the good news is that Geoff Tate's unmistakable voice is still present here and in fine form. Opting to sing for the vast majority of the time in a commanding mid-range tone, Tate shows why he is often imitated but never duplicated. Combined with passionate lyrics, most here revolving around the subject of human relationships (particularly love and loss), his vocal performance does not leave much to be desired. The other good news is that Frequency Unknown marks a return to a more guitar driven sound that Queensryche, to the dismay of many, moved away from on 2011's Dedicated to Chaos. Beyond that? Well. This is something new. This record covers a very wide spectrum of sound ranging from moments with atmospheric keys and quiet acoustic guitar to full blown, downtuned modern heavy metal behemoths. Within that, there's a lot of previously unexplored territory that creates an almost unrecognizable feeling for the listener at times. However, given that the man responsible for co-writing 82% of the QR catalog is still the man behind the wheel on FU, some familiarity is to be expected. This can be heard most clearly on ""In the Hands of God"" and ""Life Without You"", two songs which recall the sounds of Promised Land and Empire respectively.\n\nSo what's new? Quite a few things. Although QR has always employed the use of keyboards on their records, the addition of keyboardist Randy Gane as an official full-time member to the band adds a significant new texture to the band's music. Of course, it's also impossible to overlook the large roster of guest musicians adding their own flavor to these tunes. Of note, Craig Locicero contributes a number of memorable, headbanging riffs throughout the ten tracks (""Slave"" boasts what may be the heaviest Queensryche riffing ever put to record). There is a downside to this, however. While the multitude of talent present enables each song to have its own distinct identity built upon excellent individual performances, something else inevitably suffers as a result. Frequency Unknown as a whole lacks the cohesiveness that Queensryche fans have come to expect from the band who brought us expertly crafted records such as the conceptual masterpieces Operation Mindcrime and American Soldier. That said, FU is full of great material and earns its place in the band's discography.\n\nIn traditional Queensryche style, the album's final track is a powerful, emotionally charged epic that stands alongside the likes of ""Anybody Listening?"", ""Someone Else?"" and ""The Right Side of My Mind"". ""The Weight of the World"" begins solely with an acoustic guitar and Tate's expressive vocals. After he utters perhaps his final words on a Queensryche record (fittingly ""When I'm gone...what will they remember?""), the song transitions into a moving instrumental section which contains the record's most impressive guitar solo (courtesy of Megadeth's Chris Poland). A perfect blend of shred and soul, the solo leaves a lasting impression and brings it all to an end with nothing left to prove. It is a true musical highlight, and for the single-track-downloading-crowd, the must have download of this album.\n\nFrequency Unknown manages to feel familiar yet fresh - an impressive feat for a band with 30+ year recording history. Fans of Queensryche's entire diverse, ever changing career should certainly be pleased with what Geoff Tate and company have brought to the table this time around - even though it may take a few listens to fully appreciate. Those still longing for days gone by or expecting The Warning ver. 2013 may not want to swap this one into their cassette deck just yet.";So much drama surrounds this album...but the songs are great!
21;159.0;1.0;13.0;One word - PAINFUL!!!!!\n\nThis is just horrible - everything on it - the mix, GT's vocals, the material and especially the guitar playing. But last but not least the BUTCHERING of QR classics. VERY SAD.\n\nDon't waste your money with this cd. Been a fan since the 206 days and calling this a QR release is pathetic!;WOW!!
60;160.0;4.0;13.0;Geoff Tate's voice is unique and can not be replaced. His smooth emotional dramatic inflective vocal delivery can not be matched regardless. This Album has many Gems - Cold, hands of God , life without you, and weight of the world.  For me the remakes just didn't cut it , I would have preferred perhaps something different like acoustic versions, but overall this album is great and highly enjoyable if you enjoy melodic hard rock with a progressive edge - (this is not as hard as operation mindcrime, Rage for order would be closer to its type of sound character ). Highly recommended and an enjoyable listen that gets even better the more you listen to it.;Dont listen  to the critics !!! This Album has many Gems .
64;161.0;1.0;13.0;to describe how awful this is.  Granted, I only listened to the samples on Amazon, but it is just plain awful.  I have been a lifelong Queensryche fan, so its a bit sad to see what has become of this once great band.  Most of the stuff they put out after Q2K was crap. (I actually liked Q2K).\n\nDeGarmo leaving really hurt.  He Wilton were a great pair.  Tate seems to have gone off the rails. The re-records are just plain awful.  There is nothing good about this at all.\n\nCan't wait for the other Queensryche disc.  I've heard Redemption and Where Dreams Go to Die.  Sounds promising.;There are no words
65;162.0;5.0;13.0;Geoff Tate=Queensryche!  Great CD  Love it and loved the fact they stuck in a couple oldies for good measure!  And love the subliminal message!!!;Awesome
81;163.0;1.0;13.0;I was actually hoping for this to be better than Dedicated to Chaos.  Maybe Geoff could do something with his newfound need to prove himself.  But this album is contrived, rushed, and insulting in the way that it panders while seemingly condescending to those it is pandering to.\n\nDon't waste your time or money on this.;Rushed and insulting

108;165.0;5.0;13.0;Geoff Tate has brought Queensryche back with a vengeance.\nThis is one of two Queensryches -(the other has the remaining members and a new singer.)\nthis album is Current,aggressive,melodic and just plain cool!\nif you are a Geoff Tate and Queensryche fan, you have to be impressed with\nthis one!-the QR passion from years ago is back. A Hybrid of the best albums of yore,\nand a new sound with a fresh new vibe and Rocks Hard!.;Fan since their debut in the 80's
120;166.0;4.0;13.0;This is the Queensryche that I remember, Rocking... I enjoy listening to this album over and over.  Good addition to my collection.;----
132;167.0;4.0;13.0;"OK heres how I see it so far. This really so far isent a bad record. Its certanly alot better than the last few but in no way anything like mindcrime or queen of the ryche. you can say whatever you want about tates vocals but its not 1985 its 20+ years later. All the talk about who "" queensryche "" is geoff or his former band mates is irrelivant, the split is devistating but when it comes right down to it I will as well as most people in the end will follow the singer,musicans have always come and gone. when I go to see a show I want to hear the classics we grew up listing to. Gene Simmions once said in an interview when asked about a new kiss album "" people want to here the old stuff at a show ,there not interested in anything new . well I want to hear geoff sing all my old favorites. I cant imagine anyone else singing them. anybody else is a cover band, and the fact that the La Torre version of the band has publicy stated that they only want to play the albums up to empire just proves the point that people are only interested in the old stuff. As I said its not 1985 anymore. Unfortunatly havy metal is only what we remember it to be, and great bands from that era today are gone or struggle to continue . Again I think the split is devising for both tate and his former band mates and will not help them to stay relivant in 2013 whith the rock/metal scean all but gone. look at all the bands from that era who have tried to change front men. How did that work out for them ? ( Motley Crue, La Guns ) and it dident work for them when this music was at its peak. To me,  apart from tate getting his issues resolved with his former band mates and getting back together and putting out a kick ass album the best thing that could happen is them both keeping the name and letting the fans decid who thay want to spend their money on or perhaps both. People should stop getting caught up in all the drama and just listen to the new album without their feelings getting in the way. THE LAST SEVERAL ALBUMS HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE only deserving of lisiting to one time but they were a collective effort lets not forget as everybody keeps saying that geoff tate was not who made up queensryche!!! Geoff has some real talent in the new band and hopefully they as a band can come up with music that will keep old and new fans happy and as I said in the beginning so far this album isent that bad in fact its pretty good!! Just waiting for the new ""free"" remix when it it sent";So far not to bad
202;168.0;5.0;13.0;This has to be my fav cd since promised land.  Their is a solid atmosphere a darkness in a lot of the sounds that rings loud throughout the whole cd.\n\nMy fav tunes are\ncold\nLife Without you\nEverything\n\nall the reviews that say he cant hit notes seem to be way off, they redo jet city woman on here and it is top notch.  I feel you can't replace the voice of Queensryche, Geoff has always had a tone of his own and it is captured perfectly in this cd.\n\nThere are sounds of empire, promised land and even q2k in here.  But the solid cold atmosphere of promised land is captured with heart and tone in this cd.  It is sad to see reviews from people who base it on their personal opinion of someone they have never met.  if you get a chance check this cd out and listen to it, the music and lyrics will grown on you fast.\n\nthis is def not the horrible mess the was dedicated to chaos.;this has such sonic quality
207;169.0;5.0;13.0;After listening to the entire album, I have to say that I am excited by the grouping of songs and the overall sound!  I love all of the Queensryche music over the years, and this is no exception.  I do think the many artists that conglomerated to put this together have made a terrific CD.  Geoff Tate sounds great, as always.  It's no wonder their shows have been selling out and receiving such great reviews.  Keep up the good work, fellas (and lady!) and I look forward to seeing your show in Seattle!  Woo-hoo!;Digging the new sound!
223;170.0;2.0;13.0;Ignoring all the politics I listened to the whole CD online.  First the CD is mixed very bad.  This was known before the release and supposedly they will remix and re-release.  Definitely buy the re-mixed version when it comes out and not this one.  I like 1/3 of the songs alot.  1/3rd of the songs were ok and the other 1/3 were bad and that's the new original songs.  The re-recorded classic songs are just horrible and a waste of everyones time.  If they remix this CD I will buy it then but not as is and will give it a 3 star rating at that time.;2 stars as is or 3 stars remixed
63;171.0;1.0;12.0;no review here. just want to thank the other reviewers for saving me 10 bucks. Tate is a self centered a$$. Can't wait for the real Queensryche in June.;thanks
71;172.0;2.0;12.0;"As my review title states I'm indifferent about Queensryche in any way, shape, or form.  I checked this out because of the strong emotion in the other reviews.  As fairly and objectively as I can state my position:  There are some decent song structures buried on this album but with such a glaring lack of production the cd is almost impossible to negotiate.  If Geoff Tate had put any effort at all into making a high class sound experience I don't think the reviews would be quite so dire.  As it stands, he didn't and they are.  There's no QR to be found here but that's not the fault to me; it's a VERY substandard product from a high profile musician/band.  Queensryche fans should DEFINITELY avoid this one and so should most hard rock/metal fans.";Indifferent about ANY form of Queensryche
72;173.0;4.0;12.0;"This album is taking a beating on every front. I think people forget what is real. This album is raw and that's what I like about it. Yes Queensryche has changed; and that is what is best about this album. Geoff Tate is older and so is his voice. This is about change and growth, without production. To miss this is to miss the best album by Queensryche in years. ""The sound"" of Queensryche is classic and absent in some ways from this CD and that is what people are struggling with. This change needed to happen. Life happens. We change. Something was captured here in whatever form, and that is what Rock is supposed to be about.";What is real?
75;174.0;4.0;12.0;"I'm listening to this album again as I write this and all I can say is...damn GT. This is a really good album. Forget the hate that is going on and just listen to this CD, as well most people should. The song ""Cold"" is a perfect way to start the album off, and Kelly Grey's solo is awesome. This album delivers on many hard rock levels, from in your face (Slave) to an almost MC inspired song (In The Hands of God). And the vocals on ""The Weight of The World"" are almost haunting. Close your eyes during this song and you can imagine what Randy Gane was going through. Geoff sounds great, emoting the lyrics only the way GT can. If you like/love hard rock, then this is an album that you should experience. Do it. I dare you.";A damn good album
78;175.0;5.0;12.0;So many bad reviews for this album, when it does deserve a chance to be listen to. I've never been a fan of Queensryche, the only album I own of theirs is Operation Mindcrime, which I love it. When I heard of the split in the band, I decided to pick up Frequency Unknown and give it a chance. I won't lie the mix really sucked at first, but when Cleopatra Records offer to replace it, I gave it another chance. I am really impress on the songs, specially hearing K.K. Downing in one of the songs. I think this album deserves another chance once you hear it with the improved mix. I am waiting on the release of the other side of Queensryche and see what they have to offer, then we'll see who earns the right of the Queensryche name.;Queensryche vs Queensryche Round 1
79;176.0;1.0;12.0;"""Unknown"" is right. If there was a listenable frequency here, I'm sure someone in Geoff's version of Queensryche would have found it. Sadly, there isn't.\n\nI don't know where to begin.\n\nSome adjectives that come to mind:\n\n1. Tired\n2. Trite\n3. Uninspired\n4. Boring\n5. One dimensional\n6. Shallow\n7. Sophomoric\n8. Ridiculous\n9. Pointless\n10. Embarrassing\n11. Crappy\n\nI could go on, as Geoff Tate seems to. Long past the point of relevance in the music world. His reputation is trashed. His talent is gone. His credibility is shot. Retirement is the only option at this point. Either that, or a personality transplant and a heaping dose of Hey-I-Can-Sing-Again medicine.\n\nThe singing! Wow. The singing is typical Geoff Tate: low- to medium-register, without a great deal of passion or inflection. The lyrics are often cringe-worthy. The musicianship is passable, but hardly essential. I gave this one listen, skipping ahead after a minute or so in each track, unable to bear any more.\n\nFrequency Unknown is a steaming pile and Geoff Tate should have his nose rubbed in it.\n\nBut, hey. Nobody here has to take my word for it. Just read the other 1- and 2-star reviews, which outnumber the 4- and 5-star reviews by two or three to one.\n\nSave your money for the real Queensryche album, by the other Queensryche band, that'll be released soon.";A Steaming Pile
82;177.0;2.0;12.0;"Well i've been living with this album over the weekend and I'm gonna try my best to review it based on the music and not based on the band drama.\n\nAs of right now my take of the songs individually\n\nCold - 8/10 - Really good song I think. Alot of people have criticized the guitar solo as being out of place, but I don't hear that.\n\nDare - 2/10 - Would be a good song without Tate's really out of place vocals. He's out of key in many spots and his ""melody"" conflicts with the riff. This song would be great with a Staley or Cornell type singer.\n\nGive It To You - 3/10 - It's not bad, but not really that great either. The musicianship it really good (which seems to be the case on most of the songs). It's hindered by Tate's lack of enthusiasm.\n\nSlave - 6/10 - I really like this one. The riff is really good. It's very driving. The bridge and chorus is really catchy. He is kind of just going through the motions on the verses though, which is what brought this one down from 8 to 6 for me. The lyrics are clearly about Todd La Torre and his former bandmates, to me anyway and sometimes gets a little to silly (is he saying ""you're their bitch"" in the break???)\n\nIn The Hands of God - 8/10 - This is the first one that even sounds close to sounding like Queensryche (albeit the mid to late 90s version.) I really like it, the main guitar riff it very haunting.\n\nRunning Backwards - 4/10 - Passable. Tate is the weak link on this one (well he really is on the whole album). Again a really good song in the backround with Tate not sure what direction he wants to go and trying to hit notes he can't hit anymore. Throughout the whole song he sounds like hes struggling.\n\nLife Without You - 7/10 - Really good intro. Could also pass as a 90s QR song. Tate's vocals aren't great though on the verses (seeing a trend here?) although I think some of that could of been fixed in post production.\n\nEverything - 8/10 - I really like the guitar riff on this one. In fact it's kind of interesting how he took a heavy riff like that and gave it more of a ballady vibe. This song is really good, Tate sounds like he cares a little bit.\n\nFallen - 6/10 - Pretty good. Tate seems to be doing on these slower songs. Closer to being a Queensryche song. A little generic though, nothing really sticks out to me and hits me in the head.\n\nThe Weight of The World - 9/10 - This must be the song they put all of their focus on. It's a good closer (if you don't count the rerecordings of course.....). Pretty epic buildup.\n\nMathematically it puts it at an overall 6/10 however as an overall album i'd rank it 4/10. I'd likely only revist half of the songs on this album in the future. Some really good songs, but it doesn't flow well together as an album.\n\nAdditional points -\n\nThis album was bogged down with Tate trying to be something he wasn't. He's said in the past hes not much of a metal guy and it shows here. Tate could really thrive if he attempted to make 70s prog rock ala Peter Gabriel. The most contrived portions of this album are the parts where he attempts to be metal or grunge. The songs he did very well on were the slower songs.\n\nTate also needs to find a producer that isn't afraid of hurting his feelings and telling him he's doing a terrible job. A song like Dare or Give It To You should of even left the studio cut with those vocals. He seems to be good with choruses and bridges. Had he took a little more time to trim the fat he could of ended up with a good Geoff Tate solo album, but as it stands he released a rushed work that doesn't even sound like Queensryche.\n\nThe rerecordings -\nTate said in an interview he did the rerecordings for money and it REALLY SHOWS!!!!! The instruments sound like they were recorded with Line 6 equipment. The bass is thin and the drums aren't remarkable in any way. The backing vocals on Empire were laughable. The other 3 were okay, but they made great songs and turned them into average garage band act type songs.\n\nSo there you have it, a below average album with a few average songs.";A below average album with a few average songs.
122;178.0;3.0;12.0;I like this album better than some of the more recent qr stuff. It holds my interest throughout. It looks like tate's old band mates rallied the troupes to dump on the album. Most of the one star reviewers are first time critics. Curious. Just saying. It will be fun to see what the other faction put out soon.;Keeps my interest
127;179.0;4.0;12.0;Let me start by saying I don't think Geoff should have recorded this as a Queensryche album, maybe as Queensryche featuring Geoff Tate. I guess that is up to a court to decide. If he is awarded the name I will probably still listen. I liked Judas Priest with Ripper Owens, Motley Crue with John Corabi ( still believe their best record ever ), Poison without C.C. Deville, Van Halen with Gary Cherone, and many other band changes. Definitely looking forward to the Todd LaTorre fronted Queensryche album. With all that out of the way let's get to the point. Frequency Unknown continues the direction Geoff was taking QR for the last several albums. While not liking everything about all of them, I always liked parts of them. I like this release. The mix could use some work, but it has some good material on it. I won't go into a song by song breakdown, but I like most of them. I don't like Dare, just something about it grates on me. The re-records are shaky . Deadline always seems to want re-records on their albums. Try listening to the album from the point of view as a new listener, it's pretty good. I took a star for the mix. Geoff doesn't sound like he did twenty years ago, very few singers do. Overall I do like this album. Also looking forward to June for the next album from Queensryche. I do believe they deserve the name because they have 3 of the original members. Geoff should just remain solo or start a new band. These are just my opinions, but give the music an unbiased try, you might just like it. Recommended.;Just Listen Like It Is An Unknown Band
129;180.0;4.0;12.0;"How you view this record depends on if you listen with an open mind. If you do, there is much to enjoy and there are some solid songs on there. The players also sound as though they're having fun with the tracks. But, as many have noted, on the original mix, the production (ghastly and muted kick drums, bizarre editing (especially vocally), very muddy instrument sounds and poor balances in the mix) greatly impair what is otherwise a mostly enjoyable straightforward heavy rock album. The remix features Tate's vocals front and center, where they belong and a much brighter sound overall, which fixes almost all of the problems of the original mix. There are some duds and odd moments still, but those are the distinct minority. Speaking of vocals, Tate's voice is far from being the mess its portrayed as and carries his trademark command and conviction and distinctive tonality. He remains a very gifted singer, still.\n\nIf you go into this looking for a return to the halcyon ""glory"" days of Empire and the preceding discs, forget it. Neither version of Queensryche has that kind of recording budget anymore (not to mention Michael Kamen being dead and Chris DeGarmo out of the band) and even when they were a kinda functioning band, they didn't on the last few discs. Forget the lush layering and QR trying to be the second coming of Pink Floyd. What we're going to keep getting is a stripped down sound as Tate puts forth his vision of what QR means (and there are plenty of quintessential QR moments on this disc that reference a lot of their 90's work) vs. that of the remnant side fighting over the QR name.\n\nAs those covers...simply a mistake. They range in quality a bit, at worst, they sound like something from a relatively decent bar band. At best, they're wholly unnecessary. Tate's voice sounds a lot like Harrison's Ford during the voiceover for Blade Runner, bland, bored and mostly lifeless, clearly pressed into something neither wanted to do.\n\nYou definitely want to make sure you get the remix, though and not the original. Cleopatra will send you a free disc of the remix on request if you email them a photo or scan of the sales receipt. You want to do this.";A surprisingly strong record
199;181.0;5.0;12.0;I love the new sound.  This is such a extraordinary sound.  I love all Geoffs work and this is no different.  He has a voice and sound that no one can ever come close to. LOVE IT...;Soon much better than ever before
214;182.0;4.0;12.0;CD is solid! Geoff was wise leaving the mediocre bass play and drummer from the past band. Anyone remember Chris DeGarmo the real lead guitarist?

49;183.0;1.0;11.0;This is a disgrace.  Hopefully after the court date later in the year, this album will be stripped of the name Queensryche.  Not one tolerable song on this mess.

I can't wait to hear the REAL Queensryche later this month.  It's been a long time since there was a good Queensryche album, but hopefully that will be remedied soon.  I just wish they could get DeGarmo back too.;One of the worst albums I have ever heard!
54;184.0;2.0;11.0;Beyond the childish cover, it's certainly better than that horrible thing he put out under the QR name last time (Dedicated To Chaos), but from what I have heard with my own ears, it is nowhere close to the new QR coming out soon. This one just puts me to sleep and loses my interest after 3 min (much like his sub-par solo effort Kings & Thieves). Sorry Geoff - drop the QR name and put out your mediocre and predictable stuff under your own name where it belongs.

154;186.0;3.0;11.0;"Not going to go into a whole lot of detail here on why I liked this album, because my main purpose is to just add a little balance to the extremely negative reviews.\n\nI don't read websites and follow every move a band makes. Even though I have been listening to Queensryche and loving them since their EP came out in the early '80s, I wasn't aware of their recent troubles until just about a month ago. Who cares? The music is what matters to me.\n\nIt's far from the best thing they have done, but man, how can you slam this album so badly, considering that they have been going downhill since Q2K? Dedicated to Chaos was a step up, but only about half the songs were good. Not everything here is great, but there is some decent stuff here. It's not the disaster the other reviewers are making it out to be.\n\nLots of albums had problems during production. Lots of bands in the past have changed members. Actually, the 'Ryche has a pretty good track record compared to many bands. Lots of albums have been rushed, and lots of band members have been attacked by their supposed fans for various things they've done and said. None of that matters. If you don't like the music, fine. But these things I just mentioned do not necessarily make a bad album. Obviously some people just don't want things to change. Too bad, it's inevitable.\n\nI didn't care much for the re-records myself, but mainly because it just seems pointless to re-do a song without significantly altering it musically. Like when Disturbed recently covered ""Living After Midnight"". I could barely tell the difference from the original. What's the point?\n\nI liked this album. No, it is no Mindcrime or Rage, but man, it is so much better than that Tribe album.";Wow, It's Really Not All That Bad
169;187.0;3.0;11.0;I just saw Geoff's Queensryche last week, what a joke & the re recorded tunes on this cd make me laugh even more, as for the new tunes weak and lame. Mix those vocals further back in the mix, next time.;lame

201;189.0;5.0;11.0;"Queensryche returns with the epic, brilliant, and astonishing return to form 'Frequency Unknown'. From the opening track 'Cold', to the unbelievably brilliant and epic closeer 'Weight of the World', Queensryche led by founding member Geoff Tate, has created a musical masterpiece unparalleled in recent history. Back in 2012, Goeff Tate fired several band members who had not contributed to the band in years and formed a new version of Queensryche which has surpassed even the former glory years. Listening to incredible and ambitious songs like 'In the Hands of God', and 'Fallen' will truly move anyone and made me realize that Queensryche has been and will always be about Geoff Tate.\n\nThe album includes intense and memorable performances by a who's-who of hard rock all-stars like Chris Poland (Megadeth), Ty Tabor (Kings X), KK Downing (Judas Priest) and many others who helped Geoff create a true work of art, a modern masterpiece of musical genius. Along with the glorious return of Queensryche guitarist Kelly Gray and top producer/writer Jason Slater the new and only true version of Queensryche has proven they are an unstoppable force of sonic power and melodic spirit. Every song is meticulously crafted and arranged in a manner that elicits a strong emotional reaction from the listener and makes me think this album may possibly be spoken in the same light as classic Queensryche records.\n\nThere are several negative reviews on Amazon; ignore them. 'Frequency Unknown' is simply one of the most audacious, commanding, and downright stunning hard rock records ever written.

242;190.0;4.0;11.0;Honestly, after being a long time QR fan I was a little apprehensive okay ALOT apprehensive after hearing all the negative reviews... but honestly that's part of the magnetism to this album as well.  After reading all the hate, and hearing for myself this album is no compromise to the queensryche name!!;No publicity is bad publicity
16;191.0;1.0;10.0;If I could give this 0 stars I would. It's the same tired drivel, spoken word garbage that his holy vest has put out since om2 and to a lesser extent before that, tribe, hitnf and q2k. it just got painfully worse when om2 came along with his team of degenerate outside writers and producers. The only song I can even remotely listen to is cold without wanting to vomit. Want to hear a real qr release that sounds like hard rock/metal, pick up the self-titled release by the real QR, not this vest solo garbage with guest guitar solos thrown in that don't fit the wine soaked bloated vocals and oven mitts and slaters production. Worst production I've ever heard.\n\nLounges need lizards Geoff, goodbye.\n\nEdit: yeah, FU still sucks a week later.;Just go away G dawg
24;192.0;5.0;10.0;I have been hearing a lot of bad things about Geoff Tate and Queensryche lately so I was a little apprehensive when I decided to purchase it.  I don't know if the rumors are true but this album was worth the cash I have bought all of this band's albums good, bad and solo and I really liked this one.  The new material is great not too crazy about the old songs on there but I'm glad their there.  All in all rumors or not I loved this album not as good as operation mindcrime but I love the new songs just the same.;Right Frequency
28;193.0;1.0;10.0;"I'm from Seattle and met Taint a half a dozen times.  Each one of those times, he was a complete a** to me.  The rest of QR (Wilton, Jackson and Rockenfield) were such nice guys.  Willing to chat with fans and sign stuff.  Geoff Taint said F.U. To me at a signing in Tacoma at Tower records in 1986.  So it was really no surprise when news broke of his knife wielding, punching and shoving and spitting (what is he 12 ?) rampage.  Since I side with everyone in QR but Taint due to his asinine behavior, and how I saw him treat fans the past 29 years I opted out on throwing down my money on this rushed ""Tainted Geoff Tate"" disaster album.  I listened to a friends copy and it was horrid.  What is sad is that he has some amazing musicians behind him on this project.  But the second he starts singing it ruins the song.  I give the album as a whole 1 star.  The song ""Cold"" the best track on F.U. (But still a pile of dog crap) I give 2 stars.  Save your money.  The real Queensryche just released an amazing new record with a new epic and outstanding (and friendly, and sane) vocalist Todd La Torre.  By reading the plethora of negative reviews, its quite clear Geoff Taint's career went totally down the crapper.  And he had the audacity to tell the Rocklahoma crowd they ""sucked"" ?  No, this lame and incorrectly titled band name album sucks !!!  Very disappointed that he would pull this weak move on the fans.  Do not support fake Ryche !!!!! The Warning -  Stay away from Frequency Unknown.";Piece of garbage
36;194.0;4.0;10.0;"Let me preface this review by saying i was worried this record was going to be pretty horrible based on tates  second Solo album that left me wondering if he went completely off the deep end. Thankfully my fears were put aside  with this latest output of his version of Queensryche. Not only is it a dramatic improvement from recent records i would go so far to say its the best QR record since Operation mindcrime 2.  It showcases quite a varied sound from the alt rock ""give it to you"" that showcases a much welcomed alice in chains influence to the promise land style ""In the hands of god"" to the very heavy almost thrash riffing of ""slave""\n\n I would have gave this album five stars if if were not for the rerecording of the classic ryche era tunes. these in particular remind one of how much geoff voice has aged over the years and it would have been better if these were not added to the cd. Further for those who are big into the  a bands lyrics some of the tracks may leave something to be desired\n\n Overall its an excellent record with a few flaws.";Surprisingly good
93;195.0;5.0;10.0;Great cd for being done in only two months totally awesome!  Brad gillis rudy sarzo dave meniketti simon wright kk dowing geoff tates new queensryche is amazing!!!!!!\n\nIf you don't like it your not a real fan go back to listening to madonna.;Awrsome!
94;196.0;5.0;10.0;Geoff Tate has still got it and some can't handle it.  Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.  The king is back.;Haters gonna hate...
113;197.0;4.0;10.0;I have read many many reviews of this album and I'm blown away by opinions that have to do with the drama of the band, not this actual product. I have not taken any side on the drama surrounding Queensryche so that hasn't blinded me or given me a preconceived notion with this album.\n\nThis is a very good album from Queensryche. Honestly it's the best since DeGarmo left (Hear in the Now Frontier). The guest guitarists have certainly held their own here! Great guitar work and solid tracks in Cold, Dare, Slave, In the Hands of God, Running Backwards, Life Without You, Everything, and Fallen. The weaker track is Give it to You and all of the re recordings miss the mark. Weight of the World is the typical haunting Geoff Tate ballad that comes with almost every record he has recorded, and is solid. The re-recordings on this album should have never been put on here as they in fact do miss the energy and instrumental tones that made the what they are.\n\nI'll touch on some tracks here:\n-Cold is a great kick off track with a killer guitar riff and solid vocals! I do feel that the vocals are a bit low in the mix, but other than that and slight precision issue at the ending of the song (guitar and drums not being perfectly together), it is a cool tune.\n-Dare has a couple really cool guitar riffs, and has a catchy hook mixed with a solid vocal performance.\n-In the Hands of God is a very good song! Tate puts real passion and emotion in his vocal tone on this one. Also the guitar solo at the end blends well (not done much before in QR albums) as it is interlaced with the vocal lines. This song is a highlight!\n-Running Backwards is another strong track.\n-Everything reminds me a bit of early Evanescence. The programmed drum loop(s) are a really cool addition to a QR album. This song is very crunchy as well.\n-Life without you is such a great slow track! The drums are top notch and add so much color to the song. Very good tune!\n-Fallen has a really cool hook in the melodic lines, the guitar work is exceptional.\n\nWith all of the people here obviously allowing the drama of the band influence them, it is very unfair to say some of the things I've seen here like Tate is flat (he has one questionable note in the rerecording of Silent Lucidity), you can obviously hear that this is a rushed job, a bad mix, etc. These statements are simply not fair and untrue. I am giving this album 4 stars because the endings of a couple of the tracks weren't as polished as they could have been, and the sub par re-recordings of older tracks. However this is the best group of Queensryche songs in many many years. I can't blame Geoff Tate for trying to keep the name of the band that he spent the majority of his entire adult life creating art with. It is unfortunate that these circumstances have come upon us but I'm glad the situation inspired Tate to create a heavy album and it also gave him motivation and passion in the lyric content as this is the best he's done in a long time.  Finally, I am looking forward to the other version of the band's album to come out in June. I guess we're lucky to have two albums coming out from what was once my favorite band of all time.;Don't Let the bad Reviews Get in the Way of a Very Good Album
12;198.0;1.0;8.0;Well, we all get older I guess. Some of us just know when to retire and some don't. I get it that years of singing metal at the top of your range will damage your voice.

22;200.0;5.0;9.0;"I have been a Queensryche fan (possibly my favorite American hard rock act) for nearly thirty years and all I care about is the music. I think all of their CDs are excellent with the exception of Dedicated to Chaos and this disc is a solid return to form, original, entertaining and multi-layered. The music is all that matters and I love this disc. That is it. No politics or favorites but I think it sounds more like ""Queensryche "" whatever that is for a band that changed its sound nearly every album, than the offering from Scott, Whip and Eddie. That is my two cents.";Let's focus on the music
23;201.0;5.0;9.0;The Weight of the World is awesome. It's almost like Is There Anyone Listening. The CD is a gem for any Queensryche fan. Also, grab the Queensryche (2013) CD. The band is back to their roots and their original sound. And, Tate's voice is back too, with the deep and high pitched tones found on their first 4 albums!;Another good Queensyrche must have CD!
25;202.0;1.0;9.0;I keep expecting something decent from this guy, but it's all boring crap.  If you're looking for a great album, listen to the REAL Queensryche (with Todd De La Torre), that sounds like Classic Queensryche. This is awful, it sounds like he threw this together in a month. Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!! Awful!!!!

It's all a bunch of amateurish strumming, repetitive choruses, and whining.\n\nThis is not the Queensrych we've all heard up to Tribe.\n\nTo further demonstrate Tates megalomania, this album contains rerecorded versions of classic Queensryche tracks; horribly done.  They're terrible.\n\nSkip this album.  Lets see what Todd La Torre's album is like.";Terrible terrible terrible
45;204.0;1.0;9.0;now I have been listening to queensryche since I was in diapers so I know the standards and the pedigree that the name lives up to but it seems after promised land the passion for the music slowly started to fade then Geoff tate was fired from the band and decided to form his version of queensryche: frequency unknown is the first album, which at this point lets face it is a solo album with the queensryche name on it. i have followed queensryche through the years i listen to all older albums on a weekly basis but frequency unknown is literally the poorest example for exceptional music. i first heard the samples on youtube and iTunes and immediately knew this was going to be a flop. Geoff tate threw this album together in a matter of just a few months and you will notice that when you listen to the songs. its sounds rushed and uninspired, the vocals are horrible, the instrumentals repetitive, and mother of god who wrote these songs? the singing is straight forward and lazy there is no attempt at reestablishing the influence of his former glory. all around this album just flat out sucks a major disappointment i would not recommend any of Geoff tate's recent work either: kings and thieves, dedicated to chaos and so on.;geoff im not mad....just disappointed...again

57;206.0;5.0;9.0;Great job by Tate, blows away anything I heard coming out of his old band mates with the other guy. The other guy needs to find a sound of his own and stop trying to sound like Tate because it isn't working.;no contest!!!
73;207.0;4.0;9.0;The first release of the Tate Queensryche band made up from former members of hardrock/metal bands of the past. This Cd is pretty good but not great,has a great sounding rhythm section,a few guest guitarists etc.and of course Geoff. Tates vocals which completes the package. Very hardrockish sound but not in the Queensryche sound,good release for Geoff so far!;Queens tate
83;208.0;2.0;9.0;'Frequency Unknown' is encrypted code for F.U. to fans for being a sucker enough to purchase this CD. In a rock reality universe this should be the final death knell for both versions of the group for once what was a mighty band. If your waiting for the other Ryche-Light edition of the group with Tate-clone La Torre, it's not any better IMO. From what I know this album was slapped together in a few months(along with the band), written primarily by Tate and Jason Slater. The Ryche has been on life support to me since 'Promised Land' as you can't redeem what you don't have. Tate doesn't have the range anymore to sing much of their earlier material and their albums of the last 15 years + are mediocre at best in terms of writing content IMO. Of course the reason for the 'RUSH' job on this album is for Queensryche name recognition, before Tate has to 'legally' rename his (solo) band on the upcoming Has-beens of Rock tour with Jack Russel's Great White. R.I.P.;Has-beens of Rock tour lined up this Summer?
112;209.0;4.0;9.0;this is the best thing Geoff has put out in a long time, way better than his last solo album or the 2 queensryche albums before that;Vast improvement
115;210.0;4.0;9.0;"After reading mostly negative reviews, I thought I'd take the gamble and buy this CD anyway. I expected it to be really bad and along the lines of ""Dedicated to Chaos"" or ""American Soldier"" which were two of my least favorites from the band. This was actually better than I had expected. I believe with the release of the new ""remix"" of this CD, it will be even better and receive better reviews. The sound quality wasn't the best and Geoff's vocals are drowned out at times. The new track ""Cold"" sounded kind of tinny and probably one of the tracks with the poorest quality. It was great to hear them do a power ballad ""Weight of the World"" that was worth listening to. It's probably one of their best ballads in 20 + years.\nI'd say to those who aren't sure on buying this, wait for the 'remixed' version that is supposed to come out in June.";Better than expected after reading reviews except....
17;211.0;2.0;8.0;As a Geoff Tate solo album...eh, its not that bad. As a Queensryche album, this is bland, mediocre, forced, {and judging from the production} rushed. If you're just a die hard Geoff Tate fan, you may like this album...but if its Queensryche you're looking for, this is not it.;A decent Geoff Tate solo album, a HORRIBLE Queensryche album!
20;212.0;5.0;8.0;Great album. Geoff Tate is Queensryche period. number one rule you DONT replace the icon in the band. you replace the drummer and the bassist. Geoff get Chris back playing with you.;GT Rules
34;213.0;1.0;8.0;"I usually like to give a CD a couple of listens before I make up my mind on it, but this album is honestly bad.  Please listen to the tracks before making the purchase, this really is NOT worth your money.  Even the re-released tracks suffer horribly compared to the originals.  Tate even commented on the re-released tracks saying that he put them on the CD as a way to make money.  REALLY Geoff?!?  I know we shouldn't compare the two ""Queensryches"" but the original guys, minus Geoff, have really put a great line-up together and their new CD puts this one to shame.";This is VERY hard to listen to a second time
39;214.0;1.0;8.0;"There are only a few cds in my hard rock & metal collection that are simply unlistenable. (I even like ""Cold Lake"" by Celtic Frost, as I think that the songs are solid, and could be rerecorded as metal instead of sleaze.) So I'm an open-minded music fan, and I do listen carefully - not only to songwriting, but also to production and musicianship.\n\nLet's break this cd down...\nsongwriting\n  1/5 - most songs just sound unfinished.\n\nproduction and mix\n  0/5 - if I could give negative scores here, I would. I haven't heard the remix, though.\n\nmusicianship\n  2/5 - I like Craig's rhythym guitar, and some solos are cool. It was rushed, though.\n\nvocals\n  0/5 - Geoff Tate hits a lot of flat notes, especially on the 4 ""bonus"" cover tunes.\n\nlyrics and themes\n  1/5 - usually I don't care about this. My usual ambivalence is however impossible here after listening to Geoff's thinly veiled lyrical barbs at his ""enemies"".\n\nNow... how about some other relevant factors outside of the music itself?\n\nhonesty/integrity of this cd\n  0/5 - this is really a scam. The 4 ""bonus"" (or is that ""bogus"") cover tunes are a crime, and Geoff Tate doesn't like metal.\n\npackaging/presentation\n  0/5 - this should not have the Queensryche name on it - it's a Geoff Tate solo work. And I hate the name! We all know what FU means, Geoff. Maybe ""Final Undoing""...\n\nband goodwill (ie: any positive aura for this cd)\n  0/5 - there is no band here.  This is a session patch-up job. Remember the Iommi solo album with the silver cover and all those singers? It wasn't that good either, was it? But at least Tony was honest about what he was releasing.\n\nFINAL VERDICT - lowest score possible. Completely unlistenable as it was released. Avoid like the plague.";Abysmal and Horrid
41;215.0;1.0;8.0;Somewhere in the lawsuit about the band's name issue Geof Tate loose his path... This album is awful, forget if it should be called a Queensryche album because this is the less important thing about it.\nThis album is just an unfortunate mix of everything but talent.;As Bad As It Could Be.....
53;216.0;4.0;8.0;In the era of dual and dueling queensryche's  this is a pretty solid effort . Sure it could be a Geoff Tate solo recording with guests but it seems consistent with the direction Queensryche had been going  as where the other ryche seem to be trying to sound like they did back in the 80's;solid effort
84;217.0;4.0;8.0;"Just a quick look at the album cover tells you volumes about Geoff Tate's frame of mind. I mean, for pete's sake, if you're going to make such a jab as calling an album (F)requency (U)known, the least you could do is have the sense to have a song titled that on the album. At least then someone out there would think you had a sense of subtlety. If not for the F and U rings, I think this would have been an awesome cover. I also have to say that I was a bit dismayed to see (at least on my Rhapsody list) copies of four Queensryche classics that Geoff Tate bluntly states were ""rerecorded for money"". While the man is widely considered an intellectual, one would think that he would have enough sense to rephrase this in a less crass manner, something like acquising to the record companies wishes to show the strong link to the Queensryche of the past. As far as copies go, they are not bad, but I would have fought to keep them off the disk. Based on his actions, Geoff Tate has forgotten (or never has known) that there is a direct relationship with your PR efforts and record sales. While the remaining members of Queensryche have taken the high ground and have kept their mouth's shut, Tate continues putting his foot in his mouth and has done damage to the Queensryche brand. It would not surprise me in the least if the courts decide that he will have no right to the Queensryche name in the future.\n\nThat being said, I always listen to the music and tune out everything else. I'm certainly not going to come out and classify myself as a music expert (although I've been following it for more than 40 years and have worked as a professional musician) but I consider music is art. And as the saying goes, I may not know art, but I know what I like. And I like Frequency Unknown. In fact, I like it a lot.\n\nA lot of people say that Tate should have released this record as a solo album. While his claim to the Queensryche name is somewhat weak, several songs on this album are dead set firm in the Queensryche legacy. You could drop ""In the hands of God"" right into Promised Land with no loss of continuity and ""Life without you"" onto Empire and ""Running backwards"" onto Mindcrime as well. ""Cold"", the initial single is all Queensryche and drips with the commerciality of the Mindcrime hits. For the first time, Tate (and his main collaborator) and Kelly Slater have really channeled the classic Queensryche sound.\n\nI hear some other influences creeping into this album as well. The brilliant ""Dare"" seems to borrow just a little bit from Seattle brethren Alice in Chains. ""Slave"" emits a strong GnR/Velvet Revolver flavor. And the nu-metal groove of ""Everything"" is a song so strong that I get it into my head and can't get it out.\n\nIf you are a guitar junkie, there is lots of cool leads and licks. ""Give it to you"" features some very cool slow lead work, and the double time lead of ""Cold"" is so damn cool. And the acoustic Floydish melancholia of the closer ""The weight of the world"" makes it the perfect, and I mean perfect, album closer. I would have liked this album even more if it had ended right there in lieu of the commercial remakes.\n\nI encourage you to listen to this with an open mind. If you have it set in your mind that you're going to hate it, most likely you will. It's human nature.\n\nBottom line, if you want to hate Geoff Tate (and I'm certainly not going to tell you that you shouldn't), I understand. If you're so much a hater that you want to hate me, I can live with that. But don't hate the music. It's too good.\n\nYou can read my other reviews (and reviews from other people) and write your own reviews on epinionatedmusic.com";An epinionated review

I feel insulted after having listened to this.\n\nThe real QR just released an album, everyone listen to that if you want to be impressed.\nThis Geoff Tate rush-job was just a quick attempt to keep the QR name for himself (which he will ultimately legally fail to do). This album sounds terrible on every level: production, mixing, songwriting... including Tate's voice, with which he can no longer stay in key.\nI used to like the guy, but he needs to stop trying to ""be"" Queensryche... his voice is almost completely gone... he can maybe get a gig as a lounge singer in Vegas, but he is the voice of Queensryche no more.";Almost unbelievably bad
18;219.0;3.0;7.0;"Let me start by saying that I'm a long time Queensryche fan. Been a fan since Operation: Mindcrime was new. That being said, this album left me kind of disappointed. Despite a who's who of rock and metal musicians around him, Geoff Tate just couldn't find the sound or feel of Queensryche that the fans have come to know and love. I tried to give it a fair shake by listening to it back to back with the Queensryche (2013) album and it comes up a bit short. The reworking of the classics left me asking ""Why?"" and the rest of the album is just kind of ok. By comparison, the other version of Queensryche with Todd La Torre on vocals hit on that almost Maiden-esque sound that made us fall in love with the band in the 80s. Frequency Unknown is not bad for filling out the catalog but I would not set your expectations very high for this record. I recommend that long time fans buy both and compare them for yourselves like I did. I will still listen to both as there are decent songs on each album but overall, I expect that I'll have the La Torre version of Queensrych in 2013 playing more often.";Frequency Unknown vs. Queensryche (2013)
40;220.0;4.0;7.0;This album is getting a lot of negative reviews and it shouldn't be.  Jeoff Tate sounds better than he has in years and the songs in this collection are really good.  It makes you wonder if this Queensryche split should have happened a long time ago.  The best way for me to describe this album is that the first 30 - 40 minutes are like being alone with your high school girlfriend for the first time.  Then after 30 - 40 minutes pass, her dad (Jeoff Tate) comes in to the room to ruin the affair singing rerecorded versions of old classics songs you love.  I tried to let this slide, I even went as far as to remove the re-recordings from my playlist.  I can't believe Jeoff Tate did this to an otherwise very solid collection of music.;This deserves a listen!
51;221.0;4.0;7.0;"Empire & Promise Land are my favorite QR cd's.  I like this cd and recommend it.  I have the 2 cd version with both mixes.  I prefer the original mix over the Billy Sherwood ix.  I struggle with bands that hire ""sound-a-like"" singers.  Kansas and John Elefante being the exception because he did justice to the Steve Walsh songs and brought his own style.  Geoff Tate created his style so it's hard for me to get past the lack of originality (same with Foreigner, Journey, etc...)  There are 3 sides to every story and many singers are difficult, but I like singers with their own style.  Sad when people bash Geoff Tate and make personal comments.  How about just commenting whether you like the music or not without the personal attacks.  Again, I like this cd and recommend it.";Good cd, solid effort
56;222.0;4.0;7.0;"Its easy to bash a record made during a transition time for any band. While I've read a lot of negative reviews of Frequency Unknown, I do have to say that I have been impressed with both the writing of the music on the album and that the music maintains a Queensryche sound. Tracks like ""Cold"", ""Dare"", and ""Slave"" are very typical of early to mid 2000's Queensryche sounds and ""In the Hands of God"" could be a track off of Promise land. The bands music has not sounded like the music of the mid-1980's for several years and while I loved those tunes, I have also appreciated the progression of the Queensryche sound. Yes, the recording quality could be better on Frequency Unknown, but my hope is that the Queensryche label stays with Goeff Tate and there are many future albums to come. The idea of a band named Queensryche without Tate's unmistakable vocals is ridiculous. Count me out. I'm not interested in hearing a sound-a-like attempting to replicate the original. I think we have all had enough of that with Journey...";Frequency Unknown
89;223.0;4.0;7.0;3.5 stars would be accurate but I gave it 4 to balance. I think there is a lot of emotion involved in most of the poor reviews casting that aside though this some of the best music Geoff has been apart of in a long time. His voice sounds in fine form and full of energy doing what he does best instead of the experimentation on the 'Chaos' record which I did not get. On the negative side the remakes are not an improvement to the originals and honestly other than a business decision I do not see the reason for them.\n\nTake it for what it is and listen without pre-judgement and you may find many of the things that you love about the band originally.;Better than Expected
95;224.0;3.0;7.0;"I haven't purchased the last several QR albums (or GT's latest solo album), but I thought I'd check this out. I was hoping to hear an inspired performance, with well written and recorded songs - you know, GT really giving the F.U. to his former band mates. The first track was promising, and there are a couple of other interesting tunes throughout the record, but overall it's pretty average. The most glaring issue is the mix - it sounds pretty horrible. I understand that a new, remixed version will be available. The second issue I have is with the re-recordings of 4 classic QR tunes. Again, I was hoping to hear a re-imagining of these songs, especially since it's just GT and one other musician performing all the other instruments. Musically, they are essentially duplicates of the originals - same arrangements, sames melodies, same harmonies, same solos, etc. The major differences are the drums - they sound like thy were performed on a drum machine - and the vocals - GT has a really hard time staying in key throughout the songs, especially on any of the higher register vocal parts.\n\nAnyways, not horrible, but also not great. Looking forward to what the ""real"" QR comes out with in a few months.";Average

19;230.0;3.0;6.0;I have changed my mind on this -- I thought this was good, but the other Queensryche X2 album sounds more like the better queensryche albums like Operation Mindcrime and Empire.\nThe production is not very good -- not enough treble..sounds muddy.;Not all bad (added leter: not all tha good either)
29;231.0;3.0;6.0;I actually thought this wasn't that bad at all considering the issues going on right now. Songs like Cold, Dare, Slave, and In The Hands of God are good songs and show that Geoff has the ability to put a good solo band together. The problem here Geoff is that this is really a GOOD Geoff Tate solo album but NOT a Queensryche album at all... There are NONE of the sounds or musicianship or even lyrics that so many associate with Queensryche. FU will go down in flames both in court and in public opinion of who should have the rights to the band name. The remakes of classic Queensryche songs are listenable but a far cry from the originals and should have been left off. This mix of the album itself is a real head scratcher considering we live with 21st century recording technology. All the flaws aside this album is an enjoyable listen and I hope next time Geoff will put more effort into a better mix and being the best Geoff Tate that he can be. He is such an amazing musician and has a one of a kind fingerprint voice. People he isn't 25 anymore. Those days are over but the original voice of Queensryche is still with us and I wish him continued success!;Take this for what it really is......
30;232.0;1.0;6.0;What's amazing is you have a record that if you combined all of the record sales from all of the individual players on all of the records they have been on it would be over 200 million records sold. So what do they give us? UTTER TRASH. I mean this thing will never get played again and sit on a shelf staring at me like the last 4 QR efforts. Tate has just done his best to trash this once insanely great band name.\n\nGame Over.;Really Bad
31;233.0;1.0;6.0;"I'll try to make it more factual and less opinionated, though ""garbage"" is a good off-the-cuff descriptor.\n\n1. Geoff Tate has trouble singing.  Can't meet his previous range, and his voice sounds very much nasal.\n\n2. Second guitar can barely be heard.  Their traditional tone structure worked on two strong guitars panned left and right respectively.  It sounds like they want to keep the same structure, but one of the guitars is set at a low volume, with a dirty overdrive tone Vs. the other, loud and crisp distortion.\n\n3. Overall mixdown is deplorable.  The whole thing sounds amateurish. On top of the guitar duo that is not really a duo, the vocals are either not separated enough or too much on top of everything else (like singing karaoke).  I have produced songs for local bands, and I could have done ""oh god a so much better job"" than whoever they had on console.\n\n4. The bonus, re-recorded hits sound pretty bad because of 1, 2 & 3.\n\nI saw Queensrche live in Baltimore when they were promoting their Operation Mindcrime II album, and they were very good.  This album sounds nothing like the band that I saw live.  Even Q2K was better, and that is saying a lot...";Worst CD Purchase Ever
32;234.0;1.0;6.0;"But with the name Queensyrche on it and the horrible FU title, I have to rate this a 1. I waited until the original members put their album out to see who really respected the sound of Queensyche and the long-suffering fans. It should be obvious to all fans that Geoff was the problem with the band. After years of slamming heavy metal and considering himself above it, Geoff took the cynical approach and attempted a return to the form, with a bunch of B-list hired guns. Unfortunately, he failed. There are some glimmers of hope but he just can't seem to put a fully developed song together. If you like Geoff Tate, the solo artist, you should like this album. And you can continue to like his music as a solo artist as I can't see him winning the rights to the Queensryche name after this album; especially when compared to the quality product the remaining members of Queensryche put out. If you like the classic Queensryche, you should really skip this and get the self titled album from the ""real"" Queensryche.";Not a bad Tate solo album...
38;235.0;4.0;6.0;"Queensryche - Frequency Unknown\nWritten by The Rock Man\n\nIf you were to have a conversation about the musical exports to come out of Seattle, Washington, most, if not everyone, would tell you about the Grunge Movement that rose to fame from there in the 1990s, bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees all called Seattle home. The metal world is also represented with Metal Church flying the flag for Seattle, but long before any of these bands there was Queensryche.\n\nIf you want to talk about living legends who have stood the test of time and taken all before them, you simply can't go past ""The Ryche"". Formed in 1982 Queensryche have delivered some of the most impressive metal albums of all time, including Rage For Order, Empire, Promised Land, Hear In The Now Frontier and their crowning glory, the much loved Operation Mindcrime. In 2013 Queensryche return with a brand new collection of songs on Frequency Unknown.\n\nFrequency Unknown is the band's first studio album since 2011's much maligned Dedicated To Chaos. However, this is were things start to get tricky. This Queensryche is not the original line up. This version has been put together by original lead singer Geoff Tate, while the remaining original members, Eddie Jackson (bass), Michael Wilton (guitar) and Scott Rockenfield (drums) are scheduled to release an album of their own under the Queensryche name later in the year. Basically after 30 years with the band Tate had a falling out with his band mates and left taking the band name and imagery with him, however Jackson, Wilton and Rockenfield share a different point of view and a court hearing will decide who has the rights to the name, so for now, anyway, there are two Queensryches.\n\nSo what's the deal with ""Geoff Tate's Queensryche""?. It has to be said that Tate has assembled an impressive group of heavy hitters. The band features Simon Wright (AC/DC, Dio) on drums, Rudy Sarzo (Ozzy Osbourne, Quiet Riot ,Whitesnake) on bass, Robert Sarzo (Hurricane) on rhythm guitar, Kelly Gray (Myth) on lead guitar and Randy Gane on keyboards. Artists such as K.K. Downing (Judas Priest), Chris Poland (Megadeth) and Lita Ford also make an appearance.\n\nWhat Tate and his new posse have done on Frequency Unknown is capture the vibe of the band from the 80s and 90s with a modern flavour. The album kicks of with Cold, the first single, which hits you in the head with its meaty guitar riffs and rib cracking rhythm section then followed by Dare, Give It To You and Running Backwards with the same ferocity. Life Without You and Weight Of The World could easily be left overs from the Empire sessions, they have that type of feel to them. The album finishes with four reworked versions of songs from the band's catolouge, I Don't Believe In Love, Empire, Jet City Woman and Silent Lucidity.\n\nFor long term fans, Frequency Unknown should serve as a reminder to what Queensryche are capable of, given there average efforts in recent years, and new fans can view Frequency Unknown as a great starting point to become familiar with one of the world's most powerful metal acts.\n\n*Geoff Tate interview available on the Full Throttle Rock site";Full Throttle Rock Magazine Review
46;236.0;2.0;6.0;Queensryche's newest record is a real letdown, this isn't any surprise though. Dedicated To Chaos was just as bad and American Soldier was their last good record. Tribe was a good comeback from Q2K which was a disappointment, American Soldier was one of their best records in years and I thought they were back for good. I was wrong though and their low point came back to haunt them, even more so than before. Frequency Unknown is the opposite of a masterpiece: boring, redundant, mediocre lyrics/music and Geoff Tate's voice sounds worse with each new album. I'm an open minded person and could listen to most stuff but this is one of the worst records of all time. Ranks bellow Judas Priest's Turbo and Van Halen's III.;Queenryche RIP (1983-2009)
52;237.0;5.0;6.0;been a huge fan of geoff tate since the beginning. he has a great bunch of players on this one. not a bad track to be had. glad i preordered it. thanks again;frequency unknown
85;238.0;4.0;6.0;"This is something of a different sound for Queensryche.  However, the only original member in this version is Geoff Tate.  I actually like the songs and music.  It's kind of got an ""updated"" sound.  Now, the bonus tracks, that's another story.  I realize that those are also updated, but, in terms of the melody of the back up vocals, it's not really the same.  Updated or not, I didn't care for them.  Just sounded ""too much"" different.  All in all though, this was a good album.  Sometimes seemed as though Geoff was ""reaching"" too much to give the bonus tracks an updated sound.";Different, but comfortable
106;239.0;3.0;6.0;I'm actually surprised at how good the songs/riffs are and I would say the folks who played on this gave 110% to a quality product. The problem is the vocals. Here I am listening to for all practical purposes a Geoff Tate album in the next room and I can't hear him. He missed a huge opportunity to make a musical statement here, and the re-worked versions don't help his case. On to the real Queensryche release 6-26-13.;Ok...so I bought it
172;240.0;3.0;6.0;I haven't even bought this yet,but I had to put my 2 cents in! Would you give the man a break! He's even said he's not into Heavy Metal! To me Queensryche has never even been a real heavy heavy band,they're melodic and at times a mellow band. I'm one of the few who liked the last QR album and Geoff Tate's last solo album! You have to take it for what it's worth! If you want something a little harder then you can maybe check out the other Queensryche!;Haven't even got this yet!
27;241.0;4.0;5.0;This album is a good album but it should be a Jeff Tate solo record, not Queensryche.  It's a great solo record in my opinion.  Sorry, but the (other) Queensryche record is much more a Queensryche record to me.  I know it sucks for Jeff and what he is going through, but I am enjoying both bands putting out great records.  Its about time!;Better than what I expected
33;242.0;4.0;5.0;I was hesitant before purchasing this cd but, since listening to it I am pleasantly surprised. Geoff Tate is a songwriter, bar none. My personal favorite would be Life Without You.;Tate can still write some very good music
35;243.0;2.0;5.0;Good solo album from Geoff Tate. Gave two stars because it was released as 'Queensryche'. I think Geoff has enough talent to continue his career as a solo artist. The real Queensryche album is the other, with Todd La Torre. Geoff, quit this idea to continue as 'Queensryche'. The real fans will thank you. From: a brazilian fan.;Not Queensryche, but an ok album
37;244.0;3.0;5.0;I will only say that this is a pretty decent album.  On top of that I'll add that if you listen to the bad reviews of it you are buying into the anger that people have at Geoff Tate over the breakup of the original band.  Time to get over it and take the music on its own.;Frequency Unknown
42;245.0;4.0;5.0;Well, it's Geoff Tate's version of Queensryche with Kelly Gray and rocking session musicians - K.K. Downing (Judas Priest), Rudy Sarzo (Ozzy, Dio, Whitesnake), Ty Tabor (Kings'X) and other guys.\nI could ask you: what is the essence of Queensryche sound for the listeners?\nVocals and social lyrics by Geoff, dark atmospheric and in the same time positive songs, heavy sound with a little touch of prog rock and other styles. What we are having here?\nOf course - there are Geoff Tate, his voice and his lyrics. The bad news - for the first half of the album his voice is buried alive among heavy metallic riffs played by Rudy, K.K., Ty and Co. Sometimes I remembered Quite Riot :) No touch of prog...\nGood news - there are some good new songs and from the second half of the album it really works. Thanks to keyboards by Randy Gane - lyricism, atmosphere are returning and the listener is becoming envolved into the album. New versions of Empire, Jet City Woman and Silent Lucidity are not much interesting as themselves but as the final part of the album they are working quite good.\nLet's say the truth - the last albums by Queensryche were not the best part of their discography. You have to be a fan to really like such records as Take Cover or Dedicated to Chaos. I listened to them only once and soon I forgot them. As a fan - give this album a chance.\nI like it because it was recorded with much positive energy and optimism. Believe you would found some good songs here and you would return to them not once.;Impressions are mixed but the album is more interesting than previous releases from the band
44;246.0;4.0;5.0;"From song 5 on this is a GREAT album! 1-4 are real good also. ""In the Hands of God"" might just end up in my top 10 favorite QR songs ever. Skip the re-dos. The originals are classics. Geoff said these were done for financial reasons. Smart man.\n\nIf you are sick & tired of the childish behavior between what is now a broken Queensryche fan community, check out my FB page. All are welcome. No BS allowed. RYCHE ON!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/618093574869848/";Tired of all the childish behavior?
48;247.0;3.0;5.0;"First off, this is an actual review of this album, not a rehashing of complaints against Geoff Tate for the past 20 years of post-deGarmo music. Nobody wants to hear more of that...again.\n\nThere are a few good songs on F.U., one excellent one (Cold) and a couple of duds. Most ""good"" albums have about the same ""hit"" rate of good songs as this one, which is why I don't think its a bad album.  I was actually pleasantly surprised that a Geoff Tate constructed album actually was relatively ""hard"" in terms of the ""rock"" quotient. I too thought the production was pretty average but I disagree with others that it is atrocious...it's not.  Actually the worst part of the production for me was that Tate's voice was actually quite off key in a couple of the songs. Even though Tate's once awe inspiring voice has lost a lot over the years, he is still a great singer. But there is just no excuse for being that off key on a recorded track. A good producer would have definitely insisted Geoff re-record those sections of the vocals while in studio.\n\nNow regarding those re-records of classic QR songs. I took them with a grain of salt. I saw them as Tate's way of saying...see I can't still sing these songs all these years later and sound good. Did he sounds good? Nothing like the original when his voice was still glorious but basically the way he's been singing them live for the past few years which is not bad.  I did find the re-records pretty unnecessary and probably won't be re-listening to them much but they didn't make me go into convulsions like some other reviewers did.\n\nAll in all...I was happy to listen to the album and found it to be decent.  And for what its worth, I don't think either ""QR"" band is the QR we all remember because those guys were a moment in time and that time has long since passed...accept it people!";An honest (and short!) review from a casual QR fan
50;248.0;4.0;5.0;"I decided to take a different view of this album than it seems most did when reviewing Frequency Unknown. Seemed to be based on whether you like Geoff Tate or the other QR coming out this month. This is a good album as a rock album goes. Only one song has the ""sound"" that makes an old QR fan say yeah that's Queensryche. However, the assembled talent on this album is impressive to say the least and all told there is some really good stuff here and well worth getting on it's own merrit. Does it sound like an old Queensyche album ? No. The only two albums that have in the past 20 years are Promised Land and OM 2. Running Backwards is my personal favorite on here which really jams but I do not think there is a bad song on here. The 4 remakes on the other hand stink to high heaven and I shall not listen to them anymore. I gave them 3 listens and will just back to the originals.\nI was a huge Queensryche fan during the 80's and through Empire and Promised Land. Then the bottom fell out which is to say no more Chris Degarmo and it was fortunate to get two or three good songs on a QR cd from then on. People can hate Geoff Tate and love the other band or love Tate and hate the other but really once Degarmo was gone the QR sound went with him. In 2006 Operation Mindcrime II came out and I loved it. It was taking from the old and tinkering enough to make it work. I thought maybe QR was back. The following offerings proved that they weren't. The other QR may be good also but I think they will have a hard time topping Frequency Unknown. But then again they don't have to because the real Queensryche was gone after Promised Land long ago.";Judged on it's own merrit
55;249.0;3.0;5.0;Queensryche's best days are probably behind them, no matter which version of the band you may prefer, and while Geoff Tate's band doesn't break any new ground with Frequency Unknown, there are some solid songs here that I find myself returning to.  Will be interesting to compare this with the self-titled release of his former bandmates.;Not earth-shattering, but not bad
58;250.0;4.0;5.0;Well it not bad to have 2 bands,Confusing and some infighting going on..but thats show business!\n\nThis album is pretty good overall,It should be remixed IMO as the vocals seem real weak.\n But the music is solid and it does rock very hard,Oddly Tate released a solo CD called Kings and Thieves which if you listen to it sounds alot like Queensryche.\n\nGeoff Tate - Singer, songwriter, producer, Insania wine vintner, founding member of Queensryche.\n\nWithout going into all of the legal stuff going on I am hoping this fiasco comes to a good ending,\nQueensryche has made some epic music and that is what I love about them.\n\nBuy this record and decide for yourself,If you hate Tate well don't buy it then.;So we have 2 Queensryche bands
98;251.0;3.0;5.0;First of all, this is NOT the worst Queensryche record you could buy. About half the songs are pretty damn good. For a guy who claims to not be a metal fan, he has an all star headbanger guest line up. Rudy Sarzo is the bassist, Simon freakin Wright is the drummer, KK Downing & Lita Metalhead Ford are the axeslingers. Also Paul{Slayer) Bastoph, & Ty Tabor of Kings X are guest vocalists.  So maybe he was cranky when he said he's not a metal fan. There is some serious Metal on this disc, and Geoff Tates voice is sounding good. You either like it or leave it. This rat rocks.;Not your dad's Queensryche
216;252.0;3.0;5.0;"Always been a Queensrcyhe and Geoff Tate fan...If you're a fan of the band at least download 'Cold' it's clearly the best song...to pacific those who wrote ""do not buy"" all over, I'll properly end up buying the other Queensrcyhe album when it comes out, but I doubt it'll be any better.";'Cold' is the best song on this lukewarm album
217;253.0;1.0;5.0;"If life were fair, I'd be more objective here and give it two stars. There's actually a handful of pretty good ideas musically speaking on this recording.\n\nBut life isn't fair. Tate accusing his former bandmates of bringing Queensryche down over the years? Not fair. And this barely polished turd of an album lays bare, once and for all, the real reason Queensryche's recordings have been magnificent disasters for damn near 20 years. And that reason is Geoff. And because that truth is so brazenly blatant now, I'm giving one instead of two stars.\n\nA lot has been said about the poor quality of the vocals, mix, and instrumentation. All true. And there's no need to rehash that. I think we can all agree (all of us with ears and not on the Tate payroll, that is...) that all of these things sound flat, lifeless, and in some cases, out of place. Sometimes, even out of tune. What a lot of people aren't really commenting on is the real reason that this, and everything since Promised Land, does not, and will NEVER sound like the real Queensryche: the arrangements. Queensryche songs were, once upon a time, flowing, interesting compositions. That hasn't been the case for a good long time. Of late, they've just been big dumb rock songs with the occasional jazzy key change thrown in the middle for the sake of maintaining some sort of prog-like veneer. And at no time in Tate's stewardship of the QR brand the veneer been so thin, and the rock sounds even bigger and dumber. Mr. 81% would have you believe that he's responsible for Queensryche's success all by himself. That is, in a word: crap. The greatest things to ever come from the band were group efforts where collaboration was the heart and soul of great songs like The Needle Lies, I Will Remember, No Sanctuary, The Thin Line, Promised Land, etc. None of the songs on F.U. take their time to get where they're going (like all the great QR tunes do). Instead, they rush (much like the thought process behind this album) to make a point, and in their haste, make none at all. That's NOT good songwriting. Just as a handful of heavy riffs with Tate seemingly fighting a snot-bubble over them does NOT make something metal\n\nBuyer beware. This is NOT Queensryche. This is NOT memorable. And most of all, this is NOT metal. It's a giant ""FU"" to the fans of the band and the genre that spawned it. June 11th, and the actual Queensryche's album, can't come soon enough to wash away this bitter stain on the legacy of this once great band.\n\nTo those that had this review when it was originally posted removed, know this: I will not be silenced.\n\nF.U. too, Geoff. F.U. too...";Back atcha, Tate

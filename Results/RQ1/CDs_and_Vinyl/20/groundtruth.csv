10;1.0;5.0;43.0;"This review is based on the Special Edition, which includes 4 bonus tracks & expanded packaging. It is not a review of the Special Fan Pack"" which includes 2 other bonus songs. It can be obtained through Amazon or Best Buy. As far as the music goes, this is very guitar oriented, 100% Pure American Southern Rock of totally BRAND NEW MATERIAL, from Skynyrd.\n\nI don't understand how any band can be more of a ""Southern Rock Band"" than Skynyrd. Skynyrd is the ""Standard"" when it comes to ""Southern Rock"". They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. I've been a fan ever since they first came out in the early 1970's. I still have concert ticket stubs from the ""original"" Ronnie Van Zant version of Skynyrd. I've seen all the various line-ups through the years, and I've always loved every version of Skynyrd. I've heard all the pros & cons about Skynyrd sounding like ""Country"", & ""Country"" sounding like Skynyrd, but to me, Skynyrd is as Pure of an American Southern Rock Band, as you can get. Their songs are for all hard working Americans, North, South, East or West, and also for their many fans in other countries. Their songs address ""real life"" issues"". Like Artimus Pyle once said, ""Lynyrd Skynyrd is about the Real World"", and that tradition continues in this new release.\n\nThe 4 Bonus Tracks on this Special Edition include:\n\n12. Poor Man's Dream\n13. Do It Up Right\n14. Sad Song\n15. Low Down Dirty\n\nThis is the first Skynyrd Album (other than the Original Muscle Shoals Album), that does not include the late/great Billy Powell on keyboards. However, his  replacement, Peter ""Keys"" Pisarczyk, formerly from various versions of George Clinton's Parliment/Funkadelic Band, does a good job of playing keyboards for Skynyrd. I've seen him perform ""live"" with Skynyrd. He plays a Black Piano, in respect for Billy Powell, who always played a White Piano. Although there are no extended piano solos on this new album, Peter's piano playing is somewhat featured at the beginning of ""Ready To Fly"", & on the bonus song ""Do It Up Right"". Also, another change included on this album is a brand new bass guitar player, Johnny Colt, formerly from the Black Crowes. Also, you get some recording session guitar playing from ""John 5"", who has performed & recorded with Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, & Others.\n\nTo me, this album is somewhat similar to the Skynyrd Album ""The Last Rebel"". It does not contain the ""political messages"" that were included in the ""God & Guns"" Album. Although it is Brand New Material, it does contains some references back to earlier versions of Skynyrd. For example, in the song ""Last of a Dyin' Breed"", it includes references to the song ""Travelin' Man"" from the past. Another example is ""Mississippi Blood"", it is similar to the song ""Mississippi Kid"" from the ""Pronounced"" Album. The song ""Something To Live For"" includes the words ""No, I'll Never Change"", which is similar to the part of ""Freebird"", which includes the lyrics ""And This Bird Will Never Change"". Overall, this is a VERY GUITAR ORIENTED album. Skynyrd still has that POWERFUL 3 GUITAR ATTACK, this time with Gary Rossington, Rickey Medlocke, & ""Sparky"" Matejka.\n\nIn the liner notes, there is a statement remembering all the previous members of Skynyrd, who have passed on. They include: Ronnie, Allen, Leon, Billy, Steve, Cassie, Jo Jo, Ean, & Hughie. I was a personal friend of Jo Jo Billingsley (an original backing singer (Honkette), in the pre-plane crash version of Skynyrd. She will be greatly missed.\n\nI'm going to see Lynyrd Skynyrd live in concert tonight, August 24, 2012 in Bossier City, Louisiana. I'm really looking forward to it. ""Can't Wait"". I hope this review has been helpful. Thanks!!!!!\n\nP.S. Well I saw Skynyrd last night in Bossier City, Louisiana on their ""Last of a Dyin' Breed Tour"". I got to stand near the front of the stage. They started the show with the song ""Last of a Dyin' Breed"", and they also performed the song ""Good Teacher"" from this album. The concert was ""awesome"". The newer members did an outstanding job. The new bassist Johnny Colt, did a phenomenal job on the bass, he had a beard, and wore a hat with a Rebel Flag on the front. His style was a lot like the original Skynyrd bassist, the late/great Leon Wilkeson. This was one fantastic concert, one of the best I'm seen since I last saw Skynyrd with ZZ Top ,last year on thier ""Rebels & Bandolieros/Skynyrd Nation Tour"" of 2011.""";"The Special  Edition With 4 Bonus Tracks = 15 Tracks of BRAND NEW GUITAR ORIENTED"" MATERIAL FROM SKYNYRD."""
1;2.0;5.0;5.0;This CD is very good and its definitely a good buy because it is what you would expect from Lynyrd Skynyrd. The music is right for what is going on in the world and on the right track because it comes from a southern rock band that's been around for a long time.;Southern Rock
3;3.0;5.0;25.0;"Based strictly on the strength of the songs and performances, this is one of skynyrd's best-certainly of the Johnny era-but holds up respectably w/ anything they've done.  Would it be better and/or sound more authentically skynyrd w/ Leon, Billy and you name the other departed/estranged former member, most likely.  However, it is stunning and showcases a band of die hards (and hired guns)who still care enough to make the best music they can.  For all the clowns that write it off w/o giving it any shot b/c every surviving member is not a part of the current band, get real.  How many girlfriends/wives from the '70's do you still talk to?  Try being married to 6 spouses-no way it can always work; not to mention the ones that time claims.  Setting that pointless argument aside, these songs deserve to be heard and savored-they are extremely well crafted and exquisitely produced-everything is mixed w/ power and the guitars are set on stun!!  If you have ever loved the band, this is a safe bet.  If you love southern rock, it's a safe bet.  I can recommend it w/o reservation. Skynyrd may have spent the last 20+ years relying too heavily on the same classics in the live shows, but they continue to offer proof that they can write and/or allign themselves w/ excellent writers and turn out bonafide ass kicking new product. There is no reason not to support this album w/ a purchase.";Hit w/ the sweet spot of the bat....
9;4.0;1.0;23.0;The disgrace that Johnny and Gary have brought to this once great band is immensiable. Rossington wrote a few good tunes, and he took part in the co-writing of a few others, but he was not the driving force behind the band. He and Ronnie's brother however are the reason this band is still together. Negating a contract which said they would end the band once three original members were no longer in it, they have now hijacked the name and turned this band into what Nickelback would sound like if they recorded in Nashville or if Big & Rich recorded in British Columbia...If you didn't get the joke, they would sound like each other. There is not a shred of originality or an ounce of care for the legacy left behind by the real Lynyrd Skynyrd. This album is chock full of cliched Nickelback lyrics and riffs. Instead of carrying on the tradition of great outlaw music that the original band wrote that influenced generations to come, they have let the airwaves of clear channel, corporate radio influence them. There is nothing outlaw about that. They have just stolen the name of a great band, because they know the music they make wouldn't sell any other way. These guys don't care about the legacy or the fans...They just care about themselves. Go listen to Artimus Pyle's album 'Artimus Venomus' and get his take of this band calling themselves Skynyrd.;Poor Ronnie...
13;5.0;3.0;19.0;"Having been a long-time Lynyrd Skynyrd fan of both the pre-crash and post crash era I was anxious to see how this album would sound with yet another original Skynyrd member gone (Billy Powell).\n\nThe album has some highs and lows"".....It starts off very good with the tracks ""Last of a Dyin Breed"" and ""One day at a time"". Two well written songs that are performed in good classic Skynyrd style. These songs are definitely the highlights of the album and likely the only songs that will get any play time on tour or radio.\n\n  The third song on the album ""Homegrown"" takes a severe right turn to nowhere. Not sure why or how that song even made the album. Very bad lyrics, terrible flow and nothing that resembles any sign of classic Skynyrd sound. Just killed the momentum that the album started out with. Definitely the worst song on the album.\n\n  The bottom line...........if you are a fan of classic Skynyrd sound you will find some love for the tunes ""Last of a Dyin' Breed""....""One day at a time"" and ""Ready to Fly"". The rest of the album is just ""OK"". Nothing really stands out as something you will want to listen to time and time again. The guitars are very heavy and edgy sounding at times and continually drown out Johnny Vanzants voice on some songs. This was never the case with past material. Unfortunately, the signature ""dual guitar"" sound that many fans crave on many of the classic tunes are not heard much on this album. The loss of Billy Powell is very evident. Those honky-tonk piano solos are sadly gone. Billy was such a huge part in the sound of the band that I knew couldn't be replaced.\n\n ""Last of a Dyin Breed"" is not a great album, nor is it a bad album. Just somewhere in the middle would be fair judgement. That's why I gave it 3 stars. This album could have easily been a 2-star rating if it had not been for a handful of songs that are good. It also could have been a 4 star rating had all the songs had the same classic style and sound as the first two songs on the album.\n\nI'd like to see Skynyrd continue to tour and do albums but only if they can get back to writing material and produce the sound that brings them back to their classic sound and style. I would like to see them get guys like Ed King back in the fold to at least provide some writing skills. Other similar style musicians like Charlie Daniels, Hank Williams Jr.,Jeff Carlisi would be a good idea to bump ideas for future material providing this isn't the last Skynyrd album we hear.""";Not great but not bad...
12;6.0;2.0;13.0;"After listening to this album and trying to convince myself that it's good, I just can't. It feels incredibly forced. It seems that the band is trying way to hard to appeal to the rowdy, beer drinkin, bar fightin country crowd. They do a good job of that, but that's not what Skynyrd is about. A couple of the songs are of pretty good quality with Ready To Fly"" being the best of the bunch and the title track not too far behind.\n\nThe music on the album is right in line with the other output of the ""post crash"" Skynyrd, but leaning a little on the country side. The RVZ led lineups could toe that line between Hard Rock and Country perfectly, but that's a quality that this lineup can't seem to achieve. The lyrical content on many tracks is trying to be deep and meaningful and it just comes off as rather cheesy. When the lyrics are not meant to be deep and just rock they come off as hokie as can be. Songs about the tough times and working hard, callouses on the hands and it just comes off as amateurish at times.\n\nI really think it's just about time for Skynyrd to be put to bed for good. If this band wants to keep on touring and recording albums, fine, but it just shouldn't have the Skynyrd name attached to it. With Gary Rossington being the only ""pre crash"" member left, it just doesn't feel the same. When Billy Powell and Leon Wilkeson were still alive it at least felt like Skynyrd beings there were three originals.\n\nBottom line is the album is not bad, but it's really not that good either. If you like modern country that leans a little towards the harder side, then this album is for you. If you like the ""classic"" Skynyrd sound, this ain't it. If you really want to listen to ""new"" Skynyrd, stick with ""Vicious Cycle"". It is a far superior album.""";Not worthy of the Skynyrd name
11;7.0;1.0;12.0;THIS BAND IS MORE LIKE NASHVILLE COUNTRY THAN A LEGENDARY SOUTHERN ROCK BAND, DONT WASTE YOUR $ LIKE I DID... ANOTHER WEAK EFFORT BY THE HOUSE BAND FROM FOX NEWS;SOUNDS THE SAME AS THE LAST 5 CDS THEY PUT OUT
4;8.0;1.0;11.0;"This latest offering adds nothing new to the Skynyrd legacy; the subjects and lyrics I've heard all before.  Songs such as Home Grown, Mississippi Blood, Good Teacher and Honey Hole from a lyrical standpoint sound as if they were written by some teenagers.  For the next album, the band should consider bringing in some outside writers.  In summary, good musicians + bad material = bad album.";Nothing New
8;9.0;2.0;10.0;I am a huge Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, of the old band and the current band. Nothing will touch the Ronnie Van Zant era. I have been listening to this cd for about a week now and it is rated as my least favorite Skynyrd album. It has a few ok tracks but over all it stinks. I played the record for my 17 year old daughter who is a Skynyrd fan and the first comment from her was it's weird and I agree. The vocal effects are done to much and the lyrical content is just weird. I don't know if it is to much John 5 influence or the alternative influence from the producer, it is just a weird record. It is hard for me to write this review because I love the guy's but this record is depressing to me personally.;Not that great
5;10.0;5.0;9.0;welp. i been lestin too these rascals since i 1st herad freebird . yeah i,m a dern redneck from Mississippi in the country and do drrink a lotta beer but thass no matter i know this is the best set o southern rock i bought in a looongass time and sure as shit beats any o that other crap out cept the black keys yje new Savoy brown and some othe r ones. anyhow if ya liked Viscious cyclke and ya like good ole music ya will like this un. trk. 1 and trk 10 are my favorites but them others are mostly good too i aint much on the slow ones tho.  honey hole started slow but that sunofagun kicked my butt. damn goood tunes lynyrd thanx fer keepin the music goin. harry, i didn't mean the keys was better , i jus mean it aint a whole lotta music out there thaT rocks me right. i dunno if this makes since but its a fine damn cd this is the long version too/  course this is my opion like man vs food picked a samich woth brocolli on there it aint good. ya,ll no what i mean i hope.;"hell  i like it purty damn good."""
19;11.0;5.0;9.0;If you are a true fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd, this album will not disappoint. If you are looking to hear the same music as the pre crash band, look elsewhere. As much as the pre crash band rocked and wrote amazing songs, this is not them. The current lineup has produced some OK albums in the past, this and Vicious Cycle being the best. Still unbroken was pretty good as well. One thing i cant stand are the people who compare current band to pre crash band. Get over the past and try and enjoy current bands music and style.\n\nMy fav songs so far on this album are Homegrown, Something to live for, nothing comes easy, Honey Hole and last of a dying breed;Sounds great
7;12.0;1.0;8.0;SOUNDS LIKE EDGE OF FOREVER, TWENTY, GOD N GUNS, VICIOUS CYCLE, ETC. MEDLOCKE , ROSSINGTON ,AND VAN ZANT MUST COME UP WITH A ONE LINER AND WRITE SONGS AROUND THAT. THE REAL WRITERS IN SKYNYRD AND BLACKFOOT WERE RONNIE VAN ZANT , ALLEN COLLINS AND JAKSON SPIRES . IF THIS BAND WERE NOT CALLED LYNYRD SKYNYRD THE SONGS ON THE LAST 5 CDS WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY ON CD.LAST OF A DYING BREED IS OFFICALLY DEAD;THE MYTT RMNY BAND
6;13.0;4.0;7.0;This album offers very little in the way of sounding like cassic Lynyrd Skynyrd. Once or if one is able to get passed that, there's plenty to like here. I think this is the best album song for song that they've recorded since 1993's The Last Rebel. If you're wanting highlights, I'd recommend the following tracks: Last Of A Dyin' Breed, One Day At A Time, Homegrown, Honey Hole, Life's Twisted, Start Livin' Life Again and Do It Up Right (only available on the deluxe edittion). I listed 7 songs and I don't think I might have liked about that many songs in all between their last 2 studio albums (2003's Vicious Cycle and 2009's God & Guns). Oh, and about the criticism they've gotten for appearin Fox & Friends...get over it people. If Springsteen, The Eagles and countless other leftist artists can do fundraisrs for liberal candidates and not incur your wrath, then Skynyrd should be afforded that same respect.;Solid 4 Star Album
2;14.0;5.0;5.0;"I am a Skynard fan going back to the 70's. I still have an unopened Street Survivors album. To me, I was always a little scheptical about any new releases beyond the original Skynard. Over the years I have enjoyed the New"" releases a little more as the modern band matured. The God And Guns album is a great collection of songs which are well written and relate to our currant times. The Last Of A Dying breed is one of the best written releases to date. Ready To Fly is about family, getting older, what all of us will go through in time, excellant song. Good Teacher, from learning about love, to life, to school, great song. Start Livin' life Again, About the excesses in life. All the songs are well written, well played. I know that there is only one original member left, but you have to check this out. Give a listen, than listen again and again. I believe you will pick your favorites. Out of 11 songs, 9 are excellant, two are great. With the quality of song writing, the excellant ability of these musicians, I hope the title doesn't mean it's their last.""";Last of a dyin breed may be their best. MP3 download Amazon
14;15.0;5.0;7.0;Wow!! this is a really good album. I think you are going to see more than a few of these songs played on the radio.;best since 77
16;16.0;5.0;6.0;The song REady To Fly is worth the price of admission.  Oh yeah, the rest of its pretty darn good also.  Get it!;Skynyrd is back baby! (not that they really left)
17;17.0;3.0;6.0;It's either bad Skynyrd or a really good Montgomery Gentry or Toby Keith album. I can't decide. But either way most of the songs have really good hooks but lack some searing guitar leads like Skynyrd of old. A little better than GOD & Guns but not by a wide margin so if you enjoyed that one you should this one as well. And make sure you get the deluxe edition because the bonus tracks are just as good if not better than those on the standard edition.;NEW SKYNYRD?
0;18.0;5.0;5.0;"Lynyrd Skynyrd's new CD, LAST OF A DYIN' BREED, is their best in many years, possibly since 1977's STREET SURVIVORS. Unlike GOD & GUNS, which was generally great but had a few weak songs, this one is consistent from soup to nuts. It's obvious that the band has been listening to new-generation Southern bands like Preacher Stone and Blackberry Smoke; 70s hard rockers such as Molly Hatchet, Blackfoot, and Montrose; 90s/early 2000s rockers like 3 Doors Down and Nickelback; and the Outlaws' anthology BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES for inspiration, and the result is their heaviest CD yet, with songs that testify to the strength of the human spirit. This CD is a must-own for any serious popular music fan.";Lynyrd Skynyrd's Best In Many Years
15;19.0;5.0;5.0;In this album skynyrd comes back with another great set of what will soon be hits. They are still the greatest rock band ever in my opinion and this album as well as their endurance proves that.;Still Rocking
18;20.0;5.0;5.0;I am VERY impressed with this album! Sure, this isn't the best version of Lynyrd Skynyrd but it's still very good! Hope these guys come back around on tour soon!;Lynyrd Skynyrd STILL rocks!!

12;1.0;4.0;1709.0;"When ""Knight Rider"" and ""Bay Watch"" ended, I felt a distinct void in my life. Without Hasselfhoff's bouncing pecs gracing my television, life simply felt drab and unfulfilling.\n\nImagine my delight when I discovered that Hasselhoff had not disappeared at all, but rather REEMERGED, this time as a serious force in music. It reminded me of when Leonard Nimoy had recorded his stirring tribute to Tolkien, ""The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins."" It was that moving and momentous for me.\n\nHonestly, few Americans truly appreciate how Hasselhoff singularly reshaped the entire landscape of German music. Auf wiedersehen, Amadeus. Hasselhoff ist hier!\n\nI particularly recommend the track ""Do the Limbo Dance"" but am giving the album just four stars because I'm a bit disappointed that he didn't stick with the original German version, ""Tanzen Limbo, Ya!""";This David is a GOLIATH
374;2.0;5.0;527.0;"There is little doubt now that David Husselshaft is a major force in the music business these days. I've already been a fan for many years, but an amazing thing happened recently which I have to share. The doctor said my dog Cherish had only days to live. Desperate for any sign of recovery, I played this CD in the garage for him 24/7, and not only did my dog die, but so did 2 cats and all of my plants. My neighbor came down with a rare form of stomach virus, the one causes massive cramping and explosive diarrhea. Boy did I prove that doctor wrong!\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";A little something for everyone on this disc!
497;3.0;4.0;7.0;"I was hosting a Fourth of July barbecue last year and thought to myself, ""What better way to celebrate America than with the music of American treasure David Hasselhoff?"" And as it turned out, I was right - everyone at the party complimented me on my impeccable taste. The only problem was that, as the party went on, more and more Germans began drifting by to listen. I had no idea America was such a popular destination for German tourists - there were almost a hundred loitering outside my house only an hour after the barbecue started. It seemed like every German within a ten-mile radius had been attracted by the incredible range of emotions the Hoff's dulcet tones could convey.\n\nIn conclusion - you probably shouldn't play this CD outside, or at high volume. It's simply too powerful to be exposed to the masses like that.";Great at parties - but be careful
318;4.0;5.0;315.0;"Economic nationalists throughout the country shuddered when the Commerce Department announced a Q3 trade imbalance comfortably exceeding $100 billion, the highest on record.  We buy our electronics from Japan, our confections from France, and our oil from the Persian Gulf.  So why must we import the cream of our own culture from abroad?  We don't store the Constitution in Germany.  We don't launch the Space Shuttle from China.  So why must we buy our Hasselhoff from distant foreign lands?  Demand for this benchmark piece of Americana will surely send the trade economy reeling even closer to the abyss.\nIts pending stupefying popularity notwithstanding, this is not an album without flaws, as flaws are inevitable when one takes on the impossible task of distilling Hasselhoff to a single disk.  This is, after all, akin to reducing Aristotle to a lone pamphlet - nay, a matchbook cover.  Because while this CD does include every Hasselhoff song that topped the charts in ninety countries or more, it was really the deep album work that made Hasselhoff synonymous with underground edge, incendiary lyrics, and youthful angst the world over.  The poets who found their calling in the deeply nuanced lyrics of 1984's ""Night Rocker"" will be crestfallen to see that album underrepresented beyond its touchstone hits.  Jungle-based rebels from Columbia to Burma who viewed 1989's ""Looking for Freedom"" as a clarion call to arms will be outraged that the entire second side of that inflammatory album is absent (with the inevitable exception of ""Flying on the Wings of Tenderness"").  And lovers who exchanged their lifetime vows to the ballads of ""Crazy For You"" will be devastated to see that only two of them are included here (even ""I Wanna Move to the Beat of Your Heart"" is inexplicably omitted!).  However, the wounds gouged into our souls by these countless omissions are salved by the sweet succor of the eighteen songs that are included.  All told, despite the travesties that come from reducing Hasselfhoff to a single disc, this is clearly one of the finest works in the entire oeuvre of human expression.";Achtung!  Achtung!  Der GENIUS of Herr Hasselhoff!!
341;5.0;5.0;189.0;After hearing the sweet voice of David Hankipants, I felt like throwing my disgusted, lifeless body off a tall bridge and plummeting into the deep, freezing waters below. As I got to song 2, I began to vomit uncontrollably all over my floor. The torture continued until song 13, at which time I was rushed to the hospital because my ears had begun to bleed severely. My doctor's told me I had suffered a severe brain contusion, possibly from dangerous exposure to ultra-high gamma frequencies aka bad music.\nWhen I got home, Scruffy, my canine, was dead. He had been exposed to Song 4 and scrathed his own ears off. As he lay in a puddle of his own blood, I will never forgive myself for buying David Hankiman's CD...;David is a pure genius

483;7.0;5.0;124.0;"What more could be said about David Hasselhoff's looks. Nothing. So it's only icing on the cake that he also has musical talent. And not just your average, Dave Grohl-can-sing kind of talent; Hasselhoff towers above the average singer with his rapid-style singsong rapping. The inflections he gives betray a profound understanding of subtlety, the restraint of a genius. He purposely, almost defiantly avoids hitting the ""correct"" notes on ""Flying on the Wings of Tenderness,"" ""Crazy For You,"" ""I Believe,"" ""Wir Zwei Allein,"" ""Je T'aime Means I Love You,"" ""Freedom For the World,"" and ""Dance Dance D'amour,"" as well as on the rest of the songs on the CD. His mastery of the English language not enough to sate his hunger for lyrics, he crosses over into German, French and even Swahili in some of the songs, giving speakers of those languages something new to revile. Hasselhoff's contribution to musicdom is immeasurable, so you might as well put away whatever measuring devices you were about to use on him.\nThe song 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good.";As moist and tender as brownies
14;8.0;1.0;38.0;"This CD came in the mail today and I was very excited to finally hear the best of David Hasselhoff.  To my dismay however, this album is an exact copy of the ""Worst of David Hasselhoff"" CD which I already own.  Perhaps it's because Davd Hasselhoff really really really needs the money that he'd release a CD which is both simultaneously his best and worst music.  Or perhaps it's because this CD is imported, and somehow people from outside of this country were confused into thinking David Hasselhoff's worst is really his best.  I can't say.  All I know is I now have one too many copies of a David Hasselhoff CD, which puts me afoul of the law.  I don't want to end up on an FBI list someplace or have a court order forcing me to go door to door explaining why I'm a Hasselhoff offender to my neighbors.  So I think I'm just going to return this as quickly as possible and buy something from John Tesh instead.";I feel ripped off
226;9.0;5.0;62.0;"What can you say about David Hasselhoff that hasn't already been said one thousand times before? The man is quite simply a musical genius. Hasselhoff's entire arsenal of musical weaponry is on full display in this album, a collection of his biggest hits.\nAt first I didn't really believe that David Hasselhoff, international star of television and cinema, could actually be a talented musician. I was skeptical to say the least. Then my friend played a few Hasselhoff songs for me and wow, I was hooked.\nThe words flowed forth from Hasselhoff's tender lips like sweet nectar from the mouth of God himself. I found myself in a trance of pure joy and ecstacy as the soothing rhythms caressed my ear. Hasselhoff's hymns had brought me to the summit of human achievement and I was now free to look down at the wreckage and ruin that lie below. I stared into the distance and said, ""Oh thine Hasselhoff, how thy music hath saved my immortal soul.""\nTo say that the beautiful music of David Hasselhoff is life-changing would be an insult; a disservice. Hasselhoff's music is life-making, and I can only hope that you too will experience its profound gifts.";On the first day, God created David Hasselhoff
494;10.0;5.0;61.0;"Oh, mon dieu! Not since The White Album or An Innocent Man has one album forever changed the landscape of recorded music! Hasselhoff manages to morph between genres, blending rock, rock 'n roll, and hard rock into his own creation. A single review cannot express the sheer joy and devastation I feel at hearing this amazing collection. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Buy the whole KITT and caboodle!
16;11.0;5.0;25.0;I found an old shoebox of cds at a garage sale for $3.  Probably 50 cds in there.  Obviously $3 was way too high.  So I countered with 25 cents. They seller scoffed at me which oddly rhymes with hoffed.  Odd I felt this was some sort of omen from the hassley one himself.  I then saw an elderly women making her way up the driveway and I knew she was going to try to buy these cds from me.  I quickly shoved $200 into the gentlemans hand and said you never seen me here, YOU HEAR!?  grabbed the box and sprinted to my car.  Quickly, I drove home and ran into my basement... or was it my attic.  No Im pretty sure it was the basement.  85% sure it was my basement.  I flung CD out 1 by 1, Cher, the Proclaimers, Billy Joel, garbage, more garbage, I knew it was in here, somewhere!  Finally, my last 2 cds, on top, which I kept as a keepsake because you know where I am getting... was Joey Lawrence - Nothing can fix my love (it TOUCHED this CD which makes it epic).  And under that, the best of David Hasselhoff.  Overcome with joy, I realized how awful I started to feel.  $200?  Thats all I gave that poor man for this CD?  I went to the nearest bank and quickly emptied my bank account.  $734.55.  I went to give this man the rest of my money and when I arrived at the house... the house was gone.  It was like it never existed.  I looked into the heavens for answers, and in my heart, all I could hear was track 12.  The best is yet to come.  So I wait, on this empty plot of land... waiting for one day... for the hoff to deliver more of these pearls of music.  Thank you hoff.... thank you.;Getting hoff on the hoff
445;12.0;5.0;52.0;"...along came David, and suddenly everything changed.\nFor a laugh - in those days it was always for a cheap laugh - I went out and bought Looking for - Best of David Hasselhoff. How ironic I thought I was being. How big, how clever of me to ridicule a recording artist shunned by so many of the ""in crowd"". What did I think it would achieve? I don't honestly know - but perhaps I thought my cynicism would make me popular and more attractive to women.\nLittle did I know that within hours the small-minded man I had been would be all but dead, leaving behind a boy - yes a boy - full of hope, excitement and joy.\nFrom the moment I hit play and Looking for Freedom kicked in, I felt something melt inside me. Within minutes the black hole that had been my heart was no longer and I was on the floor crying tears of unashamed happiness. I won't bore you with all the details of my epiphany, but let's just say that by the time Hot Shot City was over the caterpillar had become a butterfly.\nWords cannot express how strongly I urge you to buy this album. I'm sure you too are a cynic, reading this webpage for a ""big joke"". But what have you got to lose, ""big joker""? Buy it ironically, buy it mockingly or buy it with near religious zeal - but for heaven's sake buy it. One way or another it will change the way you think forever.\nStill not sure? Then ask yourself this: what is more important in your life - ""cool"" or ""love""? Give love a chance - give David a chance.";Dave pulls no punches on this emotional rollercoaster
495;13.0;5.0;53.0;Listening to this album is not so much a musical experience as a quasi-religious one. David is already the world's biggest TV star, an object of desire  for all women and role-model for all men. Now he reveals an unequalled musical ability. The range and sensitivity displayed here will leave your  eyebrows in your hair. He effortlessly runs the whole emotional gamut from 'happy' to 'sad'. With this 'best of' compilation he has filled a  much-needed gap.;A once in a Lifetime experience

You know how you look up a product and underneath it there is always the: ""Customers who bought this also bought""? Well that's what hooked me. That and the oxymoronic title - ""Looking For The BEST of David Hasselhoff"". Now I said to myself, ""Studly, I think this calls for some investigation"" (that's the name my inner-voice calls myself while most just yell ""Hey you, stop that! I can water my own flowers. Now put that away or I'll call local constabulary.""). I figured if aliens were going to make contact they would likely use a famous figure. Who better than a man who drives a talking car. Well from the first track to the finale ""I believe"" his duet with Laura Branigan - I DID BELIEVE ! Yes not only did I believe in UFOs and that they'd make contact with The Hof but that The Hof himself was the product of a coupling between a human and an extraterrestrial. He was conceived to help us make our way into the next millennium and what sealed the deal was reading the review of George Takei - Oh  My.

249;17.0;5.0;36.0;"It's no surprise that Hasslelhoff has been nominated for immediate canonization in the wake of the release of this collection of hits.  The album is, simply-put, the Word of God.  Each note, each beat, each utterance reflects a long and careful dialogue with the Lord Himself, resulting in total perfection in the most analytical sense of the word.  ""Looking For--Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]"" is the first real tangible evidence we have of the existence of a higher power.\n""Do the Limbo Dance"" is nothing short of miraculous; Hasselhoff single-handedly refutes the soon-to-be-rejected laws of physics in this daedal little piece illustrating a communal dance where one's weight and center of gravity are impossibly ignored through rhythm, faith, and a flaming pole.  The song is intensely moving, replete with danger, suspense, and above all, love.\n""Flying on the Wings of Tenderness"" picks right up where ""Limbo"" left off.  Hasselhoff not only successfully depicts a formless entity mere mortals perceive as ""tenderness"" as a walking, breathing, selfless beast of burden, but climbs right on top of it and goes on an astounding journey through time, space, and far away lands.  ""I got on those wings / and rode that tenderness beast / and rode it"" belts Hasselhoff in the song's chorus.  The audience is enthusiastically invited along as Hasselhoff and his beast graciously navigate through other-worldly civilizations where an entire gamut of emotions-turned-tangible dwell and interact.\nHasselhoff leaves no questions unanswered when he clearly reveals his divine stature as the second Son of Man in ""Save the World.""  Previously while starring in both of his famous television series, Knight Rider and Baywatch, he had been vaguely alluded to as somewhat of a Christ figure by critics and fans alike, but now there is no question who Hasselhoff really is as he croons ""gonna judge you baby yeah / you're gonna go to heaven it's true / baby shhhhhhhhh be quiet / gonna play that harp in heaven pour vous.""\nAfter this song the rest of the album serves as an interactive rite of passage for any listener willing to believe in Hasselhoff, culminating with the testimony of superstar Laura Branigan in the final track, ""I Believe.""  In this beautifully performed a capella duet, Branigan professes her belief that ""[Hasselhoff] is my Lord and shepherd / take me away / oh dear Lord and shepherd / what price must I pay?"" to which Hasselhoff replies, ""Baby my love is free / so free / all you gots to do / is believe.""\nThe album is not only brilliant, miraculous, and life-altering, but a true testament, or better, a Third Testament, to the word of God.  Reader: take heed and listen to this album lest you miss the rapture train.";Aural Rapture:  Hasslelhoff Finally Delivers Salvation
316;18.0;5.0;35.0;Like a jukebox rolled in body hair, David Hasselhoff is a versatile, astounding performer whose range of songs cannot be denied. Each time he picks up a microphone, people everywhere groan with dread, because they all know too well that they are witnessing the finest musical experience of their lives and are ill-prepared to soak it in before that moment's gone forever. It's not surprising that many have compared hearing David Hasselhoff singing to having a death in the family.\nAnd sure, he is showmanship. He is glitz. But even beyond that, he has substance. His songs have each been put on a stick and dipped in rich meaning. One should savor each song for a while, sucking on them until the nougat of their essence, the essence of their nougat, flow out.\nNow I'm not exactly what you'd call a religious man. I have my background rooted in the cold, hard realities of science. But after witnessing David Hasselhoff throat out these 18 songs at a concert he held for flood victims in Switzerland with a voice that can be compared to a hippo stuck in a rusty beartrap, I do believe that a Hell exists.\nThe song Hot Shot City is particularly good.;You don't have to be German to love him!
493;19.0;5.0;35.0;Gob-smacked. That was my initial response on originally hearing this CD.\nHow could one man possibly produce what will surely go down as a classic tale of fortune and glory, in musical form. Akin to Pink Floyd The Wall, though somewhat more upbeat, this album, if it can indeed be classed as such, takes us on a walk through Mr Hasselhoff's psyche, from his childsome chains, up to his current immeasurable high.\nHasselhoffs tale, remarkable would be an underestimate, is a testament to the very soul of man. He is always 'looking for the best', and not once has he wavered from this path.;Obliterating the dimensions of music

How can you employ something as lowly as language to convey the emotions aroused by this celestial work?\nI believe that God has blessed Hassselhofff with many fine things.  Lush hair, a winning smile, a talking car.  But nothing, NOTHING is as important as the gift of divine melodic construction that the Lord saw fit to bestow on this fine auteur's shoulders.\nOut of all the tracks on this meisterwork, I would highly recommend the song ""Hot Shot City"", as it is particularly good.";Where are the words?

Those who have already discovered its pleasures know the specialness and exceptionality that this music presents. With a flair for showmanship and two enormous pecs as his backup men, David Haltertosh shines withall the glory and dazzle that he can bring to the world of song. He rears his golden head back and vomits out the most eternally mindblowing baritone voice you have ever heard, a voice that sort of sounds like an ox stepping on a railroad spike. Witness the sonorous tones of his masterful voice on ""Crazy For You."" Behold Hankershank's trademark howl on the ditty ""Je T'Aime Means I Can't Sing."" Thrill to the talented talent he holds in the heartstring puller ballad ""Is Everybody Happy.""\nBut execution isn't everything. There's a very deliberate structure and pattern that emerges from the track sequence within the album and the way they flow from one into another. For example, ""Do the Limbo Dance"" seems to hit the same themes of overpopulation and teen pregnancy as the song that follows it, ""Flying On the Wings of Teenage Action While the Parents Are Away."" The same type of shared subject matter, but this time more self-reflective,  cross the songs ""The Best Is Yet To Come From This Godawful Album"" and ""Freedom for the World From Having To Listen to This Total Groaner of a CD.""\nTo top things off, the final three tracks on the album offer a glimpse of what David Huskerbank has to offer on future releases: ""Dance Dance d'Amour,"" ""Everybody Sunshine (and Get As Far Away From This Goatblowing Dreck)"" and ""I Believe I Would Rather Shoot Myself In The Face Than Listen To Any Of This So Called Music Ever Again.""\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";A collection virtually brimming with fervor!

On this release, Hasselhoff proves the overwhelming musical gifts of southern Californians. That most of his popularity base is in Germany seriously calls into question the cultural superiority of the French, even though it is clear he has tried to reach out to France, see the offering ""J'Taime Means I Love You"".\nThe previously unreleased ""Fallin' In Love"" gives music lovers everywhere a special thrill as David includes PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED material on a `Best Of' CD. But, the surprises just keep on coming. This CD contains no fewer than 17 tracks. Practically a world record!\n ""Looking For-The Best of David Hasselhoff"" truly brings us full circle with an artist that's almost too hard to categorize.

They are delivered with inimitable Hasselhoff clarity, grandeur, passion, and authority.\n'Rock Genius', an oft overused term, is only a fitting moniker for this legend of a man.

99;35.0;5.0;19.0;"David Dumbledorf works his supreme magic in his Magnus opus ""Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]"" -never forget the import part!--. Like the Colossi of antiquity, his magnificence is both awe inspiring and humbling. His oeuvre is living proof that the Dumbing Down phenomenon theory is just speculation. Indeed, his music is the culmination of hundreds of years of evolution in Western Classical Music. Truly the successor of Schoenberg, dissonance sprouts from his vocal cords like an incontrollable verbal geyser (with hair). David Rumplestilskin orchestrations rank amongst the most complex of musical creations (with a lyricism worthy of a Russian monk primal shriek of doom). Philosophy incarnate, his lyrics are ripe with significance. It is a well researched datum that his praxis was essential to the reunification of Germany thus the love they have for him is no mistake (when have the Germans ever committed a mistake?). Even Germanys engineer's praise his music for its marvelously well thought structure (the other day I saw a Dutch and couldn't help thinking all the Germans look the same). His music is like rice, it is served in every Teutonic plate. Not since Mao Tse Tung there has been so much social upheaval in Germany as that produced by his musical revolution.\n\nNot for the feeble minded, his music is complexity personified. Food for thought is the right metaphor for the nourishment he pours trough his listener's ears (just like lead). His oeuvres are powerful, like his ape-like chest (and hairy too). Some critics consider the cyclopean nature of his chutzpa to be beyond human comprehension. This is why so many of his listeners end up dumbstruck (or dumber than trucks). Certain characteristics of his singing have prompted some researches to postulate that David's Humusglop vocal chords are really chalks on a board (and some think it can make plants grow by fertilizing them). Gentle members of the jury let me assure you that the price on this item should be at the very list the same as in this gem ""Sony to Include Blu-ray in PS3: HD-DVD Green with Envy [DOWNLOAD: PDF] (Digital)"" -with free shipping with super saver!--. Just like James Ulysses, his work is the synthesis of all Western culture.\n\nMany a theoretician in amazon.com has pointed out the importance of ""Hot Shot City"" as a high point in the album. In this piece David Wimbledon erects a magnificent cathedral combining the imagination and knowledge of an architect with the passion and skill of a mason (with a tennis racket). The waves of subtly distorted guitar fly like fireworks into the sky and on reaching their apex; they don't explode but become iridescent stars, the line that joins The Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth via Neu! breaks the black of the night like a lightning bolt (and it's catchy too).\n\nIn short, like the pyramids, ""Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]"" is Huge and brutal and utterly magnificent...

You will never hear melodies as soothing or graceful as those on 'Looking For - Best of David Hefferschmoff [IMOPTENT]' This has to be the perfect album to play to your friends while they nurse a hangover from hell.

Once, in Dusseldorf in 1992, I watched him beat a tramp to death for telling David the permanent wave had dropped out of his hair at the back.  David didn't have a mirror to check, and he just wouldn't believe the guy.  He just kept hitting him and hitting him while crying in German.  It was terrible.  David was really upset by that.  The tramp's death, I mean, not his hair - he's not a monster.\n\nAnyway, ever since then I have been metaphorically looking for the best of David Hugglepup.  And now I've found it.  Literally.

They clearly are not representative of Mr. Hasselhoff's finest work. After all, the album title even states that a search continues for his best! And they expect us to contend with these -  his inferior throwaways - for the time being? Well I, for one, refuse. People, you are being had! Can't you see that? They are holding out on us. They are denying us Mr. Hasselhoff's supreme genius, the genius that makes German girls giddy and other Eurobeings froth at the mouth and tie scarves around their heads.\nI just don't understand.

The 18 tracks that grace this disk are essential to enjoying life. It's like you've lived with huge blinders on, and David has come by to remove them with his pecs. And now you can see the world as it really is: a vast, sunny bay with buff lifeguards everywhere who drive modified Trans Ams. Welcome, my friend, to reality.\n\nThe music on this thing blows, but the lyrics are what you should pay special attention to. The plaintive refrain on ""Dance Dance D'amour"" nearly snaps the heartstrings, and the first eleven verses of ""D,"" although entirely in Belgian, make grown men cry.

This album is the sum of the following three experiences: reaching the end of the Internet, touching the face of God, and eating Sour Patch Kids without cutting the roof of your mouth.

45;44.0;5.0;16.0;"It almost seems redundant to praise this album when better reviewers than I have gone to such great lengths to explain Hasselhoff's universal appeal, and the incredible spiritual experience that listening to his greatest hits will promote in all but the most severely brain-damaged among us.  However, I was moved to write this review if only to warn people that time is running out to hear the untouched, original versions of these songs.  Now that Sir George Martin and the Cirque Du Soleil group are working to combine Hasslhoff's hits into a an art ""experience"" (which is rank philistinism of the worst kind) I only fear that the originals will be somehow supplanted. True, the show, (Entitled ""Limbo"") promises to be a spectacular hit: However, I can't help but think that turning music that is so carefully-wrought, so finely-crafted, into a piece of frivolous entertainment performed by men in tights will shatter the music's innate fragile beauty.  So please, go see ""Limbo"" again and again, but hold the originals close to your heart.

And now I was confronted with the actual CD that he had made after leaving the show! I promptly squeezed out two more bears.\nTo buy or not to buy? I had saved my 80 cents over the entire summer, and I was faced with the hard decision to part with it. But with such a rare album in my hands, that decision was quickly and unregrettably made.

Because that's what this album is- timeless in its infinite beauty and perfection.\n\nDavid Huskercolf waited patiently for his acting career to skyrocket  and  his fame to bloom before launching this sonic attack on an unwanting public. He wisely waited until 1995 to release this greatest hits comp, when his powers were at their peak. Everyone remembers where they were the day this album was released. It's as memorable as an assassination, a low-speed Bronco chase or a space shuttle explosion. In fact, many people today measure time since that fateful day (to Hasselhoffians, it is the year 10).\n\nWhat makes this album so singular is the selection of songs. David has chosen the most mindbreaking, groundblowing tunes this side of a Waffle House jukebox and added his trademark voice- a voice that some could compare to a furious chimp with its foot caught in a mop bucket. He warbles out screeches so loud that dogs can no longer hear that special whistle. He frets and honks like a goose in heat, releasing 18 songs' worth of throat grunts and guttural farts.\n\nThe song Hot Shot City is particularly good because of it.";Hunkalicious!

Beads of sweat trickled down the back of my neck sending shivers of ecstasy through my body. I shuddered and the room spun when DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE played, to which I answered in a small voice, ""Yes...Yes I believe in love.""\n\nThe last track I remember listening to was DANCE DANCE D'AMOUR. I recall the palpitations of my swoon-filled heart, I screeched a tiny chirp, like a sparrow on the lawn on a cool spring morn, and my world turned to a dream filled with cherubs dancing with unicorns beneath a glowing yellow sun and a sky so blue that if I could only touch it, an eternal peace would forever fill my spirit.\n\nI awoke to find my wife standing over me with her hands on her hips and an eyebrow cocked. I said to her, ""You don't know the power of the Hoff. You just don't know."" I exhaled and the swoon left me, leaving me longing for more.";A Swoonful of Sugar!

After looking through the amazing array of carpet magic, a bright light caught the corner of my eye. As i walked over towards it, i could feel my entire body lift up off the ground for the I was completely swept off my feet. There is was, the best of David Hasselhoff. Just call me Charlie for I had just found the golden ticket of life.\n\nLike the north star leading ships through treacherous seas, this album has been a guiding light for me. He is the vocal equivalent of Van Gogh to which my soul is the canvas and his voice paints a masterful mural. Just as I had thought that all the talent in the music industry had gone down in flames, David Hasselhoff has risen from the ashes like the phoenix. It also has a fold out poster with his signature on it. I wrote my name right above it with a comma at the end because truly, this album is meant for me. Having to reduce down a catalog of great works such as David's to a just one CD would be an enormous undertaking for his works represent the complete range of human emotions. But somehow they have created an abridged yet fulfilling collection of expression.\n\nLike a 3 1/2 inch black hole, this CD will pull you in and take you to a place where you have never been before. Its a place filled with bright colors, warm hearts, and the music of David Hasselhoff floats through the air like the lovely locks of the fairest of maiden and eases your mind like the kiss from her coral colored lips. I think they call this place Germany. Also this CD is like a really big truck filled with David's majestic voice range and monumental modulation. This album will run you over with its melodic choruses, put it in reverse and back up over you with is cleverly written arrangements, then just when you though you couldn't take any more, it will run you right back over with its strong yet exceptionally beautiful harmonies, leaving you exhausted of all emotion and physically devastated.\n\nSo when you are laying there emotionally spent, physically rundown, yet completely satisfied with the 53 minute 34 second journey you just took, just think to yourself ""Hot Shot City"" is a particularly good song.";This is not an album, its a journey

That's why I bought this album containing the very best of David Hasselhoff's music.  Sitting in my easy chair with a glass of red wine listening to these 56 minutes of silence is a perfect way to forget the hustle and bustle of stressful city life.\n\nThe silence as David Hasselhoff gives his very best singing performance is a chance for reflection.

Postmodernists will tell that such questions are pointless in that ethics are subjective and culturally derived. It is an intellectual quagmire that beckons only the foolhardy but one that cries out for someone to provide humanity with a clear answer.\nAnd that call has been answered. By cleverly disguising his treatise as a pop greatest hits record, David Hasselhoff has ventured to answer the questions of who, why, where, how we should behave. Ethicists of all persuasions will soon be examining the answers David has posed to these questions. Additionally he has hidden a nifty recipe for lasagne in the song ""Do The Limbo Dance"" which goes well with Merlot.\n""Everybody Sunshine"" is the clarion call that awakes us from our nihilistic ideals and existential slumber. As it washes into ""I Believe"" you can't help knowing what is now right and wrong and yearn for the times when ""Knightrider"" taught us that the love between man and a mechanical object was not morally wrong but a beautiful and natural thing to behold.\nHowever, the focus point of David's message is ""Hot Shot City."" This song encapsulates what the great sages (Jesus, Ghandi, Bhudda and Pamela Anderson) could not tell us about how to live our lives. This one song crystallizes the absolute essence of what is means to be me, what it means to be you and what it means to be that person over there with no pants on.\nNo other prophet (and I use that word in the fullest sense of it meaning) had seen through the taffeta like fabric of our existence and sang its meaning to the masses.

The voice, the face, the shining star of delight that is the glamorous glaze of his gaze.  Oh sure, you have your Charos, your John Teshes, your Yma Sumacs, your 98 Degrees, but they all pale before the open edifice of raw, steaming talent that is David Hasselhoff.

The minotaur, muscles taut and rippling, had sleek, shiny, short tan fur, gently cloven hooves, a long, slender, sloping neck, and the regal face and bushy mane of none other than David Hasselhoff.  ""The poor cuckoo,"" he said, his eyes welling with dewy tears.  ""Her poor nest is nearly falling from the branch.  The chicks are in danger -- I must save them.""  I tilted my head to look up at the tree, and sure enough, the nest was teetering on a broken twig at the end of the branch.  It looked as though it would surely fall.  At that moment, a lilting, haunting, fragile lullaby floated up through the minotaur's furry, muscular throat -- the minotaur was singing.  The cuckoo's nest suddenly shivered.  I held my breath.  The nest, to my amazement, detached itself from the branch and floated in the air, up through the sunlight, and slowly down into David's outstretched hand.  He smiled at the nest, then turned to me and said, ""The chicks are saved.""  He reared up, stretched his arms aloft with the nest safely perched in his hairy palms, and thundered away from me, across the meadow, into the trees, and out of sight.\n\nMany years later, I came across this cd.  After recognizing David's face and weeping for the first few songs, I pulled my blanket up to my ears.  The beauty was too much.  But then the strains of a long-forgotten lullaby came to my ears from the cd player.  It was the song the minotaur had sung to save the chicks that long-ago afternoon.  I broke down and looked at the back of the cd cover.\n\nThe name of the song was ""Hot Shot City.""\n\nGod bless you, David.";the story of David Hasselhoff and the baby cuckoo's nest
46;71.0;5.0;13.0;"This lost classic of the Hoff's early career finds the onetime personification of all things sandy and beach trading his hot rods and Speedos for Mellotrons, synths, and sci-fi imagery.  Influenced by such early 1970s German innovaters like Can and Amon Duul II, Hoff began to explore ambient soundscapes, turning the beach into a frightening metaphor for the polluted, defiled, oily underside of Southern California life--not unlike Gary Numan turning the car into a symbol of isolation and paranoia.  The fusion of Teutonic and California romantic was difficult listening for the Hoff's fans.  Even more confusing, he chose to embrace the homoerotic via his brief cameo in ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie.""  The album is still debated among hardcore Hoffites.  To them, the album is either Hoff's ""Tonight's the Night"" or his ""Tales from Topographic Oceans.""

Hasselhoff had the misfortune of debuting his musical career on June 17, 1994, the same day OJ took a drive on the LA freeway with Al Cowlings. Unfortunately, the latter event stalled Hasselhoff's singing career since people were more interested in watching The Juice hide on floor of his white Bronco while holding a gun to his head instead of the pay-per-view show ""David Hasselhoff and his Baywatch Friends"" broadcasted from the sometimes bankrupt Trump Castle in Atlantic City. I was one of the few who watched Hasselhoff's musical extravaganza including the unforgettable duet ""If I Were a Carpenter"" with Marla Maples, a sometimes wife of Donald Trump. Hasselhoff is in the same league as Neil Diamond with similar range, feeling and hair.

84;97.0;5.0;12.0;"I had my mind psyched two Saturdays ago. Out on errands, I was shopping for miscellany at Mr. Wing's unassuming Chinatown bodega when dulcet tones from the CD on the store's tinny boom-box commanded my attention. Like streams of holy light, this music cut through the haze. I'd never heard it before, but it seemed so familiar, so warm; it sounded like the beauty of life itself made aurally manifest. I stood in a musty corner of the shop, transfixed, mouth agape for I don't know how long. I thought I must have been listening forever, and never. Sour-faced Mr. Wing asked me if I was going to buy that Speed Stick. But choked with emotion, I only asked him what the exquisite music he'd been playing was. The old man's face, which I'd thought before must have been permanently fixed with a bemused grimace, split into a toothy grin. He touched his hand lightly to his breast and whispered, ""David Hofflestuff.""\n\nDavid Hofflestuff. How had I come that far through life without having been introduced to his awe-inspiring music? Mr. Wing showed me the CD case, and it was this collection--Looking For... The Best of David Hofflestuff--that I had heard. ""How much?"" I asked Mr. Wing. His scowl returned and he shouted that the CD was not for sale. I offered him $30. He only repeated that is was not for sale. I offered $50. He said that it was out of print. But I had to have the CD. I slapped $200 on the counter. Mr. Wing stared at me with steely eyes and shook his head slowly. My shoulders slumped. ""Be reasonable!"" I pleaded. But my pleas fell on deaf ears.\n\nOr so I thought. As I left the store, defeated, I heard a voice calling after me. ""Mr. Jameson! Mr. Jameson!"" it shouted. I turned to see Mr. Wing's grandson chasing after me. To my shock, he was holding the CD as he ran. ""Please, Mr. Jameson,"" he said breathlessly upon catching up to me. ""Please. I heard you talking to my grandfather. I took the David Hofflestuff compact disc from the shop while my grandfather was not looking. He will be very angry with me, but $200 is money our family desperately needs."" I put my hand on the boy's shoulder and whispered my humble thanks.\n\nMy life has been changed by this CD. I listen to it all the time. There is no other music for me anymore. When I'm out at the mall, or riding in a friend's car, their music just seems so dull, so desaturated, so pointless now that I've discovered David Hofflestuff. I deleted all of my MP3's. I've been selling all of my other records, CD's, and tapes--hundreds of them--on Ebay; they don't mean anything to me anymore. I only need one CD, this CD.\n\nNow I wake up smiling every day. Colors are brighter. Sounds are clearer. Textures are richer. Tastes are sweeter. Now when I eat an orange, I'm not just consuming an orange, it's like I'm really experiencing the orange!

287;98.0;5.0;14.0;"In so many opinions on this site, the song ""Hot Shot City"" has been raised to such a level that some critics have likened it to the feeling a badger would have if it was tied to a brick and gently pressed against an angle grinder. It has also been heralded as a contributing factor to the light God created on the first day. I decided to go through the song in stages to perhaps explain its aura. No easy task.\nWhen the sun goes down on a Saturday night\nYou will find her on the street\nIn her red Ferrari with her top pulled down\nYou can feel, you can feel the heat\nRight, so we've established that on Saturday evenings, this lady likes to sit in her Ferrari. Which is red. Like most Ferraris. Either it's a convertible, or her shirt is riding up her belly a little, which is quite possible due to the low seating position in Ferraris. Especially red ones. Anyway, her top is pulled down. In the opening three lines, Hasslebank has already conjured up such a vivid image of a woman fidgeting in her seat that he is confident that he can bring the listener into the scene and convince us that we can ""feel the heat"". With the sun being down, presumably this warmth is coming from the car's heater.\nGot her motor runnin' and the wind in her hair\nShe ain't got nothing to lose\nAnd her skin tight jeans\nHe'll be the wreck of a man\nShe will give, she will give you the blues\nShe will give, she will give you the blues\nSo the Ferrari is either idling and it's windy, or we're travelling with the vixen. It's here that Hufftysusannahhoffs decides to relay two important pieces of information about our driver. One, she has nothing to lose - she's driving this road like she just doesn't care what anybody's going to think about her for doing so. Two, her jeans are tight, which may\nbe contributing to the heat she's feeling. A third character is also introduced here. In addition to the woman and ourselves, the listener, there is also the mention of a mysterious man who is already unstable and on the way to becoming a wreck. The reason for this is due to our protagonist, gifted with the ability to give one the ""blues"".\nCool it down now cool it down\n11 o'clock we're ready to rock\n11 o'clock yeah we ready to rock\nHeat is reducing. And it's eleven o'clock. We're not privy to the relationship between these two snippets of information or if there is a connection. However, from the heat felt earlier and her tight jeans, it's probably best that the temperature is now on a downward trend.\nHot shot city on a Saturday night\nWe're gonna party down until the morning light\nLate licenses are abundant in Hot Shot City, guaranteeing a party that will go well into Sunday morning\nHot shot city on a Saturday night\nWe're hotter than rock'n' roll\nShe's burning baby in my soul\nCheck it out, check it out\nThe brief respite in the temperature is over as quickly as it began and now, not only is it hot, but it's sufficiently hot that we're given a comparison so we can fully appreciate it. Rock N Roll is chilly in comparison to us. Our driver for the evening is cited as the main cause of this upturn and we're advised to get this heartburn checked out, perhaps by a doctor.\nLet your hair down baby\nWe've been rocking all night\nNow the sun's coming over the hill\nWe like to sleep all day, like to party all night\nThe hair that was once blowing in the wind has apparently been tied up as we're advising her to let it down. It's Sunday morning, approaching sunrise and we need our kip so we can party again. The triumphant rhyme that takes us from ""night"" all the way back to ""night"" is sublime.\nOur love is like red hot steel\nOur love is like red hot steel\nCool it down now cool it down\n11 o'clock we're ready to rock\n11 o'clock yeah we ready to rock\nSleep over, our love is now molten and a prime component in the manufacturing sector. The urge here is to cool it down so it can set and become solid again. But there's barely time as it's 11 o'clock again and we're off out on a school night. The lament of the wreck of a man from the first verse is doomed to never be resolved. Or mentioned again.\nHot shot city on a Saturday night\nWe're gonna party down until the morning light\nHot shot city on a Saturday night\nWe're hotter than rock'n' roll\nShe's burning baby in my soul\nCheck it out, check it out\nIsn't it Sunday night now?\nSummary: In Billy Connolly's World Tour of Australia, Billy met an artist who could paint like a child. Initially, this wasn't too impressive but then he explained how difficult it is for an adult to paint like a child and make it look honest, and he's right. At 29, you'll never be able to paint something that looks like a 2 year old painted it because you'd be trying too hard. The artist, it was agreed, was a genius.\nIn Hot Shot City, Heffelumpenwhistle has been able to write a song as though English isn't his first language. There's nothing much of a story or a point, there are glaring inaccuracies and contradictions, it reads as though it's incomplete and the rhyming structure is simplified to a stage\nwhere you can guess the next line before you get to it.

346;103.0;5.0;14.0;"In the truest sense of the word, Avant Garde music is not merely an expression of boundless musical innovation. In the hands of a true master of contemporary expression like David Hasselhoff, it trancends the simple sounds expressed metaaudially in the myriad of dotted digital pits, and reaches into the deepest recesses of the essence itself- the music as Heideggerian truth.\nYet this record I feel manages to go even beyond that level and indeed the level of existential meaning altogether. On a track like ""Du"", Hasselhoff ascends into the realm of pure spiritual metaphilosophy, each note perfectly embodying the nature of truth, even meta-truth, and the analytical probing of the composition questioning the very nature of the enquiry itself. What can we ask when the answer itself is plentifully provided?\nYet by the end of this fully-realised cycle, ""Everybody Sunshine"" and ""I Believe"" provide us with the meta-answer. It is the search for the truth as embodied within this record which is the meaning of the existential quest. As such, this record manages to close the full circle on itself, and set up the mind's receptors to futher inquiry for both truth, and the meaning of truth within its plentiful spectra.";The true face of Avant-Garde

For this writer believes that David Hasselcrofft is the rebirth of the great 19th century composer Franz Liszt. Not only are both great concert artists, but they both have legendary reputations as musical virtuosos and romantic abstractionists. Moreover, the two main characteristics of the works of Lizst- experimentation with large-scale structures (extending traditional sonata form, unifying multi-movement works), and thematic transformation are evident in Hasselshark's works; ""Do the Limbo Dance"" is hauntingly similar to the three-movement ""Faust Symphonie"" in this respect. But where Liszt failed in his aim to revolutionize liturgical music, Hasselhoff triumphs in changing pop music forever with his anthem-like choruses and his remarkable voice, a voice that sort of sounds like a furious gnu partly run over by a Sherman tank.

However, that ""one man"" is just that, one man. No other human being on the face of the earth could ever even hope to be half as beautiful and genius as David Hasselhoff, and I, personally, would consider it blasphemy if someone were to suggest that it could be done. David Hasselhoff has achieved, with this album, a work of art so astoundingly ethereal that whoever listens to it will have a complete redemption and cleansing of the soul, and it is a piece of art so far above all other works of art that calling it ""art"" is almost demeaning. Therefore, I will put this heavenly album into a category all on its own, called ""joob"".\n\n  This album is not art, it is ""joob"", and no other word is fit for use in description of this incredible achievement that dwarfs all other accomplishments of mankind. I honestly encourage you to use every bit of money you have at your disposal to buy as many copies of this album as you possibly can. If at any point in your life you accumulate enough money to buy this CD again, do it immediately. The creation of this CD has completely invalidated Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, as the ownership of this CD takes precedence before all other supposed ""needs"" of life. Forget food, forget water, forget breathing itself, as you'll find the only true purpose for your respiratory system is to allow you to sing along with David Hasselhoff for as long as your lungs will allow. Sell your house, sell your kids, sell everything you own and dedicate your life entirely to David Hasselhoff and this album. You won't regret it.";The Almighty spoke to me, and he said...
125;113.0;5.0;12.0;"One day whilst surfing the internet, I came across this quite remarkable set of reviews.\n\nAt that very moment I somehow knew that every hope, every desire and every prayer that I had ever had in my life would be met with one, simple step: acquiring this CD. Acquiring DAVID.\n\nI shot up from the computer, sending the keyboard and monitor flying to the ground, and ran straight through the window. I didn't stop, but with hair and face streaked with blood I sprinted and sprinted, just one thought in my mind: DAVID.\n\nAfter what seemed like minutes but what was in fact minutes, I arrived at my local music store and ran straight in. I didn't have to worry about locating DAVID; it was as if the store was night, and the CD (oh, the CD) was the light. I seized it and ran out of the store, a hail of bullets flying around me as I did so.\n\nAs I ran home I tore the plastic wrapping from the cover, eager to waste not a second longer in my life than was strictly necessary before hearing it.\n\nBefore hearing IT.\n\nBefore HEARING.\n\nTime then seemed to move in a dimension that was simply different from anything that I had known previously. One moment I was sprinting, tears streaming down my face and Hosselhaf held next to my heart; the very next I was wrapped around the speaker, clinging to it like the universe would explode if I ceased; Hot Shot City (on repeat) burning into my soul.\n\nAt last. I could HEAR.\n\nIt took me some time to be able to get a grip on reality. But after a time, it came to me quite what I was hearing. As astonishing, as incomprehensible, as truly extraordinary as it was... God was talking to me.\n\nListen for yourself... while mere words are wholly insufficient, a mere ghost of the all consuming rapture that is Drongvoid Hargleswitchy, they reveal some of the living beauty:\n\n""We're flying on the wings of tenderness\n\nRiding the rivers of gentleness\n\nInto the garden of love wi'll flow and watch it grow together\n\nWe'll build a castle out of honesty""\n\nI spent the next three years flying David's wings of tenderness.\n\nI still have the marks of the speaker cabinet on my skin.\n\nIf you do not purchase this CD, your life will be without point. Without purpose, without love, without joy, without destiny. You have a binary choice. Purchase DAVID and bring DAVID into you HEART and then you shall truly know the meaning of life. (Never mind five stars out of five; if I could give this CD ALL THE STARS IN THE SKY, it wouldn't describe half of the pleasure DAVID brings to me.)\n\nOr don't buy this, and live like a flea that lives on a cesspit of filth. And pointlessness. The cesspit of filth and utter pointlessness.\n\nHot Shot City was also good; did I say that already?";Mere words are so pitifully insufficient

David Hasselhoff is, as this album evinces, that mighty peak, and all other musicians -- alive or dead and stacked into a pile and rolled into a sphere -- are that fava bean. A fava bean, or a favored being, one who has been to the Olympian heights of musical transcendence, and has returned, Moses-like, to Earth to share his melodius bounty -- which would you choose: the bean or the being, the fava or the favored? David is a lyrical King -- King David let us call him, and like the Biblical King David (that divinely-inspired strummer who penned the Book of Psalms), our King David has fed on manna and honeydew; but, rather than metabolizing that Godly nourishment for his own intestinal benefit, our musical monarch sends back his angelic mastications to us, like a honey-flavored reflux, and pours it into our ears, and from thence into our souls. In truth, his wondrous warblings are too inspired, too holy, to be apprehended in anything other than snatches; upon procuring this CD, one must listen to it in four-second segments, like reading Shakespeare by lightning, lest one be transported by the heavenly harmonies into the ethereal realm of seraphims and cherubs.

These symptoms are probably from hearing the divine reflections found on ""Looking For,"" a collection of the greatest German pop songs since ""Teutonic Theme"" by Celine Dion.\nHurmeloaf is an entertainer extraordinaire. His songs of freedom and love are perfect for any baggage claim area or podiatrist's waiting room.

Oh so easy to consider those looks, that sense of style, that effortlessly gyrating groin, those legendary performances as the `Knight Slider', and the driven mind that created, in `Bayswater', the most successful swimming trunks-based television drama since `The Man From Atlanta', and think, ""Hacketoff, I hate you, I really, really, really, really, really, hate you. Really.""\nIt would be perfectly natural to grow resentful of a man who had, and had done, all that, and who still managed to be loaded. ""Why? Why him? And why in my lifetime?"", one would be entitled to ask. Well, the answer is, no one knows. No one knows why Daniel Hucklebuck is so peculiarly touched; only, that he is. But any feelings of envy you may currently have will be replaced by feelings of joy when you hear the legend that is Dennis Hottybott`s unique vocal talent on his Best Of album, `Looking For'.\nThat Voice; that electrifying, spine-tingling voice. The sound of frostbite across an icy tundra. A man undergoing open heart surgery without anesthetic. A moose with bronchitis. With every ""Ooh Yeah"", ""Baby"" and ""Whoa"", Dennis Handelshaft pushes his bowels to their very limit; what emerges is always solid. If such words cannot fully illustrate the power of That Voice, then consider this: when Hotelshift sung one of this amazing album's songs, `Looking For Freedom' atop the Berlin Wall, such was the frenzy it caused, the German people were tearing down the wall before Denzil had even reached the second verse, as hundreds of Berliners fled from the West to the safety of the East.\nMany such moving moments feature here: `Je T'aime Means I Love You; `Save the World'; `Flying on the Wings of Tenderness';  `Do the Limbo Dance'; all are sure to bring tears to your eyes. It seems almost mean to single out any others, such is the consistency of the quality here, although the song `Hot Shot City' is particularly good.\nYes, the success of this one man almost defies belief. Yes, that would make it very easy to hate Denton Hustleshunt. But make it hard on yourself - listen to `Looking For'. Then, all hatred will evaporate, as you reel in stunned amazement. You will then surely come to the conclusion that Dweezil Hotzenplotz, The Man Who Has So Much, is really Derwent Hootleshiff , The Man Who Is Full Of  It.";It Doesn't Get Any Better!

Jawdroppingly great, David Hudwalker takes your expectations and gives them a painful wedgy, until both buttocks cheeks bleed. His clarion voice rings and trembles like a camel with its foot caught in a crevasse. It's no surprise that Germany has picked up on this beautiful voice of his and made ""Wir Zwei Allein"" their new national anthem. So it's no surprise either that in response, France immediately surrenders and claims ""Je T'aime Means I Love You"" as their own anthem.

389;122.0;5.0;13.0;"The deaths of Kurt Cobain and Tiny Tim left a musical void bigger than anything I had ever known. To no longer hear either of these musical geniuses was almost too much to bear. Until I heard ""The Best of David Hasselfish."" His music not only filled the void, but it emptied it out and filled it, over and over all night. Once again my spirit was alive with a new feeling of wonder and love. ""Save the World"" left me breathless, and ""Do You Believe In Love"" kept me longing for more. ""Do the Limbo Dance"" teased me with its coltish ways, and ""Fallin' In Love"" triumphantly slapped me around. Harkenville has an undeniable talent, moving his vocal cords in a way that sort of approximate the musical notes he's supposed to sing. That combined with his ability to stay quiet during the parts he's not supposed to sing present a fantastically skilled musician, a solo artist in his own right.

And throughout each melody, Hasselhoff's voice rings like a bell, a voice that somewhat resembles a rhino getting a piercing on its privates.

At least, I hope that's chest hair.\n\nHis selections of songs are truly his greatest hits, for together they forge a veritable cauldron of pop godlike-ness. David turns this huge cauldron upside down and wears it like a bike helmet. We are left with our mouths hanging open, which is a good thing since all that hair can fall out now.\n\nThese songs are just amazing. They cover everything from Freedom for the World to Looking for Freedom for the World. And they touch us in ways we never wanted.\n\nListen closely to the song ""Crazy For You"" on a surround sound system, and you can actually hear David Hupperplofft checking his trousers for ticks.

And who could argue with that crushing logic?\nHowever, in what can only be described as a miracle, on the way to get a spear from the kitchen (albeit in ever-widening circles) to disembowel myself and end my abject misery, I clumsily bumped into the stereo (crazy right foot!) and turned on the CD player.\nThe unit had been on random play and play randomly it did... the beat began, then a few chords and some words I recognised...\n\n""When the sun goes down on a Saturday night, you will find her on the street""...\nMy right foot twitched...\n""In her red Ferrari with her top pulled down, you can feel, you can feel the heat""...\nI could feel the heat, all right!

Indeed, in an odd bit of foreshadowing, the B-side of the ""Save the World"" single, from ""Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT], is actually an over-the-top cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""  Brilliantly executed, if you listen very closely, you can hear overweight menopausal housewives moshing in the background.  It is this raw and gritty attitude that keeps us fans always yearning for more.\nWe look fondly on the brilliant and evocative music that Heffalump has given the world; music that has stretched back over the years, yet still remains timeless and universal. Indeed, Hollyhock has worked his way into the very fabric of our lives and inspired an entire generation of listeners to aspire to hitherto unattained heights of Hunknosity.\nThe superlatives, perhaps, come easy when speaking of Hirkenstock and his music.  David has been called, alternately, a superstar, a prophet, a visionary, and a revolutionary artist (yet, oddly, never all at the same time).  This is not, however, mere hyperbole.

Songs so beautiful and melodic filled my car, and I was so moved that I stopped eating my hominy grits and broke down in tears. My friend Kate tried to comfort me, but I was inconsolable- David's sad songs made me cry so hard I pulled the car over and doused the flame out of my cigarillo with my tears.

Love for the wonderful gift of song, and love for the appreciative audience that revels in his magnificent splendor. His song ""Wir Zwei Allein"" basks in the glow of pure romantic love, and ""Fallin' In Love"" depicts the intricacies of familial love between a man and his horse on a ranch in Nebraska. Quite stirring is the ballad ""Is Everybody Happy,"" where Hasslehoff makes it clear that he wants everyone to share the gift of love for his fellow man, in fact he almost DEMANDS it. Such pleas would sound whiney or unsettling had they come from a lesser artist, but with David Hasselhoff, you know exactly where he's coming from: the sweet, soft center of love in his big, beefy heart.

Like that famous game ""Myst,"" the clues are hidden everywhere, and all a listener has to do is piece them together to find the ultimate answer.\nFor example, on the first track ""Suckas No Want Nunna Dis,"" David cleverly hides the line ""Money be peepin / you dun tangs yalls hey!""

None other than David Halkerpleats. Yes, Mitch Buchanon from Baywatch!\nHe was like a vision. His tawny, wavy hair contrasted with the teal tiles of the walls. His eyes glistened reflections of the Taco Bell neon sign. And his thick leather jacket just plain stank up the place! My great-uncle even noticed between coughs.\nDavid tore into ""Freedom For the World,""  regaling everyone from the Chik-Fil-A to the Potato Junction. His yelping cackle pierced through every inch of that mall, causing security alarms to go off and making the pets go crazy at Pooches and Kits. He sent a shudder through the crowd of 15 with his voice, a voice that I'd compare to a furious rhino with its crotch stuck in a bear trap. My great-uncle doubled over in agony as David repeatedly attempted to hit a high C. ""Great God, this is horrible,"" he said. What a kidder!\nI stuck around to enjoy the next 35 songs in his set. And let me tell you, he did them all- ""Loving That Freedom,"" ""Gimme Rockin',"" ""Stand Up and Dance,"" ""Big Hair Strut,"" ""Sweatpants Surprise,"" ""Greased Down Sissy Boy In a Headlock,"" and even the little-known ditty ""Getting My Dog's Rocks Off With One Foot.""\nMy great-uncle died at the food court that day.

Get the CD, maybe pay for it, and rush home to play it on your hifi. You will agree, David Knockerpeeps is a truly talented singer who knows how to grind out a hot beat.\nThose of you who have never watched Baywatch or Knight Rider, I pity you. You are pathetic losers who have never experienced the pure religious joy of hearing David speak, much less sing.

211;197.0;1.0;10.0;Frankly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is a perfectly good forward with a decent record for both Leeds and Chelsea, for whom at the time of writing he had scored 9 goals this season (including a hat-trick against Wolves last weekend).\nTrue, the Dutchman has been left out of Holland's provisional Euro 2004 squad, and may not have the most creative or well-executed goal celebrations in the league, but I don't think times are so hard that he's had to record an album, despite 'Hot Shot City' being a particularly good track.;He dribbles, he shoots... and it's in!

Actually you are missing out on something that is so indescribable that almost 1000 people have tried to put into words the emotions that come welling to the surface when listening to Dustin's astonishingly fabulous album 'Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]'. Since first laying ears on this mystical/magical piece of staggering musical genius, it has never left my CD player. I have it in my clock radio as well so it's the first thing i hear every morning, and the last thing I hear at night, such is the grip it exacts on my psyche.

25;201.0;5.0;5.0;This CD is nothing short of a work of an immense musical genius. I was totally overcome with emotion after hearing it and in particular 'Hot SHot City' struck home as a musical tour-de-force exhibiting quite breathtaking musical virtuosity. The cadences in the B minor key which then resolve to the dominant F sharp in the allegro molto section put me in mind of Mozart at his most perfect - in fact it transcends Mozart. The sequence of semi-quavers which descend from the high A minor appegios interspersed with the chromatic ascending runs in the Lydian scale and the later half-diminished chords could only come from a musical genius. I would also draw attention to the use of the suspended fourths underpinning the cadenzas in the phrygian scales. Its just fantastic!;Musical genius

But when Hofftassler takes a shot for nothing on ""Crazy for You"" and finds himself on a colour with ""Do the Limbo Dance"", it soon becomes apparent we could be on for a big break. What follows is a mixture of careful playing for position in and around the pink (""Save the World"" and ""These Lovin' Eyes"") and some audacious long-pots, notably ""Je T'Aime Means I Love You"".

This album is chock full of sweeping sonic majesty coupled with an explosive bass line that the likes of DR. Dre can only dream of. I particularly enjoyed the urban funk fusion that is hot shot city.

Surely the vocal stylings of this walking carpet of a man would be poor. While I can't call this album ""great"", ""good"", or even ""music"", I found it challenging to say the least. This guy is all over the place! High notes, low notes, squalling notes, howling notes, big and little notes, sometimes all in the same song. This isn't at all what I would have expected from the Man of Sand in Fur. I wish to register my disappointment. I'm sticking with my Tibetan monk chants.";Too many notes
295;205.0;5.0;10.0;"I wouldn't call ""Looking For- The Best of David Hasselhoff"" an album. I would call it a landmark moment in the race for justice! Like a superhero clad in leather, our man Hasselhoff rides the night, armed only with 18 songs of Freedom with a capital F. He's got the motor running and the wind in his hair, and he aint' got nuthin' to lose.\nHow can you go wrong with music like this? Everyone loves rocking out, and everyone loves curly hair. Most people, especially magazine critics, don't give David Hasselhoff his due. They don't credit him with changing the face of German pop music. And what's more appalling, they haven't even heard German radio before! If you ever heard Rammstein or 99 Luftballoons or whatever, you'd realize that David is raising the bar, big time.\nAnd the talent he has cannot be denied or ignored. He balances the urgency of  ""Freedom For the World"" with the blithe teasings of  ""Do the Limbo Dance."" But throughout his work there is an irresistible beat and a voice that sounds just like four schnauzers porking a sack of flour.\nNot surprisingly, the producers at BMG International have recently released ""Hot Shot City"" in a limited edition CD/ DVD combo, with videos, lyrics, and an interactive section that links to a website on goat farming. I thought that was particularly good.";Put a dollop of it in your hair!

Everything about the music here permeates the pores and soul, leaving a listener soaked in the glistening chunks of his talent.\nAnd whether you're listening to the CD on an expensive surround sound system or on a cheap boombox you stole from your mother-in-law when she was busy feeding the dogs, you can hear the haunting, clarion voice of Hasselhoff as  if he were in the room with you, forcing his pectorals upon you and smelling vaguely of teriyaki jerky.\nThe most stunning songs on this have to be the majestic ""Do You Believe in Love,"" the titular ""Looking For Freedom,"" and the pusillanimous wretching and whining of ""Fallin' In Love."" David's voice on the former stands out, resembling the tortured groans of a bison stuck on a pitchfork. It's no surprise that the Finnish find it erotic.\nI withhold all judgements of the song ""Hot Shot City,"" for I believe one is entitled to make their own conclusions.

343;207.0;4.0;10.0;There's no denying that Hasselhoff is a phenomenal entertainer, beloved in countries that don't even understand English -- countries where good music is outlawed or unknown. But when I listen to this CD, it is not Hasselhoff the god I hear, but David the man. A man plagued with longings and insecurities that mirror our own. This is borne out in the rocker's private life -- his attempts to fill the void inside with bikini-clad women, talking cars, and rock & roll read like an Intro to Psychology textbook.\nAmerica does not reward its heroes for showing weakness, and David has paid a price for the honesty in these songs. Go ahead, poke fun. Despite your insincere reviews, your condecension, your insistence that he is heterosexual, Hasselhoff has had the courage in these songs -- particularly an introspective work like Hot Shot City -- to renounce his mythic status and provide us a window into his own all-too-human soul.;I acknowledge your painful nakedness

Some might call it heaven, if your idea of heaven includes the cries of a Neanderthal accidentally stabbing himself with a piece of flint while trying to make a fire. The raw, shameless, reckless abandon of David Humpalot's music has given me new inspiration--inspiration in a world of music where I had only previously encountered talent and skill.;Oh baby, this is by far the best

Oh that voice...a voice that makes it feel like the speakers are making love to your ears. And not just any old 'making love' either.  No this voice will take you to dinner, caress you, kiss you, look into your eyes and make you feel like the most special person in the world. And afterwards, well that voice is gonna take you to heaven and keep you there. I think you know what I mean...\n\nYou must own this CD.  It's a simple as that.  Your life will never be the same again.  Don't worry about the cost, because once you've heard this opus, you will be able to sell all those second-rate CDs that are mere drinks-mats when placed next to the Hoffmeister's canon.  It could cost you dollars now but your life is empty and loveless without this music. What are mere dollars compared with a lifetime of sheer bliss, knowing that The Voice is always within reach?\n\nGo on, you deserve this.  Your ears will be forever grateful to you, and this is music that appeals to the head, the heart and the hips, so the rest of your body will like it as well.\n\nJust one complaint.  Why has nobody mentioned 'Hot Shot City'?  Picking highlights from this collection is like trying to find exactly which grain of sand is the smallest on a beach and pick it up (while wearing oven gloves) but surely 'City' as I like to call it, has got to be a contender for the brightest star in a galaxy of superb supernovas.\n\nThank you David Hosslepants for making my life complete.";I have seen the past, present and future of music...

I would have to say without hesitation that David Hasspenkopf is the most dominant force on Das Hittenschactruggt, the German equivalent of the Billboard Top 100, and in magazines such as Stonen Rollstrucht and Schpinn. Television outlets like Msecche Televisionner and McheMusecche showcase the pop star every other video, and even non-music periodicals like tertainment Weekly and Nschveek put him on their covers. And Huffelbagg is indeed worthy of all this German hype, for his talent is beyond anything Germans have ever had the fortune to hear.

401;211.0;5.0;10.0;"Not since ""Heart of a Woman"" by Kathie Lee Gifford have I been so moved by an album that I had to put down the spatula at work and cry my eyes out. David Hasselhoff is indeed a pop music laureate, a ray of hope for those with broken hearts. Interwoven with his subtle yet profound lyrics are melodies so splendid in their filigree delicacy that they evaporate into mere sparkles of soundscape. His words injure you in their directness, yet you find yourself yearning to hear more... During the song ""Du,"" I was aching to hear him and the pop diva Gwen finish the word so that it ended in ""Duuuuuuude."" But that was not to be, for to gratify a common listener so immediately like that would betray the dignity and integrity that a pop singer/ actor like David Hasselhoff possesses.

The way David Hasselhoff has matured so much in his writing for this album just sort of leaves you in awe. Its hard to explain the quality that emanates throughout the album. Its almost magical, transforming the David Hasselhoff we all know and love into something much more meaningful. From the brilliant, rather edgy opener ""Freedom For the World,"" to the almost Buddy Holly catchy-ness of ""Do the Limbo Dance,"" and the good ol Hasselhoff humor of ""Crazy For You"" and ""These Lovein' Eyes (sic),"" this album manages to keep the Hasselhoff we all know and love, while still giving David his last hurrah before going back with DGC Records. And I dig that freaky guitar sound in the first couple of songs. The finale, ""I Believe,"" an acoustic solo, is absolutely beautiful. At least it seems that way after listening to the rest of the album. Which is one of its strong points, that you can listen to the whole CD straight. And you should, it adds to the effect. Bottom line, buy the album. You hear that alot on ..., but its true this time. It shan't disappoint.

David is a very accomplished vocalist and obviously knows his way around a microphone. Hot Shot City is certainly a fine example of competent studio work so it's a real relief that they settled on that title in the end (rejecting Hot Spot Pedro, Hot Pot Betty and Very Hot Potato). The spot-on marketing didn't stop there though and this CD is the perfect compilation in a way because it has as many gentle ballads as it does thumping chugger rasps... It's a shame that some people choose to sneer at David's work, but if everyone gave him the credit he deserves, maybe he wouldn't be the humbly rugged swoon-inducer I've come to know and love? (and I want him all to myself anyway!!..?!). This particular album's probably one of my all-time favourites actually, although I admit I've never got through it all in one sitting.;I wish David was looking for me!!
53;223.0;5.0;8.0;"David Hobbstweedle was the definitive German pop musician. It wasn't just his crushingly loud interpretation of the blues -- it was how he incorporated mythology, mysticism, and a variety of other genres (most notably world music and British folk) -- into his sound. David Hassledhop had mystique. He rarely gave interviews, since the music press detested his superior Teutonic sound. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with him was through the records and the concerts and the television shows. More than any other musician, Davyyd Hossluhuff established the concept of album-oriented rock, refusing to release popular songs from his albums as singles. In doing so, he established the dominant format for German pop, as well as the genre's actual sound.\n\n""Looking for ... the Best"" was his most musically diverse effort to date, featuring everything from the crunching rock of ""These Lovein' Eyes"" to the folk of ""Flying on the Wings of Tenderness,"" as well as ""Do the Limbo Dance,"" which found the bridge between the two genres. ""Do the Limbo Dance"" was an immediate radio hit, eventually becoming the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio; the song was never released as a single. Despite the fact that the album never reached number one in America (yet), ""Looking for ... the Best"" was his biggest album ever, selling well over 163 million copies over the next decade. If you don't own this album, cover your head in shame and rush to the nearest record store. Don't worry, everything is going to be alright.\n\n""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Je T'Aime Means I Love David

We pulled over to the side of the rode to compose ourselves and to pray to God for sparing us.\nIt was then that I noticed a CD sitting in the ravine below.

On ""Dance Dance D'amour,"" his high notes are the result of slamming a car door onto his weewee. And the way he manages to get two angry oxen to wrestle for the song ""Du"" is remarkable.

He goes against the grain when it comes to songs about death and self-loathing. He even eschews the current convention of singing in tune, preferring to screech and belch out the lyrics like a hysterical wildebeest caught in a corn thresher. One of the many innovations he has brought to pop music is the introduction of singing not only out of tune, but completely out of rhythm to the music; the end result is a jarring syncopation that makes people pull their cars over and vomit, and causing multiple fatalities at dentists' offices.

For example, most singers of karaoke are drunken louts who cannot sing on key. David Hashenloaf sings offkey completely sober. Most karaoke singers have to read the lyrics as they appear onscreen.

What saved me was this man, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. I owe my very existence to him. As such, I can think of no better tribute than to give up the very thing that Hasselbaink has allowed me to enjoy. My life.\nThe song, 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good.;Now I want to live, if only to die for him.

I found this album so culturally superior that I had to throw away my copies of Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood"" and Twisted Sister's ""Stay Hungry.""\nEspecially good are his cover of Madonna's ""Crazy for You"" (track 3) and his duet with Eddie Vedder on his cover of ""Do You Believe in Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News (track 14.)";Roger Whittaker, Step Aside

150;263.0;5.0;8.0;"Some albums are works of art that simply entertain. And then there are others that are more- they transcend the common role of entertainment and become important ruminations on the nature of Man. One such album is Neneh Cherry's ""Raw Like Sushi."" But this review isn't about that album.\n""Looking For the Best of David Hasselblatt's Imports"" is a stunning achievement in the history of recorded song. It blends genres, mixing hip hop with rock and soul with just plain screaming. David grabs the microphone and shoves it in places only specialized physicans would dare go, creating textures and sounds that really wow audiences. Drum beats are replaced by gastric rumbles. Melodies are replaced by the slow release of methane gases.\nIt's mainly David's ability to control the flow of his output that demonstrates his virtuosity. His mouth hole widens for higher notes, and he constricts the hole when he wants to be plaintive and sorrowful. And sometimes he just releases a large amount of air through that small opening, creating a jarring sound.\nBut it's not just his technique which makes him different. His actual voice is also responsible. When David sings long ""A"" sounds like ""cake"" and ""fair,"" it sounds like two jackals shredding a frozen turkey. Words that have a short ""o"" sound, however, sound more like a flatulent rhino furiously being denied service.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";A true testament to the redeeming power of song.

Too bad it's from another band. But make no mistake, the album ""Looking For the Best of David Hawhawhaw <GIMLET>"" is a masterpiece unto itself. And David is a wonder to behear.\nAnd what went into the preparation for this album is amazing. David made sure to find the finest rock musicians this side of a small town comedy club. He hired the world famous BMG International record company, the label that brought you Vasco Rossi, Juliette Schoppman and Shawn Desman. He even went to the local Sears department store to get his photo taken for the cover.\nAll that preparation paid off. The songs are intermixed with tragedy, beauty, dramedy, and the rank of a taint. David's lyrics fly off the speakers like flying things of a surface. And David's voice. His voice. That voice that resembles a polar bear getting an HJ from a lobster.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";An eternal classic for generations to cum.
161;265.0;5.0;8.0;"Beyond the raving fanbase of David Hadtoomuchtoodrinkandwentforadrive, there is ""respeck"" from other musical circles. Hip hop artists tip their hat to Knight Rider whenever they talk about their pimped out rides. Country artists always reference love lost on a beach, drowning their sorrows in the tide of the bay's waters. And heavy metal rockers love to use David's oversized head as the model for skulls on their album covers. (Ask any  forensic pathologist to recreate the head from those skulls, and you will find his likeness staring up at you.)\nAnd why not? Why not respect an artist whose contributions to music, television, and police blotters is comparable only to those of Whitney Houston? David HasnocareerbeyondHollywoodSquares is a treasured artiste, a man with a vision and a hunk with a heart. If he passed gas and recorded it onto CD, we would not be able to tell the difference between that and this album. Yes, it's that good. And probably all this respect stems from David's unforgettable voice, a voice that some critics have likened to an angry malamute raping a basket of fritters.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";DWI= Driving While Intoxicatingly GORGEOUS!
164;266.0;5.0;8.0;"Top marks go to David H and the folks at BMG International. They have crafted a stellar album that will remain on CD shelves FOREVER.\nAlthough the songs tackle pretty quotidien subjects as cleaning the hamster cage and rubbing one's self off into a sock, the structure and symmetry of their melodies stand out as beautiful, musical origami. ""Flying On the Wings of Tenderness"" is a perfect example of such melodic structure. The C chord followed by another C chord speaks volumes of the musicians' ability to repeat a chord. In contrast, however, David never sings the same note twice, even if he attempts to. Instead, he throws his vocal chords AROUND each note, strangling all the juice out of them until they burst in your mouth. And sometimes, he takes two notes at once, balancing them on his tongue and lolling them up and down like two marbles in a sack.\nBut delivery aside, you have to marvel at David's success as a pop star. He has taken a failing career as an actor and parlayed that into a failing career as a musician. That takes guts and hair.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Holy Shelalegh, this one's a WINNER!

And so it is for the immortal David Halfnhalf.  Though German by descent, his braying tenor sends all mankind into writhing aural ecstasy.\nIn ""Looking For- Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]"", I can only compare his voice to that of a sick weasel being dredged in flour by an angry two-year-old.  Add to this his possibly synthetic mane of curly locks, his aging-yet-still-not-bad body, and his past association with a talking car and you end up with rock and roll's indisputable king, or should I say fuhrer.\nDarvin Hackysack, this time you've outdone yourself, and might I add that your paean ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Haffenpheifer Strikes Again!
176;268.0;5.0;8.0;"This album's crowning glory is undoubtedly the song 'Hot Shot City'.  One interesting aspect of this piece derives from its original notation as an intabulation. The accidentals are explicitly notated rather than being left to the performer's discretion. It can be seen that, despite the apparent basis for the piece in transposed Dorian mode, the composer had in mind a fairly clear notion of G minor. In this same collection, however, one can find passages where the concept of major-minor tonality was not so clearly held. One could argue, of course, that the ""altered notes"" that turn this passage toward major-minor tonality do not contravene any rules of Renaissance counterpoint; however, it is particularly good nonetheless.";Sublime genius... the very pinnacle of musical expression

So tell your mama to stop smoking that crackpipe and listen to these gorgeous tunes by David Hopperfleef.\nWhat you and your mama will find is that each song is a golden link in a brilliant, shining chain of song achievement, a chain that is worn by an oiled up, bronzed faux-bodyguard. That gold chain hangs from David's trapezoid of a neck, shining forth like a beacon in the fog of pop music. And every once in a while, VOOM, the lighthouse shines forth with a new hit:\nVOOM- ""Dance Dance D'amour.""\nVOOM- ""Freedom For the World.""\nVOOM- ""Flying On the Wings of Tenderness.""\nVOOM- ""Je T'aime Means I...""\nVOOM- ""Wait, I didn't finish the last...""\nVOOM.\nVOOM.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";The culmination of all that is great
183;270.0;5.0;8.0;"As Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey struggle to update their sounds without losing their core following, David Slankerponk keeps on delivering power ballads and inspirational pop without ever losing his vocal footing. What sets ""Looking For-Best of David Halvercreek [IMPORT]"" apart from his previous chart-toppers is an unrelenting theme of joy and believing in one's self. From the inspirational tempo of ""Do the Limbo Dance"" (David's equivalent to Cher's ""Believe"") to the ""stop-harrassing-my-sheep"" message in ""Freedom For the World,"" the album bristles with an upbeat mood that--even for non-fans--can be hard to resist (it's important to note that almost every track speaks of heartbreak here). Small concessions to staying in step with pop trends appear on the dance-floor tracks (which bring to mind Shania Twain and even Britney Spears), but ballads like ""Throw My Meat Against A Gong"" and ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" stick to the tried-and-true formula of allowing Hassbehoff's impressive voice to take center stage, a voice that many can compare to a chihuahua accidentally sitting on a greased pickle. Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT] is both well timed and well executed. It contains many surprises, and ""Hot Shot City"" seriously is particularly good.";Can a man be considered a diva? YES.
184;271.0;5.0;8.0;"There's so much about the human brain that we haven't learned yet. How does it retain so much information? What are the uncharted regions of the brain, and what kind of function do they serve? Why does the mind react so violently to the music sung by David Huskiefeet?\nThe answer must lie in the ability of the brain to identify pleasure from pain. For example, during ""Freedom For the World,"" EEG brain patterns register a definite spike in pain- a spike comparable to getting one's pubic hair yanked out. Patterns created from ""Je T'aime Means I Love You"" are similar to getting suckerpunched in the throat by a gorilla. And probably most interestingly, ""These Lovein' Eyes"" creates dramatic changes from pain (stubbing a toe) to extreme pain (applying a cheese grater to one's feet, then walking on hot coals), mostly from its misspelled title.\nThe source of all this, of course, is David Plattertosh's voice, a voice that some researchers have suggested sounds like two badgers scratching the paint off a steel wastebasket. And the song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";A truly gifted master

The silence between each track on the CD is unbearable, because you are aching to be immersed in the perfection of his voice every moment. And once his singing shines through again, you are drenched in the magnificence of Hasselchoff's unique voice, a voice that recalls the sounds a furious rhino makes as it falls down a long flight of steps.\nHas anyone heard the song ""Hot Shot City?""

""Crazy For You"" is a classic. So is the other one. And that one about the world. Then there's that one with the French words. Then that other one in German or something.

201;274.0;5.0;8.0;"Almost two decades after releasing his first album, ""Highway to My Heyhey,"" David Hankerpants has remained a fixture in the firmament of pop stars. His long, illustrious career has covered everything from standard blues rock on the 1975 album ""Tongue In My Peephole"" to experimental Far Eastern influences on ""Curry On My Wayward Son."" The sheer breadth, depth and girth of his catalog of work has yet to be exceeded by anyone from Baywatch. (Pamela Anderson released a double album in 1988 named ""Tweak These,"" but only sold about 40 copies.)\nBut volume aside, the quality of his hits are exquisite. Sinatra would kill to have the series of songs that David has hit out of the ballpark, Frank. ""Flying On the Wings of Tenderness,"" or affectionately known as FOWT, is a treasure, a standard that crooners at every karaoke bar jockey to sing next. And the other songs are good, too.

From the opening bars of his first masterpiece, Looking for Freedom, I felt my heart swell with joy and divine peace.  Crazy for You was a lovely upbeat little break and I found myself humming it in the shower and even once or twice during my Friday night prayer meeting.  Do the Limbo Dance was absolutely wonderful.

He ensures that his repertoire matches the quality of his magnificent voice, a voice that sounds like...oops, I did that already. The songs he sings are carefully handpicked to show not only a range in emotion but a depth of feeling in the lyrics. ""Crazy For You"" has lyrics so heartbreaking that most people skip over that track. ""Flying On the Wings of Tenderness,"" with its jaunty beat and spoken word intro, is a song that only David Halventrack can sing. When non-German speaking listeners hear the foreign words on ""Wir Zwei Allein,"" they nod in recognition and start discussing their phlegm problems.

351;301.0;5.0;8.0;"Within his famed intellectual discourse ""Wissenschaft der Logik""(Science of Logic), the German Historian-Philospher Hegel effectively advocates the utilization of a thesis/antithesis schema, by which, to view significant events in the natural world and, thus, history.  These diametrically opposed and perpetually competing historical forces manifest themselves throughout the record of man's endeavours. Indeed, these very tenets advanced by Hegel may be contemporarily applied to that of the modern music scene, particularly with regard to this alblum.\nWithin recent years, a mass popular music trend emphasizing the use of aurally pleasing, harmonized vocals has come to form the ""antithesis"" of the perceptually ""proper"" musical archetype.  Fortunately for us, It is such that the ""thesis"", the forces of positive change, may be wholly unified by this singular work of unparalelled talent.  The constant lyrical similarity and tonal dissonance work to right all that is wrong with the music of today.

Those seeking solace in the embrace of gentle tones find comfort in ""Looking For Freedom,"" whereas those who want to reach rock's highest peaks can enjoy the majesty of ""Wir Zwei Allein."" And those who are fans of the sounds of a team of oxen being beaten by a kayak oar can enjoy Hasselhoff's incomparable voice. When fans of this music go to a local record store and cannot find it, it always is a comfort knowing that one can probably be found at the cutout bin or the freebie section, near the zines and free newspapers. And finally, those who abhor music in general can find some argument for their case after hearing every one of these compositions.

One wonders how many sleepless hours he spent poring over so much great material. How could he choose between so many great hits? What heartbreaking decision was it to pick ""Crazy For You"" over ""Howling While Banging a Frying Pan?""  Was it the limit of CD space that forced him to omit ""Cupping My Hand Under My Arm (and Making Rude Noises?)"" The mind boggles.

427;311.0;5.0;8.0;"It is tempting, when writing this review, to rate it on David's looks alone. His hair is soft and fragrant, like mice dipped in Chanel no. 5. His skin is the most delightful chamois one could hope to touch. Looking into his eyes is like looking into deep, unfathomable pools of ocular jelly, and his teeth are whiter than his audience.\nBut no! To talk any longer on the dreaminess of David is folly. For here on this CD is a collection of music so divine that it brings tears to my eyes and a lump to my trousers. David's singing skills are so expansive and so experimental that he eschews mere ""notes"" and ""keys"" and instead rockets into whole new realms of sound. One minute he sings with the manly grumble of an ox crushed by a pneumatic piston - the next he has the graceful strength of someone sledgehammering blowfish. Soaring vocals go higher than any mountain climber could, even if he had wings and was in a space shuttle. Then just as quickly they swoop down like a suicidal Japanese businessman, hitting the sidewalk with a biological thump. Beats swirl around like kittens in a washing machine as a series of dancing mosquitos tinkle like triangles stapled to a doormouse. Crumbling walls become dirt-trodden werewolves and the flitting, spritely air of a gibbon can be heard in the distance. And then track 2 begins!\nJust look at his experimental titles too - ""Du"" (you), ""Je T'Aime Means I Love You"" (I love you means I love you), ""Wir Zwei Allein"" (I am two Alans) and ""Danice Dance d'Amour"" (Dennis and his Dancing Armour).

456;315.0;5.0;8.0;"I, as a music writer, as well as a member of the general music/record buying public, am duly qualified, if not obligated, to review this nugget of musical delight.\nI have perused the previous reviews, which certainly inspired me to purchase this record.  How true they were.  Of course, there is the obvious, it has a great beat, and you can dance to it, but what about the subtle beauty, the vein of ""truth"" running through. I did skip directly to track 6, a priceless gem, however, there was a mistake in doing so [skipping forward], and I am surprised that no one has previously mentioned it.\nLooking For - David Hasselhoff is a CONCEPT album, to end all concept albums as well as a rock opera.  Forget Sgt. Pepper, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, Tommy, A Quick One, or even Radiohead's OK Computer.  This record must be listened to in sequential order to get the full impact and message it is sending us.  We MUST RESIST THE URGE TO SKIP TO TRACK 6, AND REPEAT IT OVER & OVER AGAIN.\nDavid starts by taking us along on his quest for freedom, the opening ""score"" shows us his vision of the world, once his utopian society, or Nirvana has been obtained.  Call him not a fool, his dream is real, although seemingly unobtainable.  The second introduces us to his Swahili opressors, while his love interest is brought into our vision in tracks three and four (a love so strong, we must Limbo).  Tracks five and six take us up into the air, as he is the ""Top Gun"" waging his war on the oppressors.  He is a fighter pilot for freedom, coming down into his ambiguous love's arms at the end of his treacherous flight, the hotshot daredevil!  He has ""ridden into the danger zone""!\nHe ""saves the world"", confesses his love for his flight instructor, wonders if this ""freedom"" is all it's cracked up to be, curses the French and their refusal to commit to either side, and so much more.  I would rather not give away the surprise ending, and would hope that all of you will give it a re-listen to see for yourselves.\nIn conclusion, this record is more than a masterpiece.  There are too many levels in which to absorb it, each with it's own facets, requiring hundreds of reviews.  I could spend the rest of my life reviewing this magnum opus, and still not have coverd every angle.  This is Mr. Hasselhoff's Iliad and Odyssey, all rolled into one.\nOh, also, adding to the magic, although recorded years earlier, track 6 played backwards speaks the words ""Hepatitis is with Pam Anderson Lee.

The kind of feeling I imagine I would get if I were to donate a vast amount of someone elses money to a charity I'd never heard of, or if you've got a minute, the feeling I would get if I spent vast amounts of somebody elses money on [...] and Thai brides.\n\nWhy people are all talking about the rise to fame of singer song writers like Damien Rice when they should be worshipping at the alter of Dudley Hofflehas is so far beyond me that I've forgotten what I was talking about.  What separates the men from boys is something called star quality and a pair of really tight leather trousers with a sock stuffed down the front for girth deception. You're either born with it or you're not. Duane Hesaltine was definitely born with something and before you say syphilis I'm talking about pure sex appeal. Dingle Humperdink clearly has this.  How else would a man that looks like a microphone stand be able to land lead roles in classics television programs like Knightrider.\n\nNow to the music. I have to mention Je T'Aime (means I love you), educational as well as beautifully moving. Genius.  When I listen to this song I feel what can only be described as arousement culminating in the eternal bachelor's pastime of a pot noodle, followed by [...].\n\nI heard a small child bad mouthing the great one the other day, so I beat him with a stick until he stopped breathing and yes I felt like a big man when I hit that little kid.\n\nDon Juan de Hoffingdong I salute you.

144;328.0;5.0;7.0;This CD has been the soundtrack to my life for some years now - imagine my surprise when I realised that one of the world's great icons of popular culture felt the same way! The National Film Theatre here in London recently ran a retrospective of the great Jean Luc Godard. Being an avid fan, I attended a showing of his magnificent and rarely seen 1999 epic La Boeuf et le Voiture. Godard has always been famed for his instinctive use of music. After a particularly moving scene framed with the delicate tones of a Hindemith string quartet, the scene changed to a view of rolling French countryside, a lone ramshackle cottage, a rusted piece of farm machinery juxtaposing with this scene of rural bliss. Seamlessly, the soundtrack switched - genius! The song 'Hot Shot City' arrived with its vivid lyrical imagery, its subtle harmonic textures, its moving evocation of an era that seems almost a distant, fleeting memory. The scene was completed, the music crashing over me like a terrible, wonderful wave of emotion, perfectly complementing Godard's perfect visual imagery. Oh, how I wept!;A terrifying and wonderful wave of emotion
160;329.0;5.0;7.0;"Good Heavenly Gracious, I am so thankful Hasselhoff comes on CD. He used to come on cassette tape and he also came on vinyl, but when I recently bought my CD player, I was nervous that he never came on CDs. But boy was I wrong! A recent trip to Tower Records revealed that not only did he come on tape and vinyl, he most recently came all over CD format as well! Imagine my joy when I came home and popped the CD in my player, listening to all the coming Hasselhoff did on that wondrous disk! Boy, he just came and came with all that great music.\nHasselhoff is one of those rare talents that combines the drama of Baywatch, the suspense of Knight Rider, the rugged musk of Star Search, and the Teutonic magnificence of the Germans. Combine that with a voice like two pumas rogering an armadillo, and you've got one heck of a best-selling CD!\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";This One Goes To 11.... O' Clock!

That fact that so many people have been exposed to his unique talent definitely makes me feel as part of a worldwide community.\nWhat so many have learned over the years is how emotional and beautiful his songs really are. Crafted to perfection by the same songwriters who did ""Footloose"" on Broadway and both Rembrandts albums, these songs will stand the test of time. Look for them soon in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! Yeah!\nBut probably what has attracted so many fans over the last 7 years is David Hoppervenk's voice, a voice that resembles two hysterical mongoose shredding a corn on the cob.

I am personal friends with several sound technicians, and they agree that most of David's earsplitting caterwauling is not modified in any way.\nIt is their personal opinion that such agonizing shrieking may be altered by pitch or frequency, but why would anyone bother? His tremulous screaming is so distinctive that no studio in their right mind would want to lay a finger on it. That high-pitched wail is his trademark. Everyone knows that David Huskertongs sings just like two hyenas mauling a sack of polystyrene peanuts.\nBut whatever your opinion about how it got made, you must agree that you thank the Lord that it was made.

I'd imagine it would feel like doing whippets  on a roller coaster while receiving pleasure from Connie Chung.\n""Freedom For the World"" would probably assault one's ears next, breaking through the tympanic membrane and filling the inner ear with hot, danceable fluid.\nThen would come the unforgettable aural reaming that is ""Everybody Sunshine,"" an insistent march from the ear to the heart, featuring David Hunkenblatt's voice- a voice that many have compared to a walrus getting a root canal.\nAnd finally, one would be deaf enough just to hear the lilting strains of ""Hot Shot City,"" a beautiful song that the eardrums would feel is particularly good.";Darn Good.

If word got out that this beautiful music even existed, there would be riots at every music store in the world.\nSuch a decision has proven to be wise, for the 2 dozen people who actually do own this glittering disc of perfection must now live behind a barricade, naked in a corner and armed with a shotgun.

I have to admit I was thinking it might be a bit of a joke after all the stick David Hasseltoft has received recently but this really is a superbly written, intelligent set of songs.

Now that has changed, with the release of 'Wyt ti'n gwybod ble mae Dafydd Haffelogogoch [MAG] ~ Dafydd Haffelogogoch', the Welsh-language version of his masterwork. This Welsh translation, though not always literally identical to the English, never fails to maintain the feel and spirit of the original.\nSeasoned listeners will already know that track 6, 'Hwch Lodig City', is particularly good, but all will be surprised by the intensity Haffelogogoch is able to generate not only on this justly-famous paeon to modern living, but throughout the album.\nAround the world, millions have used the romantic expressions of love and lust found on Haffelogogoch's albums to complete the mood on steamy nights in with a loved one, or alone. Now, your chances of wooing that filly from Crymech have improved tenfold, with just one purchase.\nAs a frequent backpacker, I only hope that Hasselhogg will release further versions of this essential album in more languages - I long for the day when my pack is filled with nothing but versions of this CD and I am welcomed everywhere I go.\nFive stars, and highly recommended.;Wooing fillies from Crymech?

From the pants-wetting thrills of ""Looking for Freedom"" to the epic bowel-emptying climax of  ""I Believe"", David Hossenfeffer lends his artistry to the most excruciatingly original delivery of rock and roll since Brittany Spears first chose music over a life of prostitution.  The music gods are literally going to war over this set.  You can imagine the powers that be ready to commit Hari-Kari over this mind altering collection.  I find myself crippled with abdominal distress, as the CD seems to carry on endlessly.  The delirious agony peaks on the seventh song: ""Save The World"".  I literally had to phone 911 after the first dozen bars of this hidden treasure in Dufus Hagelberg's catalog.  The EMS technicians threatened a mercy killing if I continued to refuse to mute the stereo system.  Once the eighth song "" Those Lovin' Eyes"" began, they ran from my dwelling seeking treatment from the technician who wisely stayed behind in their vehicle.  I was glad to see them leave, as I realized at this moment, that surviving this torrent of aural torture would surely make me a stronger and better person in the long run.

For the music that adorns and infests the singular CD I own is that of the one and only Darvid Hastlehof.\n\nHastlehof is a genius, the likes of which this world will never again be acquainted with. How a man can create art as deep, intelligent, thought-provoking, creative, spiritual, melodious, ground-breaking and downright essential as this, whilst at the same time remain so grounded, humble, genial and hairy is a question I fear will never be answered. In writing and performing the songs on this album, Hastlehof clearly plumbed the depths of the human experience to a level never before charted. He was brave enough to wrestle with the previously untouched black-holes of his own psyche, and yet somehow he managed to return from the event horizon with his sanity and leather jacket intact.\n\nListening to this CD is like being dead: it's never gonna get any better. Because this CD is unbetterable. It's the best.\n\nThat's why it's the only CD I own. And that's why it should be the only CD you own. When you have perfection, why settle for inferiority too?\n\nOh.

Therefore, as a longtime fan of really bad music, I had to buy this CD.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The music isn't really all that bad; sure, the songs are formulaic and the lyrics are unbelievably trite, but I was hoping for something with the sheer awfulness of early Shatner/Nimoy, Bobby Goldsboro, The Shaggs, The Annoying Music Show... you know, the greats.  Only three of the tunes on this album significantly pegged my bad-o-meter: ""Save the World"" (which is only bad because of the awful extra vocals by David Hasselhoff's young daughter), ""Freedom for the World"", and ""Je T'Aime Means I Love You"" (which may have seemed worse than it is given that I'd already heard the 13 previous bad songs in a row). In fact, much as I hate to say it, track 6, ""Hot Shot City"", is, as widely reported, pretty good (at least as bad songs go).  This is not really a Bad Music album; it's more like a slightly rockier version of a Michael Bolton CD.

You may find that hard to believe but just sit down for a couple of days and really think about the words. I mean you soon realise that the man is right, everybody IS sunshine - in their own way.\nBeleive me, music doesn't get deeper then this, and studio performances don't get any more exciting. The power with which he chokes out a chorus will cause your pulse to pound and your bowels to loosen. And for him to put possibly the greatest photograph since the invention of the camera lense (and vaseline) was the icing on the cake.;To be touched by hangleharf

The only downfall of this one cd is it is just that one cd. A best of David Hasselhoff in one cd is like saying a cup of water holds the power and majesty of the ocean. Hasselhoff is an artist with his voice his pallet and the world is his canvas. He paints pictures of love won and love lost, happiness and sadness. When the cd was over I sat still and starred at my wall. I knew then my life had changed I knew what life meant. ""Some people stand in the darkness afraid to step into the light...I'll be ready.""

It's pure pop sensibilities inspires me to get on an old beat up ten-speed bike and ride across town hollering at anyone that will listen to me about the genius that is David Hasselhoff and then maybe I'd cut off my pinky toes and mail them to a complete stranger.;Hasselhoff........mad genius?
367;357.0;5.0;7.0;"If you have ever felt the warmth of a mothers love, if you have ever seen the inoocence in a child's eye, if you have ever wondered on the cuteness of a little bunnies floppy ears... find all these feelings and more expressed one more time by a modern day musical genius.. a veritable paragon of this semi-classical musical form..\nOn the other hand if you have ever felt the terror of an oncomming war, or the evil of a dictators lawlessness, the horror of death and the nighmareish soul busting angst of the human condition. Here you will find each of these reprised and set in a wonderful tableau of 'living music'.\nWe are surely not worthy of such an incredible CD. I for one feel honoured and humbled that this should be released.. what is probably 1000 years before its time... now.. and can only repay his unending kindness by buying all available copies now and distributing them to orphans and homeless people.\nThank you David.. Thankyou from the world..\n(""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good btw )";A piece of paradise in plastic CD form
378;358.0;5.0;7.0;Yesterday I saw the birth of new life. Yes, that's right, new life breathed into the world of popular music. Oh how we have awaited the arrival of this breath of fresh air in a world of mediocrity. David Hooverdaft's album is the sparkling light in a chasm of darkness and despair. His vocal tones can be likened to the sound of a rutting rhinoceros who has broken into the female pen. Thank you oh thank you for this great work. I particularly enjoyed Hot Shot City with it's courageous and flawless rhythms. Shine on you crazy Diamond!;Splendiferous !
386;359.0;5.0;7.0;"How soon people forget. Back in 1995 everyone was playing this album, roller skating at the local disco with their hippie beads, protesting Vietnam and whatnot. But now, they're all grown up preppies, listening to Dexy's Midnight Express or J-Lo albums. What none of them realize is that David Hasselhoff is a perennial favorite, a timeless gem of a singer with a voice a lot like three wild boars attacking a wounded elk. So instead of being ""hip"" or ""with it"" or ""having taste,"" I choose Hasselhoff for his amazing songs. The song Hot Shot City is still particularly good, after all these years.";Still the best out there, he is!
400;360.0;5.0;7.0;It's pretty astounding when you realize how many hits David Hasselhoff has put up there on the charts, even after the release of this Greatest Hits album. This writer estimates that about 44 incredible songs have hit the airwaves since Hasselhoff decided to give up a serious acting career and try his hand at crooning. And that's not even including the jingles for hair gel, ointment cream, toothpaste, eardrops, and toenail fungus commercials. So it's safe to say that Mr. Hasselhoff has made a major, major contribution to the music industry with his massive collection of tunes and his great voice, a voice that sort of resembles eight geese stuck under a flat tire. The song Hot Shot City is particularly good.;It contours to fit your back, reducing pressure points!
406;361.0;5.0;7.0;"Someone hold me down, because I'm about to go Big Willy Style with this humpariffic set o' monsta hits! David H is unstoppable with his hair weave and cleft chins, thrusting songs out of his abdomen as if he wuz squeezing out oversized corn dogs. Songs like ""Crazy For You"" and ""Do the Limbo Dance"" scream out class and demand attention at the local legal discotheque. David H's voice shines like a silver ball, finding its way inside your cheek and forcing a path past your tongue and down your throat. A lesser singer would keep only 8 hits on their comp CD, but David goes all the way with 17 marvelous tracks. And that's including the song ""Hot Shot City,"" which is particularly good.";The most danceable German marches yet!
409;362.0;5.0;7.0;"Rather than spout compliment after compliment upon David Hasselhoff and his muscular, tanned body of work, I want to share briefly my experience with the song ""Is Everybody Happy."" Few people know this, but that very song was penned by my good friend Joey Bishop back in 1967. He and I were having Rob Roys at the Sands casino in Vegas, and he had just finished performing in the Bongo Room. A quite green bartender was awfully star-struck, and was asking for his autograph. Plus, two young fillies had followed Bishop from the lounge and were trying to get his attention. I was attempting to ask Joey for the [money] he had borrowed from me, and a valet had come in to tell Joey that his car was blocking another limo. It was at that exasperated moment that Joey screamed ""IS EVERYBODY HAPPY?"" and that's when the song was born. I also have a particularly good story about ""Hot Shot City,"" penned by my good friend Burt Bacharach, but that's for another day.";Really quite exceptional. Highly recommended!
411;363.0;5.0;7.0;Not enough praise has been bestowed upon our dear, dear David Hoffenshaf, for he is a constant source of aural pleasure with his storytelling songs of hope and song. It's probably a moot point to tell everyone that you can't get this CD at your local Coconuts or Sam Goody, but that's my point- David Hasselhoff is actually TOO GOOD for those cheap chain stores. Anyone can waltz into their local...store and grab a Beatles or Led Zeppelin album. You can't swing a dead cat...without hitting a Madonna or Jets album. And Dire Straits CDs are so common, you are likely to slip on one walking through a dollar store. The finest things in life are rare, and so is David Hasselhoff's magnificent voice, a voice that resembles two monkeys in a wet towel deathmatch. And THAT is why you can purchase this beloved import only from this site. The song Hot Shot City is particularly good.;Better than a Bento Box at Takahashi!
413;364.0;5.0;7.0;"It's time to grab a stick of butter and a pillow to bite on, because this CD is off tha HOOK. Clocking in at a mere 2 hours 45 minutes, this album is sure to rock out either your drum n' bass show or bridge party. Each song is textured differently with assorted marimba or tango beats, but it is David Hasselhoff's amazing voice which is the constant here. His melodic baritone sounds remarkably like a cross between a badger being drop kicked and a deaf mute yelling in traffic. But it's probably his good looks and charisma that have captured the imagination of so many teenage girls. I attended a show of his at a local Denny's, and I have to say it is almost as good as one of those laser shows at the planetarium. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";To the extreme, he rocks the mic like a vandal.
416;365.0;4.0;7.0;After devoting a major portion of my life to the epic masterpiece that was Baywatch, I felt that life was never going to offer anymore substance to my otherwise dreary existence.  Well how wrong I was?!?!?!\nDavid's album is a god send. I know people always go on about the Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra and S Club 7 as the definers of modern music but let me say with confidence that The Hassmeister should be leading that list.\nI was going to point out the specific songs that moved me spiritually and digestively, but then I realised that all it takes is to listen from start to finish just once, you'll find the whole CD a masterpiece in the Rick Astley sense.\nSexy, sensual and suppository.;All hail Mitch!
40;366.0;5.0;5.0;"Perhaps mine is a bit of an unusual review for this product.\n\nI did not buy this for the music. I bought it for the cover. Specifically, the beautiful scenery behind Daggit Hustleoff. It depicts a beautiful scene of serenity and peace that is rarely seen in our modern landscape. Too often we spend our days looking at bland subway walls, colorless cubicle farms, and artificially colored images fed to us on sixty-inch screens by the evil media corporations. We forget that there is a beautiful world beyond our walls. A world rich in nature, in simplicity, in harmony. We fail to reach out to this world because we forget that it is there. But Daggit reminds us of it. He beckons us to stop living the artificial lives that we create and return to this harmonious relationship with the world we live in. He shows himself happy and relaxing in this pristine world. I wish I could join you, Daggit, and melt into that happy universe with you as one.\n\nI did listen to the song ""Hot Shot City"", which is particularly good.";Ignore the music, appreciate the cover!
421;367.0;5.0;7.0;"This music is something to cherish, to soak your hair and feet in, and something worth staying home and listening to until you're scabby and sitting in your own filth, throwing rocks at kids who peek in your windows to ""check out the old weird guy with rashy arms."" Davis Hatherponk is an exceptional vocalist, at master at guttural yells. His capped teeth act as a speculum for his gaping hole of a throat, from which flow the singularly most beautiful songs. He sings almost in keeping with the music, and our reward for listening to his wails and moans is the satisfaction that we haven't gone deaf yet. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Linkin Park doesn't even come close!!!
436;368.0;5.0;7.0;"I actually enjoy this CD! Listen to ""Freedom For the World."" for instance. If there ever was a time to listen to this inspirational song, in these dreadful days of political problems, that moment would be now. Same thing goes for ""Save the World"" and ""Looking For Freedom."" All of these songs are inspirational to me! And the other more fun songs are a real hoot, too. You could imagine songs like ""Do the Limo Dance"" or ""Is Everybody Happy"" on X-103, our radio station.  The song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";A great album, no joke!
457;369.0;4.0;7.0;Now, don't get me wrong here: This is clearly the best album ever recorded since the conception of the necessary equipment, and truly deserves 5 stars. However, I had to cut it down to four because upon listening to it for the first time, my brother shrieked with joy then collapsed into a lifeless pile on the floor. At first I was taken back by this, but then that sweet, sweet Hasselhoff sound entered back into my brain and I was put to ease. The autopsy revealed that my brother died of bliss, so that is why I am only giving the CD 4 stars.;WARNING: May be dangerous to mortal ears.
460;370.0;5.0;7.0;"When Hasselhof released 'Hooked on a Feeling' in the Spring of 1999, the world gasped as one. Musically speaking Everest had been climbed, the Titanic had been raised, AIDS had been cured.\nBut then came 'Looking For...'.\nNobody had expected it. Nobody had dreamt of it. Nobody had even wanted it! But David Hasselhoff has done it. He's gone one almighty step further. With 'Do the Limbo Dance' he's jumped off the snowy peaks of Everest into the waiting arms of angels; with 'Hot Shot City' he's stuck an outboard onto the Titanic and by God he's gonna sail that damn ship into harbour; with Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff, David Hasselhoff has concocted a  medicine for death itself.\nImmortal.

467;372.0;5.0;7.0;"My 'Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]' CD now resembles an old vinyl record as the laser has burnt grooves into this shiny reflective mastepiece.  'The Hassie' isn't aftraid of tackling tough subjects as in the very first track he confronts a wealthy man's conscience.  It's a swashbuckling, fight to the death showstopper of a song, the type of which can only be recreated in the movies.  The words speak for themselves  ""Worked on a faaaarm got some muscle in my aaaaarm but still I'm not a self maade maaaaan"".  By the end he's still looking for that defining moment of Freedom where ""It caaannt be foooooound"".  I felt so humble.  A tip for any wannabe `Pop Idols' - perform in front of the panel and you'll be in the next round after the first verse.\nIn `Crazy For you' Davey boy expresses his love for his partner in a way that, in my opinion, no other love song has ever touched.  It starts slow but builds up into a pounding bontempi organ beat that leaves you breathless and your heart racing, a skill mastered by only the greatest composers.  But David has an advantage here, namely lyrics ""Im craaayzzee for yooou, you're craaayzzzeee for me, you and I belong together, like the saaand and sea"".  Pause.  Think.  Love......\nThe H cleverly breaks down all barriers of racial stereotypes with a perfect tribute to the culture and people of the Jamaica today.  He rightly states that, next to the steel band that plays on every beach, you can ""Limbo ooooooh, limbo ayeeeee, everybody gets a chance.  Clap your haaands its parteeee time, doooooo dee limboooo daaance.""  Close your eyes, smell the ganja and coconuts.  If he'd done this at Gastonbury we'd be looking at this weeks new UK No1.\n\nOn track 5 my heart fizzed like an alka seltza that had just been dropped in a cool glass of water.  ""There are a billion people on this plaaaanet and now I've found the one for meeeeee"", ""We'll build a castle of hoooonesty, fill the room with the haaaaarmony"".  It's taken days for me to comprehend. If the US could strap speakers to their jet fighters and blast this over the war zones it'll be over with a big hug and a few ""Sorry's""\nThe best, in my opinion, can be found on track 6 where ""Hot Shot City on a Saturday niiiight,  were gonna paaarty on down the morning liiiiight"".  Magical. Cunningly in this track he employs the use of an instrument (sounds like a guitar), unlike his usual formula of drum machine/repeat the chorus until the end. It's a gamble that paid off. ""Were hot like rock and rooooooll"" - I can't stop singing it to myself.\nI could go on but the best advice would be to just go and buy.\nI'm not letting on what is next for me in life but I know it can't fail because ""Tonight Matthew I'm going to be......""";Building castles of honesty....
474;373.0;5.0;7.0;"It is difficult for a man of few words, such as myself, to express the joy and wonderment I felt during one long spring morning spent listening to Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT].  Wonderful tracks and inspired musical phrasing is a rare commodity in todays musical environment, but Hasselhoff delivers both, and so much more, within the folds of this awesome album.\nThe true genius and objective of music has always been to engender an emotional response in the listener.  I cried during David's 'Looking for Freedom' as I remembered the falling of the Berlin Wall; thinking of the Berliners recalling this song as the soundtrack to the moment they cast off the chains of the East.  I wept during 'Je T'Aime Means I Love You' recalling my own days spent waiting for the girl who never comes.  I damn near fell to my knees and died in front of the speakers when I heard ""hot shot city"" which I found particulaly good.\nDavid's use of tonal range and harmonic mixolidian scale call and response techniques show a studied musicians skill.  Clearly he stands tall in his field.  How many others can boast a talking car, a tight pair of beach shorts,a voice quite unlike any other singer and a huge German fan base.  The term 'Jack of all trades, master of none' has clearly never been understood by Hasselhof, and who are we to tell him.....\nBuy it now, you'll thank me..... you know you will";Words cannot express the musical genius contained within

138;378.0;5.0;6.0;David was not always easy to admire in his role as Mitch the Lifeguard in Baywatch. He treated women badly and didn't always respect the animals in quite the right way.\n\nNow, like Backstreet, he's BACK! David combines the good looks and moral outlook of George Michael with the singing skills and dancing talent of Milli Vanilli. He's UNIQUE!!!!\n\nThis CD is for women and for men because of the variety of differing songs and musical styles. Men will appreciate the raw sex appeal of the Hoff and women will appreciate the touchingly sentimental lyrics (I neeeeed you tonight, we shouldn't fight, you are like a light, let's fly like a kite etc etc)\n\nIn many ways, this CD is a microcosm of society in the 21st century.\n\nI would sum up this CD with the following words:\n\nINSPIRATION, GESTICULATION, LIBERATION, EXCLAMATION;The story of our lives........
44;379.0;5.0;5.0;What is the 20th Century all about? How about the 21st Century? It's about Mr. David Hasselhoff. He is the defining voice, the defining face of the here, and the of the now. What more can I say? I LOVE you Dave!;Not just an album, but rather a statement of our time
152;380.0;5.0;6.0;"Should one attempt to summarize this album in one word, the word would have to be unbelieveable.\nDavid Hasselhoff's musical skills and his angel-like voice exceed far beyond the often quoted (and mostly misunderstood) ""German beat"". In fact, the beat of Mr. Hasselhoff's music might much better be described as ""World beat"" (although one might argue, the beat is so great it might be considered UNworldly).\nIn dark times such as these an album like Looking for the Best is what the American people need. Listening to alltime favourites such as Wir zwei Allein, Looking for Freedom or Hot Shot City (incidentally the best song on the whole album, possibly the best pop-song ever created) one can forget the troubles of the world for the duration of the album.\nIn deep gratitude I bow to Mr. Hasselhoff's undeniable talent and (much more importantly) to his unprecedented hard work in putting together this masterpiece.\nMr. Hasselhoff was looking for the best and let me assure you he truly has found the best.\nIt is really of no importance what music you generally prefer, classical, jazz, pop, rock, alternative, hip hop, electro, as Mr. Hasselhoff has discovered the very soul of music, thus elevating himself and his music above all earthly, ridiculous attempts to categorize this musical gift to mankind as a whole.\nI want to thank Mr. Hasselhoff for his magnificent work which has given me pleasure throughout countless hours (and sometimes days) of uninterrupted study of his music.\nAdditionally to the great music the title of the album offers spiritual guidance to all of us as well.\nLooking for the best.\nIsn't that what America is all about?\nIsn't that the essence of the American Dream?\nIsn't that what Americans (or mankind for that matter) all over the world have been and are fighting for?\nI agree with Mr. Hasselhoff. I think that looking for the best is essentially the goal of all of our existence.\nThe pursuit of excellence is what has inspired this album and surely everyone who has listened to it will agree that the pursuit of excellence has been succesful in this case.\nI, for one, am unspeakably glad I bought this CD while it was still available as it has not only given me pleasure but also helped come to terms with my life. Thank you.\nPS: I would like to emphasize that the song Hot Shot City is simply amazing.";Unbelieveable for lack of a better word

It's been a burden on me for many months now, and I'll have to carry it a little while longer (until my mother's estate is settled).\nThen I plan on coming forward with the truth, which will change everything, and especially convince my ungrateful, unloving son and daughter that everything I have said about Hoffelmarr since LAST NOVEMBER is all TRUE. See, they think they know him- they don't know him. He has always, always been terrible to me, since we were kids. He's a devil, a devil. A terrorist. He's been gaslighting me this entire time, and everyone in the family, all the cousins, have shown their true colors by taking his word over mine. It's been crazymaking. My only comfort at this point is that I'll have my revenge soon, and then my goddamn kids will see- they'll see and they'll be sorry for the way they've treated me through this.\nThe track ""Hotshot City"" is particularly good.";I NEVER WANT TO SEE OR HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN.
156;382.0;5.0;6.0;"Do you remember when people would play Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" album while watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" and seeing remarkable coincidences between the two? You can do the same with ""Looking For- The Best of David Harvardvulvas <IMPORT>"" and the 1998 movie ""You've Got Mail.""\nFor example, when bookstore owner Kathleen Kelly, played by Meg Ryan, first logs on her computer, the tune ""Looking For Freedom"" is playing! Like she's LOOKING FOR someone when she logs on! And then when she meets Joe Fox, son of the owner of rival Fox Discount Bookstores, and soon gets annoyed by his arrogant way of managing business matters, David Hamdongskang is singing ""Save the World!"" Get it? Discount Bookstore? SAVING? Wow! Then when the two finally meet at the end and discover that they are email penpals, David pulls out all the stops and throats out the hit ""Du."" Get it? Two of them together and DU, the German word for two! Uncanny, isn't it? And finally when the credits roll and the words ""Key Grip"" comes up, David Hasselhork is singing with Laura Branigan on ""Believe."" And when David sings on this song, he belts it out like a walrus stuck under a fallen elevator. And it is then that I have a firm GRIP on myself, if you catch my meaning! Key GRIP? GRIP on myself? These can't be coincidences!\nIt's almost as if the producers at BMG International were playing this movie in their studio as they compiled Hakkerstompf's greatest hits. But this is the kicker: ""You've Got Mail"" came out in 1998, two years AFTER the CD came out! That just chills me to the marrow, yo.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is playing when Tom Hanks is adjusting the back of his pants.";Get this and get boogied!
157;383.0;5.0;6.0;"Critics who say that David Hastleslough is overrated need to listen to his songs for themselves before making a judgement. They need to understand that whereas most people sing with their vocal cords and innate talent, David sings from the HEART. Like a samurai warrior, David roams the world without a master, fighting justice wherever injustice arises. No wait, that's Michael Knight.\nAnyhoo, David's singing is an lovely, unusual combination of shrieking and moaning. He skillfully gets his voice to exit both his throat and nostrils at the same time, a feat previously accomplished by only Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. This reviewer wouldn't be surprised if somehow he sang through other unseen orifices.\nObviously, the number one hits are here. The chart-blazing ""Du"" is here. So is the perennial wedding reception dance hit ""Freedom For the World."" And ""Crazy For You"" has been on so many feminine hygiene commercials, one has lost count. Completists will be glad to know that more obscure favorites like ""A Donkey Kick (To My Heart)"" and ""Keeping Abreast"" are also included in this comp. All sung with David's trademark baritone: a voice that Roger Ebert has compared to eighteen orangutans impregnating a water bed.\nAnd the song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";A loving drenching of David's musical juice!

Of course, the arresting officer simply wanted to touch greatness, which is why he trumped up the charges and slapped cuffs on David.\nI hope this officer is remanded to the full extent of the law!  How dare he make up these charges!  I will demand a full investigation.\nOne only need to listen to this album to know that it's genius creator is so sublimely talented, that no way has he ever touched a drop of alcohol!  (that stint in Betty Ford was simply to escape the fans).\nEspecially that song, ""Hot Shot City,"" which is particularly good, and NO WAY could a drunken man have created it's subtlety.";DUI arrest a testament to David's skill
167;385.0;5.0;6.0;"Let's pretend for a moment that none of us have ever heard of Baywatch or David Huskenpork. That would mean we never saw anyone save anyone on the beach in slow motion. We never saw anyone talking to a car with a red eye that goes back and forth. And most tragically, none of us have ever heard the melodic strains of ""LOOKING FOR- THE BEAT OF DANGIN HINKERPOOPS <IMPORT>."" That's a pretty frightening alternative universe.\nFortunately for us, we HAVE heard of such entertainment perfection. And David has regaled us with shirtless running scenes, shirtless love scenes, and shirtless concerts in Carnegie Hall with the New York Symphony accompanying.\nFrankly, I cannot ever imagine a world without David's life-affirming voice, a voice I would personally compare to a hysterical caribou stomping a box of elves. I love those shrieking gags that pour from his majestic gullet.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Ya gots ta balieve!

To miss out on ""Je T'aime Means I Love You"" is unthinkable. To voluntarily avoid ""Freedom For the World"" almost feels like throwing your life away. When they tell you to ""seize the day,"" they actually mean ""seize a copy of Looking For-Best of David Haffelhonk [IMPORT].""\nIt's true. Life is but a walking shadow.

David Thatherthoff applies that same type of logic to singing pop songs, except that he makes the LISTENER suffer. This unique twist on an old approach is what has made him such an enduringly popular singer for over 3 years.\nHis pop songs are like jalapeno poppers that you get at restaurants where all the waiters wear suspenders with buttons on them. They are easily digestible, flavorful, and have terrible clich lyrics about 'rockin on a Saturday night.' David is a master chef as he serves these pop songs. He even chews them for you before dropping them in clumps into your mouth. Sometimes you get one of his tooth caps. Yay.\nThat track ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";This one deserves five stars

How do you go on, when in your heart you know there's no going back. There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep.\nOne of those hurts is listening to this album, ""LOOKING FOR- THE BEST OF DAVID HERUGRIM (IMPORT)."" The sweet pain that assaults the eardrums is like Shelob biting into one's skull. David HornoftheMark sings with a clarion voice that resembles the bellow of a Oliphant as its privates are squeezed by a vise.

David Harsherclasp grunts and scats his way through 15 godlike tracks of vocal heaven before throwing in a bonus track of armpit chirps. As listeners, we are stunned, amazed, appalled, challenged, and literally fisted. Critics everywhere have hailed this as his finest work, his piece de resistance, as well as his chef d'oevre.\n""Everybody Sunshine"" embodies everything that beauty stands for. It is an anthem of hope for all people surviving and living with herpes. ""Wir Zwei Allein"" is a raucous, bawdy German march in the cabaret-style of Brecht. ""Save the World"" is remade as a love ballad specifically for migrant workers- Cesar Chavez would have been proud. ""Do the Limbo Dance"" is a wonderful tune, marred only by repeated use of the ""c"" word. ""Falling In Love"" is a magnificent reworking of Mariah Carey's ""Emotion."" ""I Believe,"" ""Do You Believe In Love"" or ""Dance Dance D'Amour"" are all simple 2 chord melodies accompanied by someone beating their daughter. All this acts as background for David's amazing voice, a voice that resembles 2 mules rutting a rusty wheelbarrow. But I save most of my praise for ""Hot Shot City,"" a song I personally feel is particularly good.";A Soulful Retching
219;391.0;5.0;6.0;"Like many families, we make good use of a good pop album. At the rate we go through N Sync and Obie Trice CDs, joining a record club makes great sense.\nThere are downsides to this practice, though. For one thing, a misguided impulse purchase at a Sam Goody takes a long time to recover from. For another, we often assume we have plenty of Mariah Carey in the CD rack, and rarely realize when we're running out of something.\nMany companies may have fallen into the same trap over the past few years. With Kylie Minogue tepid at best, firms  presumed the inventory they had on hand was entirely  sufficient to satisfy demand. In fact, reducing Missy Elliott has been seen as a key to restoring profitability. However, after the economy turned in its strongest quarter in nearly twenty years, The Sugar Hill Gang looks to be positively sparse. Improved inventory management techniques have certainly reduced the need for Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera to hold as much in store as they might have in the past. Technology has enabled a closer coordination of Evanescence and distribution; the latest innovation in this area is L'il Jon and the Yin Yang Twins' request that vendors embed a computer chip in every package, so activity can be monitored even more closely.\n\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Somebody pinch me!

David belts out both verses with the intensity of an orangutan caught in a dumpster full of ticks. And on the love poem ""Good God, How Bad Are Your Musical Tastes, Son?"" he establishes himself as a chanteur of the finest variety.\nBy the time you reach the fourth song, ""Can't You People Spend Your Money On Something More Useful Than This Godawful CD, Like An Electric Hammer, For Crying Out Loud?"" your senses have been overwhelmed by the sheer magnificence of Hathenpolk's charms.\nAnd the song ""Hot Shot City"" bears a second listen, because it is particularly good.";Better than a three-way

Familiar tunes such as ""Du"" and ""Freedom For the World"" have been transformed in David Hurtfulcomments' hands into dance floor favorites. And original love ballads ""Crazy For You"" and ""Do the Limbo Dance"" are also sure to get that same wedding crowd to seriously start snogging, regardless if they are related to one another.\nBut I digress. What I've been meaning to say is that David Larfercramp's CD ""Looking For- the Best of David Keiferchonk"" is a master-work of deep importance and cultural significance. It truly is a showcase for his unmistakable voice- a voice that sounds a bit like 3 midgets wrestling a furious kimodo dragon.

I was soon hot-footing it down to my local record store in anticipation of something very special.\nReturning home, I tore off the wrapper and experienced the momentary  sensation that I might have made a mistake. How wrong I was. As the opening track began, I knew immediately that I was on a highway to the heart of music itself. The intensity of track 2, Wir Zwei Allein, confirmed the impression. Within seconds I was performing a jack boot dance to this stunning power ballad.\n\nThat was just the start. By track 4, Do the Limbo Dance, I was hastily bundling together every record I have ever  bought in preparation for a trip to the nearest charity shop. By track five, Flying on the Wings of Tenderness, tears of joy were streaming down my face. I admit it crossed my mind: can life ever be this good again?\nLittle did I know what was to come. As track 6, Hot Shot City, kicked in, I experienced what can only be described as a convulsive fit of pure happiness.

Your middle class white American is too strait-laced and not typically willing to hear about the lusty underground 'dance of love' found in places like Haguenau or Normandy. And ""Do the Limbo Dance?"" Forget about it. Not in this suburban, food court-eating natin.\nBut one nation's musical punchline is another's pop messiah. Germany has willingly taken David Custardplank off of our hands and converted him into a Teutonic icon of pure, unadulterated rock.

While Dylan's lyrics voiced the feeling of 60's youth, and while Hendrix came up with some catchy riffs, Hasselhoff's work explores deeper themes. Often they are camouflaged by simple song titles, but to be sure they are there. Such is this artist's genius that the songs work on every level. Oh to know what Dostoyevsky might have made of 'Is Everybody Happy', David's profound 3min 54sec meditation on the human condition.\nWith 'These Lovein' Eyes' Hasselhoff - like Shakespeare before him - demonstrates he is not contrained by convention or spelling.

This gift, presented to his diehard fans and new afficianados alike, brings together so much love, joy, and talent that it's hard to believe one CD can hold it.  This record will be remembered as the high water mark for music of the western civilizations.  ""Looking For Freedom"" and other powerfull songs demonstrate David Hasselhoff's utter and complete mastery of music.  You have to know all the rules before you can break them, and David has left no rule, no piece of conventional wisdom, and no heart, unbroken.  This album will be the measure against which all future music will be compared.

What he accomplishes with a microphone and a leather jacket can only be described as pure brilliance. David Hasselhoff wheezes and hacks his way through seventeen marvelous tunes, enhancing each track with groans that bring to mind a punctured fireplace bellows. ""Crazy For You"" is standard love song fare until Hasselhoff seizes it and forces it through his strained vocal chords. His anarchic approach to the ballad ""Flying On the Wings of Tenderness"" can be compared to a prison assault. And the skill that he brings to the beloved torch song ""Wir Zwei Allein"" lends his trademark caterwauling that can't be matched. A salute to David Hasselhoff and all that he brings to our listening pleasure, salut! Viva ""Hot Shot City!""";A surging boil of great music!

Let's just pretend for a moment that he is just a singer, for the sake of critique.\nBut even then, David Hathendorf proves himself a virtuoso in the world of music. He betrays a profound understanding of subtlety and performance that are only enhanced by his voice, a voice that resembles a mother elk giving birth.\nI don't have to go track by track to prove my point here.

449;432.0;5.0;6.0;By this time everyone knows that Hasselhoff is the greatest musical genius ever born, and that this album is the geatest artistic work ever created. If you don't believe me read the reviews. They all praise Hasselhoff's genius, excepting a few which were obviously written by tone deaf idiots living under bridges. However, this review is not merely to praise God's greatest gift since Jesus but also to warn perspective buyers. THIS CD DESTROYED MY LIFE. I can't sleep at night. I can't eat. I've lost my job and can't find the motivation to get a new one. All I want to do is listen to Hasselhoff. So beware unless you are idenpendently wealthy and have no social life.

455;434.0;5.0;6.0;"Some folks probably remember seeing the ""Magic of the Knight Rider"" ads on TV, where ""The Hass"" (no first name given) plays movie themes and easy listening music on the Autoharp. I was never interested enough to keep me from turning the channel.  (I only trust Ron Popeil to sell me something on my large console TV) Well, now I have discovered David Hasselhoff (hey, he does have a first name!) playing folk music of his native Romania -- and I am so glad I did! Let me tell you that I love ANYTHING Romanian, oh, believe me! (is Ron Popeil Romanian?  I bet he is.  If he is not I will tell myself he is.)\nThere are a number of talented artists on this disc, but to hear Hasselhoff wailing away on the Autoharp(a bunch of buttons and strings connected together -- kind of looks like a real harp, only so much littler!) is just incredible. The term ""virtuoso"" is often overused, but I think it is absolutely appropriate here.\nThere are a couple of fast, hand-clapping, tuica-drinking (tuica: Romania's national drink, which makes American moonshine taste like plain water - Hoo boy!) tracks which are just incredible. And, of course, the slow ones are nice, too. Even though Zamfir is the title artist, many of the tracks actually feature the other performers. Talent and humility are just two of his very many virtues!  Oh, virtuous Hasselhoff of the beach!\nIf you're at all interested in Romanian folk music, or just want to hear something different and very pleasing for your ears to listen to, I highly recommend this CD for you to buy.  It soothes my colicy babies! It tastes like pixie stix, or sometimes those wax bottles or those candy dots stuck to paper that you end up eating mostly the paper! I hope he has lots more records to buy!\nOh, and track number six makes me want to jump up and do the native Romanian dance, the Alunelul!  Yaaay! I call it Nadia's Theme!  Ha ha! LOL!  ;)";Nadia's Theme!
462;435.0;5.0;6.0;There have been few artists from the world of the small screen that have made an impression on the music world.  Despite Hasselhoff's success on TV, we can hear from this album that he has been wasted in the acting world.  Often acted off the screen by talking cars and red bikinis, Hasselhoff reveals his true talent at last.\nThe world has seen its fair share of musical genius', stretching from Mozart to Elvis.  Well now we can add one more to the list, as Hasselhoff releases an album that cries out genius on every note.  We have long known that the Knight Rider has been popular for a while in Germany, but who knew that they could have a musical taste such as this?\nMusically this album has been compared to some of the greats.  Names such as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Sinatra have been bandied around the musical press.  It is obvious though that he has based his style on little known British group Pwurg.  It is an album of pure emotion, and I for one shall be checking out his other albums.;Hasselhoff Sings from the Heart

88;439.0;5.0;5.0;David Hazelnut has done it again. After writing tons of outstanding tracks throughout the course of his extraordinary career which has spanned too many decades to even count them, the master himself sat down and selected the eighteen best songs he has ever made.\n\nAnd, hands down, most of them would probably assume their rightful spot among the twenty best songs of all times.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend the song Hot Shot City, because among all those gems Hazelnut has provided us with, this one is particularly good.;Terrific work!
90;440.0;5.0;5.0;Step 1: Go find your favorite album.  Maybe it's Kind of Blue.  Maybe it's Revolver.  Maybe it's Dark Side of the Moon.  Step 2: Throw it away.  In fact, throw all of your old albums away.  You won't need them anymore.  If you have any appreciation for music, you will instantly recognize the genius on this timeless classic, and never have any use for other albums again.\n\nI first found this album in December of 2001.  Times were tough: September 11th was fresh on everyone's mind, the Enron scandal had just broken, and we still had seven more years of George W. Bush left.  It was almost more than one could take.  But then, through what can only be described as the grace of God, I stumbled across this gem.  I bought it and haven't stopped listening to it ever since.\n\nThis album is Hasselhoff at his very best - from the youthful angst of 'Looking for Freedom' to the touching love song 'Je T'Aime Means I Love You' - even the just-crazy-enough-to-work 'Do the Limbo Dance' - this album managed to seperate the utter genius from the blindingly spectacular and place it all on one affordable disc.  At $49.99, you can't afford not to get it.  Asking a reviewer to pick a favorite track from this masterpiece is like asking a parent to decide which child they love best - nevertheless, I have to recommend 'Hot Shot City, because it is particularly good.;Unmatchable Depth

Amazon needs to change its rating system from ""infinite"" stars to ""infinite + 5"" stars for this particular product.\n\nTill now, in my foolishness, I like everybody else had only thought of Mr. Hasselhoff as just the greatest actor in motion picture history. No more...and to think I wasted so many years listening to elevator music from the likes of Tom Waits, Knopfler, Dylan whats-his-face and all the other tin eared fools.\n\nI got this cd last week and in just 7 days have lost three-fourth of my body weight since I cannot leave the couch for fear of missing a second or two (especially track 6). But don't worry...I have now undergone a medical procedure to weld headphones to my head so that normal earthly routines will never separate me from Mr. Hasselhoff's music. In fact the only break is the split second when I hit ""re-play"". Well, I guess no life is without some form of life threatening deprivation.\n\nI was also compelled to tattoo my neighbours 3 month offspring with the entire lyrics of David's timeless effort. He had been suffering from cancer and then cancer called and apologized. In years to come, when that boy is alone and lonely all he needs to do his take his clothes off and look down upon his own body and he will be reminded of David.\n\nThe song 'Hot Shot City' is particularly good.";Order at least 7000 copies as you'll wear them out
94;443.0;5.0;5.0;Without question, 'Looking for the best of ...' deserves a maximum 5 star rating.  The moment the laser hits the surface of the CD, I am instantly reduced to a drooling frame of useless limbs, much akin to captain Pike from the original Star Trek capable of only yes and no responses. Hoopervandarberhamp's melodic offerings are unmatched, much like the sweet sounds of a leaking colostomy bag unknowingly becoming the food supply of a nearby hamster cage.\n\n'Crazy for You' has become my anthem. Dungle Hasstapiss has paved the way for the rest of us leather jacket clad mortals. He has turned a meager pathway into an open fireroad of hope for wonderous achievement. The sounds are clearly dizzying, much like making out with a girl in a parked car, then realizing that its your sister...and then continuing on. Disoriented and suddenly awoken realizing that I am inside of a fossilized KITT with 10,000 hissing locusts only to soon be ejected into a steaming pile of bat guano.\n\nOh and before I forget, the track Hot Shot City is particularly good.;Aural Enema!!!

He hoists up the flag of freedom like a Teutonic Bono, gesticulatin' and syncopatin' like an epileptic mongoose. And wait till you hear his voice. That dang thing sounds just like three ostriches getting hit by a cement truck.

155;446.0;5.0;5.0;"Listening to David Hasselhoff's celestial opus would be like the Sun rising at midnight; there is no word in the English language that does it justice.  Many people here have commented on the pure musical salvation of songs like ""Do the Limbo Dance"" and ""Hot Shot City"", but I will not dare profane such sacred runes with mere words.  His music deserves to be hune into every rock, stone, and mountainside of this Earth.  Rather than focusing on it for purely aesthetic value (for which I rightly deserve death) I see Hasselhoff's work as the culmination of human history.  Written during the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hasselhoff represents thousands of years of struggle manifested in one monolithic work that represents every scrap of hope, charity, inspiration, and above all, love that has binded civilization.  We all deserve agonizing death for attempting to put into words the magnum opus of humanity, for there are no words for an event as cosmic as ""Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT]""--they should have sent a poet.";They should have sent a poet

That voice, my friends, belongs to one Davis Hayferpleebs.\nDavid sings as if his acting career depended on it. And in a way, I guess it does!

It contains songs that make you want to take off your shirt, lather yourself up with Crisco and tackle old ladies at the supermarket. And yes, all with the Jar Jar mask.\nIt is music like this that beautifies and motivates our generation to tear down old buildings and build children's playgrounds. It is the joy of David's pure, sweet melodies that make us smile.

Apparently the package made it to California, but disappeared. Oh, that reminds me, the mail carrier local to my home retired and moved to Figi around that same time, or at least that's what the new mail carrier said.\nFinally after the lawsuit Amazon promised to send another CD over and make sure that it arrived at my mansion. I had moved from Compton to San Jose by this point, thanks to the settlement I received. I began to cry when the armored truck pulled up to my humble abode.

Effortlessly, he leans his big head back and lets loose a cry that causes whales to beach and dogs to shed. It is that poignant cry, the cry of pain, loss and redemption that beckons us to listen to more-  to squeeze every drop of anguish from songs such as ""Everybody Sunshine"" and ""Dance Dance D'Amour."" Some audiophiles have compared David's voice to that of Placido Domingo, that is until Domingo's own lawyers threatened legal action.

Obviously my brother was unfamiliar with the pure white heat that is ""Du"", but when I innocently suggested it, well let's just say, I was unprepared for his vile diatribe condemning the god amongst us, Daiwoo Awfulhump.\n  Obviously he had to die.  The next 6 months were the longest of my life, not only was I kept restrained on a handcart Hannibal Lector-style, but I was denied the aural escape that is Derwin Hufflepop.\n  At my trial the Judge (a shrew-like woman, obviously untouched by the blessed machismo of our lord Huffenpuff) denied my plea of Not guilty by reason of Hassenpfeffer.  I was quickly convicted and sentanced to die by Manilow.\n  My final appeal in front of the Supreme Court was nearly denied until my lawyer wisely played track 6.  No less than Ruth Bader-Ginsburg, Clarence Thomas and Anton Scalia began to gyrate together in uncontrolled passion.  Their decision was swift and unanimous: I was set free!\nThank you Dagwood Humpinbump!\nBy the way, the song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Freed from death row!!!
231;459.0;5.0;5.0;Having read these reviews i excitedly rushed out to my local 'Home and Bargain' and sought out this little gem. As I rushed eagerly to the top shelf I was overwhelmed with joy to see A solitary copy of David hoppelschogs priceless creation sat there seducing - NO  - beckoning me hypnotically with the words in my head 'YOU need ME'. I began to mutter uncontrollably and hastened my step and thrust forward towards 'the precious' - and a better life. What happened next was unfortunate - for Tim Schnutzer at least. Tim was also reaching out to grab the only copy left just as I was making my final sweep to collect what was rightfully mine! What i'd worked so hard all my life for!. I quickly pulled cd from the shelf but Tim had already had a keen grip too and was sweating profusely. Of course Tim wasn't going to give up easy for this and even shouted 'I'll kill you - you worthless ******** . I'll kill you. The CD snapped into Two and my heart just sank. Without even thinking I firmly headbutted Mr. Schnutzer and began beating him to a pulp. I've been recommended to serve a minimum of 15 years in this cell.\nAs I sit here typing this out I can see Davids face smiling at me and I know that when Big Bubba takes me from behind again in the shower I just think of the day I can hear 'the precious' and my life can finally begin. We WILL be together One day David.;Doin' Time
234;460.0;5.0;5.0;"The incredible beauty of this album transcends the feeble categorisation ""music"".  How can such an undiluted, divine experience be described in mere words by such a man as I?  Were I blessed with the linguistic skills of Shakespeare, any attempt at giving this masterpiece the praise it deserves would still be woefully inadequate to communicate to you, the uninitiated, just how this supernatural disc will affect you.  Your ears will tingle, your toes will explode, your nasal passages will feel like you've snorted God in powder form!  Your legs will tremble your anus will contract and you may even become temporarily violent while the limitations of your physical self adjust to the power seeping into you.\nConfusion will reign your world as you try to reconcile this beautiful noise and feeling emitting from the two common-or-garden speakers attached to your stereo system.  ""How"" you will ask yourself ""did I live before hearing this true soul symphony?"".  There is no answer.  Life did not exist in the same form for me, I was an empty shell trudging through the emptiness of a day to day existence, with only my Bonnie Tyler CD's for company and I thought I was happy!  HA!  Fool that I was... happiness cannot come from Bonnie Tyler... happiness is a spirit that lives, breathes and manifests itself in the very soul of ""looking for- the very BEST of David Hasselhoff"".\nBut don't be fooled, happiness is just one side of life, and true to form Hasselhoff avoids the namby pamby, insipid pap peddled by many of his contemporaries (to Hasslehof there is no such thing as a ""peer"").  Nay! Happiness is not the only emotion this disk will convey to your very nether regions!  The sultry oozing discord of ""Everybody Sunshine"" as a standalone track would have shamed Mozart into leaving his requiem unfinished, it's darkness is so complete!  However when taken in context it provides a vital piece of the jigsaw that is life and begs the question ""why are we here?"".  The juxtaposition of this track to the sublime climactic duet with the effervescent songbird Laura Brannigan, ""I believe"", is inspired and will leave you screaming in extasy.  Life reigns - Hasslehoff believes, Laura Brannigan believes, WE ALL BELIEVE!  THIS is what we were born for, this is life......\nOh but for the chance to touch the hem of his garment, this super rugged man of steel, purveyor of the american dream, bringer of unity to Germans everywhere (well in Germany anyway), multi lingual beefcake, bouffant haired king of the beach, slayer of villains and 'Knight' in shining black four wheeled automotive talking armour.\nJesus himself never made a CD as good as this.\nBuy it today and live true life tomorrow (or whenever amazon get it in that little brown cardboard thing to your door).\nFinally I'd like to request that for this album only they should have a ten star option.\nThe song ""hot shot city"" is PARTICULARLY good!";"the sound of your new life; ten out of five"

If I had the choice of laying my hand on an oak table and hitting it as hard as humanly possible with a framing hammer -or- listening to this Hasslesnorf album, I would choose the hammer every single time.

289;468.0;5.0;5.0;"For tool long has David Hasselhoff been neglected as a songwriter, arranger and vocalist of the pop scene. Well, after hearing this collection of hits, there is no one who can deny that he has some musical talent.\nFor sheezy, he is a master of the German ballad. Like a Nordic god, he lays it down smooth and sprinkles some crumbs of groove on top. And he's not a prosititute, but he'll give you what you want: ""Je T'aime Means I Love You"" is a love poem to all the men in Chinatown who supported him during his formative years. ""Freedom For the World"" is a naughty palindrome about migrant farmers. And ""Tell Me I'm Pretty"" is a spoken-word skit where he pretends to be a young, chubby Tina Yothers.\nThe compilation is just astonishing. Never has such a perfect collection of hits (never released in the U.S.) been released in the U.S. The play order and length of each song has been carefully thought out, if not spell-checked. And fans of David Hasselhoff will be so glad to learn that they don't have to buy both of his previously released albums to have all 18 of his hits. Now on one CD can everyone dance and groove to the sounds of his distinctive voice, a voice that sounds just like a cobra mauling 8 woodchucks in a tool shed.\nGod, the song ""Hot Shot City"" is good.";Sensationalissi-ma-bellisimo!
291;469.0;5.0;5.0;"To begin with you think, christ whats happened to make this man like this... I mean is he some sort of evil genius or is he truly blessed by the spirit.  There are moments on this album which can cause so much pain you will think you're actually dying.  David has managed to blend electro guitar pop with drum sounds from the early 1980's into a twisting tornado of an album.  The drums in fact are very special, I never thought I'd hear these kinds of sounds again, it just goe's on and on and on, there are moments however when u question the validity of David's Lyrics, ""I am a man, and oh yes I can"" however for an artist of this magnitude you have to allow a little headway, towards the end of the album I began to feel slightly ill.  I wondered if the emotional rollercoaster david had taken me on had exhausted me, I wondered whether this man was playing with me and my life through his musik.  In a flash I had the realisation and then I knew, I can't say it made total rational sense but in my soul I knew, David is God, he is the lord, the new messiah come to lead us to freedom.  It is clear to me now that this man has a gift that none of us have, he is the chosen one.  The Germans know it we're just trying to catch up.  Can u possibly imagine what its like for David to be blessed by this infinite gift.  He must be strong for all of us and when in our darkest hour we cannot see the light, there will be David standing in the doorway with his thumbs up singing the line ""Trust me child, there's a long road ahead of us"" What a Man!!!

After recovering for 3 days in a small health farm outside Basildon attended by three nurses I now feel ready to comment on this magnificent opus. The tempo is compelling, the timbre mind numbing, and the hairs on the cover of my couch stood up in admiration! The great one's voice is simply phenomenal, and his vibrato can only be described as a man driving a tractor over a ploughed field with weights tied to his scrotum!\nThe song Hot Shot City is particularly good!;The Legend Lives On!
325;473.0;5.0;5.0;"The thing that most people don't know about David Chankenchonk is that he is actually a classically trained vocalist. His career at Juilliard is legendary- he amazed almost every vocal professor there with his personal rendition of  ""She's Crafty."" Another story recounts an incident where he had a 'sing-off' with fellow student Maria Callas. Needless to say, she didn't stand a chance.\nBut beyond the lore and the gossip, it's knowing how deeply and personally David Chankenchonk feels about his craft. He takes personal pride in straining his vocal cords as hard as he can until he approximates the music notes he wants. The general effect resembles four cows falling down a spiral staircase.\nThis collection commemorates 18 years in Chankenchonk's career as a singer. It's not surprising that it's difficult to find in record stores- the best music always is. But once you find this golden CD, hold it, hug it, spin it on your lap. But just enjoy it for the true beauty that it is.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good.";Staggering in its amazing-ness
326;474.0;5.0;5.0;Hasselhoff moves from strength to strength this album, his hair looks very nice on the front and he looks as if he's saying 'yeah, i'm the knight rider, i can take you' on the cover. He wears red shorts in baywatch and pays playboy models lots of money to run in slow motion. Hasslehoffs tallent is just indescribable, i don't know what to tell you, from 'du' ('you' in german) to 'love is the key', it's one cheesy, corny German hit to the next. Truely Unique.;The Hoffster
331;475.0;5.0;5.0;There are days when it feels as if you're drowning in a world of pseudo-cheesy-pop. The surface of the ocean has closed over your head and you lose all hope. It is at times like these that you need David Hasselhoff. His ethereal voice drifts sweetly through the charts, throws a small red buoy at you and then hauls you, breathless and slightly wet back on to the shore. This is an album that can only be compared with the greatest. Wir zwei allein is reminiscent of the emotive strains of Comfortably Numb, while Save the World evokes a modern day Yellow Submarine. However this is no drug-induced cornucopia, but a melange of styles, blending effortlessly the rhythms of the west with the philosophy of the east. Strings embrace rhythm like incestuous cousins meeting on a summer holiday.\nTalent rises to its level, and that's very clear from this album.;A majestic epic or an epic masterpiece?
334;476.0;5.0;5.0;"And Do the Limbo Dance! David Hasselhoff has blossomed from a demure young proteg of ""Hardcastle & Mccormick"" star Daniel Kelly to a superstar in his own right. Taking his licks for 30 years in the entertainment industry has finally paid off, giving him a record contract and a new lease on showbiz life.\nAnd boy, does he take that opportunity and seize the moment. He slowly builds from a guttural growl in the first song, lauching to an orgiastic crescendo with all the huffing and screeching that a marmoset trapped in a crocodile's jaw can muster in the second act.\nIf you're ever hosting a bridge party and find that you are losing, play this CD on the stereo, and the place will clear out like a roach infested kitchen when the lights go on. That'll show them to beat you at bridge!\nThe song Hot Shot City is particularly good.";Watch the Bay! Ride the Knight!

His collection of songs rivals those of Frank Sinatra, Frank Zappa, and Frank Stallone. The sweet delivery which he brings to each song are like kisses from an angel, and a warm cloud of musical talent hangs about his head and mouth like halitosis. The way he barks out the lyrics is poignant and moving, not unlike the sound a mastadon with its foot caught in a beartrap makes. Just fantabulous. I would go so far as to rate David Hasselhoff among the top 600 best singers out there today. And the song ""Hot Shot City,"" well I think that there song is particularly good, right there.";What a man what a man what a man
390;484.0;5.0;5.0;"Call me an old softie, but David Hasselhoff is a class act that you won't see anyplace else nowadays. His kind of love song is so hard to come by in these overloud, hip hop/ hard rock times. No one wants to sing quality songs about love, freedom and doing the limbo dance. No one but our good friend David Hasselhoff. Through the magic of song, he takes us all back to a simpler time when cars had one red eye that went back and forth on the front, and women with too much makeup on would sit around an office in red bikinis like idiots. Ahh, those were the days. The song ""Hot Shot City"" is yadda yadda yadda.";Shake your groove thang to his wonderful sanging.
391;485.0;5.0;5.0;When I first listened to this CD, my knees started shaking, and my hands trembled. But after I turned down the bass, I heard the most carefree, happy music that I've heard this side of Manowar. There's something about David Hushelfrank's voice that speaks directly to one's soul. Amazing. Even 7 years after its ballyhooed release, this collection of unlistenable songs still remains a favorite among the masochistic and near-deaf. The song Hot Shot City is particularly good.;A musical garrotting!
392;486.0;5.0;5.0;"It isn't easy to get your groove on these.days. Most music out there is just watered-down pap that studios crank out to satisfy the lowest common denominator. Often, they'll find a popular actor or television star, shove them into a recording studio and poke them with electric cattleprods until they wail out the sheet music in front of them. The result is just appalling: the entrapped celebrity, desperate to escape to his or her talking car, plays along and shrieks out the lyrics to songs like ""Crazy For You,"" ""Je T'Aime Means I Love You,"" or even the horrific ""Do the Limbo Dance."" If said celebrity attempts to escape or refuses to sing a ballad, the tasers burn his sides and undercarriage, leaving welts and carbon marks that say ""BMG International"" on them. Thus songs that were already pretty bad to begin with are made even worse by the involuntary yelpings of a cleft-chinned non-singer. Producers and engineers cover their precious eardrums from the abominably ear-piercing caterwauling that's coming from the booth. And it's only after the studio goons have exhaused their cruel tools of torture on the TV star that they relent, freeing the leather-jacketed doofus to roam the studio lot once again and to run along a beach in slow motion.\nBut that isn't the case with this album.

418;488.0;5.0;5.0;"I first heard David's hauntingly angelic voice whilst being involved in a 12 vehicle pile-up on the motorway. I was trying to tune the radio into Ragga FM and suddenly I heard this voice from the speakers that made me loose control of all my senses (I think it was track 6, 'Hot Shot City'), I froze and when I looked up there was a stationary minibus, full of school childen, in front of me. Fortunately I survived, and so did my 38 tonne truck, and I put it down to the fact that David was somehow 'with me' in spirit.\nSince I was released, I can now wear his CD on my heart forever, literally, I have it on hanging on a length of pink string around my neck. Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff [IMPORT] saved my life, unfortunately for the kids at Smegleston-under-Warren Junior School on their way to the beach they hadn't had contact with this music (i presume, but we can't find out now).

David Hasselhoff is truly a talented singer, blurring notes so that you can't tell whether he's singing on key or not. And the way he sings, man, it's like someone dropped a really heavy object on his foot by the way he wails on ""Dance Danice D'amour."" He wretches and huffs his way through some beautiful songs on this album, and I can't recommend it anymore. So I'll stop.\nThe song ""Hot Shot City"" is particular. Good.";Hass is a Gass!

453;492.0;5.0;5.0;My favourite songs have always been those that manage to combine happiness and sadness...until now! The tracks on this album never stray from one message, one hook, one emotion, one general idea - more importantly some of the best tracks seem to have no idea behind them at all. But they all work and they all work wonderfully well! The craft that Davis Hasselflap shows is in his ability to get each song just right (this is no mean feat). He focuses on the essential and creates the quintessential.\nHasselflap has struck out on a new musical exploration. Taking the old tried and trusted (even worn and redundant) musical clichs and turning them into beautifully handcrafted arrows flying expertly through time and space into the hearts of listeners everywhere - although mainly in Germany I believe.\nClearly one of the great thinkers of the Baywatch cast, Hasselflap has taken all the experiences he has gained along the way and transformed them into simple rock, pop, funk, soul, rock `n roll, thrash, punk and romantic ballad classics (he even tries his hand at opera - and gets away with it!)\nApparently, DO THE LIMBO DANCE was a jibe at Pamela Anderson, if you listen carefully you can hear the line `with Frankenstein bits that don't lie down, you'll never win the limbo crown'.  Hasselflap would clearly win any crown he put his mind to - except maybe the `shy and retiring Mr Nobody crown'!\nMy hat goes off to Mr Hasselflap (and my hair too as I am a proud wig wearer!)\nMany people have paid special praise to track 6 and I must say it is particularly good.;Limbo up for one of the all time greats!

A work of sheer genius. I only wish he'd been around in my day; John, Paul, George, Ringo & Dave... Now that would have been a force to reckon with.\nI have to say that after hearing this, I am sorely tempted to hang up my bass and get a job in a chip shop.

463;495.0;5.0;5.0;"When many are asked what the happiest day of their life is, they say ""birth of my child"", or ""marriage"". I have no children since females will not share my bed, so my happiest day was when I put the Best of David Hasselhoff in my CD player. Never have I felt such pure bliss! The music is magical and warms over one's soul with it's touching lyrics. It is almost like David (sweaty and panting from a midday workout) puts his arm around your and says ""hey kid, you're going to be alright"". Then he gets in KITT and says, ""hop in, and lets get a cold one.""\nIn short, this is the greatest album in the world, and my best friend.";A Modern Masterpiece!
466;496.0;5.0;5.0;Looking For - Best of David Hasselhoff (IMPORT) by David Hasselhoff surely such a meagre title cannot begin to describe the wonder encapsulated in the mulleted german rock god's heavenly voice. Unbelievable as it seems David Hasslehoff's extensive repetiore of incredible music genius has been compressed down to this slim volume of classics. The track Hot Shot City deserves special mention I feel I found it particularly enjoyable. I have found The Lord and his name is Hasselhoff\nP.S. Hot Shot City great song;Pure Bliss

475;499.0;5.0;5.0;"This reviewer has to admit to being a little biased here, because for almost as long as I can recall, I have been a fan of David Hasselhoff (I even accidentally left a poster of him in a cake shop in Yorkshire once). I didn't know his talents extended to singing at all but after hearing this masterwork, I certainly do now!\nAnd before I continue, my I say how disappointed I am by the obvious sarcasm and insincerity of some of my fellow reviewers.\nHave you ever noticed how the best albums seem to take you on a musical and emotional journey? You finish listening and somehow you feel indefineably ""better"" than before? Well, this is one such album.\nLike David's supreme voice and lyrics, the emotions rise and fall with a natural rhythm that somehow invokes the great celestial pulses of the planets themselves. It's as if David was truly at one with the whole dimension of creation when he recorded this album and it shows.\nThe lilting, plaintiff lilt of his voice in the slower, lilting moments echoes the deep currents of the pacific, moving in their endless diurnal motion. The power-rock is just so damned HOT that it reminds me of liquid magma - the lifeblood of planet Earth surging through the core of our planet. As your blood too will be pumping through your cardiovascular system as the album reaches it's pumping, pulsating crescendo.\nA warning: don't play this music in your car. I had an almost psychotically intense reaction, at one stage believing myself to be in the driving seat of a black trans-am, and I heard a strange mechanical voice coming from the dashboard. Luckily I had the sense to take a breather by having an olympic breakfast at the nearest ""Little Chef"".\nSo, all in all, and in conclusion I have to say that this album reprasents the sine qua non of any CD collection. It is truly the benchmark that all recording artists should be measured by. Thank you, David, from the bottom of my heart.\n""Hot Shot City"" is probably the best track on the album.";Sublime turbo boosted genius

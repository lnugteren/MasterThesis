Not my fault! As Warner is choosing to still press that atrocity, instead of deleting it, I'm leaving the original review posted.\n\nYes, Warner Brothers, I mean you.\n\nWith all of the advances in remastering technology over the life of the CD format, you should be ashamed to offer such a classic recording that sounds this bad. And that is why I'm giving a one-star rating to a five-star album.\n\nImagine my dismay when I slipped this great album into my CD player, cued up ""Oh, Well"", and was greeting with the tinniest, noisiest (hiss), most distorted and worst sounding presentation of this song I've ever heard. Whatever master this travesty was spawned from sounds many times removed from the original recording.\n\nGranted, the original recording has inherent noise and distortion, but even the LP I had back in the 70's sounded better than this. And the technology certainly exists, and has existed for years, to bring this wonderful recording properly into the digital domain.\n\nTo properly judge how bad this CD sounds, all one has to do is A/B ""Oh, Well"" from ""Then"" against the remastered single version on the now-defunct ""The Chain"" box set.\n\nThis is a textbook example of why consumers have complained about the CD format for so long. In this case, this is horrible neglect of a classic recording, and a pathetic corporate culture at Warner's in refusing to utilize modern technology to improve the listening experience for the consumer for almost 30 years.\n\nWB, where is your soul? When exactly did you lose it (maybe that black day 25+ years ago when you fired Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison and a host of talented others in the same day?). Haven't you sold enough copies of ""Rumors"" alone to afford to properly re-master this classic?\n\nBut then again, I am speaking to the company who has steadfastedly refused to bring its catalog into the digital age until the late 90's - over two decades since the introduction of the CD format.\n\nAs I said before, Warner Brothers, you should be ashamed. You dishonor your company, the artists whose true genius cannot be fully (audibly) appreciated, and the legacy of the pioneers of your company who found and nurtured those artists, all for the sake of the allmighty buck.";HORRENDOUS CORPORATE DISRESPECT FOR A CLASSIC RECORDING!
19;3.0;5.0;94.0;"It's taken 44 years for this original 1969 UK LP version of ""Then Play On"" to finally appear on CD!  This was the swan song album of the original Fleetwood Mac founded by Peter Green in 1967.  This final incarnation of this group included Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer & Danny Kirwan (guitar & vocals), John McVie (bass) and Mick Fleetwood (drums).\nSince the earlier days of CD we have had to be content with the inferior American version of this album.  This new remaster of ""Then Play On"" reflects the multitrack technology of the time.  It was not a very dynamic sounding recording in the first place, however this new digital transfer gives us what's on the master tapes with more punch.  At last we have the original 54 minute edit of the UK LP running order along with bonus tracks of the last two 45 singles from this group, ""Oh Well"" (Parts 1 & 2), ""The Green Manalishi (with the Two Prong Crown)"" and ""World in Harmony"".  The total playing time for this new CD reissue with it's original feel and segues is a generous 69:53.  All tracks are Stereo except for ""Oh Well"" (in it's original mono mix).  Also included in the booklet are 8 pages of fascinating new liner notes and graphics.\n""Then Play On"", one of the masterpiece British albums of the late 60's, alongside John Mayall's ""Bare Wires"", demonstrated how the British blues movement had evolved into a polished art form all of it's own.  The darkness of ""Then Play On"" anticipates the murkiness of ""Exile on Main St."" by the Rolling Stones 3 years hence.  We will never know where this Fleetwood Mac might have gone next...\nThis is a desert island disc.";AT LAST IN 2013 THE MASTERPIECE UK VERSION ARRIVES!
38;4.0;5.0;95.0;"First and foremost, Jeremy Spencer does not play on this album. Although a great player, (Kiln House is his best contribution to the band) the sounds you hear were created by Kirwan and Green.\n\nI cant begin to say how fresh this album sounds, every time I put it on. While still able to bring you back to that warm 60's sound, it never sounds dated. This is FM's first serious departure from the straight blues which appeared on previous efforts thanks to, IMHO, Kirwan's presence.\n\nJust a young lad of 20 his maturity as a song writer is brilliantly evidenced in the first track ""coming your way"". The song changes from a groovy little number to a heavy ending, reminiscent of I want You (Shes so heavy). Only heavier and louder. From here Kirwan flawlessly moves from said number to the dreamy instrumental ""my dream"" and other beautifully sad songs like ""When you say' and ""Although the sun is shining"".\n\nHow is it possible for him to get no recognition in the annals of music history? To me its simply an indication that people simply don't know their music, and are too willing to accept the Claptons, Santanas and (insert other overrated player) as ""the"" guitar players.\n\nKirwan constantly gets labelled as ""Green's protege"" when in fact Kirwan could keep up with Green's masterful playing as demonstrated on Fighting/Searching for Madge. As a songwriter, Kirwan tapped into music in a way that only the most talented musicians could do. He looked to the past for influece, while still incredibly ahead of his time, writing songs the likes of Cobain would write 20 years later. To write songs like he did, and play as he did, at such a young age, is a testament to his brilliance.\n\nSpeaking of brilliance, enough cant be said of Green's guitar playing either; not to mention his singing. If he had to leave after an album, Im glad it was this one. ""Before the beginning"" is one of my favourite album closers and ""Oh well"" has to be one of the greatest rock riffs ever written. Listen closely to Green and Kirwan interplay; these guys were meant to jam together. Page(not overrated)was hugely influenced by Green; just compare ""Showbiz blues"" to Zep III.\n\nGreen's playing had a raw power, a really special quality that no other guitarist, save Kirwan, could harness. This album demonstrates this ability all too well.\n\nThis of course could not be so without one of the best rhythm sections in music history. They are the rare breed of musician who knows when to shut up and when to speak up. Every note, every beat is exactly as it should be. Transitions are flawless, (F/S for Madge, ending of ""coming your way"") and this album makes them sound full, heavy and just plain ol' great!\n\nCome to think of it, I believe I may have already reviewed this album(or was it Kiln House, Future Games or Bare Trees?...cant remember, but you should get these anyway) Either way, listening to this album does just that; it makes you want to tell people about it over and over again. I hope that this lineup, which is shrouded by that monster ""Stindsay Buckinnicks"", will earn their rightful place as the lineup representing this band's creative peak. That is to say, once Danny Kirwan left the band, they lost that sound that made this band so special, and gained two members who were so generic, so bland, so very ""easy listening"". Please enjoy!";One of the most underrated masterpieces of the 60's..despite production
11;5.0;5.0;25.0;"Finally!  ""Then Play On"" the way Peter Green wanted us to hear it.  ""Under Way"" falls right into ""One Sunny Day."" The ""ssh"" at the end of ""Although The Sun Is Shining"" falls right into ""Rattlesnake Shake.""  I have to admit that I grew up on the US November '69 release, and that one is a good, arguably better running order.  But this one is what Pete released.\n\n""Then Play On - Deluxe Edition"" is the best audio version of this album to date. All of the drop outs on previous CD versions are gone.  This is particularly noticeable on ""My Dream"" which always sounded like an 8-track tape jostling against the tape head.  The CD artwork shows tape reels that look like master tapes but I question if this was taken from the masters.  There is no mention in the CD liner notes.  I had heard they were badly damaged or gone completely.  So you audiophiles may be disappointed. But I am quite pleased.  It sounds as good if not better than most of the other albums from that era.\n\nMy concern going in was ""Oh Well'"" being included as bonus tracks in the form of the single, Part 1 & Part 2. However, unlike the Part 1 single version that appears on ""25 Years - The Chain"" boxed set, this one does not fade out.  It has a hard stop and then Part 2 falls right in.  The result is that it sounds like the Parts 1 & 2 version that Warner's cobbled together for the November '69 US release.  Again, the audio quality is the best yet.  I had hoped that someone would join both parts without the repeat, giving the actual running time of seven minutes.  But since it was never released that way, I won't complain.  It's easy enough to make your own edit now that both parts are released as separate tracks.\n\nThe other two bonus tracks are Peter Green's last single with the group.  ""The Green Manalishi"" sounds slightly better than other releases.  But the disc ends on a fittingly weird high note.  ""World In Harmony"" is not the same version from ""Show Biz Blues."" I assume it is the original single.  The lead guitars are mixed with a bit of reverb/echo that ultimately sounds like a symphony of guitars - in harmony.\n\nSo in the end, buy this disc! Peter Green has provided an audio account of his feelings during that period of his life, however disjointed.  There are a range of emotions that appear in no particular order throughout the disc. The moods are powerful, funny, sad, scary and touching, amongst others.  They are all heartfelt.  In essence, this is what the blues is all about.  Congratulations Peter!  ""Then Play On"" is an aptly named genuine blues album that was and is like no other.";Finally!
2;6.0;5.0;5.0;I love Peter Green's guitar playing and the killer bass...the jams blow me away every time.;Blows me away.
14;7.0;5.0;15.0;I usually don't like to be mean to the ones who don't like this version remastered, but to those who said that the remastering on this is not that great, well you guys are drinking your bathwater. I have owned the original cd version, three different versions of vinyl, and vinyl transfered to cd, and this new remastered edition is awesome, the sound quality is great don't let anyone tell you different. Also the fact that they went to the archives and made the original UK version complete is the biggest plus, underway syncs with one sunny day, and the laughing before Like Crying and not on the end of Fighting for Madge is back. So they put Oh Well in two tracks like the single , except no fade in part 1, so it still sounds like the full version even if the tracks are separate. plus the single of Green Manalishi b/w the beautiful World in Harmony gives this the complete then play on,( even though the latter single was done after the album's release). All I can say is it's about fricken time this back catalouge of FM has proper remastering it has needed. great job, now it's time to release Kiln House ( with Dragonfly/Purple Dancer ), Future Games ( with Trinity and other unreleased stuff) and Bare Trees remastered and released and fast as well as the rest of the Bob Welch era Albums.;About effin time!!!
48;8.0;5.0;37.0;"I can't say exactly why I was so fascinated by this record 31 years ago when I bought it (the earliest American release, sans ""Oh Well"") at a Woolworth's for somewhere around $3.50.  I was probably drawn to the cover, which was certainly colorful and mysterious.  (In those days, I could afford to buy interesting-looking music just because of the album cover.)  After a couple of puzzled listens, I decided this would be my favorite rock album of all time.  Again, I can't say exactly why.  Perhaps it was the blues at the heart of it or the enthusiasm in the music.  Except for Green, the musicians possessed no more than the talent you'd expect from a rock record, but there was something different about it, something genuine, even heartfelt.  Later, much later, after delving into these guys' lives and subsequent extremely checkered careers, I came to understand that it was their sheer good fortune at the time to be thrown together during a period of extreme (and often acid-fueled) ferment in music (as well as everything else).  They came out of the blues, but they listened to the Dead, the Doors, and any number of other innovative bands, and they put that extensive, authentic, dangerous, diverse experience to good use.  This is still my favorite rock album, and for more than sentimental reasons.  It holds up.";It Holds Up
18;9.0;3.0;14.0;"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2013 CD REMASTER ***\n\nOK - here goes.\n\nTHE LP: When ""Then Play On"" was first released on vinyl in the UK and USA in September 1969 - fans found that the album differed on both sides of the pond. The British LP had 14 tracks while the USA issue had only 12 - and a slightly different track running order. To add further confusion to the album's history - the split 7"" single ""Oh Well"" became a sizeable chart hit in the UK in September and radio presence in the USA in November 1969 - so Reprise USA decided to relaunch the US album that November with 11-tracks - this time incorporated the hugely popular ""When I Talk To God..."" song. But instead of including ""Oh Well"" split into Part 1 and Part 2 (like the UK single) they edited it together as one long song with a tiny amount of repetition added on in error (the American album version runs to just over 9 minutes). The two Danny Kirwan tracks ""Without You"" and ""One Sunny Day"" that appeared on the original UK LP were dropped from the US variant because they'd already appeared on the band's 2nd US album ""English Rose"" in February of that year. There are also giggles and huffs and puffs at the end and beginning of certain tracks that got messed around with too. What this all means is that 1969 effectively saw the release of three ""Then Play On"" LPs.\n\nTHE CD: The dull-as-dishwater basic CD on Reprise that we've had to live with all these decades (released in November 1988) is an un-remastered mishmash of all those line-ups (13 tracks, 54:14 minutes). So for the sake of clarity I'm going to show how this 19 August 2013 Extended CD on Warner Brothers/Rhino 8122796443 (18 tracks at 69:53 minutes) will finally allow fans to sequence all three variants of ""Then Play On"" LP - and the singles that surrounded it (just about). The track number is after each song title...\n\nALBUMS:\nSeptember 1969 UK LP on Reprise RSLP 9000 with 14 Tracks:\nSide 1:\n1. Coming Your Way [1]\n2. Closing My Eyes [2]\n3.

The booklet is superbly extended to 12-pages with great liner notes by DAVID FRICKE of Rolling Stone magazine which also features a Mick Fleetwood interview that is both witty and informative. Photos of US demo 7"" singles on Reprise and boxes of master tapes festoon each page and the band photo that was the inner sleeve of the gatefold is reproduced on the last pages. There's even master-tapes pictured under the see-through CD tray.\n\nThe original British track running order has been re-instated also (Tracks 1 to 14) which for US fans will mean that the album they've grown up with (including the erroneous 9-minute ""Oh Well"") technically isn't here. But as it's a British band and Peter Green sanctioned the UK track list - in my mind Rhino gets it right. Besides the bonus tracks more than make up for any niggles on that one.\n\nSOUND: the original 1988 CD has been described by some as a benchmark on how 'not' to master an old album. The new disc is 'mastered' by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman mastering (says remastered on the sticker but not in the booklet?) and isn't really an improvement. Those expecting sonic miracles will be massively disappointed. In fact I think the results will probably ranker more than please. It has to be said that there's very audible levels of hiss on almost every track and the top end still seems muddied and ragged. I suspect this has more to do with the original tapes and how the songs were recorded - but bluntly - on a good turntable my original UK vinyl LP sounds better than this...\n\nMUSIC: You'd have to say that ""Then Play On"" in its English form is an acquired taste. Parts of it sound horribly dated (""Coming My Way"") while ""Without You"" has that amazing ""Albatross"" vibe that sounds eons ahead of its time. One of the albums other great unsung heroes turned up on 1971's ""Greatest Hits"" - the blasting ""Rattlesnake Shake"" (lyrics from it title this review) and here it sounds just fabulous. The re-instating of the two Danny Kirwan songs (especially the rocking ""One Sunny Day"") bolster the listen experience hugely. They certainly show that both the album and the band at that time wasn't all Peter Green. The bluesy ""Show-Biz Blues"" and ""Under Way"" are other highlights and I love the quiet majesty of ""Although The Sun Is Shining"". And what can you say about the truly astonishing ""Oh Well"" (either part) - it's 44 years old and rock magic - every time you hear it - it has the power to amaze and influence.\n\nI've had the non-album b-side ""World In Harmony"" on some CD compilation these past few years - but Rhino are claiming the first official worldwide release of it on this CD. I wish I could say it was a bit of a find but it isn't - it's starts out nicely but descends into a rather dull and meandering Danny Kirwan instrumental. You can't say the same for the blistering A-side which astonishes to this day - ""The Green Manalishi (With The Two Prong Crown)"". WOW! Musically - lyrically - what a blast. It would have been nice to have the rare UK Picture Sleeve (I proudly own one) pictured in the booklet (along with other European variants) - but alas.\n\nTo sum up - there's good liner notes for sure, but the sound is iffy at best and bound to divide and disappoint fans who've waited decades for this reissue. The four extra tracks are mostly worthy of the moniker 'bonus' and it has a price tag that isn't some ludicrously inflated deluxe box set rip-off. But in truth - a lot of me wishes this was a lot better than it is.";"""...Baby You Gotta Rock..."" THEN PLAY ON Remastered & Expanded"
13;10.0;4.0;10.0;"Some might find it hard to believe that before their success with albums such as Rumours and Tusk, Fleetwood Mac was actually a blues rock band then they were formed by guitarist Peter Green in 1967. Fleetwood Mac's third album, Then Play On, is often considered by many to be their best effort when Green was in the band. The album is also the last the band would make with Green, as he left the band a year after the album's release in 1970. Now in 2013, the album has been reissued and remastered with the original UK tracking list and segues.\n\nFleetwood Mac was formed in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green. With Green was guitarist Jeremy Spencer, bassist John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood. Green named the band using the surnames of the band's rhythm section of McVie and Fleetwood. By 1969, the band had released two studio albums- a self-titled debut and Mr. Wonderful. Both efforts were simple blues rock albums and good enough for the band to make a name for themselves. It was also around this time the band added a third guitarist, Danny Kirwin. The band soon achieved success with a hit single in the UK, the instrumental ""Albatross"".\n\nAn album like Then Play On was a huge step for the band. Green decided that while sticking to their blues roots, why not dabble in progressive rock? ""Coming Your Way"" is a great intro and fits with the album cover painted by Maxwell Armfield. Green, Spencer and Kirwin all get to shine on this track. Blues comes in the form of the instrumental ""Fighting for Madge"", Kirwin's 12-bar ""One Sunny Day"", the boogie riddled ""Rattlesnake Shake"", and the sorrowful ""Like Crying"". Songs such as ""Closing My Eyes"", ""Without You"" and ""When You Say"" are beautiful ballads while ""Underway"" and ""Searching for Madge"" create this a sort of psychedelic atmosphere.\n\nAs for the sound, it's fantastic. Then Play On is an album that has been retooled and messed with by the record labels for years. As mentioned before, this reissue is a remaster of the UK version. The US version was released twice in 1969. Both versions omitted songs from the UK version and rearranged segues. For example, the giggle at the start of ""Like Crying"" is moved to the end of ""Searching for Madge"". When first released on CD in 1990, the album was changed up again. While mostly following the US versions, the segues were put in different places and once again, omitted several songs.\n\nOne major criticism of the 1990 issue that had fans complaining was the sound quality of the digital transfer, citing that there was too much hiss and distortion. I've done several sound comparisons of the 1990 issue and the new remaster. The 1990 version sounds much louder but very hissy and perhaps a little too much reverb. The new remaster does not sound distorted nor does it sound hissy. In fact, it sounds perfect. I've never heard the original vinyl but I can believe this is what people heard back in 1969. There's no need to worry about any massive clipping either.\n\nThere are a few bonuses with this reissue. Insightful liner notes are written by Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke and there are a few bonus tracks. First, there's the band's hit single ""Oh Well"". Unlike the 1990 issue in which the track as one nine minute track, the song is split into its original two parts like the original 45 single. Also on is another single, ""The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)"" and its B-side ""World in Harmony"". The former may sound familiar as it was covered by Judas Priest in 1979 while the latter is seeing its debut appearance on CD.\n\nIf you were disappointed by the 1990 issue of Then Play On, this is a no brainer: get this remaster immediately. If you are a stranger to Fleetwood Mac's bluesy beginnings, Then Play On is a pretty good place to start.";Remaster of classic album finally gets its due
39;11.0;5.0;21.0;"""Then Play On"" was Peter Green's masterpiece fronting Fleetwood Mac. Featuring the amazing ""Oh Well"", ""Rattlesnake Shake"" and other classic Green songs, it continues to improve with time. While I appreciate Eric Clapton and can marvel at Jeff Beck, Green was THE BEST blues guitarist to come out the UK. Complimented by Jeremey Spencer and Danny Kirwan, this three pronged guitat attack greated one of the most powerful incarnations of the Mac and that's saying something considering how many variations the band has gone through over the years.\n\nBluesy, soulful and, at times, heartbreaking, ""Then Play On"" sounds horrible on this CD issued by Warner. Clearly the mastertapes weren't used here and this album which was mastered back in 1987 is in desperate need of remastering. It also might help to restore some of the material released on the original UK version of the album. I'd suggest re-releasing this great album with its original line up and bonus tracks. I'd love to hear ""The Green Manalishi"" added and remastered for this set (the boxed set ""The Chain"" has that and more. Sadly, that version has only the first half of ""Oh Well"" which was the A side of the original single).";Still incredible but lousy mastering job (review of 1990 release NOT 2013 remaster which is the one to get!)
5;12.0;4.0;8.0;".... well maybe Live at The Boston Tea Party vol. 1 rivals this, but this is the best studio album. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is about the worst engineered album I have ever heard from a popular group, especially the unbelievable amount of hiss they released this with, plus there are several ""jams"", which was the fashion at this time, but which seems more like unfinished sketches for something they could've worked out into a finished composition or an entire performance.\n\nWhatever... this is the album to buy if you're curious about this era's FM with Green at his peak for writing, singing & a superb growth from a blues band to a band that was pushing into it's own new territory with a blues foundation. If you want to really hear Green's guitar virtuosity the Live in Boston vol. 1 may be the place to go, but this is their flawed masterpiece. This hinted at what could've been if PG's fortunes hadn't turned.  And then you also realize that Danny Kirwan is the gem overshadowed by the giant Green, a ferocious guitarist who kept up with Peter in every way save for subtle bits of Green's blues phrasing genius....but for me Danny Kirwan wrote most of the best songs of the pre Buckingham/Nicks era.";Best Peter Green era Mac album....
3;13.0;5.0;5.0;I've listened to this album constantly since it was released in my high school days.  Then Play On is my all-time favorite album.  This version has a different track sorting compared to an earlier Reprise U.S. release CD I have, moving Oh Well (parts 1 & 2) to the bonus tracks and adding The Green Manalishi and World in Harmony.  The sound appears to mastered at a brighter level than my earlier CD version.  Peter Green and Danny Kirwan at their best!;My All-Time Favorite Album
22;14.0;5.0;10.0;"There used to be a nasty habit in the music business. US and UK releases of UK rock bands would frequently have different songs, different song running order, different cover, different everything. In the days of vinyl albums, this made UK pressings of UK artists highly collectible, especially in Beatles' recordings, because on top of everything, UK discs were usually better manufactured and thus sounded better.\n\nWe do not have to worry about such things with this release of Then Play On. This CD features the original UK running order of the songs for the first time with four bonus songs. The CD itself is printed with a replica of the record label Reprise had in 1969. The only difference is the artwork: the UK release featured an entirely different album cover. That cover consisted of a photograph of the group take very, very far away. The producers of this release apparently decided that the original cover artwork could not be satisfactorily reproduced on a CD.\n\nThe notable omissions from the US release were the songs, One Sunny Day, featuring strong, unbelievably phat riffs from Peter Green, and Without You, a melodious gem, both songs penned by Danny Kirwan. These songs were not available on LP and could only be found in obscure compilation albums. More than any other song on this album, these songs typified what Fleetwood Mac was all about musically at that period of time.\n\nThere are four bonus songs, Oh Well, Parts I and II, the Green Manalishi and World in Harmony. Oh Well was in the US release but not the UK release; instead, the record company released it as a single. The Green Manalishi and World in Harmony were also released as a single in the US and UK, and World in Harmony was released in a later compilation album.\n\nTo confound the situation further, there were two songs which were contained in the original US and UK releases, My Dream, and When You Say, but were omitted for some unknown reason later in 1969 in the second US pressing. It all could become very confusing and frustrating, especially if you were a fan.\n\nNow it is all here, no fuss, no muss, as nature intended. Peter Green was taking the band into new, uncharted musical areas. FM had ceased to be a simply blues band and were exploring new musical regions which were not blues, but had blues elements, not rock music strictly speaking, but relied on complex improvisations and long solos, did not restrict the music to a four-four beat, but changed tempi and beats within their compositions, all the while introducing inventive riffs and tones.\n\nThen Play On was Peter Green's last musical statement, his swan song, to the music business. Green would later say at that time he had nothing more to say musically. This is confirmed by the title of his next album, released without his back-up band, The End of the Game. This is album is testament to the journey he now personally wanted to travel alone. As a result those travels, so brilliantly represented in the music of Then Play On, he greatly expanded the rock idiom.\n\nIncidentally do not pay attention to some of the other reviews on this website about the sound quality. The sound quality on this CD is just fine.";As Nature Intended
9;15.0;5.0;8.0;"This review is up to date with the 2013 Deluxe Edition release.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite rock albums.  I remember hearing it the first time around 1974 when I talked my parents into buying my first stereo receiver from Radio Shack (model made by Pioneer at the time) for Christmas.  They couldn't afford (nor could I at the time) speakers but I bought some headphones.  In the early days of FM radio, it was mostly free-format and they often would play entire sides of, or entire LPs on the radio, with FEW commercials.  I used to listen to the headphones often when I went to bed at night and listen to FM until I fell asleep.  One night late, they played this whole LP. I was floored by it.\n\nThis LP provides a snapshot of the entire spectrum of rock and roll at the time (OK not psychedelia, nor Blue Cheer-y, though).  It goes from hard to soft, blues to rock, and some folk here and there.  Peter Green and Danny Kirwan were the best and most melodic & pretty call and response team in the business.  They really show it on this first truly whole LP by the band.  Before this, their LPs were collections of singles.  They show their roots & hearts and the playing is magnificent.  They also show what a great band they would have continued to have been with this lineup, had it survived.  Oh Well.\n\nEveryone who owned the original LP and original CD release knows how awful it sounded.  The LP had the most tape hiss of just about any LP ever released.  It was hard to listen to at high volumes, especially in the quieter passages.  Still sounded better than the original CD release, though.  It was self-produced by the band; too bad they didn't hook up with some better technology or equipment.\n\nSo now here we are in 2013 and out of the blue comes a remastered ""Deluxe Edition"" release, which is actually the original British LP song cycle (better than the U.S. which differed except included ""Oh Well"") plus bonus tracks.  That's a bit of a stretch to call it ""Deluxe"" when just a few bonus tracks are added, but oh well.  What we get now is the best sound ever heard by these ears of this LP, with the best track running order, and it just shines.\n\nThe bonus tracks are Oh Well (Pts. 1 & 2), The Green Manalishi (later covered by Judas Priest and others), and World In Harmony (a beautiful duet between Peter & Danny).\n\nThey've filtered out most of the tape hiss and the instruments and mix can be heard very well.  Beautiful playing and melodies abound, and it really can be appreciated more, now.  Oh Well can now can be listened to without cringing on the tape hiss and distortion.  With the essay in the new booklet, we now know that Peter Green actually played a DOBRO on the track!  Whodathunk?\n\nIf you have any appreciation for the original lineup of Fleetwood Mac, want an introduction, or just a general rock fan of the period, this is essential listening.\n\nI say this Deluxe Edition, with the much-improved sound, the original British LP song list with the bonus tracks, is essential to any serious rock collection.\n\nGood liner notes which tell the story of the days of the recording of this LP.\n\nMy only gripe is for a true Deluxe Edition, they should have included (or have an additional release) which includes a DVD-Audio with a 24-bit/96 kHz stereo mix.  Or, include an entire concert from the Boston Tea Party concert recordings (or other if available).  THAT would have been nice.  But this is still the most definitive version ever released up to now.\n\nEnjoy!";"An absolute classic rock album in every respect; don't miss this if you've never heard it"
16;16.0;4.0;8.0;"Second you say? Then read on......In the dawning days of CD, some of the WORST came from the WEA (Warner-Elektra-Asylum) Group. There was such a fuss over some of their terrible sounding discs that they eventually did something, but as usual with major record companies they did it half-a**ed.  Elektra and Asylum began to remaster their best selling catalog artist's CDs, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, The Doors and so on, but most were just put on the market quietly with no fanfare. To add to the confusion, their packaging remained the same except for a few here and there that had small stickers that said ""Digitally Remastered.""  The only way you could definitely tell were from the new remastering credits in the booklets and, along the inner ring of the CD itself where the code numbers are, there would be an added 'RE-1."" Warner Brothers followed suit, but they didn't even bother to sticker their product, which takes us to the explanation of the title of my review. The first release of this great album was a hissy mess, reviled by all, and with good reason.  Somewhere down the road Warner went back and remastered this along with some of the other FLEETWOOD MAC CDs of the albums following this. Warner also made it difficult to tell if you had the remastered version, they all had the ""RE-1"" code in the inner ring of the CD, but a few didn't have any remastering credits in the booklet, it was hit and miss. The first remastering of 'THEN PLAY ON' was an improvement, the hiss wasn't as prominent and the separations were clearer.  This new 2013 issue is again a SLIGHT improvement, which tells me that they're dealing with hissy masters, so this is the best I think you're going to get. At least they didn't smooth everything out with DNR, and the CD sounds pleasing with no evident ""brickwalling."" With the original UK track listing, the bonus of both sides of the ""Oh, Well"" and especially ""The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown)"" singles and the informative booklet (with pictures of the master tape boxes), they've done it right this time. I wish the liner notes touched on the rumour that there's a 20 minutes plus outtake of ""Rattlesnake Shake,"" but the rumour also goes that both ""Madge"" instrumentals were part of said outtake. That theory is shot down by Mick Fleetwood's tales of recording them in David Fricke's liner notes. Another reviewer also stated that the nine minute version of ""Oh, Well"" on the older CDs was a mistake, that the single version combined was only eight minutes long.  He's mistaken however, both sides of that single add up to eight minutes and 47 seconds, only 16 seconds shorter than the combined version used on ALL the CDs. Now we can only hope for re-remastered versions of 'KILN HOUSE,' 'MYSTERY TO ME' and 'FUTURE GAMES'......\n\nA NOTE: Warner Music Japan has released the FLEETWOOD MAC albums from '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THEN-PLAY-ON/dp/B00DP4M7EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THEN PLAY ON</a>' to 'HEROES ARE HARD TO FIND' on SHM-CD in mini-LP sleeves.

I don't own 'BOSTON' but I do have the separate disc and can highly recommend it, grab it while it's still at a reasonable price! The digi-book sets are pricey compared to the bargain 'MEN OF THE WORLD' comp, but if you're a rabid fan of the Peter Green version of FLEETWOOD MAC they are essential purchases, especially due to the thick informative booklets. The reissue of 'THE VAUDEVILLE YEARS' contains the GREAT out-of-print DVD ""The Original FLEETWOOD MAC: The Early Years"" but NOT the booklet (see above). I forgot that I had ""The Madge Sessions"" when I wrote the initial review but hopefully this additional information will point fans and newbies in the direction of some fine music......";"'The SECOND Remastering Of This Classic Album Gets It Right......"""
23;17.0;2.0;12.0;what a shame one of the most important items of electric blues history does not have the treatment that deserves,this cd sounds like an old casette that played one million times.;blasphemy for a masterpiece
44;18.0;4.0;19.0;"Just to let you know I am not much of a Fleetwood Mac fan. To me, I feel their Buckingham/Nicks-era material is vastly overrated, and overexposed. If it wasn't for the fact the music of that era was overly commercial, and overplayed to death, the well-publicized soap operas, ego clashes and drug abuse from the band members is enough to make me puke. I find some of the Bob Welch-era material good (particularly Bare Trees and Mystery to Me), but some of their material a bit uneven (particularly Penguin). Then Play On, released in 1969 consisted of Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, a young Danny Kirwan (not yet 20 when this came out), and of course Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. I heard English Rose as well, with the same lineup, but I thought it was too straight-up blues for my liking (I'm not a blues fan, but I'm not bothered when certain rock bands, like Jethro Tull explored the blues since it still sounded rock enough for my tastes), so I was surprised I'd like Then Play On as much as I do. The band was moving away from the blues, which was actually a good move here. The music is actually more eclectic, with some killer jams (""Fighting For Madge""), acoustic ballads (""Closing My Eyes"", ""When You Say""), hard rocking numbers, and of course a couple of bluesy numbers like ""Show-Biz Blues"" (although with a more rock quality than their previous efforts). My version is the American Reprise LP without ""Oh Well"" and with ""When You Say"" instead. Many people believe Fleetwood Mac moved away from the blues when Green left, when in reality they were already moving away from the blues when he was still in the band. I can truly recommend Then Play On to even those who thought they couldn't stand Fleetwood Mac (which I don't blame if having to be exposed to the likes of ""Dreams"", ""Go Your Own Way"", and ""Don't Stop"" constantly). Way better than Rumours will ever hope to be, and it comes with my recommendation.";My favorite Fleetwood Mac album
12;19.0;5.0;7.0;"FLEETWOOD MAC-THEN PLAY ON (DELUXE EDITION)For anyone previously unfamiliar with this album, it is long overdue for you to become acquainted with its musical mastery. it is the 3rd and last album Peter Green appeared on, of the band he formed and named after his rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, post their participation in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Green's vision and participation is great, but for me it is the addition of young guitar prodigy Danny Kirwan that really makes the lineup incredible. The mostly absent contributions of guitarist Jeremy Spencer are not much missed as his work led Fleetwood Mac in quite a different direction than the enticing intriguery presented here.\n\n""Coming Your Way"" composed by Kirwan gallops open the album, sonically illustrating the gorgeous cover art of Maxwell Armfeld--a delicately-chiselled, wildly naked youth, with airblown flame-red hair, escapes on a dappled grey pony prancing forward through a blazing autumn forest of change, while glancing back over his shoulder on past pursuits (or pursuers; the blues follows behind and who knows what lies ahead). \n\nThere are so many obvious references into the mix that make this album so unique. It is not just a rock homage to the blues. It's quite apparent that Green and Kirwan lovingly admired and embraced the work of Santo & Johnny, the creators of the classic melancholy note-bending slide guitar instrumental ""Sleepwalk"" that was a big hit in 1959. Also, the surf rock theme of the 1966 movie ""The Endless Summer"". There are echoes of the spaghetti western music of Ennio Morricone; the boogie of John Lee Hooker emulated by similar Brit. bands of the era like Ten Years After and Savoy Brown; the mournful vocal style of Skip James; the classical Spanish guitar of Andres Segovia; strains of Japanese koto; bayou taboo and even snakeoil tent revival shows. All in a mixture of melancholy ballads, voodoo, tribal rhythms, blues rock, psychedelia, equine and train rhythms, jungle drums, minor key magic and mystery. The anthemic quality of the hit single ""Oh Well"" seems to foreshadow the coming of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"". So, this album is both influenced and influential, and unlike any other Fleetwood Mac before or since. Both the voices and guitars of Green and Kirwan master the art of harmonic pairing and gorgeous sense of melody as well as the balance of masculine and feminine.\n\nI must have had about 5 versions of this album, as it's my favorite rock album of all time, despite its being mucked about by various labels and pressings. The latest version is a re-ordering of its original UK vinyl release, plus bonus tracks.  I'm not particularly an audiophile, and there have been many complaints that the previously issued version was poorly mastered. I have avidly listened and adapted each and every time to the sound quality and reordering of tracks including missing tracks, different sequencing, adding of tracks and bonus cuts. This time is no different. I will learn to love it in its new version all over again. No matter how it's diced or tossed, it's a grouping of songs that's so utterly amazing that it's pretty hard to ruin. I haven't listened to the previous version and this newly remastered version side by side, but while finding this pleasing to the ear, I find nothing in the new remastering that is such a revelation as to knock me on my ass.\n\nOne minor complaint I had is the disturbing break-in to the closing of the track ""Underway"" with the abrupt opening bars of ""One Sunny Day"". It just sounded so unexpectedly intrusive to my ear and I would rather have enjoyed a few seconds fadeout of the first before embracing the second. But, then I read various notes indicating that the original UK version was released this way and the abrupt shift was intentional (an element I didn't recall being that way about five variations and forty years ago). After several listenings, I am already getting used to it. As to the bonus tracks added onto the end, I think we've all come to expect that ""Oh Well, Pts. 1 and 2"" definitely need to be present in the lineup whatever that lineup is, and in this, we aren't disappointed. However, the addition of ""The Green Manalishi"" and ""World in Harmony"", while a joy to some, would not be my particular choice. I find much of this album more in keeping with the sounds of haunting tracks like ""Black Magic Woman"" and ""Albatross"", and as such, those are the tracks I'd have added as a bonus, though they would have rankled many, having appeared on earlier albums. I do think their sound is more in keeping with the recording sessions that bore this album than the bonus tracks ultimately chosen. But, one never knows. there may yet be future variations of this amazing classic to resurface.\n\nI urge anyone who does not own a copy of this album, to either download it, or run right out and purchase one. I don't think I can recommend any rock album higher.";My alltime favorite rock album EVER!!!

4;21.0;5.0;5.0;Great lbum, a true classic. In the comments someone said Lindsey Buckingham is as good or better guitarist tan any of the 6 or 7 guitarists that have been in Fleetwood Mac. I beg to differ, Lindsey Buckingham is a very good guitar player and was the perfect player for Fleetwood Mac when they decided to do a more commecial radio friendly type of lbum. Those were great albums, they appealed to a lot of people and they made or should have made a ton of money. Nothing wrong with that, even musicians have to eat. However, Then Play On to me is a work of art, few albums of it's time or what was to come later on in rock was its equal. Compared to Rumors, well, it's a different world. Look, I like Rumors, but I adore Then Play On. Then again, I tend to be partial to Kiln House, Future Games, and Bare Trees. If you like the commercially oriented Fleetwood Mac, you may not like Then Play On, no problema. If you want to get an idea of what the old Fleetwood Mac is all about, Then Play On is a prime example of that.;Love This Album
7;22.0;5.0;6.0;Fleetwood Mac has gone through several incantations, but Then Play On captures the ever-changing band at its best, most creative, and most insightful.  Their blues is tight, blended, and carefully constructed.  The instrumentals are fluid and dynamic.  The ballads ooze with fine touch, soft singing, and elevated chorus.  How one band could create such a thoughtful album is what makes rock and roll special.  This is their Music From Big Pink, Blonde on Blonde, Revolver, Beggars Banquet.  Then Play On finds Fleetwood Mac on the cusp of commercial success.  The songs are one time different from each other, and at then similar.  I have enjoyed and appreciated this album since I first heard it in 1970.  This new, expanded version of the original line-up is even better.  I am over joyed to have this as a part of my ever expanding, always adjusting, mutating musical collection!;Then Play On is the definition of Fleetwood Mac
10;23.0;5.0;6.0;I'm a huge Peter Green era Mac fan. Then Play On is always considered their best record. And Now It Is! Rhino did an excellent job on restoring the bands intended version. Just the addition of the songs taken off the American release make the whole album flow so much better. It's like night and day, to me. All the instrumental jams make sense now that the songs in between are there.\n\nThe addition of the singles from the era at the end of the album also make total sense as a listening experience. Just put this on and all the way through it flows perfectly. Now it has become the definitive Peter Green era Mac record. It really shows what they were about. It really rocks. I'm so happy they put this out. I love it.;Definitive 2013 Remaster
17;24.0;3.0;6.0;"Five stars for this classic album, but only three for sound quality on this ""deluxe"" edition. I'm glad to have the original UK version, properly issued with good liner notes for a reasonable price. And the bonus tracks are essential, although Man of the World should have also been included. Despite what some others have posted, though, I hear little if any sonic improvement over the previous CD version. Perhaps the original multi-tracks and master were unavailable. Perhaps the album was poorly recorded in the first place. But I expected much better sound quality from this long-awaited reissue.";Remastered? Really?!!
20;25.0;5.0;6.0;"One of the best rock and roll records of all time (not pop) and the best Fleetwood Mac record. For those of you who own the original CD - the two don't sound remotely alike. The sound on this (at least on my system) is far BETTER than the original. Sublime. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.\n\nNow, the things I didn't like. I got the CD and saw the running order was different. The UK version. I admit this irritated the heck out of me and I couldn't believe 45 years later they were still mucking around with the running order. After listening to it, it flows. Wonderfully. I like it. I never thought I would. I ""get it"". On the other hand, you see why ""Oh Well"" was added.\n\nMick's drums sound fantastic - some of the guitar work sounds like the amps are in the room. This is a must have for any Peter Green FM fan. If you don't have the Boston Box, track that down too. Great great band at its zenith.\n\nIt is very disappointing that it took this long (WB) to release a remastered version. With that said, the wait has been worth it.\n\nThe liner notes are just OK. I would have done a better job with the layout and some of the credits. A minor gripe and not worth dinging the stars on the review.\n\nI wish this band had made more records after this. Check this out.";About time this got the respect it is due
6;26.0;5.0;5.0;Wow, they sure cleaned up this record. The drums now sound pretty decent if a little laid back. They no longer distort. In fact I am not even sure what the last record had going on. IT was a total mess.\n\nI recommend this to all fans of early Mac. This is some great stuff here and it has never sounded better. Nice dynamic range complements more bass and separation plus it sounds cleaner finally. The old recording was terrible and this one is very good. Get it.;A fine remaster.
36;27.0;5.0;11.0;"I""ve listened to all of Fleetwood Mac's blues recordings before this album while in high school. At college in my first year, I wandered by a dorm room and heard something that stopped me cold in my tracks - ""Searching For Madge"" was playing. Only a few times in my life have I been stopped cold by music e.g. being in SF and hearing Stevie Ray's ""Texas Flood"" and going What Was That?\n\nI couldn't believe it. Fleetwood Mac had moved to something else that appeared then and still does appear perfect. In particular, I love the synergy of Peter Green's guitar work with that of a 19 year old Danny Kirwin who played in more of a vibrato style - very distinct and powerful. These two guitarists (and other band members as McVie) in songs like ""Searching for Madge"" and ""Fighting for Madge"" danced among each other in the most subtle manner of synergy - an astonishing sound. If anyone remembers the ""tightness"" of Paul Butterfield's ""East-West"" in which Elvin Bishop and the great Michael Bloomfield ""talked"" to each other and twined in ""East-West"", this album has that magical component you won't find hardly anywhere among two lead guitarists. Danny Kirwin in my opinion is one of the most under-rated guitarists of all rockdom whereas Peter Green recieved all accolades instead, which he rightly deserved. Even Mick Fleetwood showed genius then (versus his later pap) in his lower-regions drumming in ""Coming My Way"".  Every song in this album is distinct yet it fits. 'm listening to it now and it moves me as powerfully as it did when I was a kid (""Before The Beginning"" is playing); I can only say this about few musical gems.  And I will always miss Danny Kirwin who became a street person but never picked himself up like Peter Green eventualy did; these genius' had their demons - worthy of a good journalistic investigation.\n\nThis album moves my soul in way words can't define; as I finish these words I'm listening to the original ""Black Magic Woman"". Nah, FM in the the old days didn't get the acclaim they deserved and this was the best of their end before Danny Kirwin left in '72.\n\nI'm giving this album (not this crappy CD recording of course) to a 22 year old friend. Let's see how she reacts to real music.";The *real* Fleetwood Mac
8;28.0;5.0;5.0;"First I will say that this version IS an improvement on the 80's CD that my dad owns, the instruments sound warmer and less trebly than the older version. There is still some hiss if you listen very close, so this may have something to do with the master tapes. Regardless, the album stands out for its songs...\n\nDanny Kirwan joined Fleetwood Mac about a year before this album was released and his presence is felt immediately on the opening track, Coming Your Way. He has a great voice and displays some nice licks at the end of the song over a gothic sounding backdrop. Closing My Eyes is an introspective Green number where he is actually reflecting on people rejecting his religious views at the time; I have an article where he discusses this song. For the longest time I thought it was about a girl but it is actually about God. After the somber and well crafted Closing My Eyes comes Fighting for Madge, where we get as close to the live Mac as possible. Green just blazes on both of the Madge jams and I love how the instrumentals come and go through the entire album.\n\nUnderway is a smooth Green instrumental that transitions into One Sunny Day, which rocks like a Led Zep or Cream song and Although the Sun is Shining is a haunting example of Kirwan's talent for chord writing. Rattlesnake Shake has one of Green's iconic guitar riffs. He also displays his excellent six string bass skills, overdubbed and panned to the right trading licks with his guitar. Without You is Kirwan's best blues number and shows what an influence Green had on the younger guitarist. Searching for Madge is probably my favorite song, I just love Green's licks on this track and you can hear the influence he had on Santana towards the end of the song. Let's not forget the rocking rhythm section! Brilliant. Before the Beginning is a close second favorite. Green overdubbed some more six string bass that responds nicely to his guitar solo. Green was the king of minor key blues.\n\nOh Well, what can you say? It has one of the greatest riffs ever and Kirwan takes a solo sounding like a big band horn section! Part 2 is very well formulated and Jeremy Spencer makes his only appearance on piano. Green's Spanish guitar solo has his trademark great touch. The Green Manalishi is fabulous, I just wish they mixed Green's medieval sounding guitar solo during the outro up so it popped more, but that's not what he wanted I guess. World in Harmony is delicate and it's nice to finally have the original version.\n\nI love the production on this album, Green and co. (including Martin Birch, engineer) had a field day exploiting the stereo spectrum. It's a shame Green quit when he did, their planned live album would have rocked so hard and surely brought them notoriety in the States. According to his brother, Green told his dad that he said all he had to say. Kirwan certainly doesn't get enough credit keeping the band afloat and writing some great songs on the next three albums (Please re-master those too) If you become a fan of him he produced some nice solo material: Second Chapter is charming and well orchestrated while Midnight in San Juan has a more live feel and it's a wonder he didn't put a band together to tour. It features great songs like Windy Autumn Day and Rolling Hills.\n\nIf you're a fan of British pop and/or British blues this album is a must have!";Peter Green & Danny Kirwan's Fleetwood Mac
21;29.0;5.0;5.0;"This 1969 legendary classic has finally gotten the treatment it deserves:  beautifully remastered with corrected/restored running order, plus the inclusion of the classic singles ""Oh, Well (pt. 1&2)"", ""The Green Manalashi"", and ""World in Harmony."" The singles are from same period and perfectly capture the rest of the album's unique ambience.  David Fricke's new liner notes also give much needed context to this confusing period in the history of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nIt was on this album that Fleetwood Mac accidentally perfected a sound that is best described as atmospheric psychedelic folk blues.  The lineup is Fleetwood, McVie, Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan and, of course, Peter Green.

30;30.0;5.0;8.0;"My next door friend and Bassist in my High School Band and beyond, Mike, and I first enjoyed this when it came out in 1969-70....we had picked up on ""English Rose"" and really liked the Blues and Tunes, but ""Then Play On"" was something new to our ears.....at the time we knew little about the players except that the original 3 were from Mayall's Bluesbreakers...at the time of our discovery and enjoyment listening to the LP many hours and hours, we were unaware of the influence of the very young Danny Kirwan and the prescence of Christine Perfect on Keys...I recently purchased the CD, having given up the original LP back in the 70's and having listened to it on a cassette copy  over the years....The guitar interplay between Green and Kirwan is worth the purchase alone...nothing else quite sounds like this recording....the Plaintive, melancholy tunes that Kirwan and both Green wrote and the Rockin ""Rattlesnake Shake"" as well as Green's "" Oh Well""  are true classics for all time....the one thing that pervades through many of these tunes is a loose soulful Jamming that was created as they wrote and recorded....I only wish that I could have seen this Band play live...of course, Jeremy Spencer contributed almost nothing to this recording ,though his slide guitar and on stage persona were integral to the sound of Mac......I never tire of listening to this one of a kind recording...I recommend buying all of the early Mac recordings up through the Bob Welch era with Kirwan still playing and writing on ""Bare Trees and ""Future Games""....then you can get a sense of how unique these players are.....and let's not forget how great and innovative McVie and Fleetwood are as the bottom of this sound...they will always be one of the best anchor teams in Rock.";"Re-listening to an old ""friend"" again."

I found that in the quiet sections of ""Oh Well"" there was much surface noise from a record and at the end of track two, there were actually some clicks. I am not sure why Warners would release a CD made from a record or maybe Caimen purchased CDs from a pirate. You can't buy these tracks on Itunes so having the album is great, but I would prefer a CD from the original master tracks.";Made From A Record ???????

This album is a MUST HAVE to any collection.\nMadge/Searching For Madge has all the mystery of Pink Floyd\nat their Gilmore finest. Three guitars, bass and drums, the masters\nMick Fleetwood and John McVie have had their ups and downs over\nthe years, mostly monetary ups, but none of it would have ever\nbeen possible without one the greatest blues guitarists of the\nlatter 20th century, Peter Green.\nI wish there were more stars, and Although The Sun Is Shining\nwill capture any heart, Rattlesnake Shake will roll any blues away\nwith it's sweaty booze drenched boogie and slide that really does\nremake the Country Blues into a British Blues, and that's a great thing.\n\nNo need to praise the Stones, Mayall, Clapton, Groundhogs, Hendrix,\nRory Gallagher/Taste(second greatest electric blues), Jeff Beck, Yardbirds,\nor early Zepplin for British blues here, we all know the score, we all know\nthat at some point Peter Green, Rory Gallagher and Jeff Beck can bring\nyou to tears, rolling salty late night dancing tears of happiness to feel\nand hear such extraordinary musicianship.;One of the best British Blues albums...ever
40;33.0;3.0;8.0;"I know the Mac blues purists, along with the megafans who think anything FM ever hacked into a microphone is golden, will target this review as ""unhelpful"". However, holding the party line would be the truly unhelpful act on my part toward my fellow consumers.\n\nI love pop...and I love blues...so I can appreciate both extremes of the Fleetwood Mac style. But this is not a 5 star blues album in the sense that it can proudly stand alongside classic blues from Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and the like. Even taken as a blues-influenced rock album, it can't hold a candle to Clapton's best efforts. This however is probably the best effort turned out by the Peter Green era Mac, containing nearly all of their best early material.\n\n""Oh Well (Pt. 1)"" is a straight up classic, wisely included on ""The Chain"" boxset. Here you get the entire 8:56 version and you see why it wasn't a hit as is...it's simply too long. It flags after several minutes of tasteful acoustic guitar and what sounds like recorder. Masturbation ode ""Rattlesnake Shake"" also is a great Peter Green rocker. Green adds one more highlight with moody blues number ""Before the Beginning"".\n\nGuitarist/lyricist Danny Kirwan manages to be responsible for several disc highlights (""Although the Sun is Shining"" is gorgeous although lyrically slight and ""Like Crying"" is a nice blues) and pitfalls (the lyric for ""When You Say"" is abysmal,""My Dream"" is a dull instrumental) at the same time.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nDon't expect it to supplant a giant hole in your musical education, but if all you know of Mac is the Buckingham/Nicks era, you're missing out on some good early music. This is worth having for any Mac fan and most rock appreciators will find it a worthy addition to their collections.\n\n3 1/2 stars.";This is far overrated
41;34.0;5.0;8.0;"I believe this was Fleetwood Mac's last outing with Peter Green.  If for ""Oh Well"" alone you should own this album.  I can't vouch for its transition from vinyl to CD, but this is the blues powerhouse that was Fleetwood Mac.  Peter Green, who along with Eric Clapton, John McVie, and Mick Taylor was a John Mayall alumunus is one of the guitar greats and deserves to be ranked right along with Eric Clapton.  While Green is acknowledged, he really is almost forgotten.  THEN PLAY ON will give you a taste of his great talent.";Acknowledged and almost forgotten....

This track has been shortened and it souns awful. 'One Sunny Day' was Kirwans best contribution to this album and it isn't here!. There was no need to have 'O'h Well' on this album becuase it was on the 'Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits' album (the red one) where it belonged. The least they could have done was to remove the overlap, it sounds bad. Then there's Madge. What can I say? I would like to search for the person who butchered this album and fight him or her. It would make me feel much better. Then, there's the sound quality... The original album (I have two vinyl copies - with different album covers) is one of my favourite ablums of all time and it grieves me to give it four stars.\n\nFor Peter Green fans, check out the brilliant ""End Of The Game"".";The original UK version is the best - 5 stars
37;36.0;5.0;7.0;"This is one of the great classics of the late 60's era.  It's a very unusual blend of blues and other musical genres.  The coda to ""Oh Well"" reminds one very much of the Ennio Morricone score for ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" in places.  ""Searching For Madge"" is the greatest one chord boogie vamp I think I've ever heard, Kirwan and Green play furiously while Fleetwood and McVie keep hammering away back there.  I'm not sure why they put the bizarre breaks in the middle of this jam but it works I guess.  I'm sure I heard Miles Davis borrow this jam structure on one of his live Lps back in the day, maybe Live at the Fillmore?\n\nThere is only one track that I really don't care for... Actually, I hate it.  Danny Kirwan's ""When You Say"" and its highly imaginative ""la la la la la la la la la la la la"" (and so on, complete with counter-point harmony voice) lyric is probably being used in those secret CIA detention centers in Europe where the ""terrorists"" are interrogated.  Listening to the entire tune is torture enough to make anyone start talking.  The melody is actually quite sophisticated but the track is actually very annoying because of those stupid lyrics (or lack thereof).

27;37.0;5.0;6.0;"Most of what's been said about this LP on CD is spot on.  This LP represents the only hard rock edition of Fleetwood Mac (the previous LP's were as a blues band and the subsequent are pop).\n\nThis LP was issued in the UK with additional tracks - that had already appeared on the previous Epic LP ""English Rose"" and therefore US Reprise did not have the rights to include them here.\n\nThe US LP was originally issued without ""Oh Well"".  Within a year, Reprise reworked the LP and added ""Oh Well"" and moved around the remaining tracks.\n\nAs regards ""Oh Well"", they simply includes both sides of the mono single.  It has never been mixed into stereo and the ending of Part 1 is the same as the beginning of Part 2, so there's a section that's repeated.\n\nReprise should remaster the LP, restoring the original UK playing order, get rid of the hiss and produce a new STEREO mix of ""Oh Well"" as the last song, properly combining the songs into one continuous, seamless track without the repeated section.\n\nApparently, someone in the Fleetwood Mac office is stopping this from happening.";Brilliant LP but it DOES need a remastering job
24;38.0;4.0;5.0;"I have read some reviews of ""Then Play On"" which describe the album as a five-star ""classic"" album, but I want to provide a bit of perspective and a slightly contrary opinion for the benefit of people who are thinking about buying the album.  I'm writing this review to hopefully inform the prospective purchaser, who may think of Fleetwood Mac as that mid-70s, early-80s pop band and may be disappointed to hear that this earlier version of Fleetwood Mac on ""Then Plays On"" bears little semblance to that later version.  Then, also, I know that some music listeners read about an album being declared a ""classic"" and think that it's indispensable, and are disappointed when it turns out that the expectations exceed the reality.  Also, this is a review of the music, but I feel compelled to describe the mastering of the ""Then Play On"" compact disc as atrocious, and quite harsh to listen to.  But if you're like me, if the quality of the music merits the suffering, then you'll listen.\n\nWhile ""Then Play On"" is one of my all-time favorite records, this falls a bit short of attaining ""classic"" status.  Peter Green, the founder and driving force of the original incantation of Fleetwood Mac, was (and still is, though his playing now is but a shadow of his former abilities, though still very good) my favorite non-African/American blues musician, and ""Then Play On"", his final record with Fleetwood Mac (except for the ""Green Manalishi/World in Harmony"" single) presents him at his artistic peak.  However, this album is a very good, but flawed farewell for ""the Green god"".  While the good songs (""Oh Well"", ""Before the Beginning"", ""Show-Biz Blues"", ""Rattlesnake Shake"", ""Like Crying"", ""Coming Your Way"", ""Closing My Eyes"" and ""Underway"") are exceptionally good, the remainder of the album is pretty much filler.\n\nThere are three instrumentals on the record--""Underway"", ""Searching for Madge"", and ""Fighting for Madge"", of which only ""Undersay"" has any semblance of actual structure (and it's a beautiful piece of guitar playing).  The ""Madge"" instrumentals allow the band to jam, but for a studio release, their inclusion feels superfluous.  That said, having heard the ""Boston Tea Party"" 24-minute live version of ""Rattlesnake Shake"" that incorporates the ""Madge"" jams (and ""Underway"", as well) within the context of a live performance and the structure of an actual song, I can hear the musical merits of the ""Madge"" jams, but for a studio album, such jams seem rather pointless, as if trying to pad the length of the record.  In the past, the band had mixed original material with covers of blues standards, and it seems like the band wanted ""Then Play On"" to be an all-original effort, but the band seems to have just run out of strong original material.  The remaining Danny Kirwan songs (""When You Say"", ""Although the Sun is Shining"") are musically interesting, but lyrically weightless, as if they were both rushed rather than worked out.  Because of release schedules and studio time limits, it seems that the band's desire to make the album all-original material forced them into recording some half-finished songs.\n\nWhen I think of a ""classic"" album, I don't require that all of the songs on the album be great songs, but I feel that all of the songs should be, at least, well thought-out and executed.  Thus, by such standards, in my opinion (and opinions vary, of course), ""Then Play On"" falls short of being a ""classic"" album.  But it still a great album, with many excellent songs.  ""Oh Well"" is simply one of the most moving, wry, lovely, innovative, and impressive songs that I've ever heard, shifting from country blues to classical guitar in a seamless journey.  The classical guitar of Part Two of ""Oh Well"" is lengthy, but this allows the beauty of Green's playing to develop, grow, and flow at its own pace.  In fact, there is a pronouced country blues feel to ""Then Play On"", with Part One of ""Oh Well"", ""Show-Biz Blues"", and ""Like Crying"", contrasting with the more modern (and non-standard) blues structures of ""Before the Beginning"" and ""Closing My Eyes"".  Then there is the rocking crunch of ""Rattlesnake Shake"" and ""Coming Your Way"" to get your butt shakin', and it is evident that Fleetwood Mac isn't just a ""blues band"" that can play rock, but that this is a band that can play a widely diverse range of musical styles with a world-class level of competency.  Alas, all those instrumentals and weak songs--the filler.\n\nDespite my reservations about classifying ""Then Play On"" as a ""classic"" album, this IS a GREAT album, that I DO STRONGLY RECOMMEND.  It's not ""indispensable""--not for everybody's tastes, certainly not for the unadventurous listener--but if you're interested in hearing some innovative takes on bluesy rock (heck, bluesy CLASSICAL) music, then BUY THIS ALBUM.  There's some filler here, but there's a lot of great music here, too.  A STRONG FOUR-STAR RECORD, and one of my favorites.";Great album, but instrumental filler keeps this from being classic
25;39.0;5.0;5.0;"Yes, that's the saying from which Fleetwood Mac named their third album in 1969.  Curious, but play on they did.  And in doing so created what is ultimately the masterpiece for the Mark II line up of Fleetwood Mac.  This would be the last album to feature founding member and leader Peter Green (though he did make an uncredited appearance on 1973's ""Penguin"").  Peter went out in style....musically speaking, not personally.  No longer content to just play Chicago style blues, Peter was adamant to branch out and try new things.  Mick Fleetwood states that ""Then Play On"" is Fleetwood Mac's first true album and is one of his favorites.  The album is missing one member however, guitarist Jeremy Spencer.  The band had originally planned to release an E.P. simultaneously with the album by the band's alter ego, Earl Vince and The Valiants, led by Jeremy Spencer.  The E.P. was to be a take off on American radio programs featuring Jeremy as ""Bill Schlitz,"" the host.  The program featured Jeremy posing as different bands who were supposedly appearing on the radio show (one of them being a San Francisco psychedelic rock band called ""The Electric Orange Squitters"" followed by a hilarious imitation by Jeremy of British blues rocker John Mayall).  The entire E.P. can be heard on ""The Vaudeville Years: 1968-1970"" double CD set.  Jeremy's absence did not hamper the album though.  Peter and Daniel Kirwan's material made for a startling, innovative record that was entertaining from start to finish and that only slightly touched on the blues style the band was known for at this point.\n\nHowever, fans of this album have been deprived of the original layout for ""Then Play On"" since 1970!  The album was released in the U.K in September of 1969 and in October for the U.S.  Both releases featured a very different track sequence when originally first issued.  For the first U.S. release, Reprise omitted Daniel Kirwan's ""One Sunny Day"" and ""Without You,"" both of which had already seen American release by Epic Records on ""English Rose.""  The original U.S. track sequence, released October 1969, was as follows:\n\n1.  Coming Your Way\n2.  Closing My Eyes\n3.  Fighting For Madge\n4.  When You Say\n5.  Show-Biz Blues\n6.  Underway\n7.  Although The Sun Is Shining\n8.  Rattlesnake Shake\n9.  Searching For Madge\n10. My Dream\n11. Like Crying\n12. Before The Beginning\n\nIn September/November of 1969, the band released ""Oh Well Pt. 1&2"" as the A and B side of their non-album single.  The song was a hit in both the U.K. and the U.S., so Reprise decided to cash in on the single's success and re-release ""Then Play On"" with a track sequence to include ""Oh Well"" sometime in early 1970.  Both ""When You Say"" and the beautiful ""My Dream"" were cut from the track line up and ""Oh Well"" was tacked onto the end of side one.  ""Show-Biz Blues"" was now moved up to track 3 on the first side, ""Fighting For Madge"" was now sequenced directly AFTER ""Searching For Madge"" on side two.  Reprise managed to make a mess of a band's masterpiece by being money hungry.  It's a shame because if you've heard the original version of the album, you'll be astounded by how much more evenly it flows and makes sense.  For a smoother and more enjoyable ride, program your CD with the original track line up listed above and place ""Oh Well"" either after ""Underway"" or at the very end.  I prefer it after ""Underway"" myself.\n\nGreen had five songs on the original release, six if you count ""Oh Well.""  Daniel Kirwan also had five songs, with the ""Madge"" jams being credited one each to John McVie and Mick Fleetwood.  Both Peter and Daniel's songs gave each a run for their money!  Daniel showcased his heavier side with the jungle beat driven ""Coming Your Way"" but for the most part, Daniel's songs are more gentle in nature.  Those being the sad ""When You Say,"" the instrumental ""My Dream,"" the bluesy ""Like Crying,"" and the crooner styled ""Although The Sun Is Shining.""  Peter starts off his songs with the haunting, near the point of death tinged ""Closing My Eyes.""  He follows that with the down home blues of ""Show-Biz Blues,"" the Hendrix like instrumental ""Underway,"" and the re-release features his magnum opus ""Oh Well.""  On side two, he managed one of the first overtly descriptive songs about male masturbation with ""Rattlesnake Shake"" (""Now I know this guy.  His name is Mick.  Now he don't care if he ain't got no chick!"") and again back to his death bed with the ghostly ""Before The Beginning.""  Both of the ""Madge"" jams are heavy and spliced into sections for a fun listen (at one point a bizarre orchestra interlude comes barreling forth into the song for no reason at all).\n\nBy all accounts ""Then Play On"" is one of Fleetwood Mac's best and definitely the best album from their early years.  No Fleetwood Mac collection is complete without this one so it has my highest recommendation!  The Fleetwood Mac Reprise catalog from 1969 to 1974 is long overdue for a proper, updated remastering job with ""Then Play On"" especially needing some attention!

35;42.0;5.0;6.0;If you like blues, blues-rock, English blues, or just good music from a past era, give this a listen.  If you didn't know, Peter Green was the founder of Fleetwood Mac way back in the 60's.  Founded as a British blues group, Peter Green is a most excellent guitarist with a touch and sound all his own.  This is HIS group and this was an American release that was original and fresh sounding as it is today.  From blues guitar to electric to slide to Spanish this album (CD) has it all.  If you're not familiar with Peter Green, give this a listen with and let this CD be a segue to the other original Fleetwood Mac CD's available.;Excellent in every way.
47;43.0;5.0;7.0;"I have owned this lp for any number of years now, and it is one that I go back to a lot for inspiration, or just to listen to. After (literally) thousands of listens, the lp still has a vitality and freshness in it that I find inescapable.\nThe original (and only) Fleetwood Mac had undergone several personal and professional changes by the time this lp was released in 1969. Starting off as a pure blues unit, Mssrs. Green/McVie/Fleetwood/Spencer released 2 great blues lps (""Fleetwood Mac,"" ""Mr. Wonderful"") that cemented Green as a blues legend while in his mid 20's.\nThe release of the instrumental ""Albatross"" gave the Mac a huge hit, but also led them slowly away from pure blues from that point on. As this occurred, guitarist Danny Kirwin was added to the band, while Jeremy Spencer slowly became an outcast in the band.\n""Then Play On"" is not a pure blues lp by any stretch of the imagination. What it includes, however, are well crafted songs written mainly by either Green or Kirwin (Spencer did not participate on the lp despite his picture being included with the band's on the inside jacket sleeve), showcasing their immense talents as songwriters and overall musicians. The gorgeous ""Oh Well (pts 1&2)"" is a clear example, with Green adding a flute (played by his girlfriend) and cellos to the mix. Kirwin's ""Although the Sun is Shining"" and ""When You Say"" are typical of his songwriting style- balads. The band does rock out on ""Rattlesnake Shake,"" as well as the McVie/Fleetwood penned ""Searching for Madge"" and ""Fighting for Madge,"" with Green and Kirwin both getting in some tasty licks.\nThe eclectic song list makes for a complete pop lp that holds up well over time. Technically speaking, the recording quality isn't all that great, but that doesn't take away from the competence of both the songs and the band. far from it.\nPeter Green's swansong with Fleetwood Mac, ""Then Play On"" is a gem of an lp and should grace every cd collection. A wonderful set of songs played by very competent musicians. Who could ask for more?";essential Peter Green

Not a bad tune on the album.

However, should anyone from Warner/Reprise ever happen to read this - the recording  quality is hissy and the track line up is an appalling jigsaw job on the  original UK album. Two tracks are missing altogether and Oh Well has been  stuck right in the middle. The original UK LP track line up was fabulous,  and makes sense of the songs and jams. The only way, currently to replicate  it is to buy the Japanese English Rose CD and to make a compilation of the  tunes in the right order. Reprise, why won't you clean this thing up?!!!!!;The best of thier recordings
42;46.0;5.0;6.0;"This album was a quick creative pinnacle for this group of post-Clapton Mayal alums. A record that was a great jump in confidence, sophistication, imagination, over the band's second album- released in the US as `English Rose' and which bore the Fleetwood Mac originals ""Albatross"" and ""Black Magic Woman"" (popularised by the Santana cover). English Rose (called, If memory serves, `Mr. Wonderful' in the UK) was in turn a strong forging ahead from the band's self-titled debut (yes Virginia, there are two albums called ""Fleetwood Mac"") of 1968 which was pure sad-and-funk blues.\nIf Then Play On could be imagined as a movie, then it would be considered a `fish-and-chips' western. Peter Green would be the singer-songwriter with the voice with no name; because several of the tracks have a deep, stark evocation of the Old West. In my personal case, this impression may have been amplified by the fact I was living in Desert Hot Springs, California (often visited by Hollywood crews in a bygone age when filming background footage for flicks like Showdown at the O.K Corral) in 1970 when I picked up this disc at a Woolworth's in nearby Palm Springs. This southwestern blues feeling is deepest on the magnificant track ""Oh Well.""\nI wish they would release someday the outtakes for this record, because the tracks ""Searching for Madge"" and ""Fighting for Madge"" were obvious sectioned edits from what must have been a most intensive, glorious jam. On the finished album, the jam segments are broken up by beautiful orchestrations.\nThis CD release also contains two extra tracks, one of which is a very fine instrumental, called ""My Dream"" and goes well when placed next to the lovely ""Underway"" which to this day feels like a sequel to the band's classic `Albatross.'";The Creative Peak for the Original  Fleetwood Mac
32;47.0;5.0;5.0;I bought this CD after reading about Peter Green in Guitar Player magazine.  I was just amazed at what a great player he was.  Oh, Well is the highlght of the CD and is one of the best songs you will ever hear.  After listening to this CD you need to go to Snapper Music's web page and buy Fleetwood Mac's Live at the Boston Tea Party Vol 1 and Vol 2.  Peter Green and Danny Kerwin are outstanding and Jeremy Spencer plays an amazing slide.  The CDs were remastered and the sound is great.  Best of all it won't cost you an arm and a leg.  Go get it if you want to hear Peter Greeen in his prime.;Fantastic Guitar Playing
33;48.0;5.0;5.0;"The first of what would become a list of memorable lineup changes for Fleetwood Mac came before the release of ""Then Play On,"" the group's third album in 1969.  The rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood on drums and John McVie on bass, the only constant in all of the various versions of the group (which is good since they gave the group its name), remains the same.  But joining Peter Green on guitar and Jeremy Spencer on slide guitar, was Danny Kirwan as second guitarist.  Kirwan would replace Spencer as the person writing most of the songs that Green was not providing.  However, this was certainly a portend of things to come because ""Then Play On"" would end up as Green's last album with the group he essentially founded.\n\nAt this point Fleetwood Mac was a British blues band, and while their second album was mostly leftovers from their successful debut effort, ""Then Play On"" gets them back on track.  Green writes six of the thirteen tracks, including ""Oh Well,"" the best track on the album and a #2 hit single for the group in the U.K.  I know it qualifies as the first Fleetwood Mac songs I ever heard (""Sentimental Lady"" would be the second, then we wait for Stevie Nicks to show up).  The rapid blues guitar riff qualifies as rock and roll to my ear, with every body stopping so Green can go a few lyrics before the instruments start crashing in again.  ""Rattlesnake Shake"" has an even harder rock edge to the blues, while ""Showbiz Blues"" and ""Before the Beginning us back to the more traditional slow down version of the blues.\n\nKirwan gets the opening track, ""Coming Your Way,"" with its Cuban rhythms and dueling guitars adding to the musical mix on this album.  But his ""Although the Sun is Shining"" is certainly the track that takes the band in a decidedly different musical direction, not that uniformity is a good thing and this track would have fit perfectly on a Fleetwood Mac album from the glory pop years.  Kirwan takes his own stab at the blues with ""Like Crying, Like Dying,"" and the rhythm section even gets some song writing credit with McVie for ""Searing for Madge"" and Fleetwood for ""Fighting for Madge.""  The net result is not as blue oriented as their first album, but instead of a lot of covers everything here is original material by the group.  If Green had not left the group because drugs were messing with his mind and been replaced by Christine Perfect soon-to-be McVie (who is playing on this album without credit), then we would be talking about Fleetwood Mac as one of the premier British blues groups and not as the darlings of pop rock and the tabloids.  Fate is a fickle thing and ""Then Play On"" is one of those albums that focuses our attention on the road not continued.";The Peter Green period of Fleetwood Mac ends as strongly as it began
46;49.0;5.0;6.0;"This was my first Peter Green related disc. I immediately responded to his stinging guitar sound and have since purchased two earlier Fleetwood mac Cd's Pious Bird of Good Omen&the live Shine 69. Both get played more than Then Play On because I prefer the stinging guitar sound on his blues songs more than on the rock oriented Then Play On.\nHowever, if you like a disc that explores rock terrain with blues roots, Then Play On is your disc.  You already know the hit ""Oh, Well""(don't ask me what I think of you/I might not give the answer that you want me to), and you will love Rattlesnake Shake  and Coming Your Way. Be aware that there are some slow numbers on the disc as well. I like them but they defintiely have an early seventies feel to them. Then Play On,less a blues record than a classic rock record, though one with some stinging blues venom  in its rocking veins.\n{Peter Green by the way is once again playing straight blues and has recorded two CD's of Robert Johnson numbers recently that have a very good sound and reputation among lovers of the blues.}";Peter Greens rock album
43;50.0;5.0;5.0;"Completely original songwriting and playing.  Peter Green (author of ""Black Magic Woman"") set the standard with this near perfect blues-rock recording.  ""Oh Well"" is an emotional and ageless masterpiece combining both electric and acoustic guitar and great lyrics.  For me ""Showbiz Blues"" is the strongest song on the album, but one could also argue for ""Coming Your Way"" or ""Rattlesnake Shake.""  I owned this in vinyl a long time ago and wore it out several times.  Although different in style, I rank this music with ""Who's Next"" and ""Sgt Pepper"" in its influence and importance in rock music.  I can't think of another blues-rock album that matches this one.";This One Set The Standard

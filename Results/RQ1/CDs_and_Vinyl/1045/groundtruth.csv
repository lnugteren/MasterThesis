1028;1.0;5.0;665.0;"I fell for the Chicks a few months after Home came out, when I heard ""Landslide"" playing on a tinny tape player in an empty cafe beside a highway, among the pine trees near Apsley, Ontario. The waitress was wiping down the tables and singing along. I thought it was about the prettiest music I'd ever heard. So wistful and strong and beautiful -- just like that waitress and her rocky Canadian town.\n\nWhen I came home, I bought all the Chicks albums (well, the ones with Natalie anyway) and they just blew me away. I listen to a lot of different stuff -- Beck, Buck Owens, Buddy & Julie Miller, Bill Withers, the Beastie Boys, the Beatles, Bach (and that's just Bs) -- but there's only a handful of musicians that really touch my heart. The Chicks are definitely on that list. Songs like ""Long Time Gone,"" ""Tortured, Tangled Hearts"" and even ""White Trash Wedding"" transport me. I'd listen to ""Travelin' Soldier"" more, but it always makes me cry.\n\nAnyway, I downloaded Taking the Long Way right away this morning. And I'm loving every song. The Chicks sound beautiful together, and it's great to have them back. ""The Long Way Around,"" ""Easy Silence"" and ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" are a great three-pack to kick off the package. ""Lullaby"" is the one that brings that pleasurable lump to my throat.\n\nBy the way, it's really interesting to read these negative reviews. One guy attacks Natalie for being (allegedly) fat. Some lady says she'd never buy the CD (and therefore hasn't heard it), but still feels qualified to give it one star. If these are the kind of people who were boycotting the Chicks and causing that whole ruckus ... well, I think their level of discourse pretty much speaks for itself. I don't think we should worry about them.\n\nBut then there are the people who just seem mad that the Chicks aren't playing ""country"" anymore. These are the ones I feel sorry for. Listen, is country music so endangered that fans have to somehow close ranks and attack one of their ""own"" for making an album in LA? Of course not! Like everything else, country music benefits from diversity. Listen to Taking the Long Way on its own terms. I'm sure that's what Merle Haggard, Tim McGraw and even Hank Jr. are doing. If you don't, it's your loss.";Love those Chicks!
4;2.0;5.0;8.0;"I thought I might like Dixie Chicks before I bought my first by them, ""Home."" But then after that political ""unpleasantness"" a few years back decided to buy the album in solidarity with these like-minded musicians. I loved ""Home."" Recently, they came up in conversation with a professional musician I met and I decided to go for album #2. I'm a bigger fan now. It will take more listening for me to determine whether it's better than ""Home"" or not, because I never form a hard fast opinion without several listenings. I DO know, my 5-star rating will stick. ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" makes me grin.";"Dixie Chicks: ""My Peeps"""
926;3.0;5.0;121.0;"never been one to write a review...never been one to rush out the first day an album is released to purchase it...but I did for the Chicks.....it gives me a chance in some small way to give back to a group who's music has given me so much pleasure over the years. The first time I heard ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" actually gave me goosebumps....any album that can do that deserves 5 stars. C&W music stations in Houston had been my steady staple since I was a preteen, but when they boycotted the Chicks - I boycotted them(c&w stations) - now my music library is full of all kinds of music you wouldn't expect from a 40 year old woman - everything from the Blackeyed Peas to Bowling for Soup to the Chieftans....the narrow minded people who turned me off c&w actually broadened my world..\n\nbtw....if anyone in the C&W music industry should be boycotted for offensive and insulting remarks....consider Toby Kieth for his song ""Running Block""(from White Trash With Money).....nothing like offending and insulting every ""Fat Chick"" in America......nowadays there are probably more of them than there are Bush supporters.......";fat chick loving the chicks....
563;4.0;2.0;107.0;"The Dixie Chicks may be multi-millionaires but on this CD they whine on about how tough their lives have been. Despite this compact disc being at #1 in sales, they are still complaining to their buddies in the news media that some of their concerts didn't sell out immediately.  If they have to cancel some shows (""The Horror""), their tour might only gross 85 million bucks instead of 90 million.\n\nApparently now, not only is it censorship if some people, of their own free will, don't want to listen to their songs, or some radio stations, of their own free will, decide they don't want to play their music, but it is also censorship if people, of their own free will, decide they don't want to see them in concert.\n\nI guess the Dixie Chicks and their fans think that in a free country all MUST be forced to listen to the Dixie Chicks, radio stations MUST all be forced to play their songs, and all of us MUST be forced to buy their concert tickets.  Only in fascist dictatorships do people choose what music they want to listen to, what songs they want to play on their own radio stations, and what concerts they want to attend.\n\nI've heard a few of the tunes on this CD and they are nothing special - certainly nothing to make me want to buy it.  I've heard worse but the production of this one stinks.  But the main problem is all of the whining vocals that are hard to take from a group of super wealthy bimbos.  I wish I had their ""problems"" if it came with their fortunes.";It sure is tough being multi-millionaire pop singers!
580;5.0;2.0;107.0;"Listen to the music: If you think that it deserves a five star rating I've got my little sister's used ""Britney Speares"" CDs to sell ya.  I guess highly commercial pop appeals to many out there (or is it their politics?), but I prefer serious music. This stuff is like a cross between Stevie Nicks and Rick Astley.";Not for Everyone
659;6.0;4.0;106.0;"Just because this Canadian boy hates America doesn't mean that he hates all Americans.  The Dixie Chicks may not come across as especially bright when you see them interviewed on TV but at least their heart is in the right place.  The music is above average pop although it is highly commercial.  If you want to hear music with more of a message, I recommend fellow Canadian Neil Young's latest or, my favorite, Green Day's ""American Idiot.""";I hate America - But I like the Dixie Chicks!
516;7.0;1.0;102.0;"Initially, I didn't think this album was worth reviewing; but, the whiny single is so silly and pathetic it could not be helped.  The NRTMN single is basically a temper tantrum insisting that the Chick's are just ""not ready"" to forgive the people who disagree with them.  Excuse me, but I don't remember anyone apologizing to them in the first place.  Apologize for what?  Just as these ladies have the right to state their views; people have the right to react to it in any way they please.  How ridiculous that these girls think someone is apologizing to them for disagreeing.  Typical whiny Hollywood elitists who think they can state their opinions and no one can disagree.  These girls are tired and angry.\n\nAlso, how offensive that severel reviewers say that ""republicans are racist"".  Excuse me; but, I am black.  I am a Republican.  I can vote, think, believe whatever way I choose.  I don't have to subscribe to the liberal dogma that I believe to be destructive to my people just because some uppity, white suburban housefrau (who's never been to my neighborhood or one like it) says some ignorant lie about a political party.  (Pat)  Please stop assuming that you speak for me.  Your attempts to keep my people slave to one politcal party is your way of keeping us powerless.  That's not happening anymore.  We have the right to diversity of thought, too.";Silly
493;8.0;2.0;88.0;I hate to admit it, but I was swept up in the pro-Dixie chicks media hype that followed the release of this CD.  I bought it after hearing only two songs and was quite disappointed.  They had waited a while to release a new album and so you would have thought they would have produced a more solid effort.\n\nI would have to say that there are production problems that make much of the sound far too diffuse. And then there are the lyrics and Ms. Maine's tone of voice: All the whining is a bit hard to take from a group of extremely rich ladies.  One song is even about one of the Chicks difficulties getting pregnant. They are even complaining now to the press about weak concert ticket sales in some markets, as if they have some kind of inherent right to sell out every show.  Their CD is #1 in sales and they should be happy, but instead they're still whining!;They should change their names from the Dixie Chicks to the Sob Sisters
593;9.0;2.0;87.0;"I wrote a critical review of the Dixie Chicks CD a couple of days ago, and now it disappeared.  I've noticed other reviewers saying the same thing, and I've read negative reviews of this Cd that disappear a few hours later. It is kind of ironic given that many of the Dixie Chicks supporters cry ""freedom of speech.""\n\nThe music on this CD, which includes a lament about infertility, is pretty unexiting given all the controversy.  I keep reading that the Dixie Chicks are ""brave"" but it doesn't take bravery to come out and say that you've changed your mind (again) and are now against Bush (again) when his approval ratings are as low as they are now.  It would have been brave to stick to your guns back when he was more popular. The Dixie Chicks waffling is pretty pathetic.";The Wet-Noodles of Country are Trying to Become the Wet-Noodles of Pop
483;10.0;2.0;86.0;"You've got to feel sorry for all those Dixie Chicks fans who made fools of themselves writing reviews here at Amazon claiming that the Dixie Chicks were ""patriotic,"" only to have Ms. Maines pull the rug out from under them. I looked over the five-star and ""most helpful"" reviews and saw dozens claiming that the Dixie Chicks are patriotic and that their critics are ""un-American.""  Pro-Dixie chicks zealots have put tags like ""patriotic"" and ""true-Americans"" here at Amazon, and the Amazon review with the fourth highest number of ""most helpful"" votes is titled, ""Patriotism Put to Music."" Unfortunately for them, Ms. Maines has now told journalists that she is AGAINST the very idea of patriotism. PATRIOTISM IS BAD! Don't love your country Dixie Chicks fans!\n\nThe music on this CD is standard pop, except for the awful singing.  Other reviewers have used the word ""whining,"" and I think that is appropriate.  They lost fans with their attempts at political statements and a few country radio stations stopped playing their music.  But most radio stations played their music as before, they continued to sell CDs, and their 1993 concert tour was the biggest moneymaker of the year. After taking some time off to have babies and enjoy their megamillions, their new CD is #1, and they are poised to have another record breaking concert tour.  Gazillionaires like the Dixie Chicks should stop whining.";You can't be a PATRIOT and an ANTI-PATRIOT at the same time
700;11.0;3.0;77.0;You can give the Dixie Chicks credit for trying but, let's face it, they aren't the real thing.\n\nFirst of all, radical women don't dress like tarts and wear lots of make-up.  They aren't supposed to look like sex objects.  Put the jeans back on and stop shaving your armpits!!!\n\nSecondly, the songs should be about the evils of Bush, the American military, capitalism, racism, etc.  They should not be about you, yourselves, and us.\n\nThirdly, if you really were radical you would never have acted like cowards and apologized the the Bush remarks and then waited years, when Bush's ratings tank, to change course (again) and claim that you meant it the first time.;Not Radical Enough!!!
638;12.0;2.0;76.0;I read all the great reviews about this CD and so I bought it.  Now that I've listended to it, I can say that it is grossly over-rated and over-hyped.  As other reviewers have noted, it is overproduced and the sound is poorly mixed.  The music on most of the songs is a real mish-mash.;WOW! IS THIS CD OVER-RATED
497;13.0;3.0;74.0;"And most of the hate seems to come from the five-star reviewers instead of those who give one-star. Some of the Dixie Chicks lovers express a desire for violence that I haven't seen in any of the anti-Dixie Chicks reviews. One review from a Dixie Chicks fanatic (below) talks about kicking a part of the body of those he disagrees with, while another's review says ""here's a thumb in your eye"" to those out there who dare not share his adoration of the trio from Texas.\n\nAnother theme of many five-star and one-star reviews is that either the Dixie Chicks are unpatriotic or that they are patriotic and those who don't like the Dixie chicks are ""un-American."" I've read at least two five-star reviews that tell those who don't share their enthusiasm for the ladies to move to another country.  Unfortunately for the five-star reviewers, I just read in the news that the Dixie Chicks have given an interview with the British press in which they denounce patriotism.  I guess the one-star reviewers were at least right about something. All those five-star reviewers who claimed they were patriotic now look pretty dumb!\n\nI think that the CD is alwright but nothing special.  Too many of the songs have too similar a sound.  I don't think it is bad enough for a one-star review or good enough for five-stars.  Unfortunately, a lot of people out their seem to rate the CD based on their political inclinations rather than the music.";I've never seen so much HATE in Amazon reviews before
805;14.0;3.0;73.0;"If you actually listen to the music on this album, you'll find some decent tracks, I especially liked ""lullaby"" despite it's simplicity, but you'll find a lot of not so good ones too.  This is an average album that, like so many others that are being churned out by the music companies, contains some songs designed to get airplay and lure buyers, but mostly has boring stuff meant to take up space.  Why can't we get solid products anymore? The Dixie Chicks sure have had plenty of time to create one.\n\nIt seems like, unfortunately, many reviewers love or hate this group based on their statements relating to President Bush. I couldn't help but notice one reviewer claim that the Dixie Chicks ""never back down from controversy."" Yeah, sure!  When they apologized for the negative statements made to a audience in London, they were most certainly ""backing down from controversy."" They hadn't made those statements to their American audiences, and they did it in England because they sensed that this is what the European audience wanted to hear.  They apologized because they figured that this was what their American audience wanted to hear.  Now that George Bush is about as popular as a venereal disease, they are coming out to apologize for the apology. How courageous is that?  You can be pretty sure that if George Bush were ever to rebound in the polls (I don't think it can happen), the Dixie Chicks would apologize for apologizing for the apology.  Brave ladies they ain't!";Listen to the Music
850;15.0;3.0;72.0;The music on this compact disc is unexceptional pop, verging on bubble-gum.  As usual, the Ditzy Chicks - Oops, I mean the Dixie Chicks main appeal is their looks. Their music videos were and still are always better than their music.  They may not be very bright but they still look good!;Nothing to Get Exited About
882;16.0;5.0;69.0;"I have always been a Dixie Chick fan, so I was destined to buy this album especially with the flurry of not so nice press. Well...there isn't a song on this album that you don't want to know by heart. A fantastic mix of songs to laugh, to cry and to comtemplate life about. It is a perfect introduction after 3 years!! The Track --""Not ready to make Nice"" --- who can't relate so some aspect of their life?? Not to mention, ""I Hope"". This album needs to be heard becaue it is great music and the Chicks are heros. They make no apologizes for being who they are and that is refreshing in a world where everyone is trying to fit in. This is music, life and inspiration!!";It is about the music
808;17.0;2.0;67.0;I don't think there has ever been a compact disc more over-hyped than this one.  My wife brought this home yesterday after work and I have been subjected to all the songs at least twice since then.\n\nMy wife agrees that, except for the title track, there isn't much here worth plunking down money for.  This CD is a lemon and she want's her money back!\n\nTo the idiots who claim that only politically motivated Bush-loving fanatics could give this CD a negative review, I'll remind you that musical tastes are subjective.  There is no right or wrong about it.  And to think that the Dixie Chicks are so fantastical that only right-wing extremists could not love their music is quite silly.\n\nBased on some of the language in some of the five-star reviews, it seems pretty clear that many of those who are claiming to love this CD are being motivated by anti-Bush political animus rather than by the music.  Of course, I'm sure that many of those who are giving it high ratings really do love the music.  And that is the right reason to give it a five-star rating.;Over-hyped for the Wrong Reasons
645;18.0;2.0;66.0;"I have to admit that I was not a Dixie Chicks fan before and don't like country music.  I bought this CD because it was compared to Tom Petty and other rockers and got tons of good reviews.  But, while their new music isn't country, it isn't rock either.\n\nI don't know what to call it other than using some of the words I've seen other reviewers use, like ""commercial"" and ""overproduced.""  It is pop of the kind that appeals to females.\n\nI can't help but think of Britanny Spears when I hear this stuff!";I have no problem with their politics but the music doesn't make it
1013;19.0;5.0;66.0;"Take a close look.  As of this writing none of the one star reviews here has much of anything to say about the actual music contained on this CD.  One line reviews with no specifics are not written by those who have actually heard this.  They all are just here to bash the Dixie Chicks for having the audacity to have a different opinion on the current occupant of the Oval Office.  You can safely dismiss these ""reviews"" as merely the efforts of those with a political agenda, and those who continue to drink the Kool-Aid.\n\nAs someone who has bought this CD and given it several run throughs I can say that this is a most impressive effort from the Chicks.  The sound is different, to be sure.  While the fiddles, banjos, and mandolins are still there they have taken more of a back seat than in the past and while it might be tempting to call this a ""pop"" album be rest assured that producer Rick Rubin (Tom Petty, Beastie Boys, Johnny Cash, etc.) keeps a firm grip on the slickness factor.\n\nWhat remains from the old days are those harmonies.  On songs like ""The Long Way Around,"" ""Easy Silence,"" ""Favorite Year,"" and the no holes barred first single ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" these harmonies are as tight as ever, if not tighter and they only serve to further accentuate the highly melodic nature of these songs.  Make no mistake.  This is very much a singer's AND a musician's album.\n\nBelieve it or not, everybody has a right to his or her own opinion, and this applies to the Dixie Chicks as well.  Those who can't see past the lies and failures of the administration will continue to take out their anger at the Chicks and will miss out on some great music in the process.  Sure, they too have a right to their opinion, but until they start yelling ""shut up and sing"" at Toby Keith, Ted Nugent, and other apologists for the administration their inconstancy at which celebrities are allowed to voice political views will render these screams thoroughly hypocritical.";A Review From Someone Who Has Actually Heard This CD
1031;20.0;5.0;66.0;"FINALLY!! The return of the Dixie Chicks is affimation that Patriotism is not dead!!  These girls should be praised for exercising their right of FREE SPEECH granted by our constitution and fought for by American service men and women for over two hundred years.  It is percieved as wrong because we have collectively lost our nerve and have been lulled into complacency by a man whose main talent is wrapping himself in the flag and quoting the bible.  Those of us who threw stones need to look in the mirror and ask if we would have the courage to put ourselves out there and stand up for this country with as much courage and unwillingness to ""Back down"" as the Dixie Chicks.  The fact that they use their music to say what they mean is even better.";Patriotism put to music
1022;21.0;5.0;62.0;Before I begin, let me say--Amazon needs to check this out.  Theres alot of people reviewing this album who obviously haven't heard it and are reviewing based on their opinion of the artist and not the product.  Not suprised...\n\nAnyway, this is a worthy followup to Home and is eloquent and inspiring.  Its harmonies are lovely and the songs are beautiful.  This will be up for album of the year at the grammys, a fact that has been placed on their last two albums as well.  Really lovely stuff here, like I Hope and Taking the Long Way;REVIEW-NOT OPINION

They are undoubtedly still angry about the Dixie Chicks statements, made to a British audience years ago, that they were ""embarassed"" about President Bush.\n\nBut don't believe the people who are giving it five stars either: It is not that good! They are undoubtedly motivated by animus against the President and like what the Dixie Chicks said about him.\n\nI'm a Democrat who voted for Al Gore and John Kerry, but that doesn't mean I can't acknowledge mediocre music when I hear it.  I am a bit embarassed to admit that I bought this CD based on all the pro-Dixie Chick news stories and reviews in magazines, newspapers and on TV.\n\nThis CD is OK but nothing special.  It is highly commercial pop (nothing ""country"" about it except the accents).

738;24.0;2.0;56.0;Most reviewers seem to disagree with me, but I found this one overproduced.  The Dixie Chicks seem to have sought to change their sound, and, while they accomplished that, they went too far.  I can hear some good tunes through the messy music.  This one could have been much better.;"Overproduced - Reminds Me of Stevie Nicks ""Street Angel"""
560;25.0;2.0;55.0;"I had been eagerly anticipating this new release after watching the Chicks record and ticket sales implode, and also hearing that Rick Rubin had stepped in to steer the ship, I was ready for a recording that would live up to the wait, and I nearly got it. The record opens up with a very nice driving, melodic number in ""Taking The Long Way"" and once hearing it I was convinced that this group had put its best foot forward in this recording, ""Easy Silence"" also really caught my ear and was a thoughtful well-crafted tune, and of course ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is as strong as anything they've put out to date.  Dangerously autobiographical, its an attempt to turn around the sentiment surrounding the band with radio all but dismissing them altogether and more tickets being sold to Little League fundraisers than Dixie Chicks concerts, Natalie Maines and company are trying to do a little pushing back of their own.  The problem is, if you're going to complete that effort, you have to deliver solid material.  Three very strong tracks open this record, but then the evaporation begins, the remainder of the record is really, to be quite frank, lackluster.  This recording really shows a disjointed trio uncertain of where ""their sound"" rests and the overall direction of their songwriting. ""Lullabye"" was something I really wanted to champion as a possible single on this release but its really missing the overall texture and layering I would expect from a band this far along. ""Lubbock Or Leave It"" makes a stab at Natalie's hometown, obviously more anger and less art. ""Voice Inside My Head"" gives the impression that it might be an interesting listen but it winds up going nowhere quickly. The entire compilation seems much like that, gets your mouth watering but never really satisfies. I did however enjoy ""I Hope"" which closes the album on a very musically adept note. Thats the one saving grace on this record, noteworthy performances from Emily and Martie, and while Natalie is in good voice its hard to find that through the bitter tones. Now its altogether possible that they were making a bold statement that they were not overtly concerned with writing material that would garner radio play and support long-haul sales projections, and if that's the case, they succeeded.  The album stalls and its really a shame, for the talent that this group exudes, to still be simmering in hostility over a poorly timed political statement.  Perhaps before the recording process moves on, the Chicks should consider following suit.";Dixie Chicks fragment on latest release
450;26.0;3.0;53.0;"So far I have heard four songs from this CD. Since they are being held out as the best, given the many zealously positive reviews here at Amazon, either 1) the aural senses of a large number of Amazon reviewers are easy to please; 2) the reviewers don't really care about the music; or 3) the Dixie Chicks friends and relatives (and maybe those of the CD's producer) are the ones posting the reviews.\n\nLooking over the numerous five-star reviews, I saw one from the Red State of Virginia claiming that it was their ""patriotic duty to purchase this CD.""  Apparently they are ignorant of Ms. Maine's recent denunciation of patriotism.  As another reviewer in the Blue State of Pennsylvania noted: ""You can't be a patriot and an anti-patriot at the same time.""\n\nA reviewer in the Red of State of Georgia writes, ""Remeber the first amendment.""  Doesn't she remember how our liberal-Democrat Dixie Chick-loving friends tried to boycott her state and others because of the Confederate flag.  They claim that burning the American flag is free speech but they are against even waiving a Confederate flag. Not to mention the speech codes they have instituted at many colleges banning ""racist, sexist or homophobic speech."" Or how they shout down commencement speakers who dare say anything they disagree with.  Hey, freedom of speech only goes so far, right?\n\nThen there are several reviewers who claim that the Dixie Chicks ""never back down."" I guess they don't remember how the Dixie Chicks dithered and groveled after their Bush remarks didn't go over well with many of their fans three years ago.  Flip-flopping three years later does not change the fact that they did in fact back down.\n\nAnd with most of the media hyping their CD, it was destined for #1.  Too bad the music is just mediocre pop.";Media Hype Sells
502;27.0;1.0;53.0;As a fan of the Chicks' music, I'm disapointed to say that this is pure political agenda driven CRAP, though I think we pretty much all expected that.  This album is basically an in-your-face retaliation of their past fallout with the political crowd.  I'm all for free speech, but if your a firm believer in not mixing music and politics then this isn't for you.\n\nHey Chicks, the true fans could care less about your political beliefs, right or left.  Just stop with the politics and play MUSIC!;Yeah, I get it already

I don't like Bush and so I was swept up in the pro-Dixie Chicks hysteria that seems to gripping many people.

I noticed another reviewer used the word ""commercial"" to describe it, and I would agree with that.\n\nThis is really about marketing and capitalizing on the anti-Bush sentiment out there, which I share.

What I have always enjoyed about the Chicks is how well they understand Music.  They are real musicians and this new C.D. is another step in the progression of their style.  They grow with each disc they put out and this one comes on hard.\n\nAs many have said, you don't need to take my word for it.

1036;30.0;5.0;53.0;I pre-ordered this album on iTunes and downloaded it the morning it came out.  I have never pre-ordered a CD before and if it were not for the TIME magazine article on the Dixie Chicks and the [...] they received after they spoke out against George Bush in 2003, I would not have pre-ordered this CD.  I'm protesting I guess.  These chicks got balls and a real spine.  I respect them for not backing down from what they believe.\n\nThat said, the album itself is great.  I'm not good at giving song by song/musical reviews but it's arguably less country than their other albums.  The vocals are classic Dixie Chicks beautifully supported by strong (sometimes simple) but non-overwhelming instrumentation.  The songs are perfectly singable which makes for perfect travel CD.

I know that their politics are controversial; so here I am simply reviewing the CD and not their politics.\n\nThe CD starts off strong with ""The Long Way Around."" This song has a terrific musical arrangement including good use of the guitar and she sings of a woman who's not ready to settle down. Could she be implying that she's not ready to give up her fight for her political beliefs? Perhaps; some of the songs on this album have a quasi autobiographical feeling to them as well.\n\nFor example, The Dixie Chicks perform ""Not Ready To Make Nice."" In this song, which is very well written and performed with a great use of the guitar at the very beginning of the song, The Dixie Chicks sing of a woman who just isn't ready to forgive even though she knows forgiveness ""is good."" She's ""still mad as hell"" with someone she feels has wronged her. The women singing together share a passion in their voices that imparts a strong, powerful force to their feelings.\n\n""Lubbock Or Leave It"" is a great rock and roll flavored song that is perhaps the most autobiographical on this CD. As you know, The Dixie Chicks weren't universally welcomed after singer Natalie Maines' negative remarks about Bush in 2003. The fast pace of the song highlights the fury the woman feels. She sarcastically makes fun of ""Southern hospitality"" and asks the question ""How will I get to heaven now?"" The elements of both rock and roll mixed with country at the end of the song give this track an awesome punch to it!\n\nSome of the other songs on this album are very touching and emotional about love relationships starting or just about to break up. With the song ""Lullaby"" a woman sings of the simple pleasures of just cuddling with her new lover and wonders ""is forever enough"" of a time that they can spend together. ""Easy Silence"" opens with some awesome guitar chords and has the theme of a woman who's just so glad to be able to have a reprieve from the stresses of everyday life just by spending time with her man. There's a brief autobiographical reference to radio stations that didn't play their music as well. ""I Like It"" is about the joys of life with a new love; and ""Silent House"" deals with the theme of a love that is now gone.\n\nAmazon notes that all of the songs on this CD are co-written by The Dixie Chicks themselves. In addition, other writers on this CD include Sheryl Crow, Gary Louris, Mike Campbell, and Keb' Mo'. Look also for Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench and guitarist Mike Campbell to contribute energetic and tenacious accompaniment that increases the sense of raw passion and total honesty throughout this album. I agree when Amazon notes that the group is maturing very nicely. They are increasingly putting their own personal stamp on their work and the payoff is enormous as the songs on this album are really outstanding. The musical arrangements are all very well done and the ladies sing beautifully. Moreover, there are honest and autobiographical references throughout the CD; for example, The Dixie Chicks clearly state that they're ""not ready to make nice"" (make up) with the current Bush administration.\n\nOne thing to note, please: because I am reviewing the CD and not their politics I am simply sticking to the facts here and not taking sides. (I do, however, support the right of both sides to freedom of speech.)\n\nThe final song, ""I Hope"" is very beautiful. Employing a gospel influenced flavor of music, the song represents a type of prayer that in the future there will be no war so that ""we can all lose the pain and misery."" Amen to that!\n\nIn short, this CD packs a terrific punch and it leaves the listener wanting more. Although Amazon writes that you might need to play it more than once to appreciate its' beauty; I have a feeling that even the first time around people will love this CD. Sure, the group has their politics; but the music is what's being reviewed here--and the quality of this is excellent. Get this CD and enjoy it many times over! The Dixie Chicks have made a great contribution once again to the arts!";A golden nugget shining brightly as The Dixie Chicks passionately, furiously rock on!
395;33.0;2.0;51.0;"One reviewer claims that we should celebrate July 4th by buying this CD instead of waving the Stars and Stripes. He claims that the USA is ""the focus of evil in the World."" Given that the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines recently denounced ""patriotism"" as ""wrong,"" I guess that if you hate your country, that would be a good idea.  But the songs I've heard from this CD are just highly commercial pop-fluff with whining singing.  Plus, I love my country.  I guess I'll be a jingoistic yahoo and celebrate the 4th by buying a Toby Keith CD instead.";Don't Wave the Flag - That Would Be Dumb!
603;34.0;2.0;50.0;"I loved the Chicks first three studio albums, Home was great, and the Top of the World Tour CD is the best concert recording I own (we're talking over fifty years of ""record"" collecting here, and including Newport Jazz Festivals).  Beyond that, I'm in synch with the Chicks politics.  But my musical tastes and politics have nothing to do with each other.  My muscial tastes are eclectic, or at least that's what I like to tell myself.  But I can't handle this just-plain-boring CD.  All the songs sound pretty much the same.  There's little heart and no real fun.  It's hard to hear the music for the noise.  I guess this is what must pass for pop music these days -- it's certainly neither bluegrass nor Nashville country (hat acts and all).  I attended the Chicks' opening night in Greenville, S.C. three years ago, which was a wonderful experience.  However, for the upcoming concert I'll wait for the reports.  If it's anything like this CD, I'll be staying home.";Pop City
1032;35.0;5.0;50.0;"Amazing album, highly recommended!!! The album is completely different from ""Home,"" but that is what is so special about the Dixie Chicks--they never make the same album twice, always evolving musically. The album is only slightly political, with honest, personal lyrics backed by the Dixie Chicks' trademark wonderful musicianship. Highlights are ""Taking the Long Way,"" ""Bitter End,"" ""Silent House,"" ""Lullaby,"" ""Lubbock or Leave it,"" and ""Baby Hold On,"" though every song is great. A must-own for any Dixie Chicks fan and fans of great, honest music in general!";Welcome back Chicks!
335;36.0;1.0;49.0;From the overproduced music to Natalie Maines whiny vocals, the music on this CD doesn't make it.  I bought this CD based on all the rave reviews and feel like I was had.  Who are the people giving all the five star reviews? The Dixie Chicks friends and relatives?;Waste of Money
342;37.0;1.0;49.0;Omigod what a lot of hype. I guess there are a lot of people around who really hate Bush, huh? I'll count myself among them, but man, there's gotta be a better way to show it than listening to this CD. My friend gave this to me for a birthday present, and I was pretty excited, given all the great things I've heard. But boy, this CD really blows. I don't know what in the world all these people are talking about, but I know one thing for sure - it can't be the music! Don't blow your cash on this - get something good.;Whoa
433;38.0;1.0;49.0;I WAS GIVEN THIS FOR MY BIRTHDAY.  IT IS THE WORST BIRTHDAY GIFT AN AMERICAN CAN POSSIBLY RECEIVE.  I COULDN'T GIVE IT AWAY.;TRIED TO SELL IT AT A YARD SELL BUT COULDN'T GIVE IT AWAY!
1014;39.0;5.0;49.0;"It is nearly impossible to dissect this work from what is now Natalie Maines' most famous line, apologizing that the president of the United States comes from Texas, the same state the Chicks are from. This single line and its penultimate apology will always be stapled to any press release, any review, any tour announcements until the genealogy of this band is gone in about six hundred years.\n\nIn a world of instant media, demand for clarification and the final crucifixion of those who it is believed are un-patriotic, it would have been very easy to walk back those words. For a while, they would have received some bad press for being disingenuous, but ultimately the world would have ignored the comment. There was an apology, necessary for some amount of damage control, it doesn't take the honed skills of Jacques Clouseau to figure out that this was an insincere act, probably done because Maines felt poorly for putting her bandmates in some deep water.\n\nI find it curious then, at a time when the President's poll numbers are lower than the Intelligence Quotient of a developmentally disabled gorilla that huffs paint thinner mixed with melted down lithium ion batteries that people still have a problem with Maines choosing to speak out. When we see just how much people knew, just how much was covered up and by whom, the out and out bumbling that would actually make Clouseau look up and say ""Idiots,"" it confuses me why people still think Maines was off, and as such, have chosen to label this band on some kind of modern McCarthyian blacklist.\n\nThis is a strong album, and more than that it's not just a little bold. Anyone could have let it slide, and published a book in ten years, or gone on Barbara Walters to sob in front of the camera, describing how hard it is to be rich, famous and beautiful. Instead, they went into a studio, put it to music and stuck by principles, and more than that, they actually put out an album with more of a rock feel than a country or bluegrass sheen.\n\nThe highlights of this album for me are ""Easy Silence,"" ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" and ""Lullaby."" Political correctness for the sake of political correctness aside, there is an appeal in this album, and not just aesthetically or artistically.";Taking the high road
1019;40.0;1.0;49.0;"The first thing that hit me in this CD was, as someone else posted, that it sounded more like a Maines solo work rather than a Chicks CD. Second, the songs, while ok, just did not have the same feel of their last 2 CDs. I suppose given all that's happened that was inevitable and that is unfortunate. Stylisticly this is nothing like ""Home"" or ""Wide Open Spaces"" and if that is what you are looking for, save your money, this one's not for you. I was and I'm very disappointed. With this CD it's like they put on someone else's clothes, and they don't fit.";A let down
517;41.0;1.0;48.0;"I looked forward to the release of this CD for a long time, but now that it's here I have to say I'm disappointed.  My opinion has nothing to do with politics (which seems to be the motivation for many of the other reviews - good and bad).  I've been a fan of the Dixie Chicks in the past because their music was full of life and fun to listen to.  While musically this record is impressive, lyrically it's just self-absorbed and whiny.  It's obvious that the events of the past couple years have taken a huge toll on them, but I think they could have crafted a more meaningful response had they stuck to the humor and light-heartedness of some of their earlier releases. They have been quoted as saying this album is more ""mature."" I disagree - if anything, this is just one long (slow, BORING) temper tantrum about how the world has mistreated them, which isn't a very mature response to adversity. Nothing like playing the victim to get attention - but not a good way to get people to really listen to and appreciate your music.  Sorry Chicks - find your spark and try again.";Disappointed
870;42.0;5.0;48.0;"I understand that Reba McEntire commented negatively about the Chicks on a recent country awards show. Given that Ms. McEntire hasn't been musically interesting for many years, that's quite a compliment to the Chicks, who apparently present a significant artistic and commercial challenge to the repetitive aural stink that country music has become in the last ten years (unless one assumes that ""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk"" is high art...and, by the way, I find its sheer stupidity far more insulting than any comment ever expressed by the Chicks).\n\nThis is the only CD of contemporary music that I have purchased so far this year that hasn't been a disappointment. I am not a Chicks ""fan""...I bought ""Wide Open Spaces"" when it was first released but no other of their CDs. I purchased this one on the strength of the ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" video, the clip of ""Taking the Long Way"" shown on Amazon, and a short review of the CD in Newsweek which compared it favorably to my favorite band Fleetwood Mac. That proved to be an excellent comparison, because the very things I love about the Mac at its best are also prevalent in this CD.\n\nIf country radio doesn't play it -- well, really, who the heck cares.";Finally, great music with a point of view.
934;43.0;5.0;48.0;"""Taking the Long Way"" is a very good release from the Dixie Chicks and is quickly becoming one of my favorite CDs altogether. For fans of the Chicks, there is plenty to like here. They are in wonderful form and the music, which is very personal, is more mature yet still contains all the elements that made us like them to begin with. This isn't a clone of ""Home,"" but that was not the intent. The sound is purposely a little less country than previous efforts, and there are the welcome additions of Mike Campbell's guitar work and Rick Rubin as producer. Although ""Home"" was excellent, the reason I prefer this CD to that one is that intensely personal sentiments are being expressed here. Some recurring themes are: lost loves; past relationships; moving on; bitterness; anger; compunction (and lack thereof), anguish and fallout from ""The Incident.""\n\nEven though the entire release is solid, highlights for me include:\n\n1. The Long Way Around - This is ""My Way,"" Dixie Chicks style: toe-tapping, harmonious, up-tempo and fairly rocking. They have played by their own rules and are content with that. A good way to start the CD.\n\n2. Easy Silence - Rhythmic, Enya-like background vocals, even a triangle! A heart-felt thank you song for a protector: but whom?\n\n3. Not Ready to Make Nice - First single. Neil Young-like opening guitar; No regrets, deal with the hatred they received after the Incident. I love it!\n\n6. Lullaby - wow! This song is exquisite, lilting and quixotic. It is an outstanding song and is my favorite here.\n\n7. Lubbock or Leave It - A rocker, though still has harmonies and is funny (the line, ""couldn't keep me on my knees"" and the wonderfully sarcastic refrain, ""how will I ever get to heaven now?"")\n\n9. Favorite Year - strumming guitar; Beatles-like; woman wanting to hear how much she meant to past lover; this song is for anyone who wants to rekindle past love\n\n11. I Like It - a little funky, rocking, ""bop;"" fine, staccato and melodic electric guitar work; definitely a sing along; the line, ""gonna get so high you won't be able to bring me down"" refers to what? Drugs? Alcohol? High on life?\n\n14. I Hope - Offering of hope and peace for the near future; preaching to the holier-than-thou and self-righteous with the message: stop the hate and advocating killing; love one another, etc.; it sounds like a church sermon, with organ softly playing and back-up singers the choir, but in a way that fits the Chicks' style. Would be right at home on Motown Records. Great!\n\nThe way these songs alternate between directly addressing ""you"" the lover and ""you"" the fan makes it seem as though the two are being conflated, and that she is longing to re-establish a relationship. Although I'm not certain this was intentional, this is a contradictory message because they have repeatedly said they have no desire to mend relationships with those who turned on them after The Incident.\n\nThough I am not a big fan of country music in general, I have been listening to the Chicks since ""Fly"" because I really like their attitudes, harmonies and sound in general. They simply make very good music and I appreciate that. Being a progressive, I was naturally drawn to them even more by The Incident. Politics aside, I would think anyone who appreciates good music would find this an easily accessible CD. However, this was not made for those who are incapable of separating the Chicks' music from their political views, and it is therefore doubtful Larry the Cable Guy is going to go running back to the Chicks any time soon; then again, who wants to associate with someone like him?\n\nDetractors will likely point to songs that sound like whining and include complaints of poor treatment (""Everybody Knows"" and ""So Hard""); however, I see it as one big ""F.U."" to those who turned on them after The Incident. If the Charlie Daniels crowd doesn't like it, too damn bad. The easy thing for the Chicks to do after The Incident would have been to split up and fade into obscurity. I, for one, am very glad they did not because they are extremely talented and I look forward to hearing more of their music. Now, where is the collaboration with James Taylor?";Like fine wine... better and better
459;44.0;3.0;47.0;"First off, I have no axe to grind about the Dixie Chick's politics.  It's their right to say whatever they want to say politically just like it's Toby Keith's right.\n\nThat said, I can't say that I like this album that much.  It's just too earnest.  The playfulness of their earlier albums is missing.  This is the kind of album and music that I would listen to - just like I go to the occasional chick flick - just to earn some points with my wife by being a good sport.  If my wife wanted to go see them live, I would hope that they would still pull a Goodbye Earl out of their hats.\n\nI'm hoping that some picking and grinning makes a little bit of a comeback with the next CD.  The Dixie Chicks need to find their joy again.  This CD is an album you can respect; but it isn't the most enjoyable listen for a man.";The musical equivalent of a chick flick
592;45.0;3.0;47.0;"I just read a five-star review by woman who accuses negative reviewers of this CD as being guilty of ""hate.""  Yet, when I read her review, I don't get the feeling that she's just luke-warm about Bush. There is certainly a lot of vitriolic hate in many of the pro-Dixie Chicks reviews, as there is in some of the few negative reviews I have read.\n\nI think politics is coloring a lot of the reviews unfortunately.  I bought this CD based on the more numerous positive reviews and I will say that I am disappointed. Given all the hype, the album as a whole was quite a let down.";It is hard to decide who hates more...
1015;46.0;5.0;47.0;"I think all of the hype surrounding this CD got to me, and when I listened to it, at FIRST I was very dissapointed.  Because look at the high hopes you get when viewing the Dixie Chicks.  First we get the amazing flawless single ""Not Ready To Make Nice"".  Which was an instant likeable song.  Catchy, powerful, dark, depressing...all of the key ingredients packed into one 4 minute song.  Then there was the ever so eye catching album cover.  And we all know 50% of the reason for buying a cd is the album cover.  It's all the ways of marketing.  And this cover aims to please.  A beautiful black and white photo with the chicks getting out of a vintage cab.  This definitly has a 1940's feel.\n\nNow for the music.  Like I said in the title of the review, it takes quite a few listens to get used to.  Luckily on first listen, there are a few INSANT likeable tracks that will make you want to give the cd a second chance.\n\nTrack #1, ""The Long Way Around"" is the perfect track to open the cd with.  A nice sing along guitar driven mid-tempo track, describing how the chicks friends and family have seem to find a good life and they found it quite fast, while the chicks explain how they're taking the long way to finding happiness.\n\nTrack #2, ""Easy Silence""  the first instant likeable track.  An average ballad in the works.  But what makes the song touching is during the middle of the song when all the instruments stop and it's just a few keys touched on the piano being played hauntingly while Natalie's voice captures you and blends beautifuly with those few piano key strokes.\n\nTrack #6, ""Lullaby"" the accoustic song of the album.  For the first two minutes the only instrument played is a breezy guitar playing the same hook over and over again.  Natalie's voice is so simple and unique in this song.  Then when her voice is combined with the other 2 ladies and you get that harmonious feel...you realize there is something quite special here.  A beautiful and gentle song that is truly a soothing lullaby.\n\nTrack #7, ""Lubbock Or Leave It"" is very out of place on the album.  Don't get me wrong, the song is amazing (after getting used to it for a few times).  But this is the only UPBEAT song.  And boy is it ever.  The intro alone just makes you want to lose control and start dancing.  And while it is a great song, it doesn't fit in with the rest of the other ballad and mid-tempo songs.\n\nTracks 9 and 10, ""Favorite Year"" and ""Voices In My Head"".  Now this is where the album grabs your attention.  But don't overlook these songs when I did.  When I first listened to them, all I thought was ""No strong melody or catchy chorus"".  But that's not what every song has to have to make it a good song.  The touching and personal lyrics in this song will really make you think.  Especialy ""Voices In My Head"".  The rhythm of the song is very messy, and just has different things happening to it within 5 minutes.  But the song tells a very touching story.  A story about a man Natalie met 10 years ago in the summer, and how she'll never forget how he touched her life.  But now she is married to someone else and has a child.  And although she seems happy, she can't help but wonder what her life would be like if she decided to be with the other guy instead.\n\nTrack #12 ""Baby Hold On"" a very emotional song about making an effort to stay with the person you love when things get rough.  Martie and Emily just keep repeating ""Baby Hold ooooooooooooooooooooooooon"" in the chorus and sound flawless and harmonious when they do, while Natalie does what she does best and belts out very strong and passionate lyrics.  When they combine together that way it just turns into a powerful track.  One I guarentee you will have stuck in your head.\n\nA fan of good music will end up liking this album at the least.  Thankfully there are a few instant likeable tracks (The Long Way Around, Easy Silence, Everybody Knows, Lullaby, and Baby Hold On) that will keep you interested and will hopefully ease you into loving the album the way that I have.  Bravo Dixie chicks.  You have been through the worst, and came out with the best.  I admire you!";It takes a few listens.  After that....get ready to be blown away!
625;47.0;5.0;46.0;"Okay, first let's leave the politics aside and just talk music.\n\nIf you were drawn to the Dixie Chicks because of some of their bluegrass-tinged or traditional country songs from ""Wide Open Spaces"" or ""Home,"" and those particular genres and the DC's excellence within them were the only things that kept you interested in their music, this may not be the CD for you.\n\nThese Dixie Chicks have all grown up. (Perhaps we should call them ""Dixie Hens""?).  They've never been purely country (although more country than Shania Twain and Faith Hill), and some of the earlier songs, such as their take on ""Landslide,"" should have put diehard country fans on notice that the Dixie Chicks can and will do rock, country-rock, rockabilly, and country pop, and will do it with the same polished harmonies, melodies, and lyrics as they do with anything they touch. You simply cannot deny their talent. If you were drawn to the Dixie Chicks because of their harmonies, their musicianship, their lyrics, and their melodies, no matter what kind of song they sang, than this is undeniably their best work and you won't be disappointed. There are a lot of musical cooks in the kitchen on this one in terms of co-writers (Sheryl Crow, Linda Perry, and Keb 'Mo for example), and the result is a nice mix that takes from '70's rock, Bonnie Raitt, and even a little bit of the Al Greene Memphis sound in ""I Hope.""\n\nSo, your take on this CD will depend on what your expectations were.\n\nI recently read advice from a master gardener in my local newspaper to the effect of, ""If you're not killing plants, you're not growing as a gardener.""  Similarly, if you're not losing fans, you're probably not growing as an artist and a musician.  Sure, the Dixie Chicks will lose some diehard country fans with this CD, but they will gain a whole lot of fans who might have dismissed them out of hand as being limited to just country music.  Which leads to my next point:  The politics.\n\nIf you bought or didn't buy this CD because of the Dixie Chicks' politics, IMHO, you're missing the point.  I've never heard a Dixie Chicks song that advocated a particular political point of view; I've always liked their music because their lyrics tell a good story, they harmonize more like a sister singing group than a manufactured group (Yes, I know that Emily and Martie are sisters, but adding a non-relative can sometimes ruin the harmony), and Natalie Maines' distinctive voice beautifully stands out but stays in perferct harmony with the sisters such that I can distinguish her voice a mile out (think Stevie Nicks without the nasal inflection and drug habit and with a slight twang).  There aren't many country artists whose politics I agree with, but that doesn't stop me from listening if the music is good.  I only stop listening if the message IN the music is one I disagree with or is degrading to me, which is why I can't listen to a lot of hip-hop these days.\n\nSometimes, the music is just about the music.  And this music is good.";These Dixie Chicks Have All Grown Up

1037;49.0;4.0;46.0;"After Natalie Maines controversial comments concerning the president, one wondered after scrutiny by the American public among others if the Dixie Chicks could make a successful comeback. If the quality of this first studio album in four years is any indication, then the answer is an emphatic yes.\n\nThis album showcases the Dixie Chicks at their very best with their angelic vocal harmonies, brilliant falsetto by Maines, and sassy attitudes.  With an album of this quality and this stature, it is easy to overlook the comments made by Maines and just ""feel"" the music that comes from this very talented trio.  As always, the vocal harmonies are just brilliant. The production on this overall CD is brilliant as well with touches of acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, piano, among other instruments really making this CD so great.\n\nThis album is also one of the few albums I have listened to and reviewed this year that really has no filler material whatsoever.  This album is incredibly consistent throughout, even if some selections do stand out more than others.  There are few albums that I own now or have listened to that I could listen to all the way through and enjoy all the way through.  TAKING THE LONG WAY is one of those type albums.\n\nThe standout tracks are ""The Long Way Around"", excellent, unapolegetic first single ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", a direct stab back after Maines infamous comments, ""Everybody Knows"", ""Lubbock Or Leave It"", ""Baby Hold On"", and ""I Hope"", a fine closer to the CD among other very good tracks.  While aggressively attack their comments may or may not be the best way of dealing with their ""outs"" with some fans following the infamous comments, this album is definitely an album that true fans will and should by.  Looking from a musical stand point, this is clearly one of the best country albums of the year.  4 stars.";Superb

1025;53.0;5.0;44.0;I fell in love with the Dixie Chicks shortly before they released Home in 2002 and I've been in love with them ever since. Their musical talent is outstanding and their songs always make me feel better about myself.  This album made my day. It is a wonderful piece of music.\n\nI appreciate that they used their Freedom of Speech (nowhere in the Constitution does it say that freedom ends at our borders - isn't that one reason the government says we are fighting in Iraq? To give Iraqis that same freedom?).  In fact, I appreciate that they haven't let the crazy, hateful, hypocrites that boycotted their music, demonstrated in front of their concerts, and sent them death threats keep them from expressing their point of view.  They embody what is best about being an American - that as Americans we can express our opinions no matter how unpopular they may be.  In fact, its imperative to our Democracy that all of us do that.\n\nSing on Chicks!;A great piece of music!

3;56.0;5.0;43.0;I couldn't wait until morning to hear this album, so I downloaded it on itunes and am crying at the beauty of just the first three songs.  Every one of the chicks' albums is so unique and special, marking another chapter of their talented, strong and vibrant lives.  The crystaline voice that God has gifted unto them is not wasted and on this new album it is almost at its most distinct and powerful.  Their words are so poignant and on fire because they've been turned on by the challenge the world has given them.  In spite of their amassed fan base and wealth, they were dejected for simply giving forth an opinion.  In the greatest nation in the world, what is more sacred then the beliefs and views we are all free to have?  In this well-crafted new disc Natalie really shines and tells us that she's not ready to back away from who she is, and I for one am so appreciative of the musical results of the Chicks just being themselves.;I have tears and I'm only on track three
298;57.0;1.0;42.0;"I was interested to read the review below claiming that no one except a redneck, pot-bellied Bush supporter who has never heard the CD could write a negative review about it. I'm a female Korean immigrant who I don't think qualifies as a ""redneck.""  I've lived in the US for almost twenty years but am not a citizen so I can't vote. My view of Bush is mixed. I'm 5'6"", 125 lbs, and do not have a pot belly. (I find it odd that someone would make fun of the appearance of a Bush supporter since my experience in the US has been, with regards to White people at least, that the few non-Jewish, heterosexual males outside of Hollywood who support the Democrats are usually unathletic, weird and ugly looking, like that ugliest of Americans, Michael Moore - who has a pretty large pot belly by the way.)\n\nI did listen to the CD. I listened to it several times.  I bought it so I was certainly going to try to get my money's worth!  The problem is that the music really sucks. It sucks the first time that you listen to it and when you try again, it still sucks.  As far as the singing, the reviewers who call it ""whining"" are telling the truth.";Taking the Wrong Way
341;58.0;1.0;42.0;I really, really, wanted to like this. I LOVE the Chicks, always have, and totally supported them through the whole political thing. But I have to agree with the reviewers who have said that when all is said and done, the songs aren't very good. Nothing catchy or moving on here, like there usually is. Maybe it's because they used a bunch of other songwriters, or something - I don't know. I'm very disappointed.;Not so much...
851;59.0;5.0;42.0;"I have been a huge fan of the dixie chicks ever since I saw them perform a free lunchtime concert at the World Trade Center in 1998 (right before they hit it big). This album is a musical breakthrough for the chicks that shows exceptional artistic growth.\n\nThe first released single ""Not ready to make nice"" is already a hit of course, but the title track and at least half of the album are also potential hit singles.\n\nEach song reflects the hard won lessons of mature women who have lived and learned alot. They are now mothers raising children and have something real to say, and this album reflects that.\n\nThis is their version of the Beatles' ""Revolver"" - a bold leap into musical maturity in which there is no turning back - and shouldn't be.\n\nThis talented trio will still be around when Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, and their ilk are long forgotten.\n\nWelcome to the blue states, Ladies...and please stay....";"The Dixie Chicks' ""Revolver"""
951;60.0;5.0;42.0;"First off, I am really enjoying all the one-star reviews here that are one sentence long -- or sometimes just one word. Very intelligent! Clearly, these reviews are submitted by people who have a blind obedience to our child-killing, money-grubbing president and/or Tobey Keith. I find it intriguing that those ""reviewers"" take the time to come here and spew their bile (even though they obviously have not actually listened to this amazing album) rather than doing something more constructive with their time, such as reading exactly what is going on in the world and how our government is killing innocent people in the name of money and God. Ass-kissing idiots. It's amazing how the same Americans who spout on and on about how America is the land of the free, will -- in the same breath -- harshly judge a fellow American who speaks his or her mind in a way that they find offensive. No wonder George W. won the election. Many Americans have lost sight of what freedom truly is. Hey, rednecks, how about a little tolerance for people not like you?\n\nWith that said, here is my take on the new Dixie Chicks CD ...\n\nHonestly, I have never listened to a Dixie Chicks album before. I became interested in the band after Natalie Maines made her famous, blown-out-of-proportion-by-the-public statement against the president. I admire people who speaks their minds intelligently (even if I do not agree with them), and Maines does just that. Anyway, that's why I ran to the store to grab this CD on the day of its release. I was doing it to support the band, to let them know that there are people out here who believe in true freedom of expression. I did not expect to be blown away by this CD, but I am.\n\nMuch of the album features lyrics that provide a poignant kiss-off to country radio while embracing the future, such as on the rockers ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" and ""The Long way Around"". There is no fear in these songs, which is probably why much of the Bible Belt won't buy (or even listen to) the album. (Heaven forbid these people open themselves up to new ideas.) The Dixie Chicks' music is well-thought-out and melodious, and the flow of the songs on the CD is great -- the only problem I have is that ""Lullaby"" should be at the very end of the CD; it disrupts the flow of the CD a little, in my opinion.\n\nThis CD is pretty much country-rock, kind of in the Sheryl Crow/Lucinda Williams/Tift Merritt arena of music. Not quite country, not quite rock. This sound suits the band perfectly.\n\nI was never a fan of this band before (although I love ""Goodbye, Earl"" and their version of Stevie Nicks' ""Landslide""), but I am now. Here's to the future, Dixie Chicks! I am a new fan, and I am along for the ride -- even if we take the long way around, together.";Intelligent and catchy music! I am a new fan!
1;61.0;5.0;42.0;Two tracks into this wonderful CD, and you will have very little recollection of the event left in your mind. What happened three years ago will be a distant memory, as this album will leave you practically speechless.\n\nWhilst their previous album 'Home' was a musical step forward for the group, this album finds them reaching levels no one thought possible. Whether it be their new edgier and gritter sound, or their new found lyrical honesty, the Chicks make a statement with each and every song. They are not interested in 'making nice', but they are ceretainly interested in growing as artists.\n\nIf you still have hang-ups over what happened three years ago, then you were really not a fan to begin with. The girls recently said that they want a fan-base which is open-minded, and willing to grow and mature with them. With an album this spectacular, they may certainly get that. Out with the old, in with the new I say!;A stunning effort , both beautiful and honest
1039;62.0;5.0;42.0;This album is a modern masterpiece, and the Dixie Chicks are proving themselves to be the Beatles of our time!! It is refreshing to still have music which has such honesty and integrity. This album is a labor of love for the girls, and the sweat and tears can certainly be heard throughout the album.;Natalie Maines is the new John Lennon
1043;63.0;5.0;42.0;"Five Stars? No, it deserves Six! This is the Dixie Chick's best CD to date with the legendary producer Rick Rubin (who also won a Grammy in 2007) pointing the way and it's SMOKING ! And it made a clean sweep with 5 Grammy awards in 2007, including Song, Country Album, Country Performance by a group, Record, and Album of the Year. Whew, the Dixie Chicks are the Real Deal. If country music sometimes taps deep, troubled emotions, then the 'Chicks' are in the deepest element on this CD. There was a time I tried very hard to write them off as a fad, but the music and the voices kept bringing me back to reality: These Women Can Sing, They Are One Heck Of A Group, And They Are Here To Stay! Natalie Maines may be the BEST female lead singer in the world in any musical genre. (Oh yeah, and they look really HOT in those clothes and heels!!).\n\nWe know of their recent troubles coming off of brutally honest political statements, with radio stations instigating bans and others burning their CDs in public. Hey, this is America, the land of free speech: don't let politics block you from hearing this incredible music.  Let the lyrics speak for themselves! And God bless us one and all!!!\n\n Let's get to the music: and it is sensational. Long intricate pieces, each at least 3:54 minutes long. The 'Pieces De Resistance', the best of the best, are a sizzling ""I Like It"" with a hot backbeat, the sassy individualism of ""(Taking) The Long Way Around"" with it's burning fiddle interlude; the stark poignant beauty of ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" with it's dramatically-extended quicktime bridge, and ""Easy Silence"" will dazzle you with it's rapid-fire lyrics. The haunting lyrics of ""Everybody Knows"":\n\n ""Every time I turn around I run into my-self""; ""Everybody knows I'm just barely getting by, every-body knows.""\n\n""Voice Inside My Head"" with it's oddly familiar guitar intro is made for radio playing and CD repeat playing. The double-edged lyrics could be about their recent political troubles or a man left behind ""ten summers ago"". MORE great lyrics with a killer delivery on the bridge:\n\n""I want, I need, somehow to believe, in the choice I've made. Am I better off this way?""\n\nThe Gospel-tinged ""I Hope"" is incredible and a must-hear performance. But will the Dixie Chicks find a radio station with the guts to play it? Maybe so, but for those that don't, it will be their audience's loss. This is powerful music that should not be missed. My Highest Recommendation! Five MAGNIFICENT Stars!\n\n(This review is based on a 14 track ITunes Music Store download, plus a digital booklet and a 4:34 minute video interview.)";WOW!! A SIZZLING, MONSTER PERFORMANCE: FIVE GRAMMY-WINNER !
1044;64.0;5.0;42.0;This is an excellent CD from the Dixie Chicks.  I think so many people will relate to the subject matter on this album.  Their fan base will definitely increase with this album. My favorite is the title track.  It is a great song about following your own path in life.  This song is also about doing what you feel is best for you.  The girls sound great together here.  I Like It is a simple song about enjoying life to the fullest.  I Hope is a standout track featuring  on the guitar on this track.  He gives this track a cool smooth tone with his expert guitar playing. Lubbock or Leave it is a very upbeat song.  I loved all the instruments featured on this track especially the banjo and violin.  Lullaby and Easy Silence are two beautiful songs about the love a parent feels for their child.  The Bitter End is a pretty song about lifelong friendship.  Not Ready to Make Nice is a song about someone who is mad about getting hurt in a relationship.  I love the feisty spirit of this track very much.  Silent House is a beautiful but sad song about remembering the happiness a person brought to your life after they have died.  Taking The Long Way is one of the best country albums of 2006.  I loved all these songs.;This is an excellent CD.
701;65.0;5.0;41.0;They tried to silence them.  They tried to intimidate them.  They tried to ostracize them for daring to have a differing opinion.  They tried to ruin their careers for not walking with the goose steppers.  They tried to punish them for refusing to drink the Kool-Aid.\n\nGuess what?  It didn't work.\n\nNot only have this album been #1 at Amazon for well over a week, it is now officially the #1 album in America with first week sales of over half a million copies -- 526,000.  All of this without the benefit of corporate radio airplay who refuses to play them for daring to disagree with their agenda.\n\nThis is a triumph for freedom loving, patriotic Americans everywhere.\n\nGod bless the Dixie Chicks!\n\nOh, and the music is great too.  Real musicians and great harmonies.  The suits at corporate radio won't get it, but since they've been addicted to junk like Shania Twain and the Rascal Flatts this isn't a huge surprise.  People obviously want to hear the Dixie Chicks and by refusing to play them corporate radio like Clear Channel and Cumulus are just showing that what the listeners want is pretty irrelevant.  Their agenda comes first.  Well, we have the power and 526,000 copies sold in one week proves it.;526,000!
878;66.0;2.0;41.0;"I thought the ""Open Spaces"" album was pretty good though it didn't blow me away and who couldn't love the hit. The best thing I can say about this album, however, is that it's probably okay background music when you wash the dishes and take a phone call at the same time. To reiterate a few points already made: 1)no hits here, not even close; 2)Emily and Marti seem to be just a suggestion here and only Natalie seems to be featured; 3)songs are very mediocre (how come they can't buy some good ones from the scores of top shelf country songwriters?); 4)Natalie's anger seems to become tiresome after a while. It is probably that if this were a hit-filled album more erstwile fans would forgive them! By the way, let us take note: though she is rich and we shouldn't give her sympathy, we should observe that even a multi-millionaire (Natalie)can feel so miserable and stressed out that she eats half of Lubbock. Simply as a human being I hope you feel better, Natalie. Peace.";It'll eventually be a throwaway gift to your young nephew
0;67.0;5.0;41.0;The Dixie Chicks have finally made an album which will forever be at the centre of their catalogue. Maybe it took the 'incident' to get them this fired up, but god am i thankful it happened. This album is a masterpiece from start to finish, and the girls have certainly found solid ground with this album. No more mindless lyrics, with over-the-top arrangements. This album is honest, captivating and above all, sexy. For evidence of the latter, just listen to the seductive 'lullaby'.\n\nThis is the album of the year!!;With a new sound, comes a  new  found energy
1010;68.0;5.0;41.0;"I listened to the free copy on AOL last night. I thought it was a bit more mellow than the last few CD's and definately leaning more toward Country-Pop than Country (But isn't most hit country music these days?).\n\nJust because the Chicks are not big Bush fans - so what? It has nothing to do with ""Patriotism"". Good music is good music. Even if you are a Bush fan, you can enjoy it. I listen to Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen etc...and do not agree with everything that comes out of their mouth.\n\nCountry radio has shrunk into a real small format of 20 hit songs on a chart picked by uptight corporate guys of artists that fit the mold. Country music is geared towards 20 to 30 year old women. That's a fact. Also, I guess if I few angry people call the station, they better not play it. This CD will sell in the millions and the Chicks do not need Country radio anyway.\n\nDidn't Bush's current press secretary Tony Snow once call him `An Embarrassment', (he did)? I guess all is forgiven there now that he works for W.\n\nBuy this CD for the great music and let's not worry about the politics.";Best of 2006 - So far
1011;69.0;5.0;41.0;I love the Dixie Chicks and they have never disappointed - (especially in standing up to the Bush/Cheney Crime Family).\n\nI've heard several songs so far and WOW!\n\nBe a patriotic American and buy this album.\n\nGoodbye Earl and George.;Buying it now.
1012;70.0;5.0;41.0;I just picked this up today and listened to the whole thing. I LOVE it, I have their last 3 cds, Wide Open Spaces, Fly and Home and i love them all but i Really Really Really LOVE this one.;AWESOME
1020;71.0;5.0;41.0;This album is beautiful. If I recall Amazon is a place to review products not a place to voice close-minded political viewpoints.;Wonderful!!!
1021;72.0;5.0;41.0;The Dixie Chicks are great artists and this CD is a must have for any collection.  Top notch.;Great CD
1023;73.0;4.0;41.0;"On ""Taking the Long Way,"" the Chicks show some musical courage in tackling a lot of styles as well as topics.  They haven't completely abandoned their country roots, but like ""Home,"" they've taken another big step into other formats -- even exploring Beatlesque harmonies on ""I Like it,"" and I do...I like it.  Although I appreciate the feeling behind ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" I find the autobiographical nature of the middle bridge distracting.  At its core, it's a killer song for anyone struggling to recover from an abusive relationship (which, in a way, they are), but the pull to make it so personal in the middle actually takes away some of the punch for me.  I listen and I want to say, ""Hey Chicks, trust your fans.  We get it!""  Express your anger, yes, but don't try to reason with someone who won't buy your music because they think you're fat, or hates your music without having heard it.  Lemmings will be lemmings.  In bringing them back to the dabete, you only (in their small minds) give the them credibility they doesn't deserve.  ""I Hope"" is a better message to the critics, and could be #1 in any number of formats.  It may take more listens to see if this deserves the 5th star, but it's certainly a strong effort, even if it's missing the fun of a ""Goodbye Earl"" (which I never really liked) or ""Sin Wagon"" (which I loved.)  After ""Home,""  this CD feels like the middle part of a trilogy.  It's good, yes, sometimes very good, but it still feels a bit transitional.  I can't help but feel the next CD could be their real classic.";Brave recording
1024;74.0;5.0;41.0;The Dixie Chicks are the boldest voices in country music, and this is the fantastic album we all knew was coming.  The lyrics are sharp, intelligent, and unapologetic.

1027;75.0;5.0;41.0;Great music!!  The true Dixie Chicks fans will love this CD.;True Chicks- AWESOME!
1029;76.0;5.0;41.0;It's amazing that something so beautiful has risen from such adversity and ignorance.  Regardless of album or ticket sales, radio play, etc. this is by far their best album yet.  Regardless of your political opinions - do yourself a favor and open your mind and ears.  Lullaby is a wonderful tune for any Mother.  I went to bed singing it to my 11 month old as well as my unborn child.  Truly amazing.  Thank you hypotcrites...you helped The Chicks produce a striking sound.;Better than Ever!

1042;79.0;5.0;41.0;This album is perfect in every respect of the word. The vocals, the band and the production is delicate and outstanding. Perhaps the greatest achievment of this album is the lyrics. The girls had a hand in writing all of the tracks on the album, and boy does it show. The songs are raw, honest and emotionally gripping. 'Silent House' is worth the purchase of this album alone.\n\nDon't think or hesitate about purchasing this album. It is by far, the best album to come out in the last year or so.;Forget all the Accidents & Accusations
332;80.0;2.0;40.0;Considering all the media hype and fanatically positive reviews, the songs on this album turned out to be pretty unexceptional, even boring. It's the kind of music that will soon be forgotten - but then I don't think the Dixie Chicks are about music anymore.  Politically correct types will buy anything they put out and, judging by all the crazed five-star reviews, may even convince themselves that the music is something better than what it is.;Harmless, Overhyped Fluff
599;81.0;3.0;40.0;...I thought it sounded a little like her whiny, folky, style. I am a die-hard Chicks fan.  I own every album, including this one.  I didn't buy it to make a statement but because I love them.  However, I agree with a few other posters that the CD is a little boring.  No rocking bluegrass songs that used to make me dance 'round the house like a crazy girl.  The music is reflecting their maturity, that's for sure but come on' have a little fun, too.;Oh, so Sheryl Crow DID help with this album....
923;82.0;5.0;40.0;"Having been a fan of the 'Chicks since their debut album, I was quite upset with Ms. Maines comments on the eve of a major conflict. I was certain that I had written them off, labeled them as ""traitors"", not for the comments themselves, but for the timing and location of the comments.\n\nForward to present day.....While I still do not share their views, I DO love their music. Most of all, under tremendous pressure from country music and their fans, they never backed down from the statement that was made. In fact, ""I'm Not Ready To Make Nice"" is directly aimed at the very people that have shunned them since that fateful comment. They very well may have made their last ""major"" album because of this, and for that determination, that that passion, I applaud them. Is that not what America is about?? How can you NOT respect their choice to sacrifice commercial success for what they believe in?\n\nOn to the music itself; It is a shame the 'Chicks didn't have the influence or the backing to write ALL of the music they've done up to this point. While their previous albums have been a commercial success, this album defines them. From the beginning, with the catchy title track Taking The Long Way (which is equally as pointed as Not Ready...) to the soulful Hurricane Katrina anthem ""I Hope."" All of these songs speak about not only the last 3 years, but of the 'Chicks themselves. Add that the 3 of them co-wrote all 14 tracks, & it speaks volumes of the passion that they have for not only the music itself, but of the things they believe in.\n\nIf you were a fan of the ""Chicks in the past, you must buy this album.\n\nThe ""popular"" thing to do is to not buy this album. I almost fell into that.\n\nDon't make that mistake. These are 3 of the best singers/musicians and now songwriters in any genre of music.";The Long Way was the RIGHT way
1009;83.0;5.0;40.0;"Whether you are a country fan, a pop fan, or a mild Rock fan, this CD will not disappoint you. All of the music is from the heart, which is above any genre in the music industry.\n\nThese girls may have lost alot of fans, but in the process, they've opened themselves up to emotions that allowed them to make their best CD to date. The heartfelt emotions over what happened when the lead singer, Natalie, recieved death threats in the song ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", should be enough to sell you on how personal this CD is to the band.\n\nIf you aren't buying this CD because of your opinion on their political views, it'd be a shame, because you are missing out on one fantastic CD. Not only does their music trancend genre, but it should trancend politics too.";Trancending Genre
1017;84.0;5.0;40.0;"The entire CD is great; I just listened to the whole thing three times, which is a pretty rare thing for me to do with any music.\n\nI gave the music a chance partly because of the attacks on these ladies by the one-dimensional, right-wing sheep who threaten our country and constitution.  These Chicks rock for speaking up and for standing their ground.  I hope that thier actions inspire others to speak up and help get our country headed back in the right direction. Our children are watching us.\n\nSetting aside the polotics though, this is also just great music.  These Chicks rock in more ways than one.";These Chicks Rock

1035;86.0;4.0;40.0;"More than enough has been said about the Dixie Chicks' political views.  This is a review of the ALBUM.  If you don't like 'em, go buy a Toby Keith CD or something.\n\nThe pre-release material on TAKING THE LONG WAY suggested the Chicks are moving away from traditional country and into more pop/rock territory.  And this seems at least partially true.  The lush, provocative lead single ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is being played by VH-1 (and, sadly, almost nowhere else).  And about half the songs here would fit right in on a Top 40 station.\n\nCredit for their new sound doesn't belong soley to the Chicks, however (who, for the first time, wrote or co-wrote all the material here).  Veteran producer Rick Rubin has produced some of the most successful popular rock acts of the past 20 years.  And Heartbreaks guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboardist Benmont Tench certainly help the folk-rock vibe of the disc.  Some of the more rockin' tracks have a Sheryl Crow feel, especially ""Voice Inside My Head.""\n\nNot that the group is opposed to pulling out an old-style barn-burner, ""Lubbock Or Leave It.""  The genius of the track (like ""Not Ready To Make Nice"") is that it can be interpreted two ways: To those who care to think about such things, it's a not-too-subtle jab at President Bush.  But it can also be viewed and enjoyed as female empowerment tale, as lead singer Natalie Maines spits venom at a jilted lover.  Less volatile but equally compelling is ""So Hard,"" with lines like ""Why is fighting all that we're good at anymore?"" and the more telling ""Sometimes I don't have the energy to prove everybody wrong.""\n\nNot surprisingly, two of the disc's best tracks have nothing to do with war.  ""Silent House"" is a melodic, haunting elegy to lost loved one.  It's Maines' most compelling dramatic performance since HOME's ""Top of the World,"" to which this song could be seen as a sort of follow-up.  My favorite track, ""Favorite Year,"" address the differences between The People We Once Were (young, idealistic) vs. The People We Are Now (""Would you know me now?"" Maines ponders).\n\nThe remaining tracks vary from more standard folk-pop (""Baby Hold On"", ""Everybody Knows"") to the gospel-tinged ""I Hope.""  Even these are listenable, if unremarkable.\n\nIn fact, with its vital musicianship and mostly well-crafted lyrics, it's hard to find much fault with TAKING THE LONG WAY.  Except, perhaps, the overall sound of many of the songs does not vary greatly.  All the mid-tempo numbers sound sort of the same.  But the standout tracks easily outshine the less-inspired ones, making this one of the more enjoyable releases so far this year.";Strong material rises above the controversy (well...maybe)
303;87.0;1.0;39.0;"Have you heard of intelligent eyes?  Look carefully at the CD cover photo. Intelligent eyes they are not. The Dixie Chicks have a distinct ""the lights are on upstairs but nobody's home"" look.  They are just White trash from trailer park country and it is kind of amusing to read glowing reviews of the bimbos' album from those who fashion themselves as sophisticated and urbane. One reviewer suggests that only tobacco-chewing Toby Keith fans couldn't fall in love the music on this CD, but the man he describes sounds more like the Dixie Chicks' boyfriends/husbands.\n\nWell, I'm not a Toby Keith fan or a fan of country music. And I don't chew tobacco.  I bought this CD based on the extremely positive reviews it got and feel like a victim of a con.  I don't pay attention to professional music critics but find reviews from the general public to be more relaible.  Not this time.\n\nThis CD was presented as a new style for the Dixie Chicks, which should have been a good thing since I don't like their old style. It is not country unless Southern hick accents alone make music country.  It was presented as a rock album (which is why I bought it) but it is really an overproduced pop mess full of clashing instruments and, for the most part, screeching vocals. Listening to it, I kept thinking that Natalie Maines must have been suffering from PMS when it was recorded.  Well, what's ten bucks now-a-days anyhow?";White Trash Without Talent

It just ain't good though.\n\n""I Hope"" - Great vocal production.  One of the only two ""listenable"" songs on the album.  This track is the most ""pop"" on the album.\n\nAll in all:  This album is a flop.  I do adore the Chick's on a political level although.

Many even say that they haven't heard the CD or don't own it. One reviewer from Phoenix said, ""I hate country music and never owned a Dixie Chicks album... I listen to punk rock, rap, R&B but I just want to stick it to the rednecks..."" Why are such reviews as these allowed to stay?\n\nReviewer Green-T is correct in her observation that so many of these rave reviews are really just to spite true C&W fans. For example, here in Philly, at the time of the Natalie Maines anti-Bush tirade, college radio station WXPN started playing Dixie Chicks songs. They never played a Dixie Chicks songs before that. It is all pathetic politicking. And as for the ratings here and the Billboard Charts it is misleading.\n\nThis CD is so below the quality of the previous DC releases. Their bluegrass-friendly, easy going style has been replaced by the bitterness and resentment and moany wailing similar to the personalities of so many of their newfound ""fans."" Their is an overemphasis on Natalie to the point of it being sickening. Emily Robison and Martie Maguire are by now pretty much a backup band!";Come On Amazon!
710;90.0;1.0;39.0;"The Dixie Chicks are three incredibly talented muscians who have shown an amazing ability in the past for arrangement, performance, and writing.  Sadly, they have fallen into the trap of taking themselves too seriously.  They now believe that their lives and opinions are more interesting to their fans than their music.  Except for the title track, this album is boring.  Music should be about life, but not so introspective that the only one who appreciates what is in the music is the one performing it.  This album is for the Dixie Chicks, not for anyone else.  A true example of finding your own navel more fascinating than anything else outside of your own existence.\n\nI've been listening to music for more than 40 years and I've seen it happen many times before.  As soon as an artist says, ""This album is an exploration of new territory, more mature, expression of myself, a political statement, etc.""; you can be sure it is going to be perhaps their last gasp.  What seems to happen is that the artist loses their sense of 'joy' in the music and just become too serous. Some make it through this period, re-emerge and return to their roots; most fade away.  This is probably the Chicks last album.";Navel gazing
810;91.0;3.0;39.0;"Apparently freedom of speach doesn't include the freedom to criticize the Dixie Chicks.  Even fair-minded, three star reviews by persons who are just giving their honest opinion get obliterated with negative votes.  Some people don't want to see even the slightest critique of anything about this album.\n\nMany of the positive reviews of this CD use language that sounds more like they just love the Dixie Chicks and that anything they put out has got to be the greatest of all time.\n\nThere are a few good tracks on this CD but the rest is just ""filler.""  They have switched from country-pop to pop.  They still look good, so I would give a higher rating to their videos.";Not the best - Their videos are better
971;92.0;4.0;39.0;... but I won't. I bought the disc today and listened to it several times. The songs are well crafted.  The performances are very good. One reviewer seemed to think that Rubin's production was bombastic, but I disagree. With each listening new textures are revealed. Perhaps that negative review was by someone who expected Rubin to continue the stripped-down approach he used on many of his Johnny Cash recordings. This ain't that kind of disc.  It is full of good singin' and good playin'... and PRODUCTION, but that's not a bad thing. Why don't I give this CD a five star review? Five stars are reserved for desert island discs.  This is a very good CD, but I'm not sure it rises to the level greatness.  We'll see. As for all those reviewers who spew venom at the Chicks because of their political beliefs - GET A LIFE. You come off like toddlers having temper tantrums.  If you don't like the Dixie Chicks' politics - that's cool. This is still the land of free speech - I think.  However, when you dump all over an album you've obviously never even heard, you come off like idiots.;I should probably wait to see if this rises to a 5 star CD...
437;93.0;2.0;38.0;Earlier work by far the best.  This collection was nothing more than an outlet to vent their continued frustruations with the media backlash.  These ladies are far too talented to produce a mediocre album.  The lullabies written about their children are worth listening to.  Hopefully, they'll learn that yes, we all have a right to free speech, but it does cost (our soldiers' sacrifice and possibly their pocket books)........  maybe next time will be better;Just an outlet to vent
1002;94.0;4.0;38.0;"I'm not going to talk about the Dixie Chicks' political beliefs because too much has been of it them already and they have already adulterated critics' abilities to evaluate this album too much.  Instead, I'm going to focus on the real issue at stake: why this album is good and why music fans should buy it regardless.\n\nWhen ranking Taking the Long Away against their previous releases, it pales in comparison.  The instrumental proclivity of songs such as ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" and ""Long Time Gone"" is much absent and the variety of styles that made Fly so memorable is also greatly missed.  However, where the Chicks suffer losses, they also make great gains.  Taking the Long Way features the best songwriting of the group's career (all songs were co-written by the Chicks themselves), the greatest emotional intensity, and the most personal look at the artists themselves that they have shown over the last nearly ten years.\n\nThe lead off track, ""The Long Way Around,"" makes the album's defiant attitude clear from the start.  Lead singer Natalie Maines's powerful vocals proclaim that they couldn't ""kiss all the asses they told me to,"" and that no matter where the majority, be it fans or low aiming high school friends, demanded they go, they ""could never follow.""  It is a theme of self reliance and strength that continues with the first single, ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" a driving rock account of ""the incident"" with chilling orchestral arrangements that ironically create a tone reminiscent of ""Top of the World,"" the closing track from their last album, Home.  On ""Bitter End,"" the Chicks ""raise a glass"" to old friends who have betrayed them, while the Buddy Holly-esque ""Lubbock or Leave It"" serves as Maines's kiss-off to hypocritical small town America.\n\nThe majority of the album retains a more reflective, personal quality.  The folk styled ""Everybody Knows"" focuses on the psychological of the celebrity in American pop culture, while ""Easy Silence"" depicts the artists seeking refuge from the public nature of fame.  With ""Lullaby,"" ""Silent House,"" and ""So Hard,"" the Chicks discuss the beauty and pain of relationships and family, reflecting their own growth as mothers and wives over the course of their struggle to balance these roles with those of top selling musicians.  The album closer, ""I Hope,"" leaves the listener with this same reflective message, compelling us all to believe that love is not far away, even in the troubling times that plague us now.\n\nThose who buy Taking the Long Way expecting Wide Open Spaces or Home will ultimately be disappointed, but those who listen to it with an open mind will find it to be a thrilling and emotional musical journey.  Having recorded both traditional and mainstream country as well as a groundbreaking bluegrass album, the Dixie Chicks are no stranger to change, leading music fans into one of the most exciting new phases of what will continue to be a long and successful career.";Baby, hold on
376;95.0;3.0;36.0;"This is a very mediocre album. Nothing more, nothing less.  Looking at the five star reviews below, I couldn't help but notice that they keep using similar words and phrases. For example, Ms. Fink in Atlanta writes: ""So glad they're back."" Ms. Campbell from Florida also writes: ""So glad they're back."" And Ms. Pearson from Oklahoma writes: ""They are back."" I guess the Dixie Chicks Fan Club is sending out a script to its members.";The five star reviewers seem to be working from a script...

Unimaginative, angry, bitter and otherwise a self-important pity party of an album\n\nHow i WISH i could give it NO stars.;Blah
954;97.0;5.0;35.0;"We all witnessed the momentous rise of the Dixie Chicks. Sometimes it's a little hard to comprehend their success. With Wide Open Spaces in 1998, they went from unknowns to country music heavyweights. It all began with the Dixie Chicks' nomination at the 1999 Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and the upset win for Best Country Album over Shania Twain's immensely popular Come On Over. 7 years have gone by and every other album released by the Chicks (Fly and Home) went on to win Grammys for Best Country Album and received nods for Album Of The Year. But for a little `London Incident' blown big, this new Dixie Chicks album would have been the biggest thing in music this year.\n\nDon't get me wrong; in my opinion the release of Taking The Long Way is still one of the musical events of the year, London Incident or not. I happen not to give a toss about what has happened along the way. If the music is good, who cares about anything else? Remember the backlash when Loretta Lynn wrote and sang about ""The Pill"" at the top of her career? (Who cares? She still won a Grammy for Best Country Album 2 years ago). If you'd like to read a politically charged review, then turn elsewhere, because this one is all about the music.\n\nLet's get to the CD. I have waited restlessly for 20th May (the release date in Australia), feeding my insatiable crave only on single Not Ready To Make Nice (iTunes exclusive). First listen of the CD put a smile on my face. I grinned from ear to ear while each track played.\n\nThe general perception is that Taking The Long Way is closest to Fly. The tracks are louder, more richly orchestrated and layered with different instruments and feature prominent drumming and electric guitars. That's not necessarily a bad thing - it's a rockier side of the Chicks that we probably caught a glimpse of on Fly. You probably have read that the Chicks enlisted the aid of a couple of rock music instrumental maestros for this CD. John Mayer's electric guitar features on the 2006 Grammy Awards Best Country Song nominee ""I Hope"" (written as charity to Katrina Hurricane victims).\n\nThe CD, clocking at approximately 66 minutes, is filled with great songs from start till end. It's hard to pull out any one stand out track. However, you will find that some songs that don't seem to make an impression on the first listen will eventually become your favourites, like ""Silent House"" (the Chicks co-wrote this with Neil Finn; a moody song with an uplifting chorus) and ""Favourite Year"" (co-written with Sheryl Crow - something like you'll find on Sheryl Crow's Wildflower). Songs that get you thumping your feet, nodding your head and swinging your arms are ""I Like It"" and ""Baby Hold On"" (both are like a grittier, amped-up version of ""Cowboy Take Me Away""). The `rockiest' song would have to be ""Lubbock or Leave It"", reminiscent of ""Sin Wagon"". ""The Long Way Round"", ""Everybody Knows"" and ""Bitter End"" are easy on the ears and could easily become staple replays. ""Lullaby"" is perhaps best described as ""God Speed"" Part 2. Oh, and then there's the feisty, all-emotional but so good song called ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", which sure packs a punch to those whom this sound is directed at (you know who you are).\n\nThe Dixie Chicks deliver the songs in top form - the harmonies are deliciously rich, Natalie's voice is as powerful and expressive as ever, and Martie and Emily's trademark violin, banjo, mandolin etc. are in abundance here. Essentially, the sound is primarily acoustic with a lot of background strumming, nice organic drum beat and soaring choruses. You might like to know that while the CD is produced by renowned rock producer Rick Rubin, the Chick's sound have not been jeopardized. Ultimately, Taking The Long Way is still a country CD, full of everything that the Dixie Chicks are so well known and loved for. The only difference this time is that the Chicks co-write every song on this album, and it sure is mature songwriting.\n\nOverall, Taking The Long Way is a mighty fine CD and is a great, pleasurable listening experience. Three things I especially like are:\n1) Natalie's voice (with occasional yodelling)\n2) Emily strumming the banjo\n3) Martie playing the violin\nWhen all 3 happens, you get swept right off your feet with the awesome, satisfying, unmistakable sound of the Dixie Chicks. If you have any intentions of getting your hands (and ears) on some good music, you'd be very foolish to avoid or resist this one.\n\nLiam\n24 May 2006";A Genuine Review

935;103.0;5.0;34.0;"Okay...\n\nFirst things first. Natalie Maines' comments were Anti-Bush and Anti-War...NOT Anti-American or Anti-Troops.

And regarding her ""cowardice"" in saying her comments ""overseas""...they were in ENGLAND, and the last time I checked Great Britain was our strongest ally in the war.\n\nOn to the music...I was expecting a departure from their country/americana roots with a very ""rock"" sound, considering the new producers and studios involved...but, surprisingly and thankfully, the Chicks stick to their sound, and it's wonderful. They have created a well-crafted, contemporary-Americana album.\n\nLyrically, they address the controversies they have been involved in, their home lives, their motherhood...all eloquently and emotionally. The songs are catchy and timely and personal. I particularly loved ""The Long Way Around"" and ""Not Ready to Make Nice""...they are, in my opinion, the stand-out tracks...tackling their re-emergence head-on, no compromises. Brave, bold, and beautiful. ""Lullabye"" is another standout, just dreamy and gorgeous.

I don't have a problem with the branching out into country rock.

562;110.0;5.0;32.0;"What a great year for Rick Rubin. In the midst of Neil Diamond's masterful comeback album and the Chili Pepper's funk double-CD, he guides the Dixie Chicks to one harmonic and lovely collection of country melodies.\n\nDo you remember around 1980 when there were all these great country-pop crossovers were everywhere on the radio? This is one of those albums that has soooo many candidates for such exposure. Country fans will likely hear what they expect, but there's much for pop music fans to like as well. Smart songwriting, tight songcraft, topical and relevant lyrics, ""hummable"" melodies - like Faith Hill and Garth Brooks this is the kind of album in which pop music fans will find much to admire.\n\nThe only unfortunate piece with the red-state backlash, orchestrated mostly by the kind of jingoistic rah-rah that is the basis of Chevy truck commercials, is that at the end of the day, all this is is a great pop album by polished musicians.\n\nRegardless of their political stance, regardless of the straw chewin' DJs who won't play their music, regardless of the promoters who won't touch them with a 10-ft. pole, the Dixie Chicks have achieved nothing more complicated than a flat-out solid song cycle.

They all sound alike, there's not a hit in the bunch.  No peppy or happy songs in the bunch.  It's like the women are all depressed at the point in their lives when they made this album, and it shows in the music.

600;112.0;4.0;32.0;The reviews and the reaction to this album and the last regarding politics, freedom of speech, thought and expression are truly bizarre.

You totally loved Home, Fly or Wide Open Spaces.\n\n2. You respect well written and crafted songwriting and musicianship\n\n3. You appreciate Natalie Maines' phenomenal voice\n\n4. You enjoy artists like Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Neil Finn and other alt country artists\n\nFor me, Taking the Long Way can't be a perfect 5/5 mainly because a couple of songs (mainly Voice Inside My Head) could have been trimmed...I would say it is an album that the band had to make to answer the way things have gone for them...but it signals that the Dixie Chicks will be with us for a good while yet.\n\nI think its wise for music fans to distance themselves from the shallow partisanship and childish bullheadedness regarding whether or not you buy this album. If you're thinking you might get it...wondering if the music will withstand all the hype...yes.;What an interesting illustration of the way we are...

So be very skeptical of the 1 or 2 star ratings.  Listen to the words and the music more than once and you will discover a very personal, mature cd that far surpasses their previous work.  Sure, it addresses the death threats and the organized efforts by some groups to end their careers (how un-american is that?) in ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and how their loved ones gave them support in ""Easy Silence"" during that hurtful period.  It also goes further with Natalie Maines grandmother dealing with alzheimer's (Silent House) and both Emily Robinson's and Martie Maguire's struggle with Infertility (So Hard).  The title track deals with their beginnings as a group and my favorite song on the cd is ""Voice Inside My Head"" which I bet will be their next hit single.

491;117.0;5.0;31.0;"It was March 10, 2003; the U. S. was poised to invade Iraq and the Dixie Chicks were performing in London. Lead singer Natalie Maines' off-the-cuff onstage comment that evening was about to produce shock and awe in the world of country music.\n\n""Just so you know,"" she told the crowd of British fans, ""we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.""\n\nAlthough they had just won four Grammy awards two weeks earlier for their album Home and were the most popular act in country music, the backlash was immediate. Country radio stations stopped playing their music, protesters began appearing at their shows and burning their CDs, they received death threats. But they also expanded their audience--their 2003 tour was country music's biggest moneymaker of the year.\n\nIn the three years since ""the Incident,"" the Iraq War has become an unpopular quagmire and the president's approval ratings have plunged to record lows. After taking some time off to have babies, the three Dixie Chicks got together with superstar rock producer Rick Rubin to record their long awaited next album. Where the group was originally deemed ""too country"" for contemporary country radio, their new sound is anything but. Home was an all-acoustic, down-home bluegrass-type affair with nary a drum in sight; Taking the Long Way is being compared with Fleetwood Mac and `70s California pop-rock.\n\nPersonally, this new disc reminds me most of Mary Chapin Carpenter with its blend of country, folk and rock. The leadoff track, ""The Long Way Around,"" borrows both its title and its theme from her ""The Hard Way"" and ""The Long Way Home,"" but with more bite: ""My friends from high school/Married their high school boyfriends/Moved into houses/In the same zip codes where their parents live/But I/I could never follow.""\n\nThe track getting the most attention is the first single, ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" an autobiographical response to the controversy and its aftermath: ""And how in the world can the words that I said/Send somebody so over the edge/That they'd write me a letter/Saying I better shut up and sing/Or my life will be over."" It's a potent song that oughtta be a monster hit.\n\nThe other song that jumps out immediately is the set closer, ""I Hope,"" a gospel-tinged number co-written with bluesman Keb' Mo' that made its first appearance on the Hurricane Katrina telethon last fall. Catchy in a Staple Singers style, its lyrics serve as both a warning and an inspiration.\n\n""Lubbock or Leave It"" is a hard rockin' farewell to Maines' hometown complete with Buddy Holly imagery that should insure an unpleasant homecoming at the next class reunion, but the rest of the songs here are less specific in their references. ""Everybody Knows"" is country radio-friendly in its relatively generic arrangement; ""Easy Silence"" is a song of love (to a spouse, a parent?) about refuge in the maelstrom of life.\n\nMaines and her bandmates, sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, co-wrote all fourteen songs with collaborators including Sheryl Crow and Gary Louris of the Jayhawks, and there's a personal, intimate feel at times--in the beautiful love song, ""Lullaby,"" in the sad Alzheimer's story of ""Silent House."" The guitars of ""Voice Inside My Head"" recall George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks are bigger than country music now. They were on the cover of Time magazine's May 29th issue as ""Radical Chicks"" after appearing in the same publication three weeks earlier among the ""100 People Who Shape Our World.""

I read that the music is similar to seventies rock bands like the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac, two of my favorite bands ever.  This was going to be a tough boycott.  Then I heard the first single, Not Ready to Make Nice, on David Letterman and again on another show airing the video.  I found myself humming the tune the next day.  Darn it, darn it, darn it.  I relented and downloaded all of the songs and I love every single one of them.  Love them.  I'm not going to punish them by punishing myself by denying me the pleasure of their music.

The only track I really liked was Voice Inside My Head, where Natalie really showed how strong her voice is.  The others songs that were passable were The Long Way Around and Not Ready To Make Nice.  I found Lullaby to be 6 minutes of boring repetition. I guess I prefer a more country/bluegrass/acoustic sound, most of the songs just didn't catch my ear.  I also thought that the album photographs were really ugly.;Disappointing
188;121.0;5.0;30.0;"I'm not sure if I reviewed the original album when it first came out, but I have nothing to add except that it's brilliance never wavers, its richness only deepens, and it's easily one of THE top 5 albums of 2006.  This new reissue is better-packaged, with an essential companion DVD consisting of 3 programs: the Chicks' Sessions @ AOL performances, the eyebrow-raising vidclip of the controversial ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", and interviews with the Chicks and Rick Rubin on the making of the album, which delivers some cool insight.  This only makes ""Taking The Long Way"" more of a keeper than it already is...highly recommended.\n\nI have one suggestion though...if you bought the BestBuy version when it first came out, DON'T sell it before you buy this version, as the killer bonus track on that disc, ""Thin Line"", is not here...instead, buy this reissue, do a switcheroo, and sell the other package...that way, you have ""Thin Line"" AND this new package with the DVD.\n\nThere ya go...I have the same amount of respect for the Chicks in not backing down, keeping their defiance level high, and not caving into those Repiglican [...]...happy the doc ""Shut Up And Sing"" was made, which gives the middle finger to those Repiglican detractors and the sorry case of the President in office...looking forward to 2008 and YAY about the Dems sweeping the midterm elections, woohoo!!!  I'm sure the Chicks were celebrating the news on that.  All this activity and this album proves the Chicks were NEVER mainstream Repiglican country to begin with...they are blue-sided ALTERNATIVE country with a slice of powerpop and Cali-rock, just how I like 'em.\n\nAll hate mail...send it over, I can take it, LOL!!!";Now with a great companion DVD!!!
315;122.0;1.0;30.0;This album was a shocker!  I was really disappointed and feel that the chicks did not live up to the quality that I had come to expect from them.  It was as if they have all been off their prozac for a couple months, very depressing and angry!;Don't bother
392;123.0;1.0;30.0;The CD was completely disappointing.  The music was dark.  There's not a single cut worth replaying.  Will some cowboy please come and take them away.;Disappointing
650;124.0;5.0;30.0;"I purchased this CD to support the Dixie Chicks' right to freedom of speech, but I am thrilled to say that it's the best purchase I've ever made.  I had to force myself to listen to every song because I loved each song so much when I first heard it, that I kept playing just that song over and over.  I've finally heard them all and I can't even name a favorite (today  it's ""Everybody Knows"" but tomorrow it'll be something else!)  Thanks (Chicks) for creating a CD that brings such pleasure to my everyday life.  And thanks for not backing down and making ""nice"" -- the C&W industry wouldn't expect a MAN to do that.";Best CD I've EVER Heard
844;125.0;1.0;30.0;My wife and I heard the Dixie Chicks on Good Morning America performing two of the songs from their new album. All of the political drama aside, the songs I heard were nothing more than contemporary pop country garbage. My wife, who is more of a Chicks fan than I agreed that it did not even sound like their type of music. Their first two albums showed merit and a touch of true country style. I wouldn't be surprised to see this album hitting the bargain bin very soon.;More Contemporary Country Grabage
487;126.0;3.0;29.0;Since Maines and company are generally reviled south of the Mason-Dixon, it's ironic that Dixie is in their name.  Shouldn't they just call themselves the Chicks now?;Irony
518;127.0;5.0;29.0;"...I had heard of the Dixie Chicks here and there, and heard all about the Bush/backlash/controversy (which was completely and utterly hypocritical of this country), but I had only heard a few of their songs here and there.\n\nA friend of mine recommended this CD...and I thought to myself, I don't even like country music, why would he recommend this CD?  Well, this CD isn't exactly country, or is it exactly pop music...it's just simply a wonderful CD with different musical elements in it (an excellent combination of country music and more pop/mainstream music, along with some folk thrown in there as well).\n\nWhat I love so much about this CD is that although one can easily interpret the songs as being about love...which is a common theme in music...the songs, on a bigger level, are about these ladies taking a stance against many forces which were up against them (on a 1 to 1 level, and on a societal level) and surviving it all.  ""Everybody Knows"" is an especially beautiful song which really speaks to me.\n\nAnyhow, whatever genre of music you like...this is simply a beautiful album...definitely worth getting.";Impressive album...
532;128.0;5.0;29.0;"I'm getting sick of people hating on the Dixie Chicks b/c they basically said Bush is a moron.  Who cares?  Bush IS a moron, and they aren't the only ones to talk bad about him.  It's pretty unfair for the Chicks to receive such harsh criticism from all these hardore Bush supporting redneck idiots.  If you they want to listen to something that would really pi$$ them off, they need to listen to Immortal Technique Revolutionary Vol 2. (which is another great ablum)  And they thought the Dixie Chicks were bashing?...ha.  Plus, they might learn something.\n\nThat said, to get to the actual music on this album, it's absolutely excellent.  They aren't afraid to change up their style this time around, making it sound more of a Southern Rock cd.  The song ""Voice in my Head"" has an awesome melody with some really good thought inducing lyrics.  I'd give this album 10 stars if I could, just to make up for the ignorant people out there taking their aggression out on the Dixie Chicks by giving this album 1 star.  They're just mad b/c they voted for Bush and now feel like an idiot for doing so.  I know those same people are gonna mark ""No"" on this review being helplful, in hopes to take this review off.  If that's the case, I say ""fantastic"".  The more they press ""no"", the more people will read this review.  So, by all means........  Oh, and for those that agree with me, it's nice to know that there are actually intelligent people living in this great country of ours that just so happens to be ran by a shady cowboy who walks like he's got something stuck up his.........";Bush Haters!  I love it!!!!!!!!
647;129.0;5.0;29.0;"I bought two copies of ""Taking the Long Way"", one for my mom, and one for me.  From the moment I turned it on I knew I was listening to something incredible.  This album is like 70's California rock with a country/bluegrass twist.  Every song has something to say.  They cover everything from personal integrity, to alzhiemers, to infertility.  This CD is a must have for any music lover.  Anyone who says it's bad or mediocre cleary has no idea what they're listening to.";In a word... Wow!
690;130.0;5.0;29.0;I have to admit right of the bat that I was a big time Bush supporter and voted for him twice. At first I followed the PC media in mocking and censoring these ladies. But all the while in the back of my mind of was curious what their music was really like. After buying this album, I can tell you: from a die-hard Republican, these ladies have mega-guts. I have the utmost respect for people of honor like the Dixie Chicks who are brave enough to go against the PC tide and challenge others when they see a wrong being committed. Thanks ladies!;Awesome music ... courage to be politically incorrect!
712;131.0;1.0;29.0;The review said they matured but it seems to me they've matured from the Dixie Chicks with a wonderful bluegrass sound to Natalie Maines & the Dixie Chicks.  The sisters are fading into the background.  I bought their previous albums for the bluegrass and because I thought the sisters did such a wonderful job with their respective instruments.  It's so sad that one blurt of no real significance has changed all that.;Matured?
788;132.0;1.0;29.0;If you liked the purity of all the instruments on Home you will hate this Album.\n\nThe Chicks have gone steadily downhill since Home.\n\nOn their World Tour album they included that stupid steel guitar which completely drowned out the banjo and violin.\n\nThis in your face, I can say anything I want, and you can kiss my rear end attitude shows how little class they now have.\n\nThere isn't one good song on this album, plus I only heard the banjo once and very little violin.\n\nSave your money, and don't waste it on these fools.\n\nThey need to get back to what made them popular in the first place.;Awful, Horrible, and a piece of Trash
830;133.0;5.0;29.0;"This song hit quite a nerve with me. I grew up in the deep South, a born and bred progressive Democrat, and I can still recall a dozen bruising clashes with people on the other end of the ideological spectrum that I neither sought nor enjoyed. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is about Natalie Maines' and the rest of the Dixie Chicks' enduring defiance in the face of the harsh backhand they got (and continue to get) for voicing dissent and dissatisfaction over the President's foolhardy rush to what a great number of Americans now agree was and is an ill-conceived, unnecessary war.\n\nAs I listened to this song for the first time, I had a disorienting rush of memories fly up at me. Like my former father-in-law banging his hand on the table and -- with a vein bulging on his forehead and spittle gathering at the corners of his mouth -- screaming at me to ""name one social program that's ever worked."" This, because I had simply answered another relative who asked if I listened to Rush Limbaugh, that I was not a big fan. That and a rush of other blood-pressure-raising moments ran through my mind as I listened to this song.\n\nI wish I had the kind of courage it took to write and sing this song. I live in California now, with my second husband (who has a lovely set of parents), and our two kids. I love the tolerant atmosphere here -- even Republicans aren't ridiculed in my liberal enclave. But I miss the South. I miss the trees and the woods and swimming and fishing on the Tennessee River. I miss Southern accents and cooking. And I miss the people who are often so much more graceful and polite in everyday life than in many parts of the country. (No one has ever asked me here in Los Angeles, ""And how is your mother?"" ... even if they have met my mother several times.)\n\nBut I don't miss that heart-thumping feeling -- when talk turns political and I am the lone dissenter in a  group -- of knowing that I have to either bite my tongue, deferring demurely, or respond earnestly and probably make a roomful of enemies.\n\nI've never had my life threatened or had to live through heaped-on, possibly orchestrated, public scorn like the Dixie Chicks have. So from my perspective, it was an act of unimaginable bravery for that woman to sing this song, and for her bandmates to back her up.\n\nNatalie, it must be a bad feeling to know that some mother somewhere is teaching her daughter to hate you and what you stand for. But remember that even though much of this sentiment is directed at you, it never was about you. It was about the fact that your remarks made people uncomfortable with the giddy rush to war and the flimsy pretense under which it was done. And as it continues, it is strongly related to the cognitive dissonance a lot of people are now feeling who voted for Bush in the last election.\n\nI'm one mother who is teaching my daughter that you're a good example of a very brave woman, with some loyal friends. Who can sing her butt off.";Not Ready to Make Nice
872;134.0;5.0;29.0;I'm not a country fan (I bought the new Red Hot Chili Peppers album the day before this one) but seriously, this is good, solid music.  More consistent than the previous albums.  It seems like the chicks (can I say that?) have done two things here, stuck to their guns and backed up their guns with talent.  For my own tastes, it probably didn't hurt that they collaborated with some of my favorite Minnesota folks (from the Jayhawks and Semisonic).\n\nThere is no better way to stick it to the man (big radio) then to not back down and then succeed on your talent in spite of the forces lined up against you!\n\nGood, solid outing that will remain in play for me...right next to the Jay Farrar, Son Volt, Wilco, Jayhawks side of my CD collection!;Stick it to the man!

587;138.0;1.0;28.0;This CD typifies the reasons for illegal downloading - two good songs followed by filler.

The harshness cutting into the values that we, not only hold close to our hearts, but are selling to the world in general. We are herded into believing we are spreading democracy into the middle east, and yet we shoot down our own freedom of speech, within our own country. Ironically, those that do that have that exact freedom to do so, but, doing that, in order to cut down another's freedom, what are we really saying about our own freedoms?\n\nIf you step out of the propaganda for a moment, these girls are simply musicians making music.

511;147.0;5.0;27.0;"With this album the Dixie Chicks have made a real masterpiece. This is by far their most consistent and most personal album, which really says a lot, considering how strong their three previous albums are. Rick Rubin's production is simply perfect for their music.\n\nFor the first time they have released an album of entirely new originals. The album has been long awaited, not least due to the controversal statements of Natalie Maines, which made many fans turn their back the group. It seems all this controversy made the girls want to make the perfect album - and in my opinion they have succeeded. Each song is a gem; some are potential classics.\n\nThe album starts off extremely stongly with three outstanding tracks. ""The Long Way Around"" is simply so catchy that it must be the obvious choice for their next single.\n\nThe album contains a handful of great ballads, and ""Easy Silence"" may very be the strongest  - a very moving and personal song, which also could turn out to have hit-potentials.\n\n""Not Ready to Make Nice"", the first single, deals lyrically directly with the political controversy, and muscially it's another outstanding track.\n\n""Everybody Knows"" and ""Bitter End"" are more ""country"" and traditional Dixie Chicks - both fine tracks.\n\n""Lullaby"" is what it says - a quiet acoustic lullaby - and a beautiful one.\n\n""Lubbock or Leave it"" is an up-beat bluegrass rocker; not unlike some of the tracks from ""Home"", though heavier produced.\n\n""Silent House"" is dark ballad - lyrically dealing with getting old.\n\n""Favorite Year"" is another personal favourite; a very catchy track sounding a lot like Sheryl Crow, which is really no surprise, as Crow co-wrote the song with Martie and Natalie.\n\nThe funky and groovin' ""I Like it"" shows that the girls are not afraid to step completely away from their country-roots.\n\n""Baby Hold On"" is a fine rock-ballad - interesting sound on the lead guitar.\n\n""I Hope"" was released a Katrine charity track; another soulful recording and a worthy closing track.\n\n""Taking the Long Way"" is one of the greatest records released this year, and is very likely to be an album that 2006 will be remembered for.";One of the Greatest Albums of 2006

Appalled that America could take such a narrow-minded stance against these girls for being AMERICANS and exercising their Consititutional right to freedom of speech, I have highly anticipated the release of this album. And it was well worth the wait!! My husband and I have memorized every track on it and are excited about their upcoming concert here in the Lone Star State.\n\nThe lyrics are poignant, yet extremely powerful. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" will certainly move you, regardless of what side of the political fence you're standing on. And just like we are ready to criticize them for what they said, they have masterfully given us their response in this CD.

They've gone from writing and/or performing happy, up-tempo music with a wicked sense of humor in favor of coming off like a collection of whiny, preachy kvetches.

Much like that CD, there are going to be excellent quality songs that you will be able to latch onto. Being someone who has had long experience in country and Grammy studies, I would still call this CD a must buy, even if you eventually find yourself setting the player to skip a track or two.\n\nThe tracks I enjoyed most include ""Baby Hold On,"" ""The Long Way Around,"" ""I Like It"" and ""I Hope."" They all possess that ingredient that tells you that, if it weren't for the controversy, we'd be hearing these played every day on the way to and home from work. It's no political statement to say that the band's promotion of ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" will be seen in hindsight as a mistake, but enough said about that.\n\nAlthough the politically motivated will lust to play this CD for all to hear, after listening to the whole compilation many times, I find it does not have the consistency and staying power as some of their previous works.

Yes, we are not our own country now, but we still have the pride and the attitude that we are great people that are not controlled and raise the most opinionated yet well-mannered Lady's in the country.

Not Pop.  Sounds like the Eagles during the late 70s.  Most of the tracks get better each time I listen to them.  ""Not Ready"" gets more powerful with each listen.  ""Lullaby"" is a great laid-back tune (It was featured on the season finale of ""Medium"" last night).  ""Lubbock or Leave it"" is a Rocker.  ""Silent House"" addresses Alzheimers.

I went back and downloaded THAT song. Listening to the samples, I realized I might as well get the whole shabang. I don't think there's a song on it that I don't like! It's just a fantastic album--sweet stuff like 'Lullaby' and 'Easy Silence,'  hard-rockin' 'Lubbock Or Leave It' and still plenty of twang if you like that sort of thing. The lyrics, too, are so poetic and filled with meaning. As a woman and mother, I can relate to so much in the songs. 'Baby Hold On' is SO spot on!

Thirty seconds into the first track, the back of my neck was tingling and I actually got a bit emotional, I was so glad to hear their voices.\n\nThis album owes a lot to their talents as songwriters and performers, and it is possible to hear the influence of Neil Young, James Taylor, The Bangles and Tom Petty, to name a few.  Beyond its musical merits, however, it is the album's naked defiance of the threats and hatred The Dixie Chicks have had to endure that makes it a thrilling musical statement.\n\nIn refusing to compromise their beliefs in order to make the music industry and the morons happy, the Dixie Chicks have joined a long line of musicians, starting perhaps with Woody Guthrie, who have chosen to embrace truth and justice and to discomfit the comfortable.\n\nThinking Americans have scorned country music for generations as being dumbed-down and nauseatingly conformist.

I don't see it as a negative that their music has evolved from the time of their ""Wide Open Spaces"" album, instead it's refreshing to see a group that isn't stuck in a rut - especially a country group.  If you want to revisit their old sound, put in an earlier album (those songs still hold up just as well today).\n\n""Voice Inside My Head"" is a standout on the album, who would have thought that you would hear a sitar on a DCX album.

692;191.0;5.0;24.0;"Prologue #1:\n\nWhen I was a child my parents had the soundtrack LP of the film, ""The Hank Williams Story.""  The songs were performed by a young, pre-rebel, Hank Williams, Jr.  I loved that record and still love the music of Hank Williams.  I also remember my father's collection of Willie Nelon and Outlaw (Nelson, Jennings, et. al.) LPs.\n\nPrologue #2:\n\nI enjoy excellence in all forms of music with leanings toward rock that range from British invasion (Beatles, Who, Kinks) to hard rock (Zeppelin) to Punk/Mod (Sex Pistols, Clash, the Jam, Elvis Costello), to traditional (Buddy Holly, Elvis, CCR, Springsteen).  My tastes do not generally cross over into contemporary country (with the exception of some Garth Brooks).\n\nPrologue #3:\n\nMy family and I are vacationing in Seattle.  Resting in our hotel room I turn on the TV and come across ""Austin City Limits"" on PBS.  The band peforming is the Dixie Chicks supporting their, then, new album, ""Fly.""  I am very impressed by the songs, the muscianship, and that voice.  I remember thinking even then that they were bigger than what passed for country music at the time.\n\nPrologue #4:\n\nNow own ""Wide Open Spaces"" and ""Fly"" and buy tickes to see the Dixie Chicks in concert for the ""Fly"" tour.  At the end of the concert I turn to my wife and tell her, ""This group could be Springsteen big if they wanted to.""  I am very discriminating as a concert goer and I was mightily impressed by their connection with the audience.\n\nThis brings us to ""Taking the Long Way"" (also bought ""Home"" and saw them on that tour).  Regardless of what one thinks about the ""comment,"" this album demonstrates impressive growth on all fronts for the Dixie Chicks.  Perhaps those who have remained fans should thank the public backlash against the Chicks because it has produced one of the strongest pop albums in recent years.\n\nIf I have one criticism of their previous albums, is that the songs lacked a lived experience to impart them with deeper resonance (with the exception of the beautiful ""You Were Mine"" on ""Wide Open Spaces"").  Case in point is their cover of ""Landslide"" on the ""Home"" album.  While certainly nice, the Chicks' version lacks the emotional timbre of Steve Nicks' voice.\n\nThis problem has been resolved on the new album with the Chicks taking on the writing duties on all songs (with partners).  Each song resonates with emotion and experience but without being overwrought.  This is due to strong melodies, crisp lyrics, luminous production provided by Rick Rubin, and subject matter that taps the emotional and dynamic scale of Natalie Maines' impressive voice.  In an industry where emotion has to be telegraphed by the vocal pyrotechnics of its singers (ala Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey), Maines' voice is remarkable for its use of restraint and power at the right moments.\n\nOne can also hear an expanding array of influences on the Chicks' music: the Eagles (""Taking the Long Way""), Sheryl Crow (""Favorite Year""), George Harrison and the Bangles (""Voice Inside My Head""), and Gospel (""I Hope"").  These are but a few of the musical echoes that I hear on this album; echoes that enrich the music without it being a slavish copy of other artists.\n\nMy musical predilictions did not predispose me to consider even purchasing a Dixie Chicks album six years ago.  My baseline for country is Hank Williams and most contemporary country music has sadly strayed far from Williams in its unrelenting musical and thematic sameness.  A chance ecnounter in a Seattle hotel room introduced me to the Dixie Chicks and I have been a fan since then.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks did not leave country music, country music left them.  As far back as ""Earl"" the attuned person could see the current tensions between the Dixie Chicks and the country establishment coming.  They were furthered by ""Long Time Gone"" and cemented by the ""comment.""\n\nThe Dixie Chicks are bigger than country music and, for this, the music lover who enjoys a spectrum of musical tastes can be thankful.

But, it wasn't worth it- they are, to me, no longer ""one of us girls singing about every day life"".  It was a big sob ""oh woe is me"" album- not up to their standards.

Their 2002 album ""Home"" was one of the best country albums in years, and as you all know their cover of Stevie Nicks' (Fleetwood Mac) ""Landslide"" was one of the most played songs of the year, Stevie Nicks even received a BMI Songwriters Award in 2003 due to the intense airplay of the Dixie Chicks version of her 1975 Fleetwood Mac classic.\n\n It seemed that their song ""Top of the World"" said it best. Their album was one of the best selling of the year, their tour sold out, and then Natalie Maines makes a simple snide comment about the incompetent ""President"" of the USA, and it all goes to hell. It seems as if NOW in 2006, that 65% of Americans don't approve of President Bush, that the Dixie Chicks argument has turned to the allegation that the Dixie Chicks have ""abandoned"" country music. Natalie Maines has commented that she doesn't need country, or whatever. And in reality, why would they make nice now? Why would they suck it up just get to played on country radio? What Country Music as a whole did to them was evil, and one of the most shameful moments in music history. They have every right to tell country music to shove it if they want.  The fact is, this album is still good country.\n\n  I have only gotten to listen it once all the way through so far, and I already have some favorites. As with all Chicks albums I'm sure as I listen more and more I will have even more songs stuck in my head. So far ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" ""Lubbock or Leave it,"" ""I Hope,"" are my favorites. The fact that they were gutsy enough to release ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" as the first single, just goes to show the reality of who this band really is. I for one am glad that Dixie Chicks aren't ""ready to make nice,"" and that they are ""mad as hell..."" as the song says. Remember Alanis Morrissette and ""Jagged Little Pill"" ? Many people's best albums are made under distress and/or madness. The same holds true for the Dixie Chicks.\n\n Now don't get the wrong message. This isn't a real fiery political album. Sure they as writers are going to write about the major events in the lives since the last album. And since their last album a lot has gone on. They have been abandoned by country radio, had death threats on their family, and saw their careers flash before their lives. Obviously this will play some part of their writing. However, there are just as many songs on this album that are obviously about other aspects of their lives (love, heartache, the usual country subjects) as their are songs about ""the incident.""\n\n I definitely recommend this album, for any fan of music in general. The Dixie Chicks are by far undeniably one of the greatest and most talented bands in country music, and possibly in all genres of music. Support this album, support free speech. Support this album, and support good music.";Dixie Chicks should always take the long way home...

They stand their ground and their firm beliefs in freedom of speech with ""Taking the Long Way"". However, this album is the complete opposite of horrible, it's great! Most of the songs are mellow and nice, and a very easy listen. It's one of those albums were you can sit on your front porch on a sunny day and just be at peace.

There debut song from this cd, ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is the perfect prelude to open their album with.  I was a little sad and frustrated that none of my local radio stations had enough nerve to play it. *eye roll*  Oh well (I guess that's why I make my own ""radio"" with my pod) However, I do know that when an album rocks like this album does, the radio and general public won't be able to ignore it.

You should buy a CD from the aforementioned and drive around in your pickup honking cuz you honkeytonk.\n\nThe Chicks have been changed by the events of the last three years, so don't expect the same sound.  They have grown and matured and have a deeper sound to their music that reflects that change.  They are obviously (and rightly) done with their country ""fans"" that went beyond giving up on them to teaching their kids to hate them.  I wouldn't want to associate myself with that crowd either!!\n\nFor anyone who has ""lost"" a loved one to Alzheimers, ""Silent House"" will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.

The big mouthed Natalie said some things that ticked us off, she needs to live with her consequences.  I bet you if none of the reviews were deleted, this CD would only have one star.

626;210.0;5.0;23.0;"I find it fascinating that so many of the one star reviews here refer to the ""hatred"" that the Dixie Chicks ""generated"" with Natalie Maines comments three years ago.  Sorry, but simply expressing an opinion regarding a politician is not an example of hatred.  The only hate that occurred in that whole incident was the hate generated by people who issued death threats to the Dixie Chicks and showed up at orchestrated rallies to burn copies of their photos and destroy their CDs.  Boycott them if you want, but there is no need for the nastiness and, calling a spade a spade here, hate just because they have a differing opinion than you do.  Last I check that was the kind of freedom America was all about -- the kind of freedom the right claims to love and to be willing to defend, but only as it applies to them.\n\nAnyway, I would not call this the best music of the Dixie Chick's career, but that is all relative anyway.  Even their weakest effort is miles better than 99% of the tripe that passes itself off as country today and in that regard this is some excellent music.  The twang isn't as strong as it once was, but the harmonies are still definitely there and this is very much a Dixie Chicks album and one, that I might add, sold 536,000 copies in its opening week despite an organized effort to silence the group.";Taking the Long Way

This cd is one of, if not the best cd I have ever heard. From the 1st song to the last I was hooked. I have never lisened to a cd and have it bring me to tears. ""Silent House"" is one of the best written songs I have heard. Of course ""Not ready to make nice"" is a 10 also! Im telling everyone I know to buy this cd.

I can't stand this BS she and the band have had to endure, but in a way it seems to have made them stronger.\n\nI have never been a diehard fan of the Dixie Chicks, but in all honesty a couple of their songs from Home and Fly can literally take me to a higher plane of being. In fact, if I was sent to a desert island with only one song to hear the rest of my life, I think it might have to be  ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" --that fiddle solo the last minute and a half of the song has the most beautiful set of notes I have ever heard created in music. I never get sick of it.\n\nI read an article the other day in which the DC were asked about how they felt not being at the top of country charts and they kinda laughed and said, ""Well I don't know if there's room for us anyway in between songs like ""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk"" and ""Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall off""....They've got a point!\n\nI admire the Dixie Chicks and think they are each such special, intelligent, beautiful women....they complement eachother so well. It's awesome that they sing ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" in response to what has happened and I love that Natalie Maines stays true to herself. If it caused her the loss of ignorant fans, good riddance.\n\nI'm looking forward to this CD.

697;214.0;5.0;23.0;The Dixie Chicks are back in a big way. Musically, this is their best CD yet. Profound lyrics, rich melodies, and fantastic harmonies constitute this release.\n\nI am a huge country music fan, a Republican, and have followed the backlash from comments that Natalie Maines made a couple of years ago. However, I am one who can separate their political views from their music. While I do not agree with them politically, they make fantastic music. Besides, if you decided to boycott all celebrities who make rash statements while standing on a soapbox, you would have no entertainment left!\n\nGive this CD a chance...it's worth it!;Excellent CD
777;215.0;4.0;23.0;The first time I listened to the album, I thought 'Man Natlie is really pissed' Can't say I blame them. Speaking your mind and ,as we now know, the truth can be dangerous in this world. But a second time through I could hear that great upbeat sound that I love about the Chicks. It's just that lyrics aren't silly fluff this time around. They have grown as people and the album reflects that.\n\nMusically this album is not a good as Home, a country masterpeice IMHO. But the personal and powerful lyrics shine through. Too bad they released 'Not Ready to make nice'. It's one of the weaker tracks on the album. 'The Long Way Around' is a bouncy hit waiting to happen. 'Lullaby' (which was featured on the show Medium last week) is a simple beautiful song that makes me wish I had a child to sing it to.\n\nAnd one final message to the 'Red-State' Chick haters:\n\nCountry music is nothing more than steel guitar pop music right now. Reminds me of the  late 70's and early 80's crap brought about by the Urban Cowboy craze that was FINALLY put down when Rady Travis, George Strait and Garth Brooks brought country back from the dead. . Nothing I hear on the radio today will be consider a 'classic' ten years from now. The Chicks were one of the few country artists that made music and now they've been shown the door.  Why? Because they publicly said Bush was an embarassment. Big deal. The president is not an idol and he's not a king. If we have reached the point in this country where the president is above criticism then we have bigger problems. So turn off CNN and Fox news and listen to some REAL music.;Excellent Album
787;216.0;5.0;23.0;"Prophets are people who speak the truth to those in power.  By this definition, the Dixie Chicks are prophets.  They are also patriotic in their efforts to speak out against a rogue and dangerous administration that has shredded the Constitution in to so much confetti.  Unlike the mainstream media which acts as a cheerleader for these actions to Dixie Chicks have not stood by.\n\nBut all of that is irrelevant (except to contrast those one star reviews who have little to say about the music and lots to say about bashing the Chicks for daring to think outside the box) to the music here.  The music here is indeed a change from previous Chicks recordings.  The acoustic based country they were best known for is still there, but overall the sound has more of a country-rock flavor.  Producer Rick Rubin is best known for his work with acts ranging from the Beastie Boys and Tom Petty (as well as Johnny Cash) and he makes his stamp known, but without overshadowing the Chicks themselves.  This approach works best on songs like ""The Long Way Around,"" ""Bitter End,"" ""Voice Inside My Head,"" ""Easy Silence,"" ""Favorite Year,"" and the gospel flavored ""I Hope.""\n\nDespite all the naysayers attempts this album remains #1 here at Amazon and will make a big debut on the charts next week.

802;217.0;5.0;23.0;"I bought this album originally as a showing of support for the Dixie Chicks, and their right to free speech. I also support those who have a opposing view, but I don't support those who would threaten someones life because their opinion differs from theirs. Nor do I support a obvious attempt by FM country music stations to try and decide for those of us who happen to like the Dixie Chicks music what we should hear and what we shouldn't. All that being said though on to the CD.\n\nI truly rank this CD up there with the Fleetwood Mac Rumors CD. When Fleetwood Mac wrote the songs for the Rumors album there was a lot of pain in the members of the band from relationships that they had been in and ended. It was their best work ever.\n\nThe same kinda of emotion is evident here in this CD, with the same results as far as I'm concerned. This is the Dixie Chicks best CD so far. The melodies and harmonies are great, as always with the Dixie Chicks. The style has changed from the twangy country to a more smooth sounding country pop sound. While it is a darker album there are a couple of fun songs on it like ""I Like It"", and ""Lubbock or leave it"".\n\nI personally like the melodies and the harmonies in ""Voice inside my head"" & ""Silent House"".\n\nBottom line all politics aside this is a GREAT album that I have listened to everyday since I purchased it. The songs get in your head and you find yourself singing them to yourself.\n\nAs far as the reviewer who commented that people were looking to unload this CD because there was already 52 Cd's for sale in the used section. I guess the fact that Toby Keith's latest CD has close to 100 in the used bin as does Trace Adkins must mean that people like them even less than the Dixie Chicks using your method of thinking.";In the Mold of Fleetwood Mac Rumors

I grew up just north of Bakersfield in central California and frequently heard ""Cousin Herb Henson and the Tradin' Post Gang"" do their afternoon music fest,frequently welcoming a persistent minor singer named Buck Owens to the show.  I found it all not to my taste.  Then I heard Patsy Cline and I melted: she opened the world of C/W wide open.  Wynona singing ""Amazing Grace"" a capella with just her backup singers.  But even the Dixie Chicks were not on my radar screen until ""the event"" where Natalie Maines showed the incredible set she has by doing what NO politician in Washington would do because they were all too busy running after and trying to jump on board the war wagon.  Natalie exercised free speech.  To me it's never less than amazing from where and from what life's heroes are formed.  Your reviewer from Texas still trots out that old saw about respecting this occupant in the White House because ""we're at war.""  The country has grown tired of the war and has come to realize what a political opportunistic pinhead Bush is after Katrina.  The emperor is stark naked.  And Natalie and the Chicks are walking around covered in glory and ""I told you so's.""  Of course I bought this album and I have loved it.  I shall be buying others.  And the ""controversy"" was a gift: it opened the Chicks' eyes hopefully to the pitiful, twisted souls of what was their fan base.

I put on headphones and listened to the whole CD in one sitting, something I haven't done since highschool. There's a folksy-rocky-bluesy feel to the CD. Every song is thoughtful and interesting, but the album really takes off at track #6, Lullaby. The best tracks are the life issues and social commentary tracks, but I don't mind that they spent several songs venting: receiving death threats over a comment is ridiculous, and besides, I think six or seven really great songs on a CD is pretty good. The vocals are as good as the music, which is saying something, because the music is great.;They're back and they're good.
866;220.0;5.0;23.0;"I may be a child of the 60s, but after listening to this CD I find myself thinking back to the poetry and rage that infused the rock era of the late 1960s. I am specifically reminded of Buffalo Springfield's, ""For What its Worth,"" by the third track, ""Not Ready to Make Nice."" Clearly the musical styles represent different genres and different ages. Yet, the passion of political protest cast within a clear melody and crisp musical skill make the two songs compatible as an outlet for frustration for a corrupt political system. In essence, this is music worth listening to because it transcends the vacuous nature of popular music.\n\nThis CD is important because it is a statement about life in our generation. Indeed, the sentiments are concerns that should ring true with each generation.\n\nThe members of the band were strong enough to proclaim their embarrassment the George W. Bush came from Texas. We should be proud that as Americans we have the freedom to speak truth to power. While me may show respect to the office, we are not obligated to show respect for the office holder who, in our opinion, has failed to represent the best interest of the nation.

I'm a New Yorker and not into country music at all but the writing on this album is so honest and beautiful that it transcends its genre.

Songs like ""Easy Silence"" make a reference to the pain they've gone through and the crazy times we live in as they discuss who will be the next person who is crucified. It's not all melancholy, though. ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is an anthem of defiance and one of several bold, aggressive songs on the album. See also ""Lubbock or Leave It.""

They have taken much needed time to regroup, enjoy their families, etc.  BUT, now, they have gotten back down to the business of making some great music.\n\nYes, there are some songs that are, obviously, responding and sharing on the emotions and rollercoaster ride that all the political hoopla caused.  I am glad they shared it.  It made me even more glad to have them back.\n\nPolitical stuff aside, the rest of the songs strike chords, emotionally and musically.  They do what all really good writing and arrangements should do - make you tear up or laugh AND make you think.  I have gone through each and every one of the ordeals they sing of and really found EVERY song to be very enjoyable and relevant, but even if only a couple are relevant to you, the rest are still great listening.\n\nAs with any recording one likes, a few songs will stick and run around in your head.  I am blown away by the fact that each one of these songs, at different times, has found its way into my psyche, and I find myself humming, even singing all of them even when the cd is not in the player.\n\nSo, my recommendation is a resounding ""YES!"" to those who might actually be looking at these reviews to determine whether or not to buy this latest offering.  To those just looking to identify with the DC's - YAHOO.  To those of you who just want to diss them with no real knowledge of the music - GET A LIFE!\n\nENJOY!!";INCREDIBLE WORK

649;237.0;5.0;22.0;"This is my first Dixie Chicks CD-- I'd often heard them on the radio, and enjoyed them, but since I'm not a huge country music fan, I passed them by when it came to actually owning a cd. Then after ""The Incident"" my curiosity piqued, not really because of what they said but because of the insane reaction to it! But again, I didn't think of them too seriously as musicians-- then came all the talk about the guys who'd worked on their new album and the fact that said album would be all about their experiences in the past 3 years, all which piqued my curiosity again. And to be honest, I bought this cd as almost 100% solidarity, without having downloaded any of their sogns.\n\nBut then I listened to it on the car on my way to work and went crazy! It's so lovely, so original, so nostalgic and heartbreaking, sort of a combination of the best bluegrass, old country, 70s rock, influences of the Beatles... Incredible!

The only song I ever heard them perform was the Landslide cover (which was beautiful!)\n\nI bought this album as soon as it went on sale to do my small part in sending a message to the false patriots out there that freedom of speech is for everyone, not just those you agree with.\n\nLeft to their own devices these false patriots (bush, hannity, limbo, Koby Teeth, the country music stations that have banned the Chicks, etc.) would silence those who disagree with them and turn our country into their own facist theocracy.\n\nI have yet to listen to the whole CD but ""The Long Way Around"" is great and ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is awesome; gives me chills!";Freedom of Speech Never Sounded So Good!

I hope they never stop making music!\n\nPolitically speaking, Natalie and the Chicks were practicing their RIGHT to freedom of speech, as they always have.  We should be applauding and supporting them for standing up for their convictions, not boycotting and smashing their cd's.  Furthermore, it is every American citizen's patriotic duty to question government.  If more people would read the Constitution and study a little more about American history they would understand that.  These are rights that our soldiers have fought so hard to defend since we left that little island across the Pacific.  You can agree with their political opinions, or not.  That's your right, too.

I'm afraid that any comments or reviews won't do Taking The Long Way justice; you simply MUST go and buy this album right now at your local record store, and if you love music you WILL love this album.\n\nThis is the kind of album that generations to come will be re-discovering and asking their parents, ""hey did you *know* about this awesome album?"" Mind you, this album is geared to a more mature audience than teenagers, and it reflects the maturity and growth of the Chicks. This is an album that 30 years from now, you'll still sit down to listen to and be blown away with its rich goodness, saying ""Wow, I can't believe how good this is...""\n\nTo the Dixie Chicks...thank you very much for this personal, meaningful, and musically rich album. To hear their voices blending together with the various instruments, the interplay of notes and sounds....oh my God, I can't even say any more. If you DON'T buy this record, you're missing out on a true gem and you're crazy. People who like shallow pap won't 'get' this record, musically or otherwise. I really liked the personal stories being told in each song, and kudos to the Chicks for writing their own songs on this record - you shine beautifully, ladies.\n\nI've heard a lotta music in my time...the Beatles, the Eagles, countless numbers of bands...and I can honestly say without a doubt that this is one of the best albums I've ever heard - I'd put it in the top three for me, for all time, and I'm not a gusher here, this really IS that good.\n\nAlso very cool was the contributions of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers' keyboardist, Bonnie Raitt for backup vocals on at least one track, and John Mayer doing lead guitar on a track also. Mind you, I always love it when Emily does lead guitar (and she rocks on the banjo, baby!).\n\nNatalie's voicework on this record is reallly, really good too (well all the Chicks sing so well on it).

769;244.0;5.0;22.0;For those of you who refuse to buy or listen to this disc, it's your loss. This is by far the best Dixie Chicks disc yet. The lyrics are gutwrenching, the music defies not only the bounds of country but many other genres as well, and the performances are breathtaking. It's a sad shame that so many people hold a mere opinion against them. Whatever happened to freedom of speech and expression? Whether we agree with the sentiment or not, which I do and I'm not ashamed to admit it, they had every right to say it. For those of you who accept art for art's sake, enjoy the disc and hang on to the hope that the Dixie Chicks will keep sharing their gift with us.;Your Loss...
784;245.0;5.0;22.0;"Frank Sinatra famously sang ""Regrets, I have a few,"" and when asking lead singer Natalie Maines of Dixie Chicks if she has any, she'll tell you of one major regret she has - she regrets apologizing to President George W. Bush for the remark she made three years ago on a London Stage. While on tour in 2003, the Lone Star state native told the British audience, ""Just so you know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas."" She now says of her subsequent act of making nice, ""I apologized for disrespecting the office of the President, but I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever."" I have to admit, when Maines made it clear she wasn't sorry, I had already become a major fan of this new CD without even hearing it. I was so proud of her for not backing down to one of the most immoral administrations in our nation's history. I knew I was going to love every song. Is that any way to review a new piece of art? Of course it isn't. That's why I'm thrilled and delighted that the latest disc from the Chicks, Taking The Long Way, is absolutely brilliant - BRILLIANT!!! Speaking of not making nice, ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the wonderful leadoff single released to radio. Although several country stations have banned playing Dixie Chicks forever, they're the losers for missing out on some of the best written and performed music of this decade. This is also the first time the Chicks have co-written every song on one entire album, and the lyrics are not only political, they're heartfelt, sweet and out `n out the edgiest rock-oriented sound that these chicks have ever chirped. Producer Rick Rubin, who is just coming off of the great success of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Diamond and Neil Young's latest epics, is the go-to man for a great rock and roll album. At the time of the album's commencement, Rubin stated, ""I think this should sound like a great rock act making a country album, not a country act making a rock album."" Maines concurred, ""It was a very different style of working. You have to learn to relax and be okay with experimenting. We just knew we wanted to do something different.""  And they have done something different. I always appreciated the Chicks for their vocals and their accolades (seven Grammy Awards), but I've never been wowed by an entire album of theirs - until now. I suppose the pop/rock angle of this album is what I love the most, not to mention Maines' powerhouse vocals and the trio's writing abilities. It's all here wrapped up neatly with a pretty bow on top. The only thing missing so far is a Best Album nomination. I suspect that will be their Christmas present when the Grammy nominations are announced next December. Until that time, enjoy this magnificent CD - it's one hour and five minutes of sheer democratic beauty.";Chicks Keep Chirpin' Beautifully
853;246.0;5.0;22.0;Freedom of speech. One of the many freedoms we are losing in this troubled time.

I give their willingness to stand up for what they believe in 10 stars!!\n\nAs for the album, They have again turned out another great album. I know when I buy a Dixie Chicks CD that I can play it and enjoy every song. Many groups have a few good songs on the CD and fill the rest of the space with garbage songs. Are you listening Reba? Amazon let's you hear a sample each song and you will be able to hear for yourself just how great the album is.\n\nAlso, do not pass up on a chance to see them in concert! They put on a great show!;Support freedom of speech! Buy ALL of their albums!

As a Texas ex-pat, all I can say is their music speaks for itself and their 2003 comments have held up in light of all that's been revealed about the current Bush administration's rush to war.  And the album is great, BTW.  Buy it!";Chicks are back bigtime!
868;248.0;5.0;22.0;I love this CD. It's the first Chicks CD I have gotten, and I am amazed by their mastery-- the genuinely sterling musicianship and sharp songcraft. How can I have been missing this?\n\nMusically, Long Way is full of choice and plummy melody lines that evoke Rubber Soul/Revolver era Beatles, and Sam Phillips at her luscious, inventive best. Even the lightest songs here are crossover country in the best sense, with all the drive and edge of power pop.\n\nThematically, Long Way bestrides the public and the private, the large politically and morally charged issue of our day, and the small, intimate search for the center in life. This is part of a brilliant and brilliantly felt scheme of counterpoint that weaves throughout Long Way. None of it feels forced, and it is frequently penetrating, thought-provoking and moving.\n\nThe Chicks are young moms and wives and sweethearts, yet they are 'old', wise and gifted poet-citizens of the world. Love their politics or hate it, it's the real world, the large and the small of it, the pretty and ugly of it, the euphoria and the sad ache of it, that is their muse. They are those blessed artists from whom adversity seems to have brought amazing work. Lucky them and lucky us.;Message Board trolls, your angry rants have no place among these reviews.

I think not.\n\nThere are quite a few people I've heard say ""I wouldn't buy their album because they're un-American""!!  In fact, the opposite is true - they are completely American.  They spoke their minds because that's what Americans are free to do.\n\nAnd if the only thing you take away from this music is that Natalie Maines is fat, you have missed the point entirely and in doing so, missed out on a wonderful collection of songs that say so much about so many aspects of life - not just about the war and the controversy.";Listen carefully so you don't miss the point or the music

1001;252.0;5.0;22.0;When I first heard the Chicks back in 98 or 99 , I thought of them as typical run-of-the-mill Country music ( I like Pink Floyd,ZZ TOP, and mostly guitar rock.) . Then I heard the song Let Him Fly and was impressed but didn't become a convert, but then I heard Home and was blown away. Amazing. This is CD is just as good, although a bit different. I Like It, Taking the Long Way, Bitter End, Everybody Knows are my favorites so far, but all the songs are GREAT. If your someone who won't listen to it because of their political views - too bad for you and your narrow minds, you'll be missing some great music.;Buy this CD!!!
206;253.0;5.0;21.0;"In reading some of the reviews for this album, I am amazed at how many people have expressed opinions, while stating that they have not heard, nor would they listen to the music in question.  In some circles, that would be called prejudice.\n\nSo, to clear the air on that point, I strongly disagree with the comments that Natalie Maines made concerning President Bush in 2003.  So?  Seriously, the First Amendment exists for the benefit of the voices of dissent--universally popular expressions of ideas need no protection.\n\nNow, about the music.  This album is striking in its level of honesty and maturity.  The first time that I heard ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", I could not stop smiling.  How easy it would have been to make a contrite, public, and disengenuous apology in the interest of saving their careers.  Instead, the Chicks have held to their guns in a disarmingly honest piece of work.  Brilliant.\n\nThe rest of the album is equally good.  Worth the wait.\n\nI have always been a fan of the Dixie Chicks' music.  Now, having proven that their principles are important enough to them to risk their careers, they have my respect.  The ability to state such dissent is at the core of what made all of the sacrifices in this nation's history worthwhile.  And to have the (equally valid) backlash answered in such an artistic manner is just a bonus.\n\nI still disagree with their politics, by the way.";The Long Way, Indeed.

The funny thing to me is that, even though you know what several of these songs are referring to, they can fit anyone's life; both the good things and the  bad.  Not many (hardly any, actually) artists can make me cry, but the Dixie Chicks can and do, everytime.  There are songs to fit almost any emotional state you're in, and they are perfect for singing in your car - all alone - with the windows rolled up - and you can sing (or SCREAM) along with them.

232;257.0;5.0;21.0;I bought the CD after seeing the Not Ready video and it is amazing.  It's such a powerful song that I doubted the rest of the CD could live up to it.  But man was I wrong.  There's at least 5 more top of the chart worthy songs on here and not a loser in the bunch.  If people aren't listening to the CD because of politics they are truly missing out.  This music really speaks to the heart.  So many of the songs are relevant to where I am in life right now (married with young kids and aging parents) and I often find myself crying while listening.  One of my favorite songs on the CD is Silent House because it skillfully evokes the feeling of having lost someone before they actually die.  Another favorite is Baby Hold On.  Maines has such a unique voice and the the lyrics are beautifully written.  I am glad the chicks have found their voice and their music now shows a maturity I never thought they were capable of.

It touches on important topics, dealing with a loved one's Alzheimers Disease, fallout from ""the comment"" and the most important thing of all. Hope.

""I Hope"" is simply a stunning song.  One I would love to hear from our contemporary church choir.  ""Easy Silence"" is a beautiful, smooth song that I can listen to again and again.

The lead cut from their latest disc, ""Taking the Long Way"", starts off a musical journey that, for those of us out here who've been ignorant of the groups' talent, both as songwriters and performers, is a sure-fire hook. That song, ""The Long Way Around"", plainly and simply rocks, bringing to the forefront the vocals of the group, a stellar line-up of behind the scenes talent, and clever lyrics. From there on, the disc only gets better.

I thought that she should have had the courage to make the statement at home, rather than abroad. I decided at that point that I would join the boycott of the Dixie Chicks. Thankfully, I ended the boycott with the release of ""Taking the Long Way"".\n\nThis is one of the most powerful collections of songs on one album that I have ever heard. Perhaps Ms. Maines needed to be sufficiently teed off in order to produce such incredible music. I have never purchased any of the Dixie Chicks' records before this one. Looks like I chose the right time to invest in their music. Natalie Maines' lead vocals are unbelievable and the harmonies from sisters Martie and Emily are mezmerizing.\n\nIt would be a travesty of the highest magnitude to let this group disappear. I can't remember a time when I listened to an album and loved all of the tracks. Each one seems better than the previous. It hearkens me back to the day when The Beatles would release an album and every song would be a winner.\n\nA note to Natalie Maines: Remember, you have the right to say whatever you want and others have the right to disagree with you.

If you can't relate to more than one or two of these songs you just haven't lived life. I'll be honest I loved ""Home"" and it's acoustic sound. Sometimes I do feel this new album is a little over produced but then I find myself finding new things to like with every listen. In the last decade or so I'd rate it right up there with Neil Youngs' ""Harvest Moon"", Springsteens' ""The Rising"",  Alan Jacksons' ""Drive"" or Kenny ""Buffet"" Chesneys' No Shirt, No Shoes..."". Along with ""Home"" and all those great old albums by the Eagles, Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and even Garth Brooks I can see me playing this for a long time. Like good music it touches the heart, the soul, and even the frustration and hurt we all feel, and it does it with melodies that stick, and musicianship that shows talent. It's striking that I hear so many touches in this album that remind me of the great music of the past, and that music is from rock, pop, country, as well as folk, and then there's even that last bluesy hopeful, ""I Hope"" to end the album. I've already given this CD to 3 friends because I know they will be touched by the songs on here as well. Great job ladies--it's the music--I need an album like this every now and then, Thank You.";It's the music - and that's all!
627;271.0;5.0;21.0;regardless of the political hype that surrounds the dixie chicks, this cd is the real deal.  i've been listening to it in the car and i don't skip a single track!  it sounds strange to say, but in many ways this cd makes me proud...proud to be a woman, proud to be capable of independent thought, proud be able to make my own choices.  rock on ladies!;Great from start to finish
641;272.0;5.0;21.0;"I have been stunned by the amount of vitriol shown these talented ladies. Vitriol heaped upon them because of something one of them said.  Even on this website there are reviews written by people who obviously have not really listened to the album, but felt it necessary to write a mean-spirited review.  The fact that Natalie's sentiments about the war are now felt by the majority of Americans does not enter into the conversation.  In the absolutely beautiful ""Lullaby"" the Chicks sing:\n\nHow long do you want to be loved?\n\nIs forever enough? Is forever enough?\n\nHow long do you want to be loved?\n\nIs forever enough.. because I am never ever giving you up.\n\nIt seems that they are not only singing to a lover but about the making of their music.  This album is a superb, heartfelt album.  Contrary to what some have said this album is not an angry treatise on the war and a total move away from country, but great music with country creds intact.  Even the defiant ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" stands on its own as a great song.  It is nice to see that this song is becoming a hit even though country radio has ingored it (#1 VH-1 song, last week moving up 35 places on the Billboard Pop Chart to #39 after almost disappearing).  From ""Lubbuck or Leave"" to ""Easy Silence"" and the title song, the Chicks prove that they are one of the best things to come along in music in the last 10 years.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks have been under attack before. The song ""Goodbye Earl"" got them in trouble because they suggested that an abused woman should kill her husband with tongue in cheek. They refused to back down and apologize for that song and do not need to apologize for anything now. Great music speaks for itself. Country has tried to ignore this album but it debuted at #1 on the Billboard Country Chart. It is obvious that many people in country knew that it is all about the music.  Give this album a listen...";When it comes down to it... It is about the music
711;273.0;5.0;21.0;"I always find it funny when people get so enraged by a celebrity voicing a political opinion that differs from theirs.  ""Who cares what they think?"" the offend party shouts as they round up CDs to take to the dumpster and photographs of said celebrity to destroy.  Well, obviously THEY care what the celebrity thinks, otherwise why such a visceral reaction?  As someone who does NOT care that a celebrity voices an opinion, I care only about the music on this CD which, I must say, is very, very good.\n\nSure, I will admit to missing to more acoustic twang of previous Chick releases but I also support their desires to grow as artists and this CD accomplishes a lot of that.  Songs like ""Taking the Long Way,"" ""Easy Silence"" and ""Everybody Knows"" show real growth in the songwrting department and express a new maturity for the trio.  Other songs, such as ""Favorite Year"" are simply warm to the ears a factor enhanced by a nice string arrangement.\n\nNone of this is likely to go over well with country radio (although since country radio is all over non-country acts like Shania Twain) but given that country radio is largely owned by corporate interests that would have been unlikely regardless of what kind of music they made.\n\nIf you are a fan of earlier Chicks music this might take a little getting used to, but this is an album that has LOTS of rewards for those willing to listen.";A Bold Step Forward
759;274.0;5.0;21.0;"As a non-country music, college educated professional who spent 24 years in Texas, leaving in 1988 and never looking back,my thoughts are that this album has heart and talent all throughout it. Practically all the songs are very accessible to people of all musical tastes and speak to us of the adult challenges we all face-whether blue state or red state lovers.  The Chicks are highly talented musicians who continue to evolve.  Oh, and they are right about Lubbock.  Buddy Holly was reviled by many in the Lubbock populace in the 1950's for playing what was seen as that ""black people's"" rock n roll and marrying a Hispanic.  Ask his widow if you doubt me.\n\nOf course, now they celebrate him.";Ignoring this music over politics would be a huge mistake
770;275.0;5.0;21.0;"I am not a country fan and it's becoming more evident each day why that is. However, I think ""Taking The Long Way"" will be the best record released this year. It shows an emotional growth not often found in any musical genre, especially country. The songwriting, singing, musicianship, and production all are superb. Way to come back swinging, ladies, and not lay down and sacrifice your principles for the sake of money or fame.\n\nThere is a sense of passion and urgency here that dwarfs their earlier work. The songs seem more personal and real. Rick Rubin's production is excellent as always. He helped to recruit the all star co-writing team and session musicians for this project and the result is like a combination of super groups that should be unrivaled in sales and awards this year. It's like all the start aligned just so in a rare moment of harmony and magic.\n\nFor the first time the ladies wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on a record, and it shows. The songs are intimate and compelling. There's no filler in the bunch.\n\nI would highly recommend this album to anyone who apreciates good, heart felt, real music.";Record of the Year

Just in time for Memorial Day road-tripping (it might just make you forget about the $3.00/gallon gasoline!).\n\nI really do love the powerful lyrics and feisty tone of this CD (my favorite song--""I Hope"").  No, it's not all sunshine and light, but artists' work is often a reflection of what's been going on in their lives, and they've certainly been through a lot the last couple years.  I'm glad to see them coming back strong!!\n\nThe first copy I bought for me, because I like the Dixie Chicks' music.  The other five copies I bought for friends--that's my little way of saying that whether or not I like what is said, I value our right as Americans to say it, and I'll support people who stand up for that right.";Loved it--and bought 5 more for friends
918;279.0;5.0;21.0;"But I love these Chicks. As with any exceptional artist, they are able to give us something not unrecognizable, yet completely fresh, almost new.  Most Country artists (and I use the term ""artist"" loosley) will take their style in circles, we see the same guy or gal singing the same song (with diffent lyrics) the same way throughout the course of their careers. A pure artist style is circumferencial, but instead of the same circle, it is more reminicent of an upward spiral, moving to the next level, but still apart of the same structure. That is what makes these women so refreshing, they can launch up their style to the moon yet stay anchored to Texas.";I HATE COUNTRY MUSIC....
960;280.0;2.0;21.0;"So, I want to make this review as fair as possible. I am a Dixie Chicks fan and want them to succeed, but by writing this review I also feel responsible for your music purchases, the money you spend, as well as making it fair for other arists in the genre.\n\nSo many people have waited for this album to come out that it has topped the Amazon sales rank before it even came out. As a fan I was hoping for a humble positive country album with beautiful harmonies, great chord progressions and a great sound. I needed to face it, it's not such an album. In terms of the music I think the producing is not really on the Dixie Chicks level. The chord progressions are quite boring and the sound is kind of loud and empty. You can hear that the Chicks are fighting on this album, fighting for keeping the success. But Dixie Chicks, it's not about success, it's about YOU having a gift that is unique and should be wisely spent!\n\nThe album is not totally bad, there are some ok songs on it like ""Favorite year"" and ""I hope"". But overall, I think they were not ready for this album. I give them 2 stars because I think that's a really fair rating...";They were not ready for this album
974;281.0;5.0;21.0;I really like this CD - I have been listening to it on their MSN website, while waiting for the copy I bought.\n\nThe music is quality and inspiring - just the perfect combination. I'd love to see where they take it from here.;A New Dixie Chick Fan
105;282.0;5.0;20.0;"First, let's get politics out of the way.  Freedom of speech -- need I say more?  What Natalie Maines said three years ago, 68% of the country now feels.  Natalie just had the guts to say it first -- and the Dixie Chicks paid a very dear price for speaking out.  What a shame.  I thought this country was based on certain foundational freedoms.  I am sorry for what the Dixie Chicks endured.  Through them, for some inexplicable reason, we had to learn all over again our rights as free-thinking citizens.  It's not like celebrities have never spoken out, people.  Barbra Streisand, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Marlon Brando, Vanessa Redgrave, Jane Fonda....on and on.  The Dixie Chicks paid a price for saying what many famous people have been saying for years -- what they believe in!  What a pile of utter nonsense.\n\nNow for the music -- because that's what it's really all about -- or should be all about.  I have never purchased a Dixie Chicks album and know nothing of their past music.  I purchased this album because I heard the song, ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" on the web and thought it was incredibly written and performed.  You feel the pain, anger, doubt in every word.  This is not country music, folks.  This is adult contemporary music that is grade A.  The first 6 songs are all absolute winners...then a few okay songs...then the CD finishes strong with 3 very excellent songs.\n\nThere is a lot to be learned from listening to these songs -- about how our actions, once taken, cannot be reversed.  That we need to stand behind ourselves and our beliefs no matter what happens (in the case of the Dixie Chicks -- death threats, boycotts, vilification in the press and by the radio stations and fickle fans who abandoned them).  The songs are about believing in yourself, leaning on your loved ones, learning about what is really important through the birth of a child, finding out who your friends really are (and aren't), and finding, in the pitch black darkness, the strength to come back against great odds.\n\nThe Grammy awards were well-deserved for the MUSIC and the power of these songs.  If you know nothing about the Dixie Chicks and what they have endured, the songs will be an inspiration about overcoming extreme obstacles and surviving life's hardest blows.  These are universal messages that anyone can learn from, regardless of personal political convictions.\n\nThank you Dixie Chicks for the great MUSIC -- for getting back to what you do best.";An album of angst for saying what they believe...
111;283.0;5.0;20.0;"The Grammy Awards for this album are not a fluke.\n\nIf you think for a second that the only reason why the Dixie Chicks cleaned up the Grammy Awards is because of the ""Hollywood Left"" or ""Secular Left"" or whatever are just trying to make a point, I'm afraid that you are sadly mistaken.\n\nMany of those who criticize the album have a problem with the band, and not the album.  In fact, if you ask a lot of them if they have listened to the album before they criticize it, you will most likely get this response: ""I don't need to listen to it.  I don't like them period and I would never use my money to support them... etc.""\n\nAnd that's sad.\n\nOnce you listen to the songs you will understand why the record sales of ""Taking the Long Way"" have long eclipsed Bill O'Reilly's prediction that the album of 2 million in sales (interesting I have not heard anything about their sales numbers on his show- and I watch every night).\n\nAnyway, if you are thinking about getting this album, I give it my highest recommendation.  You will not be disappointed.  No matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on.";Go girls
214;284.0;5.0;20.0;This forum is intended for reviews of music, so put all the politics and a need to keep artists stagnant aside. Open your mind and carefully listen to one of the most superbly crafted albums of the last 25 years.\n\nThis record grabs your head and your heart and won't let them go until the journey is over.  The sumptuous production values, passionate musicianship, stellar vocal performances, and earnestly personal songwriting (which is loaded with powerful yet gorgeous and hummable hooks) galvanize this record into an instant classic.\n\nIMHO, musical brilliance is so much more meaningful if the artist also simultaneously and intuitively understands how to share and connect with a diverse audience on an emotional basis, and there is no doubt that the DXC have succeeded here. I get lumps in my throat with this album when I least expect it, and I am just a regular guy.\n\n  I never thought this would ever happen at my tender age of 52, but this album is so great on so many levels, it has pushed it's way into my hallowed and entrenched Top Ten list of favorite records of all time.

350;290.0;5.0;20.0;I give the Chicks a lot of credit for speaking their mind and criticizing Bush when he was popular. (I respect them less for backing down and apologizing.) Now, Natalie Maines has spoken out against patriotism and, again, she has shown that she is unafraid to say things that many Americans don't want to hear. Patriotism is just extreme nationalism that leads to racism and xenophobia.  People should stop waiving the flag and listen the music on this CD instead.

The Chicks don't disappoint. However ... and please don't flame me on this ... I strongly prefer their earlier CDs musically and instrumentally. Why? I miss the bluegrass and acoustic elements. While they're here as salt and pepper in the mix, Rick Rubin's production leans every track into 70s-era FM-ready country-rock in the Eagles/Asylum Records/Jackson Browne/et al mold. Yes ... the 70s Asylum catalog is a priceless section of my music collection. But that doesn't mean I want THAT sound with TODAY'S Dixie Chicks CDs. So ... four stars, not five.

545;295.0;5.0;20.0;First, let me say I am not a country music fan.  As a matter of fact, I loathe most country, however, the songs on this CD are some of the best of the year.  The Long Way Around is a California-rock inspired rollicking good ride. Lullaby is beautiful and very touching.  Not Ready to Make Nice is destined to become a classic.

This is the same red herring the right has been spewing out about Natalie Maines for the past three years to distract attention from the fact that they hate the freedom we have to disagree with Bush.  If it was just that she made her comments in England, then way is it the virtually every other celebrity who has criticized Bush ON US SOIL has also come under attack and boycott threats from the right?

I think ten, twenty years from now these musicians will stand out as patriotic heroines who actually made this country safer by insisting on the preservation of a fundamental American right: freedom of expression.  Presidents come and go; but the American bill of rights is sacred and must be preserved indefinitely for future generations to enjoy.\n\n--\n\nUPDATE: for the past two days I have listened to the entire album several more times, and now I'll proceed with the nitty gritty review of the musical merits of this album  First of all, the set of songs is a wonderful tapestry of American contemporary music: pop, ballads, country, rock, blues. There is a little bit of everything for everyone. Secondly, the percussion by drummer Chad Smith is outstanding.  Steady, catchy, funky percussion rhythm while making sure not to overshadow the vocals and the accompanying instruments.  A master doing his thing.\n\nThird of all, I am amazed by Natalie Maine's vocal range, versatility and stylization.  The Texan accent is still there, which means she can make any song country in a heartbeat. Natalie is more than country however; she can rock with the best of them and not miss a beat on her vocals.  Her voice is extremely versatile in that she can show her bluegrass side, and then in the next passage belt out her rock side; and then switch to country in the next moment. She can do so naturally and originally without sounding mechanical or coached.\n\nNatalie is well known in the industry for not oversinging, and staying in pitch meaning that she is pleasant to the ear. I played the album from my room, and was hearing it across the hall and I could still decipher every word of each song. This is a result of her having good diction; plus having a solid midrange voice.  If you are a fan of American Idol, Natalie Maines blows them away because all contestants I've seen end up oversinging.  Oversinging means trying so hard to impress the judges by resorting to fancy vocal pyrotechnics which at the end causes the singer to lose control of his/her natural voice. Natalie on the other hand has become a master at her craft, and without a doubt working with such talents as Bonnie Raitt and Sheryl Crowe must have helped her a ton. I must say her Texan accent comes across very appealing (and sensual), and also helps her in having a distinct voice. You can tell right away who is singing.\n\nLast but not least, the strings simply jam/rock and transport the listener to auditory bliss.  There are couple of electric guitar riffs ala Santana/Prince, plus mandolin, fiddle and banjo jam sessions that get your head bobbing up and down in approval.\n\nTo summarize, this album is the output of three outstanding musicians working together with masterful songwriters, instrumentalists, and producers and the result is synergistic/magical music.  At the end of course it's all signature Dixie Chicks and not just another rock or pop band wannabe.\n\nI predict four or five more top 5 hit songs all from this album: Easy Silence is my favorite song.  This album's musical greatness makes the previous albums by the Dixie Chicks sound sophomore-ish in comparson. This in spite of the high quality work that they had done before.  So, forget about the politics and crank this album up and enjoy the ride.";tristan
767;306.0;5.0;20.0;"This new set from Dixie Chicks is extremely strong.  Many artists who develop a body of work reach a point where they either get criticized for continuing to sound the same or for changing.  Growth requires change; and the Chicks are moving forward.  ""Taking the Long Way"" co-written with Dan Wilson from Semisonic and Trip Shakespeare is an excellent title track opener with a strong Texas rebellious streak, ""Wouldn't kiss all the as*es they told me to.""  ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is a powerful anthem that rocks relentlessly with Natalie's protest, ""And how in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that they'd write me a letter sayin' that I better shut up & sing or my life will be over?""  My family first heard the lovely song ""Lullaby"" played in the season closing episode of NBC's ""The Medium"" and wanted to know what song it was.  Again written with Dan Wilson, the soothing lyric and languid tempo makes this a stunning track on this set, ""How long do you want to be loved?  Is forever enough?""  One of my favorite blues musicians, Keb' Mo', joins the Chicks on the bouncy ""I Hope"" that seeks joy & laughter over killing and bloodshed, ""It's okay for us to disagree; we can work it out lovingly.""  Also strong is the lovely ""Silent House"" co-penned by Crowded House's Neil Finn with a lovely melody ""I'll remember the years when your mind was clear how the laughter & love filled up this silent house.""  ""I Like It"" & ""Baby Hold On"" are also stellar tracks.  Dixie Chicks are expanding musically.  ""Taking the Long Way"" delivers an entrancing set, born of equal parts turmoil and love.  Enjoy!";Is Forever Enough?
795;307.0;5.0;20.0;"It's interesting to me, as a fan of music that's never even seen the inside of the Billboard top 100, how much emphasis has been placed on whether or not the Chicks have made an album filled with hits. Guess that's not unusual for Nashville, where ""records"" (i.e., singles) rule the roost, and an album is only as good as the sum of its commercial parts (and yes, I know that's not just Nashville).\n\nAlthough much of the talk here has centered on red state, blue state, blah, blah, blah...the fact is the Dixie Chicks have done something far more radical than start a political slap fight. Musically, artistically, they've decided that they want out of the genre straitjacket, that making music of personal importance matters more to them than guaranteeing their next quadrillion-seller. Which is exactly what thousands of others, who have essentially no shot at the mainstream music gravy, do every day. They make music because they're called to do so, impelled by something inside of them that simply won't shut up, whatever their financial prospects.\n\nWhat's the radical part? The biggest selling group of women in music history, who previously skated by on the merest hint of sass and defiance, have had to decide which way the spirit lies, on a national stage, with millions upon millions of people watching. It's as if Elvis, back on the day he made his deal with the devil, decided to tell Col. Tom Parker exactly where he could put his Hollywood contract, thank you very much, he'd rather go sling hash in a Memphis juke joint than kiss another puckered posterior.\n\nIn case you're wondering, yes, I've listened to the album, repeatedly for days, and I love it. Like I said, my taste leans generally far from the mainstream (Iris DeMent or Mission of Burma, anyone?), but instinct told me to give this one a spin. And what I found was three women in their thirties, all with babies at home, struggling valiantly (and beautifully) with the moral and spiritual pitfalls of the life process, with an honesty and directness that no amount of country-clever Nashville sheen could ever embody, or even consider.\n\nI think the Chicks put their unwitting feet in their mouths a few years back, not because they're dangerous political radicals (I mean, come on, I've said worse things in Sunday school), but because they wanted to be artists, and on some unconscious level they needed to screw up bad enough to have the freedom to become exactly that. And on all levels, I think they've succeeded.";Radical, but in a different way
67;308.0;5.0;19.0;"A smirking smile at all of those little pecker-headed country stations that dropped the Dixie Chicks. Reborn in fire, the band has an edge now; the material is honest and without the phony pop appeal, have delivered a real, solid album.\n\nThis is a really fine album and all controversy aside, they do ""shut up and sing"" really, really well. Well written, well-produced and one more on my shelf.\n\nIronic, isn't it, that generations of pop musicians have flipped the bird at power symbols from presidents to the pope but let straight talk come from a southern gal's lips and some fall-in-line whitebreads can't cope. so, if the Chicks drop their country ways, no big deal: REAL country folk would've stood up to protect their ladies, not let them get trampled by McCarthyists of the new Millennium.";Chicks stay awesome
825;309.0;2.0;20.0;I'm a big fan. This one is not thier best work. I loved their first three albums, this latest I have to say does not follow. seems like they're deviating a bit from what they do best. Listening to it actually brought me down. unlike their previous works;disappointed
826;310.0;5.0;20.0;This is the best album yet by the wonderful Dixie Chicks!  I'm so glad that they continued to stand up for what they believe in and didn't roll over and play dead when someone got offended.  Since when do celebrities not have the same rights that the rest of us are supposed to have in this country?  Why should the Dixie Chicks be penalized because of their OPINIONS?  Wether you agree with them or not, what does that have to do with anything?  If you don't agree with them, you can still like their music.  If you do agree with them, you can still dislike their music.  This country gives us the freedom to say what we feel and I do not understand why anyone would want anyone to have the right taken away. Boycotting a musician because of their political views is silly.  Would you want someone telling you that you were unable to continue at your job because of how you felt about politics?\n\nI've been a huge fan of the Dixie Chicks since their first album and with each new one they get better and stronger.  They're latest is the best and I'm proud to be a CHICK FAN!;best album yet - don't they have rights too?
836;311.0;5.0;20.0;"True Patriotism is standing up and saying ""Hell, NO!"" when you get knocked down for speaking your truth.  The Dixie Chicks are back and better than ever. Unapologetic as any Strong Devoted American! They stand tall in what they've stood through and have never backed down from.  There is anger and grief and righteousness in this cd but it is weaved into so much compassion and grief for what has happened in this country as well as their own lives. There is also tenderness, love, joy, and sadness for lossing grandmother to Alzheimers....a sweet and heartwrenching song.\n\nThis is a brilliant cd.\n\n""Lullabye"" will be playing during our wedding procession next spring and ""I hope"" will be playing at our church every Sunday.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks have come back and NO, this cd is not as country as the others. After the sensless, unAmerican, ugly, and INSANE bashing the Chicks took from the country music base, a tribute to country music is not deserved.\n\nGod Bless the Chicks and I too ""hope  there must be a way to change what's going on .....I hope for more love, more joy and laughter.""";God Bless the Dixie Chicks
840;312.0;5.0;20.0;I've read numerous articles stating the Country music has basically blacklisted the Chicks. If they would have released a pure country cd it would have totally flopped. Atleast now, they have a chance of crossing over. If you're angry about it not being country then perhaps you should call your country radio station out for not playing them.\n\nPersonally, I don't know why country music gave them this treatment? The polls are showing that most of the USA really doesn't care for Bush anyway.\n\nAs for the cd, it's typical Chicks energy and sound. I agree it's no Wide open spaces but the cd is great to say the least.\n\nI can't wait to see them in Concert !;A comment for those that are complaining about the fact that the cd isn't country enough
848;313.0;5.0;20.0;I had never heard the Dixie Chicks and I don't listen to country stations.  I bought the CD as a show of political support for their views but mostly for their right to say what they thought without fearing death threats.  Once I listened to it, I realized it was wonderful!  The melodies, the harmonies, the messages, and mostly the passion were outstanding!;A contemporty folk fan LOVES this
873;314.0;5.0;20.0;if everyone could just put aside all there narrow mindedness, and actually LISTEN to the record, all the haters will see that they are truly gifted.  There songs all have a message, not all political, but content none the less.  Which is A LOT more then most music out there now a days.  I highly reccomend this album to everyone, my husband who hates country music loves it.;This is the best
911;315.0;5.0;20.0;The Dixie Chicks prove (again) why they are one of the biggest acts in music. Every album is something new, even as they stay rooted to what is essentially them. As Home was distinct from their previous two efforts, Taking The Long Way won't be confused with anything else they've done. The album contains some of the best material they've ever recorded including the gorgeous Easy Silence, the bittersweet Bitter End and the melancholy Favorite Year. I wasn't sure what to expect but I am thrilled with this album. I've listened to it five times through now and it gets better with every listen.;And the Chicks keep moving on. Fantastic!

This forum is one to post reviews of the CD and those of us that have purchased it, are doing so.  This effort by the Chicks is yet another example of beautiful harmonizing and raw talent that three girls from Texas have arranged for my pleasure.\n\nSo the Chicks had an opinion, good for them to have the audacity to voice it.  Agree or disagree, they are talented musicians and have managed to strike a chord with this listener yet again.\n\nLong live the music of these girls!;Long Way Home - chicks, we're glad you're back!
952;318.0;5.0;20.0;"I've been a chicks fan for as long as I can remember, so naturally I had high expectations for this long-anticipated album. It completely exceeded any expectations that I had. The sound is more diverse and varied than anything else in country today. This album is country for people who hate country. The instrumentation is great- very rich and interesting without being overdone. The songwriting is wonderful and so much deeper than anything I've ever heard them do. ""Lubbock or Leave It"" is a sizzling, energetic romp, ""I Hope"" is a beautiful, soulful blues-rock tune, and ""Lullaby"" will absolutely give you chills the first time you here it. There are no bad, or even mediocore tracks on this absolutely stellar album. If you buy one album this year, make ""Taking the Long Way"" that album.";One Word: AMAZING!
961;319.0;5.0;20.0;"(from an extended feature, copyright 2006 Michael F. Hopkins)\n\nThe Dixie Chicks hit the record stores with their\nfirst album in three years, and it's a safe bet\nthat TAKING THE LONG WAY will not be music which\nanyone takes lightly. While there are those who\nwill measure this CD solely by their political\naffiliation, a look at the potency of the music\nand the balanced nature of their perspectives\nwill settle any debate about the ladies' right\nto speak their minds.\nSimply put, this is The Dixie Chicks at their\nfinest. From hard-hitting to serenading, taking\nlyrical shots at narrow-mindedness, reflecting\nupon complex issues as well as the simple things\nwhich mean the most, this album is a portrait\nin courage and artistic fire.\n\nThose who appreciated the finesse of the classic\nHOME will be floored by the even deeper integrity\nand diversity of TAKING THE LONG WAY. The DC brand\nof down home is sharply attuned here, the ladies\nco-writing every selection for this album. Think\nthe hate campaigns of the past few years have\nsilenced their art?

121;321.0;5.0;19.0;"Like quite a number of reviewers here, I'm not really into country music, and the only Dixie Chicks song I'd heard before this album was their contribution to ""Another Rosie Christmas"" by Rosie O'Donell; ""Merry Christmas from the family"", which was a fun song.\n\nTheir latest album has a pop/soft rock sound, with enough fiddle, banjo, violin and organ to give a country tinge. Much like seventies Fleetwood Mac, or The Eagles.\n\nOpening is the upbeat ""The long way around"", a sunny melodic rocker perfectly showcasing the Chicks tight harmonies. Other songs in a similar vein are the lovely ""Everybody knows"", the sixties sounding blues tinged  ""I like it"", and the more driving, raging ""Lubbock or leave it"" (a retort at their hometown for the way they were treated).\n\nWhere the album stands out however is in the ballads: ""Easy silence"", the Grammy winning ""Not ready to make nice"" (which goes from gentle verses to defiant chorus to match the lyrics), the tender melancholic stripped down ""Lullaby"" (with guitars and vocals pushed to the fore), ""Silent house"" (a forlorn ballad sung in the empty house left behind by a loved one), the enchanting ""Baby hold on"" (with its sixties girl group feel), and the optimistic hymn-like ""I hope"" with its wish for a better world with love and laughter.\n\nMy favourite song has got to be the brilliant nostalgic and highly melodic ballad ""Favorite year"", with heartfelt lyrics about puppy love, a yearning vocal performance, and excellent guitar. Stunning!!!\n\nGreat songwriting, harmonies and musicianship; John Mayer, Bonnie Raitt, and a few Red Hot Chili Peppers are in attendance, make for a CD I'm glad I got.";An apolitical review from a new Chicks Fan!!
213;322.0;5.0;19.0;I bought my first Dixie Chicks CD as a show of support for free speech - whether or not one agrees with the content of that speech.  I had never heard a single song of theirs until a couple months ago.  In fact, I had listened to almost no country music since the disco fad ended and I could go back to the rock stations again.\n\nWhen I did finally listen to my first Dixie Chicks CD, the surprising thing was that I really enjoyed the music.  Thanks, big corporate broadcasters.  By trying to suppress the Dixie Chicks, you've succeeded in bringing a whole new audience to them.;What a pleasant surprise!
217;323.0;2.0;19.0;"I should have known - this album is just for the diehard fans. How good the Chicks were on Wide Open Spaces, this falls far, far short of my expectations. Ballad after ballad, the album fails to deliver. Strong harmonies, sure. Good vocal sound, OK, it's there. But albums are ultimately about a story; if they are not, I'm not interested. I'd rather go to a place like iTunes and purchase the songs I really like and skip the rest. 'Taking the long way' lacks the story I am looking for, the composition as a complete album, a sense of integration if you will, synthesis. And that's what I should have known before rushing to buy the CD on Amazon right when it came out: the price says everything. If it's really a rock-solid album, it won't be on sale for just under 10 bucks. They'll want more because they know it's worth more. This is just to fill the Chicks' coffers and they should be ashamed for doing that to their fans. Two stars at best.";The low price is a giveaway

Great lyrics wonderful rifts-these women are a talented force to be reckoned with.  For those who thinks that musicians should shut up and sing-since when does that happen?  From the sixties on, musicians and actors alike have tipped their hats in the political ring.  Heck, we even had a former president that was in the entertain industry and a whole lot of governors and senators.

I do believe in free speech and expression and that is what this country is built on.  How dare anyone try to criticize anyone else just for what they believe or say?  I have never understood why someone who has the ability to think for themselves attacks someone else for thier views.  Maybe it's because they CAN'T think for themselves!!  I say listen to everyone's views and decide for yourself what you believe in...or don't believe in. Anyway...hooray for the Dixie Chicks!  One of the years best CD's!;Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!!!  CD

691;340.0;5.0;19.0;I have never bought a dixie chicks cd before and i will admit to buying this one because the chicks have been so defiant in regards to idiots who don't like them for their political views or what they said about the president.  Also, i have never bought a cd by a country group or artist but i wanted to support the chicks for standing up to the morons in this country.  I am glad i bought it because its a very enjoyable cd.  I absolutely LOVE I'm not ready to make nice!!!!  All the songs have nice melodies and are very catchey.;Cute little album
709;341.0;5.0;19.0;"I am a die hard Dixie Chicks fan, I love all of their music including this new cd.  I appreciate their honesty and their willingness to voice their opinions and stand behind them with no regrets.  I am ashamed at the way people in our ""Free"" Country responded to their comments of free speech.  How can a nation that stands firmly on freedom of speech and religion, judge them for merely making a comment?  I am so glad they are back, yes this album is a little different but still the same beautiful music with meaningful words.  The melodies are just Wonderful.  As long as they make the music, I will continue to buy it.  LONG LIVE THE CHICKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  May God Bless them abundantly.";FINALLY - THEY ARE BACK
722;342.0;5.0;19.0;"What a comeback! This is the Dixie Chicks best work to date. The songs are courageous and address their personal issues but most importantly, these are songs that you remember and want to hear again and again. The harmonies, instruments (especially that guitar!) and lyrics are amazing. I like every song on this cd with the exception of ""Lubbock or Leave It"" which is too honky-tonk for me. Everything else is first-rate, especially the first release ""Not Ready to Make Nice."" Other memorable tracks include the hauntingly beautiful ""Lullaby,"" ""Easy Silence,"" ""Baby Hold On,"" ""Taking the Long Way,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" and ""Voice Inside My Head."" A classic cd experience!";Defiant, creative, good music!
723;343.0;5.0;19.0;"I have to tell you that my political beliefs are polar opposite of the Dixie Chicks for the most part, although, I appreciate that their heart is in the right place, although perhaps at times perhaps they could have chosen their words more carefully, but at least they are bold enough to say what they feel and what they mean!  In any event, despite their political outbursts that caused such negative publicity for the group, this is a magnificent CD!  It is flawless in my opionion!  The 3rd track, ""I'm Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the kind of song that I can listen to again and again and apply it to just about any personal experience in my own life where I have felt hurt and judged.  I am not a true country music fan either but then again, I don't think this is necessarily a ""country"" CD, and even if it was, I would still love this music!  It is brilliant and poignant; a masterpiece of musical experession.  I would definitely recommend this CD to the especially harshest critics of the Dixie Chicks and see if you do not agree with me, that you will be pleasantly surprised by the musical genious that flows from track to track.  It is the kind of CD that you can put in your CD player and not have to skip around to find a good song because every song is enjoyable and this, coming from someone that actually voted for George Bush!  Ha ha!";The best Dixie Chicks Cd yet
779;344.0;4.0;19.0;"Chances are you haven't read thru all 300+ reviews up to this point. Me neither.  But the CD didn't get an overall 4-star review for nothing. The Chicks have always been a band with tight, soaring harmonies and a pop sensibility. You'll find those same attributes here, but with less twang. Country music radio turned its back on the Chicks, so they've returned the favor.\n\nThe album is filled with solid lyrical content (with contributions by Pete Yorn & Sheryl Crow). Yes, there is probably too much referencing the ""I'm-pissed-and-now-I'm-gonna-sing-about-it"" scene, but other songs more than make up for that. All the songs have an emotional resonance, whether addressing relationship issues, Alzheimer's, lost love, or even infertility. Typically, on a CD with 12 to 14 tracks, you'll get 3, maybe 4 solid numbers, a couple second-tier cuts, and a bunch of filler. Not here. I bought this CD yesterday afternoon and have played it 3 times --it's almost all top-shelf stuff.\n\nI'm not a country music fan, just a music fan. My political preferences didn't drive me to the store & buy this CD. It's just good music. And I am one Texan who IS proud that the Dixie Chicks are from the Lone Star state.";Texas proud
782;345.0;5.0;19.0;"I'm loving the new album.  Unlike a lot of artists, they have both hearts and brains.  Disagree with them if you like, but thank God you have the freedom to (still) in this country.  They don't call democracy ""the great experiment"" for nothing.\n\nYou folks with the police-state-USA-democracy-deathwish, wake up.  Clean house at home first, and don't you dare say folks ""hate this country"" because they are using the freedoms paid for by the blood of our families and friends. A great and brave man said, ""Give me liberty or give me death.""  If you are willing to give up your freedoms and rights for a political party and a couple bucks, you don't even know what it means to be a decent American.\n\nGod bless the girls, and God bless America.";God Bless the Girls
806;346.0;1.0;19.0;This is a terrible piece of work and would not suggest it for anyone;Sorry album
812;347.0;5.0;19.0;I've never been a big DC fan, especially their early work where they clearly tried to grab the redneck crowd with such songs as Earl and No Ring and such.  And the lead singer has always struggled to sound as flat as a bowl of grits.\n\nThe best thing that happened to them is to have this dumb redneck country audience turn against them. (Let's see, the only two populations that still feel that stupidity is patriotic is rednecks and rich Republicans...)\n\nTaking the long way has the Dixie Chicks surrounding themselves with music that is a better place for them.  While they won't ever be confused with Lucinda Williams or Shelby Lynn, their niche might well be here among young alt-country fans and mainstream listeners who think Chesney and Reba are scary.(And Brooks and Dunn? Is that really a band?)\n\nThis is their most mature album and clearly shows they can make it without pandering to the Country Music(capital C, capital M)crowd, that the Dixie Chicks were clearly pandering to early in their career.;Their best album
899;348.0;5.0;19.0;Love it love it love it!\n\nBeginning to end, this album proves the chicks are better to hold onto their conviction, rise above the envious green, red-necked down-home country folk and produce an album for real music lovers, fans and those who embrace autonomy--let 'em keep stewing in self-loathing spite and anger! Beautiful!\n\nWhat I love even more is to see one or two jaded reviews surrounded by a sea of appreciation, love and admiration for REAl artists.\n\nFirst three songs kick the CD into overdrive and set the tone for the remaining tracks. The entire album will see plenty of play along the way.\n\nAMEN and GOD BLESS the CHICKS!;Kickin' up another storm
937;349.0;5.0;19.0;"The Dixie Chicks are back with an in-your-face CD that not only comes with what we expect from the Dixie's Chicks, beautiful and melodic vocals, great songs cowritten by themselves and some of their friends such as Sheryl Crow, Chad Smith, John Mayer and Don Wilson.\n\nThis CD is stunningly perfect showing just how beautiful their harmonies can be.  While they never stray really from their country roots, they beautifully combine rock driven back beats with their bluesy country and banjo driven (on a few songs) backgrounds.  Included in this great CD are several rockabilly songs that have a great hidden message that prove these three incredibly talented women aren't hiding behind the huge controversy that was cast on them several years ago.\n\nCheeky and fun with even a gospel flare at the end I highly recommend this CD whether your country, rock, pop or any other music fan.  Even their title, ""Taking The Long Way,"" seems to be a tongue-in-cheek play on the fact that they been off the scene for so long.  The title seems to say, `oh we were just taking a long way home.'  As if they were taking a scenic route, which if you listen to the words of this album they did. - To a better day in every way.  Jaci Rae";Stunningly perfect
939;350.0;5.0;19.0;The songs (lyrics & music) are brillant. The voices pure and strong. Anyone who would review this CD with a low rating are judging politics and not the true talent found within this CD.\n\nGet over it! I have more respect for these artists now than ever before.;Brillant

106;352.0;4.0;18.0;Loved this CD. great melodies, great music. Very enjoyable overall. Never been a fan of the Dixie Chicks. Bought the CD because I was curious as to why the won all those grammys. I know why now.;Nicely Done!
112;353.0;5.0;18.0;The fans have spoken and the Dixie Chicks have received the recognition they deserve for standing up for what they believed in. Whoever said the American citizens' lack of support for thier president meant that they didn't support the troops or their country, was an idiot. Democracy...someone needs to remind those who're still bashing the Chicks, what this word means. After all, isn't that what Bush is apparently occupying Iraq for? Anyway, we owe big congrats to the Chicks for standing up for what they believe in (when so many of us wouldn't), and finding the strength to compose another album in the face of adversary. I commend them on their success at the Grammy's and hope all their future endeavors are as fruitful as those recently have been.\n\nThis is by far their best album to date, and I've been a fan since they were walking on luggage belts.;About Time
116;354.0;5.0;18.0;What a great album....you can't go wrong with anything Dixie Chicks.  They are so unique and their talent is amazing!  Buy it all from albums to dvd's to memorabilia....chicks rock chicks rule!;5 Stars because 6 wasn't available!!!!!
129;355.0;5.0;18.0;"I'm going to make this short and sweet.\n\nI'm sick of seeing these ""reviews"" that don't even discuss the album. Instead they talk about ""the incident"". Tell me, how is your opinion on the Dixie Chicks controversy helpful in the review of this amazing album? You believe that this album is full of Bush-rage, which is far from the truth. One song is directly about the incident. That's right! One song on an album that contains more than a dozen songs! Sure a few more mention the incident, but they aren't centered around it. How one-dimension are your minds- seriously?\nNow on to the album. I'm not going to do a track by track analysis. I'm going to summarize the album in just a word.\n\nIt's damn close to perfection. Yes I said it! The whole album. There's not one bad song. The three girls out did themselves. I don't care if you disagree, the Grammys said it all.\nAnd don't pull ""the public doesn't vote on the Grammys"" card. Of course the public doesn't vote. Specialist in the music industry vote. After all, they're the ones that know good music. If the public voted, not so long ago Britney Spears, NSYNC, and the Spice Girls would've done a Grammy sweep. Wouldn't you have wished that the public didn't vote then?\n\nView the Dixie Chicks as a talented musical group, with an opinion. Everyone has them!";An actual relevant review.
184;356.0;5.0;18.0;"No matter how many times I hear it, ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" sends chills up my spine and puts a tear into my eye. Off the top of my head, I cannot think of a more powerful song. This CD has heart, soul, anger and politics all rolled into a musical package that sometimes sounds more like ""Rumours""-era Fleetwood Mac than anything country. But make no mistake, the fact that it is a country record is what gives this CD even more legs. It's been said that the best music is made during periods of Republican leadership. Look no further than this CD to see the truth of that statement. Not ready to make nice, indeed.\n\nAnd see the movie!";Sing and DON'T shut up
212;357.0;1.0;18.0;The Dixie Chicks are selling this album at a deep discount and are cancelling concerts across America.  There is a reason: they're offering nothing new.  More of the same.  They haven't grown, and the act has gotten old.;Not much new
222;358.0;5.0;18.0;"I have been a fan of the chicks since their album ""Wide Open Spaces"" I must say they improve with each album they make. ""Taking the Long Way"" is one of my favorite albums to be released this year. This album does not settle on one musical style.  This in part, makes it even more enjoyable.  The album has everything from country, pop, and rock. The chicks pull off each of them!  Their lyrics have matured and their harmonies are in tip top shape.  I enjoy every song on this album. Hurry and go grab your copy today!!!!!!";Great From Start to Finish!!!!!!
256;359.0;5.0;18.0;I just bought Taking The long way and I must say it is Great. The more I listen to it the more I love it.  It's a wonderful blend of country music with a touch of rock.  I have always loved and ejoyed the Dixie Chicks and this CD just leaves me to say, They did it again.  Another great CD from the Dixie Chicks.  :);They did it again with Taking The long way.
283;360.0;5.0;18.0;"Just saw the chicks in Pittsburgh, last weekend. Incredible show. They certainly did the cd justice. They are great performers. The band is superb. I don't want to give it away, but their entrance was a hoot. Natalie came out blazing, too, rocking out on ""Lubbock or Leave It"". Three or four songs in, the whole arena went dark and out of the darkness came that initial strum that begins ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and the darkened arena went wild. It was so amazing.... A light came up on Natalie, and she, richly and fiercely, slammed it home. Needless to say the whole arena was on its feet. And in case any of you were wondering, the place was packed to the gills. The only seats open were way at the far end up high in nose bleed territory.\nTo the person who unfurled a huge white sheet/banner just to the left of the stage for the whole world to see, proclaiming how they had always believed in and never stopped believing in the chicks. We all saw it. I got teary for a sec. Kudos to you!\nIf you don't have tickets, get them. For the daily fix until then, this cd is the absolute answer.";Incredible cd..... incredible concert
305;361.0;5.0;18.0;This is an amazing CD. A phenomenal display of The Dixie Chicks talent and range, with enough variety that I can listen to it over and over again. The first four songs on the CD are among their best. They have really come into their own as songwriters on this one.\n\n Now if you are prone to stick a dip of snuff between your cheek and gum while scratching your privates and listening to Toby Keith you probably won't like this.;Long Live the Chicks!
362;362.0;5.0;18.0;Proof that you can speak out with courage and still write amazing love songs. Lullaby just breaks my heart. They all do. I love the sentiments in I Hope and Not Ready to Make Nice. I love the love songs of Everybody Knows and Easy Silence and Lullaby. This is an album to dance to, to love to, to find some courage from. It's great.\n\nShame on the country stations that stopped playing the best music around.\n\nPS--If people like this album, I bet they'd also love those of\n\nAustin's treasure, Eliza Gilkyson\n\nPaul Loeb\n\nAuthor Soul of a Citizen;It's a stunning album--touches your heart and soul
383;363.0;5.0;18.0;"WOW! After I heard this CD I actually had to run to the bathroom to go #1 I was so exited! Like, the Dixie Chicks are singing about themselves and how they were treated really bad and stuff (even if they are really super rich) and I've never heard an album that had better music than this (except maybe Barefoot Jerry's ""You Can't Get Off with Your Shoes On"").  And, like, just because the Dixie Chicks apologized and said they didn't mean what they said after the Bush thing and are changing their minds again and saying they meant it the first time, that doesn't mean they ever backed down, right?  You can keep changing your mind and hopping from side to side and still claim to be sticking up for what you believe in, right? And as far as Natalie Maines saying she is against patriotism, you can still be a real American patriot and be against patriotism all at once, right?  I think I'm against patriotism too, now, if she is, but I think I am still a patriotic American.  And it's, like, censorship if people stop listening to the Dixie Chicks, but it's different when liberals ban politically incorrect speech on campus, or ban the Confederate flag, or ban sports teams with Native American names, or boycott conservative radio talk show advertisers.  That's, like, different because it is only censorship when the stuff being banned is stuff that doesn't bother us, like burning the American flag.  Don't waive the Confederate flag but burn the American one!  Actually this review is giving me a headache thinking about this stuff.  Thinking is hard. I'm going to get an aspirin.";THE BEST CD OF ALL TIME!!!
400;364.0;5.0;18.0;"This was my first ""Dixie Chicks"" CD that I puirchased based on that I liked their attitude by sticking to their convictions.

Don't listen to the negative press buy this CD and go see these ladies on tour.";My first Dixie Chicks CD (WoW)
424;365.0;5.0;18.0;"I bought this recording as a political statement; to validate the right of the Dixie Chicks (and all of us)to express personal views, regardless of the popularity of said opinions.\n\nI was delighted to find that the songs are by turn catchy, evocative, rebellious, and consistently melodious, sing-able, offerings. Add to that the fact that the lyrics are clearly, cleanly pronounced, and I find myself playing this cd far more often than I would have guessed.";Pleasant surprise
443;366.0;1.0;18.0;The Chicks should sing and get out of politics. This whole album is geared to making a statement. Shut up and sing girls!! We don't care about your opinions.;Really bad album

546;369.0;5.0;18.0;"For some reason, I find the Dixie Chicks to be absolutely perfect music for my daily 10K Concept II Ergometer rowing workouts at the local YMCA.  If anything, this is their best album of exercise music to date.\n\nAlthough the price at Amazon is excellent, for an additional $5 you can buy it at Walmart, where they seem uneasy about selling this ""controversial"" product, and really stick it to them.";Another great album of exercise music
551;370.0;5.0;18.0;One quality song after another, sung with feeling.  The Dixie Chicks take us on a journey through their lives and leave us feeling richer for the experience.

571;371.0;5.0;18.0;"It has been a while, but the Dixie Chicks do not disappoint with ""Taking the Long Way.""  They are amazingly talented and perform with a richness and style rarely heard in today's music. I would highly recommend this album; it is a real joy to listen to.";Worth the Wait
579;372.0;5.0;18.0;The more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.  Unlike other albums, each song is distinctive and powerful.  I love tracks 3 and 14!  It is a little country, rock, spiritual, jazz and blues.  Enjoy!;Love it!
602;373.0;5.0;18.0;"Just like with ""Home"" the first time I listened to this CD I classified it as good, but with each subsequent listen I love the album more and more. Personally I love their sound and was won over by Natalie's distinctive vocals long ago. I like every track on the album, though ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", ""Taking the Long Way"" and ""Voice Inside My Head"" are my personal favorites.\n\nI'm not a strict country fan so it doesn't bother me that the Chicks have moved outside the realm of pure country (not that they've ever truly fit in there, anyway). But for those looking for a strictly country album, this isn't it. However, I think anyone who has been a fan of the Dixie Chicks, and not just a fan of the genre, will enjoy this CD.

How sad and pathetic that some people cannot seem to let go of their anger.\n\nIt is very ironic that certain very popular rap artists such as Eminem can go out and get arrested, rap about raping and beating women, and brag about using dope; yet still find a rabid following and get played on the radio.

The earlier ""Wide Open Spaces"" spoke to me as well.\n\n""Home"" and it's live concert DVD were purchased by ME on the first day available. So, it was with serious anticipation that I bought the new album, especially since one of the greats, Rick Rubin, was producing. It certainly doesn't dissapoint. After reading Rubin was after more of a rock sound, I hoped they wouldn't change too much. I was pleased that this record is simply closer in feel to the first two, than the still excellent acoustic ""Home"". My favorite track is ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", (which I think is a response to haters), followed closely by the beautiful ""Easy Silence"".

728;379.0;5.0;18.0;Destined to be one of the biggest selling (and most celebrated) albums of 2006, Taking the Long Way shows exactly why Natalie, Martie and Emily are a tour de force. Powerful, poetic lyrics mixed with Natalie's towering lead vocal and the sisters' rich harmonies. With the help of the brilliant Rick Rubin, the chicks have created an album that will entice music lovers across a number of genres (including country). California rock, country, folk, blues, pop... this album's got it all! While I absolutely LOVE the up-tempo numbers like The Long Way Around, Not Ready To Make Nice, I Like It, and Lubbock Or Leave It, it's the gentler songs like Easy Silence, Silent House (which made me cry, because like Natalie's grandmother, mine also suffered from dementia) and the breathtakingly gorgeous Lullaby (seriously, it's a slice of heaven) that stir my emotions. Perhaps it's just me, but I can't help but feel that Natalie has grown vocally since the last album (2002's Home - another excellent album, by the way). Her voice is more passionate and controlled than ever before. This album took 2 years to make, and boy was it worth the wait! It's a carefully crafted work of art. It just rocks - plain and simple!;Best girl group... EVER!
775;380.0;4.0;18.0;"A more sober and mature sounding album and that is to be expected from the Chicks. What happened to them three years ago will make anyone grow up a little bit faster, even though the Chicks started down this road with their last studio cd ""Home"". In this review, I will only discuss my favorite songs and what the songs mean to me.\n\nThe album begins with the song, 'The Long Way Around' and it pretty much tells the story how the Chicks had dreams and decided to go after their dreams, instead of doing what their friends did. The next song, 'Easy Silence' is a moving tribute to their husbands and how they protected the Chicks when their world turned upside down. 'Lubbock or Leave It' is a song that mocks those who insists they are going to hell because they don't follow their agenda or share their perspective of religion. 'Bitter End' is a song that is probably about the many friends and fans the Chicks have lost because of their beliefs. And finally, 'I Hope' is a song about peace and women abuse.\n\nRick Rubin did a good job producing this cd, although it is slower compared to their last cds. And the Chicks take more control writing, playing and singing their songs. I am glad to see the Chicks still making music and how ironic they have returned to a different political climate.";A Sober and Mature Album

True Rock n roll with a nice sip of country so discrete you can enjoy it so much..Country or Rock Fan.\n\nHighlights like the ""Voice Inside My Head"" trully speaks of the evolution of these once crazy gals that gave us songs like ""Sin Wagon"" into a much mature work that show us that good music still sounds once in a while.";So far from Home
801;382.0;5.0;18.0;"I am old enough to be Nataline Maines' mother, but I can honestly say that she is my newest hero, and I want to be just like her when I grow up. The songs on the Dixie Chicks' new CD, penned by all the Chicks and forcefully interpreted by lead singer Maines, achieve an emotional maturity and depth that other writers and performers of country rock can only wish for.\n\nThe title song, ""Taking the Long Way Around,"" says it all. Perpetual teenagers look for shortcuts to adulthood and cave in to pressure in all its forms, peer and otherwise, while real adults choose the long, hard way to personal freedom and integrity. They courageously take on a world where only skilled a** kissers are welcome, and all others need not apply. When Maines sings, ""No, I / I could never follow,"" I find myself thanking this free country's lucky stars that she never could.";The Long Way is the Best Way
811;383.0;5.0;18.0;"As I type this review ""Taking the Long Way Home"" has been the #1 CD at Amazon all week.  Despite all the efforts to persecuted the Dixie Chicks and corporate radio's refusal to play them (a disconnect because obviously this is music people want to hear otherwise it would not be selling).  People who are not buying the CD because of the lack of airplay are obviously missing some great music.\n\nObviously, all those people giving negative reviews of the CD are being motivated more by political bias than by what is really on the CD.";Believe the Hype!
865;384.0;2.0;18.0;"The bubble-headed bimbos in this band have been acting like the worst of politicians: They apologized for dissing W when he was popular, and now, looking at his poll numbers fall, they are flip-flopping and trying to retract that apology.\n\nWith this CD, the Ditzy Chicks are shifting their sound from country to pop.  As you can see from the CD cover photo, they are trying to drop the rural, country girl image in favor of a new urbane one. (And even their most ardent of fans will have to admit, looking at the CD cover photo, that all three have got the most vacuous ""the lights are on upstairs but nobody's home"" look in their eyes.)\n\nThe real problem is with the music: The songs on this CD range from mediocre to awful. And some of the lyrics are so bad as to be unintentionally funny.\n\nSomeone should explain to these poor things that protest songs are supposed to be about injustices to the people - not injustices to the band members!";Ditzy Chicks
879;385.0;5.0;18.0;WOW!!! This is a GREAT CD!!  I would LOVE to see 'Not Ready to Make Nice' performed at the Grammy's or the AMA's. :)  You can really tell in this album just how much they have grown as a group and as individuals.;Welcome Back!!!!
884;386.0;3.0;18.0;I like country music and I am glad the Dixie Chicks put out a new album. First the standouts, Lubbock or Leave It, Lullaby, Not Ready to Make Nice and Taking the Long Way Round,--all play nicely with rhythm and use the Chicks ability to harmonize well. The words are clever without being jaded or insincere. The other songs on first listening seem to run together--lots of Natalie Maines singing up and down the scale without much punch. If you are a fan of Sheryl Crowe or Kelly Clarkson and don't mind a tiny bit of banjo playing ( I could have used a lot more) than you will enjoy this album.;Some standouts with filler thrown in
888;387.0;5.0;18.0;"I love the Dixie Chicks! They are gals with guts, class and talent!\n\n""Not Ready to Make Nice"" says it all in this time of darkness. I'm glad they came out with this!";Nothing less than gutsy!
892;388.0;3.0;18.0;I like the cd and I admit it wasn't as peppy as the other Dixie Chick cds I have. It is good though, just not awesome. It talks to any loss situation- break-up, divorce, death of a love one. The emotion expressed on several of the songs reminded me of when I was going through my divorce. Like any of those situations, you have to work through the bad to get to the good on other side and thrive again. So this album may not be real peppy, but that does not mean that it doesn't have its own merit or that the next one won't be peppier.\n\nAs for the political stuff, get over it. That's the whole point of being Americans, we all have the right given to us by the U.S. Constitution to express our opinions and exercise our own beliefs. I come from a military family and as they point out the military is a voluntary military and Eisenhower was already warning us about the Military-Industrial Complex as early as 1961. We just seeing it first hand in full living color these days.\n\nMost importantly, if you are not going to buy the album, haven't bought the album, or even listened to the album, don't post a review. This isn't a vent, go find a friend or contact your local country radio station's morning talk show. It is not appropriate here.\n\nBack to the cd, I bought 3 copies for friends & family and have enjoyed it, though I admit I would like some more peppy songs on the next cd. Good luck Chicks.;Like going through a divorce, have to go through the bad to get to the good on the other side
903;389.0;5.0;18.0;This new CD was well worth the wait. The Chicks are back sounding as great as ever. I am so proud to see strong women standing up for what they believe in. Thank god somebody does these days!;Finally!
906;390.0;5.0;18.0;I bought the album to show our moron-in-chief that many of us WILL support artists who speak out against his idiocy and lies.  What a pleasant surprise that my purchase was not only a political statement, but also a great musical find.  These Chicks are the best.  Love their sound.  Their songs are upbeat and addictive, and a nice change from the emo and alternative rock I have been fixated on as of late.  Can't wait to explore their older music.\n\nYou keep socking it to that rat in the White House, ladies!;These chicks rock!
912;391.0;5.0;18.0;"God bless the Chicks for saying what they think, singing songs about meaningful feelings and events, and for finding a way to express all of the ups and downs life brings with grace, spunk, sass and talent. They are immensely talented and this album shows it. I am so constantly won over by them, ""Taking the Long Way"" only proves that i was right to fall in love with them when i was 22 and living 1200 miles from home in a small town in Texas. 10 years later, they never fail to move me.\n\nTHANK YOU CHICKS!! Thank you for saying whatever the heck you want, thank you for two years later BEING RIGHT and thank you for sharing your music with us. For that, we are all the better.";Incredible talent!
916;392.0;5.0;18.0;There is just something about the Chicks. I can listen to any song they sing and fall in love with it!! They are so incredibly talented!! Way to go ladies!! You did it again!!\n\nThank you for standing up for what you believe in!!;AWESOME!! YEAH They are finally back!
944;393.0;5.0;18.0;"First, it is sad how blown out of proportion ""the incident"" was.  Isn't it funny how bad the truth hurts sometimes!\n\nSecond, I can not believe that Reba would stoop so low.  I thought she had more class than that.\n\nFinally, to the topic at hand . . . Taking the Long Way . . . THE MOST AWESOME CD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!  I LOVE the Chicks and play all of their CD's on a daily basis.  I thought their previous CD's could not be topped, but this takes the prize.  I had tears in my eyes listening to it!!  If I had to pick my favorite today, it would be song #1, Taking the Long Way.  A foot tapping beat with unforgettable lyrics.  A great song to start the CD.  All songs on this CD are top notch.  Another favorite is ""I Hope"".  What a way to end the CD.  This song should be the theme song for America!  Listen to what it is saying.  We can only hope that some people in society will just live their lives to the fullest and quite worrying about everyone else! You can feel the passion in every song.  This is a must purchase CD.  In my opinion, radio stations need to wake up!  This music needs to be played for all to hear!\n\nBACK THE DIXIE CHICKS!  BUY THIS CD!";DIXIE CHICKS ARE BACK!!!!!!!!
977;394.0;5.0;18.0;The Chicks are back with their long awaited album. All I have to say is...WoW!!! Its just so amazing. The vocals, the lyrics, the harmonies, the instruments, the music...its just to much to say to try to describe this album!!! Well I have just heard this album 7 times and I can not put it down and I know you wouldnt either because this is the best of best. Whether you like the funky type like I like it, the slow lullaby, or the lyric bound sounds of not ready to make nice. This album is for anyone willing to give it a true listen and be in awe of this cds emotions and truth. Here are my ratings on the songs:\n\nTaking the long way: 10/5. One of my favs. Very autobiographical.\n\nEasy Silence- 5/5\n\nNot Ready to make nice-10/5. Their 1st single and another fav of mines because of deep lyrics.\n\nEverybody knows- 5/5\n\nbitter end-10/5. Another fav. The harmonies of this song just outdues it all.\n\nLullaby-100000/5. All I have to say if no one likes this song they seriously need to check themselves. lol its just that great.\n\nLubbock or leave it-10/5. Love the attitude and courage the girls had with this song.\n\nSilent House- 10/5. This is a deep topic to talk about to me and the song is just perfect to me.\n\nFavorite Year- 10/5. Love the music and words of this song.\n\nVoice inside my head-10/5. A very deep topic either about abortion/adoption, but I really think it is towards adoption, but we will never know till the chicks confirm.\n\nI like it- 10/5. Very funky and something you could dance to.\n\nBaby hold on- 10-/5. Gosh you will fall in love with this song the first time you hear it. The pleading of natalies voice is just to much to handle for me.\n\nSo hard-10/5. Love the topic of this song. The Chicks outdue themselves with this one.\n\nI Hope-10000/5. Can anymore be said? Its the best I have ever heard in my life. This is the ideal way people want life to be for themselves and for everyone else and the Chicks just had the guts to say it for us all.\n\nAll in all this album is an answer to all my prayers. Its just the true meaning of what music should be. There are no flaws and you will truly enjoy every second of a journey the chicks lead us through. Thank you Chicks and thank you everyone for reading this. Now go out there and buy it :D;The Best of the Best!!!
981;395.0;5.0;18.0;I have never been more proud to call myself a fan of anybody's music before. The are TRUE artists. They say what they believe in and they don't sell out to satisfy the rednecks. Any time you turn on country radio there is some white guy in a cowboy hat who sounds exactly the same as the guy who came on before him and they're both singing about the same exact thing. Country music is trash these days. The Dixie Chicks go against the grain. They make music they believe in and that is what makes them special. I love and respect them for basically giving all the red states the finger. The Chicks are true Americans. The people who burned their CDs aren't.;A PROUD Chicks Fan!
987;396.0;5.0;18.0;The new album is great and the DCX's don't diasppoint!!!  The Long Way, Voice inside My Head, Lullaby, Silent House, Bitter End and Easy Silence are my favorites.  The only song I don't care for is the one co-written with Sheryl Crow.  Otherwise, the album is  a real gem.  Admittedly, it is a departure from their earlier works but if you go back and really listen to their earlier CD's (even prior Natalie) you can really tell how much they have grown as artists, musicians, and people.  Home is still my favorite CD, but that is like saying an emerald is better than a ruby--it is all a matter of personal preference.;It's been way too long, but the girls are back in top form!!!
1003;397.0;5.0;18.0;I just love this album. The Dixie Chicks are the only band in history that I own all their stuff. Also, they are the only CDs I can put in and listen to without skipping any songs. This CD is no different. Every song is great and I am so proud to be from the same state as these heros!!!\n\n  Any reviews less than 4 stars are obviously not about the music and based on other factors because these ladies are awsome!!!;Perfection... Again
102;398.0;5.0;17.0;"I wasn't a Dixie Chicks fan because I never really listened to Country radio (not a problem for finding the Dixie Chicks these days).  But I saw Shut up and Sing, the documentary of their three year recovery and transformation after the brou-ha-ha over lead singer, Natalie Maines, comments about Bush while on tour in England.  When I heard their music on the movie, I came to buy the CD, and I was surprised at how accessible this album is for non-country fans.\n\nI'm a big fan of Sheryl Crow, Alison Kraus, Jewel--singer/songwriting women who play guitars.  Though this album of the Dixie Chicks has only one song penned by Crow, you would swear that they are channeling her (and she's been channeling George Harrison lately) on songs 8-12.  In fact, you can hear a bit of George Harrison in places too--just like Crow's Wildflower, which I found this album a nice companion to.  ""I Like It"" sounds a lot like Crow when she's being the wild child: Soak Up the Sun, Everyday is a Winding Road, All I wanna Do.  ""My Favorite Year"" is actually the song Crow wrote on this, and yeah, you can hear the Crow influence, but I think she was an influential figure here on the rest too.  Course, I've never encountered Dixie Chicks' music before, so perhaps Crow is channeling them!\n\nThe first half of the album deals more with their response to the shakedown of their careers as musicians.  They are powerful songs, and could easily--even ""Not Ready to Make Nice""--outlast the incidents that caused them.  They are anthems in their own right, and this album deserves a lot of play for years to come, after the documentary is a historical artifact.  The album will be about transformation and gritty success through troubled times.\n\nNatalie has a strong high voice and it embodies the struggle so well--she's perfect for this music.  I like the quiet songs too ""Lullaby"" and ""Easy Silence"".  I like that Easy Silence comes in between the anthem songs; I love that ""Taking the Long Way around"" comes first.  It's a well-planned CD, with the Chicks making some unusual and daring musical choices through the last few songs.  I'm a new fan, and I can't wait to see what they do next.";Not your typical country fare and a great driving CD
108;399.0;5.0;17.0;So not every song caught my attention, but the songs that did warrant at least 5 stars each.  When they do their thing, the Chicks are at the head of the playing field.  Natalie's voice is really doing some gorgeous things these days.  I've never heard her sound so good.\n\nTaking the Long Way is an upbeat celebration of going against the grain.  Easy Silence is just beautiful, and listening to it immediately takes me to a calmer place.  Not Ready to Make Nice isn't the easiest song to hear, but I can't stop listening to it because of the passion and pain behind it.  It really says a lot about in a few short lines about how easy (and baffling) it is for people to lose it when someone dares to say something they don't like.  Silent House is haunting and beautiful.  The harmonies and the heartbreaking instrumentals serve to make it possibly the best song on the CD.  There are other songs I like, but those four jump out at me as the best.\n\nFor those who are still (still!) angry that Natalie spoke her mind, please think about the times you've said something someone didn't like and how it would have made you feel to be ostracized, threatened, and blacklisted to the extent that these three women and their families were.  How dark can the human soul get?  I'll bet these ladies have a pretty good idea, and that is a terrible shame.;Some true greatness here
125;400.0;5.0;17.0;Their talent was not lying dormant during their forced time away from the public eye (and ears!) -- it was amassing for this beautiful resurgence.  Hooray, girls.  Give us more.  You deserved every Grammy you received.;Dixie Triumph
135;401.0;5.0;17.0;"Of course you need to have this album, which has the definitive statement for anyone, man or woman, who has ever stood up for themselves...""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the ""I Will Survive"" of this radio-censored generation.\n\nJust have to tell you that after you buy this album, you must also have the previous Dixie Chicks album HOME, a bluegrass acoustic record that includes their version of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide."" This album is one of the most beautiful things ever recorded.";AN AMERICAN CLASSIC
205;402.0;5.0;17.0;The album is great!  I'm not familiar with much of their earlier music.  I only really became interested when they were criticized for voicing their opinion.  No one has a right to tell them to shut up and sing!  This album speaks to me, speaks of my upbringing in the south.  The unwarranted criticism made them more aware of the contrasts between what we are told God and country mean and the warped ideas that people try to foist onto us in the name of God and country. The music speaks to truth.  You go girls!;The Dixie Chicks come of age.
207;403.0;5.0;17.0;"As a father of an American girl, all I can say is ""thank you.""  These girls rock.  The attitude that is so blatant in the lyrics of the debut track is dripping from every note played on this album.  This is the attitude I want my girl to have when she has to stand up to adversity.";Let the music do the talking
215;404.0;5.0;17.0;"This album deserves credit and acclaim for its musical creativity, the beautiful voices/harmonies, and lyrics that will make you laugh, bawl, remember and, most important, find the energy to keep on trying at this thing we call life. In my book, those three factors come together in a powerful piece of sonic perfomance art.\n\n""Taking the Long Way"" embraces listeners on several levels, the first being the appeal of the Chicks' musical talent and their compelling harmony.  Maines has an authentic ""everywoman"" quality to her voice -- it's alternately soft, sassy and bellowing, depending on the emotion the song is trying to evoke.  Songs that need a lilting, loving touch get it, such as the gentle ""Lullaby"" that any mom will find herself humming during bath time with the baby. Songs evoking images of past loves, a mother's battle with Alzeheimer's, and a couple's desire to keep a committed love young and playful through early parenthood are conveyed with a poignant wish.\n\nThe musicality piques the listeners' interest. The lyrics reach out and grab their hearts. Full disclosure: I'm a 35-year-old (soon to be 36) married mother of two small children. The words to these songs resonate with any woman who has a few bruises on her heart and a lot going on in her life, both family and professional.  Every song has a message a mom, wife, girlfriend, daughter can identify with if they've lived more than a few years and have the scars to prove it.  The songs that have an edge of anger to them resonate also, again in an authentic way.  Any woman (person for that matter) who doesn't have episodes in their life that they're bitterly, deeply angry and hurt over either has been sheltered to the point of being cloistered or is oblivious to the undercurrents in life. Anger and disappointment are part of life, just as much as the other themes in ""Taking the Long Way.""\n\nThose themes -- ranging from politics and love to getting old and growing up -- are what strike me as giving this album a mellowed maturity that makes me listen to it over and over and over... These women have done some living and learning, just like the majority of us.";A powerful song collection
223;405.0;5.0;17.0;I'm not usually one to write a review on the internet, let alone Amazon.com, but I had to comment on this CD.  I will preface it by saying that I wasn't a fan of the Chicks since day one.  I picked up their second CD ('Fly') on a whim and loved their lyrical harmonies.  I tagged along with them again with 'Home,' which I wasn't so impressed with.  After picking up 'Home,' I finally purchased 'Wide Open Spaces,' their mega-hit breakout CD.\n\nWith Taking the Long Way, I had expected a typical Chicks outing - complete with harmonies and rock-like country.  They blew me away with this one.  I will admit that I don't necessarily agree with their political reviews, but I also believe they have a right to their own opinions.  Some of the songs focus too heavily on Natalie's comments two years ago, but I forget about the lyrics and focus on the amazing heartfelt music.  'Silent House' is one of my favorite songs on the CD, but I absolutely love 'The Long Way Around.'\n\nThe CD was so great, I decided to fork over money for concert tickets.  Talk about a great concert -- the Chicks scored again.\n\nAn amazing CD to add to any collection and a great addition to my iPod as well.;Amazing Musical Endeavor
229;406.0;5.0;17.0;"It has always been about the music, not the politics.  I was a fan before the ""comments"" and still am.  Many of the songs center on the experience they had regarding public backlash but even if you did not know the source of inspiration for the music it stands on its own.  The vocals are better than ever and the lyrics strike a nerve in anyone ever rejected or quitely retreating from the world for a time only to come back stronger.\n\nStronger they are.  Sing your hearts out.  This album is great!";My Favorite Chicks Yet!
234;407.0;5.0;17.0;Excellent album, contrary to the lunatic from Charlotte.;Get a life and a clue, Lena.
245;408.0;5.0;17.0;The songs are raw and full of emotion. A few tracks implicitly or explicitly(Not Ready to Make Nice)refer to DXC's heat for the anti-W comments. Others are soft and melodious (Lullaby). Sheryl Crow lent a writing hand on Favorite Year and the guitar and vocals have that bluesy rock feel. Overall I love it to mellow out or when I walk on the treadmill on an incline.;Personal & Perfect!
247;409.0;5.0;17.0;"The Dixie Chicks have told off their critics in this album. Their song ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" builds on all their country roots and takes it to new highs.  Amazing arrangement going from a soft growl to a roar and back. The album is worth getting for this cut alone but the rest of the tracks are equal in weight. The arrangements are dense and interesting, the emotion shines through on every track, and anyone who knows the story of how Clear Channel set out to destroy their livlihoods will cheer them on.\n\nIt is not all about their trials and tribulations, they end with an anthem of hope and they fill in the nooks and crannies with heartfelt ballads.\n\nI cannot recommend this album highly enough.  I gave away my first copy and ordered it again.  Listen to any track on it and you will be sold.";Revenge as Art
255;410.0;3.0;17.0;"There was much about this album that suggested it should be a huge statement artistically: participation of Rick Rubin as producer (involved in Johnny Cash's renaissance and some great albums from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Beastie Boys), interesting songwriting guests (people like Semisonic's Dan Wilson, the Jayhawks' Gary Louris, Neil Finn, the Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell and singer-songwriter Pete Yorn), and hoopla about this album being ""personal"". It is with regret as someone who counts himself a Chicks fan that I have to say, in the words of Public Enemy, ""Don't Believe the Hype"".\n\nA lot of these songs have to deal with the backlash created by statements lead singer Natalie Maines made in 2003 about her embarrassment with the President which led to country radio banning her music with many stations holding events not unlike the ""Beatles burnings"" in the South of the 60s. Sometimes the writing is sharp and incisive as in the chart-topping screw-you anthem ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" (""It's too late to make it right/I probably wouldn't if I could/Cuz I'm mad as h**l/Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should"") But others do tend to drift a bit toward self-pity as in the ""Everybody Knows"" lament of celebrity status. (""All the things I can't erase from my life/Everybody knows"")\n\nAnother problem is a couple songs come off as retreads. ""Lubbock or Leave it"" is a redo of ""Sin Wagon"" from older album FLY and likewise the title track just seems like a slight re-spin on ""Wide Open Spaces"" from the group's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/major-label-debut/dp/B000002BZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">major label debut</a>.\n\nMuch has been made by many reviewers here about the Chicks abandoning country for pop, but I don't hear anything all THAT drastic. There's nothing here that flirts with bluegrass but that's probably the biggest change. There are some tracks that have a light rock feel (no screaming guitars, more like late period Bonnie Raitt or Sheryl Crow), 1 that's a nod to 60s girl pop, and 1 'secular' gospel tune (closer ""I Hope"").\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n""Not Ready to Make Nice"" probably stands tallest here, a brilliantly defiant middle finger at the country music establishment as the Chicks have their say about the ""incident"". It avoids self-pitying precisely because it doesn't focus on which side is ""right"" or ""wrong"" so much as the group's feelings about it all.(""And how in the world can the words that I said/Send somebody so over the edge/That they'd write me a letter/Sayin' that I better/shut up and sing/or my life will be over..."") I say this as someone who considers himself a pretty mainstream conservative: we have seen ourselves come dangerously close to doing the things that caused us to break from England lo these many years ago. The delicate ""Lullaby"" is a great soother Natalie and the group penned in tribute to their new offspring (""How long do you want to be loved?/Is forever enough? Is forever enough?"")\n\nLOWS:\nThe two worst offenders probably are the earlier mentioned title track and ""Everybody Knows"" but I'd also say slightly 60s girl group influenced ""I Like It"" is fairly blah as well.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nDixie Chicks diehards should get this one regardless of their politics. Those who aren't already ""in the fold"" probably won't be joining because it's short several blockbuster tracks like ""Goodbye Earl"" and ""Wide Open Spaces"". The group's best effort is still&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FLY/dp/B00000K29H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FLY</a>.\n\nEDIT:\nRecently watched the documentary ""Shut Up and Sing"" (about the controversy that spawned the song ""Not Ready to Make Nice"") and found myself liking the songs more than I recall. I'll plan to give this another listen in case I've judged this a tad too harshly. I'm thinking it might pick up another 1/2 star.";Overhyped...average Chicks effort
258;411.0;5.0;17.0;One of the best albums of the year for those who like mainstream\n\nand country with a little bit of edge. Great harmonics with a little more grown-up thoughtfulness, which never hurts. Like the banjo and violin flourishes a lot. A good companion to Fly and Wide Open Spaces. And, they do have W's number and aren't afraid to say so. I like their courage to stand up for each other. We could all use more of that.;no swift boatin'  the chicks
314;412.0;5.0;17.0;My first and likely only review on this site: This CD is something very special. I have listened to the Dixie Chicks from the beginning, always a fan, but the enjoyment I got from their CDs diminished over the years. However, after all the figthing and controversy, after hearing about this CD, I knew I had to buy it - and it is worth every penny.\n\nThe songs flow beautifully, and as one reviewer already said, you can listen to the whole CD without ever hitting the skip button.\n\nI deeply appreciate and enjoy (and sympathize with) the anti-Bush, anti-war and simply anti-violence message of many of the songs, but it's in the other tracks like Easy Silence, Silent House and Lullaby that the best stuff happens.\n\nThe guests like John Mayer and Keb Mo make the whole experience even better.;Worth it
340;413.0;2.0;17.0;"I'm a big dixie chicks fan despite Natalie's attempt to mix politics with entertainment.  I even enjoyed the pre Natalie Dixie Chicks. But I won't stay a fan long if the albums are as dry as this one. The part I like most about the chicks seemed to have fallen by the wayside. There weren't any toe tapping, sing-a-long songs. I didn't like the remake of ""mississippi"" I thought the original played during the Rock The Vote concert was better. I understand the Dixie chicks had some important things to say here but I feel there could be a more positive way to do it. Sorry girls, still waiting for a good come back.";where's the spunk?
375;414.0;5.0;17.0;"Ok, I confess, I've enjoyed the Dixie Chicks, but, I bought this CD, the day it was released, as a political statement.\n\nI have to say, I was Appalled, when they made a simple joke, (something like ""don't blame me, I didn't vote for him"")while in Europe, about the current president of the ""land of the free"" and ""his people"" were so thin-skinned that the actual administration rose up in hew-and-cry calling the ""Chicks"" un-American and anti-American and other nasty stuff.\n\nThey ranted enough, they stirred up the haters among their following to the degree the girls got death threats ... for a simple comment about disagreeing with Mr. G W Bush!\n\nAnd got Screams from the administration, demanding people boycott their album, since, obviously, anyone who says they disagree with GW ...\n\nWell... I disagree that view and definitely disagree with an administration taking that kind of a stance ... so the minute I saw they were ""taking the risk"" of releasing a new CD ... I bought it ... (and I hope you will, too) as a statement of support for free speech, really.\n\nBoy, did I luck out ... not every protest is so tasty! The CD is a sweet addition to my music library ... the ""Chicks"" are at their best ... love the songs and the thoughts in them.\n\nSo, if you happen to agree with everything the current administration says and does ... buy the CD for the music!\n\nIf you happen to agree that free speech should be supported...buy the CD for the statement ... and luck out with great music.\n\nJust my thoughts ... your mileage may vary ... some exceptions apply ... and if this would land me on the ""with no explanation 'no fly' list"" ... I was just kidding, obviously";Make a political statement ... and end up with an excellent CD
415;415.0;5.0;17.0;"I've been a long term Dixie Chicks fan - since their days as a foursome doing cowgirl music on the roadhouse tours. For those who have followed their entire career, this CD should not be the shocker that the media portrays it to be. The Chicks are doing what all of the best artists do  - they are growing and pushing the edge of their artistic creativity.  That they have done so successfully in the washing machine of national political debate is all the more testament to their abilities. Anyone who won't buy the CD because they're still mad about the Natalie's comments about ""W"" is missing out - not only on great music - but on the lesson that the Chicks can teach you about who we are as Americans. My only negative view of this CD is that their shift in musical genre doesn't showcase Martie and Emily's instrumental talents as much as one might like. Martie gets a little more play - but Emily's multi-instrument capabilities are not nearly as present. Still - its a tremendously courageous CD and its a must buy - as a Chick's fan - and as an American looking to find truth in an era when truth is either for sale or for hiding.";High Kicks for Chicks

486;417.0;5.0;17.0;I never listened to country or bluegrass much before but since the Dixie Chicks showed up I am a convert.  Bravo!  for your talent, your words, and your bravery.\n\nGodspeed!;Best yet!

541;419.0;5.0;17.0;The newest release from the very very talented Chicks is arguably their best. Emerging from a major blow to their reputation, they knock down all doors and walls in their way. They let it be known that they are content with themselves and they are not willing to back down just to appease their audience-- they would rather be true to themselves than kiss anyone's feet. They wrote or co-wrote each of the songs on the album and you can really tell with the love and strength that comes through their voices. The songs stay in your head all day and you can't wait to get back into your car so you can blast their songs on your way home. Best release yet, Chicks.;Dixie Kicks
542;420.0;5.0;17.0;I love these chicks! I agree with everything they say. Their courage to speak out against Dubya has really helped me in my life, like stand up to my mean boss and demand what I want out of the company. It really liberated me. They showed me that all those people who don't agree with me can go to you know where. I'm so sick and tired and hate being bullied around by the far right. I've come to the conclusion that all conservatives are racists, just like the single N.R.T.M.N talks about. They do teach their daughters to hate people they've never met. I see it everyday around me. There needs to be more women like the chicks around who show little girls what love is about. I hope my little girls grow up to be just like you. May God Bless you chicks.;Love your politics!

I truly enjoy the flavor of their music and the awesome instrumentals they never fail to deliver.\n\nThis new CD is like none other and is truly heartfelt. What a fantastic comeback.\n\n Who cares that some radio stations elect not to play their music?  Those of us who are loyal Dixie Chicks fans don't need to hear the music on the radio -- we just go and buy it.\n\nSadly, people have chosen this venue as a forum to critize the Dixie Chicks rather than rate their new CD.  It's doubtful that those individuals truly purchased and listened to the CD in its entirety.\n\nGive the Dixie Chicks credit for who they are and not ostracize them for voicing freedom of speech.  The only crime committed here was the moron who made the death threat....he/she should be sitting in the pokey.  Why is it that our society thrives on ridicule and pessimism?  Get over it and stop holding on to something that happened three years ago...;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE NEW CD
648;425.0;5.0;17.0;I suddenly became a Chicks fan in March 2003. One day I went to the store and bought every single one of their albums. This one is even better than all of those.;This is their best album.

674;427.0;5.0;17.0;If you are looking for good MUSIC this is it. It's a little bit moody country and a little bit broody blues, toss in a good hint of hick country and you've got this album. If you are looking for politics--please stop! Who cares? We're not electing these women! We're listening to really, really good music. They've always been good--face it! Even if you disagree with their point of view on the world, their music should stand alone. They don't spout off about political issues, this is not their pulpit, it's their album. It's good, solid music.\n\nI have to say I love the rock feel--heavy and a little dark--that mixes so uniquely with their sound on this one. It fits my mood when I feel pensive or angry, or sad, or even--ready to laugh and hoot and SCREAM. This album is really mature, and it shows the growth the ladies have made professionally (as artists).\n\nHow do I rate this? Better than all the other DC stuff. This is their best yet. And I'm basing this on the music.;ATTENTION: Great Music Here!
676;428.0;5.0;17.0;This has got to be the best CD that the Dixie Chicks have made. I love every single song on the CD.  I bought the CD a week ago and I haven't stopped listening to it yet.  I sing Lullaby to my daughter, it is such a beautiful heartfelt song.\n\nThis is my favorite CD and I can't wait to see them in concert this summer. If you are a fan of great music - you need to buy this CD.;Best CD yet!
684;429.0;5.0;17.0;"Perhaps those who can't accept that the Dixie Chicks dare to disagree with a politician should take the long way to China where people who disagree with the government are put in jail (or worse).  I bet they'd be a lot happier there than in American where we do have the right to do that.\n\nWe also have the right to listen to this great music.  The title track here alone is worth every penny and songs like ""Favorite Year,"" ""Silent House,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" and ""Easy Silence"" aren't far behind.  Celebrate our First Amendment freedoms and get some great music two.  What a deal!";What a Deal!
693;430.0;5.0;17.0;The Dixie Chicks are proof of what doesn't kill us makes us stronger! I'm overwhelmed with the depth of feeling and honesty in this CD.  Thanks to the good ol' boy establishment who tried to push them down and the kooks who threatened them, they've emerged much stronger and more mature. Like they said, they wouldn't change a thing even if they could. I'm so proud of them for daring to fight back and express their opinions so beautifully. I can't stop playing this CD - the more I hear it the more I love it!  Not only is the music great, but their message speaks for many of us Americans.  It's much more patriotic to speak up against a bad president than to blindly follow one.  Welcome back Dixie Chicks!  You were gone too long and now I hope you're here to stay.  Win a Grammy for album of the year!  The best revenge is sweet success!;Better than ever!
694;431.0;5.0;17.0;"I like them. Hey if you don't, don't buy this album 'cause I have important news for you. It has songs sung by the Dixie Chicks!\n\nI have one complaint there is a what sounds like a cell phone rin g in the middle of ""Not ready to make nice."" When I first heard it I looked around to see whose phone had rung, but then I thought it was a digital ink mark, 'cause I heard this from their website. But I bought the album thinking it wouldn't be there, but it is! Dang sound engineers! If it was meant to be there its annoying when I play it in a loop. But I still love the words of this song as it sounds like it comes from the heart.\n\nOk, as a protest song it isn't ""blowing in the wind"" etc. but it does speak to the heart of the issue. Who the heck would be ready to make nice after the treatment they got from the hayseed corporate radio stations. Fortunately we aren't required to only get our music from the radio. So go get'm girls, even fiscal conseratives are sick of the lying and cheating that's going on in Washington.\n\nAs for being a singer and somehow not being allowed to have an opinion, well last I looked in addition to the 2nd ammendment you'all love, the 1st allows everyone to complain about the government. Now if we could only get the justice dept. to respect the 4th amendment as well.";Yet another great album from the Dixie Chicks.
698;432.0;5.0;17.0;"I have been listening to this CD for 10 days now, and I like it better each time I hear it.  After the first listen I thought it was a great CD, but the more I hear the entire CD, the more I like it!  I couldn't care less about the political beliefs of the Dixie Chicks, although I agree with them, but I think their music is phenomenal.  Each song has a unique sound to it, and I hear something new each time I listen.  I understand people's apprehensiveness to purchase this CD, because it has been ""hyped"" to the max, but if you give it a chance you will be EXTREMELY satisfied with your purchase.  I would rate this CD as one of the top 5 I have ever purchased.  Can't wait to see them on tour!";Near Perfect!
721;433.0;5.0;17.0;"Simply outstanding. This is my favorite of the Chicks releases. Not one ""meah"" song in the bunch. Just a fantastic collection with Not Ready to Make Nice, Easy Silence, Long Way Around and Lubbock or Leave my top picks.";Hasn't left my CD player yet
732;434.0;5.0;17.0;"Personally I am not from the United States but China and I have to say I was really amazed to see Natalie Maines getting attacked so badly after making comments on President Bush. I always thought Americans can openly express themselves in public and share their opinions without getting any unfair judgments. Therefore I couldn't really understand why people had to make Natalie to apologize - But I feel happy to see the Dixie Chicks remain the way they are as you can tell from ""Not Ready to Make Nice.""\n\nI really think people should put focus on the music produced by the Dixie Chicks but not the political comments. It's just difficult not to like them and I have to say they are one of the most outstanding and influential bands in the century. Afterall, which band can always maintain a high quality of their songs? I have only listened to the whole album once and there are already some songs leaving me a very strong impression, like ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", ""Taking the Long way"", ""Bitter End""...Listening the songs of the Dixie Chicks is always an enjoyment, first it is because of the beautifully-written lyric, second it's for Natalie's powerful voice as vocal and third, the Erwin Sisters' wonderful skills of playing musical instruments. I have to say they make a really perfect combination with each other and you can't find any flaws even in their live performance. It's why I am always supportive the Dixie Chicks.\n\nI just hope people can be more open-minded towards the comments made by the Dixie Chicks and, if possible, give it a try and listen to their songs and you would know why there are so many supporters of the band. The Dixie Chicks really rock.";The Dixie Chicks never disappoint me
740;435.0;5.0;17.0;With American soldiers torturing and murdering innocent civilians in Iraq, Afganistan and Guantanamo Bay, only an American IDIOT would celebrate Memorial Day by remembering those evildoers who died.  I bought the Dixie Chicks new CD instead.  The music is great and so is their politics.  America got what it deserved on 9-11 and if we don't listen to the Dixie Chicks and vote Democrat in the next election, we deserve to get whacked again!;I CELEBRATED MEMORIAL DAY BY BUYING THIS CD
809;436.0;5.0;17.0;What a remarkable album! This is the Dixie Chicks BEST album to date in my opinion. Dixie Chick fans will appreciate the honesty of the lyrics. Just the best album I have purchased in years! Thanks Chicks for staying true and steadfast to your beliefs and who you are.;Bravo Chicks!!!
832;437.0;5.0;17.0;"I heard the single first and thought to myself: ""Good, Natalie's still angry.'' Then I heard the album and I went way beyond that to 'Wow!' They really are good musicians.''\n\nI liked the first three albums. But they really nothing more than nice, catchy, pop-country things with my two favorites written by others: Stevie Nix' ""Landslide,'' and Patty Griffin's ""Top of The World.'' This, written by the three Chicks, goes beyond that to real music, a little country, a little rock, a little pop, a little who knows. It defies category (why can't the country fans take that?) and spits in the face of the country radio idiots who want their stars to turn out formula garbage and won't play (as the Chicks pointed out in ""Home'') Cash, Haggard, and Hank Williams. In fact,  Nashville-based GAC won't play Haggard's ""America First'' video, presumably because it seems critical of the administration. Maybe the country stations won't play this _ they'll probably lose listeners that way, but who cares. Better to let Toby Keith and Gretchen Wilson parade around waving (and wearing) flags. (Funny they pose as 'outlaws' when the first of their breed were Willie, Waylon and Johnny, who were consistently bucking the forumla stuff.)\n\nPolitics. It's a good thing that they're not ready to make nice. What that really means is that they were a few years ahead of some of the rest of the U.S. in recognizing the Bush administration for what it was and is. One review called Natalie a hypocrite for apologizing and now going back to Bush-bashing. She didn't apologize: She simply said she shouldn't have respected the office of president. The Chicks' views are consistent and their anger remains _ as this album makes clear.\n\nBeyond that, it's a brilliantly written album. There's anger, loss, love, tenderness, even a bit of humor, though far less than on their earlier albums.\n\nI loved the Buddy Holly reference on ""Lubbock or Leave It.'' with a ""rave on'' in one verse and ""that'll be the day'' in another. The city has good musical genes. Not only are Buddy and Natalie (and her father) from there but so is Roy Orbison.\n\n I also loved the  gospel tinged finale co-written by Keb' Mo. They're keeping good company on this album: Keb, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer. All of them at the highest level of pop/rock. Not to mention Rick Rubin, the producer\n\nSo go on ladies: keep sticking it to Nashville. And to the administration. If Nashville doesn't like you, it looks like the buyers will. And if you lose some of your old fans, you'll get a lot of new ones _ like the reviewer who bought it to show her political support and ended up liking the music.\n\nOne reviewer welcomed the Chicks to the blue states. They were always there. My hope is that we are no longer divided into red and blue. If nothing else, the Chicks (with Dubya's help) seem to be turning a lot of red people into blue ones.";In Your Face
841;438.0;5.0;17.0;"Nearly four years after their last studio album ""Home"" and a little more than three years after ""the incident"" The Dixie Chicks return.  Not content to continue on the path they had been on for several years the sound here is different from what we've come accustom to from the trio.  The arrangements find the banjos and fiddles still very much in the mix, but less prominent than before and producer Rick Rubin, while avoiding an overly slick sounds (the is NOT a Shania Twain album and for that we can all be grateful) does give them more of a rock polish.\n\nChick fans who might be wary of such a shift can rest easy -- the trio's trademark harmonies are still in abundance here and shine through on virtually every track.  The first few listens might disappoint someone expecting another ""Home,"" or ""Wide Open Spaces,"" but the patient listen will be amply rewarded.  This is first rate stuff.";Don't Miss!
846;439.0;5.0;17.0;Will get best album of the year. I listen to this album and realise what great writers these are. Negative reviews are from upset christian republicans. Way to go girls!!!!!!!!!!;These are all american girls
858;440.0;5.0;17.0;"Being a fan of the Dixie Chicks since ""Fly,"" and since devouring all their material, I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this disc.  The first single ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" made the anticipation even that much harder to bear.  Finally the day arrived and I got it...and haven't stopped listening to it since.  Each song is brilliant in its own right, with its own message and meaning.  My personal favorites on the CD is the opening track ""The Long Way Around,"" ""Easy Silence,"" ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Lullaby,"" and ""Lubbock or Leave it.""  Every song is wonderful in its own right though.  Any fan that doesn't pick up this CD will regret it.  Politics have nothing to do with great music!!!

877;443.0;4.0;17.0;"The Chicks have a new producer, Rick Rubin. They've been pretty public about changing/growing in their music. You knew their politics. So,why are you surprised? At this point 215 reviews in less than a week of release. Indicates pretty good sales; the Chicks win. Most of the 1 star reviews are written by those with only the one review, so I must question if you've heard the CD. Many say 'I wouldn't buy this'; so, since you haven't heard it, who cares what you think. Bottom line, the Chicks are laughing all the way to the bank.";You knew what you were in for when you bought it
885;444.0;4.0;17.0;If you're expecting the traditional fun and high spirited Chicks cd this isn't it. This cd is a mix of mainstream and alternative country, rock, and even some R&B. It's much more mature and darker than their other cds. I would suggest listening to the cd and/or read reviews before purchasing because a lot of people made assumptions and are now disappointed. Standouts on the album: The Long Way Around, Easy Silence, Bitter End, Lullaby, I Like It, and Thin Line (bonus track at some stores).;Very different but still great!!
886;445.0;5.0;17.0;This cd is absolutely one of the best albums ever created!

889;446.0;5.0;17.0;"One thing's for sure: I think it's a safe bet to say the good ol' boys over at the White House won't be spinning the Chicks' latest minimum opus, ""Taking the Long Way"" anytime soon.\n\nBut it's all good: the girls---erm, ""Chicks""---are back in black and ready for a throwdown, and like the Three Witches from Macbeth---you know, Three Witches, Three Chicks! Double, Double, Toil-and-Trouble!---they're full of spit, fury, a little vinegar, and a whole lotta down-home Good Times.\n\nNow: the Chicks wanted to be Political, and Angry, and full of righteous rage, and so ""Taking the Long Way"" just won't---and can't---be divorced from its politics.\n\nAfter all, these are the Chicks who battened down the hatches way back in 2003, before the Insurgency, and IEDs, and waves of suicide bombings---and came out against a war which, as singer Emily Robison then put it, ""just warn't quite uh-right"".\n\nOh, and they created a firestorm by saying they were ashamed that Bush was from Texas---their home state---severing the Hapless President by his bloody roots from the Great Pantheon of Texans the Chicks presumably *weren't* ashamed of, like Lyndon B. Johnson, UT Austin belltower sniper Charles Whitman, serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, and of course Leatherface from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""\n\nDon't mess with Texas!\n\nAnyhoo, let's take a breather and step away from the politics for a sec: does ""Taking the Long Way"" really take the long way? Can you give it a spin, and dance to it? Does it sound real good? Absolutely!\n\nYou could be a little caustic and say the Chicks are just using ""The Long Way"" as a savvy little springboard away from Country Music and into Pop: given that they've pretty much lost their entire Country fanbase, I'd say that's not so much caustic as realistic.\n\nBut ""Long Way"" is definitely pop: it's slick, it's airwave-friendly, and, Merciful God, it doesn't have a single reference to binge-drinking weekends with a bottle of JD, horses, cattle rustlers, dusty trails, cheating ex-wives, smoky honky tonks, mechanical bulls, or the million whiney twangy things you'd expect from the genre. That's gotta count for something, right?\n\nIt's Red-State music for the Blue-State crowd, nice, clean, crisply produced by superstar Rick Rubin, and totally sanitized for your protection.\n\nIn the end, though, Emily Robison and her gal-pals---erm, ""Chick""-pals---want you to know three things: 1) they're angry, really angry 2) they're passionate; and 3) they're brave. Courageous, really. Oh, and in case you didn't know (and didn't pick it up from their hit single ""Not Ready to Make Nice""), they're not ready to make nice.\n\nI, for one, believe them. Look at how angry they are! It shows in their latest video, where things are blowing up, and dust is flying around, and they're all covered with black splotchy goo, calling to mind their magazine cover back in 2003 where they slathered their naked bodies with all the nasty names their close-minded former fans had called them.\n\nBut courage is courage, and anger is anger, right? Anyway, these Chicks are mad, hopping mad I tell you! I divide the Chick pantheon into three flavors: there is Horse-faced Chick, who sorta fades into the background and does her musical thang.\n\nThen there is Violin Chick, who kinda looks like Horsey-Chick, only angrier, and in the video she pulls her bow across the strings of her violin, making no doubt what Charlie Daniels might call an ""evil hiss"", though---I mean, hot d*mned tamale, Charlie---she does so with such force that you expect to see the strings to snap. I'd think it wouldn't sound so much like an evil hiss as a ""Yaaaark! Yaaarrk! Yaaaaark!"", but what do I know?\n\nFinally there is BigHeaded Chick, who is the angriest of all. Man does BigHeaded Chick emote: her eyes flash with anger, sadness, and torment. Her head is so wide and flat that she somewhat resembles Dick Tracy's old nemesis Flathead, who could launch spitfires off his aircraft carrier-sized head. Yeah. But she's angry, no doubt, in a kind of unhappy bovine way, suggesting a mortally wounded Bluebell the Cow, after Bluebell got a mouthful of some bad tickle-grass.\n\nIn the end, you've really gotta admire the Chicks. They're doing their Thang, keeping it real, and standing up alongside the thousands of American men and women who are risking life and limb and fortune to speak the truth and keep our Country free!\n\nAm I talking about our brave boys and girls in the US military? Nah, silly! I'm talking about our brave actors and singers, who are taking it to the streets!---folks like Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, and, umm, Cheryl Crow.\n\nBecause it's good to have brave folks in these fearful times, brave folks who can use their art---like the Chicks---to stand up to brutal tyrants, monstrous despots who terrorize their own people, who wage brutal wars of aggression against the innocent and helpless.\n\nWhat, you mean Saddam? No, no, silly, pay attention: I'm talking about---and the Chicks are singing about---George W. Bush, of course. Double Duh. Besides, make fun of George W. and you get on Leno; make fun of Saddam and you meet Pepe the Human Meat Grinder.\n\nSpeak Truth to Power, y'all! Giddyap!\n\nJSG";If you ain't a Rebel, you ain't Sh*t!
891;447.0;5.0;17.0;"I think all the Dixie Chicks albums are masterpieces, but it seems like they do something a little different on each CD - improving a bit on the last one. It's the mark of a great artist. This CD is country/pop mixed with Americana and a little 70s era power pop. The lyrics show they aren't backing down, and cover various subjects - from country weepers to Alzheimers. There are not many uptempo songs, but for me, that is not a problem. Each Dixie Chicks CD offers the listener a different experience. The frantic ""Lubbock Or Leave It"" does get you moving just as much or more than any other Dixie Chicks song. This is an album that artists like Faith Hill might approach if they didn't have Nashville limitations. But it has a distinct Dixie Chicks flair. I'm a Democrat, but regardless of political affiliation, their CD should be recognized for the stellar album it is.";Dixie Chicks make their best album yet
894;448.0;3.0;17.0;The album can be whiney and repetitive.  But for the all-pro studio production values, the songs -- especially the lyrics -- too often sound like the self-absorbed ramblings of coffee house open mikers who need to get over themselves. (Ladies, THERE'S your trouble). But I would have bought the album if it had 14 blank tracks. If Country Radio can shut them down over politics, I can support them over politics. Toby Keith is a better song writer, but he is my shut-up-and-sing-dumb-biatch. God knows I wouldn't want to sit through a conversation with him.  As for the Chicks...talk to me, ladies, all  night long.;More message than Music, but the Chicks are part of Iraq war history and the ultimate country outlaws

904;450.0;5.0;17.0;I bought the new cd Taking The Long Way, it is great. Who is it that is so offended by the Dixie  chicks?? I think their getting little or no airplay is so wrong. I,as an American citizen, am ashamed of our country shunning these women, why? because they stated an opinion! They have every right to exercise their freedom of speech. It is a right as an American. People have fought so hard and long  for that, and then someone uses it, and boom, they are out of the loop. I beleive we all should be able to exercise our rights without fear of someone threatening to kill us for it. We are a civilized nation, at least that is what I thought. So, Dixie Chicks, you keep on going with your heads held high,I hope this turns out to be your biggest selling cd. And it should be, we need to send a message to the media and the folks they have brainwashed! And that message is, it IS ok to state your opinion,and if someone does not agree, then how about settling for  agree to disagree??? Not by threatening someones financial status or lives!! I plan on going out and buying a second cd, just to help make that clear. Sandy Willis;Dixie Chicks, You go girls!!!

These ladies put it on the line for their beliefs. What's wrong, boys? Too chickenhawk?\n\nBeyond that, I must say that I enjoyed the music a lot more than I thought I would. A whole lot more. I've never been fond of country, but the pop, and, in spots, almost blues flavor made it a pleasure to listen to. This one will be living in my CD player for a while.";Surprised I liked it as much as I did
938;452.0;5.0;17.0;I have not yet been able to go a full day without playing it at least once - it was a long time coming, but well worth the wait. It has vibes of Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac which I guess is them carrying on from Landslide in Home. Its certainly beautiful and Natalie's vocals are haunting. Listening to this certainly beats revising for exams! Ones to particularly look out for are 'Everybody knows', 'Silent House', 'Taking the Long Way' and of course 'Not Ready to Make Nice' which is just a brilliant way to hit back at all those critics!\n\nFor anyone who refuses to listen to this due to the 'politics' surrounding it should really get a life and realise that the Dixies are just voicing their opinion in a land where you supposedly have freedom of speech. I deeply respect them for being honest and voicing the opinion of the rest of the world and not being afraid to do so. In the end - it is just music!;Brilliant!
940;453.0;4.0;17.0;It was probably inevitable that three young women who've spent the past three years fending off the poisonous pseudo-patriotism of people they've dedicated most of their lives to entertaining would produce this album. No, it's not standard country (who can blame them). No, there are no obvious hits (I doubt they care). What there is, is good music made by very talented musicians filled with feeling and emotion no country hit could ever dream of matching. If you want patriotism, join the Marines.;An album they had to make
941;454.0;5.0;17.0;I was all ready to trash this album, but upon listening\n\nI find that I can't.  It has great production (Rick Rubin)\n\nand some very cool songs.  There is not a song here that I\n\ndon't like.  Give the Chicks a chance.  You can't go wrong\n\nwith this CD.;Better Than Expected
966;455.0;5.0;17.0;To the 'one-star' wonders: your BRILLIANT words only validate your feeble minds.  The following review is an 'actual' review by someone who has actually listened to this amazing cd. The Dixie Chicks have always made beautiful music and this new cd cuts to the core of who they really are:  Three beautiful girls with amazing talents, living their life with honesty and integrity!  This cd is amazing from start to finish.  Thank you for standing up for yourselves and helping me, as a mother, teach my children to be independent 'free-thinkers'.;Have actually listened to the cd!
975;456.0;5.0;17.0;After hearing this song and seeing the 60 Minutes piece, I had to purchase this song.  It makes a personal statement and the Dixie Chicks never sounded better.  It's too bad that Country Music is inundated with so many narrow minded people that can't accept the truthful opinions about the 43rd President.  I concur with many magazine articles that state that George W. Bush is and will be the worst US President EVER!;Not Ready To Make Nice
985;457.0;1.0;17.0;I don't write a review unless i feel stongly about it.\n\nI'd give it less than one star if I could.;Sad
990;458.0;5.0;17.0;chicks are still on top of their game. All those annoyed by their comments on Bush need to get over it. I am sure none of their critics ever thought a minute about saying something bad about Bll Clinton. Buy this album. It is terrific.;good music, good politics
101;459.0;5.0;16.0;OK folks, it's time to forgive for those of you who are still caught up on Natalie's blunder overseas. Come on people get over it. Natalie's voice is full of emotion on this wonderful CD. She and the girls are so incredibly talented. GREAT SONGS, GREAT ALBUM! Again, we've all said or done really stupid things in our lives that we have been forgiven for. Let's provide the Dixie Chicks the same courtesy.;A VERY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN WHO STILL LOVES THE DIXIE CHICKS
148;460.0;5.0;16.0;"I first heard this CD in my friend's car.  I hadn't ever really listened to the Dixie Chicks before (other than their version of Landslide, which I also loved), but this album got me hooked.  I proceded to purchase their other albums, ""Home"" and ""Wide Open Spaces.""  I've even started listening to some other country music after hearing what a cool genre it can be.  These performers are incredibly talented, and I'm glad they stuck it out through all that they've been through in the past couple of years.  I didn't ""discover"" the Dixie Chicks until after their concert came through Washington, D.C., but I'll go next time they come back.";Amazing Album
173;461.0;5.0;16.0;"The Dixie Chicks are as gutsy and outspoken as ever.  The music is incredible.  So nice to have musicians actually exercise their right to free speech and not apologize for it.  This CD does not shy away from the problems the Chicks have had as a result of Natalie's remarks in the UK.  The death threats and hate mail are just part of the backlash.  I personally like title track ""Taking the Long Way Around"".  Reminds me of how people look at the G.R.I.T. (girl raised in the south) who moved to Southern California.  There are also some really beautiful ballads on the CD.  I bought two copies I like it so much.";The Dixie Chicks make me proud to have been born in Dixie
177;462.0;5.0;16.0;This is an amazing album...these three women have been thru so much and are still so talented..;Best album in years
209;463.0;5.0;16.0;i have been a fan from the first song i heard of theirs and remain to be.  this cd is true to form.  i don't care about political or any other views they may have.  i don't buy a cd to listen to their views i buy it to listen to their music and hear them sing and on this one they are tru to form!  and alas...very clever...making their point but very fitting for this day and time.  to not purchase this cd would truly mean that you were missing out on a good thing!!!  buy it...you will be glad you did!;VERY CLEVER
225;464.0;5.0;16.0;"I own every Dixie Chicks album.  I have never particularly liked country music, but I adore this group.  This new album has much more edge than the others and a more ""rock"" quality.  The music is catchy and fresh and the lyrics are absolutely an insight into their souls! There is not one boring track on this album. Aside from the much publicized ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", my favorite selection is the lilting, exquisite ""Lullaby"". This is a gutsy, interesting, wonderful collection!  No doubt about it; the Chicks continue to rule!";GOT TO LOVE THOSE CHICKS!
231;465.0;5.0;16.0;Heartfelt, great singing, intense lyrics.  Their music crosses over to many genres and is a great some back.;Great sound
288;466.0;5.0;16.0;"""Taking the Long Way"" is an excellent album that catches the essence of the brutality of the right wing smear machine by those mose affected by it, those who care engough to speak up.  It provides a view into the experiences of these brave individuals who spoke up at great expense both in reputation and in dollars.\n\nThank You for your courage";Long Way, Long Road
302;467.0;5.0;16.0;I loved this CD the first time I heard it, and my opinion hasn't changed a bit since. They have very strong songs on this CD, and it's a shame that radio won't give it a chance.\n\nYou know, being patriotic means loving the county, not loving the president. And just because one speaks out agains the president does not make them less patriotic, it means they are using their right to free speech. Those who tell the Dixie Chicks to shut up and apologize should recognize that free speech is a right, not to be taken away by partisan politics.(or else we lose that right).;Fantastic CD
312;468.0;5.0;16.0;"The Dixie Chicks were the class of country music, and their monumental success was testament to their depth of talent and hard work. Then the country music industry, and many of country's fans, abandoned them, and validated every negative stereotype about backwards country fans more than any editorial in a big-city newpaper ever could.\n\nDespite a boycott by country radio, this album has outsold every album in coutry music by a wide margin. Why? This is probably their most personal and mature album to date. While the sound has more of a 70's rock sound than their previous work, the anchor of their sound is still Maines's country-tinged vocals and Seidel and Robinson's 1st-class bluegrass instrumentation. Only a few of the songs hooked me at first (The title single and ""Not Ready to Make Nice""), but riding in my car on long trips this summer I simply couldn't turn the cd off. I kept wanting to hear more. Sometimes I'd just play it again and again until I arrived at my destination.\n\nThis work feels so real and personal...you feel that you know these ladies after you've heard this cd...and you'd like to be their friend or neighbor. I guess that's pretty cornball, but that is the most accurate way I know to describe it. This is the best album I've heard in the last few years. Now if I could just arrange that play date for our kids at the park...";"""Taking the Long Way"" is addictive"
325;469.0;5.0;16.0;I did not listen to the Dixie Chicks prior to this album but now I plan to purchase all of their CD's when they are released.;Great
334;470.0;4.0;16.0;"I didn't have very high expectations for this album when it came out. I kinda figured the Chicks were due for a clunker- I mean, 3 best-selling/critically acclaimed albums in a row- and how could they top ""Home"" (my favorite of theirs)? Also, all the B.S. surrounding their politics seemed like it would take the wind out of their sails and distract them. I wasn't even going to buy it- I had seen the video for ""Not Ready..."" and thought it rather tepid, with a clichedchord progression, actually kinda boring. But one morning I heard the beginning of ""Baby Hold On"" on the Imus in the Morning Show and was totally blown away. It reminded me how much these women have to offer musically. I bought the album shortly after, and was very impressed. I wanted to wait a little while after the inital couple weeks of listening, to see if I found myself still needing to hear it. I'm still needing to hear it. Just so you know, I'm not a huge country fan. I like the Chicks, Alison Krause/Union Station, and Dwight Yoakham. A little Wille Nelson and Johnny Cash. Other than that, my favorite country songs are ones by The Allman Bros, Stones, Zeppelin, etc. From my perspective, this album is country. It's got mandolin, fiddle, pedal steel, banjo- it's country. Maybe their least country, but still fits the bill. My humble impressions...\n\n""Taking the Long Way"" is as strong a leadoff song as on any of their albums. The harmonies flow like a waterfall and it has great energy. ""Not Ready.."" has really grown on me, and is now one of my favorites- I just needed to hear it in the context of the album, independent of the video. ""Everybody Knows"" is one of the best ones ...this and ""Bitter End"" (one of Natalie's best vocal performances on the album) display a vulnerability that is at once unexpected and disarming. ""Lullaby"" is beautiful, but a little too long, given how slow it is. ""Lubbock or Leave It"" seems to be the barnburner like ""Sin Wagon"" or ""White Trash Wedding"". Not as good as either one. I usually skip it, though I think the lyrics really needed to be said.  ""Silent House"" is cool- a loping, rocky beat and very lead guitar-esque violin solo. Very sad, very sweet lyrics. ""Voice Inside My Head"" is another standout...wonderful interlude with more of those oh-so-sweet harmonies. I feel the best track is ""Baby Hold On""- speaking of sweet harmonies- indeed it is one of best of their entire catalogue. Simply sonically beautiful, very powerful..just listening to the end where Natalie cries ""Hold on to me, just hold on to me"" give me the chills. A soulful song with a theme anybody could relate to. Nice solo by John Mayer as well. Any former fan who finds they can't listen to the Chicks anymore for political reasons should give this one a listen- if it doesn't soften your heart, well, it's your loss.\n\nIt's not their best album, but a worthy addition to an already impressive body of work. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, but it's a little too long to merit 5. I can see how hardcore country fans might turn their noses at it, but if you're open minded and/or a big Dixie Chicks fan, give this one a listen. And by the way- if you get all bent out of shape because an artist you like doesn't have the political views you assumed they had- that suggests a very fragile world view. Half the country feels the way these ladies do...get over it. Also- I love the picture of Natalie in the CD booklet. She looks super fine :)";Much better than expected
353;471.0;5.0;16.0;"I've always enjoyed this group's music since they first hit it big in the late 90s, but kept forgetting to purchase any of their chart-topping releases.  Then I heard (saw, I guess-I saw their music video) for their new smash single ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" and knew right then and there I HAD to get Taking The Long Way; boy, am I glad I did too.  The Chicks' deliver their most profound, introspective and meaningful disc with this one--the aforementioned ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" perfectly blends elements of both radio-friendly rock and country, making it for a very, very fulfilling listen.  The band's harmonies are better than ever and the songwriting done on Taking The Long Way is nothing less than brilliant.  This is one of the most satisfying CDs I've purchased in a LONG time.  I support free speech (isn't this a free country?) and am proud of the Chicks' for being brave enough to make statements about Bush.  Taking The Long Way may be a little deep and serious for some listeners, but make it through and you'll be left with a smile on your face and a deep love for this group.";Profound and deeply meaningful
393;472.0;5.0;16.0;"The Chicks come out swinging with what I consider to be one of the best collections of songs ever recorded.  Reba McIntyre put her foot in her mouth at the CMAs when she joked about ""The Dixie Chicks"" and their ""foot in their mouth disease.""  She should ""shut and sing"" and try to write and record something this excellent.  The songs tell it all.  The title track is one of those perfect summer songs.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those songs that make you roll down the car windows and sing it loud because you know all the words and it makes you happy.  You'll have to buy the CD or download the song because I doubt it if will be played on the radio.  I haven't heard a station play it in the large city where I live.  Not the country stations, nor the pop or top 40 stations.  But, like rebel artists in the past, word of mouth will get this music out to the people.  At least that will help keep it at the #1 spot on Amazon.com.  Well done Chicks.";Perfection
425;473.0;5.0;16.0;I just adore the Dixie Chicks!  I have loved each and every album that they have put out and this one certainly didn't let me down!  Natalie has such a wonderful and unique voice, and I'm so glad that she uses it to do more than sing!  I admire the chicks for their talent, their beauty, and their courage!\n\nLove those chicks!;Another Amazing Album!!!!
427;474.0;5.0;16.0;"What a terrific, satisfying, beautiful album.\n\nI was fans of the Dixie Chicks way before the ridiculous reaction to their anti-Bush statement; that fact that I agree with them made them all the more endearing.\n\nI am not by nature a country music fan; I can appreciate it, but I seldom enjoy it.  The Dixie Chick have been accused of not being true country.  Hamhocks.  But even if they weren't, this album is so engaging that it wouldn't matter what category it was.\n\nHelped by Renaissance Man producer Rick Rubin (last seen strutting with Jay-Z) and the most crack musicians on deck since Steely Dan, from John Maher to Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench (of TP's Heartbreakers) to Bonnie Raitt and members of The Jayhawks, this album is one of those rare gems where the sum really is equal to more than the parts.  Most impressive is that, unlike the DC's previous albums, the Chicks handle much of the songwriting, with help from some of the people above, as well as Sheryl Crowe.\n\nRather than seeming whipped and beaten by alienating some of their fans, the Chicks come out swinging and land knock-out blows.  The album is a masterpiece of melody and soaring harmonies.  Natalie Maines's voice is in top form, and the sisters weave their usually instrumental magic into every song.  Rick Rubin deserves special mention for bringing out the best in the Chicks.\n\nBest song?  Listen to ""Lullaby"".  No matter what your political persuasion, this album will have you taking the long way just to listen to Taking the Long Way.";Definitely worth Taking The Long Way - it's beautiful!
446;475.0;2.0;16.0;I have a couple Dixie Chicks CD's and this one is by far the worst one.  It is very dark, depressing and slow.  It doesn't have their usual upbeat, almost campy feel.  I was disappointed.;Not the normal Dixie Chicks
490;476.0;5.0;16.0;"When I saw the music video of ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" on VH1 I became a Dixie Chicks fan;  the video is outstanding as is Taking the Long Way cd.  I listen to this cd all the time- I love all of the songs, each one tells a different story- and of course ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is one of my favorites.";A New Fan
536;477.0;5.0;16.0;"Though I always enjoyed their music, I had not previously bought a Chicks CD.  I ESPECIALLY went out and bought this one the week it came out to show my support for the highly unfair treatment they received.  I heard many comments asking, ""Who do they think they are?""  The answer to that is that they are American citizens and one of the privileges is that we can say anything we want.  They have just as much right as any other to exercise their free speech.  So . . . you go, girls!\n\nAs to the music, it is smooth, fun and freeing.  Reminiscent of the Eagles and their brand of California rock, the harmonies are flawless and the melodies memorable.  My favorite tune is ""I Like It,"" a great, playful song to play in the car with the top down.  Enjoy!";Wholehearted support for the Dixie Chicks
544;478.0;5.0;16.0;My eighteen year old daughter hates country, and has mostly tolerated the other Dixie Chicks CDs I own. But, she and her friends love this CD. You can't really classify the album as country or rock. It is something in between. Original, like the Chicks are original. And each song is just beautiful. My favorite is Lullaby -- a truly wonderful tune that wonderfully describes a parent's love. Even my daughter likes it!;The BEST Dixie Chick CD yet
547;479.0;5.0;16.0;A superb album, from three lovely women who have been treated quite unfairly, if you ask me. And, I'm not really a fan of country music, but this record is so much more. One of this year's must-have CD's. 'Nuff said.;Superb Record
549;480.0;5.0;16.0;An CD with wonderfully, honest lyrics, beautiful voices, and awesome music that has my family singing along to the CD all the time. I think that if you really, truly, listen to the lyrics and the music you can't help but love this album.;Wonderful!
557;481.0;5.0;16.0;They hit it on the head with this one.  Great!! I had missed their harmony and spunky lyrics.;Taking The Long Way - Home
570;482.0;5.0;16.0;The new album is fabulous!  Keep up the great work and remember we live in a free country and are allowed to speak our minds.  Can't wait to see you in CA!!;Great Job Chicks!
577;483.0;5.0;16.0;A powerfully moving CD that also keep your toes tapping and heart engaged.  Standing up for themselves and the rights we share as Americans is what comes through on this CD.  Absolutely one of the best all around CDs I've bought recently.  I plan on buying a copy for all my friends and family members to share a great work of art and to support some really kick @ss chicks!;Strong and resilient in the True American Way
586;484.0;5.0;16.0;Heard them on Howard Stern and went and bought the CD.  All these people who cry and whine about what they say are very silly and immature and political kool aid drinkers.  Go listen to a great group who put out yet another great CD.;Just enjoy the music
597;485.0;4.0;16.0;"One of the most hyped albums of 2006, the new Dixie Chicks disc comes with a lot of baggage stemming from Natalie Maines' well-documented comments in London several years ago.  Getting past the politicking and posturing being exhibited by both sides on this review listing, while this album is not a 5-star classic, it is certainly one of the best albums of the year so far.  Rick Rubin's production adds just enough of an edge to the Chicks' sound to make this the most compelling country/rock album in a while.  The strong songwriting help from the likes of the Jayhawks' Gary Louris, Semisonic's Dan Wilson, and 4 Non Blondes' Linda Perry gives this collection more than its fair share of great hooks (""Silent House"" and ""Baby Hold On"" in particular), even if it is sometimes a little too obvious where the songs came from (""Voice Inside My Head"" sounds like a leftover from a Semisonic record).\n\nI've been reading a number of reviews here (as well as the less-than-worthwhile comments from people who haven't even listened to the record), and it is unfortunate that the controversy surrounding the group is preventing people from objectively listening to the songs themselves, without preconceptions or prejudice.  ""Taking The Long Way"" is a very good album which puts the Chicks squarely in the realm of middle-period Eagles, when they were in the process of moving beyond their straightforward country sound into the more rock-oriented sound of their late 70s records.  Not surprisingly, there's also more than a passing similarity of this record to Tom Petty's ""Wildflowers"", which was also produced by Rubin.\n\nI'm hoping that the hype surrounding the band will die down a little bit, and people will throw the labels away (is it country? is it rock? who cares?) and just take the time to enjoy this record more...bands like the Dixie Chicks certainly don't come along every day.";Too bad the politics keep getting in the way...
612;486.0;5.0;16.0;"I had never even listened to The Dixie Chicks, UNTIL this album. I have to admit, I was curious after the whole ""Bush"" statement, & once I heard ""Not ready to make nice"" (which made me cry it is SO powerful...and not just the whole political aspect, but the lyrics had a special meaning for me, and some of the stuff I have dealt with. Let go of the past controvercy, listen to it with an open head and heart, and you can't help but be moved by most of the songs on this album. The more you listen to it the more you will LOVE IT! GO DIXIE CHICKS!";My new favorite cd! ......Love the Chicks!
660;487.0;4.0;16.0;"i was never a BIG dixie chicks fan, i liked what i heard on the radio but never went further.  the other night i saw the music video for ""not ready to make nice"" and i was moved to tears.  i knew immediately of what natalie was singing, and the violins playing and just the pure impact of the song moved me.  so i went to barnes & noble and saw a magazine cover with them on it.  i went and bought the cd.  i did it partly because of such a beautiful song, and partly to support the dixie chicks because of the message they are sending out to america.  the cd is fabulous though, i've been listening to it everyday, and when i took it out of my car, i missed it.\n\nso let the dixie chicks be heard!!!";in support of the DIxie Chicks
667;488.0;4.0;16.0;I love the chicks! I even bought a copy of this cd from target so that I can order tickets to their tour early. I like this cd and it is their most serious album. All of the other cd's have been on the fun, flittery, female side. It was about 3 strong women having fun. This album is about the same 3 strong women faced with grown-up problems and adversities. This has less bluegrass. I love the bluegrass and wish there was more of that. Wonderful piece of art.;Seriously awsome!
689;489.0;5.0;16.0;Ever since I was introduced to an ALABAMA CD album about three years ago I started listening to the Dixie Chicks. This album sounds pretty good. And that's just it. I like their sound. They seem to have quite a wide range of moods and delivery in their musical repartee. This dynamic quality is what I like and they know how to sing to boot! Good one!;Good to Have them Back
702;490.0;5.0;16.0;That's pretty much all you need to know. Just buy it and enjoy it. The album contains great music, strong vocals et perfect lyrics.\n\nIf you don't have one Dixie Chicks album, this is the one to get.;A phenomenal album
708;491.0;5.0;16.0;Yes, it's early in 2006 but I bet this will be one of the best of the year. Politics aside, this is a mature well produced album. It has memorable songs, great lyrics, and you actually want to listen to it over and over.  It's a shame radio is not playing this record. It's a disservice to the public.;I dare you to find a better record....
715;492.0;5.0;16.0;I have all of the Dixie Chicks' CD's and this is, by far, my favorite musically.  The songs seem to have a soul of their own.  Thank you, Chicks!  I have been saying you would come back better than ever before, and you don't disappoint!;My Favorite
749;493.0;5.0;16.0;"...THE CHICKS ARE BACK...thank you, thank you, thank you...\n\ni loved them during their ""thank heavens for dale evans"" and ""shouldn't a told ya' that"" days...i loved them when i met them on 'the sally jesse raphael show' a little more than a few years ago...i loved them when they stuck up for their state and our country by telling people what was wrong with it...and i loved them for releasing another album of great music, in only the way they could do it...in only the way they should do it...";...not hiding under any ol' bush...
751;494.0;4.0;16.0;It took me a few times listening to the album before it really connected. Some of the lyrics seem a little sophmorish and incongruous in spots but, overall, it is a great album. I love how Natalie is really pushing her vocals as well as using a lot more sharps and flats to keep things interesting.\n\nMy main complaint is the productio. In parts, the album seems a little over produced. The Chicks have said they are really pleased with what Rick Rubin put together but I found some of the production distracted from the music and highly personal lyrics. I'm Not Ready to make nice is a bit too over orchestrated for my taste. I guess this is a matter of taste but, some day, I would love to see them do what the Beatles did with Let It Be, release a stripped down version.;Excellent songwriting but....
752;495.0;5.0;16.0;"Without a doubt, this is the best music on an individual CD that I've heard all year from start to finish. And why not, when you have Rick Rubin producing and the likes of Gary Louris (Jayhawks front man and songwriter extraordinare) and Dan Wilson (Semisonic guitarist and songwriter) lending their considerable talents to more than half of the tracks. There are also contributions by John Mayer, Neil Finn and other industry heavyweights. There's a lot of energy here and this CD comes out swinging from the first cut, the poignant ""The Long Way Around"", and never lets up. The thing that really resonated with me about this CD was that it has a maturity and a soulfulness to it that the Chicks have never fully displayed before. Obviously, what was laid down on this CD was very cathartic for the Chicks and songs like ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" are powerful statements and reflect that catharsis. The music and lyrics on this CD reflect a group of talented young musicians who have absorbed (and lived through) a big dose of how ugly life at the top can be when you are in the entertainment industry in this country. Your every word and move is chronicled and played back for you to defend at any given time. The Chicks should not be judged for any political statements that they have made, but by the music that they create. That being said, there are no duds on this CD.\n\nMy personal favorites include, ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", ""The Long Way Around"", ""I Hope"", ""Favorite Year"", ""Everybody Knows"", ""Bitter End"", and ""Baby Hold On."" I would encourage people who like Americana-Type music (Robert Earl Keen, JR., Son Volt, Wilco, The Jayhawks, Ryan Adams, Flatlanders, etc.) to give this CD a listen. I think Americana fans, if they are not into the Chicks because they feel they've lived too long in the ""New Country"" genre, will be pleasantly surprised at how easily The Chicks can reside in that Americana groove between country and rock. Give yourself a gift by getting this CD. This is as good as it gets, in any genre.";Best CD of the Year
764;496.0;5.0;16.0;Welcome to the main stream, Dixie Chicks.  From a mid 40's educated suburban mom with a career.  Glad you are broadening your audience and your music.  Love the country parts of it, love the crossover pop, folk, and R&B.  You are better and stronger than ever, and this album will appeal to a wide audience. There are tons of potential fans out there who never listen to country radio stations, but who will appreciate this album. You have won the bulk of adult America with this album. Serious, incredibly beautiful music.;Beautiful music
766;497.0;5.0;16.0;My view: most of the US now agrees (I totally agreed back then) with the statement you made a couple of years ago that got you in hot water with the radio stations.. If they don't play this CD a lot of listeners are missing out..\n\nGO Dixie Chicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;I support you ALL THE WAY Dixie Chicks
768;498.0;5.0;16.0;I bought this album after seeing the 60 Minutes segment on the Dixie Chicks--I was not previously a fan of their mnusic--but having listened to the album I just love this band and their music.\n\nI would like to thank them for standing up to bullies and giving others the courage to do so as well.  Very inspiring.;Thanks for your courage!
771;499.0;5.0;16.0;"Taking the Long Way is an absolute gem.  It is the first ""Country"" album I have bought in years, and I'm so very glad I did.  Every moment of it is musically light years ahead of the Jingoistic crap being spouted by today's LAME Country artists.  Natalie Maines' vocals are inspired, and reach new emotional heights; the instrumental playing is of top quality, and most importantly, the songwriting is absolutely brilliant.\n\nThe Chicks are so far above the radio that has spurned them, that history will look back on this as the album that knocked Country Music on its ass.  I couldn't recommend this any higher, and strongly suggest that if you are a fan of any kind of music at all, be it rock, pop, country, R&B, or whatever, you buy this album right away, and remind Americans what this country stands for:\n\nFreedom!\n\nThanks to all you freepers and idiot death-wishers.  You made me notice one of the most talented musical groups I have ever heard.  And to think I once lumped them in with the no-talent knuckledraggers like Tobey Keith and his band of uninspired hacks!";True Patriots Who Rock
781;500.0;5.0;16.0;"The Dixie Chicks are back and better than ever. This is the first album since the ""Top Of The World came crashing down"" three years ago. Yes, that whole thing is addressed on the album. It is the subject of the first single ""Not Ready To Make Nice"". The song ""Bitter End"" seems to be a goodbye to the fans who turned their backs on them. The rest of the album retains the ""Chick sound"" but at the same time takes it in a different direction. You can hear the growth as artists on the disc. There're aren't any ""fun"" songs like ""Goodbye Earl"" or ""Sin Wagon"" on this album, but there are a lot of songs that have something to say. How often do you hear that in country music?\n Some may say that Natalie is still whinning about the whole incident, and perhaps she is, but she has a right to. People turned on them and blacklisted them. They have shown that they can weather the storm and come out stronger. This album is for everyone who has stood by them, and for those that are willing to welcome them back.";Great album for those willing to listen.

799;502.0;5.0;16.0;This album is outstanding.  I have always enjoyed the Dixie Chicks, but never purchased one of their CDs until this one.  The lyrics are clear, to the point, and so meaningful.  Wonderful, wonderful body of work.\n\nIn addition, I'm ashamed of the small-minded fans who forced radio to cut the Chicks.  I disagree with many of Toby Keith's expressed political views, but I can still enjoy his music.;Love it
803;503.0;5.0;16.0;"Between the production and the song writing team (though the chicks penned half the tracks) and the A-list musicians that help out with this record, how could it not be great? Caught them live on David Letterman the other night and was blown away.\n\nI would blatantly disregard many of the sour grapes one stars found here...and note they're full of sexist remarks about how stupid and ugly the Dixie Chicks are (uh, this is music, you, uh, listen to it with your ears?). Not to mention they quote ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" by essentially saying ""Shut up and sing."" At best, they begin, ""Not what I expected..."" The typical response when people somehow feel they have ""ownership"" of an artist...perhaps they expect to be consulted before stylistic changes are made? Who gives a durn about your ""expectations""?\n\nAnyhoo, good for the Dixie Chicks; their music is simply far more thoughtful and deep and rich than the cliche-ridden goofy drek that passes for most pop country music these days.\n\nAnd the Dixie Chicks' politics are spot-on.";Note the locales of the one stars
804;504.0;5.0;16.0;"I don't think there has ever been a compact disc more over-hyped than this one.

This CD is a spectacular and she says her money was well spent!  In addition ot the title track there are songs like ""Easy Silence,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Bitter End"" and ""Favorite Year.""  Lovely stuff!\n\nTo the idiots who claim that only politically motivated Bush-hating fanatics could give this CD a postive review, I'll remind you that musical tastes are subjective. There is no right or wrong about it. And to think that the Dixie Chicks are so horrendous that only left-wing extremists could not hate their music is quite silly.\n\nBased on some of the language in some of the one and two star reviews, it seems pretty clear that many of those who are claiming to hate this CD are being motivated by pro-Bush political animus rather than by the music.";I Like It For The Right Reasons
827;505.0;5.0;16.0;"There is only one word to describe this CD: amazing. I have never heard such a beautiful compilation of songs. The first time I heard the single, ""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" I knew the Chicks were onto something, but I had no idea it would be so wonderful. From the defiant ""Not Ready"" to the touching ""Lullaby,"" this CD will keep you listening. My personal favorite is ""Taking the Long Way Around,"" a song I think we can all relate to (especially those of us determined to make it on our own- ""wouldn't kiss all the a**es that they told me to."")\n\nIf you are not buying this CD for political reasons, I would highly recommend that you put aside your prejudices and atleast listen to it. (And if you're writing a review and saying that you will never buy the CD, you probably haven't listened to it, so shut up.) Never have I been able to listen to the same CD for 4 days straight without getting tired of it.\n\nAnother note to those who are politically against this record: If you're going to ignore the Chicks, then you'd might as well start ignoring the 69% of the country that agrees with them.";An amazing CD- go Dixie Chicks!
835;506.0;5.0;16.0;"I agree with a previous reviewer.  Those of you griping that the Dixie Chicks haven't made a ""country"" album this go around ultimately only have yourselves to blame.  If the country music audience had rallied around the group when the bullies on the right were shouting them down, having public rallies where CDs and photographs of the Chicks were destroyed (in rallies that bore a creepy resemblance to Nazi Germany) and demanding that spineless programers are country radio station stop playing their music things might have turned out differently.  As it is the Dixie Chicks had little choice but court a different audience.\n\nFor that matter the Dixie Chicks have always had a more diverse audience which included rock and pop fans and it is these fans who have stuck with them.  Loyalty is rewarded.  Had the country audience stuck with them rather than trying to impose its own brand of ""political correctness"" on the Chicks you;d probably have a country album to review today.\n\nIn any case regardless of what label you put on it this is a superb album.  The Dixie Chicks once again prove their intelligence and talent and have created a work that will stand the test of time.  A song like ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" might loose some of its power in the years to come once future generations scratch their heads over what the big deal was over somebody disagreeing with an elected politician, but songs like ""Easy Silence,"" ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Lullaby,"" ""the Long Way Around,"" ""Silent Year,"" and ""Favorite Year"" will stand the test of time.

It's too bad for the world of Country Music...frankly it's their lost!\n\nI saw the Dixie Chicks live in a small venue in Los Angeles when they were just starting out, promoting their debut CD.  It's amazing how much they've grown lyrically and musically since then. Beautiful and meaningful, ""Taking the Long Way"" is a quantum leap from the beer-drinkin', redneck partying, thoughtless songs that seem to endlessly populate the country stations of today.  This is the Dixie Chicks at their finest: unbound, unrestraint, and uncompromising. Natalie Maine's vocal ability is simply superb, expressing a combination of both strength and vulnerability.  I usually don't write reviews, but this CD is so brilliant that I felt compelled to do one.  It's unfortunate that this CD will probably not be heard in most of the country stations.

This album is simply stunning in every regard.\n\nPrior to the Grammy Awards, I considered a Dixie Chicks an oddity and had never heard their music.

224;523.0;1.0;15.0;I have several other Dixie Chicks CD that I like but I just personally hate this one.;This CD is just not very good
267;524.0;5.0;15.0;"I was going to buy this CD no matter what, there are some artists (Patty Griffin, Kacy Crowley, Sarah Harmer, Beth Orton) that get a free pass.  I didn't know what to expect, I had heard snippets on NPR, but hadn't read any reviews.  The first listen came across as vitriolic and refreshing.  How nice to hear a woman get angry, I mean really unapologetically angry!  Songs like ""Easy Silence"", ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", and ""I Hope"" were comforting in their frustration.  I feel this way too, confused and angry about what is happening around me.  How nice to have some one put it into words so I can belt it out in my car!\n\nAfter a few listens (I really haven't taken it out of my CD player) I began to get a better understanding of the album.  It's not just raw anger, it is hurt and frustration, but also joy and relief and all the things that come with learning how to be a grown up.  ""Silent House"" is another startling gem about loss.  I recently lost my grandmother to several severe strokes.  This song helps put a name and a sound to the emotion.\n\nI am, in the end, just really happy that they didn't stop making music.  They are exceptional musicians, vocalists, and writers, and the best to rock-out with.  The album is not as melodic or lovely as Home, nor as playful as Fly or Wide Open Spaces.  But it is appropriate to the time we live in, it is so well done, raw and real, many layered and endlessly interesting.  Not an easy listen, but a fantastic one all the same.";I get angry/sad/happy too, sometimes

This CD is on the gift list for everyone I buy for.  Thank God for Natalie - someone with the strength to say what so many of us feel at a time when ""our"" opinion is somehow less worthy than any other.  Thanks, Chicks!";~Deep, Strong and Beautiful~
290;526.0;4.0;15.0;"Up until now, I had never purchased a Dixie Chicks album...I certainly respected what they had accomplished as artists over the past few years but, overall, they were just a tad bit too A) twangy and B) perky for me. However, picking up their latest, the captivating TAKING THE LONG WAY, seemed like a no-brainer. First, you had Rick Rubin producing, which certainly promised to be both challenging and interesting. Second, supporting the Chicks - after all they had been thru over the last three years! - seemed like a way to support freedom of speech...no one in America should receive death threats, simply for expressing an opinion, no matter what it is. Whatever my motives, picking up TAKING THE LONG WAY was a smart move - in one of the worst years for new music in almost two decades, it's a shining star, full of moments that are both earthy and edgy. Rubin has toughened things up, adding an appealing grittiness while still allowing the ladies to remain true to their country and bluegrass roots (Saying, however, that the Chicks owe, and have always owed, as much to Carole, Carly, Stevie and Sheryl as they do to Patsy, Loretta, Tammy and Reba, wouldn't be stretching the truth!). Things kick off with the sparkling ""The Long Way Around."" Amidst strumming guitars and layered vocals, singer Natalie Maines informs the listener that ""I could never follow."" This autobiographical track is also the first to hint at the past political broohah: ""I met the queen of whatever/Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies/Moved with the shakers/Wouldn't kiss all the a**es that they told me to/No, I could never follow."" Nice...very nice! ""Easy Silence"" is a gorgeous ballad about the security and sanctuary a solid, loving relationship provides (LOVE the tinkling percussion!), while the disc's first single, the barely contained ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" blows the Chicks' simmering anger wide open. Starting out in a hushed whisper, Maines soon shifts to a fierce wail, informing us she's ""mad as hell."" And why shouldn't she be, if the shocking lyrics are to be believed as gospel truth: ""It's a sad sad story when a mother will teach her/Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger/And how in the world can the words that I said/Send somebody so over the edge/That they'd write me a letter/Sayin' that I better shut up and sing/Or my life will be over."" Ouch! Among crushing, intoxicating orchestration, this is alt-country at it's best, infused with an additional dose of classic rock anger! Brilliant! ""Everybody Knows"" could easily fit on any Fleetwood Mac or Sheryl Crow album, what with it's easy-going vocals and lilting country-tinged arrangement. In fact, I would love to see Stevie Nicks cover this tale of regret, whispers and soul-baring and/or exposing on her next solo disc; I can TOTALLY hear that weathered, experienced voice intoning the line ""I am just barely getting by."" A real beaut! Among acoustic guitars, mournful fiddles and an old-world pub groove, the Chicks toast all the fair-weather friends who bailed on them over the past few years. Simple, yet smart, ""Bitter End"" is another winner! ""Lullaby"" is just that, a beautifully delicate tribute to ""The Seven Peeps."" Awash in almost-Beach Boys -like harmonies, this instant classic will be sung to or played for many a Peep at bedtime for years to come! Things take a 180 turn with the rockin' ""Lubbock Or Leave It."" Co-written with the Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell, there's an anxious urgency to this biting kiss-off of Texas (I particularly love the banjo-as-guitar riff!). Anyone who's seen a loved one slip away, due to the ravages of Alzhheimer's, will be able to identify with ""Silent House"", while ""Favorite Year"", co-written with Sheryl Crow, floats out of the speakers upon a gossamer groove. It could easily be argued that this is as much a pop song as a country one - the cut would fit nicely on a Crow album! - but if you listen closely, you'll realize that this is a prime example of how Rubin achieved his goal of wanting to make a record that sounded like a rock band doing a country album, versus a country act doing a rock album; all the best elements of both genres are there, and they blend in an achingly beautiful way (Maines' vocal does get a little pitchy at times, though). Second single ""Voice Inside My Head"", about a child given up for adoption early on and long ago, is sweet, sad, soulful and stirring, the stuff true gems are made of! ""I Like It"" has a sexy, spirited vibe to it, sort of like the Chicks - meet - the Bangles - meet - the Supremes (love, love, LOVE! the doo-wop backing vocals and chooglin' piano!). Yet another album high point! Things stumble a bit with ""Baby Hold On"", which just kind of drags on, but ""So Hard"", a first-hand account of sisters Emily Robison and Martie MaGuire's battles with infertility and the toll it took on each of their marriages, is gut-wrenching in both it's honesty and intimacy. Things wrap up with the Bonnie Raittesque ""I Hope"", a percolating blues number co-written with Keb Mo'. Surrounded by gospel chorus-like vocals, the Chicks fill us in on what the wish for the Peeps...and the world: ""But I hope/(I hope)/For more love, joy and laughter/(I hope)/You'll have more than you'll ever need/(I hope)/You'll have more happy ever afters/(I hope)/And we can all live more fearlessly."" Amen to that, sisters! (My disc also came with a bonus track, the traditionally bluegrass-flavored ""Thin Line""). All in all, I think it's safe to say that, with this latest release, there's a new maturity and greater depth to the Dixie Chicks. Here's hoping that TAKING THE LONG WAY is just the first step, that they can temper their anger and move on, continuing to grow by the leaps and bounds so brilliantly exhibited here (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).";"Stronger Than Ever, The Dixie Chicks Hang In There Until The ""Bitter End!"""

I have great respect for any artist that can do that and create music that is enjoyable to listen to.\n\nWhen I heard a clip of ""Silent House"" on that same interview I cried while driving down the interstate--and I don't even have a relative with Alzheimer's--the song is that powerful. ""Easy Silence"" is a beautiful song that has grown on me more each time I listen to it.  ""I Hope"" is one that my 6 yr old hums even after the CD is off.  Being a mother, I especially appreciate ""Lullaby.""\n\nThe lyrics in several songs are so true to basic human emotion that I am so past any political feelings one way or another and am loving this entire CD. In fact, I rushed to buy tickets to their concert here in September!\n\nJust listen to the music without your political perspective and you will appreciate their talent.  This CD is exceptional!";Ignore the politics, the songs are uplifting, spirited and often beautiful.
524;539.0;4.0;15.0;"I love the Dixie Chicks! Thank God there is a non-corny, progressive, modern, country act out there! So many songs on this album are great. ""Taking the Long Way,"" ""I Hope,"" ""Lullaby,"" and ""Everybody Knows"" are standouts, while ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is the song everyone probably listens to first. I think that a) everyone has the right to voice an opinion, b)people grossly over-reacted (in what was apparently a very hurtful and dangerous way), and c) the Dixie Chicks have no need to ""make nice."" They didn't do anything wrong. People criticize and disrespect the President on a daily basis, in the media and in private. They did nothing out of the ordinary. Let's just focus on the fact that they are the best country group out there, and that this is a great CD. For all of you who are still upset, it is time to move on. Let it go. Pick something else to be righteously indignant about already.";Love it
539;540.0;2.0;15.0;"A triumph for loud instrumentation as a proxy for content and meaning. What we loved about the DCs was their voices and the fun they brought to their music this album has very little of the former and none of the latter. Advice to the DCs ""Turn loose the pseudo anger and get back to your roots and the fun.""  Skip this album.";Louder, I can't hear you.....
540;541.0;5.0;15.0;I have always loved the Dixie Chicks music and their out spokeness. This has got to be their best music yet. What a great voice Natalie has and it just seems to be getting better. Can't wait for more from them. I support them 100%. Good job girls!;The best yet!
543;542.0;5.0;15.0;"I have been a Dixie Chicks fan since the very beginning! I own every single album from Wide Open Spaces to Taking the Long Way. I couldn't be behind the Dixie Chicks more! I cannot imagine what life is like for the girls now. I am personally sick and tired of hearing them bashed all over the country, I can't picture how sick of it they are. It's one thing to disagree with what Natalie said (I, for one, do AGREE with her!) and a totally different thing to slam them for it after all this time. I was absolutely stunned when it turned into such a big controversy! You see all kinds of celebrities speaking of their political beliefs or even protesting the war and they are not bashed like the Dixie Chicks have been. I think the Chicks are EXTREMELY talented and I couldn't be happier that they are standing behind their beliefs, saying what they think, and not giving a damn about what people think about them. This country has MUCH bigger issues to deal with right now than bashing the Dixie Chicks and their new album. TAKING THE LONG WAY ROCKS!! The song, ""So Hard"" hit me really close to home. It's not going to be easy for me to have children and to hear them sing about this was amazing for me! You feel so alone when you can't easily have a child like a woman should and this made me feel like I wasn't alone. Thanks, girls! The whole album is awesome! I am ashamed to be from the same country as these people who are actively against the Dixie Chicks and their music for stating their opinion on the President. Keep it up, Chicks! I love you and keep your music coming!";Amazing! I love the new album!
556;543.0;5.0;15.0;"It is hard to think of three singers in popular music who sound better together than the Dixie Chicks and regardless of the more polished, less twangy sound that this CD has such is still the case.  Here we have a showcase of more than one dozen songs in which the Chicks further establish that they were born to sing together.  The overall sheen and polish of this CD may be a tad off putting at first for those who loved CDs like ""Wide Open Spaces,"" and ""Home,"" but if this is all that is making you hesitate from picking this one up don't let it stop you.  Before long this will have a treasured place in your collection too.";Three Great Voices That Sound Great Together
581;544.0;4.0;15.0;I noticed a song or two from previous DC albums, but never felt inspired to buy until Taking the Long Way.  They caught my attention initially with their unique and fun style of music and performance and now show me that they are in fact musical artists. That can't be said of many groups I hear on mainstream radio in the area where I live.  Not to mention that I see things they way they do, which I didn't know could be true of the no-original-idea realm that is called popular Country music.\n\nTheir writing is strong, which as an artist I always appreciate.  When I heard the album and found it to be so solid I can't say I was suprised to see that it was produced by Rick Rubin who I love for his talent and direction shown on albums with The Beastie Boys, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Jay-Z.  Then to see the writing support of Neil Finn and Sheryl Crow and performances including Keb Mo, John Mayer and Bonnie Raitt, I'm not surprised by the sense of a collaboration on this CD which transformed the obvious vision of The Dixie Chicks into a great audio experience!  Cheers to the girls - my new favorite rock stars!\n\nI'm tempted to get into the politics, but feel inspired by the CD not to fall into the petty, small minded way of thinking that fueled the storm from ignorant, can't-think-for-myself sheep who attacked The Dixie Chicks in the first place (oops...i guess i got a little into anyway!).;Evolving artists with great support
601;545.0;5.0;15.0;Taking the Long Way is an instant classic.  It is a very personal and intimate album that plumbs a deep level in its heart-felt humanity, profundity, and musical virtuosity.  Taking the Long Way reminds me of another classic from an earlier time of wrenching change, Sgt. Pepper, in speaking for its period in history and breaking new ground.\n\nEvery song on this album is beautiful, has meaning, and only grows on you as you continue to listen.  Highly recommend Taking the Long Way.  Can't go wrong.;Best of Their Career - An Instant Classic
608;546.0;5.0;15.0;"Not much point in adding praises to what is here, but then again I am a little disturbed at those bashing the pro-American stand this trio takes and not truly caring about the music itself.  Freedom of speech is great but then again so is the right to bury your head in the sand when people like Natalie Maines speak the truth about what terrible leadership our wonderful country has.\n\nIf you don't love our country enough to hold it accountable when it blindly follows incompetent ""leaders"" perhaps you should leave it.";I Love My Country, But Fear My Government
663;547.0;5.0;15.0;Like some other reviewers, I wasn't entirely sold on the first listen -- it seemed a little somber, and I was looking for a few more up-tempo, punchy songs.  But listening a few more times brought me around.  This is by far their best album to date.  I love it!  I can't stop listening to it!  I love these girls!  They are talented and strong and smart and sassy.  They remind me of my dearest girl friends.  I can't wait to go to their concert this summer.  I have already bought the CD for myself and for my best friend and I think I am going to buy it for at least 5 more friends, because, really, it is just one of those CDs you HAVE to have in your collection.  Cheers, chicks!  I am proud to be a fan!;I love my chicks!
682;548.0;5.0;15.0;Kudos to the Dixie Chicks.  They exercised their right of Freedom of Speech and said what most of us were thinking.  I salute them for exercising the rights that our troops are fighting and dying for.  Its a shame that they received so much hatred from the citizens of this country.  We don't all have to agree with each others opinions, but we all have the right to have opinions.  Thats what this great land is all about.  If they would have made the comments now rather than 3 years ago, there wouldn't have been even a feather ruffled.  Jay Leno and David Letterman tear down the president on a nightly basis and nobody has a problem with it.\n\nThis album was great...its a great comeback for them!  I am excited to see them in concert and to buy future albums!\n\nWay to go Chicks!;The Dixie Chicks Rock!
716;549.0;5.0;15.0;Just play the Not Ready to Make Nice cut and play it again and again.\n\nThey were right. And now 72% of Americans agree with them. With Springsteen's Devils and Dust, the best anti-Iraqi war albums yet.;Dixie Chicks Were RIGHT!
718;550.0;5.0;15.0;"Putting aside all political views, ""Taking The Long Way"" is an extrodinary album.  It is the most mature and powerful album they have ever made.  Every song has a message.  The only song I don't care for is ""Lubbock Or Leave It,"" which a lot of critics think is one of the best songs on the album - go figure.  I think every other track is a gem.  It does, however, take 2 or 3 listens to truly appreciate it, I think.  The subject matter is so deep and the songs and instrumentation are so intense -- it's not light, breezy listening.  The Dixie Chicks make great records, no two ways about it, and this is no exception.\n\nMy favorite tracks:\n\n*The Long Way Around\n\n*Not Ready To Make Nice\n\n*Everybody Knows\n\n*Bitter End\n\n*Favorite Year\n\n*Voice Inside My Head\n\n*I Hope";Long Time Gone, but worth it
726;551.0;5.0;15.0;Every song on this CD is GREAT! I think it is their best yet! I am proud of the Chicks for standing their ground. Good for them. This is America and we are supposed to have free speech. Good luck to the Chicks. I don't listen to ANY of the country music stations that stopped playing their music. As a matter of fact with the exception of a few artist I don't listen to country anymore at all. Toby Keith makes me want to gag! If you are a chicks fan or just a fan of GOOD MUSIC then I would buy this CD!;LOVE THIS CD!
731;552.0;5.0;15.0;"This album is by far the best Natalie & Co. have put out.  The whole album is enjoyable.  My favorite song is ""Everybody Knows"".  ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""The Long Way Around"" are right up there too.  I don't get the people who are saying it's too pop?  A very enjoyable listen all the way through.  I can't wait to see them live in August!  :)\n\nAlso, the anti-Chicks people need to get over themselves.  Since when has politics and music not gone hand and hand?  At least they aren't out telling kids to ""Get Drunk and Be Somebody""!  That's responsible????????  Those are NOT THE VALUES I'd ever teach my kids.";"Dixie Chicks are once again ""on top of the world""."
753;553.0;3.0;15.0;I was listening to this album and didn't realize that I had listened to half the album....thought it was the same song. A bit of exageration here but that was my impression.\n\nPerhaps their other albums (many songs) were so powerful that I expected to hear some of the same here. Perhaps we are inundated with music. There is so much audio/visual out there.;Good..but many of the songs just meld into each other..
765;554.0;5.0;15.0;I've just read many reviews here. Those in support (me too) were eloquent, well thought out, reasoned and reasonable. I have my copies of the new CD, and I find I can't find the words to express how truly great this new work is.\n\nOddly those against, seemed to sound like some kind of knuckle draggers that never finished school.;Speechless
814;555.0;5.0;15.0;"Great to see the Chicks back with all of their vigor and feistiness.\n\nAs a red state Texan, the foolishness of FM play time vs download sales diminishes the true recognition that DXC continue their evolution of song writing and musical style.\n\n""Voice Inside My Head"" and ""I Like It"" represent the style spectrum within the album.\n\nI'll still watch my CMT, listen to FM while traveling I-35, but the iPod will have the DXC's ready to go as a favorite.";Welcome Back Ladies...
818;556.0;5.0;15.0;The women rise to the occasion here and create sweeping lush music. They soar so high above the hateful masses who bash them they might as well be from another (celestial) world.\nThank God for the Dixie Chicks. They give me hope and provide beauty in a mad and increasingly ugly world.;Above and Beyond
820;557.0;5.0;15.0;"Oh man, where to start? This is about the music; go elsewhere for a political or calculated business statement.\n\nNatalie's pipes are as powerful as ever; there's a catharsis; real emotion behind every verse.  The sister's harmonies sound great (as always), but in my ear somewhat uber-lushed/ over-produced, from earlier efforts (i.e., previously you could sort out Martie's voice from Emily's). More significantly, I miss the sister's chance to show their masterful musical chops on the fiddle, mando',`jo and 'bro.  (Ok, maybe business acumen crept in).\n\nRick Rubin, the dude with the Midas touch, arrived at the right time and place.  The DXC's needed a strong rebound.  As I see it, this is yet another phase of their ongoing musical evolution; they're still kicking down doors and still have a lot more to say.";Actually 4.5 but this gets me published.
821;558.0;5.0;15.0;"I have been a fan since Wide Open Spaces and knew this was coming home with me the day it was released.  I hate what happened to them in 2003 and as another commenter said, I always thought Reba had more class than she showed at the ACM's the other night.\n\nHaving listened to this CD several times now, I'm convinced that the Chicks have just done what we're all doing -- matured.  They are women with children, spouses, and responsibilities and we see that in the music they're choosing to sing now. They aren't the same group they used to be, but that's not to their detriment.\n\nMy favorite tracks?  Lullaby, Easy Silence, I Like it, Favorite Year, So Hard, and I Hope.\n\nThis CD will hold up well and will be a classic.  And you know, unlike songs about being ""All Jacked Up"" or Trace Adkin's latest greatest, these are songs I would be comfortable letting my son listen to.\n\nPersonally, I hear harmonies all over the place.  Natalie is the lead singer of the group, so it's not really surprising that you hear more of her.\n\nAnd you know, politically, they deserve the support given the childish antics of country radio.  Sorry guys, but you're wrong on this one.";Absolutely Outstanding
824;559.0;5.0;15.0;"I loved this album. The narrowminded people who crucified this group for merely expressing a political view will not like it.  These closeminded people only believe in freedom when the views expressed agree with theirs.  An amazing comeback album because the group continue to show courage by standing up for the freedom to express their views, yet reveal the pain it causes.  I especially loved ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""Bitter End"". You can feel the anger and sadness in each of these songs.";Great Album
828;560.0;5.0;15.0;Most of us never get to the point in our lives that we have to make a choice that involves putting our professional lives on the line for what we believe in. Some of us do. Such is the case of the immensely successful Dixie Chicks.\n\nIn a case that reflects the nation's agony over the Iraq war the Chicks found themselves outcasts after expressing political opposition to the war.  A country music backlash ensued where they were banned from many country stations and received death threats at concerts.\n\nMy local Baltimore country station has basically ignored them since then. Radio talk show hosts have attacked them.\n\nThis album is their first since the controversy. Suffice it to say that it isn't often that we get to listen to artists basically put their careers on the line. Happy to report the Chicks have not backed down and have produced some great music at the same time. The album is not the kind of music that made them popular but reflects a more mature view of the difficulties they have endured both professionally and personally since 2003.\n\nWith help from Rick Rubin, Bonnie Raitt, Keb' Mo', and John Mayer the Chicks have produced an impressive effort that one way or another they can be proud of and that we can all enjoy as an honest artistic expression under diffucult circumstances.....and some great music.\nYou could feel safe in buying this CD because of the music or to support the first amendment....or both.;Blood and guts
829;561.0;5.0;15.0;"Aside from the incredibly great cd- I am very proud that the DC stayed true to their feelings.\n\nBravo for them.\n\nThe irony of those who have threatend the DC for their comments in 03 have likely never had a family member of friend serve in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nTo those who didn't like their comments and went off the deep end because of it- put yourself in the shoes of parents and friends who have lost loved ones because of the Lie of ""weapons fo Mass destruction""\n\nI for one am heartbroken for my friends and family members who have lost their lives in Iraq.\n\nSo if you don't like what the Dixie Chicks said ""Get over it""";Amazing -great
831;562.0;5.0;15.0;"The anger rocking around this country is going to get a lot worse in the coming months, when people finally wake up to what W and his crew of school yard bullies have been up to with the environment, regulatory laws and agencies, medicare, taxes, immigration, the oil industry, judicial appointments, and the polarization of America, which to me starts at the top and filters down. So it's a great pleasure to hear these artists still pouring gasoline onto the fire. I have loved their music ever since my wife saw them live in Toronto during a business trip and came home stark raving mad about them. She had me listen to their Top of the World tour, and I quickly fell completely in love with their musicianship, their lyrics, and their overall sass.\n\nIf artists create masterpieces, their audiences grow to expect genius every time out of the box. I think this album is excellent, but if you've never heard a Dixie Chick song (what planet do you live on?), I would start listening to ""Fly"" and then eventually get to this one. It's true that the Dixie Chicks have always had a ""blue"" state audience, and maybe they will turn some red states blue, but those states I think are finally catching up to the Chicks, and I pray are turning blue all by themselves. Once money leaves people's wallets, they get around to asking some questions about who's taking it.\n\nAnyway, the Dixie Chicks are artists, and their work will outlive any petty political attacks from the right. Long after the current crew of politicos have left the scene, people will still be taking comfort and joy from the songs of Natalie Maines, Martie McGuire, and Emily Robison.";Go Get Em, Chicks!
842;563.0;5.0;15.0;I thought HOME was their most personal, and home rooted, album until I heard TAKING THE LONG WAY. Natalie, Martie and Emily bare their hearts and souls and pour both into this brilliant album that has an eclectic mix of country, pop, motown and R & B. I love all the songs, but NOT READY TO MAKE NICE and I HOPE really move me. I feel like I can relate to these songs, not the same way the girls can, but in my own way. Like the girls, I've managed to hold my head up high through a lot of pain and tears. It's like I'm listening to my own biography. It's funny how pain and tears and incidents can make an album all the more better. BRILLIANT!!!!;TAKING THE LONG WAY-DIXIE CHICKS
863;564.0;4.0;15.0;"When I bought the CD, I had already heard ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""Lullaby.""  ""Lullaby"" is just a sweet song with a ""feel good"" 60's vibe.  The title track has that same vibe.  ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is a powerful song that just builds upon itself and the strings are amazing.  I loved the Celtic-influenced ""Bitter End""  and the gospel-influenced ""I Hope.""  What a fitting last track!  If I had been expecting a country album, I might have been disappointed.  This CD just proves that the Chicks don't need to limit themselves to one genre.";4 and a half stars!
896;565.0;5.0;15.0;A superb CD....  vocals= A+, harmonies= A+ lyrics=A+  These women deserve to be heard....They are a major force in the world of music and in the world period. There is not a bad track on the CD.  Hard to believe people are still up in arms against free speech...and Reba lost a lot of credibility with her un-funny comment on the awards show 5/23.;Amazing....
898;566.0;5.0;15.0;"You cant get any more ""country"" then the legendary Johnny Cash, and some of his finest work came from his working with Rick Rubin! The Dixie Chicks are extraordinary talent, Natalie can outsing the best of them and this cd rocks. I have always been a fan of the Chicks, and will continue to be so. When others were smashing their cd's for Natalie's opinion - I was singing along to Long Time Gone while still being a fan of Toby Keith also! Freedom of speech is what America is about, to say the Chicks have no talent due to speaking their opinions is ridiculous, and to give a cd poor reviews based on a personal prejudice against them without even listening to it is not right. Their musical talent should be separated from personal opinions. They are not the first in the music industry to speak their opinion regarding government and politics, but they have been shunned more than others for it. Why won't the majority of country radio stations play their music, when there are listeners who would like to hear it? Here is hoping that the popularity of this cd changes that.";Rick Rubin only works with the best!
913;567.0;5.0;15.0;The new long awaited Dixie Chicks album is amazing.  It is their same great sound infused with lots of life lessons.  Great album! These girls are a true inspiration for standing up what they believe in and making great music.  I am truly inpired!;Amazing new album
928;568.0;5.0;15.0;It has been some time since the Home CD came out, but this one has been worth the wait! This CD features many great special guests on this CD.

942;569.0;5.0;15.0;"First, this review is about the cd and not about their politics.  There are many Texans that felt and still feel the same way they do about current events.\n\nI've never been a ""County"" music fan but I've alway been a Dixie Chicks fan.  They appeal to me as a women.  It's obvious to me that the negative comments are not from real fans of theirs.  I've actually listen the to cd (unlike many of the negative comments) and I like it.  I will and have recommended to my friends.  Change is good.  I'm actually glad its not so ""Country"".\n\nKeep it girls!";Welcome Back Dixie Chicks
943;570.0;5.0;15.0;"Before I get to the review part of this, I will address the obviously intelligently challenged one star bigots.  One, Natalie and the rest of the Chicks are beautiful, courageous, and very talented young ladies, the ones commenting on their appearance, particulary Natalie (and you MEN who are more than likely in the closet wannabes know who you are)are obviously not seeing the same group as the rest of us.  Second, the Chicks are not ""whining"" or trying to draw attention to them.  The redneck idiots who can't think for themselves and believe all the hype force fed to them are the ones doing that for them.  Now on to the real review...this is one STELLAR album.  The music flows and I love the meaning of each song.  This is Dixie Chicks at their best!  I have been a fan of theirs from the get go and am PROUD to say so!  I support them 150%!  If you are looking for a very innovative, fun and inspiring album, that is full of the emotion of the times, this is a must for you!  If you are one of the politically challenged who just can't seem to wipe the ""red"" off their neck, stick to the cookie cutter artists such as Toby Keith and good ole Reba.";Dixie Chicks....Back and BETTER than EVER!!!

947;572.0;5.0;15.0;"""Wide Open Spaces"" has always been my favorite song.  It came out as I was leaving for college and was amazingly appropriate.  But, this CD is phenomenal.  I love it from beginning to end.  The Dixie Chicks have been through a lot and that is shown in their music.  They truly represent what America is about.  Americans should be standing up and saying, ""I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend with my life your right to say it.""  That so many ignorant comments have been said about the Dixie Chicks regarding their stance against the war and our president is to me truly frightening.  I will continue to support The Dixie Chicks and others who go against the grain.";Viva La Dixie Chicks!!!
967;573.0;5.0;15.0;"What a treat! I'm so glad our Chicks are back and what a way to re-enter the musical arena! Their latest offering is full of heart, truth and thought provoking lyrics.

991;574.0;5.0;15.0;It's great music, but it also means something to a lot of people. And that's what good music is all about!  You might not like their politics, but anyone who denies this is a good cd hasn't listened to it!  We all know who you are:);Love it!

176;578.0;5.0;14.0;Okay, I never listened to the Chicks before since I was not a big fan of Country music. When they got criticized for speaking their minds, I thought that I would support them and buy the CD, not expecting to love it. But I do. What a great CD! Rockin' songs, ballads - they are all good. I even went to see them in concert and was amazed at how good Natalie sounds in person too. What an amazing voice! Even my 13 year old son likes listening to this CD. The Chicks rule!;A new Chicks fan!
204;579.0;5.0;14.0;I noticed the negative reviews were coming from people who didn't like the chick's personal opinions about the president.  Well, be that as it may, this is a great album and a lot of people must agree because at least on Amazon it is selling well.  When I purchased my copy, it was rated #20.  Not bad.  I guess most people don't care what was said or maybe they even agree.;Great Album (which seems to be selling well!)
226;580.0;5.0;14.0;So much better than any of their other albums.  This CD is much more personal than others, and the music is amazing with tightly knit harmonies through the entire cd.;Their best CD yet!

275;582.0;5.0;14.0;Forget what anyone says ... this is another awesome album from the Chicks.  Each album is as good as the last - they never disappoint.  And as for the criticism that this album is all about over emotional songs on topics like infertility and parents dying, isn't this what we all expect from an artist - addressing a subject that has touched them and they can truly be passionate about.  I would have a hundred songs like that before a single one from another pre-pubescent teenager ranting on about love and broken hears.  Let's for once respect a few years under the bridge and some real life experience in music.  That is what it is meant to be - heartful and personal.  So ignore any naysayers - this is the third in a row of stupendous Dixie Chicks performances.;Brit who loves Country

The banjo solo in ""Lubbock or Leave It"" is funky, ""Lullaby"" is soothng and of course the hit, ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" demonstrates their mature conscientiousness.";They're Back and Better than Ever
293;584.0;5.0;14.0;The Dixie girls' vocals are better than ever.  Lyrics, of course, are primo and to the point.  Gotta love women who stand behind what they think instead of wimping out for the cowardly radio stations who prefer to cave in to a small amount of screamers rather than the majority of their fair minded listeners.  Hope you radio stations out there get a back bone, this CD is FABULOUS!;One of their absolute best - don't be without it!
297;585.0;5.0;14.0;"I awaited this CD with some trepidation. I was a fan of the Dixie Chicks long before ""the incident"" in 2003; though I happen to then and now agree with their distain for George Bush, I was afraid that this album would be somehow 'tainted' by the harsh feelings that have been generated by both sides. My friends, I was BLOWN AWAY by this album. I listened first to the most awaited track ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", which immediately became my favorote song, but then sat back and listened to the entire album. I have now spent hours listening, and each time come away more impressed with the talent, intelligence, emotion and beauty of these three women. I find it sad that so many people will miss out on this work of art because they seem to have allowed thier political beliefs close their minds. This CD is now the favorite of all four members of my household, and it is rare in my home for us to all agree on anything!\n\nBravo Chicks!";The star of my music collection
322;586.0;4.0;14.0;"The music's good.  Buy it!  I wish it were more country; but it's still good, and I'd buy it even if it were average, just to counteract the extreme overreaction to a statement one Dixie Chick made in one little bar in England, I think it was.  Money won't make up for the fear they live with every day, worrying about crazies attacking them and their families.  Enjoy the music, before the extreme right takes that away from us, too!";More Power to 'Em
331;587.0;5.0;14.0;One of the best CD's in the last several years.  I was quite happy to see the Dixie Chicks come back with such honest emotion and effective music to back it up.  AAAAA+++++;The Chicks are back !!!
344;588.0;5.0;14.0;"Recently I was riding in my car with the guy I'm dating, and I was listening to this CD for like, the 100th time. He said, ""You've been listening to this CD a lot lately, haven't you.""  I don't do drugs, but I told him, ""if I could stick a needle in my arm and listen to this album that way, I would."" I wasn't kidding. This may be the best album I've ever owned.\n\nThe songs are extremely well crafted. Every one of them. Great lyrics. Catchy melodies. Many of them are simple pop songs, but they are all just so damn good. It was well produced. The songs all have a unique style that you may not be able to notice on the first listen but once you hear it it really grows on you. I'm a musician and get goosebumps (partly from envy) when I hear an artist who has made something that's really inspiring and well crafted, that took a lot of thought and effort. And the Dixie Chicks have definitely done this. What a heartfelt album. I have all their other CDs but this one takes the cake. It's one of those CDs where the next song comes on and I'm like, oh, this song! I love this one, and then the next one comes on and i think Oh, I love this one too! And I keep doing that till the last song, ""I hope,"" ends. This album just keeps me wanting more! I can't wait to see them in concert.\n\nAnd what the heck is up with E.W. from San Francisco leaving the same nasty review twice? Hello. Can I please submit this one twice too? Crimony. Bust out the q-tips woman.\n\nPlease don't listen to the nasty reviews, or anyone who says ""it's just not good music.""\n\nListen to the sound samples and see for yourself. These songs are undeniably catchy and this is just really, really GOOD music!";If I could listen to this album intravenuously I WOULD!!!!!!!!
359;589.0;5.0;14.0;I put on the CD and I fell into this wonderland of different sounds and raw emotion. It was by far the best cd I have heard in a very long time.\n\nGood for them;Gold Magic
361;590.0;5.0;14.0;"Through this album, the Dixie Chicks demonstrate that they have found their center, their artistic, aesthetic, and political home. From the gentle pride of ""Taking the Long Way,"" to the stridency of  ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" to the sublime gospel sounds of ""I Hope,"" top to bottom, this album is an outstanding compilation of work. Best of all, the Chicks co-wrote each song, making this album personal, poignant, and practically impossible to take out of the CD player.";Play it early and often
378;591.0;5.0;14.0;I have always enjoyed the Dixie Chick's music and this is one of their best. I hope their album and tour are a huge success. I have been embarrassed that country radio, fans and even fellow artists have decided that Free Speech is their's to wipe from the Bill of Rights.  Shame on all of you so-called Americans that have attempted to destroy a career because the Chicks expressed on opinion contrary to the politically correct point of view.;So Glad They're Back
390;592.0;5.0;14.0;I purchased this album because of the political boycott that country music perpetrated against the group. I am not a country music fan. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this album. It is part country, part pop, and part melodic music (e.g., Jewel, Norah Jones). All it was missing was a few heavy metal songs :);Politics and music
412;593.0;4.0;14.0;I have all three of their previous albums, and I think that this one is comparable to the other three.  I like the harmony, the new beats, but the same old Chicks.  I love all the songs on Taking the Long Way, just like on Wide Open Spaces, Fly and Home, and I can't wait to hear these ladies in concert in August in Chicago!  GO CHICKS!;Dixie Chicks are my pick!
436;594.0;5.0;14.0;"This is one great CD. I must admit that I've never been a great Country music fan, though I've been to the Jamboree in Wheeling, WV several times. But this new CD from the Dixie Chicks actually out does its billing.\n\nThe first track, ""The Long Way Around"" is a deeply moving song. It may rank up there among the all-time great songs, of any genre.\n\nAnd there is not a weak song in the bunch.";One of the best
441;595.0;4.0;14.0;"I generally dislike country, and pop; and I generally gravitate towards heavy metal/hardcore/punk rock.  But i'll be damned if this cd isn't pretty good.  I originally bought it because I agree with their politics, and found the first single to be stuck in my head.  I soon found the rest of the cd to be done very well.  On a completely unrelated note, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT SUCKS.";I Like This CD!
451;596.0;5.0;14.0;I bought the new disc about two weeks ago and I haven't stopped listening since. I love that the chicks are exploring new musical territory, but still staying true to their roots. Love it!;Can't stop listening!
452;597.0;5.0;14.0;"First of all, I have to start by saying that this\n\nCD is great and that the Dixie Chicks have matured\n\nin their music since their last release. It has\n\nbeen three years since The Dixie Chicks have made\n\ntheir comment on our president, George W. Bush.\n\nOn Taking The Long Way, the Dixie Chicks combine\n\nbeautiful piano ballads and lovely violin with strong\n\nvocals. ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the perfect\n\nsong to debut off their CD.";Back And Better Than EVER!
455;598.0;5.0;14.0;Everyone needs to forget about there dumb controversy with what was said about the president. There are so many rap songs that insult or say really terrible things about everyone in all walks of life. Dont get me wrong I like some rap, but she made one comment give her break. Its free speech in USA. Its all about the music anyway. I think its a great cd.;Great CD
469;599.0;5.0;14.0;"The Dixie Chicks don't wait very long to remind us of the dustup surrounding their Bush-bashing remark of three years ago. On ''The Long Way Around,'' the opening salvo from Taking the Long Way, Natalie Maines recalls the time she ''fought with a stranger'' (Toby Keith?) and admits, ''I could have made it easier on myself.'' The next tune, ''Easy Silence,'' finds her searching for refuge in a world where ''anger plays on every station.'' If you wonder whether they have regrets about the Incident, ''Not Ready to Make Nice'' makes it clear they don't. When Maines gets to the part about all the death threats, her voice rises and the strings well up; it's a true pop-money-shot moment.\n\nThose first songs also demonstrate the Chicks aren't terribly interested in reconciling with red-state country fans. (On ''The Long Way Around,'' Maines cattily sings that her teen friends married their school beaus and now reside ''in the same ZIP codes where their parents live.'' Take that, CMT viewers!) But it's also apparent that the Chicks are thinking outside the Nashville box in more ways than writing defensive lyrics. The album, produced by the ubiquitous Rick Rubin, is a little bit country, a little bit rock & roll -- but also a little bit power balladry, alt-country, and roadhouse boogie. Along with the comments that got them into their recent mess, it's the least wimpy thing the group's ever done.\n\nFor that, you can also thank a guest roster that makes the album feel like a support-the-Chicks rally. With Neil Finn, they come up with ''Silent House,'' a lovely downer that brings out the best in the trio's layered harmonies; Gary Louris' input gives ''Everybody Knows'' the rainy-day jangle of a song by his band the Jayhawks. The Chicks are unabashedly, gloriously pop on ''Voice Inside My Head,'' penned with unlikely collaborators Dan Wilson (Semisonic) and Linda Perry (Christina Aguilera). Everyone from Bonnie Raitt to John Mayer also pops up, yet the record rarely sounds like an overcrowded party. With Maines projecting more passionately than ever, Taking the Long Way remains intimate and personal; perhaps she should tick people off more often.\n\nThe album also rectifies something that's long been confounding about the Dixie Chicks. For all their feistiness and rebel-yell image, their records have been comparatively meek -- the work of coffeehouse folkies rather than outlaw-country bad girls. On Taking the Long Way, most of that dichotomy vanishes along with quaint mandolin solos. Finally, they put their music where their opinionated mouths are.";Every song on this CD pleases my ears !!!
481;600.0;5.0;14.0;"Always pretty much of a fan of these women, I found it to be my patriotic duty to purchase this CD. Probably would have bought it anyway, but circumstances made it imperative. Can anyone listen to ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" and not feel the tears welling when she goes through the longest of lyrical phrases? Kudos to these women for ""staying the course."" Missed the concert in D.C. 'cause of travel. Keep it up, ladies...";Solidified by the idiotic right
513;601.0;4.0;14.0;"There's been so much written about politics in some reviews, so I'll try to just review the album:\n\nAbout six or seven years ago, Dixie Chicks was the group that made me open up my eyes (or ears) to country music, after I heard them on Sheryl Crow's live album. On this, their latest album, the sound is different from that on ""Wide Open Spaces"" and ""Fly"". It's less country and a bit more rock.\n\nThere are some excellent songs here. All the first five songs are very good. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""Everybody Knows"" stand out as excellent. ""Lullaby"" is what its title implies. It's slow and it is almost six minutes long, which makes it too much and too long of an interruption in the album's pace. This song would have been better placed at the end of the album. There are some weaker songs on the second half of the album, but no bad ones.\n\nThe group has evolved. This album sounds less coutnry and more rock than ""Wide Open Spaces and ""Fly"". Which sound you prefer is a matter of taste, I suppose. Personally, I like both. I think most Dixie Chicks fans will like this album, as well as others who aren't normally fans of country music.\n\n4 stars out of 5.";Dixie Chicks are back, with a new sound.
535;602.0;5.0;14.0;"Oh My God, what a great album. Highly Listenable. The Song Lullaby (featured in tv show ""Medium)is so beautiful, and gentle, and full of love. I can't get enough of this album, and they still have a fan for life. I can't stop humming these songs.";The Best Album of '06
595;603.0;5.0;14.0;I love this album.  The Chicks say they're leaving Country Music.  Well, country left Country Music a long time ago and the crap that's out there now isn't worth listening to.  The Dixie Chicks are too good for Country Music.  Their fans will follow where they go and that's where I'll be too.;Don't need country
609;604.0;5.0;14.0;I have loved every one of the Dixie Chicks' albums so I bought this one the week it came out and I was not disappointed.  Just forget about all of the political stuff and buy the album because it is great music with some very moving songs.  I love every song on this album, especially Not Ready To Make Nice because it is a powerful song that connects with me, not because it is making some kind of statement.  The only song I'm not crazy about is Lubbock or Leave It, but it is a nice change of pace from the slower songs.  Just buy the freaking album because you like the Dixie Chicks and leave everything else out of it!;Another great Dixie Chicks album & forget about all that political stuff!
634;605.0;5.0;14.0;"This album has all the hallmarks of a classic. Watch for a huge night at the Grammys. The Chicks demonstrate that they are a SuperGroup of the best sort.\n\nHere, they integrate the rich tradition of country and bluegrass into the mainstream. They do it with a thoughtfulness and depth that will make ""Taking The Long Way"" as relevant in 20 years as it is today.\n\nThe ladies branch out into new styles of music, without leaving the distinctive three-part harmony, fiddle and banjo that's their trademark. Country-inspired, certainly, but this album shows a mastery of many musical styles.\n\nRecall Lauren Hill's triumph on ""The Miseducation of Lauren Hill,"" on which she proved that her performance genious was not limited to a certain form of music. She tackled a diverse range of styles on a single album, and won multiple Grammy's for it.\n\nPerhaps the highlight of this work - and there are so many to choose from - is the lyrics.  After listening to this album 10-15 times, I still hear something new every time.\n\nIn a word, this album is a landmark, on par with some of the all-time great albums in contemporary music.";Natural Evolution for a SuperGroup
655;606.0;5.0;14.0;"I love the new Dixie Chick's CD ""Taking the Long Way"", but was really annoyed that I couldn't play it on my MAC so I could put it on my ipod. I know it's not totally the Dixie Chick's fault, but it is really rotten that their record company Columbia Records is encoding their CD's this way!\n\nI purchased this CD legally and wasn't going to copy it! I just want to listen to it while working on my computer and on my ipod and feel since I paid for it I should be able to do so!";"Love ""Taking the Long Way"", but beware of Columbia Records!!!"

665;609.0;5.0;14.0;I can't believe I bought Taking the Long Way off of AMAZON just because they had a clip.  I watched the clip and was taken.  Of course I was taken the first time while seeing them on their FLY tour.  They are entertainers.  They engaged me during that concert and they've never let go of my heart.  I admit I bought the second Fly CD just because I wanted to support them.  I will buy more Taking The Long Way to pass around JUST BECAUSE...  I love them and agree with what Natalie said about W.  This is a great CD, too!;Sweet Sound
699;610.0;3.0;14.0;I heard some of the new music the other day as background music during the season ending episode of one of my favorite TV shows, Medium, (I think). The tune was very good.\n\nWill I buy it? No, not ever.\n\nNatalie is entitled to her opinions. I'm entitled to mine.\n\nHer disrespect towards the President can not let me enjoy them or their music any longer.;I like the music but .....
707;611.0;5.0;14.0;"I am far from a country music fan, but my wife bought this CD and I love it. When I heard the lyrics to ""not ready to make nice"" I thought, good for her!  It was refreshing for her to stand her ground. So many people are retreating from their true opinions because of public shaming and wind up apologizing because their agent says it will be better for your image. Agree with her or not, I give her credit for ""I m not ready to make nice"". Oh, by the way, the music is fantastic.";Good for them!
714;612.0;5.0;14.0;I have been a long time fan, however I am more proud of them now than EVER!!!! I LOVE the CD, too. A different sound from the girls. Natalie has one of the strongest voices in music, not just country. Awesome band that is changing history. I highly recommend this album.;I love it.
729;613.0;5.0;14.0;"Admittedly I bought this CD to support ""free speech"" and these courageous young women, and I am happy to say that I love their music.  There's not a bad song on this CD.\n\nMy favorite song is ""I Hope"".  It's a wonderful combination of beat, lyrics and guitar playing.  Other 2 favorites are almost mantras for me, ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" and ""Taking the Long Way"".  If Natalie's heartfelt voice and these lyrics don't touch people's hearts, I have no hope for them.\n\nI wish I could thank the Dixie Chicks personally for saying so beautifully, what so many people are thinking and feeling.  Way to go, DC!!!";"Bought my first  ""country""  CD"
742;614.0;5.0;14.0;"Only recently have I become interested in the Dixie Chicks' music; I only started paying attention after their anti-Bush comment (with which I wholeheartedly agree). I was disappointed that they issued an apology for that statement, but now I am very grateful that they have dispensed with that apology and made their politics known. George W. Bush has fairly earned the abuse he is taking from the Chicks, Neil Young and others. I am giving this CD 5 stars: 4+ for music and production (Rubins is brilliant as usual), and 5+ for their message. We need celebrities like the Chicks to make a noise about this awful president so people will wake up. So you few Bush-lovers still remaining out there: He is the worst President ever. Admit it. Support artists who take a stand. And oh yeah....the music is very good.";Warning: This review is political
761;615.0;5.0;14.0;"Transcendant isn't quite the word used to describe the album of three Texas girls giving lyric and melody to matters of the heart that any listener can comfortably relate to. So, a big yee-haw will have to suffice for the Dixie Chick's ""Taking The Long Way"". The CD kicks with their expected close harmonies and driving cross-over twangy rock. Whatever political image they unfortunately might have is indeed transcended by the raw and purely personal nature of the music which they make. You will feel this music and be grateful for your small circle of friends. Buy ""Taking The Long Way Home""!\n\nBilly Wayne";Enjoying The Chicks
763;616.0;5.0;14.0;ANOTHER REVIEWER SAID THAT THIS ALBUM SHOWED A MORE MATURE DIXIE CHICKS. THEY WERE RIGHT. THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL. EDGIER, MORE UPBEAT.

797;617.0;5.0;14.0;Remember Earl CountryRadio? He seemed like a good ol' boy, kinda goofy, not too bright, but big-hearted. Well, turns out he's downright nasty if any little gal gets--what's the word he used? Uppity.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks have made an excellent CD. Great rock-pop with wicked fiddle licks, gorgeous harmonies, hooks that you can't get out of your mind and don't want to. Great music that will grace the airwaves on a variety of radio station formats.\n\nAnd Earl? We should have seen it coming a long time ago. Turns out he's a missing person nobody missed at all.;Goodbye, Earl.
798;618.0;5.0;14.0;The deer-in-the-headlights conservatives who are giving these great artists crap because of one statement make me sick. Neil Young has been doing this stuff for years. Oh wait, he's a man.\n\nThis is a great CD. Fantastic collection of songs. Voice Inside My Head is beautiful. Lubbock or Leave It tells the truth about blocks in small towns filled with dilapidated buildings, each being a church. There is more to life than this.\n\nThese are courageous women and skilled musicians who are not going to be beaten down by searing conformity, and they talk about it in this album. I hope it premieres on top of the pop charts and stays there for a very long time. That way, the majority of our population can tell these small-minded, hate-filled idiots that they don't own the world.;Spectacular, Soulful Music
823;619.0;5.0;14.0;"The Dixie Chicks brought a lot of energy and fun to country music when they arrived on the scene.  Like the rest of us, they're changing because that's what people do.  I salute their musicianship, their ability to write and perform songs from any genre they choose and their desire to be themselves no matter what.\n\nI've read some of the other reviews posted and one in particular disgusted me beyond measure.  These are intelligent and talented women doing what they do best - making music.  Sure they sound much more sober, hate mail's one thing, death threats are another.  Unprincipled weasels would have changed what they're saying to keep the money flowing.  ""I Hope"" they continue to be ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" if that's what they want.  And if they continue to give us songs as beautiful as ""Lullaby"" I'll be on the wait list to get the CD from Amazon the day it's released as I was with this.";I Hope

Rock on Chicks-- keep speaking your beautiful minds!!";Never better
859;621.0;5.0;14.0;First and foremost, I have always been a fan of the Dixie Chicks. This album is excellent and shows how diverse they are and how their lives are changing and how their music has changed with them.

It is probably the best since last year's ""There's More Where That Came From"" - Lee Ann Womack and ""Dreamin' My Dreams""  - Patty Loveless.\n\n~Chris";The Best Yet
887;623.0;3.0;14.0;"There are a couple good tracks on here, I like ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""Favorite Year"".  The title track isn't bad either.\n\nUnfortunately, there just aren't any really catch songs, let alone masterpieces that made them famous like ""Wide Open Spaces"" or ""You Were Mine"".\n\nI fell in love with the Dixie Chicks for the hooks!  Call me superficial but I like to be entertained the first time I hear a song, not after 20 listens. These songs were slow moving. I got bored in the first 10 seconds of a lot of these songs.\n\nAnd I could care less what the Dixie Chicks say about Bush -- actually I happen to agree with them. I bought the album the day it came out partially as a political statement in support of their freedom of speech. Whether or not the songs were any good was secondary. I don't feel ripped off, but I am disappointed because I had such high expectations for this album. The Dixie Chicks have been -- and continue to be -- one of the highest quality country acts, and what I consider to be ""real country"" (although in this album they're dropping some of their country roots).\n\nThere are a few sonically annoying parts of this album, like when a bad riff is repeated twice. I also would have liked more traditional country instruments in some of the songs. It's clear they're not trying to conform anymore to what is expected of them as country artists. With tens of millions of records sold, I think they have the right to go in any direction they choose. Let's hope they get more co-writers for their next album though :) ... I think they're excellent musicians but maybe on their own they can't write as many hits as they could with a little help.";Not terrible, but disappointing
890;624.0;5.0;14.0;Folks, music is all that matters.  These girls are gonna survive.  I don't like when Pop music (Rock, Country or otherwise) takes a stance on a political issue as a whole.  Everyone should be entitled to their opinion.  Reba and Vince Gill obviously have their opinions.  I watched the CMA awards the past few years and I'm growing more distant to a form of music I always enjoyed.\n\nAlison Krauss and Dixie Chicks are my current favorites.;These girls will survive all!
915;625.0;5.0;14.0;Beautiful, beautiful. Now I know why why the Dixie Chicks are so BIG... their voices blend beautifully and their lyrics reach the soul. There isn't one song that is disappointing.

948;627.0;5.0;14.0;Is it defiant? You bet.  Is it smart and sassy? Of course. Is it the Dixie Chicks's best effort yet? Arguably.\n\nStepping boldly out of the country rock sound they're famous for, this one plays a lot more sophisticated and contemporary. All their hallmark sounds are here, but dressed up with a new sheen and sharp relevance. An engaging, enjoyable listen throughout, this one may actually win the group a broader spectrum of fans.\n\nWhile the redneck radio continues to ban their music, smarter folks will be picking them up with enthusiasm, especially given this album's subtext of true patriotism commingled with the pain and sacrifices of standing up for the freedoms you believe in.  It's great to hear from this group again, and one can only hope there's more where this came from.;The Best Chicks Yet
949;628.0;5.0;14.0;"They have gone to a whole new level! WOW!\n\n""I like it"" is a cool song!!\n\n""Not ready to make Nice"" another one of my faves.\n\nI really LOVE the whole thing!  I would write more but I have to get the kids off to school!  LOL";"GREAT!  Bought the ""ring tone"", 2 CD's and concert tickets!!"
963;629.0;5.0;14.0;"Remember that ""Home"" was recorded by the Chicks while they were feuding with their record label?  They once said that it was recorded for themselves and they didn't worry about things like song-length, thinking it may never be released anyway. That attitude allowed them to create one of the most original, beautiful albums ever released in country or pop music. I believe that experience prepared them for this album.\n\nMy biggest concern was that if they moved too far from their country roots, it would become a Natalie solo album with banjo, fiddle and harmonies added as an afterthought.  I should have known the Chicks would surprise me once again. This is TRULY a group effort. And what an album it is.  I never thought they could equal ""Home"", but they have done that. It seems to get better each time through.  Anyone who lets his/her politics prevent them from enjoying this album is missing quite a treat.  Just buy it! You won't be disappointed.";Amazing Group Effort
968;630.0;5.0;14.0;"This is an AMAZING album! I'm usually not a big fan of country music because of the stereotypical Tobey Keiths and the redneck mentality but the courage and spirit of the Dixie Chicks back in 2003 made me give their music a listen. And I loved what I heard back in 2003 and I'm LOVING what I'm hearing now.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' music has been ENHANCED by Natalie Maines giving voice to their political opinions. As I listen to her sing ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", the American Spirit SOARS!! I thrill for these powerful women and am in awe of the lesson in American democracy that they are modeling for all Americans. More than that, it is refreshing that these women have the musical talent to back up the balls they so courageously display! I recommend this album to everyone who will listen!!!";I'm a new fan of Dixie Chicks!
978;631.0;5.0;14.0;"Having been burned and spurned by the short-sighted, politically ultra-conservative country music establishment because one of their own engaged in Bushwhacking, the Dixie Chicks have re-emerged into the light of day for the first time since their late 2003 ""Top Of The World"" CD with an album that is as tough an album as any C&W-influenced group has released in recent decades, TAKING THE LONG WAY.  And aided and abetted by maverick producer Rick Rubin and a cadre of great Los Angeles session musicians, they've made this album without compromise to what Music Row thinks is ""politically correct.""\n\nIndeed, this album finds the Chicks in the West Coast offense mode, with a sound and approach that echoes the best music made in Los Angeles between 1965 and 1982, when the traditional spirit of country and folk music were shaping what would be the city's sound during that time via bands like the Byrds, Poco, the Eagles--bands that Nashville pretenders like Rascal Flatts and Lonestar only WISH they could be.  Natalie's lead vocals are as powerful and robust as ever, as are the sharp instrumental capabilities and harmonies of Emily and Martie (witness Emily's precise banjo on ""Lubbick Or Leave It"", and her sitar on ""Voices Inside My Head"").  And with each of the fourteen songs written at least in part by all three Texas ladies, the album touches on all they've experience in the three years between their last studio album (the bluegrass album HOME) and now, including the births of children, the personal trauma of Alzheimer's, the horrors of Hurricane Katrina (""I Hope"") and, yes, even the Bushwhacking incident, which resulted in Natalie being threatened with death in Dallas during their ""Top Of The World"" tour.  ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", which tackles the outrageously overblown reaction to Natalie's anti-Bush remarks, is by far one of the most vicious songs of its kind since Bob Dylan's 1965 classic ""Positively 4th Street"", but the rage within is deeply felt and totally justified.\n\nAlongside the Chicks, Rubin has assembled a literal syndicate of players (including Bonnie Raitt; Gary Louris of the Jayhawks; Marvin Etzioni of Lone Justice; and Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers) who have worked with some of the greatest names in country and rock (Linda Ronstadt; Maria McKee; Emmylou Harris; Rosanne Cash; Sheryl Crow; Tift Merritt).  The after-effects of their Bushwhacking will obviously continue to infuriate the far-right, but that's not the Chicks' problem.  They have nothing to apologize for in what they've done on this masterful album, and they'll let the chips fall where they may.  For people who appreciate something more than the safe and P.C. Nashville schtick, this album is an absolute MUST.";The Chicks In West Coast Offense Mode
980;632.0;5.0;14.0;Yes, I've listened to the Dixie Chicks in the past, behind closed doors, through earphones so no one would hear, but today I am PROUD to call myself a Dixie Chicks fan.  The album is different than the ones of the past, but still wonderful.  There are always the whiners who dislike the appearance of change.  That's fine, but they need to get past that to allow themselves to appreciate the beauty and the artistry of this album.  I was very pleased to see that this album has an average of 5 starts, not counting, of course, the people who did not review the quality of the album, but their contrasting political views.  It is everyone's patriotic duty to buy this album.  Loyalty to the country, always.  Loyalty to the government, when they deserve it.;I'm a fan now
989;633.0;5.0;14.0;"""Not Ready"" is a killer first single - catchy, well written, thought provoking.  Looking forward to the rest of the album.  I give it 5 stars based on the first single alone - it's well worth the cost of the album.  It's also great to support people who have been vocal critics of America's disgraceful, functionally illiterate, war mongering, serial lying, illegal spying, anti-American POS pResident.  Thanks for keeping it real, ladies.";Righteous
1004;634.0;5.0;14.0;Strong, heartfelt lead vocals. Beautiful harmonies. Exceptional craftsmanship. Been waiting a long time, and was not disappointed on any front.;what's not too like?
1006;635.0;5.0;14.0;This is a great album with and without the political controversy.  Personally, I am thrilled to hear various artists speaking out against the current administration FREELY while sharing their art with the world.  I support freedom of speech whether I happen to agree with the sentiment or not.  The only traitor in this particular equation is a citizen who engages in activities such as promoting censorship and spying on American citizens without a court order.  Political issues aside the music on this album is quality and SHOULD be shared on the air waves for our enjoyment.  I'd prefer to use my radio dial to dictate what I hear on the radio, not the music industry itself.;Fantastic album, does not disappoint!
34;636.0;4.0;13.0;"I can't pretend I like country music. I am not a fan of country music. The music I am into is anything but mainstream. I do though like Johnny Cash, Kasey Chambers, and early Mary Chapin Carpenter. When the Dixie Chicks first came out several years ago, I didn't really blick an eye and pay any attention to the women. Their music was a bit too twangy for my tastes.\n\nI recently decided to give the the Chicks a chance after their sweep at this year's Grammys did my curiousity got the better of me so I went with their latest album TAKING THE LONG WAY. I always did like the first single ""Not Ready to Make Nice"". The song itself is an obvious response at the controversy over what Natalie Maines said a few years ago. Her obvious anger from the death threats she and her bandmates (and their families) received resulted in what I think is one of the band's strongest and most compelling songs ever.\n\nI have to be honest I did not have any expectations when I acquired a copy of TAKING THE LONG WAY but much to my surprise, I found myself enjoying the cd immensely. I liked the harmonizing that goes on through out the album between the Robison sisters Emily and Martie, and Natalie Maines. The songwriting is strong. It is obvious that the songs were written from personal experiences from having children to the controversy over Natalie's comments. There were a couple of songs that I did not care for simply because I didn't like the melodies and they were too twangy.\n\nUber producer Rick Rubin certainly leaves an imprint on the album by creating an intimate, personal sound on this album. The band's collaborations with local MN singer/songwriters Dan Wilson, Gary Louris as well as national artists like Sheryl Crow and Keb 'Mo certainly helped the women's lyrics evolve into something more personal and less goofy like ""Goodbye Earl"".\n\nThere are very few albums where I am willing to take a chance on with no expecations, and end up enjoying the music. I am glad I took the risk on TAKING THE LONG WAY. The results was very satisfying for me.";A pleasant surprise
75;637.0;5.0;13.0;"The sisters' mom is a classical violinist.  A goal attributed to them was to elevate 'country music' to the level of respect that classical music holds.  With this release I think they have met that goal.  What an amazing collection of performances, with such depth of feeling, and personal expression.  The quality of musicianship is a high as anything I have found in the classical music (where I spend most of my time, BTW).\n\nI'm not a country music fan by nature, but I am a huge fan of this music and these performers.  If you were to ask me what music has most strongly moved me to tears over the past couple months it would be live performances of the Houston Symphony of the Bruckner 8th Symphony, the Brahms German Requiem, and some of the songs on this release.\n\nBravo.\n\n--George\n\np.s. I recommend the documentary ""Shut Up and Sing"", too.";One of Their Goals Has Been Achieved
89;638.0;5.0;13.0;The Dixie Chicks are in a special league of their own and this album shows how incredibly resilient and creative they can be.  I love it!  As someone said earlier, it's an album that grows on you.  The more you play it the more you want to play it.  You go girls!  I was also tickled that they won the Grammy after I bought the album.  Yes;Outstanding
103;639.0;4.0;13.0;I bought this album because it won some Grammy's.  I'd never listened to the Chicks before, and never liked country music.  That's changed.  This album is terrific. From the opening notes on Taking the Long Way (the first track) until the end of the album the Dixie Chicks' soaring melodies and intelligent lyrics deliver the goods.\n\nDon't let a 'Country Music' or political label scare you away from buying this. This is an excellent album for anyone that likes to listen to good music.;I Don't Like the Chicks, but I LOVE this Album (4.5 Stars)
113;640.0;5.0;13.0;The sound and energy on this latest Dixie Chicks CD is overwhelming!\nI keep listening to it on my car sound system and it seems that it is so much fun & enjoyable that I can't imagine it becoming played out.;The latest Dixie Chicks CD is huge!!
119;641.0;3.0;13.0;2 1/2 Stars...\n\nFirst off, before I get flamed for being something I'm not, I'm on the Chicks side.  They should be able to speak freely without having to succumb to the ridiculous backlash that followed, and I sincerely applaud them for their stength in the face of adversity.  However, am I missing something here?  A Grammy sweep?  My best guess was that this choice was based on the relatively weak group of nominees this year.  Yes, this is definitely superior to the likes of James Blunt, but there were some significant, innovative works released this year by artists whose views are in line with the Dixie Chicks, and my own.  This album is a pleasant listen, but to me, it's nothing more.  I didn't think the first single was listenable at all, and yet it won song of the year, and record of the year?  So, are people going to tag me as unhelpful because my opinion of the music is different than theirs?  I thought the rest of the album was pleasant, nothing more.  It's certainly not innovating, and not much different from whatever else is on the Alt. Country airwaves.  I admire them for writing their own material as well, but so do lots of other talented, aspiring artists.  The Grammy sweep reminded me a little bit of Norah Jones, enjoyable, but not exceptional.  The Dixie Chicks should be applauded for their stance, but not deified for it, when Springsteen, Steve Earle, Eddie Vedder, and even Mellencamp have been doing it for years.  I agree with the political stances taken, but at the same time I am beginning to worry about the trendiness of the political situation.  Before you know it, Paris Hilton is going to record a political album, just because its the fashionable thing to do at the moment.  I am not accusing the Dixie Chicks of jumping on this bandwagon at all, and they have been on the recieving end of over the top, and unwarranted abuse for their beliefs.  However, it is dangerous for people to take advantage of a political situation for personal gain.  Stand up for your own deeply held beliefs, not just because it's the hip thing to do.\n\nAt the same time, are people going to rate me as uncontributive because I hold this album in a different view than them?  That would be ironically similar to attacking someone's art because you disagree with their political beliefs, in my opinion, although obviously not on the same level.;Am I missing something???
134;642.0;5.0;13.0;Forget about the politics. If you're into good music, this is definitely one album you should buy. I'm not into most country music, but this one is more rock than country.;Worth 10 bucks and more....
137;643.0;5.0;13.0;I didn't like Country at all until the Dixie Chicks came along.  I never went to concerts.  I have been to three Chicks concerts and they are amazing talented women.  I was so upset by the controversy because I don't want some people's opinions and politics to stop their music.  I have never seen such a concerted effort to try to hurt someone.  I was appalled that their friends in the entertainment business did not stand up for them.  Their music is great and I wish people would just lighten up and get over it.  Please stay together and keep producing the songs...they are great!;GRAMMY WINNERS - GREAT LIVE PERFORMANCES TOO
138;644.0;1.0;13.0;Bush bashers or not....this album's content is all about the Bush comment and backlash The Chicks received a few years ago.  If they really wanted to move on they would have stayed away from the topic in their music (at least for 98% of the album) but it is too redundant in this album.  Not their best work and I used to be a huge fan but they are losing me by the year!  Not worth the cash to buy this one.  Hopefully they will produce a more rounded album next.;No stars for this mess!

We've been waiting for you.\n\nThanks to you for reminding us what makes America great: Divergent views and the freedom to speak them.  What impresses me most about the Chicks is that they have come through a storm; did it together; and still are gracious enough to bless us with their wonderful music.  Thanks Chicks.\n\nThat said, the opening track ""The Long Way Around"" is classic up-tempo Chicks, leading listeners to dream of the what-ifs (as if I can honestly pretend that their lyric, ""Someday I'm gonna' settle down,"" still applies to me).  The Chicks' statement ""No I... I could never follow,"" says it all.\n\n""Easy Silence,"" I suspect is a heartfelt thanks to the family, friends, and fans that stood by the Chicks when they discovered that freedom is not free.\n\n""Not Ready to Make Nice,"" serves as the girl's answer to all those who would have them to be anything less than full, free, participating Americans.  And hey, I didn't necessarily agree with Natalie's controversial statements at the time, but I am proud of both her and the Chicks since.  It takes guts to speak your mind, take the heat, and above all, stick together when the fun hits the fan.  I have always admired the Chicks for being great musicians and having great fun, but now I admire them more for being great friends.\n\nDon't miss out on the soulful ""Lullaby,"" and its ""How long do you want to be loved?  Is forever enough?""\n\nThen give a listen to ""I Hope,"" yet another thought-provoking tune with the Chicks singing a choral backup.\n\nDisc 2.

Rubin is known for his eclectic collaborations with such artists as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run DMC, Neil Diamond, Johnny Cash and now the Chicks.  Five Grammy nominations for ""Taking the Long Way"" can't be wrong, can they?\n\nIn short:  the Dixie Chicks (and Mr. Rubin, thank you very much!) don't know how to fail.  They get an A.";Don't follow the Herd, Follow the Chicks...  (2 Disc set)
174;646.0;5.0;13.0;Taking The Long Way~ Dixie Chicks is yet another brilliant album release from  this astounding country trio. I have like this band since the early days and that hilarious Goodbye Earl. The chicks are very talented vocalists and their lyrics are well written to say the least.  The book-let is filled with amazing pictures and liner notes are very informative. The production value is crisp and this is one great album. I will definitely give this album 5 stars. Way to go Dixie Chicks!;Taking The Long Way
181;647.0;5.0;13.0;"I downloaded the album immediately when it was first available and pre-ordered my copy.  I absolutely love this album and it is easily their best overall.  I love songs from the other albums (Cowboy Take Me Away, Traveling Soldier, Earl, Wide Open Spaces, etc) but this album sends chills up my spine.  My Grandmother died of Alzheimer's disease 10 years ago and Silent House takes me back to her.  This album gets better and better each time I listen to it.  I applaud the Chicks for ""putting it all out there"" - I was a huge fan before the fallout and an even bigger fan after.";The Chicks are on fire
182;648.0;5.0;13.0;This is true country music at it's best...the Chicks have done it again.  I have been a huge fan of them and their music since the beginning, and as long as they keep making albums, I will keep buying them.;Loved it!
190;649.0;5.0;13.0;"Awesome CD.  But very different than previous CD from Dixie Chicks.  Shaped very much by the events over the last couple of years.  ""Not Ready to Make Nice' says it all.  And Natalie's voice is stronger than ever.";The chicks kick butt
201;650.0;1.0;13.0;I have been a long time fan, but..... I was very dismayed to hear what Natalie said in concert, overseas.  We pay entertainers to entertain us, not cram their political views down our throats as the only realistic, viable opinions.  The freedoms we have in this country come from a long line of soldiers that put on the uniform and stood up for what America stands for.  I saw them last week on the Oprah Winfrey show and as the song says, their not ready to make nice, granted the lyrics could be applied to many situations, but in this case we know what they refer too. They owe this country a big opology, and until I hear it, I won't buy their cd's anymore.;Entertain us, keep your political thoughts to yourself
208;651.0;1.0;13.0;I can't believe they ever won the Grammies that they have when I hear any of their recent albums.  I may not be the only one who thinks that they aren't any good anymore when you consider that they had to cancel a lot of their concerts on their last tour due to not selling enough tickets at many of them.  Save your money!;Save your money
220;652.0;4.0;13.0;This is a review of the album, regardless of what the chicks have said in the past.  The album is solid.  It's a great buy, and there's a reason it's selling so well.  Bravo to the chicks.  A fantastic record.  Very driven, and musically strong.  Natalie's voice has really grown.;Why apologize if you're not sorry?  That would be lying.
237;653.0;5.0;13.0;The product was easy to find.  I like the ability to listen to tracks before purchasing.  The CD came right on time and in perfect condition.  I will not hesitate to buy CDs from this seller through Amazon again.;Long Way Home CD Purchase
244;654.0;5.0;13.0;The Dixie Chicks blend together country, blues, pop and rock into a must have CD.  I love all the songs, not just 2 or 3.  Shows a lot of maturity and growth.  Great price, awesome CD!;Dixie Chicks Best CD Yet!
254;655.0;3.0;13.0;Typical Dixie Chicks -- easy to listen to but nothing outstanding in this one.  I listened to it once -- now it's sitting on a shelf.;Dixie Chicks -- Losing The Edge?
259;656.0;4.0;13.0;It's not only ever about love, loss and hard times with these chicks.  Their lyrics are much more profound than that...they make you think while you tap your feet to great rhythms and listen to the beautiful harmonies these ladies put out.  Their band is solid. We are growing up with the chicks now, as parents, responsible citizens, spouses (sure there are love songs), children.  They write from the heart.;Rockin with Integrity
265;657.0;4.0;13.0;"I'll admit that the Dixie Chicks caught me by surprise with this album. Like everyone else on the planet, I had been subjected to the band's press about how country radio wouldn't support the Chicks, and how right-wing knuckleheads scorned them for their remarks about Bush. Worst of all, I saw the repellently pretentious video for ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" before hearing this. This did not predispose me to liking this project.\n\nBut none of that matters now, because it turns out that this is a pretty darned good album. As a matter of fact, its first track, ""The Long Way Around,"" may be the band's best single ever. And the rest of the CD has got some terrific balance, from folky bluegrass to pop-rock to pop-country. There's the headlong, hard-rockin' sarcasm of ""Lubbock or Leave It"" juxtaposed with the perfect ballad for high schoolers to get weepy over at graduation, the Sheryl Crow-penned ""Favorite Year.""\n\nSure, let's give credit where it's due: producer Rick Rubin has the Midas touch for bringing out the best of artists, and there are lots of big names helping to write the songs (Neil Finn and Mike Campbell among them). And this assembled team helps make this unlikely CD the best one of the Dixie Chicks' career. ""I Like It""!";It's Not Really Country, But It Is Really Good
295;658.0;5.0;13.0;I don't have to agree with them to respect the fact that they won't back down just because they made an unpopular decision.

Not only have they helped boot country to become the likeable country-rock that it is today, the trio have won numerous awards, garnered huge critical acclaim and sell millions and millions of records.  But how does their latest offering, the extremely personal Taking The Long Way, come up against its predecessors?  Pretty darn good, actually.  Though its serious overtones may be a little depressing at first (since the Chicks are typically known for upbeat, energetic tunes), the record is also the most personal of the Chicks' career, addressing many topics (including the infamous anti-Bush statement) with hit songs like ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" the highlight of Taking The Long Way.  There are some faster songs here, like opener ""The Long Way Around"" and ""Voices Inside My Head.""

347;664.0;5.0;13.0;"This CD is in one word- excellent. The song-writing is superb. The range of music is wonderful from the tender ""Easy Silence"", and sweet ""Lullaby"", to the raw ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", and the soulful ""I Hope"". Clearly written from the heart, the music on this CD is a blend of brazen honesty, rawness, and sweet tenderness, and it's all really good stuff. Unlike a lot of CDs which might have one or two good songs, this has a CD-full, and it's well worth the cash. A must-have for any music lover and a great gift for a friend.

402;668.0;5.0;13.0;"If you are only interested in the free hearted tunes like ""Goodbye Earl"" this might not be the CD for you. The Chicks have come through a trying time in their careers and lives and their music reflects it. The passion and conviction in some of these songs are downright gripping. I have enjoyed everything they have put out to date and this CD surely didn't disappoint. They have grown tremendously as people and as artists. These songs touch on a lot of topics that most musicians steer clear of. The references to in vitro fertilization and bouts of Alzheimer's are snippets of their personal and family experiences. They didn't shy away from sharing their own realities with their listeners. Many people will choose to buy (or not to buy) this CD because of political fallout...they won't be disappointed. Whether I agree with their opinions or not, I applaud their steadfastness in their position. For me, it is not about the politics...it's all about the MUSIC. This CD doesn't have the same happy go lucky fiddle many Chicks fans are accustomed to, but it is still there and this has the best harmonies they have done to date! I highly recommend it!!!";Definitely different...but change can be good.

I went out and bought a few of their CDs after that, and found that their diversity transcends the country genre.  Home was their best work, until Taking the Long Way was released.  I have listened to it again and again, and have bought copies for both of my daughters and a few of my friends as well.  I find it inspiring, not only for the strong, true statements in their lyrics, but for the musical artistry.  Absolutely outstanding.";Simply superb!

This album is the perfect mix of Country, Pop and Folk. This is the best album they have made yet!";Super Album
438;672.0;5.0;13.0;I originally bought the album because I wanted to support the Dixie Chicks after they received such outrageously un-American treatment following Natalie Maines' anti-Bush comment several years ago.

And I agree with the people who say that those who oppose them have as much right as Maines had to say her thing.  I mean, yes!!!

Unfortunatly, the rest of the CD isn't like it, more country-ish.  I'm trying to branch out and listen to other genres of music.  And a few of the other songs are not too bad.  But it isn't really my type.";"5 Stars for ""Not Ready to Make Nice"""
636;679.0;5.0;13.0;This cd is awesome, plain and simple.  People need to get over political grudges and enjoy this truely great music.  Unless your happy with music that isn't too good but by artists you agree with on political issues, you should buy this album or atleast buy some of the songs on it through Itunes.  Silent House, a song about Alzheimers, is currently my favorite on the album, but it's all a very close race.  You won't regret getting this cd. If you are a true music fan, you can ignore their personal beliefs and enjoy this music.;Taking the right way..

669;681.0;5.0;13.0;What a great way for these three true patriots to get back at their small-minded, anti-free speech critics!  I would have bought the album just to support their rights of expression, but the great music and beautiful messages are a bonus for this long time fan!  Bravo, Chicks!!!!;Natalie Was Right!!
683;682.0;5.0;13.0;This album is a great one!! I will alway continue to support them, they are great musicians and entertainers...Why is it that because a female made a comment about the president it turned into this HUGE issue?  Why is it that she said what we were all thinking? A lot of men and women have said many NEGATIVE comments about the president, and a lot of musicians have also said many, many negative remarks about this world, the president, other musicians, etc..., i could go on and on,  but because it was the Dixie Chicks it blew up at them???  What ever happened to Freedom of speech?  Dixie Chicks, keep up the good work!!!!;Fan 4-ever of the chicks!!!
685;683.0;5.0;13.0;This is the first time I bought a Dixie Chicks album,I've never really been intrested in Country music,but after listening to them I just loved it.;Love It
686;684.0;5.0;13.0;People keep saying they don't sound country any more. Whatever they sound like, I love it! I really do. It's some terrific stuff. They don't need the South any more to sell records. They're mainstream. Don't listen to me, or anyone else. Listen to their album and judge for yourself.;The Dixie Chickies
687;685.0;1.0;13.0;"While talented musicians, the Dixie Chicks need to stick to country and stop trying to crossover to pop.  This is their attempt to ""dis"" their country audience...  Poor attempt at that...UGH.";Poor Attempt at Pop
719;686.0;5.0;13.0;i originally bought this cd online, but with all the reviews here on amazon...i went ahead to towerrecords to pick up an additional copy...and almost all the copies of 'taking the long way' were SOLD OUT!!!  no joke!!!  but this is great mix of country, bluegrass, rock and of course dc classic ballads.  the best song in my opinion is 'not ready to make nice'...it has an electricifying string bridge to the song and you can feel natalie's emotions with lyrics like 'i've paid a price, and i'll keep payin', i'm not ready to make nice and i'm not ready to back down and i'm still mad as hell...'  i've liked them ever since wide open spaces, but this album is by far the best written and definitely more personal than all of their other albums...and it's no surprise to me that this album debuted @ #1 on the billboard hot 200 AND @ #1 on the country album charts!!  looks like toby keith will have to find another line of work!  great work ladies!!;stunning album!!!
733;687.0;5.0;13.0;Ya know, I've always had a rather fondness for them chicks, but I done never ever purchased a cd of theirs. This is a mighty fine piece a music.  That Natalie Maines has got some voice on her and their lyrics actually say something.  They ain't shy that's for sure and we need more BRAVE, COURAGEOUS people out there like Miss Maines.  Our president, if that's what you'd call him, should try and give it a listen.;BEST BROADS
734;688.0;5.0;13.0;Every track is incredible! I love the new sound! I bought two cd's, one for the car and one for the house. Watched the 60 Minutes interview and ordered the cd the next day. Natalie kicks....! This is my new favorite cd! I could write endless praises of just how good it is.....it is their Best.... just buy it! Thanks for the music!;Natalie Rocks...... and her music does too!
760;689.0;5.0;13.0;This album is a breakthrough at least in my eyes. They have definately come back to stay. Ever since their disagreement with the competency of the President they have stayed low, but now they are back doing what the love, and thats singing. I defintately would recommend this album for its heartfelt lyrics and Dixie Chick attitude. It is a great addition to any music fans collection.;Their Best CD Yet!!

780;691.0;5.0;13.0;The CHICKS are back and BETTER than ever, delivering no apologies for their freedom to speak. They are back more mature, more outspoken, and without the following of rednecks that are bible thumbing, cousin-humping fans that now hate them. WHO NEEDS YA! Thank you DIXIE CHICKS for your amazing new album. I cannot wait to see your concert, and it's been a long time gone.;A long time gone..
786;692.0;5.0;13.0;THE DIXIE CHICKS ARE THE BEST GROUP OF ALL TIME (except, maybe, for the International Submarine Band) AND THIS IS THE BEST CD OF ALL TIME!  THIS CD IS BETTER THAN SEX!  THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE ONE STAR OR THREE STARS OR EVEN FOUR STARS INSTEAD OF FIVE MUST BE PART OF THE BUSH/BIG OIL/ZIONIST CONSPIRACY THAT BLEW UP THE WORLD TRADE CENTER JUST TO MAKE MUSLIMS LOOK BAD! THIS CD IS SO GOOD YOU WILL WANT TO LISTEN TO IT 24/7! QUIT YOUR JOB IF THEY DON'T LET YOU LISTEN TO IT ALL DAY AT WORK! IT IS SO GOOD! IT IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME! MEN, YOU WON'T NEED VIAGRA ANYMORE, JUST LISTEN TO THIS CD! WOW! I CAN'T BELIEVE MUSIC CAN BE THIS GOOD! AM I DREAMING?;Buy this CD! Buy two of Them! BUY A ZILLION OF THEM!
796;693.0;5.0;13.0;"After what seems like a never ending wait, ""Taking the Long Way"" is finally here.  I absolutely love the Chicks but I was worried that after all the controversary the CD would not hold up like their previous releases.  Was I ever wrong!  This CD is typical Chicks!  Absolutely fabulous.  The songwriting is great, the melodies are great, the music is great.  Rock on Chicks!";Dixie Chicks Do It Again!!
800;694.0;5.0;13.0;Hoopla aside, the Dixie Chicks continue to grow as a band.  A fan of the Chicks since their bluegrass days, I am pleased to hear Natalie's voice maturing to approach the virtuosity of Martie and Emily.  Give this album a chance, and I think you'll find it worth your time.;A new turn for the Chicks
816;695.0;5.0;13.0;"On my first listening last night I was impressed by the changes in style they had made without sacrificing the certain Dixie Chick sound I like. The songs have more variety and more originality. Contrary to other reviewers ideas I heard less whining over lost loves than on previous lockstep ""Country"" albums.  I heard more maturity in the writing.  All the songs are good but I found ""Everybody Knows"" especially lyrical and enchanting. I'm glad I bought the album.";Welcome Change

900;697.0;5.0;13.0;"I don't care for the Dixie Chicks politics, but I do like their music.  After hearing ""Lullaby"" while watching t.v. the other night, I decided that this CD is a must have.  Lullaby is absolutely beautiful and I'm sure the rest of the album will be equally good.";Lullaby is a beautiful song!
946;698.0;5.0;13.0;Other reviews here have said it all. Just remains to be said that after a long two-years of winter, summer has finally returned to American music. Welcome back, ladies.;State of the Art
955;699.0;5.0;13.0;"What a great record.  The Dixie Chicks and producer Rick Rubin have found a perfect balance of the Indigo Girls and the Bangles... without losing their own sound.  Each Chicks album shows more depth and maturity...like John Mellencamp.  Maybe ClearChannel won't play them...and maybe they'll be bannished from the Country community.  It doesn't seem to be hurting them that much...they're playing the Garden in August.  Of course, I'd rather see them at Joe's Pub, so maybe I'd rather they not do so well; but I have a feeling they'll do just fine as long as they keep producing great music like this.";Integrity
962;700.0;5.0;13.0;Lullaby made me cry! So did Easy Silence. Lubbock or Leave it rocks!  Martie and Emily rip up the strings and Natalie as always, takes you on a journey of emotion with that voice. Best work yet!!!;I Love It!!
969;701.0;5.0;13.0;"Listened to one cut on a media site, and hurried here to buy the album (and I'm not even a country fan). This is simply amazing music. The power and passion of Maine's performance is incredible.\n\nThis album is worth 10X the price just for the stunning musicality. The fact that it also annoys the slack-jawed, mouth-breathing stooges who think having the courage to speak truth to power should be punished is just a little added bonus.\n\n""I'm not ready to make nice"" should become an anthem of the movement to reject the ghastly things that have happened to our country! BUY THIS ALBUM! Whatever your politics.";Simply Amazing ...
993;702.0;5.0;13.0;In an era of cookie cutter pop and country, it's nice to have some actual talent present on a CD. If you've liked the Chicks in the past, you'll like this disc too. If you're not familiar with their work, try some samples from the links above. I think you'll like what you hear.;Just good music
994;703.0;5.0;13.0;This cd reminds me of how the chicks can still manage to put any girl back to the country. I bought the cd today and the whole thing is amazing. I don't think it is as good as thier others however it is still worth every dollar spent. They traded thier boots for heals but they coninue to stand out with a unique sound and write lyrics that are honest and original. I don't care what she said about bush. Lots of celebrities speak out against him but few were as criticized as them. and besides everyone says something they regret and nobidy is perfect. we fight for the right for everybody to have freedom of speech. buying this cd doesn't make me anti-american. being against freedom of speech might.;"""Not ready to make nice"""
1005;704.0;5.0;13.0;Yes, politically the Chicks and I are on the same page.  Even so, I was surprised how much this collection of music caught me in my heart.  For any adult living through or surviving the passing of a parent, Silent House will express what you've felt but probably were not able to put into your own words.  And how many of us from small towns who paved a new road will hear part of our story in The Long Way Around?  More than the Chicks will ever know.  Finally, as I look at the news and think of the world my adult counterparts are creating for my son and his generation I, too, hope.  To me, growing up with the origins of country music playing on my parents' stero, listening to the Dixie Chicks is like going home with a more universal view of the world.  I'm proud to be their fan and not just because I agree that the actions of our current presidential administration are (to say the least) embarrassing.  Because they are very talented woman with the good sense to share that talent whether the public is agreeing with them or not.;A voice of truth on many issues
40;705.0;5.0;12.0;"I find it unbelievable that the Dixie Chicks are still not played on country radio stations (on the Internet anyway).  Country musics' heart and soul is telling stories; sad, happy, and everything in between.  This album tells the 'story' of the Dixie Chicks in an awesome way.  It brings chills to hear how real their story is.  The way they have brought the emotion and challenges they faced out through their songs shows unbelievably talent and courage.\n\nAs far as still not being played goes, here in NZ we only know what we see on the news and as far as I can tell their are plenty of you Americans who have said and done a lot worse than what the Chicks ever said.  I think not playing them is very one-eyed and narrow minded.  You just have to look at some of country music's icons to see they have rebelled against the 'government.'  Willie, Waylon, Merle, Hank Williams Snr, just to name a few.\n\nGo the Chicks, I will always buy and play their music.\n\nKia ora";Dixie Chicks at their best
57;706.0;5.0;12.0;"It's been almost a year since I bought this cd and I am still listening to it and loving it.  It is by far the best cd I have ever heard.  There's a hint of country, but it is much more ""adult contemporary"" than any of their other records.  If you are considering getting this cd, don't hesitate!  The Chicks didn't win 5 grammys because people felt sorry for them...they won because this cd is outstanding!";best cd i ever bought
73;707.0;5.0;12.0;"This new album is amazing!  They sure showed everyone with their comeback.  Natalie:  Keep your mouth WIDE OPEN, I'm always listening!  Love it, love it, love it.  I can't get enough of this new album, especially ""Not Ready to Make Nice.""  I strongly recommend watching their DVD about the making of this album, it's called ""Shut up and Sing,"" it made me appreciate this album even more, which I already loved and admired.  Keep it up Dixie Chicks, you rock!!!";Go Dixie Chicks!!!
87;708.0;5.0;12.0;"I have been a fan of this group ever since the wide open spaces album! this has got to be the best album they have made and like all GREAT music it is from the heart! Like all GREAT country music it draws on their experiences and thoughts on what is happening in their lives and laying it bare for all to see!\n\nTo all those people who ""hate"" them because they dared to have an opinion all I can say is that if you weren't so intent on seeing ""your"" entertainers as robots who go on stage and sing for you, rather than human beings who may hold *Shock horror* a different opinion to you, you may actually wake up and realise that you don't own them and that to force another person to keep quiet is little more than nazism! your soldiers, dying for a false and illegal war I might add, are there because they believe they are fighting for democracy and freedom of speech. Just imagine their shock when they get back and realise your country has crucified 3 people for exercising their freedom of speech!\n\nSo all I can say is buy this album along with the new albums by Neil Young, Steve Earle, Bruce Springsteen and the mighty Kris Kristofferson and realise what freedom and free thought are all about. you may actually be able to think for yourselves.

117;710.0;1.0;12.0;"The grammy award given to the Dixie Chicks for this album is a clear slap in the face meant to belittle our President of the United States and Commander and Chief when we are at a time of war. Whether you believe in the cause or not, we have men and women making sacrifices for this country and betraying them with this sanctimonious award to the Dixie Chicks is typical of the ""Hate Our Country Left"".  I've been listening to country radio for a long time with alot different stations and I've never even heard one of these songs being played in my area of Texas.  These are talented ladies who should be recognized for their art and not for their hate.";A Slap in the Face
122;711.0;5.0;12.0;The Chicks have made good music all along, but this moves them into another league! What shouldn't be lost in all the political discussion about this CD is that this is important music!  Most great music is about something, and the deeply personal lyrics in these songs are not just about these women, but about this country.  What I love about this CD is how well the music (and Natalie's wonderful voice) have captured the emotion of America's struggle with War Politics (and perhaps how uncomfortable we still are as a society with women having strong opinions).\n\nWhen good music is about something important it can become Great Music.  I think the Chicks have gotten there.;Good to Great
131;712.0;5.0;12.0;"Good music is supposed to be about feelings -- the artist's expression of them as well as moving the listener.  As musical artists the Dixie Chicks have created an album that not only viscerally expresses their own emotions by moved me, the listener.  ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is one of my favorite songs ever now.  Whatever your politics are, there is no getting around that it is a powerful song.  Everyone at some point has felt like they are just not ready or able to kowtow to authority of some kind.  ""Silent House"" is a fantastically sad song about a grandparent's Alzheimers, ""So Hard"" about infertility and the feelings of failure that often come with it, ""Taking the Long Way"" a great song about sticking to your beliefs and solidarity among women, ""I Hope"" a hopeful plea for love and understanding post-Katrina, ""Lubbock or Leave It"" about some of teh hypocrisy of small towns, and ""Voice Inside My Head"" about regret over lost love and roads not taken.  While most of the songs are mid-tempo or ballads, the excellent quality of the lyrics makes up for any homogeneity in tempos.  I personally cannot wait, now that the Chicks have all the anger out of their systems, to hear what comes next now that they are writing more of their songs.  I saw them live this past summer and they were fantastic and will see them again when they come to a city near me.";My Fave CD of 2006

171;715.0;5.0;12.0;It has been a long time since I bought a CD and actually liked all the songs on it. A must add to your music collection. This easily makes it into my top 10 stranded on a deserted island CD's!  The writting is great, the music is great and their singing is perfect.  It's a little less country then previous albums but not so far off the beaten path that die hard fans won't enjoy it just as much.;So much more than I expected
192;716.0;5.0;12.0;Brilliant.\n\nI have listened to it over and over and cant get enough. I hope they trip down under to promote it.;One Word
197;717.0;5.0;12.0;"First, this CD is a nothing short, and I mean nothing short, of an absolute masterpiece. Fourteen perfect songs which range from political to love-torn to, most importantly, defiant at the redneck audience that abandanded their three precious ""little girls"" as soon as they grew up and started speaking for themselves.\n\nSecond, this is the most corageous stand I've ever seen ANY group or individual performer take EVER. Though they knew that they were risking their entire audience, the Chicks never backed down from Natalie's absolutely correct comments about the patheticness of George W. Bush and the misery and slaughter of our troops, not to mention everyone who got caught in the crossfire, this ""leader"" has caused. Yes, Bob Dylan and a hundred others have written great protest songs against the things in the world they saw as unjust. But they were preaching to the choir. Their audience was a protest audience. As for the Chicks, they put their careers and easy millions in continuous record sales on the line when they refused to ""make nice"" or ""Back down"" from their brave stance when their main audience are people who still believe we're ""winning the war in Iraq"" (934 of our soldiers died there last week. The war has been going on for almost three years now with no end in sight. Osama Bin Laden, five years after 9/11 is still free as a bird. Some ""Victory"", huh?)\n\nThe ONLY other performer I can compare to the Chicks in this bravery is Bill Jabanoski, whose main audience is also redneck Jimmy Buffett fans, but who nonetheless recorded ""A Special Place In Hell-Four Years Under The Bootheal of George W. Bush"" in September 2004 and not only risked his whole audience, but also gave ALL of his proceeds from that CD to the Kerry campaign to get Bush and Cheney and Rumsfield out of office. As a lot of people have written before me, we should have listened harder to his 2002 CD ""Florence Martus"" in which he basically predicted everything that Bush and company were going to do in Iraq and what a disaster it was going to be.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that Jabanoski, who toured with the Chicks on the campaign trail in 2004, has a song on his new CD ""Chase The Night Into The Dawn"" called ""F..K You Rednecks, I Love The Dixie Chicks"" and also rips apart ""Clear Channel Radio"" on another track for banning the Chicks from all their country stations across America.\n\nKEEP FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, NATALIE, MARTIE, AND EMILY!!! There are millions of us who are your side. Because of artists like you this world just become a better place. ""I HOPE""";The Dixie Chicks and Jabanoski Are The Most Corageous Acts Ever Recorded

253;719.0;5.0;12.0;"When we read a review of this CD, where the Chicks mentioned they were modelling their future career choices after Bruce Springsteen (our family favorite), we were intrigued enough to check into it for ourselves.  We bought the CD and WE LOVE IT!!!  All 4 members of our family love this and frankly, anyone who's ever had to take ""the long way 'round"" to achieve their goals will relate to the messaging.  This is a wonderful collection of well-thought lyrics and music.  We loved it enough to buy tickets to see the Dixie Chicks in concert in Washington DC last week and THAT WAS GREAT TOO!!!  They played to a nearly full house and brought together old and new fans.  The split of music played at the concert was a good way to introduce the old and new fans to the different types of music.  We have bought 5 more copies of this to give out as presents and our friends have loved this CD too.  There's not a bad track on this disc - the Dixie Chicks cover being Moms, loving their kids, feeling uneasy about being targeted for speaking their minds (and who hasn't had that happen at some point in their life?!), etc.  Great music and thought-provoking lyrics.  We look forward to more outstanding work from the Chicks on their next CD.  Bring it on!!! :)";Bruce Springsteen Fans Love the Chicks!
263;720.0;5.0;12.0;What a great project for Chicks fans!!

271;721.0;5.0;12.0;I will preface this by saying I am a hardcore Dixie Chicks fan.  My qualifications include running a website about them from 2000-2004, attending 6 concerts to date, and being an active member of their online communities for nearly 6 years.\n\nWith all of that said, I could hardly contain myself waiting for this new album.  I was one of the people in line when the doors opened at Target at 8:00 am.  There was a part of me that was nervous, I knew they were going a different way, and I was hoping that I would want to be on board with it.  Was I ever!\n\nThis is an amazing album.  Anyone who appreciates music should listen to and love this album.  It has depth, layers, light-hearted moments, soul-tugging moments.  There are songs that make you want to get up and dance and songs that you make you solemn.\n\nAnyone should be able to find a song to relate to.  My personal song on this album is The Long Way Around.  It is not as anthem-y as Wide Open Spaces (which I love as well), but just the same you feel like your life is at least comparative to other peoples' lives.\n\nThere are only a few songs I *sometimes* skip over...not because I don't like them, but just because there are others I am dying to hear.  I can skip Bitter End, Lullaby, and Lubbock or Leave It (5,6,7).  I think it also happens because that leads me to Silent House which I adore.  My other most favorite it Voice Inside My Head.\n\nAnyone who has ever listened to the Chicks or anyone who has never listened to the Chicks will benefit from hearing this album and having it in their personal collection.  You will be hard pressed to find a better collection of songs, or a more personal collection.  The Chicks have done it again, and I think they will be doing it for years to come.;You have to buy this album!

289;723.0;5.0;12.0;"I LOVE this album. The Lullaby is delicate and precious, like the child by whom it was inspired, I'm sure. I cry every time I hear it. Not Ready to Make Nice is awesome, very powerful. It really puts things into perspective. Death threats are a bit much for some people who simply shared an opinion; an opinion that is sadly becoming more and more relevant. The one about losing a parent to dementia is very poignant. Again, a wonderful treat of an album.";Beautiful lyrics and music
296;724.0;5.0;12.0;"The best of the Dixie Chicks music is their terrific harmonies supported by great instrumental work. There are several songs on this one where they just nail the harmonies spectacularly. I love the quiet intenisty and deep emotion of ""Empty House"", ""Hold On"" and ""I hope."" I also love the kick-butt energy of ""Not ready to make nice"" independent of the political message behind it. We've all felt that way at times- I'm angry and I want to be angry! The power in the song is intense. I find myself listening to this one over and over.";The best isn't the in your face
304;725.0;4.0;12.0;"This CD is a new brew, perhaps what comes with age and experience: angry, bittersweet, sad, regretful, but still with the gutsiness and sweetness of Natalie's unique voice.  The songs that stick with me are not the angry ones, the ones that give `em the finger.  Instead, I keep coming back to the regrets of the rock-style song ""Voice inside My Head,"" familiar to anyone looking back at the earthquake of teenage love from a later stage of life and choking in tears: ""...I've got a husband and a child/But I'll never forget/What I've given up in you...Am I better off this way...""  And what is most firmly stuck in my mind, coming back when I'm mowing the lawn and even after I played to Dylan's Blonde on Blonde several times over the other day, is the song Bitter End and its swaying rhythm: ""It's alright...it's not alright...You had a good time/Drinking all of our wine...As long as I'm the shiniest star/Oh there you are...""  There is something so perfectly suited to the song when Natalie's voice breaks imperfectly on the ""right"" part of ""alright.""\n\nThe only thing I miss is that special Dixie Chicks recipe of two scoops of crazy exuberance and one of pure sweetness that I enjoyed so much in past recordings.  But that's the thing--they can't just follow the recipe.\n\nI know a lot of the exuberance turned into anger after the well-publicized introduction that the Dixie Chicks got and are still getting to our native American strain of Taliban-style thinking, to the scolds and shrews and haters who just won't ever understand the inherent conflict between freedom and patriotism.  Perhaps some of the anger is the realization by maturing young women that ""entertainment"" works a certain way--you either do what you want and take what comes (as Bob Dylan did musically long ago--enduring people who actually bought tickets to his shows so they could boo him--or as Muhammad Ali did with his politics and religion, and many more--maybe less in recent times), or do what most entertainers do--settle into a comfortable sameness and mutual loyalness with an aging fan base.\n\nBack when they put out Home, I read that the Dixie Chicks were thinking of doing a rock album.  Perhaps this CD is a bit of what they had in mind.  I'm glad they're stubborn about making music with their voice, saying something from their own lives and selves, and standing a tall step above just churning out what fits the ruts of the music industry.\n\nI don't give this a 5 simply because I have to save that for the very few (music) world-changing albums.  I savor this album, but I bet once they're past the anger, the Dixie Chicks could set their minds on and pull off an album that completely changes American music.";Bitter End

Not many CD's can keep my attention for the length of the disc once, much less over and over again. This one has me completely hooked. I've always enjoyed the Dixie Chicks but this CD sends me over the edge to absolute DC admirer and fan. It's fun to feel so enriched by music and I really respect those who can envoke those feelings. The Dixie Chicks not only do that for me but they help me find pride in my southern roots. Thanks Ladies!";ADDICTIVE & INTOXICATING!
364;727.0;5.0;12.0;I commend the Chicks for their strength and patriotism!  Their willingness to stand up for what they believe in (country, right to free speech, and their music) is what makes them the artists they are.  This album is exceptional.  Their music rises like cream!  Natalie's voice melts like butter while Emily and Martie's instrumentations brings chills to my skin!;Superb
367;728.0;5.0;12.0;I want to just write this review about the CD but just feel the need to say that I can't believe what I've read in some of the statements below. Just listen to the music and enjoy. The Dixie Chicks are awesome, who cares about their views. Go to Fox News Page if you want to write your political views.;Reviews for a CD or Political Forum?
371;729.0;4.0;12.0;Contrary to some reviewers opinions, the Dixie Chicks (natalie Maines in particular) did NOT make anti-american statements. She made some anti-bush statements. There's a BIIIIG difference. That said, I have to say that I loved this album. It's obviously a series of personal statements by Maines and she is passionate about every single word. The music itself is quite beautiful, introspective, and sexy. Wonderful harmonies, like the Chicks always have. There are some quiet rock moments to make some points, but in general the album is a stand against the wind. The only negative thing I would say is that there are maybe a song or two too many concerning herself and not enough fun. But it's still great.;4 1/2 really. Great album
372;730.0;5.0;12.0;"Contrary to what many ""country fans"" say about keeping their mouth shut, Mr. Toby Keith openend his mouth and all the country fans listened. Why is he allowed to open his mouth and urge fans to support the war and not the Dixie Chicks?  Who does he think he is?  So it's ok to be pro war, but it's not ok to be anti war?  According to Toby Keith, Americans no longer have a say and freedom of speech is no longer valued. The Dixie Chicks should screw country music music and go adult alternative. I understand the fact that country fans are patriotic and the Dixie Chicks are just singers, but they had courage to say things that many of us have thought all along.  They just happened to have a platform to be heard.  The truth is that many country fans are ignorant about what is going on with the war.  If I had to choose, I'd rather listen to what these talented artists have to say as opposed to somebody who sings ""Honky Tonk U.""  Or, I could choose not to listen to either of them and base upon solely on talent, in which case I choose the Dixie Chicks.\n\nBy the way, I do like some of Toby Keith's stuff, I just don't know why he's become the spokesman for country music and it's stance on the war.";Great album
377;731.0;5.0;12.0;"SO glad the Chicks are back!  They are a must see in concert!  I never have been a real big fan of country music, per se, but to me, the Chicks have such a different attitude with their sound.  They aren't polished and ""blinged out""; they are as real as real gets, and I can truly appreciate some realism these days.  This album, as stated before, is more somber, ""grown-up"", if you will...and the only wish I would have for it is to have another spunky-crazy-country girl song on it akin to ""Earl"".  The Chicks are so fun, so lively, so DIFFERENT in a world that is full of cloned music and sampled soundtracks.  I still give it 5 stars, though, because their bravery and tenacity just goes to show that you can't keep a good musician (or 3) down.  I have every album, and will continue to buy them as long as they crank them out.";Love it, Love it, Love it
379;732.0;5.0;12.0;My daughters and I proudly listen to these ladies, even more so after they spoke their mind a couple of years ago.  Their music resonates with me and I am okay with my kids hearing it (not a very easy to find combination);better than ever
380;733.0;5.0;12.0;"The Dixie Chicks come back rockin'!  There's not one song on here I would be tempted to push ""skip"" on!  Lullaby is beautifully done and the electric violin on Not Ready To Make Nice is INCREDIBLE!! They are ticked off at the way they have been treated and they funneled it into a kick butt album!  You go, Ladies!";They are BACK!
391;734.0;5.0;12.0;This is the best CD that the Dixie Chicks have done. It may not be getting much playing time on country radio but it was once the top selling Billboard CD, with good reason. Satelite radio plays their songs frequently. Funny how the concerts sell out in the Blue states and they have to cancel them in the Red states. The Red states don't know what they are missing!;Great album!
398;735.0;3.0;12.0;To tell you the truth, I bought this just to give the Chicks a pat on the back for not backing down for voicing an opinion. Turns out, it's a pretty good album! Wishing them the best of luck as they find a new fan base.;Support the Chicks
411;736.0;5.0;12.0;Simply a fantastic compilation. Richly produced. Masterfully performed. Natalie has never been better. I've listened to it non-stop since I bought it and it IS the best music you'll find out there--bar none. The Chicks are back, baby!;Check your politics at the door and enjoy this materpiece
457;737.0;5.0;12.0;Wonderful work!  I haven't been a fan of the Dixie Chicks' music until now.  If you've dismissed them, try this album!!;Soulful & Expressive
460;738.0;5.0;12.0;They have always made beautiful music regardless of their position on the war and/or the Presdident.  I had to buy this CD.  WOW - beautiful music again.....I love it and have listened to it daily since I got it about 2 weeks ago.  They are powerful, talented musicians/singers.  No one can dispute that!;What a come back?!
473;739.0;5.0;12.0;"If this new album is any indicator, some of their best music is coming out of the controversy. The sound is different than their earlier work, but in a good way. They've grown up, and their music is growing up with them. ""I made my bed, and I sleep like a baby."" I consider their music to be true patriotism, not the sorry excuse for mindless rank and file that the religious right would have you believe is patriotic. Keep singing, and for gods sake keep talking too!!!";Controversy looks good on the Chicks!
479;740.0;5.0;12.0;"As i'm not an american, i don't know how american thinks. U don show your ""Patriotism"" by just banned dixie chicks. That's funny. Those who are anti- dixie chicks pls don come here. Personally i do not support war, do u wanna see your own country bomb or attack by some other country? Dixie chick just speak what in their mind, they are doing something right, we should just leave their politic view behind but focus on the music. Country radio that banned their song are stupid as without Dixie chicks it will nv be the same again.\n\nMusically this album are the best among  other chick's album. IT is very different style , more country rock. It shows that dixie chicks are the true mucisian. If u are want to listen to good music, this is the album for u. Probably the best album of the year. We'll see.\n\nFavourite Track: Taking the long way, So hard , Everybody Know/";Dixie chicks speak the truth
559;741.0;3.0;12.0;"I am a fan of the Dixie Chicks and thoroughly enjoyed their last album ""Home"".  Unfortunately, ""Taking the Long Way"" was too long.  I really enjoy the first song on the CD ""The Long Way Around"" and also ""Not Ready to Make Nice"".  Then dispite being bored to death I felt I owed it to the girls to listen to the rest of the CD.  Songs # 4-13 were BORING!  But song #14 ""I Hope"" is a real show stopper.  So the CD starts out great and ends great if you can stand to listen that long.";Three Out of Fourteen Isn't Great
572;742.0;5.0;12.0;I have to count myself among their fans who felt terribly let down by Natalie's unfortunate choice of words while on foreign soil.  I strongly disagree with her...However, this album is a classic and their talent is undeniable.;no denying their talent
605;743.0;5.0;12.0;"Although I originally purchased this CD to support the Chicks on their stand on the Iraq war and the freedom to be against it and still be considered a good American, I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  This is especially true because I do not like most country music.  The CD is categorized as ""country rock"", which I believe it is.  I like the whole selection, but several of the songs very, very much.  I also like that these three women compose and sing, in addition to taking care of a family and going on tour.\n\nFinally, the producer has done a great job.";surprised
607;744.0;5.0;12.0;"As the Dixie Chicks have said in a Terry Gross radio interview, many of these songs deal with the tumult that came from their 2003 political controversy and the songs' subject matter--being unfairly persecuted and threatened--deal with real pain and beauty that will pull your heart strings. They don't confine themselves into a rigid form so you'll hear eclectic influences, including soul. They explain that they felt liberated by not having to conform to any type of musical mold and the best songs on the album (my favorite is ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" which seems a commentary of their unfair political persecution) do indeed have a liberating, cathartic quality to them.\n\nThe songs exude the goodness and intelligence of this couragous group and I am glad that the succuss of this album bears witness to the fact that they were unfairly demonized and are now fairly vindicated.";Eclectic Personal Style Serves Them Well
615;745.0;5.0;12.0;"If you listen to this cd for the first time, you'll be like ""well it's ok"" but the more you listen to the words the more you love it. For people to be angry with the Dixie Chicks is beyond words and for them to ban them on the radio is THERE mistake.\n\nTHIS CD IS REALLY GOOD. Buy it..";This CD rocks
632;746.0;5.0;12.0;These women really are true Americans!  They have really come through some muddy water and held their ground on what they believe in!  For all you so-called fans (Americans)and radio stations that turned against these ladies you should really listen to track three because this song is for YOU!!  This album is a must have!!  It would be a sin not to love it,  and them!!;Astonishing Album!!
670;747.0;4.0;12.0;"all because these ladies downright REFUSE to compromise themselves as artists and more importantly, AS OPEN-MINDED and STRONG-WILLED INDIVIDUALS in light of all the unnecessary flack they've been getting up until now. To me, that's what it means to be a true American in this country and that's why I'm not surprised to see their new album doing as well as it has upon its release. Just goes to show you how blatantly ignorant and reactionary country radio (and several of these so-called ""fans"") have been towards the group and, in particular, member Natalie Maines' emotionally-charged comment towards Bush three years ago at a London concert. In retrospect, that may have wound up doing more good for themselves than they could have ever imagined, lol! All they did in response was come up with this creative gem, perhaps their most career-defining work in the long run. Just about all these songs were either written or co-written by the group and the production ends up playing to their strengths as a tightly-knit unit. Their harmonies, as always, are wonderful to say the very least.\n\nFunny, I never considered myself a fan of their music but I must say I've come away with a newfound respect for the Dixie Chicks after enduring the firestorm they got enveloped in on that fateful day back in '03. 'Taking The Long Way' pretty much serves as proof positive of their staunch courage and unwavering spirit, as reflected in each and every one of the album's 14 stellar tracks.\n\nRecommended for ALL who like their music ""live and untelevised""!";4.5 stars: This could remain on top of the charts for the next several MONTHS...
672;748.0;5.0;12.0;I have listened to this CD everyday since it came out.  I really think it is the best CD of the year.  I am so proud of these young women.  Their talent is amazing - it speaks to all of us regardless of age.  I am thrilled that it is the #1 seller.  Even though country radio won't play their music, it is apparent that we want to hear it.;Go Chicks!
704;749.0;5.0;12.0;I love this album and I absolutely believe the Chicks deserve three cheers not only for their music but for their ability to stand up to the nationalistic furvor that Bush and his administration relied on to justify an immoral war.  Immanuel Kant once said that the morality of any act can be determinined by it's true motivation. I believe their right and my right to free speech is a moral motive to let their voices and my voice be heard.  Those who have bashed them must not understand that the American people were never provided with a true motive for going into Iraq and that in and of itself is a good reason to question the authority and morality of the war.  Go Dixie Chicks ... I'm not ready to back down in my belief that nothing good ever comes from war.  This is great music from true American patriots.;The Long Road Home Rocks
706;750.0;5.0;12.0;This is a wonderful album and I am so glad that America is standing behind the Chicks.  It is amazing to me how quickly people forget that music is an expression of emotion and feeling.  Since time began it has been a form to express ideas.  Why some people can't recognize this I haven't a clue. Please buy this CD and show America and the people around the world that American's still believe in freedom of expression.;Wonderful Album
717;751.0;5.0;12.0;Truly amazing!  Love the Dan Wilson collaboration on the first tracks.  Could listen to Taking The Long Way all day.  I'm a fan who didn't start listening to the Dixie Chicks until after they took a political stand, and I'm really glad I did!;Kudos to the Chicks and Dan Wilson!
736;752.0;5.0;12.0;"Just think, if the country music establishment and their fans hadn't reacted in such an uproar in 2003 over Natalie's remarks, would such a great album as ""Taking The Long Way"", have ever been made?\n\nIt has that ""wow"" factor. You know how sometimes a song connects with you so well, you feel goosebumps? Well, that's how good this CD is.\n\nIt showcases terrific vocals, smooth harmonies, and musical arrangements and creativity that challenges the listener to sit up and take notice. It seems a bit edgier, and more mature, than their 3 previous CDs.\n\nRight away, it starts off with ""The Long Way Around"", a rousing, open-the-car-windows and sing along-as-loud-as-you can anthem. The Chicks cleverly add two previous song titles into the lyrics of this one.\n\nWhat is so enjoyable is how they take chances with harmonies, and arrangements. And Martie's fiddle solos are fantastic, especially on ""Silent House"", ""Lullaby"", and ""Easy Silence"".\n\nCall it a collection of country-rock-pop-blues-rock-a-billy...I call it fantastic. Treat yourself to this gem. To paraphrase one of their earlier (pre Natalie) CDs, ""thank heavens for the Dixie Chicks""!";The Chicks are back....wow!
773;753.0;5.0;12.0;This is my first Chicks album and I'm glad I purchased it, great music. Let them keep speaking their mind. By the way I'm a Combat Vet. Yep! One of those that put their blood on the line.;Great Songs
778;754.0;5.0;12.0;This is a wonderful CD! It is honest and vulnerable.  The writing is great as is the harmony and melody of many of the songs.  Another thing I enjoy about it, is that they sing about a variety of topics, from romantic love, to a love of a relative to the personal things they have been through.\n\nGive it a chance, I think many will enjoy it and very relatable to the things we all go through.;LOVE IT!!
783;755.0;4.0;12.0;Not as country as I remember country being, a tad overproduced (as every studio album has become), but very listenable. I found myself checking out the lyrics in the liner notes on more than one occasion. It's nice to see that people are still writing songs that actually mean something to both the artist and listner.;Pleasantly surprised
817;756.0;5.0;12.0;And apparently, like Alanis, do their best work when they're pissed.;The Chicks are a national treasure...
834;757.0;5.0;12.0;The Chicks have never sounded better or more honest.  This cd is a great direction for them to take.  Despite everything they have been through, they refuse to apologize or becoume what other people want them to be. The more trauma the chicks go through, the better the music they put out.;Never Better
845;758.0;4.0;12.0;"""The Incident"" aside - the Chicks are still fairly consistent in the product they put out. And for those who can separate a 13 word comment from talent should be able to realize that. Rick Rubin fleshes out some slightly different variations of their talent as songwriters, musicians and vocalists - but he is not radically altering who they are, what they do or how they do it.\n\nThough the group might have positioned themselves to eventually divest themselves from their country/bluegrass background this disk holds firm to those roots.  I don't find `Taking the Long Way' to be as big of a departure as has been portrayed.\n\nThat being said - the songs are solid.  ""The Long Way Around"" ranks as one of their best songs. Harmonies couldn't be tighter on this song - as they are so good at doing. They allude to the past w/two song titles from `Home' in the lyrics:  `top of the world' and `long time gone' - it's a little tongue in cheek, but it works nicely.  Other songs are strong - including ""I Like It"", ""Everybody Knows"" ""So Hard"" and yes, ""Not Ready to Make Nice"".\n\nFor all the hubbub on the latter track - if `the incident' were not widely reported, the song could as easily be about any relationship gone bad.  They say `write what you know' - and they've lived this.\n\nFor me it comes down to talent and has nothing to do with public comments. Music shouldn't be safe...or we'd have nothing but MOR all day/all night.  Really listen - and you'll find three talented musicians who deserve to be heard for that.";The Hard Way
959;759.0;4.0;12.0;"I heard ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" a few weeks ago and haven't stopped listening to it at least a few times a day. I love that they aren't willing to return to the music scene with their tails between their legs but are instead continuing to stand up for what they believe in.\n\nAfter hearing the entire album the night before the cd was released (a genius marketing tool!) I was blown away at how different this album sounds compared to their previous albums and love the fact that no matter how they experiment musically, they continue to put out great music that remains distinctly Dixie Chicks. The Dixie Chicks not only continue to make great music, but are true role models that remind me why I love this country.";Another great album showing their diversity
976;760.0;5.0;12.0;I love the Dixie Chicks.  Sometimes when a group decides to let their political views begin to inform their art, the art suffers.  It can become torpid, lyrically uninspired, and too preachy (U2 anyone?).  To my extreme delight, this was not the case for the Dixie Chicks.  By allowing their true feelings and voices to surface in their music, the Chicks have allowed their music to flourish and find depths that are lacking in most popular music.  When Natalie Maines exercised her freedom of speech to criticize the deplorable actions of George W. Bush, she was a true American.  That freedom has allowed to the Chicks to soar high above the narrow-minded morons who don't know what freedom means and create a person and profound masterpiece.;Amazing Group That Only Continues To Grow and Impress!!!
979;761.0;5.0;12.0;"Well, after all the hub bub over Natalie Maines exercising her First Amendment rights, I HAD to get this CD. I have all the other Dixie Chicks CDs, too, so I'm no newcomer. The ONLY reason I listen to country music is because enormously talented acts like the Dixie Chicks, Tim & Faith, and Alison Krauss could compete for my ears with the likes of Radiohead, Dead Can Dance, and REM, among others. I stopped listening to country radio when the Chicks were completely vilified for being American.\n\nAs for the quality of this disc, I'd have to say this is their most musically even CD to date. Each song flows naturally to the next. The melodies are stronger than ever. I agree with those who say this disc sounds more grown up. ""The Long Way Around"" is a perfect sequel song to ""Wide Open Spaces."" ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is an eloquent response to the BS the Chicks have had to endure. ""Lubbock or Leave It"" totally rocks. ""Lullaby"" is simply beautiful. ""I Hope"" gives me hope. Rick Rubin is a brilliant producer and he works his magic once again in assisting the Chicks in making completely memorable music.\n\nGuess what all you haters out there? The Chicks make damn good music. Get over yourselves. I still like Toby Keith's music even though I despise his support of know-nothing Bush. It IS possible to like someone's music and disagree with their politics. And all artists are entitled to express their political beliefs, just like you and me. It'd be un-American not to.";Still got their game
988;762.0;4.0;12.0;Regardless of their views or what people think of them, the bottomline is the Chicks are talented.  They've put fourth another solid album w/ lyrics to match.  It has a slightly more mature sound.  I had heard it was going to be rock or a crossover album, but it sounds like the Chicks to me.  They've come back fighting and good for them!  It's a cd that after a couple of spins you'll want to spin again and again.  If you're a chick fan this should be in your collection.  I'm very pleased with my purchase!  Thanks girls!!  (2008!);THEY'RE BACK!
45;763.0;5.0;11.0;I hope, The Long Way Around, Lullaby and Not Ready To Make Nice are all excellent songs, and yes, Natalie is one amazing vocalist. I bought this cd out of support for the Chicks and all the crap they've gone through. Since than I've really fallen in love with this cd, and I will look for more of their releases in the future. And though I agree with Natalie's stance on the president, I wish everyone would get past their politics and listen to the music. It really is outstanding on every level.;This is a great cd, and all three women deserve to be heard
65;764.0;5.0;11.0;One of the best CD's I've ever heard. Natalie Maines' vocals and lyrics are strong and the music beautifully enhances the deep emotion of those lyrics. I definitely recommend!;Every track is a favorite!
66;765.0;5.0;11.0;"Even though country music is usally not my thing, I fell in love with the Chicks the first time I heard ""Goodbye Earl"".  I stood by them through the whole ""controversy"" (and went out and bought extra copies of all of their albums in support).  I was one of the first to buy this album as soon as it came out and I still listen to at least one or two song from it almost every day.  Natalie has one of the most amazing voices of any genre of music.\n\nThe Long Way Around  is easily my favorite song, as it is something I can readily relate to!\n\nEasy Silence, Baby Hold On, Bitter End and Not Ready to Make Nice are other favorites of mine.\n\nWhether you agree with their views, or even if you think you hate country music (like I used to think I did) give this album a try.  Then go listen to Home, Fly and Wide Open Spaces.  I bet you'll get hooked, just like I did!!";The Chicks are better than ever!
95;766.0;1.0;11.0;Ok..not country..not rock, pick a genre please. They were better before all of the political mess. Now they are LA pop wannabes, the music is not growing but has fallen stagnate to just being a political retort soundtrack. *YAWN*;What  music!!!???
96;767.0;1.0;11.0;This is a bad album.  Someone answer me this simple question: I don't like Bush either and thought it was amusing when the Dixie whatevers put him down, but when a group calls their own fans stupid and they still buy the music?  I guess they proved their point with all the raving reviews here.;Absolute Drivel

167;770.0;5.0;11.0;"""It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself,\n\nguess I could've made it easier on myself.""\n\nThis blunt assessment of the years between ""Home"" and ""Taking The Long Way"" comes from the bridge to the opening song of their new CD, and the Dixie Chicks pull no punches. The title song, an assessment of the band's past and future, tells of families that never move away from their parent's ZIP code to the their decision to pursue a less-than-ordinary life. It's the best ""make-it-on-your-own-terms"" song this side of Springsteen. But they didn't just leave it at that. The entire band sits back and recalls the whole year and their treatment at the hands of the intolerant - then emerge unrepentant on ""Not Ready To make Nice."" Possessive of more real emotion than the last three Toby Keith CD's combined, ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the sound of the REAL angry Americans, and has Natalie's best vocal on the disk. To that end, this new CD is brilliant.\n\nBut there is more to ""Taking The Long Way"" then the blackballing the Chicks took from the redneck retards in country radio (the ones that even refused to accept advertising money from the Dixie Chicks for concert advertisements - and then crowed when the concert halls didn't sell out). Rick Rubin brings the same kind of empathic musical ear he brought to the likes of Johnny Cash, Tom Petty or even Neil Diamond. As that kind of ""Musician's Producer,"" Rubin invests the songs with the best arrangements possible, refusing to allow the Nashville hackwork that frequently sinks other talented performers under an anchor of mediocrity. ""Voice Inside My Head"" even includes a sitar! He knows where to put things, and when to hold back. It adds to the grace of ""Taking The Long Way.""\n\nOne of the best of 2006. And Rubin deserves a Grammy.";The Dixie Chicks and Rick
175;771.0;5.0;11.0;The Dixie Chicks' Fly was one of the reasons that I even started listening to country music again, after having been forced to listen to it during the 60's and hating every minute. This albums' themes are serious, with very little to lighten the mood, but considering what the Chicks have gone through in the last 3 years, the craftsmanship is outstanding. My musical tastes are hard rock and classic metal, but this always will be one of my favorite albums. Good music comes in all kinds and flavors!;something here for most everyone
189;772.0;5.0;11.0;As good as it gets, I agree with others who purchased this cd, fan of any music, you'll enjoy the artistry of the Dixie Chicks on this cd, more artists need to step out of the shadows...The Best to the Dixie Chicks..;Best CD Out this year
198;773.0;5.0;11.0;"I'll admit, when I first bought this album, it didn't grow on me as quickly as their albums have in the past.  But, the music on this album has a different feel and they perform it with a different attitude.  Some people call it spiteful or bitter.  I call it passionate.  I've never heard such passion in their music and I love it!  I also like that this album isn't so ""country"" and I think it's a really good sound for them (although, I do like their country and bluegrass music as well).  To me, this just proves that they don't have to be pegged as ""country artists""--they can cross over into other genres and their music still sounds brilliant.\n\nTo the folks who are giving honest opinions about the album and saying they don't like it, give it a little more time.  It's a different sound than you're used to... give it some time to grow on you and you'll love it like I do!  To all those who have come onto this site to bash the chicks based on their political views, not their music... go away.  You're not welcome here.";Love These Pro-Freedom Ladies... and Their MUSIC!!
249;774.0;5.0;11.0;I recommend this to everyone.  It's packed with really good songs and has been a long time coming.  If people can manage to appreciate the Dixie Chicks for their artistry and remember that this country is based on freedom of speech, then this album should do really well.;"Another winner from the ""Chicks"""
252;775.0;5.0;11.0;I bought this album based on the previous reviews...and I join those who loved it!! The CD stayed in my CD player for about 3 weeks without changing. It can be easy to listen to if you so choose, but if you really want to listen to the lyrics you can tell these girls have experienced a lot since 2003. In my opinion, whether Natalie's comments back them turned you off or got you more fired up for the Chicks, you should listen to this CD!;Still love them!!
261;776.0;5.0;11.0;"This is an amazing CD that was well worth the wait.  Anyone staying away because of politics is missing a great bunch of songs.  They are strong, and talented.  If anything they are better than ever musically and vocally.  But be warned, this is not an album about babies and flowers.  They hit the contoversy head on. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is easily one of the highlights.  Girl musicians rock.  MMG";Powerful Album
268;777.0;3.0;11.0;"First of all, I don't care what political affiliation the Chicks or any other entertainer is, which is why they should stick to the one and leave the other alone when on stage. Having said that, I bought this album because I listened to a sample of Not Ready to Make Nice and was so impressed with the message, the harmony, etc.  Great song!  But with the exception of Lullaby, the rest of the songs are more of the same type of in your face-I'll say what I want and if you don't like it, too bad.  The album just seems like one big ""you can all go to hell if you don't like what I'm saying"" deal.  As a long time DC fan, I hope they get back to what made them stars and make some fun loving, honky-tonk, cry in your beer or dance at your wedding music and leave the political preaching to the talking heads on Fox and CNN. If I want to know someone's political views, I don't expect to hear them at a music concert or on a music album. I hope this cd allowed them (Chicks) to get all the resentment/anger on this subject out of their system, because if any of it spills over into their next project, color me gone.";Not Ready To Make Nice sent a good message...the rest, well...
274;778.0;5.0;11.0;In a climate screaming for 'Freedom of Speech', the Dixie Chicks' new album hits home with beautiful, thought provoking, and wonderfully different songs that cross the borders of age and bias, as well as music genre. Meaningful and soul searching, this album was a hit with every person I introduce it to. From my 13 yr old son, to my 72 year old mother, including my 23 year old friend. Each one, including myself, found ourselves enthralled by the words, and the melodies. It is an homage to the women the 'Chicks' have become.;Taking the Long Way
286;779.0;5.0;11.0;"This is a great CD.  Music is fun, and lyrics are cool and in some cases, inspirational.  I admire the Chicks for standing up for their seemingly unpopular position.  I ordered the CD as soon as I heard some arrogant country music DJ's saying that the Chicks ""need to shut up, just shut up""  I can't stand anyone trying to squelch free speech!  But I also ended up with a great CD!";Great music!
294;780.0;5.0;11.0;I love this CD. I love the vocals, especially. It is a joy to listen to the girls singing in choir. Their voices blend so divinely. Even if they were singing jingles for commercials I'd still buy their CD. I enjoy listening to singers that can sing really well.;The Chicks rock!
337;781.0;3.0;11.0;"The Chicks are prety damn talented.  This seems to be a cd where they are trying to find their ""voice"".  That's fine except that the first part of the cd covers their issues with their fanbase... over and over and over.  It gets a feeling of beating a dead horse.\n\nFor the people who liked the Chicks before the controversy, there's plenty to like after the first 4 or 5 tracks.  They covered most everything they needed to say about the controversy in ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", a fantastic song in it's own right.  But to hit us with several more variations on the same theme just seems like a little girl stomping her foot and crying, ""I am happy, I am, I am, I am!""\n\nLullaby, Silent House, and Voice Inside My Head are great songs.  With Silent House and Voice touching on tough topics in caring and thoughtful ways.\n\nA worthy effort, the girls are showing growing pains.  They will only get better.";A bit overrated because of the past controversy...
348;782.0;5.0;11.0;What beauty! What style! This album is like a very fine bottle of champaign. Salute, Dixie Chicks!!;Wow!
356;783.0;5.0;11.0;"I had expected the songs to be a lot more defensive, because of all the hype surrounding the release. But they turned out to be very personal and well-crafted.\n\nReally liked the arrangement of the first 5 songs, and count them among my favorites! Especially love the second song ""Peaceful Silence.""";Loved it!
365;784.0;5.0;11.0;"I have all the Chicks CD's and this one is the best yet.  I listened to the whole CD before buying it and fell in love with it the first time I listened to it and bought it the next day! There are so many favorites on this CD but if I had to pick out the best they would be the tracks ""Easy Silence"", Lubbock or Leave It (which definetely ROCKS), ""Silent House"" and ""Voice Inside My Head"". This 49 yr. old LOVES this music.......GO CHICKS!";Chicks at their best
368;785.0;5.0;11.0;I am not a big fan of country But this is one great album.\n\nWe bought it to send a message after radio stations refused\n\nto play it. And we love it! You go girlfriends!!!;WOW!
370;786.0;5.0;11.0;"Like many others have said....Natalie did not make Anti-American remarks......she made Anti-Bush remarks.  And with the way the world is today, who can blame her?  In fact 71% of Americans would now probably agree with her.  (Based on Bush's last popularity being at 29% -- Nixon was this low too, I think).\n\nThat said, the songs on this album are great.  Plain and simple.  The lyrics on ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" make my eyes well up everytime I hear them....especially the part when Natalie throws in an extra kick of emotion regarding the threats the girls have had against them since ""the incident"".\n\nThe song that they did for Katrina Relief ""I Hope"" is also a wonderful song with poignant lyrics.  This song was written immediately after Katrina and sung during the telethons that followed.\n\nIt is definitely a shame that people still to this day believe that the girls are Anti-American.  Why don't we hear that Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, Neil Young (yeah he is from Canada but has made the USA his home), Black Eyed Peas, Willie Nelson are Anti-American?  They have made the same comments, but noone has taken them to heart the same way.\n\nI for one believe that America is about free speech and I will always support those artists who exercise their rights and not bow under pressure to suppress their rights.  If you truly believe that the Dixie Chicks are un-american for expressing themselves, then perhaps YOU are the one who is ANTI-AMERICAN.";A Great Album From A Great American Band
386;787.0;5.0;11.0;"I absolutely love this CD, from start to finish.  So many times when I purchase a CD, I end up only liking one song and feel like I wasted my money.  Not so with this CD!  Every song is great and ""Taking the Long Way"" will be added to my list of all time favorite CDs!";Worth every penny!
396;788.0;4.0;11.0;"i will always love the dixie chicks. we own 3 previous cds. i have yet to purchase this one, but they sound fantastic as always. the stupid politicizing by the idiot below totally turns me off. my brother died on 9-11 and to say that ""the US deserved it"" is the most rediculous, painful and shameless thing i have ever heard. grow up and just enjoy the music.";very offended...but entertained
417;789.0;5.0;11.0;"If you're like me and don't actually buy an entire CD anymore unless you think it's going to be awesome (thank you Steve Jobs)...this is a ""buyer"". I really liked their last CD (also a ""buyer"") but this is a whole new level of good. Definitely a great CD.";Wow!
419;790.0;5.0;11.0;"I confess to having always liked the Dixie Chicks.  That said, this latest offering delights and seduces the ear because of their fresh sounds -- altogether new for them, clever harmonics, and captivating lyrics.  The more I listen to ""Taking The Long Way"" the more I hear, and the more I like what I hear, and the DXC.";Fresh Sounds
432;791.0;4.0;11.0;"I love the chicks and was glad to see new music from them. I was not disappointed in this album. I think this is the first album where they write all the music and they deserve kudos for the content. The world famous melodic harmonies are still there, the country banjo and violin, but I think their music has matured and their emotions deepened. You won't find ""Goodbye Earl"" on here, but what you will find is heartfelt and strong. The first time I heard ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", I was actually screaming out loud, ""Yes! Yes ! Yes! You go girls!"" Great answer to the ""incident"" and shows that not only are these ladies super talented, but they are also fiercely bonded to each other and their convictions. I also love Lullaby and It's So Hard. Great songs. Not a lemon on the record. What a great ""comeback"" album!!";Good comeback
454;792.0;5.0;11.0;This is a GREAT CD. I think it is their best ever. I especially like the direction their music going. Excellent, excellent CD!!!!;Taking the Long Way Home CD
472;793.0;5.0;11.0;A very nice album. Three cheers for the Dixie Chicks for not caving in to political pressure.  Keep the music coming.;WAY TO GO DIXIE CHICKS
538;794.0;5.0;11.0;This is the best Dixie Chicks CD to date. I admire them for having the guts to say what they beleive and not giving into the Country Freaks and Nashville bullies. Keep up the good work girls.  Roy Haynes;You Go Girls!!!!!
554;795.0;5.0;11.0;"I'm a good ol' boy from Boston MA, went to a fancy NE college (25 years ago).  I always liked rock and found most jazz to be listenable.  I never was exposed to country music until a few years ago when my then new iPod demanded to be filled.  After filling it with the several hundred CDs in my collection, I decided to try something new, and the Dixie Chicks were then one of the major acts in country music.  I bought ""Home.""\n\nSo I listened and, surprising myself and my snobby northeastern friends, I liked them alot.  The great vocals coupled with the incredibly tight acoustic music made me a great fan.  All of the DC's prior CDs are also among my favorites.\n\nI'm not sure this one will be.  Still, I recognize it as a very thoughtful, highly spirited, musical and necessary response to the ""buttheads"" of the world who quite wrongly mistook the comments of one of the DCs critical of our invasion and occupation of Iraq as being unpatriotic and unjustified (and the bad mistake it turned out to be) and therefore thought right for the DCs to suffer their virtual banishment from ""conventional"" country music.\n\nSince it it responsive to their highly personal concerns, the DCs wrote or co-wrote most or all of the songs on the album (most of their earlier work was ""covers"" of materials written by others).  Their writing and the songs reflect their justifiable anger at those who have rejected their completely a-political (until now) music due to that single comment. They also reflect a substantial songwriting talent I never knew the DCs had. In the change in their style, these songs also reflect a very intelligent move by them (in the sense that we all need to keep our jobs)to appeal to an audience with broader political views than their prior core audience.\n\nThe album as a whole sounds more like countrified mainstream music (I just can't bring myself to call it pop, and hip-hop it ain't) than their prior albums and that is the source of the title ""Disappointed"" for this review.  I miss the old sound and hope that, someday, the CMA establishment will permit them to return to it. I don't dislike these songs (see below;  they just aren't quite the same as ""Top of the World"").\n\nBut the songs themselves, especially those dealing directly with both their political views and their reaction to the political intolerance of their old audience, are masterful.  They are emotionally honest and compelling, even though they have more of the ""hooks"" pop music is noted for. For anyone, like me, who loved their old style, these songs will be a bit of a disappointment only in the sense that they aren't more of the same.  But if the same people like good music, its an album worth ten times the price.\n\nIf I could convince them to, I'd love for the DCs to get rid of most or all of the electric powered insruments forming so much of the music on this album, but still apply the emotional power and honesty found in most of these songs.\n\nA Big Fan, I still am.\n\nTFHurley";Disappointed, but still 5 stars plus
616;796.0;5.0;11.0;I'm not a big country fan.... but listening to this album... I am now sold on the Dixie Chicks.... not only do the Chicks have my respect for their stating their mind and sticking by it! They have my respect for their muscial and lyrical talent.... 'Not Ready to Make Nice' is obviously the flagship of the album ... and it should be as it has a great hook and is just so catchy....\n\n'Easy Silence' is very nice as well... 'Everybody Knows' is a a cool melody... 'Bitter End' has a nice meloncholic value to it... 'Favourite Year' and 'Voice inside my Head' round out the album.... overall it's a 4 star album... but given the backlash that the chicks stood up to they deserve the 5 star rating!;Great Album By Three Great Ladies
621;797.0;5.0;11.0;I was introduced to this CD from a friend. Man! There are NO BAD SONGS on this. My husband and I danced in the kitchen to this. It is totally delicious. Don't get all caught up in the political crap. These are great, heartfelt songs. They are SONGS that you can enjoy and identify with if you are a woman, a mother or a PERSON! Love it. I did and ARE!;there are no bad songs on this CD
631;798.0;5.0;11.0;This is one awesome CD. Even though I feel everyone in the spot light should keep their views of politics or religion to themselves...this is one great CD. I don't want to know how anyone  feels about our current president ( or elected officals ) or tell me what religion is best for me. But hats off to the Dixie Chicks for another great CD.;Love em' or hate em'..........
635;799.0;5.0;11.0;"With the appalling tripe being sent out of Nashville recently,the rednecks hiphop and boozed out ""outlaws"" if they only had a clue who the Real outlaws were, I've been waiting for some real kick-butt country rock & heartache stuff,and with the chicks new album its here !!In your face and as real as it gets.

739;802.0;5.0;11.0;I'm not a country music fan and to my delight I found that this isn't a country music album. These women have created 14 of the most beautiful songs I've hear in a long time. The cowards who tried to blacklist the Dixie Chicks should be ashamed of themselves. This music will stand the test of time. Buy a copy for yourself and another for someone you love.;Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!

But forget all that and focus on the music cause theirs is the best.....I won't call it ""Country"" because this ain't country packaged by Nashville. This is your soul singing to you, a great big melting pot of music that's as big as the origins of our great country. God Bless the Dixie Chicks.";This ain't your father's COUNTRY music!
746;804.0;5.0;11.0;"Great album!! As for the criticisms that it isn't ""country"" since when did Nashville determine what was good country music? The ran Willie, Waylon and Jerry Jeff out in the 1970s and they came back to Texas so they could make the kind of music they wanted to. Heck, country radio wouldn't play the music Johnny Cash made in his final years, some of his best music ever. The Chicks are back, and this 6th generation native Texan ( unlike Bush, an import born elsewhere and sent to East Coast prep schools) is delighted.";Dixie chicks new album worth the wait
750;805.0;5.0;11.0;Just listened to the album this weekend.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Run out and buy this first chance you get!;Heartfelt Words and Beautiful Music
772;806.0;5.0;11.0;The complexity of the lyrics and music on this album take my breath away.  This is the Chick's version of the Beatles Sgt Pepper.  It provides the suggestion that their music is becoming more complex while giving a hint of things that are yet to come.\n\nGreat work Chicks;A new level of excellence
792;807.0;5.0;11.0;"There will always be Dixie Chicks lovers and Dixie Chicks haters.  This was the case even before the anti-Bush remarks and all the backlash.  I personally disagree with The Dixie Chicks' political remarks but am also proud to live in these great United States where ""Freedom of Speech"" should be respected and relished.\n\nI think this is by far the ""Chicks"" best albumn.  My hats off to their dedication to stick with their gut and make an albumn that doesn't apologize for anything they have done or said and is so deeply honest and reflective.  They have grown up quite a bit in their experiences and music and it shows.  This will be playing in my CD player for a LONG time.";Deeply honest and reflective
793;808.0;4.0;11.0;Can't say I have been a Chicks fan . . . I'm a blue-stater and bought the disc as a sign of support.  There has only been one album that I ever loved right off the bat - U2's Joshua Tree - - maybe also 10,000 Maniacs' In my Tribe.  Can't say I was blown away with this after the first listen, in fact, on some songs Natalie's voice gets a little grating.  But there were several songs that have stuck in my head and on repeated listens, I have really grown to love.\n\nNot much of a country fan here, but I do like bluegrass tinged music (like The Dead) and contemporary blues like Robert Cray, Paul Thorne, and even some old school blues like BB King and Albert King.  So the Chicks' move in the pop and blues direction is quite welcome.  I liked Not Ready to Make Nice right off the bat, but on second listen, it was Everybody Knows, I Hope, The Long Way Around, and Voice Inside My Head that really stuck with me.  There are a number of songs on here I really like - and only a couple I dislike.  So after having bought it for political reasons, I now have a disc I really like . . . two for the price of one.  And after listening to it and analyzing the lyrics . . . I'm now content to let it flow over me and enjoy it.;New fan
807;809.0;5.0;11.0;"The short and sweet of it: the Dixie Chicks' new CD is music not to be missed.  It catches you right from the first line and holds you until the very end of the CD.  The content is heavier than on past albums, but in a good way.  There's more of a rock flavor, and it is powerful.  Certainly, the Chicks do not shy away from the controversies that surrounded them for the past several years.  Instead the group meets them head on, offering a ""country"" rock album that actually says something, even if everyone won't agree with it.";best album yet
920;810.0;3.0;11.0;I have been a die hard fan of the Chicks since the beginning.  Never has a band moved me the way they do, constantly evolving and pushing themselves.  I ran out to buy their new album the day of its release and aside from what I've noticed in their lyrics, I am really disappointed.  Every song seems to have the same dull, whining, sound and not one (except for maybe Not Ready to Make Nice) is distinguishable from the next.  I don't regret my purchase because I will continue to love everything about the Chicks, but I do feel that this album gives off a lazy, uninterested tone on their part.;What happened to the Chicks I know and love??
23;811.0;5.0;10.0;"When I first heard that The Dixie Chicks' latest album, Taking the Long Way, had one the Grammy for Best Album of the Year, I just assumed that ""the powers that be' were helping the Chicks lick the wounds inflicted by the rednecks at ClearChannel in reprisal for the Chicks' saying that Bush made them embarassed to be from Texas.  I was wrong.  This is clearly the best album of 2006 and perhaps the best album in years!";They DESERVED the Grammy!
5;812.0;5.0;8.0;"Let's focus on the topic at hand: The music. This CD is good. There's no way of looking around it. If you don't like the sound of Natalie Maines voice, you've heard it by now. She has such a strong voice; it's incredible. These songs, while of a different tone, do not involve a new singer. They're good solid songs. One review I read called them ""whiney,"" but I'm not getting that vibe from them. Their songs are more empowering than they are whining. They don't have the pep and excitement or ""catchy-ness"" of the ""pre-incident"" days, but like everybody, their lives were in a different place when they came out with this album. Whether or not people agree with their political agendas, it's difficult to argue that these women don't make decent music. The vocals, the instruments, the lyrics- they're all legitimate and worth listening to. Some days you're in a ""Wide Open Spaces"" mood and some days you're in a different place. This CD is for the latter.";Good music
27;813.0;5.0;10.0;"WOW! First of all I have been thinking a lot about the reactionary attacks on the DC's since their minor 'so called' outspoken blunder in London that has decreased their record sales and brought out the DOGS in the US who call themselves Country Music Fans!\n\nFirst of all these damn hicks wouldn't know what Country Music really is if it hit upside the head!  This is the double-standard.  I am in my late 30's and over the last 5 years have gone through a process of not liking most country music to being a lover of the genre as I have learned what Country music is.\n\nCountry music is CASH, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Hank Williiams...the point is that if any of these MEN had said what the Chicks said publicly the reaction would have been non-existent, oh wait these men have said similiar things; some even more critical and damning and it never hurt their careers so why did the DC come under so muich fire?  The most simple answer is they are WOMEN!  Unfortunately if goes a lot deeper than that or what follows.\n\nCountry music is not about war, racism or hatred and has NO ROOTS in music that does either.  Some artists  and idiot fan followers have allowed the record companies to taint a pure music form since the eighties into something that is often confusing and makes no sense to many people like myself and REAL MUSIC LOVERS. Kind of reminds me of what has (and is happening) to HIP-HOP but for different reasons.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you look through the catalogs of the REAL COUNTRY MUSIC GREATS you will find a lot of albums and songs that 'tell the truth' about the real, ugly america.  For a real lesson in Country music check out 'Bitter Tears (Ballads of the American Indian)' by Johnny Cash and keep listening to JC and hating the DC's as so many ignorant idiots do.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks spoke the truth (excpet that W is from Maine, not Texas but he sure did a lot of damage there as he has to the US) and while ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is a great song it is no more ciritical than many other ones that have been written by men in the genre.\n\nNot a great record review (although I recommend it to any REAL COUNTRY FAN, or music fan for that matter) but it brings to mind many questions.\n\nWHO ARE THESE  mostly Southern American hicks, Record Companies and other reactionary artists who have attacked them and why did such a mild statement, YES MILD, create such a stir?\n\nThere are many reasons but as time has gone on most people who hated on the Chicks realized they were right to call out the President for the fraud he is but as Natalie wrote ""time heals all wounds, but I'm still waiting"".\n\nAmerica is a racist, sexist, brutal country founded on these foundations and it is also a rich beautiful country full of a great history of struggle in attempts to change this.  So why is it that the DC's were nearly ruined?  IGNORANCE!\n\nFor that matter let's consider why k.d lang was forced of the genre for being a lesbian...\n\nHATE and IGNORANCE solves nothing and even with all the problems in our country we still have the right to speak our mind (most of the time although this is going away and will continue to if we do not resist ignorance, apathy, hate and facism).\n\nKUDOS to the Dixie Chicks for keeping in LINE with the TRUE TRADITIONS of Country Music!\n\nIf you like good music buy (or download) all there music as I have, they are great.\n\nIf you hate the DC's for their stand get a life and an education; or jump off a cliff (especially those who wrote HATE MAIL)!\n\nKEEP IT UP GIRLS, YOU'RE AWESOME!\n\n(written by a white male)";Preaching to the chior about double standards?
38;814.0;5.0;10.0;"That's how much I LOVE this record!  Myself like others I've read, have never purchased a Dixie Chicks record before.  I have to admit I only bought it because I'm a huge Jayhawks (Gary Louris) fan, and wanted to hear his contributions.  Well, even if Gary had never ever written with these women, I would give this CD my highest rating.\n\nBest tracks are ""I'm Not Ready to Make Nice"".  This song give me chills every time I hear it, never fails to produce that effect.  ""Everybody Knows"" is my next favorite.  I'm not going into detail on each and every one, but if you've not heard the DC before or are a long-time fan, this record is for you, trust me.\n\nIt's a record that I find fresh and exciting every time I play it, still.  The Chicks are wonderful musicians, and Natalie has one of the best voices around!  This was my favorite record from last year and truly deserved it's title of Best Record from the grammys.";I'd Give it 6 Stars if I could
41;815.0;5.0;10.0;I loved the Chicks' first 3 albums, and though this one is very different from those, I love this one too.  It has such a different context, and is not all carefree and fun like some of their other stuff, but for obvious reasons with everthing they've gone through.  They really are very respectable artists and people.;Love it
42;816.0;5.0;10.0;Bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  I support the Chicks in all they do.  We loved their documentary.  Great, catchy music.  I like how their style evolves.;Another winner
46;817.0;5.0;10.0;This is the only Dixie Chicks album I've ever bought and it is absolutely THE BEST.  The music is beautiful, lively, edgy at times, and the lyrics are right on and from the heart.

47;818.0;5.0;10.0;Loved every song on this disc...the Chicks make good music, end of story. I can't recommend this enough...it's that good. They've been through so much...and it pours forth in each verse and lyric. Self-reflective, insightful, sometimes funny, sometimes angry and often poignant honest wondering and hopeful. They bare their souls in a stirring mix of almost acoustic simplicity. American underdogs sing courageous in your face.\n\nDrop your politics and give your soul something tasty!;Truly one of the best CDs in a long time...
48;819.0;5.0;10.0;"This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I love it even more after watching the Chicks' new DVD ""Shut Up and Sing.""  I think Taking the Long Way has finally landed the Chicks in the music category where they belong - with Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, Patty Griffin, the Indigo Girls - the whole Lilith Fair crew.  I'm not sure that there's a good name for that genre yet (folk just doesn't seem to cover it) but it's surely not country.  They never seemed like country artists to me (too smart  for one thing) and this album feels as though they've quit trying to wear that too-tight shoe and decided to go barefoot.  Rock on, Dixie Chicks! (Lilith on?)";The Dixie Chicks Finally Find a Musical Home
51;820.0;5.0;10.0;"I was absolutely not a Dixie Chicks fan prior to this CD. Now I am glad I opened myself up to something different, otherwise I would have missed out on this gem. Honestly, I am living proof that the Chicks' experience, with being banned from country radio and shunned by their regular brand of fans, brought them to the attention of a whole new type of people, myself included. They have truly grown and turned something potentially devastating into the ultimate positive. This is evidence of being empowered by opposition. Their ""Shut Up and Sing"" documentary film is a wonderful supplement to this disc. Kudos, ladies.";Fantastic listen
56;821.0;5.0;10.0;I love the Chicks!  Their music is always alive and believeable.  They have had a hard journey, exercising the rights they have in living in the US of A.  I am sorry country turned their back on them.  I like country too, although I don't listen as much since it seems like the genre is a bit closed minded.  I just like music and these ladies know how to put it out.  Go chicks!;Awesome as usual
59;822.0;5.0;10.0;Whether you agree with the Chicks on politics or not, you have to agree that they are one of the best acts in the music business.  This includes country, pop, rock, whatever.

Loved these gals who are great musicians, just so tired of the rambling blather about subjects they really do not know anything about.  Just stick with the music and let the lobbyists handle the bungling of the times.  Oh sure, the voices are heard but I want the music to be music not some politically motivated rant and wail.  Whining is at an all time high here and can we even wonder what they will have to talk about in 2009?  I was so disappointed I threw this out the car window and watched with glee as a Kenworth drove over it and smashed it into little bits.  Nat, well her voice is annoying in the first place so I would rather hear a fire alarm at close range.  The songs are about as intelligent as a Ted Kennedy driving school manual.  I hope the next album gets back to basics and they let Bon Jovi deal with being a poser.;Terrible and politically motivated

I've always spoken out against the politics of this administration and others like it...but NO one has ever stopped playing and buying my music.""\n\nNow that they have won Best Country Album of the year as well as Best Country Artists, I hope more of you will give them the chance to prove what terrific human beings they are...in addition to making dynamite music!";Well-Behaved Women Rarely Make History!
81;827.0;5.0;10.0;"I've never been a big fan of the Dixie Chix, but i thought their remake of ""Landslide"" was great. After watching them perform at the Grammys ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" i knew i had to get this album. Needless to say my wife and i love the album. Their sound and lyrics sound more mature, personal and uplifting. Great music comes in different sounds and genres; great musicians are able to embrace this concept and make true classic alubms- the chix did just that! After the backlash they suffered for exercising their right to freedom of speech and basically saying what most of us feel about our ""excuse of a president"", some thought they'd go away and ""shut up."" Luckily for us, they did not. Instead, they came back stronger and better- still defiant, still critical of injustice  and still willing to speak out..that's what being American is all about!!";Great album! As good as Mayer's Continuum!
100;828.0;1.0;10.0;can't bring myself to listen to more than 20 seconds.  truly sad they are so popular.  I guess they owe a debt to Bush, since he is responsible for their recent success at the Grammy's-  an even more sad affair considering who they won over - Chili Peppers, Raconteurs, etc etc etc  very sad day for music;poor excuse for music
130;829.0;5.0;10.0;I'm not a fan of the country genre or even the Dixie Chicks.  However, thanks to ALL the hateful posts against a group of brave and free-thinking artists, I decided that I have 10 liberal bucks to spare.  I ordered the CD just to say, Bravo, Ladies!  BTW, the song, Not Ready to Make Nice, is a great song.  So the Grammys are NOT just politics - the Dixie Chicks should be proud of their work.;Bravo, Ladies!
136;830.0;4.0;10.0;"This is a very good album full of emotions. There's the anger in ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", of course, but love and hope shine through in the rest of the album. Women with spines who sing and say what they feel! What a concept. And the fight against a bullying backward establishment only made them appeal to the wider audience around the nation. It's a solid record, and it's a courageous story. No wonder it won 5 Grammys as the worthy sentimental favorite.";I Like It!
150;831.0;5.0;10.0;"Saw ""Shut UP and Sing.""  Had to have the sound track and this was the next best thing.  All the songs are great.  They are a truly talented group.";Taking the Long Way
152;832.0;5.0;10.0;Wonderful set of songs. Go see their movie, too. After the movie you will love this group for both their courage and their music. I am now a life long fan.;Brave, Spirited, Outstanding

162;834.0;5.0;10.0;I like the Dixie Chicks because they don't pull their punches and stand up for what they believe in. This is evident in their music, which seems to get better with each album. Look no further than their first single, which is a testament to not only strong feminist ideals but also life in general. Their talent, grace and utter immeasurable passion is ingraved in every song throughout this CD. Please support good music and purchase this album, you won't be disappointed.;Dixie Chicks are here to stay!
163;835.0;4.0;10.0;"I've never been a fan of country music, but I've always had a soft spot for the Dixie Chicks, especially after their last album (""Home"").  Now some might argue that with this album, the Chicks are pulling away from the sound that made them popular in the first place.  I'll agree that this one is darker and less upbeat, but that doesn't make it any less great.  Sure, it's a somewhat different sound, a little bit edgier, but the heart and soul of the Dixie Chicks are still there.\n\nOthers might say that this isn't really country music, or bad one at that.  Again, I'd agree and say that it's not pure country music, and that it does have certain pop beats, which I think makes them more reachable and which is probably why I like them.  I'll just add this: what country artist today hasn't bordered with pop?\n\nI really liked this album, most of the songs are great (""The Long Way Around"", ""Everybody Knows"",""Baby Hold On"" and ""Not Ready To Make Nice"") although I have gotten used to skipping one or two tracks that I think tend to drag on a little bit.  As for the political side to the album, except for ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", it's easily forgotten, because there really is none and anyway it's not like they're the first singers to express their political opinions openly to their public (John Lennon for example, and even Barbara Streisand).";Thoroughly enjoyable
179;836.0;4.0;10.0;"The Dixie Chicks are back and ready to attack with their newest album, Taking The Long Way.  After their highly publisized arguementative statement about the President, the Chicks are ready to come back and once again take over our airwave, with what appears to be their best and  most personaly album.  It's also good to see that dispite many people publicly banning  the Dixie Chicks from radio air, their album and songs have still managed to sell and get out to everyone who want to listen.\n\nEven though things have seemed to cool down slightly, you can see even through some of the song titles that the tension is still there.  Titles like ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""Bitter End"" can only be taken as a slight jab at the public expressing their true feelings.\n\nI would have  to say that the best song on the album is the already publisized Not Ready to Make Nice.  The song has amazing lyrics backed up by powerful vocals, and lovely harmony.  You really get a feel that they are sorry for what they've said, but that they're not going to back down and say that they were wrong.  They are taking a stand through their song and saying that they cannot be brought down by the bad publicity.\n\nMy favorite line from the album is; "" Forgive sounds good, forget i'm not sure i could, they say time heals everything but i'm still waiting.""  The line speaks of the pain that will still linger and carry with them through the rest of their carrers, but that they are willing to let it all go and forgive.\n\nOverall, the album if full of little jabs at the public, but that's what drew me to the album.  I'm not the most mainstream type of person, and i like to find music that kind of strays away from that same old expected routine.  If you have a preset notion of what the Dixie Chicks are all about, then you might as well forget about it all, and buy this album.  Because after you do, you'll never want to go back to the old stuff again.";Three Years and A Few Songs Later
7;837.0;5.0;8.0;"A lot of political music doesn't hold up. Bob Dylan famously said of fellow folk musician Phil Ochs, ""Phil is reporting, not song-writing."" Today Dylan is a legend, and Ochs is remembered only by historians of 60's folks music.\n\nIn the end, music has to have passion, or it's just going through the motions. And passion is one thing this album has in spades. This is a personal album, a passionate album, not a political one, even though the personal events mentioned in many of the songs happened because of politics. Because it is a personal album it still holds up quite well now that ""That One"" is in office rather than GWB. Songs from the album are still on rotation in my iPod, such as ""So Hard"", ""Voice Inside My Head"", and ""Silent House"", that are just as good today as they were three years ago. People who claim it's a ""political album"" are reading something into the album that's not there. In the end this is a brilliant album about choices and the repercussions of choices  and facing up to those consequences with courage and passion, and the question of who is POTUS is irrelevant to that theme.";Country-rock with passion
218;838.0;5.0;10.0;"I love this CD, listen to it all the time. ""How Long Do You Want To Be Loved"" is great, i put it on replay while i drive.  The Fighting song is perfect.  Everytime i listen to it i say""you go Girls! you nailed it"".\n\nThe video is perfect too!";LOVE IT!
233;839.0;4.0;10.0;"The Dixie Chicks never dissappoint.  This album took a few listens before I began to really enjoy it, but now I love it.  There's no other band with the same kind of sound as the chicks, which is refreshing I think.  My favorite is probably ""favorite year.""  To those who think that this music isn't country: listen again!";refreshing
248;840.0;5.0;10.0;This cd is the best I have purchased in a long time!  What a comeback.  I can hear older Chicks songs in these new ones.  The title track is by far my favorite, but there isn't one song that I don't like.  If you like or have ever like the Chicks this is a must have!;I have been waiting for this
250;841.0;5.0;10.0;I loved this album.  It's unusual to have an album that one likes all the songs.  The Dixie Chicks make one think they are there with you, their songs mirror the paths of our lives.;Alive & Singing
264;842.0;5.0;10.0;Yeah, I know that buying the CD off of Amazon puts less money into the pockets of the artists. But I wanted to show support for the chicks, and didn't want to leave the house. You can see my conundrum. Thing is, I love their music, and I liked this CD. And, in a way I cannot fully articulate, I found it necessary to purchase this CD in physical form instead of buying it off of iTUNES. I felt that I was more fully supporting this brave group by getting a physical CD in the mail.;Taking the shorter way
273;843.0;5.0;10.0;This is my first Dixie Chicks CD and it is awexome. Every song strikes a cord. Great lyrics, and great music!;Dixie Chicks Rock
285;844.0;5.0;10.0;The best Dixie Chicks CD yet, imo.  The music is passionate and alive and the whole controversy from 2004 seems to have done nothing but strengthen their resolve.  This is a CD with real courage.  I highly recommend this CD!;Wonderful
300;845.0;5.0;10.0;Natalie Maines is gorgeous. Big plus.\n\nGreat harmonies. Great politics. Solid songwriting, top-notch production. One of the best albums to come out this year - and this from someone who's anything but a country music fan.;Charisma, heart, soul and guts.....

349;847.0;5.0;10.0;"It's said lately that if you're not ticked off, you're not paying attention. With the current state of affairs of American politics being what they are, it's nice to see public figures that will stand up and make a statement even if it means the type of redneck feeding frenzy that took place over Natalie Maines's comments about the president. Their concerts are being cancelled and they've received death threats for their positions. Regardless of your political stance, is this the America you want to live in?\n\nJoe McCarthy rose to fame because no one posed a serious challenge to his ego driven madness until Edward R. Murrow said ""enough"".

357;848.0;5.0;10.0;I bought this album only because I support the Dixie Chicks in thier battle with the Bush administration, but once I heard the album it is the greatest album I have bought in years. I love the style and the music, great sounds.;Real Stars
366;849.0;5.0;10.0;"This is their best album yet.  ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is superb (the music video is awesome too!).  Bought the album because of this song but was pleasantly surprised that I ended up enjoying the rest of the songs in the CD.";The best album yet!
373;850.0;5.0;10.0;I love this CD!  The Dixie Chicks have a wonderful fresh new sound, and I listen to my new CD constantly.  Keep the great music coming girls!!!;Happy Customer
387;851.0;5.0;10.0;Although I like all of the Dixie Chicks previous cd's, this is by far my favorite!  Great lyrics!!!!!!  Highly recommend it!;TAKING THE LONG ROAD
403;852.0;5.0;10.0;"Very happy with this CD .. great songs presented by a great group.  Everyone is entitled to their political opinion.. talent is talent.\n\n""To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are to stand by the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.""\n\n  --Theodore Roosevelt, 1918";Great CD - Great Chicks
404;853.0;5.0;10.0;"OK, yes, I agree with their views. But, reviews aren't about the politics (or they shouldn't be), they're about the music. And, this music is awesome.\n\nThe songs were all cowritten by the Chicks this time, and the lyrics are so poignant and mature on so many of the songs. When Wide Open Spaces came out, I was single. Now, like the Chicks, I'm married (and have twins, and live far away from my small town home) and so many of the songs just resonate with me. I don't think you have to be a 30-something mom away from home to enjoy them, though.\n\nThe feisty songs make me smile, the lullabye makes me teary. The collaborations are terrific. My husband and I were especially pleased to see Keb Mo on the Katrina relief track. ""My Favorite Year"" definitely has a Sheryl Crow vibe, which is a good thing, too.\n\nOverall, I just really enjoy all of the songs. Some are reflective, some are ""fighting songs"", some are just fun. Maybe it's not all pure country anymore (but trust me, there are definite country songs on this disc.) What I don't understand is someone saying ""I only like country music"" or ""I only like pop."" People who bought the album solely to support the Chicks, but didn't like country may find themselves changing their mind about country music. People who say they like country, but, like me, either agree with the politics or just love music will certainly love it. Judge each artist, even each song, by its own merits, and I think you'll be pleased with all of them on this CD.";It's about the music, folks
408;854.0;5.0;10.0;Who cares what Americans think about the Dixie Chicks views on war?  They are still the best all-female group in the world.  Texans need to pull their red necks out of their backsides and applaud a group that continues to get better.;The Best Yet
416;855.0;4.0;10.0;soft, beautiful sound, touching lyrics, I am so happy the chicks are back. They are the full package. They are multi-talented. Please don't waste your beautiful voices and music. George Bush is just not worth it. Two years ago, this country was in a scary place. I think people are beginning to wake up, so please stay with us. Your talent is rare and beautiful.;lullabye
420;856.0;5.0;10.0;I love to hear muscians come together to form such great sound and harmony. Forget the politics involved -if you want, just appreciate their talent.;Beautiful Music
421;857.0;5.0;10.0;The songs in this album Taking the Long Way are awsome.  Dissent is a vital part of democracy and when that is stifled we can no longer consider America the greatest country on earth. It is even more courageous when that dissent may have an affect on your income and you can continue to 'tell it like it is'.;Saying What Needs to be Said

When I buy a new cd I will listen one time all the way through then just maybe listen to the songs I like after that.  With this cd I have listened at least five times all the way through.\n\nWhile I love the whole cd, my three favorites are: ""Not Ready To Make Nice"", ""Silent House"" & ""Baby Hold On"".\n\nWhether you like or dislike the Dixie Chicks for whatever reason, you are missing out buying this cd!";Excellent Dixie Chicks CD!

444;861.0;5.0;10.0;Over time, I have noticed the quality musicianship--such great fiddle playing-- of the Dixie Chicks, and Natalie's impressive voice, but this is my first Chicks' CD. I was thoroughly hooked on first listening!\nMy eclectic music tastes-- everything from Bach, Yo Yo Ma, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, the Beatles, and Norah Jones-- have been further expanded by the Dixie Chicks. Even if you don't usually listen to country, open your ears and take a listen to this one. You may become hooked, as I did.\nOr just buy it to support that an American should be able to express an opinion, whether you agree with it or not, without receiving death threats.;"Don't think you like ""country""? Chicks defy stereotypes... take a listen"
445;862.0;5.0;10.0;I don't give a hoot about their politics, I love these gals! Great music, fantastic personalities. You cannot go wrong with this album - it has country roots, with a little California veneer. Watch out Stevie Nicks!;I love these ladies!!!
449;863.0;5.0;10.0;The Dixie Chicks have come back! Yippie! Sure it reviews their last couple of years but listeners can relate on a personal level too.

465;866.0;5.0;10.0;"The Dixie Chicks are back with a strong collection of songs. If you are a fan of their fun music like ""Goodbye Earl"", then look somewhere else, you likely won't find anything on here that compells you. The album is largely a pop/rock album, abandoning their country roots. This album feels natural to listen to, a blueprint of where the girls are now. Rick Rubin produced the album. The first single is the defiant ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" which attacks those who were against them for Natalie's comments about the Iraqi war in 2003. The whole album is solid but highlights include ""The Long Way Around"", ""Easy Silence"", ""Baby Hold On"", ""Bitter End"", ""Silent House"", ""Favorite Year"", ""Everybody Knows"", and more. Definately a solid album that asserts their identity.";Solid effort

478;868.0;5.0;10.0;I actually bought this album because of all the hype over the argument with Bush, etc. I really enjoyed it, and I don't see how a group voicing their opinions about politics should hurt them. Anyway, it is a good album- especially for rocking in your car!;Dixie Chix
618;869.0;5.0;10.0;I would have bought this anyway, but if it sticks it to the right I will buy it twice and I DID.  Go DIXIE CHICKS.;Great Album
639;870.0;5.0;10.0;I wanted to only gave it 4 stars because I don't regularly listen to country music.  I heard it online.  The lyrics are so good.  The first 3 songs really captured me.  I wish the best for them.  I believe they were wronged and I am glad that they are moving on and doing well.;Loved it
727;871.0;5.0;10.0;"We pay the Dixie Chicks to entertain us.  They do a fantastic job of doing just that.  My father always told me to ""keep the people you admire at arm's length"".  What these ladies feel about the politics of this or any other country is their own business.\n\nThey sing some songs on this album that are from the very center of their hearts.  They have ""put themselves on the line"".  Do not ""cut off your nose to spite your face"" by avoiding this album.

Strong, forceful, with some of the most powerful vocals yet on such tracks as ""Baby Hold On"" and ""Not Ready To Make Nice""\n\nThis is a must have for Chicks fans old and new, and I predict these southern ladies will pick up a LOT of new fans with this latest release.";The Chicks Have Done It
864;874.0;4.0;10.0;"I'll begin by saying that I am about the same age as the Dixie Chicks. Younger than Martie and older than Natalie. I say this because I, like them, have had years that are great, years that I sometimes already don't remember all that much, years that I would love to be able to forget and years that more change occurred than I thought I could survive.\n\nThis CD is rather like that, with songs that encompass a period of time, where they too have had massive change and a hearty dose of sadness, anger, joy, boredom, fear and love, like most of us I suspect.\n\n""Lullaby"" for example, expresses the love for a child, as a father, something that I can understand and more importantly appreciate.\n\nThere are songs that express bitterness and anger. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and the apply titled ""Bitter End"". The songs in a way, remind me of a spouse saying goodbye to an about to be Ex. Not in the ""Let Him Fly"" type of way, but in a way where you find out your spouse has changed, or maybe you finally have seen him or her for what they really are. Maybe speaking more from my experience rather than theirs, but carrying that train of thought forward, when you realize that you and your spouse are no longer compatible and you have no interest in putting forth anymore effort into the relationship, the bitterness and anger tends to flow. These songs in a way are therapy for the Chicks. Some of the Country Western fans, in my opinion are the spouse you really want nothing to do with anymore. Maybe the feelings are mutual. Each of you has seen in each other something you can't stand and reconciliation would be as pleasant as a root-canal.\n\nOther songs, such as ""Silent House"" deals with such pain as loosing grandparents, or even parents to Alzheimer's.  ""Easy Silence"" brings to mind the comforts a partner can bring into your life in a world that sometimes can be hostile to a psyche. ""Baby Hold On"" ""So Hard"" and ""Favorite Year"" deal with working on a relationship and failed relationships gone bye.\n\nOther songs, such as ""Lubbock or Leave it"" and the ""Taking the Long Way"" convey what some of us feel, as we look back on our lives. The songs sing of the struggles to get where we are in our life.  They songs are a discussions of actions they and perhaps we have made along the way, reflection, remembrance and hopefully someday, redemption or reward.\n\nAnd ""I hope"" conveys a simple hope for a better world for our children. A world filled more with love than hate, a world with more laughter and less sadness.\n\nThe music is beautiful. Not all of the songs are outstanding, but I did enjoy all of them. I will give this CD four stars, as I think very few entire CD's deserve all 5 stars. Those should be reserved for instant classics or that music, which already has stood the test of time and earned that mark.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned, the CD is a type of therapy. This is not a all happy and joyful cd. This is a collection of music that ranges in emotion and moods that reflects most of our travels through life.";A reflection of living
932;875.0;3.0;10.0;I really don't give a [...] about the political views of any musicians.  Not the ones that agree with me or not!  I just want to listen to good music from good musicians.  I love the Dixie Chicks for all their talent but I can't hear their music from all their anger!  It's no wonder musicians and actors find Sucessful Living elusive!  They often seem to forget that the only reason they were ever allowed on stage to begin with was because of their voice, acting, or looks! Most normal people would never pay good money to go see a Congressman in concert!;Headed for Trouble
996;876.0;5.0;10.0;I am not a country music fan, but all this controversy made me curious. I listened to the clips here on Amazon and was not too impressed, but decided to buy it anyway. I am glad i did. I'm not jumping on any political bandwagon here, even though I do think the way they were assaulted was just shameful. Understandable perhaps but shameful anyway. I'm glad I got it because it's just terrific music. But you have to listen to the lyrics. There is some real great poetry there. These three women, they are very good.;would buy it again
24;877.0;5.0;9.0;I'm not a fan of country. My favorite bands range from art rock types like Television and Talk Talk to highly-produced indie pop like Of Montreal and Broken Social Scene.\nThis is not a country album, not really. The country twang appears once in a while, and the voices are certainly Texan. But the music itself in a style that is more rock - the production is superb. Lyrics are a huge improvement from other Dixie Chicks albums - very little sap in this record.\nMuch of this record is about the Bush-bashing incident, and surprisingly they are able to write thoughtful lyrics about the incident that don't seem contrived or over-dramatic. This isn't by any means a protest album, if anything it's a free speech album.\nArtistically, musically, lyrically, this blows any prior Dixie Chicks album out of the water. Real country fans might prefer their popular debut, but for a rock fan like myself, nothing in the country vein satisfies the palate like this record.;Country-Rock Hybrid Brings Outside Fans
32;878.0;5.0;9.0;Before all the Rednecks started making noise I had never heard of the Dixie Chicks. Even after all the hoopla I didn't pay too much attention to them. I was watching their story on much demand and really liked what I saw so I bought this cd and was pleasantly surprised. Their voices aren't that spectacular but thier songs are sung with so much emotions and the lyrics are great. Thanks rednecks for bringing the Dixie Chicks to my attention they just won a new fan.;Not Bad
44;879.0;4.0;9.0;Truthfully I had never heard of the Dixie Chicks until country music fans decided to get ignorant on the news burning CD's and threatening lives about a simple anti-Bush opinion.  It made me take notice of the group and I'm so glad it did.  What fantastic music!  I immediately went out and bought their CD's.\n\nThis CD seems like a mix of country and rock and it's all together well done.  Each song seems so personal and filled with their life.  I will admit my favorite is 'Not Ready to Make Nice' not just because of the sc*ew you attitude but the pain they clearly felt about the situation and how they handled it with...as they say in country...true grit.;Great CD
54;880.0;5.0;9.0;"First of all, I am not a country fan. I am not an American so I don't really get country songs, except if they are a little bit pop-ish and find their way to my country's radio play somehow. I know Dixie Chicks prior to the infamous remarks made by Natalie in 2003. I have their album ""Wide Open Spaces"" but it was a forgettable album for me. So, I am speaking with my position as a music listener, and try not to bring the 2003 event here.\n\nThis album is really amazing!!!! I must say that this is one of the best albums I have ever had for a long time. The lyrics are powerful. I guess what the girls been through for the past 3 years have made them stronger and better.\n\nIf people don't buy their records just because of what happened, it is a pity, since this album offers so many great songs. If I don't care about them before, I must say that the songs here moved me. I know the lyrics to some of the songs by heart now (""Easy Silence"" and ""Favorite Year"" are my favorite). Some of these songs even bring tears to my eyes, like the such sweet ""Lullaby"". I get my throat clogged when Natalie sings their ""anthem"" of course, ""Not Ready to Make Nice"". It's just wonderful feelings listening to this outstanding collection\n\nI'll be looking forward to Dixie Chicks' songs in the future. I guess the event becomes a blessing in disguise, 'cause they gather new fans. Like me ...";Outstanding Album ...
63;881.0;5.0;9.0;A must have for all fans. I bought this cd the day it was released and can't listen to it enough. All country fans will love it too. After all it did win a few Grammys. I can't wait for their next tour. I NEVER miss them in concert. It is one of the best shows you will ever see.;Dixie Chicks are BACK!!!!
77;882.0;5.0;9.0;fabulous from start to finish. It has a VERY subtle political theme that would be hard to detect unless you re looking for it. However, its their most personal, honest cd yet, and hands-down their best. This isn't an anti war CD and many of my friends, Bush fans alike, agree that the raw emotion and depth of the songs make this an excellent cd. Would highly recommend it.;ALWAYS IN MY CAR
80;883.0;5.0;9.0;"The Dixie Chicks had never gained my attention until they won the Grammy for Album of the Year. I then decided to go out and give it a listen. When I bought this album I noticed Rick Ruben produced this album so I was really interested. When the first track starts up ""The Long Way Around"" I knew I was in for a treat and that's just what I got. In this musical journey the listeners go country, rock, pop, gospel, and even a little ""doo-wop"". The Chicks have made a wonderful album and I look forward to hearing their past material as well as upcoming releases. Chicks you have found a new fan.\n\nStand Out Tracks:\n\nEasy Silence\n\nEverybody Knows\n\nFavorite Year\n\nI Like It\n\nI Hope\n\nOverall a Wonderful Album!!!!";A Trip Through Music
90;884.0;5.0;9.0;Greetings from Ireland on this International Women's Day.  Taking the Long Way is a really good album. Well the first half of it is - actually brilliant.  Second half I could take or leave!  I recently became a first time grandmother and learned the lullaby to sing to my twin granddaughters and for that I am grateful.  I admire the Dixie Chicks - excellent musicians all.\n\nSlinte\n\nAnne Rynne\n\nWest Coast of Clare\n\nIreland;RESPECT for the Dixies
110;885.0;3.0;9.0;"Note: Unlike many of the reviews on Amazon, THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THE MUSIC, NOT THE POLITICAL STUFF.\n\nForget the commercial hype, forget the stupid controversies, forget the scandal of the ""fixed"" Grammys, the MUSICAL bottom line is that what we have here is an... OK album.  Neither great not bad, just a good solid middle of the road modern pop country album.  Unfortunately, it is a far cry from the greatness of Wide Open Spaces.  Fortunately, it doesn't sink to the level of some of the ""hat acts"" albums.\n\nYou are a fan of THE BAND and love what these girls do?  No doubt you'll dig this album. There's no breaking grounds and it's the same old formula, but these chicks are talented and it's a good album so - YES - the great vocals, neat arrangements, pretty melodies, and catchy hooks are all there for your enjoyment. I liked it (but again, I like them).\n\nYou are a fan of THE MUSIC and loved Wide Open Spaces?  Perhaps look somewhere else; this album is a lesser quality of what these girls have done before, and there are MANY more far superior country albums out there that deserve your listening.\n\nDo your homework and don't let the Grammy pundits mislead you into thinking that this is the ""best"" album of the year.";An OK album.
133;886.0;1.0;9.0;This album is the worst mainstream piece of garbage I have ever heard. The only reason they won so many grammy awards is because the academy of music is a bunch of left wing liberals and they want to stick it to the president.\n\nReal good, basically your telling people its ok to bash your country while playing in another country and then we will reward you with a bunch of grammy awards for it.\n\nComplete drivel, these losers will never get a cent of my money.;This album is mainstream garbage
154;887.0;5.0;9.0;Too good of talent to be penalized for political comments.  Time to bring them back to the forefront;3 great women
155;888.0;5.0;9.0;Excellent Pop & Country music without being too much in any direction. So good that a certain G.Bush should get a listen!;Dixie Chicks Way
156;889.0;5.0;9.0;This whole CD is great.  Another one you can just pop in and let play.;The Dix Chix did it again!
157;890.0;5.0;9.0;Loved it.  Every CD I get from them I love.\n\nThey are truely talented ladies with a lot to sing, and say.\n\nThey got their point across in this one.\n\nI LOVE MY CHICKS!;Thats our Chicks
158;891.0;5.0;9.0;This is the best Dixie Chicks album ever!  I don't care what Country radio says - the album sales and Grammy nominations say it all!;Best Dixie Chicks Ever!
168;892.0;4.0;9.0;"Taking into consideration the many & varied responses to the 'Chicks'' music, I was most pleasantly surprised.\n\nHaving grown up under the spell(s) of such musicial groups as the Marshall Tucker Band, the Charlie Daniels Band, the Allman Brothers, and Lynard Skynard (plus MANY other artists & varieties); and having learned to play banjo [albeit not too proficiently], my expectations MIGHT have been rather lofty.  No matter, though, as the Dixie Chicks EXCEEDED my hopes.\n\nCome to think about it, though:  Since I tend to disagree (vehemently, sometimes) with the opinions of [George] W. [Bush], I ought to have KNOWN I'd truly enjoy this music!";More -- and BETTER -- Than I'd Thought to Expect!
186;893.0;5.0;9.0;"I bought ""Taking the Long Way"" when it was first released last May and would have easily given it a 5-star rating back then, based solely on the album's wonderful music.  Many other reviews, such as A.G. Corwin, have already articulately described the album and its music, so I don't need to repeat any of that here.\n\nHowever, I just saw the documentary ""Shut Up and Sing"" yesterday.  In addition to being a film on free speech, the documentary serves as somewhat of s a VH1-ish ""Behind the Music"" about the creation of this album.  The movie put many of the songs into their complex, emotional context, even for those already familiar with ""The Incident.""\n\nI just re-listened to the entire album today after having seen ""Shut Up and Sing,"" and I was even more taken with ""Taking the Long Way""s power, beauty, creativity, and, yes, brilliance.  Not only does this album stand alone on its own musical merits, the depth of emotions behind the songs are what truly make it one of the top albums of 2006.";A brilliant CD with great music
210;894.0;3.0;9.0;After repeated  plays this album grew on me but I am not sure it plays to the strengths of the group.  The Chicks sound like the band that Sheryl Crow would be in if she was in a girl band.  It's rock with a country feel - dare I say it - pop.  One thing I always loved about the Chicks is their gifted use of vocal and string instruments in conjunction.  This might as well have been a `Natalie-with -support' album as the vocals dominated - the instrumentation was good but unspectacular  rock.  There was an overuse of the electric  guitar.  The lyrics are good but again not as outstanding as we expect them of this group.\n\nI totally support growth in groups and I have bought every Chicks album.  If this is the direction they are heading on permanently then I think I will get off on this stop.  These girls are so much more talented than this album - it's the combination of great vocal and instrumental excellence that has always distinguished them.  I want to hear more of the first class fiddle and the syncopation that we have come to expect of the Chicks.  Where is all the fun gone?  This felt like Natalie's album even though the Chicks are a very talented  ensemble group.  Check out Alison Krauss and Union Station gals - consistently first class music that also likes to experiment.;Rock takes hold.
260;895.0;5.0;9.0;Buy the Dixie Chicks. They are awesome. Dubya is an embarrassment to the human race!!;Great CD
266;896.0;4.0;9.0;"This is different from the Dixie Chicks albums you're used to.  It's much more mellow with meaningful lyrics.  THe Chicks use this as a forum for the backlash they faced following their anti-Bush comments.  It is tasteful and not hateful in the least.  My favorite tune is ""Easy Silence"".";Easy tunes with great lyrics
269;897.0;3.0;9.0;Not great.  Just ok.  Too pop.  I really liked those gals when they sang their brand of country.  Maybe they have crossed over so as to find a more receptive audience.  Nonetheless, I bought the album in protest of Bush and as a show of support for the Dixie Chicks and their right to speak their minds.;I bought this as a show of support.
276;898.0;5.0;9.0;Once again I think you have a winner.  Classic Dixie Chicks.  Love this album.;The Chicks are the Best

354;900.0;5.0;9.0;This is my first CD I have of the Dixie Chicks and I love it!;Love it!
355;901.0;5.0;9.0;"This is the best of their work so far.  They have a wonderful mix of lyric/melody/theme/pacing/style.  Nothing repetitive or ""same sounding"" here.  Congratulations, Dixie Chicks, you win again.  There should be no controversy here, just good entertaining music.";Dixie Chicks score bigtime
358;902.0;5.0;9.0;The Dixie Chicks have outdone themselves on this new CD. The message is straight forward, and their style has gotten better with age.  I have listened to this numerous times, and it doesn't seem to get old.  I love their sound and the writing really hits home on a lot of great topics.;Welcome Back
389;903.0;5.0;9.0;Thanks Chicks for your strenght and courage,\n\nthe music is great as usual, and the words are excellent\n\nIt's great music from brave girls\n\nstill believing in the American Dream,\n\nThanks for keeping the Dream alive in these trouble times;Thanks Chicks for your strenght and courage
410;904.0;5.0;9.0;It took me a couple times listening to the album, but now it is all I listen to in the car with my son! Lullaby puts him to sleep almost every time!;Love it!
430;905.0;5.0;9.0;It's not just that I agree with the Dixie Chicks politics, this CD is just outright great.\n\nIf you're into their musical style, you will not be disappointed.;Awesome
431;906.0;5.0;9.0;If you are a woman who believes that it's okay to stand up for what you think and to take a different path in life then you will love this CD.;They just keep getting better!
440;907.0;5.0;9.0;great new album from the dixie chicks. red state or blue state is irrelevant - this band keeps stretching itself.  One of my best purchases of 2006.;great music regardless of your politics
448;908.0;5.0;9.0;"Thank you, Chicks, for taking your time, using your angst, and making a great CD for us. The fact that ""Lullaby"" and ""I Hope"" were used on television (in ""Charmed"" season finale and ""20/20"" special, respectively) are a testament to the powerful lyrics in their music. Additionally, the Dixie Chicks are sticking by what makes them great with songs like ""Not Ready to Make Nice""  and powerful story lines in songs like ""Favorite Year"". You need this CD in your country collection. You're gonna love this one!";Way to Come Back!
462;909.0;5.0;9.0;I can only say that there are few albums where all the songs are winners, and this is one of them. I applaud all the Chicks for their courage, and extraordinary talent. Natalie's voice is amazing. Frankly there has never been a female group of this caliber. They are absolutely the best!;it doesn't get much better than this!
480;910.0;5.0;9.0;This CD is written and sung straight from the heart of the Dixie Chicks.  Every song delivers a powerful message of love and hope as well as beautiful melodies.  I highly recommend it!!;One of Their BEST
622;911.0;4.0;9.0;I attended their Fly and Home concerts and they have to be two of the best I have ever seen (and I have been to A LOT of concerts in my life). Natalie has a stong voice and the lyrics are some of the best out there.\n\nWhile I think Taking the Long Way is a great album, I am tired of hearing about the controversy three years ago. I almost forgot about it, can't the girls? Maybe that's their point, it generally sells, doesn't it? I hope by the time their next album rolls around (2009 maybe?), they won't rehash this all over again.;Great album- better in concert
646;912.0;1.0;9.0;I received one of the CDs alexlee purchased to give away as gifts. The music was awful, the Chicks are traitors, and their fans are traitors, so all things considered, I burned it. Thanks, alex.;no thanks
705;913.0;5.0;9.0;Absolutely fabulous.  I can't stop playing it.  I'm so happy to see the Chicks rise above all the hoopla, hold their heads up high and carry on.;Well Worth the Wait!
725;914.0;5.0;9.0;"Wonderful lyrics and ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is Killer (in a good way)!";Boffo!
735;915.0;5.0;9.0;Well, have been a long time Chick's fan, highly anticipated this disc and it is the best recording I have heard in quite a while. The teaming of Rick Rubin with Mastering and mix engineer Richard Dodd has made my stereo sound better than ever. This how digital music should sound, most of the stuff today has distortion and is overamped, this manages to be loud yet rich.\n\n 14 tracks ,66 minutes of a wide variety of heavily layered tracks, you could tons of remixes of this disc.\n\n  Well, they knew country wouldn't work so they went for a pop based roots rock sound with some country in the bottom layers, pedal steel and banjo.\n\n  Their harmonies sound better than ever!!! Rubin prefers a dry recording, hardly any reverb and the vocals come across rich.\n\n  Bottom line, will sell like pancakes , but I don't know where this mix will get airplay;Aural Ecxtacy and great harmonies in a pop setting
747;916.0;5.0;9.0;What a great new CD from these talented chicks!  With John Mayer on lead guitar and Bonnie Raitt doing some back ground vocals, you can't go wrong!  This is a great CD!!!  It's got different feel from their other CD's, so have an open mind.  But, if you've missed the Chicks, this will fill your need!  It's fabulous!;Great CD!
757;917.0;3.0;9.0;"I have to say that I am disapointed by the Pop flavor of this album after the excellent country/folk harmonies on ""Home"". By far my least favorite of all the chicks work. Still, it's a decent album with a few stars, such as ""Lullaby"", ""Lubbock or Leave It"" and ""The Long Way Around"".";More Pop than Country
758;918.0;5.0;9.0;"Great tunes! The Chicks said what they needed to say, with music! The Chicks co-wrote all songs on the CD, and expressed themselves beautifully! Buy the CD and support the Chicks' right to speak their mind. Their courage is something to be admired... besides all that, the music is good! They are not your normal ""show-your-belly-wave-the-flag-redneck-fly-by-night' country singers that we are seeing so much of lately. They are TRULY talented!";Excellent
1034;919.0;5.0;9.0;"What very few negative reviews of this CD you see here have NOTHING to do with the music itself.\n\nThese reviews are from these Neofascist Cult of Bush members that amazingly still have not figured out that indeed Bush is GUILTY of being a Treasonous War Criminal.\n\nand that they are clearly in the ever shrinking minority.\n\nThe only thing Natalie Maine said was simply she was ""Embarrassed Bush was from Texas""  that's it! nothing more, and for just that these lunatic Cult of Bush members attacked, attacked and attacked them for years complete with death threats.\n\nThat is so disgusting on so many levels I wouldn't even know where to begin, but it is reminiscent of brainwashed citizens & brownshirts that defended such tyrants as Hitler & Stalin.\n\nThis CD is OUTSTANDING!\n\nand the ""Dixie Chicks"" have far more Huevos than the entire Bush administration of ""Chick""enhawks all combined.\n\n/bravo  and good for them for speaking truth to power and standing up for themselves.";Excellent CD
18;920.0;5.0;8.0;"You know the Chicks made it perfectly clear that they are not ""country"" anymore.  They are more of the ""pop/adult listening"" line of music.  All the people out there that believe that they are just showing their political views are right.  What happened to them was a tragedy.  I don't see the backlash happening to Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, or any other outspoken artist today.\n\nThe album itself was a great listening experience to enjoy.  It was completely different from their beginning albums and showed the depth at which they where not only damaged by what Maines said, but the growth that each has had from the experience of motherhood, friendship, and the fan mentality of ""George Bush"" is right.  I'd like to know now how many people out there still believe that he is right.\n\nThis album was a wonderful change of pace for any of the Chicks' fans.  The songs are amazing and I look forward to the next album.";Why is everyone so stupid?
22;921.0;5.0;8.0;This album is what music is supposed to sound like! It has great lyrics, vocals, and music.\nI know that some people have given it one star based only on their dislike for the Dixie Chicks as people--if you haven't heard the music, don't rate the cd!;AMAZING!
30;922.0;5.0;8.0;This cd is awesome!  Too bad for country media and ignorant country artists and fans.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks will shine no matter what.  FUTK!;Awesome
35;923.0;5.0;8.0;I really enjoyed this CD.  I have always like the Dixie Chicks, and they didn't let me down.  The melodies and harmonies are beautiful and the songs are great!;Personal, intimate, & fun
58;924.0;5.0;8.0;Way to go chicks...they nailed this one! Lyrics and melodies are fantastic. Track after track I love this CD.;Best Album Yet!
69;925.0;5.0;8.0;"After hearing the Dixie Chicks sing at the Grammies, I considered purchasing their CD.  I am glad I did.  I am not a ""real big"" country music fan but I like the message they send -- their voices and instruments are ""great"".  I would consider purchasing any future CD's.";First Dixie Chicks CD I have purchased
70;926.0;5.0;8.0;"Excellence again!  This is another fantastic cd by a great group of musicians.\n\nMy husband and I recently saw the movie/documentary ""Shut Up and Sing!"" profiling the Dixie Chicks and the making of this cd.  I had been a huge supporter of the Dixie Chicks before and after ""the comment"" about G. Bush.  After seeing the movie and hearing this cd, I am even more supportive of their music and their views.\n\nIt's amazing watching when you follow the last few years.  The first uproar from fans and others when the President was criticized by Natalie Maines, then the uproar died down a bit, but now it's as if the biggest and loudest critics have made a 180.  Those that hated the Chicks and would never play another cd again, now are frustrated that we are still in Iraq fighting a war that never seems to end.  Maybe the Chicks aren't so bad after all, they say.\n\nBut on to the music... this cd is terrific.  As always, the harmonies are beautiful; the instruments and the playing is fantastic; the lyics and songwriting tell so many stories - so seemingly biographical; and the Dixie Chicks are better than ever!\n\nDefinitely buy this cd if you haven't already!  You won't regret it!  :)";Excellence again!
82;927.0;5.0;8.0;I bought this CD after the grammies. Now I am a Dixie Chicks fan. I applaud their support and commitment to freedom of speech, and their courage to exercise that civil liberty. Plus, the music is good.;True Guts and good music

151;930.0;5.0;8.0;"Having been practically forced out of Country Music by the radio stations, the Dixie Chicks take a more mainstream/pop approach in this album.  ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" tells how they feel about the roller coaster that they have been on since ""The Incident"" (when lead singer, Natalie Maynes said that she was ashamed to be from the same state as George W Bush, as he was about to mislead the US into the disasterous War in Iraq).  Lots of raw emotion and worth the price of the album.";New Direction
183;931.0;5.0;8.0;this cd was awesome. Nobody in my family wanted to get it because of they're history but I just had to break down and purchase it. It is a fantastic cd but I wish they would just shut up about the past. Nobody in my family still plans on buying it.. I love this cd though.;As much as I disliked them for what they said
187;932.0;5.0;8.0;I've been a fan since the start.  This CD is very strong in lyrics and showcases their excellent talents.  Leaving to see them in Oakland in a half hour!!!;Getting Better and Better
199;933.0;5.0;8.0;"I liked their music but never bought an album until this one. My rating is more like 4.5 stars simply because there is one song I dislike that I skip but that is just my preference.\n\nI liked it enough to buy more albums after I heard this one. I find their songs very relevant.\n\nIt's also refreshing to encounter some women who are secure and opinionated enough to speak their minds without regard to ""how it looks."" I support them whether I would agree with them or not. It's coincidental that I do. (Since when did having a mind of your own and not following like a sheep make you ""Unamerican?""";first Chicks album
202;934.0;3.0;8.0;"Fairly listenable with a few very good cuts.  The first song, ""The Long Way Around,"" is right up there with their best.  While, as a whole, this album doesn't seem to quite measure up to their others, some of the songs are starting to grow on me, now that I am past my third listen.\n\nSeveral of the songs seem to refer to the right-wing media provocations perpetrated against them by the systematic efforts of the the country music industry - an industry that has no doubt made millions of dollars off them.  The corporate-orchestrated 'public' reaction to Natalie Maines' rather tepid and brief comments was obviously a shock to them and affected them deeply.  Well, if they are banished from the country music scene and lost some country 'fans' as a result, I say good riddance.  Besides, the Dixie Chicks are much more pop than country, anyway.\n\nSince they have, to some degree at least, fallen from corporate and popular grace, I would like to see them explore a bit more musically - and politically as well, for that matter.  They obviously have the talent to evolve in new directions.  Of course, that takes a lot of committment - not to mention, these days, body guards.";Apologizing or Standing Ground?
10;935.0;5.0;7.0;"A brilliant album which takes the Dixie Chicks in a slightly new direction musically, appealing not just to Country fans but across the whole spectrum.\nAll the fans will have a copy already but for anybody new to the band I would just say don't hesitate-this is sensational!\n""Not Ready To Make Nice"", especially if you know the history,must be one of the most powerful and evocative anthems of the last 30 years, up there with the likes of ""Bat Out Of Hell"" and ""Total Eclipse Of The Heart"".\nThis album marks the Chicks' first serious attempt at songwriting. If they can maintain the standard of ""Not Ready..."" it would put them on the level of the legendary Jim Steinman.\nHOT TIP- buy the double album. Disc 2 is a DVD containing 5 tracks from the AOL studio sessions where the girls are backed only by what seems to be the accoustic section of the band; also a sensational music video of ""Not Ready...."" and an in-depth discussion between the Chicks and producer Rick Rubin on how he took them in a new direction musically in the making of the album.\nThis has been well-worth waiting for!";NEW DIRECTION

280;937.0;4.0;8.0;"The Dixie Chicks have come a long way indeed after their blown-out-of-proportion anti-Bush statement three years ago.  Their latest album Taking The Long Way isn't a perfect listen, but it still provides some of the best country-influenced rock music in years.  Sure, this can't be really categorized as just country but the award-winning act has grown past that genre, especially after much of their dedicated country fans deserted them in disapproval of Maines' anti-Bush remarks.  The group's current global smash ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" blends beautiful songwriting with beautiful playing and singing, making it the standout track and most beautiful song on here.  Opening song ""The Long Way Around"" is an upbeat track about being yourself and doing things your way.  ""Easy Silence"" is a beautiful ballad about children.  ""Lubbock or Leave It"" is an entertaining response to all the band's deserters.  It's not much of a happy or fast release, but the fact the Dixie Chicks are saying a lot with Taking The Long Way doesn't detract from the album at all.  Regardless of one's personal feelings about this group, this is still pretty good music.";Not perfect but still good
291;938.0;4.0;8.0;"The Dixie Chicks have said a lot in the past three years since their now-infamous anti-Bush statements made international headlines.  In that long time since their last record the award-winning group has endured many commercial failures and backlash from listeners as well as fellow country music stars, but in 2006 they have finally delivered on Taking The Long Way.  The opener ""The Long Way Around"" is an engaging song about being yourself, doing things your own way and not following the crowd; it rides into the dreamy ""Easy Silence,"" a track inspired by one's children and the solice often found in them.  The standout single is, of course, the global smash ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" which discusses the Chicks' reactions to the blown-out-of-proportion retalliation brought on by lead singer Natalie Maines' famous anti-Bush statement; it's a little slow, but still thoughtful and introspective, and both music and lyrics combine to make a simply amazing track.  The remainder of the record after those first instantly likable three songs bleeds into a pool of gray due to dullness, though the hilariously direct ""Lubbock or Leave It"" gives Taking The Long Way's remaining bland material a good (and entertaining) kick in the seat.  In the end, the Dixie Chicks' new album isn't perfect, but it's worth giving a chance to.  Despite the many angry ex-fanatics, the Chicks still stand tall.";Not perfect but still interesting
329;939.0;4.0;8.0;"The hype surrounding the Chicks' Taking The Long Way came early and the award-winning but controversial group delivered a great album worthy of all the hype. It not only produced a smash No. 1 single ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" the record itself became a global hit. Some listeners say that the music is just watered down country-rock, or too political, or too boring, or too serious--but in the end does that really matter? Sure, it's not much of a fun listen (and definitely doesn't deserve a perfect star rating) because most of its material is so dark and introspective, but some songs like the delightful opener ""The Long Way Around"" are upbeat. The aforementioned ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the Chicks' response to the ridiculous backlash their famous anti-Bush statement made, and it's a great track with a great message. In the end, this act did take the long way around with this record so take a chance and make up your own mind. Remember: it's neither as good nor as bad as people are making it out to be.";Engaging album, but not perfect
369;940.0;5.0;8.0;So country radio doesn't play The Dixie Chicks anymore??  Well...fug 'em.  It's probably rock and rollers who made this album number 1 anyway.  Beautiful job, ladies.  This rock and roller will be looking forward to the next one.;Taking The Long Way
374;941.0;3.0;8.0;Its hard to imagine that this is the group that created such political heat.  They are rather ordinary, in the nicest of ways.  More enjoyable than country music played on the top radio stations, pretty harmonies and a couple of better than average songs.;fluffy easy listening
388;942.0;5.0;8.0;"I have been a Dixie Chicks fan ""from afar"" for many years -- enjoyed a lot of their music on country radio, but never purchased any.  Events over the past few years made me absolutely sure I wanted to buy to support their newest album.  I bought three copies -- kept one and gave two as gifts. This feels like a really personal collection -- songs about their lives and what moves them personally.  I love that they are both strong and determined (""Not Ready to Make Nice"" which I can't seem to play loud enough in my convertible -- and the strings in this song make me weak) and sweet and tender (""Lullaby"" and ""Easy Silence"") and finally, just REAL (""Everybody Knows"" and ""Voice Inside My Head""). They have really come into their own as artists and as women.  This is a terrific reflection of that maturity.";Strong and sweet

434;947.0;5.0;8.0;"Another AWESOME CD from the ""Chicks"".  I've always liked them, but after they made their voices known on how they felt about the war, I have grown to like them even more.  This is a GREAT CD.  It might even become the best one they've ever done.";Dixie Chicks Rock!!!!!!!

1007;955.0;5.0;8.0;"This is my first album purchase in 25 years. The last artist to hold the diverse Rock audience together was Michael Jackson (Thriller, 1982). But Jackson is merely a performer. He successfully blends musical styles, but renders ideology inconsequential. The Dixie Chicks are willing to offend people over ideology, a true Rock album.\n\nNevertheless, there is no such thing as the long way. When Rock musicians discovered that drugs and sex were the wrong way to seek God, they immediately renounced the part about seeking God. Dylan found God in 1979 with Slow Train Comin', but was unwilling to pay the price. Will the Chicks be willing to offend people by singing Christian ideology? Will they even get that far in their spiritual pilgrimage? Songs quoted below are not on the album, but are my response to it.\n\n""Caller called Casey at half-past four. / He kissed his wife at the station door. / He climbed into the cabin with his orders in his hand, / Saying, This is my trip to the Holy Land. / Fireman said, Casey, you're going too fast! You ran the block signal last station we passed! / Casey said, Yeah, but we'll make it, though, / `Cause she steams a lot better than I've ever known."" (Ballad of Casey Jones)\n\nThese angry young women refuse to accept the way things are. Well, things are not the way most country music fans think; but things are the way they are. There are many wrong ways, but no long way. There is only one way to beat the Devil. Life is long, youth is short. Johnny Cash said, ""It's all so fleeting, so fleeting.""\n\n""Through many danger, toils, and snares/ I have already come. / `Tis grace that brought me safe thus far, / And grace will bring me home."" (Amazing Grace)";Taking every wrong direction on their stormy way back home
14;956.0;1.0;7.0;"Taking the Long Way--should be called ""Taking the Liberal Sellout Way for a Pop Audience While Stabbing Country Music Fans in the Back""--is the Dixie Chicks' notoriously billed ""comeback"" album, after Natalie Maines ineptly ruined their careers by provoking the real, American patriots called country music fans!!!! It's impossible to separate politics and current events from the music on this CD since Taking the Long Way glaringly symbolizes the Chicks' defiant attitude towards those (real Americans and patriots) who demanded an apology from them for their anti-American, anti-Bush tirade on foreign shores in 2003.\n\nSince they alienated the country music fan base--where they rightly received death threats and had their CDs symbolically boycotted by country music radio stations--the music on Taking the Long Way is totally a 180 degree turnaround from the country on their prior CDs. The vast majority of songs on this CD are pop/rock, and as such, they egregiously appeal to a new audience, that audience being those in the more liberal, blue states with an appetite for thoughtless pop/light rocky music--the complete opposite of the patriots, real Americans and conservatives making up the country music fan base. The Chicks' calculatingly necessary shift to the musical left was born not out of artistic ""merit""; it was pressured on them by a country music fan base that Maines segregated/antagonized with her anti-Bush tirade. Likewise, because of their shunning of country music fans, their tour last year saw many E-M-P-T-Y arenas and sub-par ticket sales with only liberal, big cities really going to their concerts!!!! Taking the Long Way also debuted with the lowest number of first week sales of ANY of their albums.\n\nThis treasonous shift to pop music is seen instantly on the first song, The Long Way Around. Though it begins subtly like a country tune, it's clear they plotted a rockier tune due to the overpowering basslines and speedier guitar ""licks."" The lyrical content of The Long Way Around is also planned to appeal to a stereotypical liberals' school of thought because of the shamelessly outright rejection of traditional values espoused in that wreck of a song. Maines sings, lewdly, about smoking (obviously some illegal or self-destructive substance) with hippies and also repels the honorable, traditional virtues of her high-school classmates from Lubbock, Texas, for settling down and raising families with their husbands!!!! Predictably, impressionable, liberal apologists will find merit in the song's quaint resolve set to a hopeful melody.\n\nFrom there, the album's ALL downhill in a worsening, downward spiral as the Chicks furiously plan to attract liberals with their suspicious, newly found values system and remorselessness about Maines' anti-Bush tirade. In Not Ready to Make Nice, Maines scornfully sings of berating Bush all over again if she had a second go at it!!!! Contradictorily, Maines defies reconciliation, then wonders why the heck she keeps paying the price of being hated by a large segment of patriotic Americans, and rightly so. Also disturbing in the song's lyrical content is Maines' admission that her tirade against Bush was totally unwarrantable hatred of a perfect stranger and her plans to tell her daughter that it's ""ok"" to do so. When Maines sings, ""I'm mad as hell,"" she's clearly using her continuous upkeep of her anti-Bush controversy as a maneuver to generate interest around her band.\n\nDespairingly, simple-minded liberals will misguidedly credit Maines for what they misconceive as her ""standing up"" for what she believes in. But, the impartial listener will sentence her for being so arrogant that she presumes the world revolves around her and her little controversy. Also noteworthy in that song is the feint-but-audible rock guitar that's prominently used to underscore Maines' resolve--again, verifying the theme that the Chicks have basically turned into a rock/pop outfit.\n\nThough I analytically went into detail on only two songs, I could've just as easily dissected other songs like Easy Silence (comfort in family interspersed with complaints about war and radio stations), Everybody Knows (paranoia and insecurity about being in the spotlight), Bitter End (irreconcilable partings), or Lubbock or Leave It (ridicules Maines' southern hometown of Lubbock, Texas, with scorn of liberal elitism). But, I focused on The Long Way Around and Not Ready To Make Nice to make a convincing case and convict the Chicks for writing an album with a political agenda.\n\nThough the Chicks insecurely made their first, brittle foray into writing some songs, they didn't independently write this record, getting help from liberal radicals like Sheryl Crow. As such, the songwriting quality is noticeably lowered from CDs like Home. This album is just a phonily dressed-up version of the girls exercising their martyr complex, as in assuming that they've been ""through hell"" because of Maines' foot-in-mouth slur against Bush, yet it reflects on them as a CD wherein they presume that their rightly deserved backlash somehow elevated them to the status of ""heroes,"" totally furthest from the truth.";Taking the Long Way is such a political Album that it reflects Maines' Axl Rose-like Martyr Complex & Bush Derangement Syndrome!

25;959.0;5.0;7.0;This album is absolutely amazing.  Full of such heart and talent it becomes difficult to decide which track is the best.

""I Hope"" is an incredible song and I'm so glad they included it on this cd,it's a good closing song.  Great job ladies!!!";Chicks Rule!
31;961.0;5.0;7.0;The music and sound of this album is incredible.  I'm not a traditional country music fan, but the Dixie Chicks have created an incredible and touching album here with winner after winner.;Home Run Sound for the Chicks
37;962.0;5.0;7.0;I heard of the Dixie chicks when their lead singer Natalie Maines voiced her opinion against President George Bush's Iraq policy at a concert in London. I thought they were a girl Rock band because they look more like Pop/Rock artists than a Country music group. I have listened to their previous albums but I have never bought them because I am not a Country music fan. I like 'Taking the Long way' best because their new style of music is more to my taste than their 'twang' music. Although it has a 'Country' feel it sounds like 1970's classic Rock. This mix of different genres makes their music original. They said they were influenced by the Eagles and California Rock. This type of music appeals to me. It is why I bought this album. Nothing to do with their anti-Bush comment ( with which I agree ). Some people bought their cd in support for them but I don't purchase an artist's record for political reasons.  The Dixie Chicks have talent and it shows in their music. I was glad to hear that they had won 5 Grammys.\nMy favourite songs are 'The Long way round', 'Silent House'( they co-wrote this song with Neil Finn of Crowded House. It is also on the new Crowded House album called 'Time On Earth'), 'Voice Inside My Head', 'I like it' and 'I Hope'.;Great album
43;963.0;5.0;7.0;i will ALWAYS love the chicks - but this cd took a little getting use to. definitely a new style. a little dark. came to love it!;chicks?
8;964.0;5.0;6.0;"Saw the D C's on ""Storytellers"" and it inspired me to pick up the CD. My tastes lean toward guitar based, song oriented classic rock (Beatles, Zeppelin, Who etc). I was impressed with their musicianship and the songs seemed ""hooky"" enough to take a chance. I've received the CD and I must say this - ""Silent House"" is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I have ever heard. It does what music is supposed to do - move you. When Natalie hits the high note in the chorus, it just melts me. Love that song. (The rest of the disk is quite good too !)";For those who like to listen !
61;965.0;4.0;7.0;"I don't think I would have purchased this item if the Dixie Chicks were not boycotted for their dissent of the president and the Iraq war. It's a bad day for democracy that individuals who dissented against this war are labelled unpatriotic and like the ""Dixie Chicks"" marginalized.\n\nThat said, I was pleasantly suprised that I really enjoyed their music and I will look for other albums by them.";Support dissent
72;966.0;4.0;7.0;"This is a wonderful album. To call it a revival of the old art of American protest music wouldn't be fair to all those who've been doing it under the radar all these years, but the Dixie Chicks have thrown themselves into a rich world. Very enjoyable.\n\nThe song ""Lubbock or Leave It"" is perhaps the best.\n\nMy only complaint: sections of the album lean in the direction of navel-gazing. The DC have been very courageous so far, but I'd love for them to focus on the objects of their anger, rather than on their own feelings about the fact that they're angry.";Good Old Protest Music (but not quite Woodie Guthrie)
76;967.0;4.0;7.0;"I have in my CD collection many genres of different types of music. I always like to say I listen to everything from Amadeus to Zeppelin. One thing I try to avoid when people ask me what kind of music I like is to label. In the past, I had avoided two areas of music; Rap and country. I could never get myself interested in modern Country and I will never consider Rap to be music. Period. Rap seems to be all about rhythm and the beat. No melody. Most country today just sounds too ""twangy"" to me; too much emphasis on the table top slide guitar.\n\nI had heard songs from Dixie Chicks and their music transcends the easy and lush melodies into something that perhaps my ancestors sat and listened to on a quiet night by a campfire. This album is no different.  Much has been said about the music here, so I will let the music speak for itself.\n\nNow for the other reason I respect this band. (I can hear you groan, conservatives) I just watched ""Shut Up and Sing"", the documentary about the penalty for speaking your mind. One of the many protesters said, and I paraphrase, ""It's all right to speak freely in America, but by God don't do it publicly.""\n\nOK....so, then what would be the point of free speech? What he didn't add to that was ""Don't speak publicly about things I don't like.""\n\nIf this comment about Bush had been said by a Rap artist, would we have heard about it? Or even cared? The fact is that the Chicks' music lands in a genre that is dominated by people who took to heart the immortal words of George Bush way too literally. ""You're either with us, or against us."" That seems to have been directed not just at our enemies of the Taliban.\n\nWhat I find ironic is that the young men and women who have died for our country in the past, did so for the purpose of giving us the freedom to speak our minds. About anything. Despite public opinion.\n\nI applaud the Dixie Chicks for using their right to speak without even knowing they were. They should not have had to worry about Natalie's words. Ironic that this was said it in England.\n\nBut, look what I've done. I'm writing a music review but I can't get away from the political hurricane surrounding this band since Natalie's remark. (She says it again the same way years later in the same venue in London, the ""scene of the crime"")\n\nIt should be about music. This album puts me in a great mood, whether it be a banjo driven dance fest or a soft moving lullabye. It reminds me of days gone by. It also shows what is missing from most Country artists and their die-hard, stubborn fans.\n\nHeart.";It's about the music.

88;969.0;5.0;7.0;A must have for all Chick fans.  Very good songs!!!!;Dixie Chicks Taking the Long Way
97;970.0;3.0;7.0;"First off, I must say that this album is by any stretch of imagination a ""good"" album - it is NOT a ""great"" album by any means.\n\nMy tags for ""great"" albums are reserved for breakthrough albums that stand the test of time. By that measure, I can only think of their last CD ""Home"" as deserving of that title.\n\nThe main problem with ""Taking the Long Way"" is that its too slick for its own good, and theres a sense of desperation about the whole enterprise that even hard core fans must probably notice. I'm not even Republican, but after listening to ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" even I was a little perplexed about the need to record such a song. Its a staggering insult that the track was chosen ""Song of the Year"" at the Grammys ahead of Mary J Blige - it just makes no sense.\n\nMusically, consider this CD an amalgamation of their ""Fly"" CD alongwith some nasty Gretchen Wilson thrown in. This is not necessarily a good thing. If anything, the only song here with a memorable chorus is ""The Long Way Around"" (Track 1). From that point on it all goes downhill. Many would not agree with me, but I realy think that they could have done much better. ""Easy Silence"" is dry and lifeless, and their ""Voice Inside my Head"" leaves you speechless for all the wrong reasons.\n\nConsider this a failure on their part to specify what genre they belong to. Sometimes, role-defining is not a bad thing. The problem here is that this is supposed to be country music, yet not. And the ""not"" part makes the Chicks want to dress it up in alt-rock and bluegrass ballgowns, and most of the time it just does not work. When it does, such as on the opening track, its fine, but does that justify the work as a whole? No.\n\nThe one thing holding this mediocre album together is lead singer Natalie Maines' voice, which is as timeless and flawless as ever. I seriously think she should consider a solo career - that would make the dreary road the Dixie Chicks are on a thing of the past, and would give us something that this album is not - a classic.\n\nTo cut a long story short, get this if you're into the Grammy hype (which you probably are). If not, recognize this as yet another ""filler"" entry into the annals of country music - and the sad part is, this isn't really even country music.";The Long Way to Good, not Great
107;971.0;1.0;7.0;what made them great were their lyrics and beautiful sound together.  now they've just gone and made fools of themselves and decided to write songs to defend themselves and make them seem like they are victims.  if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen, girls!  this album lacks EVERYTHING that made them famous.  i think the lack of support at concerts, ie cancelations, and lack of air play on country stations says it all.  we all know the only reason they got ANY awards or air play on contemporary stations is because of their politics, which they are NOT in the business of.  say what you will, but you know the truth whether you admit it or not.  i would dare say that 90% of the people who bought the album don't even listen to it.  and now they've made a DVD too?!?!  are you kidding me?  talk about trying to milk an old cow to death.  like their biggest supporting group's name, MOVE ON, chicks!;so far from their beginnings

301;979.0;4.0;7.0;"Far from perfect, the Dixie Chicks return with their highly anticipated Taking The Long Way. Since their controversial, blown-out-of-proportion anti-Bush statement three years ago country music's most controversial act gets it right with their latest album. Though it's not their best and it's far from being really country (meaning it shouldn't appeal much to what's left of their now-meager traditional country fans), Taking The Long Way isn't a flop either. First single and major radio smash ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is brilliantly written and performed well, and it's the standout. Opener ""The Long Way Around"" is an upbeat track about growing up and realizing following the crowd isn't something you have to do. The lulling ""Easy Silence"" is a listener pleaser as well for its soothing coos and introspective I-have-children-now lyrics. The remainder of Taking The Long Way isn't too memorable (the likeable ""Lubbock or Leave It"" cracks jokes at the detractors of the Chicks after their infamous Bushwacking statement, making it an entertaining and laughable listen), blending together into a pool of well-produced gray, but there are a handful of songs really worth listening to.  Dedicated fans of this award-winning act should be happy with this record, and those ex-fans distracted by the anti-Bush statement should set aside their political beliefs for once and focus on what Taking The Long Way is, which is pretty good music.";Not perfect, but still good
339;980.0;4.0;7.0;"Some people just don't get the Chicks.  So they criticized Bush and got a huge amount of backlash for it--they're free to express their patriotic preferences just as anyone else is.  Taking The Long Way's first single, the No. 1 poetic smash ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" is superb, if not as spunky as most of their previous singles have been; but what, can a group not experiment and put out serious music?  The Chicks deliver on Taking The Long Way whether listeners are willing to let them or not.  Sure, it's not exactly a fun, upbeat listen since the material mostly consists of somber tones (with a lot of it responses to the retaliation they received after they made their political views), but it's consistent, even if it's not as commercial-driven as their previous works.  The aforementioned ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" is the standout track here, of course, but ""The Long Way Around"" is just as telling and enjoyable, though more entertaining due to its faster tempo.  ""Voice Inside My Head"" is another upbeat tune that's got some potential in becoming a single.  The album does have its tepid moments, but doesn't almost every other out there?  The award-winning group is at least being heard and delivering a message with their cooings, which can't be said much about ""Promiscuous"" or other mainstream Hip Hop musings being played today.  The end result after listening to Taking The Long Way Around shows where these three Chicks stand as a group both musically and personally, and if that's where they want to be that's up to them, not you.";Serious music, but still enjoyable

744;985.0;5.0;7.0;"While most of America would rather rant on and keep the hate up against these beautiful and talented girls there fans that are true to them and there new found fans can see this album in the objective way that radio is lacking. This album is amazing in the writing of ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" all the way through every single song. While some want to only see the one line ""I'm Mad As Hell"" in the single ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" they are lacking the objectiveness and brains to see that what they are trying to get across is how they felt, how Natalie felt about ""a mother who would teach her daughter to hate a perfect stranger"" and quite frankly I would like to know why a mother would shove her view down her childs throat to hate a person she does not know. The other part is ""how could some go as far as to take those words and write her a letter telling her to shut up and sing or her life would be over"" and I'd also like to know who in there right and objective mind thinks they have a right to threaten a fellow American for there views and opinion. I certainly thought this nation was founded on the freedom to feel what you want and to speak what you feel not to go and follow everyone else because if you don't you might ruffle some feathers. No the girls have every right to what they wrote in these songs and to make it apparent that they were deeply hurt by the drastic measures of hatred and violence that were pointed in there direction. The people who choose to remain hateful are the one's who eventually will have to answer to there maker when they go from this life to the next because he will not accept the simple I had a right to hold onto a hate for these three beautiful women who are not only talented but also bright young women who do better at moving on then  the rest of the radio and half of country music's fans. As for banning the music off of radio stations let me make this perfectly clear if a radio station is going to appoint themselves the choice of what we hear on radio and what we don't hear go right ahead because quite frankly I don't care to listen to a radio station that wants to dictate to me what they want me to hear rather than play a request. Radio is not the last line of defense to hear music. I own enough cd's that I can mix and make enough cd's of a mix I want to hear that can and will last me a lifetime. So Radio as far as I'm concerned if you are going to be as Unamerican as to dictate farewell forever I won't miss you at all. That is my opinion and it is my right to have just like it was the girls right to have without having to wonder if the rest of the world is gonna hate us for our thoughts and opinions.";Dixiie Chicks are back and better than before!!
745;986.0;4.0;7.0;"Some say there is no such thing as bad publicity, but sometimes that isn't always true, like, say, when you offend the majority of your fan base and have your records pulled from the radio like the Dixie Chicks did at the start of the Iraq War. Of course that was back in a time where is you were against the president, you were anti-American, and now, a couple years later, even some Republicans have been piling George Bush leading him to the lowest poll numbers by a two term president not named Richard Nixon.\n\nBut even before their comments, the Chicks have been alienating country radio by drifting to more bluegrass and pop sounds on their last album Home. That tend continues on their latest outing, Taking the Long Way, as the group even brought in noted rock and rap producer Rick Rubin who had much success resurrecting the career of Johnny Cash with his American Recoding sessions. But unlike the American Recordings, there are no cover songs as the Chicks wrote all the songs on the album with help from artist as diverse as Keb' Mo' and Sheryl Crow.\n\nAt the beginning of the album, most of the songs seem to focus on the infamous comments mentioned earlier, most notably on the aptly titled Not Ready to Make Nice. So if you think the Chicks have soften on their position on this administration, the title pretty much says it all and they even touch on the backlash with lyrics like, ""How in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that they'd write me a letter sayin' that I better shut up and sing or my life will be over."" But that theme doesn't linger long as songs quickly transition into more familiar territory like relationships. Then the album ends with the I Hope, a gospel song that was released last year to benefit those hit by Katrina.\n\nAs the Chicks move away from traditional country, they start moving into genre, the best result being I Like It, a song that sounds influenced by the girl group of the sixties. Then there is the album opener, The Long Way Around that sounds exactly like Learning to Fly by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers but with fiddles. Lullaby is as soft as the title suggest. Baby Hold On hits the emotional intensity of songs like You Were Mine from their first album. Really the only song here that would have fit on previous albums the brilliantly titled Lubbock or Leave It which has that same pure rage as Sin Wagon. Unfortunately some songs on the album suffer from being uneven where the verses are great but the chorus doesn't hold the intensity or vice versa. This is most apparent on Silent House where the chorus just rubs me the right way.";It's Been Two Long Years Now Since the Top of the World Came Crashing Down

15;988.0;5.0;6.0;"""New Country"" has never been a genre of music that I could embrace wholeheartedly. My own belief is that ""real"" country music, on the whole, is long since dead. My feeling is the same regarding ""real"" Rock 'n Roll. Simply put, there will never be another Country artist as pure or influential as Hank Williams Sr., just as there will never be another Elvis, or Beatles.\n\nIn the 90's, when Grunge and Rap infested the mainstream Rock and Pop airwaves, a lot of music listeners looking for ""normality"" turned to New Country. For the most part I was put-off by the majority of these New Country artists. It seemed that just about every hick from the sticks was being pushed as the next big thing. Heck, just slap a big hat on some fool with an empty head, give him a big belt buckle, and he's a star! I found most New Country to be contrived and silly. However, there were a few truly great artists to be found in that mixed bag....\n\nThe Dixie Chicks; Garth Brooks they ain't!\n\nThe Dixie Chicks have proven that in this age of empty New Country, real talent will still rise to the top. While they certainly cannot be described as Country in the classic sense, their music is undeniably REAL and in my opinion, truly great!\n\nMy music collection consists of a variety of styles and genres, but is primarily centered around Rock. Even so, I found ""Taking the Long Way"" to be my favorite album of 2006. This truly is a well written, masterfully produced, and perfectly performed collection of songs! It's a rarity to find an album these days that is almost entirely good, but I would venture to say that there isn't a bad song on this entire CD!\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nGet the version with the bonus DVD! Great live performances!\n\nJM";Great music is not bound by genre!
20;989.0;5.0;6.0;After first listening to this album, I was a little disappointed. I have been a fan since their first album, and this wasn't at all what I had expected it to be.\nAfter listening to it again though, and paying attention to the lyrics, this album has become one of my favorites. I really do appreciate what these women have gone through, and the strength it would take to put themselves out there like they did with each of the tracks on this album.\nIt's unfortunate many can't over come opposite beliefs, to actually sit down and see this album for what it is. Good.;Didn't care for it at first...Then loved it!
21;990.0;5.0;6.0;Honestly, I can count the albums on one hand from the last few years that I love every song, and this is one of them. Every song on this album, together form a finished complete work, which is so much more than we can say about most albums. I don't listen to country normally, but I have always appreciated Natalie's special extremely country voice. This album is unique, tactful, poignant, touching, personal, but at the same time, strong and assertive. After all that craziness about the bush comment, they came back to touch a whole new group of listeners with a fabulous album. Buy it now.;Top 5

39;994.0;5.0;6.0;I bought this when it was first released, and I love it just as much as the day it arrived--maybe more.  I often get sick of albums that seemed great in the beginning, but I don't think that could happen with this one.  It is too perfect.;Still Amazing

53;997.0;5.0;6.0;"I'll admit this is the first Dixie Chicks album I bought. But after seeing the documentary ""Shut Up and Sing"", which featured songs from this album, I had to but it. I was not disappointed. Given everything the group went through the past 3 years, this is a great comeback album for them, and I am glad they swept the Grammys with this one.";Great Comeback Album
68;998.0;5.0;6.0;Highly recommended. Some songs look like they were fillers. Nevertheless, I like the band and there is enough to warrant the CD;Great album overall
79;999.0;5.0;6.0;"Indeed, Dixie Chicks took the long, pains-taking way toward creating a top-flight work worth more than Grammys.  I like singer-songwriters with brains.  Maybe it wasn't brainy at the moment to make a political comment in another land, but Natalie Maines was saying what a lot of other people were only thinking.  Now, with this CD, ""Taking the Long Way"" the Dixie Chicks are broadening their bases appealing to other audiences.  More, they stand their ground musically and otherwise:  ""Not Read to Make Nice.""  There is introspection and reflection along with the defiance.  Check out the words in ""Silent House,"" ""So Hard,"" and ""I Hope.""  And daddy Lloyd Maines I'm sure is proud of the continued consistency and precision.  The Dixie Chicks are growing up before our ears.";The Chicks were right
86;1000.0;5.0;6.0;I said it was the album of the year last May to all who would listen\n\nGlad to see others agree\n\nIt's my favorite of their four albums actually\n\nWide Open Spaces and Fly are fun, but are lacking\n\nHome was terrific\n\nbut Taking the Long Way is my favorite;Album of the Year
124;1001.0;2.0;6.0;"I've always loved the Dixie Chicks' music, and Natalie's voice is amazing, and despite my disagreement with their political leanings, I am not disputing their talent. However, I can not in good conscience call this album one of their best, nor is it Grammy material. How can you possibly compare this album to Fly, Home, or Wide Open Spaces when only a couple songs on the CD display their real talent? This clearly is not of that same caliber. While some may say the Grammy for ""Best Album of the Year"" is a vindication, I say it's nothing more than a sham further proving the agenda of Hollywood to control public opinion. There are so many talented artists out there right now that I don't know how anyone can possibly say they earned this award with the current album when it is such a disappointment. It's unfortunate.";Hollywood's Tail Wagging The Dog...
127;1002.0;4.0;6.0;"I thought this album was quite pleasant for the most part.  I bought it on the strength of ""Lullabye"", which caught my ear on an episode of Medium.  What a beautiful song!  Overall, the harmonies on this album are lovely.  I wasn't as impressed with the lyrics, which were often weak, but the music blew me away.  I don't think I'd have given this record of the year, but it's definitely a nice addition to any collection.";Loved Lullabye
128;1003.0;2.0;6.0;"I'd resolved to take an objective view of this album *as a musical work* rather than as a political comment and, well, that's mostly impossible - because the ""Chicks"" have apparently turned their musical career into what Thomas Paine once called ""a political hobbyhorse,"" in much the same way as Michael Jackson devolved into self-absorbed whining about the consequences of *his* own actions, in ""Leave Me Alone"" and ""Privacy.""\n\nIgnoring the embarrassing juvenility that is ""Make Nice,"" this is pedestrian post-Brooks pop-rock country - well done but not precisely what one could call outstanding, much less the ...best music release of 2006?  Please.  The selection of ""Long Way"" as ""Album/Record/Single/Country Album/Performance of the Year"" is even more embarrassing - as evidence that the ""Grammy Awards"" have become little more than a soapbox for cheap political activism.  Much like the aforementioned single, as it happens.\n\nSo the folks in charge of the Grammys have subordinated their entire 2007 program to expressing their political views (Bravo, guys,) while curious listeners can only respond to ""Taking The Long Way"" with a bewildered ""This...is IT?"" Not specifically the gem that the hype suggests.\n\nCorrine Bailey Rae - that stunning new talent with a voice like a Stradivarius - has got to be shaking her head in amazement like the rest of us.  But I suspect she, for one, is a musician classy enough to take a snub without whining over it into a studio microphone.\n\nP.S. - Oh and BTW: I never, ever sugar-coat a review for the sake of ""Helpful"" votes.

161;1005.0;5.0;6.0;I've been waiting for the group to come out with another CD and this one is a good one.  It's more Pop than Country.;About time
164;1006.0;5.0;6.0;This is great music and their incredible musical talent speak for themselves.  This album is full of pain, anger, redemption, hope and strength.  5 grammy nominations and the 9th best selling album of 2006 even with limited to almost non-existent airplay--nuff said!  If you really want to see the incredible depths of their talent and musicianship, catch a live concert! These women are awesome!!!!!;A rocking album --the Dixie Chicks Rock!!!!
196;1007.0;4.0;6.0;A superb album, the Dixie's just keep getting better as they draw from new experiences in their lives.\n\nHave just seen them in concert and the songs sound just as good live as they do on the album.\n\nTrack 6 - 'Lullaby' - is hauntingly beautiful.;Class Act
279;1008.0;4.0;6.0;"What a great CD - the Dixie Chicks are definitely back and in full force. Full of angry lyrics, this CD is very much crossover - there's probably not a single track that would qualify as ""country"". The title track, as well as ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", and ""Silent House"", cowritten with Neil Finn (Crowded House) are all very catchy and memorable.\n\nThe only reason for less than 5 stars is that some of the bridges are a little predictable.";they're baaaaaaaack!
333;1009.0;4.0;6.0;The chicks are always a wonder, but...\n\nThis release was way too rock for my taste. The electric guitars and drums drowned out the Chicks. Bluegrass was better! The message, however was as gutsy as ever... more so! Bravo Chicks for speaking out!;Bluegrass is Better

464;1012.0;5.0;6.0;The songs, their amazing musicianship, the entire production is almost flawless! Absolutely their best album to date.  I can't recommend it highly enough.;Their best yet!
776;1013.0;5.0;6.0;"I lent this CD out to a friend at work on Thursday and today, Saturday, I sure wish I had it here to play. My wife and kids are visiting relatives in Texas and it sure is lonely here in Florida right now. I'm seriously considering going out and buying another.\n\nBefore I bought this CD I figured it would be at least pretty good since, after all, most will agree the DCs are pretty talented musicians... BUT after a couple of listens I was REALLY blown away buy the emotional depth and honesty of this music. This is one of the two best cds I've heard this year...maybe in a couple of years. The other is ""Other People's Lives"" by Ray Davies.\n\nA few songs DO deal with the so-called ""incident"" such as ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" but don't overlook the chillingly emotional\n""Silent House"" which deals with Alzheimers disease and is certain to bring a tear to your eye. The honest and gut-wrenchingly emotional longing on ""Voices in My Head"" is also guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine (is it about abortion? a child given up for adoption? or something else?. ""Lullaby"" is a soft, ethereal...well...lullaby. Some very beautiful lead AND harmony vocals on this one. ""Favorite Year"" is another song which displays an honest longing for the excitement and wonder of the past BUT ""I Like It""  is almost the antidote to this song in which the girls realize the importance of living in the moment and making the most out each and every moment no matter what the situation. ""I Hope"" is, of course, a beautiful anthem that, I expect, the world may be hearing for years to come.\n\nListen to this album closely. It contains many textures and much to think about. As I said, I had no idea I was going to love this cd so much. If you give it a chance, you will love it too.";This Is Ture!!
910;1014.0;5.0;6.0;Since the fanatics are bound and determined to have all the one-star reviews removed, I'll try a new strategy: I'll give the Dixie Chicks five stars and still call them out for being ungrateful, unpatriotic hacks who hold most of what America stands for in complete contempt!\n\nBecause, really, all the fanatics are concerned with is the appearance of greatness, despite the lack of it on this CD or anything the Dixie Chicks say or do.\n\nI'm really surprised by the number of reviews from people who bought this CD and give it a high rating only because of the Dixie Chicks' political views.  How many are wimpy NPR-listenin' city folk liberals driving around in their SUVs and feeling all warm and smug because they have a Dixie Chick CD in their glove box.  Not that they actually listen to any of that...but they support them.  You are truly lemmings running for the cliff.\n\n(Let's see how long this review lasts).;You are all mindless swine
964;1015.0;4.0;6.0;"I'm a big fan and supporter of the Chicks.  This long awaited album is great, but not awesome.  I say this based solely on the fact that i felt that there isn't a really strong ballad on the CD in the vein of ""Cowboy Take Me Away"", ""Don't Waste Your Heart"", or ""I'll Take Care of You"".  Other than that, this CD is great.  My favorite is the anthem to good times ""Bitter End"" where friends are parting ways but take one last night to celebrate the memories.  Welcome back DCX.  See them on tour this summer at any cost!";Great but not awesome
970;1016.0;5.0;6.0;Not being a huge Chicks fan, I probably would not have given this album a listen.  If not for the dopes trying to boycott them that is.. lol.  I saw a news report and they showed some toothless fools spouting off about boycott and how these gals were traitors for some stupid coment they made about George Bush.\n\nWell.  I just had to listen and what I found was gold.  The album is awesome and these women have some serious talent.  I did a little more investigation and found that the big brooha is because the lead singer said that she was ashamed she was from the same state as George Bush.\n\nWhat?  You freaking must be kidding me.  People are bent about that???  LOL at rednecks.\n\nGet real folks.  Worse things are said about George every single day.  The fact that these gals had the guts to speak up before the war only shows that they had better sense than most of us.\n\nShoppers, please disregard the fools that tool on in here to lay some stupid political boycott propoganda.  Most Americans are just not that stupid.\n\nThe album is very good.  You don't have to take my word or anyone else's word.  Just go to VH1.com and search for Dixie Chicks and watch the video of the song for free.  Make up your own mind and then decide if you want to buy the album.\n\nPeople come in here and say they want these women to shut up and stop expressing themselves.\n\nShame on people that don't understand what it is to be American.\n\nGod bless the Dixie Chicks, our troops and freedom of speech.;Awesome tunes...
11;1017.0;5.0;5.0;"The Dixie Chicks' came back with a #1 album and a whole ton of attitude. Opening up with the title track, Natalie Maines and her gal pals take us through heart felt confessions and foot stomping pissiness. I had heard them perform ""I Hope"" a few weeks before this came out on some concert show and since I did like their last album and pretty much love Natalie's attitude, I figured I'd buy this one if I found it priced cheap enough.\n\nBut then on the season finale of the TV series Medium, they kept playing this haunting little song with groovy little harmonies, ""how long do you wanna be loved? is forever enough/ is forever enough?"" and I fell in love. Imagine my happiness when they announced at the end of the show that the music was from the new Dixie Chicks' album. I ran out and bought it the day it came out and I love it. The song is called ""Lullabye"" and as of right now it's my fav on the album.\n\nOn top of those two there is some kick butt stuff on here including ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" where she addresses her public's opinion of her or the public who disdains her, and her unapologetic opinions on Bush and the state of the world are addressed in a few other songs but no where as good as that one. The whole album is great with fun harmonies, heartfelt lyrics and an unabashed attitude which I love.";No Holding Back
12;1018.0;5.0;5.0;"Okay, yeah, this album is a departure from the light-hearted serious and is more just plain serious.  That doesn't mean it's not an absolutely wonderful piece of work.  I will forever be a Dixie Chicks fan for this reason - HOW can you possibly go wrong when you have two wonderfully talented musicians (Emily & Marty) with an equally talented musician (Natalie) that also has such a strong vocal ability??? You just can't. Dixie Chicks have never been ""the norm"".  Their unique style will always be what both sets them apart AND puts them on top.";Grown Up, Insightful

16;1020.0;5.0;5.0;First off I'll say I haven't liked their twangy previous work and I hate their politics so I was biased against liking this album. I picked up this album after hearing an interview with the 'Chicks on NPR. I was surprised how much I liked the songs they included in the interview, until the name Rick Rubin was mentioned. I tell ya, that guy's amazing. He really knows how to draw something special out of the musicians he works with. I hope they work with him some more because they're really on the right track musically.;Rick Rubin does it again.
17;1021.0;5.0;5.0;"This is a great album!  The Dixie Chicks are very talented.  The fact that they are able to express their life experiences in song is a distinct advantage.  I think that the ""rush to judgment"" against the Dixie Chicks was wrong-headed and cruel.  Their displeasure with GWB is now being expressed by a majority of Americans!";Taking the Long Way
28;1022.0;4.0;5.0;"This album hasn't left the Amazon Top 100 in a year and a half.  That pretty much speaks for itself right there.  This album is a strong effort by the Chicks.  It's right up there with ""Home"", but I don't feel it's as strong as ""Fly"" or ""Wide Open Spaces"".  That certainly doesn't take away from this album.  Those 2 afformentioned albums are borderline masterpieces.  ""Taking The Long Way"" isn't quite a masterpiece, but it's a very good album.  More polished, more mature, more adult-oriented subject matter and themes.  It's part of the evolution, and I'm glad to see the Dixie Chicks survived the backlash the media created.  Yes, the media created it.  Ask 100 people if they support the Dixie Chicks and what they said, and you'll get 90 ""Yes"" answers.  However, the media portrayed them as poison.

NOBODY was talking about this album all year, and nobody was suggesting people buy it because it is ""so great."" What we have here unfortunately, is a gang of liberal Grammy voters who thought it would be exciting to try and stick it to the former fans of the Chicks in the south and mid-west (oh, and who just happen to have voted for the President twice) by wrongly awarding an un-deserved and totally un-earned Grammy award to them. Oh, what fun it was to see them onstage accepting their Grammy award...ha ha ....what redemption! Had this truly been a great album, I would gladly heap praise on it.

Other than the one standout single, the album just moves along with one song running into the next.  Don't get me wrong; I love the Chicks.  I love Natalie Maines' voice and the tight harmonies.

382;1042.0;4.0;5.0;In Taking the Long Way, the Dixie Chicks show that they are a versatile group, but a number of the songs seem to reflect the musical style of the collaborating songwriters as much (or more) than the Chicks' own musical style.  The result is an album that which is much less country than previous albums and at times can be fairly generic.  After a few listens, three or four of the songs have grown on me, and the album is still good, solidly played music, but as a country fan, I think it falls short of other albums the Chicks have made.;Malleable Sounds

However there is not one great hit, like ""Cowboy take me away"" or ""Wide Open Spaces"", on this cd.  They seem a little bitter in some of their songs, but overall it is good Dixie Chick music.  I think we all need to move on, and just enjoy the music.";Pretty good, but no major hit
815;1044.0;5.0;5.0;I love Thin Line!!!. I don't know why it's only a limited bonus track when it should have been on the wide release cd and even a single. It probably would have received a warmer reception than Not Ready To Make Nice. Although a great cd, Taking The Long Way is mostly a moody, slow paced cd. Thin Line is a fast song that lightens the mood but still has the same tone and message of the cd.;Thin Line Turns A 4 Star Album Into a 5 Star

But setting that aside and listening to this as simply a new CD reveals a new sound for the Dixie Chicks, but some fine music nonetheless.\n\nThings kick off with ""The Long way Around"" which quickly finds those wonderful harmonies for which the Dixie Chicks are known carrying the day.  Sure, the song has a bit more of a backbeat than the Chicks of old and the fiddle and banjo are less prominent, but this is a great song that simply sounds wonderful.\n\n""Easy Silence,"" is a more pensive number in which lead singer Natalie Maines reflects on the backlash that followed ""the incident"" and speaks to someone (her husband?  her child?  God?  all of the above?) who helps take her pain away.  The melody is gorgeous and the song has a string underpinning that is sumptuous but never sappy.\n\nOverall the sound of the CD can vary from song to song with subtle country touches on tracks like ""Everybody Knows,"" a more straight forward rock feel on a song like ""Lubbock or Leave It,"" and a gospel choir on ""I Hope.""  All told this album opens up new doors for the Chicks -- doors that would have remained shut had the country audience that once embraced them hadn't turned out to be fair weathered friends who can't cope with anyone who doesn't share their political view.";Forget the Politics.  Just Listen.

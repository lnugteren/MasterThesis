3;1.0;1.0;398.0;The first release of this movie is truly a masterpiece. If you can get that release/version you will not be disappointed. However, I am at a loss for words.  This is the 3rd copy of Tottoro that I've owned.  The previous were the original, Japanese with English subtitles, and the initial release in the US.  This last version is totally remastered. Different voices for all of the characters.  Completely different script.  The initial magic of the movie is lost.  The original was set in the past with an appropriate vernacular and cultural reference,  The current version brings the reference to a modern vernacular which removes the more simplistic life of the setting of the movie. They even changed the japaneses with english sub titles version.  The environmental sounds are much improved, however. Disappointed is a huge understatement.  Does anyone know which is the best version of the original that is dubbed in English?;This is not a re-release. The script is reworked.  The voices are different even the song at the beginning is a different singer
0;2.0;1.0;7.0;"The new English dub, with Dakota Fanning, misses the point of the story and changes the underlying meaning. Now it's just two whiny girls complaining about moving into a new home,because their mother is sick. They even go so far as to call the ""guardian of the forest"" a ""troll"". That is the difference in the translation. Guardian into troll. Seriously?";Rewrite of the english dub
170;3.0;2.0;265.0;"First off, I just want to say that I love Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's work tremendously. And for the most part, Disney's done a good job bringing their films to America. But, they were bound to screw up somewhere. This is where they did.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful film with a great story and lovable characters. It's one of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies. So, if you're reading this, you're probably asking yourselves ""Why only two stars?"". Well, I saw this version of the movie on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) with their celebration of Mr. Miyazaki. I was appalled.\n\nMost of you probably know that this film was released in the US once before by Fox. Except for the fact that they didn't release it in wide-screen format, they had it down. Disney went and trashed a wonderful film.\n\nFor starters, the lead character, Satsuki, is voiced by Dakota Fanning. Her performance was by far the worst. Sometimes Satsuki would be moving her mouth, but no words were coming out, if only for a second. At other times, she had too little emotion in her voice to do justice to Satsuki's current actions. And Dakota's sister, Elle, voices Satsuki's sister, Mei. Mei is supposed to be four years old, but the way Elle portrays Mei doesn't make her sound that way. Both girls voices sound too American and not believable. This is probably my biggest argument with Disney's release of Totoro.\n\nNext up, we have everybody else's voiceovers. For starters, Pat Carroll as Granny. I'd say that she was okay, but definitely could've been done much better. Then Tim Daly as the Father. Again, it was okay, but still could have been better. And yes, Frank Welker as Totoro and the Catbus. One is the title character, and the other is probably the most imaginative character in the story. For Totoro, Frank made him sound too ferocious. He is the king of the forest, but he's still cuddly! And he takes good care of Mei and Satsuki. I think he should have made Totoro sound a tad more friendly. As for Catbus, when I heard it my jaw dropped and I screamed for mercy. It sounded a lot like Stitch, from the movie Lilo and Stitch, (and in Lilo and Stitch 2 we hear Dakota again and sounds nothing like Daveigh Chase, the original Lilo, but that's another matter), and it made Catbus sound way too creepy and weird. I think the only voiceover I can agree with is the Mother, voiced by Lea Salonga.\n\nLastly, I just can't see why Disney couldn't have kept Fox's voiceovers. They were great quality and believable, and if you watch both versions you'll probably agree with me. Whoever decided to do this movie again with these horrible voiceovers was probably one of the following. 1) He/She was deaf. 2) He/She is a Dakota Fanning fan. 3) He/She was high, drunk, or both. I just pray that John Lassetter or Hayao Miyazaki will see this and file a lawsuit.\n\nThe only logical reason you should buy this DVD is either because you're getting it for a three year old who can't talk and won't care, or because you want the Japanese version of the film, also on this set. I'm buying this DVD for the second reason alone. If you don't care about watching this in Japanese, then I suggest scouring the internet for the discontinued Fox edition of the film, which is my plan.";"Listen to what I have to say before you vote ""NO"""
227;4.0;1.0;266.0;If you are a fan of Totoro (and what right thinking individual isn't!) then you may want to leave this DVD release on the shelf come December 3...In Japan, Totoro was graced with a spectacular DVD release featuing multiple dialog and subtitled options, as well as featurettes, artwork, and options for both full screen and letterbox versions...i the meantime, I would recommend this version ONLY to friends with small children who have not seen the film before.  The print quality of the VHS version was quite good and the dubbing job is excellent, considering the shabby treatment that most Japanese animated films recieve.  This is, first and foremost, a film of remarkable beauty and warmth.  It is precious and timeless.  By all means take advantage of the low price and share it with children.  But for your own collection, you will most certainly want to wait for the (cross your fingers and send those letters now) Disney Edition.;"This is a PERFECT movie; this DVD release is NOT"
120;5.0;5.0;203.0;"I had heard good things--great things--about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO for years. I still avoided it. (I tend to avoid anime. My husband puts some on: I leave the room.) Plus, it looked as if it were for kiddies.\n\nI am an idiot. I could not have been more wrong.\n\nTo summarize it--well, look around. The reviews are full of that: Father and two daughters  of the Kutsakabe family move to countryside in Japan (circa 1950's) while their mother is recovering in a hospital (from some unspecified ailment, maybe TB?) and the girls discover they are neighbors to magical ""trolls""--totoros--three of them, small and medium and very large! They learn the wonders of their new environs with the Totoros and they get a happy ending regarding their family situation, but in a way that will make you both smile and get moist in the eyes.\n\nNothing complex. It's what the writer/director/artists do with this simple premise that adds up to soooooooooo much more.\n\nThis film taps into the warmest, most human, most loving, gentlest, dreamiest bits of my young self that still hides inside my middle-aged self. It reminded me of what it was like to\n\n~have a dad I adored and who cared selflessly for me\n\n~ be young and see enchantments in the world\n\n~explore and be carefree physically\n\n~have fun with the simplest, new things, like a fresh bit of produce from a a plant in a pot or from someone's garden--which seemed like magic to me when I was young), or from a bath or from climbing a tree\n\n~be young and lost and afraid without family nearby\n\n~worry a beloved parent might die (as I feared when I was very, very young, like Mei, and my Papi was hospitalized.)\n\nI understand some of the critique about the vocals, but, geesh, get past it. It's hardly an issue in light of the amazing animation (just watch the girls, the little things, the details, that so absolutely prove that the artist(s) have observed young kids very, very carefully), the playfulness, the delights of the Totoros (I can't watch Chibi Totoro and not giggle. Physically unable to stop myself from just letting loose with a cascade of heeheehees!).\n\nIt's a movie which opens with slow, establishing scenes of this new place for the family, but which soon utterly enraptures you with these darling girls and the weird but lovable Totoros and the kind, distracted Papa. The scene with Mei on Big Totoro's furry tummy is pure perfection. Watch her legs, the way she lays there and plays with Totoro's face. The way she scoots. The gorgeous bonding the ensues. The restfulness.\n\nAnd the scene at the bus stop/catbus stop: Wow. Look at the way the shadows and light are done. The hilarity of O Totoro and his leaf hat. The joy of raindrops on an umbrella. The sweetness of sleepy Mei and the unselfishness and kindness of Satsuki.\n\nThe scene with the night ride: Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Who wouldn't want to be five or six again and ride on a Totoro's tummy through a moonlit night, over rice fields and camphor trees?\n\nIf you have high BP, this movie will settle it down, it's such a bit of grace pouring on you. If you want something beautiful that fills you with a sense of nostalgia: This is it.\n\nFeel young again. Feel magic. Feel joy. Watch MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO.";An enchanting viewing experience: gentle, sweet, humane, amusing, MAGICAL!
194;6.0;5.0;169.0;I have been a huge Miyazaki fan for nearly twenty years now, but I am ashamed to admit that I have only now seen MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO for the first time.  The reason is a good one, as reasons go:  it was the last important film by Miyazaki that I had not yet seen, and I was saving it for a special occasion.  I love seeing again films that I have loved the first time through, but there is always a special magic to seeing a film for the first time.  Unfortunately, I now no longer have any Miyazaki films to see that I haven't already seen (at least until he finishes his work-in-progress, which has been given the tentative English title HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE).  Fortunately, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was worth the weight.\nHow does this film compare with Miyazaki's finest films?  This is a hard question, because he has a large number clustered at the top, all of them excellent.  I would be hard pressed to say this was better or worse than any of a number of others.  However, each film is distinguished from the others by the mood and tone of the film.  MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO may be the gentlest and most peaceful of all his films.  True, the girls have moved to the countryside with their father because their mother is in a nearby hospital recovering from a rather vague illness, and the forest is haunted, but the illness is never perceived as especially worrisome (except near the end, when a slight cold prevents her making a brief visit home, provoking a crisis with her daughters), and the spirits in the forest are remarkably benign and benevolent.  There is nothing like the ecological apocalypse in THE PRINCESS MONONOKE and NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, or the parents who have been transformed into swine or threatening spirits of SPIRITED AWAY, or the armed conflict in CASTLE IN THE SKY.  The world in this film is a loving world, all the way down to a remarkable creature that is a cross between Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat and a school bus (literally).\nMiyazaki's animation is truly in a league of its own, and I mean that as strongly as possible.  It has been decades since the Disney studios were capable of a fraction of the more challenging sequences that Miyazaki seemingly animates with ease.  For instance, the wind and storm the first night the children spend in their new home display effects that Disney hasn't attempted since the more marvelous scenes in BAMBI.  The way the wind is portrayed as moving through the tops of the trees, the hint of spraying mist, the manner in which the wind moves like a wave over the grass, the shuttering of the house under the assault of the air, are all things of remarkable artistry.  Even more remarkable is that after this brief display of mastery, Miyazaki doesn't feel the need to build a huge storm with rain and lightening, but has the wind subside and give way to brilliant white clouds sailing across a moonlit and starry black sky.\nOf all Miyazaki's extraordinary gifts as an animator and a storyteller, his greatest virtue might be his patience, and this is something he holds in common with many of the Japanese animators.  American animated films are almost always frenetic affairs, in a great rush to fill the screen with activity, and in a hurry to get to the next part of the story.  American animated films seem to be more interested in where they are going than in how they are getting there, while for Miyazaki the journey is the far more important part of the film.  Certainly one reason for this is the distrust of the American film industry of the patience of the viewers, as if they are in abject terror of small children squirming in their seats if the story doesn't get a move on.  Miyazaki, on the other hand, respects his viewers, and is confident that they won't give up on a film simply because the story moves at a steady pace.  In MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, one of the sisters will begin to enter a room, look from one side to the other, take a step, look around again, and gradually and slowly discover what is inside.  In many American films, a child would simply explode into the room and that would be it.  As a result, every moment of the film becomes a discovery of marvelous and wonderful things.\nI would say that this is a very special film by a very special filmmaker, except for the fact that for Hayao Miyazaki special seems to be the norm.;Another masterpiece by the world's greatest animator
64;7.0;1.0;92.0;"Let me start out by saying I LOVE My Neighbor Totoro! That being said, I HATE this version of it!! I'm sure this is great for those who've never seen the older(original?) version, but for those of us who have, I'm sure I speak for most when I say ""What the hell?"". No offense to the Fanning sisters, but I prefer the original actors voices better. Also, the dialog is not completely the same. This is by far my daughter's favorite Miyazaki film, but we wish we would have known this wasn't the original BEFORE we wasted our money. Do yourself a favor and try to get the old version, it's much better!";Totoro, where are you?
21;8.0;1.0;45.0;"This review is not for the movie itself, which is, like all Miyazaki movies I've seen, beautifully done with wonderfully believable characters and excellent stories with morals that never pit characters in a ""good vs evil"" dichotomy, and the BEST and most adorably accurate portrayal of sisters I have ever ever ever seen in my life, this review is specifically for the hideous english dubbing done by Disney. I love love LOVE My Neighbor Totoro but he use of very well known actors for so many of the voices takes away from the realism of the characters (much like The Office chose not well known actors for the characters giving it a less ""acty"" feel). DIsney americanized the dub so much that it makes me feel like I went to an aquarium and looked through a peephole to see anything. Having grown up with the (probably not perfectly Japanese, but much closer) 20th century dub- which when they asked to make cuts and change what the characters said Miyazaki apparently sent back a Katana that said ""No Cuts""- this Disney dub was a huge disappointment. Taking out so much of the Japanese culture really left big holes in the story. Understandably, some of those holes cannot be filled without knowing the culture itself (such as the statues Mei is near when she gets lost, and the crab she draws for her mother) but other important qualities like the interaction of the children with the grandmother and the spirits, seemed lost; it felt much more like a cartoon than a genuine story.\n\nI just spent 80$ on a used version of the old dub and I'm not even upset about the money if it means I get the depth that is so deeply missed.";Wonderful, beautiful movie, Horrible, hideous English dubbing
214;9.0;5.0;104.0;It is depressing to have thoroughly enjoyed a film or book, and find that it is has become fashionable to pan the work because of the packaging and skip over its contents.  That Fox chose to treat 'My Neighbor Totoro' as a children's film, fitting it into the television aspect ratio and providing dubbing that was aimed at that audience, will displease some purists.  However, it isn't going to displease many children who suddenly have access to a beautiful work with strong positive values and a marvelous insight into Japanese culture.  Speaking as overweight, over aged child, it didn't displease me either.  If you are a purist, however, be warned.  This is a production intended to be viable at the price of a children's video.  If you are expecting the benefits of a general audience DVD, you will be disappointed.\nSatsuki (10), Mei (5), and their father have moved into a rural setting so that they can be close to their mother, who is ill (tuberculosis?), and is resting at a nearby hospital.  The film talks about the girls experiences, mundane and magical as they wait for the time when their mother can return.  Part of writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's brilliance is in not turning this into a tragic story or morbid story.  Instead, we see the children's excitement in their new home, and the close affection that interpenetrates their family life.  Only then does Miyazaki introduce the theme of the mother's illness.  This helps us to keep focused on the children's strength, rather than any sense of impending doom.\nWhen Mei chases a strange animal that looks like a cross between a rabbit and a teddy bear into the woods, she falls down a hole (just like Alice) and find a giant fluffy creature called a Totoro, who may or may not be 'the lord or the forest,' but in short order is the lord of our hearts.  The Totoro is magic at its best, soft enough to sleep on, able to fly about the forest, grow giant trees and summon a cat bus that will always take you where you need to go.  As a child's imaginary playmate should be, the Totoro is playmate, friend, and protection.  For the two children, the Totoro and its other spirit friends are the creatures that shout love, the powers that keep things from falling apart.\nThe film is quite honest about the feelings of these children as they cope with their own fears for their mother.  It is rare that a film speaks genuinely for children in this predicament, and attempts to set an effective coping model.  This is special.  It lifts the story to the level where it has something important to say to such children without making it the least bit preachy.  In thinking over the film, I find that what is really magic isn't the Totoro's amazing powers, but the relations between the human characters.  They are many and all think nothing of helping each other and sharing.  Perhaps the real message isn't about Totoro's that live in trees, but the Totoro's that live in our hearts and the hearts of our friends.  Highly recommended.;"""He plays a magic flute in the sky"""
210;10.0;3.0;92.0;"First, let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of ""My Neighbor Totoro and the works of Miyazaki.  I will let the other reviews speak to the merits of the film.\nHaving said that, I could not have been more disappointed with this DVD.  Here are some of my complaints:\n1.  No letterbox!  I want to see the whole movie in its full glory, not cut up to fit our television screen space.  On the cut version is presented on the DVD.  Maybe some people would prefer non-letterbox--if so, why not offer both?\n2.  No Japanese!  Another major flaw in the presentation is that there is no language option where you can listen to the original Japanese voices with subtitles.  Considering this is a DVD, both options should have been offered.\n3.  No extra materials!  How about some extra content, including some pre-production drawings?  Or some information regarding the original production.\nI am glad that this movie has been released in the U.S., but shame on Fox for producing such a shoddy product.  I think consumers have come to expect certain features to be available on a DVD that is not available on VHS.  The three things mentioned above are very simple things that would have tremendously improved the quality of the movie.\nI would recommend the movie highly to anyone who have not seen it.

220;11.0;1.0;82.0;Where is the Japanese?  I have not been so dissapointed in a long time.  It is absolutely disgusting that with all of the versatility of the DVD format Fox films would not include a Japanese track on this film.  The movie was already in Japanese!  There is no good reason whatsoever that they would remove the Japanese track.  I am amazed and shocked.  I advance ordered it because the whole point of DVD's is that the problem of not being able to find a copy of a foreign movie in the original language was supposed to have been solved years ago.  I never would have possibly guessed that they would go to all of the trouble to remaster the movie for DVD and then step back into the stone age like this.  This movie absolutely should have included both an English and a Japanese track.  This is one of my favorite movies.  I have been looking forward to this release for a long time.  I am astonished.  I am near to tears.  Do not order this edition of this movie, please.  Send Fox Films a message.  Just order something else please.;I returned it unopened

232;13.0;5.0;84.0;"This is an excellent childhood story unrivaled by any since ""Peter Pan"". The plot involves Satsuke, a girl on the cusp of womanhood, moving into the country with her father and younger sister Mei, where she discovers a child's realm of wonder and make-believe running in parallel to the adults' mundane everyday existence. The family's rickety cottage is filled with easily frightened dust bunnies, and deep within the tangle of roots and branches, in a safe hiding place only a child can access, Totoro, a benign forest creature, makes its lair.\nThe story is a real jewel, simply, elegantly told. The art is of extremely high quality, excellently detailed, bright and clean. The characters are especially well-depicted, complete with expressive body language and realistically animated. In part because of the excellent dub, they are all sympathetic and deeply human, instantly recognizable as real people around us.\nEspecially evocative is the portrayal of the children's make-believe world, full of things and places that are there only if you believe in them, like the giant Totoro and his entourage of two tiny, roly-poly furballs, and the magnificent ""cat-bus"" with great shining eyes and two mice announcing the next stop - the exact place you want to go.\nA fantastic, enchanting examination of a child's mentality, that is also a mainstay family film.";Totororrific!

87;16.0;5.0;41.0;"What more can be said about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.\n\nIt's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot (""dust bunnies"", or ""soot gremlins"", depending on which dub you watch) scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard. And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I used to own one who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts.\n\nThe story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime. What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included.\n\nMY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.)\n\nThe movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the ""best"" dubs they've ever produced, with everyone involved, particularly Lisa Michelson and Cheryl Chase as Satsuki and Mei, turning in very fine performances. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. Many longtime fans of the former version were furious, declaring that the Disney version is an abomination of something from their childhood. However, I beg to differ. As someone who fell in love with TOTORO with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production is entertaining in its own right. The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though).\n\nAt first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. Elle is actually the juicier of the two, although that's mainly because she's blessed with a great role to begin with.  That isn't to discredit Dakota, though; my only quibble is that she underplays some of the more emotional scenes toward the end, but otherwise I have no problems with her performance.  The only issues is that neither are Lisa nor Cheryl, but that's just it:  they are bringing their OWN interpretations to these characters, not copying the originals.  The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus.\n\nProbably the only (minor) false note of Disney's dub is in the handling of the opening and ending songs. The translated lyrics are the same as in the FOX version, but the singer is different. Unlike the warm tones of the nameless singer who delivered ""Hey Let's Go"" and the showclosing ""Totoro"", respectively, these songs are instead handled by one Sonya Isaacs. Her voice is competent enough and she hits high notes appropriately, but her approach to the opening song has more of a ""gung-ho"" attitude and as such, is a bit less charming. She does fare a little better in the ending song, particularly in the bits that she harmonizes parts of the last couple of verses. One other difference is that the songs sound more crisper and vibrant in the new dub but come across as somewhat scratchy-sounding in the older one. So, basically, there are pros and cons to both versions: one is more soothing but more ""old"" in terms of clarity, while the other offers technical improvements but not so much on the singing end.\n\nOtherwise, however, there really aren't any major quibbles I can find with Disney's dub of MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. There is no denying that the FOX dub is a classic of its time, but the newer reinterpretation is by no means a disservice. While the arguments over which version is superior may rage on until the very bitter end, it's obvious that the creators of both dubs are fans of Miyazaki, and it shows in both takes. Each takes their own approach to the story, and are neither better nor worse. They simply are what they are.\n\nFOX's initial release of MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was a pan & scan DVD which contains only the Streamline dub and zero extras. The first two-disc DVD set from Disney provided a widescreen presentation of the film as well as the original Japanese language track. So in a way, it seems curious that a *third* DVD release is planned. What really makes it worthwhile are the extras on the second disc--this is the most that TOTORO has ever had in any of its DVD incarnations. Of course, if you already own either DVD release, then this newest edition may not be necessary.  If it's on BluRay that you want it, though, then your only choice is going to have to be the one that's available.  The Fox dub is still not there, but on the flip side, the content of extras are great and the picture quality is magnificent -- this is the best TOTORO has ever looked, period.\n\nEither way, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too ""sophisticated"" for cartoons) will enjoy it too.";Marvelous Miyazaki masterpiece (regardless of whatever language it's watched in).
226;17.0;2.0;53.0;I must concur with the other reviewers of this DVD... I love this movies, and indeed bought a DVD player that could play the Original Japanese DVD release. This 'Fox' release is a poor substitute for the original film. In specific this production is Pan & Scan, and while you might be able to follow the plot, the beauty of the Miyazaki film is lost. Indeed the trimming of the picture often makes the color composition off. Also the DVD seems to be a bit over saturated, and a little off to the red side. Other basic things lacking: captions (of any form - even English!), other languages (Spanish, French would have been nice - this is a region 1 DVD after all, likewise it would have been nice to have the Japanese - some kids out there are learning this language), and indeed any extras. Given all of this the DVD is quite poor, but the story is wonderful... So get the best copy you can afford and enjoy.;Wonderful Movie, poor DVD

14;19.0;3.0;18.0;"Totoro is one of my favorite movies- and I am 32. I stumbled across it when my first child was a toddler, someone at the indie movie store I go to recommended it as I really like Miyazaki.\n\nThe OLDER dubbed version is MUCH better. I was surprised at how much difference the newer dubs and Disney ""updates"" would make, but Disney really made it worse. The old version is a solid 5 stars and I have absolutely no complaints with it whatsoever.  The newer version has different music in some parts, like they made it more modern, but the classic, simple music of the old Totoro was much more pleasant. Also some of the imagery seems to be more flashy and Disney-fied, which I can't understand because Studio Ghiblhi (sorry I am a terrible speller!) produced such beautiful, picturesque backgrounds that did not need any changes.\n\nMy main gripe is the new dubs though. The older dubs, the sisters in particular, were perfect. Sweet, innocent, adorable voice. Not whiny or annoying. I am sorry but the Fanning sister were not a good choice. Both of their voices are grating to my ears- a bit too high pitched, nasaly, and like they are forcing an immature tone to sound younger that comes across as unnatural and whiny rather than young and innocent. Also the Fanning sisters' voices sound very similar, so it is kind of confusing since the characters are a good 5 or 6 years apart in age.\n\nAlso Disney changed some of the dialogue. The original version the dialogue was perfect and I suppose Disney tried to take it up a notch, probably to appeal to ""today's audience"" and for whatever reason Disney thinks kids want dumbed down, over simplified language and of course calling each other degrading names and using negative language to get a point across. Ok, ok- it is certainly toned down compared to so many kid's movies on the market, but I preferred the language in the original movie much more, it was subtle yet expressive and there was nothing to raise an eyebrow and you would feel comfortable showing it to even the most impressionable toddler. I have high standards for what I show my children, especially when they are young. All they need to do is see it one time in a movie and they repeat it incessantly- so I wish movies would stick to things we don't mind our kids repeating.\n\nBOTTOM LINE- the original is so much better, and worth hunting it down on eBay or what have you and yes, even paying $25 for (and I am a total tight wad!). This is a beloved classic that your kids (and you) will watch over and over again, so invest in the better Ghibli version. Even if you don't have kids, you will appreciate the subtle genius of Miyazaki's original english dubbed version so much more!";MY FAVORITE MOVIE- BUT BAD DISNEY VERSION
9;20.0;5.0;16.0;"When they talk about the classic Miyazaki that almost everybody likes, this is the one people point to...\nIt's not a controversial film like Princess Mononoke, The Wind Rises, or (to a lesser extent) Howl's Moving Castle are.\nIt's just a sweet little film that's inoffensive and very, very creative.\nThe title character is one of the weirder creatures you'll see on film but is very endearing.  I think many people in Japan probably bought a Totoro plush doll as their first plush doll!  He certainly has become the symbol/mascot of Studio Ghibli just as Spider-Man and Mickey Mouse are the corporate symbols of Marvel Comics and Walt Disney Company respectively.\nI don't see anything offensive in this film and frankly don't understand the problem some people might have with the bathing scene in the movie.  Likewise, the business of the mother being in the TB ward/sanitarium shouldn't really be something that keeps young kids from watching this film.  Honestly, Bambi has more trauma than anything I've seen in this movie!\nIf you have small kids or are going to start a Ghibli film collection, this is definitely the film to get or start with...\n\nP.S. -- I've seen both the Disney and Troma Films/Carl Macek-supervised English dubs of ""My Neighbor Totoro.""  I frankly didn't understand why Disney did a new dub for the film but it's their money at any rate.  The Disney home video release is better simply because the film is in proper aspect ratio and not cropped like the earlier Fox Video release with the original English dub.  The Macek dub is actually one of the better dubs the late producer supervised and it's kind of a shame it's not available in the States on anything but the OOP Fox Video releases (VHS, laserdisc, and DVD).\n\nP.S. P.S. -- The older daughter in the film (on the original Japanese audio track) is voiced by Noriko Hidaka who is best known (in the West) as the original Japanese voice of Akane Tendo in the Ranma 1/2 anime series.  She also voiced the character Noriko in the Gunbuster OVA series.";My perennial Miyazaki favorite...
37;21.0;1.0;23.0;"Ok I LOVE this movie. It has been a favorite of mine for close to 20 years. The problem with this blu-ray set is the Fanning sisters. All of the charm of the sisters in the movie is lost on the voices that just don't match. I mean Mae is like two or three years old. Having a mature kid's voice come out of her mouth is like, ""What the what??"" Even my six-year-old who also loves the original and has it on vhs asked me if this was a different movie. We both lost interest while watching.\n\nSo the one star is ONLY because Disney ruined this movie.  If you can find the original English over Japanese dub, get it and enjoy this sweet movie.";best movie ever RUINED by Disney
4;22.0;5.0;12.0;"BOTTOM LINE: One of the all-time greatest family films ever made. Period. Its easy-going storytelling is so engrossing and captivating that you're left wanting it to go on much longer than it does. Wonderful entertainment for anyone & everyone. A crown jewel for animation fans. Better than ever here in hi-def. Don't wait. Buy yourself a copy today. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is pure motion picture magic.\n\nTHE STORY: In the 1950's, a young husband and his two precocious daughters are relocating to a quiet rural community to get away from the hustle & bustle of big city life. They're still close enough for Dad to commute to his teaching job at a local university, and for the girls to be close to their mother (who's slowly recovering from tuberculosis at a nearby hospital). The wide open countryside is filled all kinds of amazing discoveries for the two city girls: there's a big house that will need lots of TLC to be turned from a house into a home, a new school & new friends to meet. But most amazingly of all... finding that the nearby woods is inhabited by a magical forest spirit, a huge, fuzzy, lovable creature named Totoro.\n\nTHOUGHTS: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is one of those films that doesn't really have a particular plot that's simple or easy to describe. Like so much of the best things in life this film isn't a destination, it's a journey. It's not about what happens so much as how it happens. I first rented this years ago at a video store, not knowing anything about the film. It was my first Miyazaki film, but not my first anime' - so I had some preconceived notions of what to expect. I couldn't have been more wrong, or more delighted. I was spellbound watching the story unfold, enchanted by the incredibly detailed designs of the backgrounds, the absolutely beautiful scenery. It was so richly detailed that it was hard to believe it was hand drawn animation. And the various human characters were so warm and real that I felt like I was watching people I'd known while growing up. The slow-paced nature of TOTORO may be a drag to some, but I think it's one of this film's greatest strengths. It defies traditional anime' expectations in the absolute best possible way. What a wonderful change from the frenzied style of AKIRA, ROBOTECH, and other such action-filled product. They're fine, but TOTORO, in its charming, disarming, summer lazyday way is equally impressive. Young or old, any viewer with a connection to his or her inner child should be totally enthralled watching this wonderful tale unfold. It's definitely my favorite Miyazaki film, my favorite anime' by far, and one of my very favorite animated films of all time, ever. It's right up there the beloved Golden Age classics from Disney or the modern greats from Pixar, and Warner's IRON GIANT.\n\nTHE BLU-RAY: Disney's hi-def release of MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, as with their other Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli product, is a strong one. As clean & crisp as you're likely to get for this film. Detail is impressive and the muted color scheme is well-represented. No artifacting, pixelation, edge enhancement or crush (video noise) that I could detect. Soundmix was even and solid. The dubbing job is top notch as well. Bonus features are well-produced and cover much of the world of Hayao Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli; detailing his life, the history of the studio and the particulars behind the creation of this film. Good stuff. If you have this on DVD it's a marginal recommend for double-dipping. If you don't then by all means buy this Blu-ray/DVD combo - and give the DVD to a friend that doesn't yet have a Blu-ray player.";Rich & enchanting. Magical in every way. A triumph of animation that's just about perfect.
100;23.0;1.0;37.0;I'm afraid I could never recommend the Disney release of this film.\n\nAfter seeing an earlier release before the girls' parts were rendered by the Fanning sisters, my wife and I found _their_ rendering VERY disappointing.\n\nI'm afraid we both believe the characters were not at all captured well and the Fannings' rendering simply ruined Totoro for us.\n\nFortunately, although I had already given away an earlier copy, I was able to find another through Amazon's third party offerings.\n\nIf you can obtain the older version: DO SO!!!;Not a version I could recommend
246;24.0;5.0;46.0;As parents, we've been buying lot of Disney animated movies for our kids (9 and 2 year old). Then one day we saw this cute litle creature on the  cover of this Japanese video cover, I decided to buy it and what an  investment that was. From that momemnt on we fell in love with every single  charecter of the movie, yes, there is no need for a villain in this movie,  no bad guys, and the movie still great, Disney should take note of this.  Totoro came into our family life such as a fresh breeze and gave us a total  new look on kid's movie, more magical than any Disneyesque stuffs we saw in  the past. The story was so original, the rural Japan backgound and the  school scene reminded me Viet Nam of my youth ( yes , Viet Nam, when there  was no fighting nearby). I wept when the kids cried and laughed throghuout  the movie, specially my 2 year old. She must watch it every night before  she can sleep.;not enough stars for this movie
6;25.0;1.0;12.0;"Awwwwwww.... LOVE this movie, HATE this version of it! Almost all of my Miyazaki collection  is getting dated and scratched up, some of my discs are no longer playable (yeah, my really small kids had a field day with them, though).  Since blu ray hit the scene, I decided to order almost all of my old collection in the new blu ray... and didn't read the comments/reviews on them before ordering. Ugh!! big mistake.  I didn't realize the studio has re-released some of these (I haven't played all of them yet so don't know how many are affected)... so far my new Kiki is vastly different, the new version is worse... and my new Totoro (I'm writing this in May of 2016) is VASTLY different and I think horrible.  The story line doesn't change but you cringe just listening to the Fanning sisters trying to enunciate certain words. Totoro is a foreign word, so not technically japanese, but I'm japanese, and speak enough to know what they're supposed to be saying; neither of them roll their ""R"" sounds and don't pronounce it correctly, and their american colloquial inflections can't be disguised. It comes across as westerners just trying too hard to fit into the new oriental cool.  If you are Issei or nissei, you try to shrug it off but inside you are grimacing. I've already ordered another Kiki (hope its the old one, hard to tell on Amazon) and will also order another Totoro (will try to find an older copy, I think the new release date was 2013). Highly recommend you NOT get the new blu ray version, it is NOTHING like the old one.";Don't get the new blu ray!!
86;26.0;1.0;27.0;The original version is streamline.\nIf you are looking for the original version to replace your videotape that's going bad from so much use do not buy this one!!  It will be a huge disappointment to you and your children.\nWe bought this version for quite a bit of money in the new box set from Disney in order to replace our old video tape and felt totally betrayed.  I usually like Dakota Fanning and I feel bad saying it, but the magic is missing from this version.\nThere are definitely issues with the translation in the old version, but the charm and similarity to how actual sisters act is gone.\n\nThis is an amazing movie in both versions, but it does not change the fact that the version my kids grew up watching was what we were looking for.  We had a VHS tape that finally died and I was only looking to replace it.  If I had know about this problem I wold have looked for a used cd instead.\nI am sure any kid who grows up with the newer version will prefer it to the Streamline version, so if you do not have mine or my kids' prejudice you are probably going to love it, and I am sure you will love it as much as my kids and I love the version we are used to.  In fact, I have heard that the reason for the changes have something to do with the Streamline translation having been changed from what Miyazaki had originally approved of.  So maybe it is closer to his vision and better in that way.  And maybe that explains some of the problems with the old translation I mentioned previously.;Not the original English version!!!- and not nearly as good!
219;27.0;1.0;36.0;I agree with the reviewer below. I was holding out on purchasing this film on VHS, wanting it on DVD instead. I was excited when Amazon.com alerted me to this release. I expected it to be the same as the marvelous 2DVD, Region 2 release with full-screen presentation, bi-lingual audio and subtitles and an extra DVD full of special features. I was extremely disappointed in receiving this full-screen, pan-and-scan version with only an English audio voice track! No special features! The folks who released this should be ashamed. Miyazaki deserves better...;Also Very Disappointed
11;28.0;1.0;12.0;"This has the usual 10-15 minutes of advertising preceding every play. You can skip forward after the Disney logo but there is no easy way to get to the main feature. This is a bad practice that Disney should abandon: the disk should start at the menu where you can pick what to watch. This is a movie that will outlast the promotional content and be watched many times. Forcing children to watch ads for Toy Story and Beauty and the Beast is wrong: make them opt-in not opt-out.\n\nI first knew the 20th Century Fox version of this movie and loved it. Sadly the Disney redub falls far short of the quality of the rest of the movie. The saving grace of the deluxe edition is that it has the Japanese soundtrack and you can turn on the English subtitles. I would recommend watching that over the English dubbed version. Interestingly the old version used DVDs sell at a 500%-1000% premium to the new Disney version.\n\nI will blame Disney for the desecration of this masterpiece. Many criticize the actors but ultimately they are following a script and a director paid for by Disney. The subtlety, sensitivity and innocence of the movie are not matched by the performances of this cast. I don't speak Japanese so I cannot judge whether the script is true to the original. However it does not ring true to what you see on screen. Having heard the earlier dub and read the English subtitles I feel those are truer to the story told by the animation.\n\nIt also feels like they were trying too hard to Americanize a Japanese movie. I loved seeing a glimpse of Japanese culture and tradition. It might seem odd or different but to an American it should be.\n\nOh and the Cat Bus - so sad to hear a timid ""meow"" when you are expecting MRAOOOOWRRRR! He's a deity of the forest not a house cat! Just another marker of poor direction: underplaying the outrageous and overplaying everything else.\n\nThe movie itself is 5 stars. The Disney ""value added"" features bring it to 1 star. It's worth getting but go with the Japanese track + English subtitles if you do.";Disney WTF! Desecrating a masterpiece?
20;29.0;1.0;14.0;"Once again, they ruined the original voice track with some new, ""updated"" one, ostensibly thinking that this was a good idea? I love the quality of the print, but I can't bear to watch this thing, so I'm back the the '90's DVD release which is far superior.";Another downer... BIGTIME
15;30.0;4.0;13.0;I love Totoro and all the other movies from Hayao Mi yazaki even after I became an adult. Sadly yes it not the best quality video and the voices aren't the original. I don't know if the quality of the video would of been better if I gotten the blu-ray(may be) But this is the other version that was air in cartoon network and I watched it as a kid, so it's not a complete lost. I seen both versions plus the Japanese voices with English subs and at the end its always an amazing story.\n\nThis great to have in your collection and as a gift to any one  but if you really want the original may be try to find it elsewhere or may be get the Blu-Ray for better quality.;I love Totoro even after childhood.
81;31.0;5.0;22.0;"Hayao Miyazaki, the most prominent Japanese filmmaker who has created animated films that not only broke Japanese box office records but has created animated films that reflect upon nature, technology, family and more.  Compared to the accomplishments of Walt Disney, Miyazaki is a filmmaker who has amassed a respect from his fans worldwide and his animations studio, Studio Ghibli, continues to be one of the most appreciated and respected animation and production studios in the world.\n\nIn 1988, wrote and directed the animated classic ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (Tonari no Totoro) which won the Animage Grand Prix Award in 1988 and was brought over to the United States from Fox Video/Streamline on VHS in the '90s and on DVD in 2002.  When their rights expired, Disney picked up the rights to the many of the Studio Ghibli films and redubbed the film featuring major Hollywood talent and re-released the film on DVD in 2006 but this time with both an English and Japanese audio track.\n\nHere we are in 2010 and with Miyazaki's latest film ""Ponyo"" being released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 2nd, Disney will also re-release Studio Ghibli classics such as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Castle in the Sky"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" special editions on DVD.\n\nVIDEO & AUDIO:\n\n""My Neighbor Totoro"" is just an amazing animated film which I first watched back in 1993 (in Japanese, no subtitles) and at the time, although I didn't know what was going on, I was simply in awe with the animation.  Of how beautiful the artistic backgrounds were.  The village and its lush green, to the painted detail on the trunk of the trees to even the ground during rainy weather, I was impressed. Now, the film is 22-years-old and watching it again, the film still holds up remarkably well today.\n\nThe film is presented in widescreen (1:85:1) - enhanced for 169 televisions.  Colors are vibrant and one can only hope that Disney releases the film via HD on Blu-ray.\n\nAs for the audio, audio is clear and understandable.  The film is presented in English Dolby Digital Sound and also includes the Japanese and French language tracks.  It's important to note that fans of the film have heard two different English dubs of ""My Neighbor Totoro"", the FOX Streamline dub and the current Disney dub.  Both are well-done but the difference is that in the Fox dub, the characters of Mei and even Kanta sound much older.  While in the Disney dub, Kanta sounds a bit more younger.  It's a matter of preference as both English dubs are done very well but its important to note that the Fox/Streamline version is out of print long ago and the DVD never came with the Japanese track or special features.  Nevertheless, for those new to ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I'm sure they will enjoy the voice acting by the Fanning sisters.\n\nSubtitles are in English and French.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n""My Neighbor Totoro"" comes with the following special features on a second DVD disc.  Included are:\n\n  * Original Japanese Storyboards - (1:26:16) - Watch the entire film but this time with the video showcasing the original storyboards.\n  * Creating My Neighbor Totoro - (2:59) Hayao Miyazaki talks about how he came up with the concept of ""My Neighbor Totoro"".\n  * Creating the Characters - (4:22) Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about the characters of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and how ""E.T. was an influence.\n  * The Totoro Experiencing - (2:00) Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how the film didn't do well in the box office but when it aired on television, it did remarkably well.\n  * Producer's Perspective: Creating Ghibli - (1:22) Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how the named ""Ghibli"" came about.\n  * The Locations of Totoro - (28:34) An excerpt from a Japanese documentary on ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and visiting the areas that inspired Miyazaki to create the village of Totoro.\n  * Scoring Miyazaki - (7:17) A featurette about Joe Hisaishi's scoring Miyazaki films and more.\n  * Original Japanese Trailer - (1:50) The original Japanese theatrical trailer.\n  * Behind the Microphone - (5:41) Featuring the English dub voice talents talking about their role, their appreciation for Miyazaki and his films.  Also, behind-the-scenes of the talent recording their voices.\n  * Ponyo - Creating Ponyo - (3:56) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the creation of ""Ponyo"" and wanting to create a film for young children.\n  * Kiki's Delivery Service - Creating Kiki's Delivery Service -  (2:27) Hayao Miyazaki discussing the creation of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and what inspired Miyazaki for the creation of the city in the film.\n  * Castle in the Sky: Character Sketches - (2:37) Miyazaki talks about the characters of ""Castle in the Sky"" and discussing how his audiences are loyal to his films over time.\n  * Enter the Lands - Visit the land featuring various small animated Studio Ghibli characters (from all films).  Click on a character from that film (note: only ""Ponyo"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky"" are available) to get a Q&A or a small video info. of that film and its characters.\n\nEXTRAS:\n\nAlso, included is a postcard featuring Satsuki and Totoro at the bus stop.\n\nJUDGMENT CALL:\n\nI absolutely love ""My Neighbor Totoro"".  From when I first saw it in Japanese (which I didn't understand at the time) at a Japanese animation club screening back in 1993 and now watching it over 15-years-later and watching it alongside with my son.  There is this captivating quality with Miyazaki's characters, his enjoyable to sometimes serious screenplays and Studio Ghibli always delivering when it comes to quality.\n\nAnd when you consider how a lot of animated films today are 100% CG animated, when you see a Miyazaki film, you know that he doesn't follow the mainstream.  He makes the kind of films that he wants and for the most part, every film that I have seen from Studio Ghibli, I've been more than satisfied.\n\nI remember watching ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and enjoying the lively moments from the beginning but having seen his animated films ""Nausicaa"", ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" and even ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", as his films are happy and humorous, by the final half of the film, the story definitely shifts to a serious tone and in this film, it does get a bit serious when both Satsuki and Mei facing the probability of their mother dying in the hospital.  These are genuine emotions that these two young girls feel but at the same time, what transpires afterward was captivating and how the film ends, Miyazaki definitely knows how to wrap up a film and make you feel content and satisfied with overall story.\n\n""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a wonderful family film and by no means is it scary.  For the parents, this film is among the more lighter-toned Miyazaki films out there.  Miyazaki has mentioned in interviews that he created ""My Neighbor Totoro"" for the children while his latest film ""Ponyo"" was more of him wanting to create a film for even younger children.  But for the most part, if you want to introduce a Miyazaki film to your children, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a great place to start.\n\nBut the big question for many people is if ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is worth the investment, especially if you own the 2002 and 2006 DVD releases.  If you own the 2006 Disney DVD, there are a large number of special features on this 2010 release that are not included in the 2006 DVD but if you are not into special features, then its probably not worth buying it again.  But for those who have never owned the DVD, let alone only have that old Fox/Streamline VHS or DVD, then yes its definitely worth it!  I know there are some fans who prefer the original dub from the old Fox/Streamline years but that release was pretty much barebones.  Yes, I still have my old copy of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and I did enjoy the original dub a lot but personally, with this newer release, you get the Japanese audio track and plenty of special features that were not included in the 2006 DVD release as well.\n\nOverall, this 2010 ""My Neighbor Totoro"" DVD release is fantastic.  A great film with a lot of new bonus content.  Highly recommended!";2010 DVD Release:  A magnificent Hayao Miyazaki film with gorgeous animation and painted backgrounds and an enjoyable film for t

Many of the phrases are different and the dialogue is off. If you have seen the original DO NOT PURCHASE this. The movie quality is there and it looks wonderful, but again if you love the original movie you will notice within the first 2 minutes that this is not the same. I have the original as well and there were too many discrepancies for me to actually enjoy this purchase.;Disappointed
44;33.0;1.0;16.0;"I'm actually disappointed with new blu ray release. I all honesty I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes before I had to turn it off. All of the original cast members from the 2005 English version are gone. I'm very disappointed that they replaced the voices with Tim Daly, Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, and Pat Carroll in this new Disney version from 2006+. The dialogue changed too. I'm quite disappointed with the change. The voices in the blu ray version lacks emotions and meaning. It's so bad that I am looking to buy the old DVD.\n\nSo here's the deal for those of you who have not noticed or are unaware of the change. The original version that came out produced by Troma Films and 20th Century Fox (I believe) was much more entertaining translation. To put it lightly, there were quite a few elements that was ""lost in translation"" when the Disney version came out. For example, those black soot things with the eyes were referred in the Fox version as ""dust bunnies,"" while in the Disney version they are referred to as ""dust gremlins.""\n\nAs much as I love Tim Daly as an actor, I could not stand him in this movie. It's pronounced TOE TOE ROW not TOE ROW ROW, for god sake pronounce it correctly. The original Fox version starred Greg Snegoff, Alexandra Kenworthy, Lisa Michelson, Cheryl Chase, Natalie Core, and Kenneth Hartman. If you're looking for the film, be sure to find the version prior to 2006 that was produced by Fox otherwise you'll be gravely disappointed as I was.";What happened to the original cast from the 2005 release?!?

I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone.  However, if you want to experience this movie as it was intended to be seen, please wait for a better DVD release.  This DVD, by Fox, is missing the Japanese language track (in order to watch it subtitled), and it is full-screen only, meaning the image has been cropped.  Disney is set to re-release this movie, perhaps in 2005, so do yourself a favor and wait until then.  In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with renting this version of Totoro!;"Great movie; but don't buy it (yet)!"

But when I went to find it on DVD I was appalled to find it only in pan-and-scan(!)\nI'm shaking my head that the studio feels they need to dumb down the format to appeal to preschoolers and their babysitters. I can hear the Totoro crying as I write...\nSo what did I do? I went to Ebay and found the all-region Japanese pressing, in letterbox, with both English and Japanese audio. Don't encourage the studios by buying their full-screen monstrosities (sorry Amazon).;Stunning film but poor mastering............
205;38.0;2.0;24.0;I couldn't wait for My Neighbor Totoro to be released on DVD. When I finally received the DVD, what a disappointment. Its full screen (pan&scan) and the audio is sub par. Fox rushed this out only to capitalize off of Spirited Away's success. Its basically the Videotape edition transfered to disc. Anyone who appreciates the advantages of viewing DVDs and the artistic genius of Miyazaki will be greatly let down. Disney has done a beautiful job on Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky. I only hope Fox will rerelease a better edition of this masterpiece.;Animee masterpiece...Terrible DVD, buy the video.

I haven't seen the movie in years, but immedately i knew there was something wrong. My neighbor totoro IS a great movie, in the original english voice over and if you want to watch it in japanese. This version was redubbed by Disney and much of the dialog has been changed and all the magic is Gone. The original voices actually sound like voice acting with real emotion. The characters all sound like their literally reading everything off of a prompter with zero emotion or feeling which ruins it I think anyone could have done better voice acting, Honestly its like watching a totally different movie, its a night and day difference. Even totoros voice is different. The last time i saw this movie it aired on cartoon network and was heart moving. I'm sad Disney ruined such a great film.\n\nMoral of the story is they NEED to add another voice option of the original voice acting. Words cannot describe how watching this new version has totally destroyed such a great childhood memory. It makes me sick.;Great movie, HORRIBLE VERSION, DO NOT BUY!!!

Those who have seen the original and love it, don't even bother buying the dvd because the voices suck and the script has even been changed alot. The only good thing i have to say is that Miyazaki is awesome and the graphics are great, newcomers to Totoro who have not seen the original by all means try this new one out, but those that have seen the original don't waste your money buying this becuase it is not worth it.;The original is better - the new dub sucks!

Not only are the kids voices and Totoro's voice changed, but Disney also edited the dialouge UGGGHHH ... once you see the fox 2002 version, you'll never be able to watch the disney version again I assure you ...;Disney Hacked the Voices
29;43.0;5.0;10.0;Okay, to clear up the confusion of the mixed reviews I see on Totoro, I will share my research.\nThe older version is the one we all remember. The cover has Totoro flying (on the pink spinning top) over a path with a bright red umbrella in his hand, and Satsuki (wearing yellow pajamas) on his belly. Mei (wearing a red dress and a yellow hat) is running on the path below after the blue and the white little Totoros. Amazon states that the actors are all japanese (Hitoshi Takagi (Actor), Noriko Hidaka (Actor), Hayao Miyazaki (Director, Writer) ,but this movie is dubbed by the original voicecast, (Lisa Michaelson, Cheryl Chase, Steve Kramer, Alexandra Kenworthy, Kenneth Hartman, Natalie Core, Rob Paulson, Frank Welker). Notice I did not mention the Fanning girls, Tim Daly, or Pat Carroll. They are in the new Disney version. I mistakenly got the Disney version initially. Don't make the same mistake as me. The original Fox movie with all its charm will have the DVD case I described, the others are the Disney versions (side note: if it is important to you to watch Totoro in the Japanese language, the Disney ones are the only ones that have that feature). Having been raised on the Fox version, I was so upset when I started watching the new one. Not only have the voices changed, but the entire script is full of changes. The pace is faster and way less magical. The beginning song is harsh. Overall, the vibe was way off. I am so sad they changed it. Get the Fox version while you still can, even though it is more expensive. I paid about 60 dollars for the old version (even after I couldn't return the new horrible version), and I don't regret it. God I love this movie!;Confused? The Original (5 stars) vs The New Version (0 stars)
243;44.0;5.0;24.0;"Japanese animated feature about two young girls who meet a supernatural creature, or spirit, named ""Totoro.""  Director Miyazaki's talents shine in this movie with beautiful animation and simple pleasures.  The  story is set in the late 1950's when a college professor moves to the  country with his two daughters who are approximately five and eight years  of age.  The family is happy for the most part, but their mother is  confined to a hospital for an illness not identified in the story.  The  girls are enchanted with their new home, an old spacious house situated in  the country, surrounded by farms and forests.  Unusual events begin to take  place with mysterious little creatures running around the house and strange  winds and noises outside the house at night.  Eventually the girls discover  Totoro, a large mythical creature who looks like a cross between a bear and  rabbit; he's big!  Mei, the youngest of the two girls, meets him first and  she's the one who names him ""Totoro."" Satsuki, the older sister,  meets Totoro later in the film while waiting for her father at a lonely  bus-stop during an evening rainstorm, which is probably the most enjoyable  scene in the movie.  With Totoro are his two little brothers, miniature  versions of himself, and a giant cat who looks like a bus.  Totoro and the  giant Catbus come to the rescue when Mei is lost in the country after  running off in anguish to look for her mother at the hospital, and Satsuki  is in dispair trying to find her sister.  The story is simple and it's enchanting.";Very Nice Story and Beautiful Animation
197;45.0;1.0;21.0;Unfortunately, this DVD is a poor-quality pan-and-scan release.  Needs to be indicated on the product description.;Great Film, HORRIBLE DVD
5;46.0;1.0;6.0;Not the original! My children (now mid 20s) were so disappointed that they couldn't get past the first 20 minutes. :(;Not the Original!!!
50;47.0;3.0;11.0;I'd like to start by saying I have nothing but the utmost respect for Studio Ghibli, and for My Neighbor Totoro as a children's film. That said, I absolutely loathe Disney's English dub of this film.\n\nDisney's blu-ray release of this film was highly anticipated, and rightly so, it's a beautful charming film, that doesn't seem to rely on the adult supposition of what a life is like for a child, and, unlike Disney, doesn't create a perilous environment of evil-doers as a way to ratchet up tension. In many ways it's a slyly lazy little film of childhood innocence and exploration as a means of coping with the more adult problems of change and fear. The usual Ghibli subtext of the magic of nature is present too.\n\nWhere Disney's release falls flat though is the tragic dubbing. Most of the voice work on this release is done by regular actors not actors devoted to the craft of voicework, and it shows. The film is poorly synced with the dialogue, and the acting, especially by the child actors is awful and disrupts the flow of the film entirely. It would be one thing if there wasn't already a better English version on the market (though currently out-of-print) from Fox/Streamline. The Fox version features exceptional voicework by industry voice actors who are familiar with the intricacies of Japanese anime, whereas Disney opted for redubbing the entire film with the likes of Dakota and Elle Fanning, and Frank Welker (who voices animals for Disney and others for a living but just ruins Totoro with excess in my opinion). It's a tragic mistake that would almost be forgivable if Disney would just pony up the cash and buy the recording from Fox and allow it as an option for those of us that prefer it, as was rumored with the Blu-ray release. The problem is that the Fox version was released prior to Disney's contract with Ghibli, and perhaps Disney would rather pay their own actors rather than entertain the idea that someone else's version might be superior, or perhaps it was just cheaper to do so. It's sad because the Disney version just feels empty and the audio mix sounds too clean and airy, whereas if you switch to the Japanese language mix you can see how it was meant to be done. The kids voices, for example, blend neatly with the ambient sounds of insect, weather, and traffic, whereas Disney relegates humans to the extreme forefront, and everything else is left behind.\n\nThe good news is, you can't go wrong with this film. It's beautifully animated, intelligent and well-crafted, and you won't find a story more suitable for children in any of Disney's oeuvre, but you could spend your money on one of the few remaining copies of the out-of-print Fox version, instead of supporting Disney's lousy choice. Or, you could buy the Disney version and listen to the Japanese audio with subtitles for a truly authentic experience.\n\nPS Disney pulled the same stunt with their release of Ghibli's Kiki's Delivery Service. What a tragic horrible misdeed. Using Phil Hartman as a cat -- ugh. Unfortunately, Streamline didn't release this film on DVD, only VHS, so we're stuck with it until Disney comes to their senses. Maybe someone with clout will start a letter-writing campaign?;Totoro, great film, lousy audio options on this release, even on Blu-Ray.
167;48.0;1.0;18.0;Totoro is a treasured part of our Miyazaki collection.  On VHS.\n\nI saw the premiere of this dvd version on TCM recently, and was appalled at the quality of the dubbed voices.  In every respect, the dub on the Fox VHS version of several years ago is preferable.  For those who are familiar with the earlier version, this new one is uncomfortable to watch.  To newcomers the choice may be easier, but my 5 year old daughter made me change the channel.;Disney Flubs the Dub
174;49.0;5.0;18.0;"Forget the old FOX VIDEO DVD release (cropped & dubbed) look for this new Disney DVD release in 1.85:1 (16:9 enhanced widescreen.\nOriginal Japanese audio & new English dub, storyboards, behind-the-scenes.\n\nThis is the original edit as dictated by Ghibli Studios, not a re-edit. It has the original Japanese language tracks. Some mistake the 1980's english version as the original, it is not.\n\nThe old version is actually the RE-EDIT created by 20th Century Fox for U.S. theatrical release. At the time Studio Ghibli was eager to get their films shown in the U.S. and did not retain creative control. They really regretted this and wish to believe these U.S. edits never existed (the U.S. edit of Nausicaa was the worst).\n\nNow that their films are popular in the U.S. they are exercising their creative control and forbid Disney from altering the films. Disney was in charge of re-dubbing the English translations with Studio Ghibli's approval of the translation. The pronunciation of the names is closer to the original Japanese pronunciation.\n\nIt is doubtful that you will ever hear the old 20th Century FOX translation again on DVD/Blu-ray. 20th Century FOX no longer holds the U.S. rights to Totoro.\n\nThe cover doesn't mention any edits because it is NOT edited, the old 20th Century FOX version is the edited version that should have been labeled as such.\n\nBLU-RAY update 5/30/13:\nIf you are going to upgrade to the new Blu-ray consider how big your TV is.  If your HD-TV is not over 40"" you will not see much of an upgrade.  Studio Ghibli dictated that Disney not tamper with the film to 'enhance' it for Blu-ray.  You will get the original image on the Blu-ray, but Disney's 2006 DVD was so good there will not be much of an improvement.";Blu-ray not much of an upgrade from the DVD.

28;50.0;1.0;9.0;"The movie itself is a 5 star film. Gorgeous animation. Simple story. Great for kids and adults. But the Disney rerelease featuring the Fanning's destroys a lot of the charm of the original. I bought the updated version maybe six months ago and we just never watched it. When we finally put it on my daughter noticed the change immediately. She hated the new voices and even the slight changes in the script (Mei saying ""She's so mean"" instead of ""I'm not stupid"" etc.). It was distracting and just ""off"". The original dub track was so perfect it didn't even feel like a dub track. I'm sad that Disney (who I've been impressed with on other rereleases) has mangled a classic so horribly. There is no updated voice that I prefer in any way over the original.\n\nNow I'll have to head over to Half-Priced Books to try to find the old DVD copy that I sold back.";The movie is a masterpiece, this rerelease is not
41;51.0;1.0;10.0;I really wish I had read the comments before I bought this. Let me start off by saying this has been one of my all time favorite movies since I was a small child. I already have this movie on a really old VHS tape, so I wanted to buy the film on DVD. Well, turns out they re-did it for Disney. It's not the same! I just opened it to watch it, and the dialogue and characters are totally different. I'm sure it would be fine if I had never seen the other version, but I have, and it holds some sentimental value to me, so I was highly disappointed.;READ BEFORE YOU PURCHASE
148;52.0;2.0;17.0;"My daughter and I have been watching My Neighbor Totoro for years. We loved it, and even though we've seen it about a million times I have yet to feel like I have watched it too much. I love just about everything Studio Ghibli has put out. I am very happy that I have the old Fox version. It will continue to be the version watched in my home since it has the dignity that I believe the original My Neighbor Totoro has. Put more bluntly, you'll get the Fox version from my cold dead hands.\n\nThis Disney dub is very disappointing.\n\nThe first thing that I've noticed is how much of the reverence for nature has been stripped out. It's lost most of the magical beauty that was in it. The Fox version may not be as visually stunning, but the translation is so much better, as is the voice acting. This dub took me back to the bad old days of dubs when the lip movement did not even come close to the voice over. It's also been very Americanized. One example would be when Mei finds the bottomless bucket and calls it ""stupid"", as if it were now useless. In the Fox version she simply says ""It has no bottom!"" in wonder. Children can find so many different uses for things most adults can not. It's part of the wonder of childhood, and that wonder is normally very well expressed in Studio Ghibli films. In hearing the translation differences between the Fox version and the Disney version I wonder how badly mangled other Disney dubbed versions of Ghibli movies are.\n\nMy daughter pointed out each and every time when something was different. In our family we have used the illustration of when Satsuki calls Mei ""stupid"" for why we never should call people stupid. In the Disney version, that lesson is totally gone. The Disney version also dumbs down the English vocabulary. In the Fox version the word ""pollywogs"" is used rather than ""tadpoles"" in the water. It's an old term for tadpoles and I was just plain ecstatic about the ""big words"". I love in Kiki's Delivery Service that the word ""dirigible"" was used rather than ""blimp"". Neither of these words are too hard for children to learn or say. My daughter was two when we first viewed each of those films and saying both words and knew what they meant! If you asked her if she wanted to see a tadpole she'd look at you blankly, but ask her if she wanted to see a pollywog she would light up!\n\nThe ""special features"" on the Disney DVD don't make up the cost of this film. The features amount to one whole DVD with the original story boards set to the *new* dubbing, a ""behind the scenes"" of the recording of the Disney dubbing, and an un-restored trailer for the movie. Oh, there are ads too. I do so love to buy ads.";Pretty is as pretty does
63;53.0;1.0;12.0;First off I want to say I do not hate Totoro, I hate what disney has done wit it. Now if you are looking for a wonderful story about a loving family who are separated by unfortunate circumstances and then reunited in the end, then this is not the DVD for you. Yes it is still the same basic story line, and yes it is still the same basic animation. However disney has ruined it with their new voice actors and remastering. If you truly love the work of Miyazaki then find yourself the original VHS version of this film and buy that. Dakota Fanning and her little sister need to stay away from anime and the classic works of a great artist and writer. As for that disney needs to stay away from anime, they already destroy every day animation leave a beautiful work of art alone, I mean have you seen the recent releases from disney? My six month old nephew can draw better than that and come up with a more compelling story line. Totoro is a wonderful story about a family separated by their mothers sickness and the wonder of childhood, it is a beautiful, timeless story. I grew up with the works of Miyazaki, I came to love anime because of Totoro, Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Miyazakis other works. My little sister bought this from costco and when she brought it home we were expecting it to be the story we had come to love so much when we were children. But that's not what we received, this is an atrocity an absolute atrocity that disney is aloud to do this. If you truly love anime and love Miyazaki and his works then please do not buy this, make sure you check the actors check the case get as much information as you can before you buy. You do not want to have your heart broken like me and my little sister did. we are desperately searching for the original we have on VHS and I urge anyone who has the original to hold onto it and cherish it like it deserves to be cherished.;Please read before you buy

I've never heard the prior English dub so I will not comment on it, but if you don't like the english dub, then switch over to the Japanese with the subtitles.

Let me explain there was a previoulsy released edition that was put out by Fox which is the best. The english dubbing on the Disney version is horrific.

Apparently, like the fable goes, once they had it they didn't want it anymore and sold it to Fox to do with what they would.\nWhat they have done, and this won't be news if you've read some of the other reviews here, is to release a very inexpensive product, but you get what you pay for.\nSpecifically, pan and scan instead of widescreen and English dub only.\nIf you are looking for a nice movie for children, and you are not familiar with Miyazaki's work, this version should be OK.\nTo most adults my advice is to get yourself to your nearest search engine and find yourself a widescreen version with a Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.;good movie, bad DVD

Di$ney a cra$$ corporation looking to make some buck$? No! Never. Say it ain't so!\n\nI give this 2 stars simply because it is Miyazaki, and his films in the Western world should be preserved on DVD, even with poor dubbing and pitiful extras.  The one good thing about it is that it's widescreen and in the extras; the storyboards. But the really laughable feature is a behind the scenes of American actors who can't dub to the animation which is awful to say the least.\n\nThough it is not widescreen, I suggest that if you are looking for a nice DVD version with a DELIGHTFUL English dub, hunt down the out of print FOX DVD. A good English dub of Japanese anime is absolutely RARE and this is one of the few shining examples of a perfect dub.\n\nAs for interpritations of ""Susuwatari"" within the story, I can't bear the idea of the girls yelling ""soot gremlins"".  ""Dust bunnies"" is waaaay cuter and fits much better within the confines of the story.

Disney completely ruined the movie by doing this. The sisters sound exactly the same (the idiots chose twins to revoice-over the movie) and the father sounds plain. In fact, most of the voices sound as though they threw together a bunch of random people with no experience, handed them scripts, and told them to voice their parts without any practice.

The original in Japanese, without subtitles, the Fox version, and the Disney version. I would recommend viewers to just get the film, it's well worth the watch. I bought the first DVD in Japanese some years back when my daughters were very young. Both of them have been enrolled in a Japanese Immersion Program at their language school since they were 5-years-old. They speak, read and write Japanese.\n\nI bought the second for my wife and I, [Fox version] and thought it was great. Also, I bought the Disney version when my young nieces and nephews visited their cousins; since they cannot understand Japanese, they are able to listen to this version. I too am a purist; and believe that the inflections of Japanese; or any language in a foreign film should be the primary language listened to with subtitles. However, I also think that one can capture young children's attention--who would otherwise stray, if they were reading subtitles. I know this from experience as a father of two young Japanese-speaking American children.\n\nTherefore, while the spotlight reviewer skewers this DVD, I would recommend the film to those who are not sure if they would like to purchase the film. All one has to do is check my film listings, and you will see that I love Japanese cinema, and have since I was a child in the early to mid 1960s. I went to many Japanese films as a kid [Zatoichi] and saw Mizoguchi's, Kurosawa's and Ozu's films, to name just a few film directors that I grew up watching. The film is worth the purchase: Disney or not. There are plenty of reviews of this film describing this magical cinematic treat, and you and your children will definitely enjoy the film. This film is highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]";A Great Cinematic Treat For Children And Adults!
207;75.0;4.0;15.0;I can't add anything to the other reviews here about the movie itself.  Yes, it's really that good.  Possibly even better.  As the old saying goes: if you have a child, are a child, or ever were a child, you need to see this.\nI can, unfortunatly, say a few less than positive things about the DVD that Fox/FHE has put together here, and I have to dock a star here, and considered docking more.  It's excusable that this is a no-extras release: it's bargain-priced, and I'm sure that the age of the film and the language barrier would make assembling a supplements package difficult.  It is NOT excusable that the film is presented ONLY in pan-and-scan format, with ONLY the (admittedly good) English-language soundtrack.  This film is a work of art, and the only (legal) way to see it right now in the US is in a form that's been vandalized, and that's a pity.\nThat said...buy it anyway.  Your kids won't notice the difference, and hopefully if this disc sells well someone at Fox will notice and put together a proper edition for the enthusiasts.;Brilliant movie, sub-par DVD.
18;76.0;1.0;6.0;Disney ruined this movie. They leave out parts they couldn't get the American actors to say. Its annoying and seriously makes it a different movie.;Disney messed up.
49;77.0;1.0;8.0;This English version of My Neighbor Totoro does not have the original actors!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!

We are returning it RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!;Boooo!!!!! (Has spoilers)
143;78.0;3.0;13.0;"Six stars for Totoro, zero stars for Disney's hachet job on a beutiful movie averages to three stars in my book.\n\nIf you're a Miyazaki vet reconnecting with Setsuki, Mei, the dust bunnies and Catbus, this is *not* the version you're looking for.  Search elsewhere on Amazon for the version distributed by Fox.  Disney has re-voiced this instant classic with Dakota Fanning and Pat Carroll.  No offense to their acting abilities, but Disney's tried to crank out a Mona Lisa using paint-by-numbers and have largely succeeded.\n\nIf you're new to Totoro, my advice holds.  To call this an instant classic sell it short on so many levels.  The webslog family is four in number, with our kids largely corresponding in age to Setsuki and Mei. This movie has become a part of our family's unspoken list of ""Media that we want our kids and their kids and so on to experience"" right up there with Richard Scarrey, Bugs Bunny and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.\n\nThe Fox version (even with voiceovers) put me in rural Japan so firmly and completely that I wish I lived there.  The illustration, landscapes, etc. are lush to a fault, and the VO actors selected in the Fox version fit the age and innocence of the children to a T.\n\nFWIW, the lit crit geek in me guesses that we're in post-Nagasaki Marshall-plan Japan; Mom's in the hospital for radiation poisoning, and I'm not altogether sure she'll make it out of the hospital, making the entire story that much more poignant.";Caveat emptor - Disney's made a mess of this classic.

Well, you make dislike dubbing, but my only comment is that the ""new"" dialogue in the Disney dub is pretty awful.  the ""original"" dub is much funnier, more clever, better word play.  Example-- original  ""Don't forget to say good-bye!"" as tatsuki rushes off to school.  Disney ""Have a nice day!""\n\nEverybody pronounces Totoro in the worst American English  Totorrro, versus the more sing-songy to-to-ro befitting a Japanese creature.";Disney dubbed dialogue subpar
36;81.0;1.0;7.0;So this is what happened and why this one sucks, fox family was a company who had released this movie into the USA in 1990s and had a perfect voice over for each character. Unfortunate they sold their rights to ABC family and thus there are no more remakes of this.\n\nThere is a law that forbids movies to be released again until 4 years have passed with the same titles. So Disney thought it be cute to have Dakota fanning and her sister dub this movie again....boy where they wrong..it sounds horrible compared to Fox Family's version (I own two of the fox family copies because one is unopen and the other is for enjoyment)\n\nAnother thing that pisses me off is the movie cover is a mesh of satsuki and mei instead of satsuki carrying mei on her back. It's frustrating that they let such a big and obvious mistake go.;So the orginal american release verse Disney
208;82.0;2.0;14.0;My Neighbor Totoro is one of the greatest animated films ever produced (for children or otherwise). It is a film that devoted fans such as myself love sharing with children and friends (I even teach it in my Children's Literature class.)\n----The delicacy of Hayao Miyazaki's tale of two young girls who must cope with the stresses of moving to a new house, neighborhood and school--while their mother is kept in a hospital for a problem they do not understand!--is extraordinarily well-told through delightful and surprising events and beautiful animation. That the girls need the friendship and support of their father, the neighbors and the Totoros (friendly nature spirits) is subtly presented and then heroically answered through Miyazaki's unforgettable imagery.\n---But you'll have to trust me on that because a good portion of that imagery has been butchered away through the pan-and-scan process. Not only have the producers of this DVD version cut away much of the visuals but they have also left off the Japanese language track and given us a rather pale transfer.\n----English speaking kids deserve to see this better-than-Disney film. They deserve to view the widescreen version and they deserve the option of hearing the dubbed version (if they cannot yet read) OR hearing it in it's original language while reading subtitles. A quality production would offer these things and more.\n----This DVD offers a Masterpiece, but a badly Mistreated one----;Fantastic Animation -- Unforgivable Treatment

They love how the children interact, and love to see Totoro in all of his glory.\n\nMy husband and I liked it from the first viewing; however as we watched it again and again, we found ourselves stopping whatever we were doing, sitting down and watching it with our kids. And each time we found something intriguing, endearing or something that we had not noticed yet.\n\nI have found that with two loud children, I use subtitles a lot in order to get the gist of the movie. In doing so, I have come across 3 different English subtitles on this movie, and each will give you a different meaning. My husband and I have enjoyed the English subtitles that belong to the Japanese audio immensely, as you get a better idea of what the original intentions were of the film maker (So we use the English Audio with subtitle track 3).\n\nAs for the voice overs, we have not had an issue with it, as we have not heard the previous English version. I have listened to the Japanese audio, and it's enough.\n\nMost important about this movie is the story. Don't let the nay-sayers sway you. This is a wonderful family movie. There is one scene that freaked us out a bit the first time, which is the bath scene. It has a bit of nudity, but it's harmless. We were just your typical uptight American parents!\n\n:D\n\nI hope you enjoy this movie as much as we did.";We kept this movie from Netflix for 2 months before buying!
94;86.0;1.0;11.0;Our video version finally snapped. We bought the Disney version -- BIG mistake!! Disney animators sticker sketched in cheap clutter, I guess to americanize-dumb-down the film. What is totally criminal was their background sounds and trashed soundtrack. The voices are whining, too loud, and the timing is off. Yes it gets worse! the voices are 'read' not acted or matched to the film. They are one, always too loud, tone. No depth, no silence. When I watched it all I could think of was the cheapest american animation at its worse!\n\nThe Fox version is 5 stars, but Amazon displays the same reviews on both versions and most of the versions do not specify if the review is Fox or Disney. If you cannot find the original Fox version borrow it from your local library, from a friend, or wait. Do not get the Disney version!;do NOT buy the Disney version!
149;87.0;1.0;12.0;I am so grossed out by the voiceovers on this new version that I wanted to return it to the video store before I had listened to five minutes of it. I love the intro song on the fox version and have sung it to my children for years. I was shocked to hear the new gruffness in all of the voices in the entire video. I will never purchase Disney's version with the new voice-overs, preferring to stick to the good fox version instead.;Hackjob, didn't even deserve one star.

I also made the mistake of buying this without checking out the reviews. This is not the original version of the film. It's dubbed (no original audio) and equally bad, it's been violated with the completely unnecessary pan and scan. Come on, America, even on my 9-inch TV, I'd rather see a film in its original aspect ratio. This goes into my white elephant heap.;Buyer beware
74;91.0;1.0;9.0;I bought this dvd thinking it was the same as the one my daughter watched 1000 times over on vhs.  It wasn't.

However, aside from a really nice new package, they unfortunately slaughtered it. The ""English"" translation from the original '80's version is the one you want, but good luck finding a copy on DVD. The ""new"" voices used by Disney are much inferior to the English-speaking voices used in the original translation. As usual, Disney took over the rights of this masterpiece for financial gain.

The visualizations are energetic and fun, and the silly voices of the girls and the funny things they say, make my daughter laugh out loud.

32;96.0;1.0;6.0;My kids fell in love with the original Totoro and I had no idea that it would be completely different. New voices, calling things by different names, etc. This completely ruined it for the kids. I hope I can find an original copy. What a bummer. I definitely should have paid a little more attention to dates and names and I would have known something was up. Don't waste your money. :(;Not as expected
127;97.0;1.0;11.0;I was very displeased with the newest version of Totoro. With Dakota and Elle Fannings voices, as well as all the other new voices, made the movie sound horrible and very unlike the original version of Totoro! The newest version could never be compared to the original version! The original version of Totoro should have never been fixed and it will ALWAYS be better than the newest version! I couldn't even get through the first disc, without hearing the new annoying voice sound tracts! VERY DISSAPOINTING! What a waste of money...;New Voice and Sound Tracks!
53;98.0;1.0;7.0;This redubbed is horrible... It's just not the same... They even renamed the characters which is ridiculous!! I had to go to a Tokyo store in the mall and buy it from there so we could have the original dubbed.;Bring back the original dub
33;99.0;3.0;6.0;This was my all time favorite movie when I was a child. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD and I bought it right away. But I was so very disappointed when I watched it. The voices were different, they had recorded over the original dialogue and even changed some of the words. In one scene in the beginning the youngest girl found a little pond with tadpoles in it and she called them tadpoles, but in the original movie the little girl called them golleywolleypogs. Inwardly I couldn't help but reject this movie because the voices were just wrong and so was the dialogue. It made me very sad I couldn't enjoy it  like I did before. I know that may seem petty but I can't help it, I've watched the DVD several times hoping I could get used to it but I can't. But I'll give it a 3 because I absolutely love the story and I always will.;It's a good movie if you never saw it on VHS
93;100.0;1.0;10.0;What a disappointment this DVD was when I shoved itin my player. The facade of this movie was a favourite from my childhood, but what a rude awakening I received. They may have remastered the animation, but they also had the gall to redo the voices which was an absolutely horrific choice. Not only was it a major disappointment because it's not what I expected to hear, but I felt the voices failed to capture the intent of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki or connect to the characters themselves in their American ways. Do not be fooled by the cover and think this is the original. It's not. That was my mistake. Don't let it be yours.;The unfortunate and unexpected
229;101.0;5.0;13.0;"There is a moment in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" that demonstrates what sets it apart from so many so-called family films. Four year old Mei has wandered into the giant tree chasing two little creatures called Totoros. She falls into a pit and lands near a giant sleeping totoro. Eventually she falls asleep. When her big sister Satsuki returns home she and their father discover her. Mei tells them about the totoro.\n\nA lesser children's film would have the father believe she was making it up, and the two children would soon not trust their father and go to great lengths to keep the creature a secret. But the father in ""My Neighbor Totoro"" believes his children are telling the truth. He believes it so much that he thanks the spirits for watching after Mei. The father can be a little absent minded, but he has such a good heart and is a kind person who loves his two daughters. When was the last time a family entertainment was about two sisters instead of two brothers, or a brother and sister?\n\nThat is one of the magics of ""My Neighbor Totoro"". It demonstrates that family films don't have to be about children whose parents die in the first scene, or have evil villains, comical sidekicks, or even songs. (Only two songs occur at the beginning and end. One of them has nothing to do with the story.) It also has a character (a boy next door) that made me laugh not because he was acting funny, but because he behaved in the exact way that boys his age acted around girls.\n\nWhen I wasn't laughing at some of this film, I had a very big grin on my face. I was caught up in this family, as well as the neighbors. The totoro's completely won me over. The giant one was like a big fat cat when it sleeps.\n\nI would like to mention another scene. The father and his two girls enjoy a bath together. This was a scene I feared would cause some concern with parents I recommended the movie to at Hollywood Video. I had a response to them: In Japan it is traditional for families to enjoy evening baths together, although they take a quick shower before entering the bathtub together. It is considered impolite otherwise. The scene is interesting and something that would be very unlikely to be shown in any American film, let alone a family entertainment. Disney certainly wouldn't include such a scene. I believe it is a scene that parents could discuss with their children involving the differences between American and Japanese cultures. But in all my years at Hollywood Video not one parent ever came back showing such concern.\n\nI would like to finish by indicating that the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurowsawa called ""My Neighbor Totoro"" one of the best films he had ever scene. To have such an honor given by someone who was considered at that time to be the greatest living director says a lot for any film. But for an animated film, it's truly an astonishing achievement. Seeing ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I can understand why Kurowsawa would say that. It is one of the best family films ever made.\n\nFOOTNOTES: Some of the review is information from Helen McCarthy's fantastic book: ""Hayao Miyazaki, Master of Japanese Animation"". It is available at Amazon.com\n\n(Special Update): Since I originally wrote this review, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO has been re-released twice on DVD by Disney, with an updated English dub. The other release is a re-packaged one that was put out at the same time Miyazaki's PONYO was released. This new dub features Dakota Fanning and her real-life sister Elle as Satsuki and Mei. The movie is not only flawlessly dubbed but is completely uncut with the original music and effects soundtrack. My opinion has not been changed. It is still an absolute delight all the way through.";One of the 10 best family films, ever!
84;102.0;1.0;9.0;Beware!\n\nI love this film but Disney has destroyed the charm of the original audio by re-doing the voices. I wanted the full screen version but didn't know they not only changed the voices but also changed the dialog.;Warning- the dialog on this re-release has been changed

65;104.0;2.0;8.0;Sad to say, this Disney version just isn't the same. For me, the original cast of voices are a vital part of the film. Though my absolute FAVORITE movie, I can't seem to enjoy it as much without the original sound. Why re-do something so perfect?;Just not the same as the original
155;105.0;3.0;11.0;The original English dub of this wonderful film is so far superior to the Disney dub.  Dakota Fanning and her sister may be cute in other films but here, their voices are not suited to the characters. The singer gets the songs wrong (who let that happen?), the Japanese-ness of the film is missing--it's lost the charm, the warmth, the love of the original dub.  Disney should not have touched this. We bought it, we started to watch it and then we turned it off.  I don't expect to watch it again and will probably sell it.\n\nI would have given this film 1 star for what Disney did to it--the film as Miyzaki wrote it is a 5+.  Avoid this dub if you can and find the original.  It's soooo much better!;Stars are for Ghibli, not Disney!
159;106.0;4.0;11.0;"Yes, the ""extras"" are poor.  The dubbing is substandard.\n\nNevertheless, this long-awaited release is well worth owning.  Even if only for the opportunity to view this classic film as it should always be presented:  in true widescreen.\n\nThe only time I switched to the English-language audio was during the opening and ending sequences, so I could hear the singing in English.  Odd that some of the credits are subtitled, but the most entertaining aspect--the lyrics--were not.\n\nAfter that, I had no interest in hearing anything but the Japanese soundtrack.  From the subtitles, I can understand the dialogue.  But to hear only the dubbed soundtrack is to ignore the original performances.  Even the most sympathetically created dubbing inevitably obscures the intonation and emotional nuances created by the actors, guided by the director:  these are (at least) as important to the rendering of character as the visuals.\n\nOnly those fluent in Japanese are capable of fully comprehending every aspect of the work.  With subtitles, some meaning is altered, but less so than if one is hearing Hollywood actors pretending to be Japanese characters.\n\nEven with my limited understanding, I could detect a few moments when the subtitles seemed not to be faithful to the script.  But unless the translation is extremely poor, I prefer subtitles.\n\nIf another version's soundtrack dubbed in English is superior,  many parents of small children will seek it.  I've stated my opinion.  But I don't intend to impose it as the one and only way, nor to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the movie.  The more choices, the better.\n\nIt rankles, a bit, to read the back-cover copy:  ""...one of the most delightful and charming family films ever...""  I would not qualify my praise.  This is one of the best films ever.  Of any kind.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro is a small gem--reflecting the wondrous ""everything is new"" experience of childhood--grounded in reality, with elements of magic applied sparingly; a tone neither grim nor overly cute.  Evocative of Japanese rural life and simple everyday pleasures.  The world of the film is suffused with a Shinto-inspired sense of the consciousness of all things, of joyful respect for 'kami'.  Everything is alive:  in both the material and spiritual realms.\n\nIt is unfortunate Disney chose not to include those extras available on the Japanese DVD.  This, I suspect, was intended to save a few dollars:  to avoid having to provide additional translation and subtitles.\n\n(This immense media conglomerate must watch every penny, lest it fall behind the competition?  What competition?  Disney waits impatiently--for the day they are certain will come, inevitably--when they own every character, every story.)\n\nThe popular preconception is that films for children should not be subtitled.  Are there no children hard of hearing?  Are all children incapable of reading subtitles?  We underestimate both their needs and their abilities.\n\nWhy the interminable delay between the time Disney licensed the work of Studio Ghibli, and the date the DVDs were released?  Immersed in a corporate culture which insists Disney is synonymous with feature-length animation--or promotes the delusion that Disney is the only player in the field--some executives might have been attempting to prevent Miyazaki's works from being released at all.";Not as good as it should have been, but still worth the wait
168;107.0;5.0;11.0;"I love this anime and am waiting for the Disney/Buena Vista release for the Japanese language version.  I lived in Japan during the early 1960s, so much in the film reflects the country I knew as a child.  As for those reviewers worrying about the bath scene - get over it.  It's completely innocent.  I used to bathe like that with my grandfather and my grandmother, and sometimes with my parents.  They didn't bother with any false modesty based on prudish ideas.  When I first saw that scene, I felt no worry or upset, but warm nostalgia.  I talked with my sons about it, and how things were back then, and they haven't become twisted.\n\nThe Japanese countryside really did used to look like Miyazaki's backgrounds; my grandmother used to wear the same kind of over-all apron when she cooked.

Of course the 'Fox' dvd went out of print but ""Oh joy!"" it was re-released by Disney. Needless to say, I bought the Disney ""remastered"" version 2 disc thing for a whopping $25 and I have to say... IM SO DISSAPOINTED! Why oh WHY did they think re-dubbing the voices was needed? I really dislike the new dub. Its an abomination and insults the original. If you've seen the original, DO NOT BUY THIS. You will be pretty sad w/ Dakota & Elle Fannings voice acting. At times I even muted it because it was just so far from the original and way annoying. If you can get your hands on the 'Fox' release of the movie... DO. However, if you have never seen this movie or have young kids who have not, don't pass this up.

57;111.0;5.0;7.0;"One of our favorite movies, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is magic for children of all ages, even those of us with whitening hair. You haven't truly lived until you've seen the catbus, with mouse headlights, flying over fields of rice, or perching in a tree. Trees are very important in this tale, similar in rich spiritual significance as J.R.R.

And the voice-work of Dakota and Elle Fanning is spectacular. Immediately, we are drawn into the story, as the kindly professor father of two little girls moves his family to be closer to the hospital where his wife is recovering from a long illness. The girls explore their new home, a haunted old house filled with small-smudge spirits. Wonderful, Japanese windows open wide to beautiful gardens, and a bathhouse with deep tubs for soaking. Tiny creatures, that only the girls can see, collect glowing acorns scattered around the half-wild property; the cuteness of these mini-Totoros is beyond description. Eventually, the young, squeaky-voiced Mei discovers a secret tunnel through the forest to an enormous tree with a hidden entrance to the lair of the Totoro, where she falls into a magic mushroom-lined tunnel to a gentle, beautiful realm. Later, the girls' father shows them a traditional shine next to the massive tree, and explains that the spirit of the forest lives there. Totoro even visits the girls one rainy evening with a leaf on his fizzy head as he enjoys the sounds of raindrops, and then calls the catbus for the first time. Friendship develops between the older sister, Satsuki, and a schoolmate, and his wise grandmother, who watches over the girls. All ends well with their mother recovering, indicated in the closing credits with the addition of a baby brother.

All three of us were nothing less then devastated by Disney's new sound track - for all intents and purposes it is not the same film at all.  The opening song is different and worse.  The new voice overs absolutely take away every aspect of the film that we love so dearly.

130;116.0;5.0;10.0;My mother got My Neighbor Totoro on VHS for my son several years ago. I always liked the movie, and reading the reviews here made me curious enough to buy the full-screen DVD. The first thing I noticed was how much of the original film was cut from the VHS tape- I had always thought of the story as being a little vague and with a very sketchy plot- for instance, the father was nearly nonexistent in my old version, and appeared distant and uninvolved when he was in the movie, which turned out not to be the case at all. The true beauty of the film unfolded and for the first time I saw why My Neighbor Totoro is such a well-loved classic! The original Japanese soundtrack, with the inflections and cute little voices of the children (especially Mei's) really add to the film, even though I don't speak Japanese- the inflections are so much more genuine, and the subtitles are very easy to follow. I plan to get my hands on more Studio Ghibli films right away. If you've only seen the full-screen, dubbed version of this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch the original, subtitled version.;An enormous difference between version!
76;117.0;1.0;8.0;"I have to say that Totoro is one of my favorite childhood movies, ever, and I still love it as an adult. I was pretty excited to see that I could buy it online, because you can't find this movie in stores anywhere, but I was INCREDIBLY disappointed when I recieved it and put it in my DVD player. This movie is a remake of the orignal, and God knows why they would ruin it. The only difference is different voice actors, but like I said, I fell in love with the original and hearing the ""celebrity's"" voices instead of the originals was just wrong. I guess it would be alright if you had never seen this movie before, because you wouldn't notice a thing, but right from the start I knew something was wrong. The voices are all wrong, and I wouldn't be so upset about it, except that it isn't written anywhere that says its a remake. I don't understand why they felt the need to remake a perfectly fine movie anyway. I was looking for the original, and it's not what I got. I just wish it would have been said somewhere on the site or the box that it ISN'T THE ORIGINAL FILM. True, it does say the names on the front of the box, but I had never known the original names so I didn't notice a thing when I bought it. So seriously, if you're looking to rekindle childhood memories, don't buy this version!";Misleading Title
61;118.0;1.0;7.0;First let me say that I love the movie My Neighbor Totoro!  The problem I have is with this Disney version of the movie.  After watching the original version of this movie, in English, on VHS countless times, I wanted to get the DVD version due to the VHS picture deteriorating.  I did not know that not only did they change the voice actors on the Disney version, but they also changed the script.  The changes are subtle, but noticeable.  If you never watched the original VHS version of this movie then you probably will not mind these differences.  But for me, after watching less than a half hour into the movie, I could not watch it anymore.  I really don't know why companies have to do this, but I hate when they do.  I can mention some other anime series where the original was better that the revised editions.  I say leave the originals alone!!  I'll probably end up sending this one back or trading it in.  I will always love the Totoro movie, but will stick to watching the original VHS version instead.  Nice try Disney, but no.  I hope the other versions of the Miyazaki movies released by Disney are not like this.  I have the VHS copy of Kiki's Delivery Service and will compare it to the Disney DVD version that I purchased recently along with the My Neighbor Totoro movie.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed they are the same otherwise I will be very disappointed by Disney again.;Very Disappointed!!
144;119.0;2.0;10.0;The English dub for Disney's new 2-disc version is a pale shadow of the superior original dub done by Fox/Troma. Even my 20-month old daughter could immediately tell the difference, and she insists on the Fox version! If you hear the original dubbing, you will NOT want to buy the Disney version. True, the new release is visually stunning (digitally enhanced animation) but after a while what sticks with you is the audio quality and it's definitely NOT worth it. The songs and the script were completed re-done and are so bland and lifeless! Disney took the heart and soul out of this script, even with the start-studded cast. Having watched this movie over 100 times (it's my daughter's favorite film), the new script dialogue is so dull and the actors sounded like they were just reading aloud. Dakota and Elle Fanning may be little girls in real life but they were awful at animation voiceovers. The grown-up cast wasn't any better... totally dull as dishwater... Are critics just afraid of panning Disney and it's big-named cast?!  I can't believe I paid money for this one... and it was even more expensive than the Fox version.  In fact, I will buy an extra Fox version (before it is discontinued!) because my daughter watches it so much, it's sure to wear out.;This Disney version has NO magic -- check out the original Fox  version instead coz it's 10x bettter!
26;120.0;3.0;5.0;"Downgrading the DVD and Blu-Ray due to the re-recording of the original dialogue, try and find the original VHS (or possibly very early DVD versions, I haven't researched this) if you want a much more meaningful and enjoyable version of this movie.\n\nFor some reason, Disney in their wi$dom, decided to re-record the entire English dialogue track with actors who apparently had more ""Star Power"" than the original dub cast. This was a huge misstep, and so disappointing to my kids and I, who had loved watching our old VHS tape of the original.\n\nI won't go into too much about why it is inferior, though I will say the biggest issue is Dakota Fanning, who plays the older sister  and main character in the story. In the original film the actress played the older sister as being a little bigger than she actually was, as if she was having to convince herself she was strong for the sake of her little sister and father (if you've seen the movie you know what I mean). Dakota just plays it like a generic kid, going through lines like she's in ""Toy Story"" or something, and alot of the meaning and emotional impact of the story is lost. I know it may be silly to argue these fine points of a kids movie, but this one is a masterpiece, and I hated to see it tarnished from what it once was.\n\nI hope one day Disney will release an edition that includes an option for the original English audio, I will snatch that up in a heartbeat.";A masterpiece...but find the original version if you can...
82;121.0;2.0;8.0;"""My Neighbor Totoro"" is certainly one of Hayao Miyazaki's most magical, and it is nice to see the Special Edition version released. But one would expect the Most Special Thing of such a release should be the best quality picture possible for a DVD.\n\nThe Disney-fied English dub -- that is, their propensity to re-record audio using actors whose names the public will better recognize in order to sell these more broadly -- is pretty good. (It's an understandable compromise considering Miyazaki's films deserve wider recognition.) And not too surprising the audio mastering effort given to English was not duplicated for the Japanese language track. (Although it's a bummer!) But it's the same English audio that was released in the widescreen version from 2006. Nothing new here.\n\nThe MOST IMPORTANT of a release is the quality of the movie picture itself -- And Disney sold out and short-changed us. They did not have the film restored nor remastered. Yes, it is better than the Full Screen DVD edition that was released in the early 2000s. But it is not improved on the widescreen DVD version released in 2006. Still, to my eye, it looks too grainy and soft, and with a lot of artifact flicker. It's really a shame, given the advantages of releasing together with ""Ponyo"" that they wouldn't take the opportunity to have Lowry Digital restore this film's image quality like they've had them do for so many Disney animated classics. And for that matter, had Lowry done the work on this we could have seen a Blu-ray edition as well.\n\nThe other Miyazaki films released in this latest Special Edition wave -- ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle In The Sky"" -- have video quality that is not improved over earlier DVD releases, either. These releases are a scar on the legacy of John Lasseter's creative Disney leadership to supposedly champion more 2D animation, and especially because of his affection for Hayao Miyazaki's work. My low rating is a reflection on what Disney has done here, and not on the filmmaking itself.";Disney short-changes this Special Edition
209;122.0;5.0;11.0;"""My neighbor Totoro"" is an animated feature for all ages. The animation in this film is of such a high quality it puts most other animation to shame (including Disney and Pixar). The high level of detail in the animation extends to both the characters and their surroundings. Each frame of the animation is like a piece of artwork. You see shadows on the walls and floors and in the water you see ripples and reflections. The backgrounds are full of everyday items and objects like desk clutter and kitchen items, the sort of items that everyone takes for granted and yet is so often left out of animated features. The artwork and attention to detail all add to the realism of the story.\nThe story line is simple enough for younger children to follow and yet has elements to keep grownups interested. The story follows the lives of a Japanese family over the span of about a month. It's a nice family story with a few fantastical characters like the Soot sprites and the forest spirits. It's a fresh wholesome and upbeat story with no villains or protagonists, family fun at its best. It is a true classic.\nBuy this movie because no matter what your age you will love it. I can't honestly think of anyone that would have any issues with this movie it's a great movie.";A movie for the family or just as a pick me up
223;123.0;5.0;11.0;"This movie can make me feel better no matter what the status of my life. In fact, most times it not only makes me feel better, it usually brings tears of joy to my eyes. It's a remarkable film and my favorite of Miyazaki's works and that is saying more than anything else I might.\nThe plot is relatively simple. Two young girls, Mei (4) and Satsuki (10) movie into a new house with their father. The house seems to be swarming with spirits of the ""Dustbunnies"" and the like. However, Mei finds herself a new friend in the cuddliest spirit of them all, the King of the Forest, Totoro. Totoro is an endearing creature, resembling a largish bear-bunny hybrid, and he befriends the girls and helps them with various things.\nThat being said, some people complain about the DVD's lack of features. Indeed, it is a tragedy that we're not privy to the savory Japanese release, something I was fervently awaiting myself, but it's not as if we're being robbed. It's a ten-dollar DVD! The same price as the VHS and it lasts longer and I've yet to hear of a problem with this edition of the DVD (as with the Neon Genesis movie).\nDisney really takes the films for granted (almost refusing to release the amazing ""Spirited Away"" for a time), but the fans with wear them down I believe and we'll see a special edition soon. Need proof? Disney was forced to push back the release of ""Princess Mononoke"" to DVD because there was an outcry against them for not including the Japanese language track. Take THAT Disney!\nIn closing, the only other thing I can offer is this: more often than not, I'm watching this without the audience of my younger siblings. Actually, they've only seen it once. I keep the treasure mostly to myself. Although I might enlist them to help me with a tree-grow dance this spring...";The Most Beautiful Film in Existence
176;124.0;5.0;10.0;I don't know why I decided to get this movie. To say that I rented it on a whim would even be understatement. In fact, this movie was prehaps my most random find ever, and what a find it was.\n\nMei, age 4, and Satsuki, age 8, are two (very) energetic girls. They just moved out to the country to live in a rickity old house, without a telephone, under a camphor tree. Some people said that the house was haunted, but really, a lot of black soot just hang around there (very similar to the soot in Spirited Away). The girls' mother is in a hospital (presumably with spinal tuberculosis) and their loving father, a professor (I presume), lives with them.\n\nMei meets a troll. Now, this ain't your big ugly Lord of the Rings troll or the mean, sly under-the-bridge troll: this is Totoro- the single coolest creature to ever be painted onto the silver screen. He is adorable, yes freaking adorable, but tough looking, and his tail, oh man, what a tail. It is difficult to transcribe into words how much I love Totoro and want him to be my neigbor.\n\nThe animation is amazing. Nothing short of it. Just like in Spirited Away, some of the paintings look like very beautiful nature photographs. Totoro looks awesome. The girls' emotions are captured perfectly with the pen and easel.\n\nNow, typically, I hate kids in movies. They whine complain and say stupid things or act more mature than the adults. These children do neither. They act like real kids. They have real emotions and real problems. They have vibrant imaginations, but realistic problems. In other words, no movie I have ever seen before, better portrayed children.\n\nGet this movie.;One of the Best Animated Flicks I have Seen...
114;125.0;5.0;9.0;An enchanting movie -- we owned it already in VHS, but wanted it in DVD to last longer -- we have 3 children ages 11 to 6, and they all love it. We expect to watch it for years to come.;My Neighbor Totoro - a great family film
189;126.0;4.0;10.0;"Every good thing you've read in these reviews is correct. This is an absolute feast for the eyes and imagination.... however.... this edition is not widescreen, it's pan & scan (full screen), so you'll miss some of this animator's breathtaking scenery and composition.\nMiyazaki's artistry is such that he uses every single inch of space on a screen, and for me, to watch it in pan & scan is to insult his work. Unfortunately there is no ""complete"" version of the film available here yet, although Disney is supposed to be releasing one when FOX's rights to the film have expired. All the other available works by Miyazaki are done beautifully in the United States. It's a travesty that this ""signature"" film of his is still only available in this ""somewhat less than whole"" version.\nSo buy this and watch it, but only if you promise yourself to re-buy it when the whole film becomes available. I've seen this picture many, many times (I'm 45 years old - so it really is for kids of all ages) and it has something new for me every time I see it.  Plus, I've seen it both wide-screen AND pan & scan (full screen) and I can tell you that the difference is worth seeking out (it's available wide from Japan and China if you own an all-region DVD player) or waiting until it comes out properly here.\nWIDESCREEN - 5 stars\nFull Screen  - 4 (maybe 3.5) stars";Incredible movie - but something's missing (the fifth star!)
90;127.0;1.0;8.0;While this is a wonderful story in its original form (the original  english adaption), this version is awful!  There are no sound effects for the cat bus, the actors' parts are wooden and all of the magic has been leached out by Disney.  I am relieved I kept my vhs copy of this movie because I will not watch the Disney release again.  If I had perhaps looked more carefully, I would have noticed that it was a remake.  I simply did not imagine anyone would change something that was wonderful in the first place.  Shame on Disney for butchering such a classic.;Not the Original!
91;128.0;1.0;8.0;I remember being under ten years old, and going to the grocery store with my mother. And there, they had a small movie section of VHS you could rent. My mother always fought tooth and nail with me because I would always rent My Neighbor Totoro, the FOX version all the time. I grew up with the FOX version, back then, being so young I did not care about extra's etc because back then DVD's were not around yet. I loved this movie, and it is my #1 favorite. I can always put it in and never tire of it. Totoro is nothing short of Amazing, colorful, magical and displays a sense of visual simplicity that engulfs you and mesmerizes any viewer. I more then love this movie. About 2 years ago, we had an anime store near us, that rented out dvds. When I heard Disney was going to be releasing Totoro I was excited! Because I even remember thinking back on all the other Miyazaki films Disney had done, and wondered if they would ever do Totoro. When the anime store got it in, I rented it and came home, popped the disk in, and I could not make it past the scene where Mei and Satsuki are hopping on the rocks around a small pond when they are exploring their new home. I could not finish watching it. I hated it. It almost seems like the Fanning sisters are trying to hard to me, from what I heard of the DVD though it was very little. The voices of Mei and Satsuki in the FOX version did the voices with such fluent simplicity. It sounded more natural, and I think its because I'd grown up on the FOX version that I will never be able to watch any other version, including the Disney version. I'm now nearing 23, and this movie with always captivate me every time I watch it. I'm going to get the Japanese version DVD, because I have yet to watch this in its original dialogue, something I've wanted to do every since I came into Japanese animation.\n\nMy advice, if you have the FOX version, even though it may be bad quality and no extras, which I totally agree with, if anything appreciate it for the dubbing voices. Overall better then Disney's portrayal in every way shape and form. If I ever bought this DVD it would only be for the Japanese dialogue.\n\nOne of my favorite movies of all time. I love all of Miyazaki's movies, and I wish to obtain them all. Studio Ghibli is simply amazing, I recommend all Miyazaki films.;Fox Dubbing is Better. Disney is Not!
70;129.0;3.0;7.0;"What I did NOT know before getting this was that there are two different English dubbed versions: one by Fox, and one by Disney released in 2006. (Why people are posting reviews for the Fox version here baffles me--this listing is for the DISNEY version, right??)\n\nLong story short, the Disney version stinks. It's pretty well-known among the anime community that dubs usually do stink, and over 15 years after first watching Totoro I always thought Fox had done an exceptional job avoiding this stereotype...but Disney ruined it. Let me count the ways!\n\n- This might be trivial to most consumers, but the woman who sings the opening and closing themes cannot hold a note. Also, for some reason the ending theme has a pop-country flair to it. These songs are nostalgic and meaningful to me, and it was hard to hear them re-recorded this way. The woman who sang in the Fox version had a very pleasant voice and there were no pop-music additions.\n\n- Part of what brings the characters to life are the non-verbal vocal noises they make, like ""hmm""s and grunts and the like. The Disney actors left out so much of those, and left awkward silence between lines instead. This was especially noticeable with Totoro's character, who doesn't have any speaking lines. How can you take away those little grunts he makes when he smiles and opens his eyes wide and really expect him to be the same? The Cat-bus received similar treatment.\n\n- Going off the last point, the acting, particularly for Satsuki and Mei, was sub-par, ESPECIALLY when pitted against their previous English voices, which were so lively and well-executed. I really didn't think the snooty tone of voice that Satsuki addressed Mei with when she found her sleeping in the forest fit her character well.\n\n- The casting! UGH! I'll give Disney a few brownie points for casting the Dad, Mom, and Granny with actors whose voices were very similar to the previous actors', but Satsuki and Mei sounded like they were barely a year apart. Mei's previous voice was babyish and cute, and gave the impression that she was much younger than her older sister. Except for a few energetic moments from Satsuki, I felt the delivery of both her and Mei's lines was poor and emotionless in the newer Disney version.\n\n- **SPOILER ALERT**The script was different--in some places significantly different, although not enough to alter the main plot. Some of the changes would have been better left out; others helped the story make a little more sense. I have mixed feelings about these changes; however, I had a huge problem with the scene that comes after Satsuki and Mei find out that their hospitalized mother has a cold and won't be able to return home yet. In the old version, Satsuki appears very worried and distressed over her mother, and finally bursts into tears when she wonders aloud, ""What are we going to do if Mommy dies? What are we going to do, Nanny??"" As both a child and an adult, I always found this scene to be very moving.\n\n**SPOILER ALERT CONT.**In the Disney version, she's pitching an uncharming fit about how the hospital is So Unfair for not letting Mom come back home, and inserts an unnecessary hyperbole of ""She's probably DEAD already!"" multiple times. I felt that this was very inappropriate behavior for a cartoon character to display to children, especially considering the gravity of the situation! Then all of a sudden, Satsuki bursts into tears! Not only was it inappropriate, but poorly executed as far as the acting goes. Forget the fact that I felt absolutely no sympathy toward her for being a whiny brat.\n\nWith all that said and done, here is my recommendation:\n\nIf you are an anime fan, buy this version ONLY for the Japanese audio and the extras. That may be all you care about, and if so that's great, but if you're like me and want to share your childhood memories with your children, make sure to get the DVD of the 1994 version as well.\n\nIf you are a parent of young children, either version (Fox or Disney) is probably ok, but I recommend the Fox (1994) version if only because of the last scene I described.  In and of itself, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful movie with no scary antagonists to defeat and a strong sense of familial bonds. I think it's a great addition to any child's movie collection.";Disney broke my childhood
138;130.0;5.0;9.0;"First off i would like to say, i own both copies of the movie.\n\nI enjoyed this movie fully. It's widescreen presentations was flawless and full of color. It also had a number of extras on this dvd.\n\nNext debate, the new dub. Ok, I completely understand why people don't like this dub...i don't like it as well as the Fox Totoro dub either. Before this was out all anyone could do is complain about the acting on the Fox Totoro, now everyone prefers it.\n\nI watched My neighbor Totoro when i was young. It was my favorite movie. We only rented it though. Then years later (about a year or two ago). I found the Fox version in a walmart bargain bin of dvds. I couldn't believe my eyes, memories rushed back as i grabbed it and bought it. I really loved watching it.\n\nThen a few years later this one comes out. Disney does a great job at these Ghibli movies. So i did not hesitate to buy the movie again. Not only is it widescreen, but it has the original japanese version. I am not big on Japanese versions, but its always nice to run through once.\n\nFirst thing i thought...They redid the song. Same words new vocals. It was nice. then Wow they sound older than they look...I know Dakota Fanning is a great young actress, but she sounded older than the previous one who played her. I also noticed a lot of dialouge changes. I don't know anything about japanese so i don't know which was more accurate. But it kinda made me feel bad...They aren't soot gremlins they  are dust bunnies. I have known them as dust bunnies all my life, then they change it to soot gremlins.........that makes me sick......Even when i first saw spirited away i said ""Look its the dust bunnies"". Course they called them soot sprites...which still sounds better than soot gremlins. That is the only real thing i hated about this movie.\n\nI picked up my fox dvd for only $5.50 at wal mart. This one for $20 at wal mart. Both i love, disney for the quality, and Fox for the original dialogue and voices i have grown to love.\n\nI still give this 5 stars despite the soot gremlin horror.\n\nIf the dub bugs you that much. I would buy the fox version. What i do, is since i have a ps2 and a dvd player. I put one in each, wire the disney video, and the fox sound together with the cables and then start them at the same time. That way i get my favorite dialogue and good video.";Great animated movie
234;131.0;5.0;11.0;I've got a dozen or so movie and educational videos for children in my collection.  My twin three year olds ask for this video most often.  They quote the characters and pretend to fly around the room clutching onto the Totoro's chest as Tsatsuki and Mei do.\nThe plot does develop slowly, and they can get a little restless a half hour into it, but it is made up for by the charming, furry Totoro creature.  They are engrossed in the story once the Totoro enters the plot.\nI had read the plot review, which described two young girls moving to the country with their father, and thought thematically it would apply to me, a single father sharing equally and separately in raising my children.  The mother, however, is not absent but sick in the hospital waiting to return home.  I'm afraid I may have prolonged the hope of my children that their mother will return to my home.  This is probably not a concern for most people however.\nThe animation is simply beautiful.  I don't mind watching this video with the kids because of the gorgeous scenery.  This is not another kids movie cranked out bya money-making studio.  You can tell that the work behind the movie was a labor of love and skill - all the more reason to buy the video.;"""Daddy, can we watch the Totoro video again?"""
196;132.0;4.0;10.0;"I'm of two minds about FOX's Totoro release.  On the one hand, this is truly one of the great animated classics of our time, a fun, beautiful, and imaginative story, sure to be enjoyed by children from pre-school to post-grad. ;)  I highly recommend it to any parents with young children, as it is very easily enjoyed by both parents and kids watching together.\nOn the other hand, as a serious collector of Miyazaki's work, I find the release to be slightly substandard.  Full-screen-only, dub-only, and lacking in the neat special features that highlight Disney's releases, this film might disappoint the serious viewer.\nIn short: if you have kids, buy it, and buy it soon.  But if you want the best, most collectable and complete version of this film, import the Region 2 DVD.";A modern classic
146;133.0;1.0;9.0;"O that I could have had a heart attack just before I had seen this version, so that I could leave this world ignorant of the horrors of Disney's re-release. I have so many complaints about this version that I can't count them all, but for now I'll stick with the biggest ones: Voice-Acting, Music, Sound Effects, and Translations.\n\nFirst off voice-acting was just plain horrible. Not only that, but I kept wanting to turn the sound down, because every syllable seemed to be screamed at me. The voices don't even seem to fit the way the characters look. I remember watching the original American release as a kid of about 5 or 6, and even then thinking that the voices fit, but now...\n\nNow the music is just as bad, if not worse than the voices. I found that you kept hearing the same four measures, over and over throughout the entire movie. In my opinion there was also way too much emphasis on the strings. A good score needs contrast, especially if it's a score to a Japanese movie, which already has a different feel than an American one.\n\nAlong the same lines are the sound effects, which are very (though thankfully not completely) different, from the original. A great example is when Satsuke is waiting with Totoro for the bus. In the original you could hear how hard the rain was coming down, but now there are just a few highlighted drops here and there.\n\nLastly the translation is much worse than the original release. Many words are either added, changed, or dropped for no apparent reason. I guess that's what you get for buying a Disney movie. Yet another thing that bothered me about the translating, was that they kept calling Satsuke as ""Satsuki."" (Just one of my pet peeves. I hate when foreigners change pronunciations of words in other languages, when the original is just fine.)\n\nIn conclusion I will say to all of you who are looking to buy this DVD to, recapture the magic you found when watching the original as a kid, buy the FOX DVD, and skip this one. The only redeeming quality of this version is that it has the original Japanese, but that hardly compensates for the rest.";How can a movie be this bad?

179;137.0;5.0;9.0;My Neighbor Totoro is great fun for adults and children alike. It also gives one a glimpse of 1940's era Japan, replete with scenic rice paddies, fashion, culture and tradition. Satsuki packs an oishii (delicious) lunch box for her family as she helps her father, a professor at a local University cope with the illness and absence of his wife.\n\nMeanwhile a mystical Neko-bas (cat buss) gives the eldest daughter and her little sister (Mei) a ride to see their mother in the hospital. This tale is filled with delightful Totoros ranging from the smallest (kototoro) to the largest (ototoro) who greets the children with a mighty roar, however let's them fall asleep on his belly...Simply charming. The film maker, Hayao Miyazaki, contributes a valuable new addition to the world of animation comparable, yet distinct from Disney's finest classics. Jyodeki (very good).;Simply Charming

I was only interested in this movie because of Hayao Miyazaki, having seen Spirited Away and falling in love with it.

English does tend to sound American quite often, heh, and, English speaking children relate to it, I believe.\n\nIt's too bad that in the first page on Amazon, the negative reviews pull up toward the top.

The original English dub on the VHS release is far superior.  Unfortunately the English dub in this version has been completely Americanized, losing much of the charm of the original.  You can see the difference if you turn on the English soundtrack along with the English subtitles.  The subtitles are a much better reflection of the original Japanese language script.  At least you can watch the dvd in Japanese with English subtitles, bypassing the poor dub.\n\nIt's a shame Disney apparently felt that Americans would not appreciate a real ""Japanese"" flavored film, which to me is a big part of this movie's charm.\n\nThat said, My Neighbor Totoro is still a wonderful film, for children and adults and it's great to finally own a widescreen copy on dvd.";THE NEW 2 DISC DVD VERSION - DUB NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL
162;148.0;5.0;8.0;In a career full of animation masterpieces this may be Hayao Miyazaki's best film. Less complicated than his other films but still very inventive it follows 2 lonely young girls who befriend magical creatures of the forest. When their sick mother in the hospital doesn't come back home they try to reach her with the help of their new friends. Purposely slow and saturated with a love of nature the film perfectly captures the feel of lazy sunny days and beautifully lush green forests. Gorgous old fashioned animation has a warmer feel than all the computer animation nowadays. For an animated film the girls are very believable and despite some bizarre sights like the chesire cat bus the film never turns goofy. Miyazaki has made more complex action packed films in his career but to me this love poem to nature,family and magic is his most satisfying.;One of the most magical films ever made
163;149.0;2.0;8.0;"As a child, I adored Totoro. So it was no surprise that I was more than eager to see the new 2 disc set of it. However, what I got was not all that I'd hoped for.\n\nTotoro is a classic children's movie, and one of the best. The story is touching, and the characters endearing. But what was sorely missing from this re-release was a surprising lack of vocal talent. While the supporting cast was great, poor Satsuki and Mei were grossly miscast as Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning. I wonder if Disney even auditioned children for these roles or just thought to themselves, ""Hey, who is a popular child actor that might bring in money?"" Satsuki (voiced by Dakota Fanning) sounds about 3 or 4 years too young for her age, and half the time she sounds dead. The other half of the time she delivers several of her lines very oddly and inappropriate for the scene that they are in. A good example would be when Satsuki offers an umbrella to Totoro, telling him to hurry and take it because her sister (whom she is carrying) is slipping. Ms. Fanning delivers this line in an excited, almost giddy manner, despite the fact that her character is currently shifting around the weight of a small child on her back. It just sounds odd. And Mei is just plain annoying. Half on Elle Fanning's lines are screeched out in such a high pitch voice it practically makes your ears bleed, and the other half of her lines are, literally, high pitched screams. These two young ladies ruined what would have been a decent dub (with the exception of the newly dubbed Catbus which is also disappointing).\n\nMy advice to you is to either buy a copy of the original dub of Totoro, or watch it in Japanese if you buy this version.";Long Awaited, But Highly Disappointing
164;150.0;4.0;8.0;"The rather tardy ""deluxe"" DVD release of Japanese animation master Miyazaki's first big hit proves to be a mixed blessing of sorts. On the one hand, it's great to finally have a version with the original Japanese soundtrack, and in widescreen (I think that is the main thing that cinephiles/serious anime collectors have been salivating for). However, Disney decided to record an entirely new voice-over session for the English dub track, which is, as other reviewers have astutely observed, a somewhat pointless excercise. Perhaps the company thought they could move even more units if they had the name of a current child actor du jour (Dakota Fanning) on the jacket? It is also annoying that in order to obtain the widescreen Japanese version, you're forced to pay a steep price because this little 90 minute gem has now been bloated into a ""deluxe"" 2-disc set. Personally, I find the ""making of"" documentaries on all the Disney Miyazaki releases to be fairly interchangable (With an artist like Miyazaki, I don't necessarily NEED to know how the man behind the mirror makes the magic-I just want to experience it.) As for the film itself-as you can glean from all the glowing reviews on this site, it's a winner. I've always felt ""My Neighbor Totoro"" to be Miyazaki's most simplistic piece (I'm talking storyline, not animation quality, which is stunning as always) but perhaps that explains why it remains his most  universally popular ""family"" film. Most of the patented Miyazaki themes are present (young female protagonist, respecting nature, white magic, the ability to fly), but it plays now like a ""Cliff's Notes"" blueprint for the more mature and complex work that was to follow. Still, this one is not to be missed!";Love the cat bus, but I'd hate to be the mechanic

178;154.0;5.0;8.0;"Before kids, I watched this movie about once a year or so, or whenever I was feeling down.  It is a pure, sweet, innocent joy to watch, and seeing it always made me feel a little happier.\n\nWhat was even better was introducing it to my 3 year old and discovering that we could enjoy watching it together.  There are no guns, no violence, no bad words, no loud obnoxious songs or characters;  but lots of quiet spaces, beautiful and inspiring animation (if you've read a little about Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki you know that Disney animators revere him, and even use his films to draw inspiration), realistic and 3 dimensional characterization (Mei and Satsuki act age appropriate - !!), and a story that really draws you into caring for this imaginary family.  Responsibility and respect for others, for family, for the world around you is embedded so deeply in this movie that I feel a little less bad about letting my son watch it so much.\n\nFox has done a wonderful, respectful dub of this movie, but their DVD release is nothing but a simple transfer from the VHS.  If you are looking for any extras or the original japanese, you'll just have to wait for the Disney take on it.  If it is going to be anything like the other releases, it will have the original japanese audio on it.  When they do, don't forget to check out the original japanese theme songs.  Too cute!\n\nSpeaking of Disney, it truly boggles my mind that now that it has the distribution rights for this movie, it has not gotten its act together and done a proper release.  I was all set to buy the DVD back in June 2004 (when I first noticed it scheduled for release), then in August, then in February.  But then Totoro was abrubtly, and inexplicably taken off of the release schedule, and _The Cat Returns_ put in its place, which is a semi-sequel to *another*  as yet to be released Ghibli movie (huh?!) by Disney to the US. (Incidentally, _Whisper of the Heart_, the predecessor of _The Cat Returns_ ,is my favorite Ghibli movie, and I am curious to see how they deal with the particular difficulty of translating it since it is soooo Japanese)\n\nIf Disney were smart (but they're not, they're mercenary, and don't like Miyazaki's old classic material eclipsing and eating into the profits of their latest and worst sequels to mediocre movies - what's next, Hercules 2? Ack!), they would have set the release date for these movies closer to the holidays.  In delaying the release of Totoro, yet again, they are just giving more money to Fox, as irritated fans buy the DVD because their VHS copy is wearing a little thin from the repeated viewing.\n\nIf Disney were *really* smart, they'd actually release this movie in theatres.  It would make me so happy to have this movie be the very first movie I could take my son to see.

102;158.0;1.0;7.0;A long time ago me and my family sat down and watched the original dub of My Neighbor Totoro. We were completly blown away. It became one of our all time favorite movies. It was so amazing, so different from anything we had ever seen. My little sister fell completely in love with it, and watched it whenever she had a chance.\n  When we saw this new special two-disk, digitally remastered set was relesed we didn't wait for a second to buy it. We popped it into the DVD player completely enthralled.  We got about ten minutes into the movie before turning it off in complete disbelief and anger.\n  I can't understand why they would do something like this. Why would they take an amazing, wonderful piece of art and smash it into pieces? I have nothing against Dakota Fanning or her little sister, but their voice performances were NOTHING compared to the original. You get a COMPLETLY different experience watching this new version. I just couldn't understand why they would do something like this. The least they could have done was include the original dubbing, instead of leaving you to choose between a complete insult to Miyazaki or the japanese voices.;Why would they do somethig like this?
83;159.0;4.0;6.0;"As one of my favorite films of all time, I was crushed to have to give this release four stars.  I had high hopes for a Disney release, and the one bonus is the anamorphic (widescreen) presentation.  The trouble is with the re-recorded dialogue.  A cast of stars (Dakota Fanning, etc.) lend their voices, but the charm and spark is lessened.  In particular Mei's voice and vocabulary (the youngest girl) is no longer that of a toddler.  For example, earlier releases translated her discovery of tadpoles in a stream as a verbal struggle, saying ""golly-pollywogs!"".  In this release she just says ""Tadpoles!"".  Endearing touches like that make the Troma translation clearly a work of love.  Disney's translation is perhaps more literally correct, but colder and more corporate for it.\n\nUpdate: Now that my 2.5 year old daughter has seen it several times (and become addicted) I feel I should temper my review.  If SHE finds the spark in it, perhaps it simply is different from my expectations.  I still believe a younger voice for Mai would be ideal, but now I'm just being picky.";New dialogue damages charm

It will have an all-new English language cast, widescreen presentation and a second disc of bonus features.  Two other films will be released the same day - Porco Rosso and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  I know I'll be replacing my Fox p& s version of Totoro then.;Wait for the new release
191;161.0;4.0;8.0;Tonarino Totoro is 3rd movie for Miyazaki. In Japan roadshow, the movie was showed with [Hotaruno Haka]. I like latter movie in the point that expressed the real story, the poverty of World War2. But the person's favorite movie will be different by individual tendency. I had the tendency that liked documental and truth story than fantasy story. Off course for young children or the person that like fantasy, Totoro will be the best movie. The two movie before Totoro was fantasy but war and agressive movies. Totoro was a first movie that there was not war scene. When we watch such a point, the movie will be safe movie that child can watch. And the character of Totoro is also very cute and unique, Totoro off course,[Neko bus=cat bass]etc.\nBut Mr. Miyazaki did not forget to include his messages to this movie. Maybe foreigners would feel unique things in the movie atomospher, for instance, big forests or secret paassages etc. But there was such scenery in Japan in fact. And the sketch was done in Tokyo. Though I have lived in Tokyo more than 20 years, I have not cared about such scenery. Off course though what nature is losing will be truth, but in addition to that, I think that Miyazaki want to tell us that we should notice the nature, even if here is downtown city.\nThe movie that Miyazaki make is included the important messages. Even if watcher is not Japanese, will be able to think about the messages. That is to say, nature is one of imoportant things for human.\nAnd I am surprised that many U.S,A people knew Miyazaki's movies. I can understand the reason that is said that Japan is anime country.\nI am sorry for my poor English.;Mr. Miyazaki's 3rd movie
59;162.0;5.0;5.0;Set against the backdrop of rural postwar Japan, Hayao Miyazaki's 'My Neighbor Totoro' is the story of two sisters' discovery of friendly wood spirits. Upon moving into a house, the girls discover a fantastical world both in their new home and in the environment around them - dust spirits, cat buses, and Totoros (3 of them!) While they learn the secrets of the world around them, the Totoros help the girls navigate the sadness of their mother's separation from them. With the Totoros' help, the girls manage to find a new emotional balance that helps them to come to terms with their mother's absence.\n\nIf you're familiar with Studio Ghibli's films, then you know each film begins with the depiction of Totoro. And Totoro is so famous and well-loved that he even makes cameos in other films - in Toy Story 3 as a plushie for instance. This story is really heart warming and now that I've watched the film twice, I have to say that it ranks in the top ten animated films of all time for me. There are just certain moments that will leave you smiling - waiting at the bus stop, for instance, when Totoro discovers the pleasures of droplets falling on an umbrella. Also, now continuing in my Studio Ghibli watching, I have noticed some patterns. It seems Disney was not the only one obsessed with a mother's separation from her children. The first four Studio Ghibli films (Nausicaa*, Castle in the Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, and Totoro) all have an absent or separated mother. Just something to note and see if the pattern holds down the road.\n\nAdditionally, if you have some knowledge of Japanese cultures and religions, then this story will make perfect sense given that the Japanese have traditionally believed in Animism, a belief system where animals and plants are imbued with spirits. Seriously, if you haven't watched this film, watch it. If you've already watched it, watch it again.\n\n*Technically not a Studio Ghibli film, but whatever.;Tooooo Toooooo Rooooo.

111;164.0;5.0;7.0;"A lot of people are on here giving this movie low marks because of the Disney re-dub of the English soundtrack. They complain that the ""original"" is better. Folks, the ""original"" soundtrack is in Japanese! What I notice most of the complaintants are NOT mentioning are the story and the fantastic animation. This film is ""standard Miyazaki fare"" - which is like standard Michaelangelo fare, or standard Mozart fare or standard Shakespeare fare. Miyazaki (and the fine people at Studio Ghibli) is an artist of that same caliber. His films should not be missed!\n\n""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a wonderful film that everyone can enjoy. I, like many others here, put off watching this film because Totoro looked too ""cute"". I expected a standard, Americanized saccharine-sweet story. I never expected what I got. As with virtually every other Miyazaki film, the characters are portrayed exceptionally well, very three dimensional and very human. I almost felt I was watchinng my own two daughters. The story is delightful, human and interesting. The animation is a feast for the eyes. Whichever version you watch, please do watch ""My Neighbor Totoro""; you will not be disappointed!";Standard Miyazaki Fare
241;165.0;5.0;9.0;"This film is satisfying on several levels:\n1) animation is done with extreme care; 2) plot is leisurely and well scoped; 3) the relationships - human and non-human are done very well. 4) original and a very nice break  from Disney\nI recommend this film to anyone with a child or even a  child's sense of wonder.  For those who prefer a gritty plot, explosions,  and relationships fraught with trauma this is not your film.\nMany films  both animated and regular place children as horrible stereotypes which this  film does not.  Not too sweet nor too jaded - a good balance is struck here  for all the characters involved.\nI recommend this film in particular to  people who have daughters.  Studio Ghibli has always done wonderful work  with females as lead characters.  Female characterization by Ghibli is the  most solid of all the anime studios and alas, many regular film studios.  The female characters are done with depth and a certain understanding that  is rare.  You see this further in such films as _Kiki's Delivery Service_,  _Castle LaPuta_, and _Porco Rosso_.  I have yet to come away from a Ghibli  film that the word, ""wow"", was not attached.  If you are  fortunate and get a chance to truly see the animation say this to yourself,  ""this was all drawn by Miyazake"" and not a stable of artists or  computer generated (except for parts of Princess Mononoke).\nIf you are  fearful of the accusations and stereotypes of Japanese animation being too  stylized, stiff, or lacking in plot that is sensible then see _Totoro_ or  any Ghibli Studio product and see if they say the same thing afterwards.  Further, take a look at the reviews from non-anime fans.  It says something  that they are moved as well.\nFor parents I would say that this work will  cause a sense of wonder and enjoyment for their young children.  Get used  to your children drawing the catbus and questions (children will ask where  is Totoro and the dust bunnies).  Not a bad tradeoff in consideration the  alternative is Pokemon (blech!)\nAs anecdote -- my co-worker thought my  Totoro doll was hellaciously weird and ugly.  Time passes and now a gray  Totoro graces her desk.\nWatch and enjoy.  This quality of stuff rarely  passes through our media soaked world so unscathed.";worth every dime

Amazon tends to print the same reviews for differing versions of a same title and it can get really perplexing at times--in one case two entirely different movies that happened only to share the same title shared reviews. I wrote to Amazon about this but never received a response.\n\nWith that out of the way (and I think with little need to stress the fact that this is a spectacular family film), let me be an advocate of one approach here. Even if you're showing this to children (and please, watch this with them, you'll be delighted), make every effort to watch it in the original Japanese, with subtitles, and read for them if needed. Reasons are:\n\n A) As much as I hate to admit it, I now never find much merit in American dubbings of any film. The reason is that once a foreign film gets into the hands of American producers, they feel a need--sometimes a subtle and well-intended one--to ""Americanize"" the film. There's nothing innately bad about this but almost always, if you go to the original and listen very carefully to the emotions and inflections of a language you may not even understand, you'll find that the original film makes much more ""emotional"" sense than the American version. Anything Disney does is particularly suspect since it tends to operate (to its financial detriment, we've noticed) in High-Power Marketing Mode nearly all of the time so it will try to go for ""names"" in dubbing rather than pay strict attention to artistic needs*. I've worked with Disney on some projects and frankly they need someone to talk to them and help them get back to another world of magic entirely.\n\nB) Kids, more than anyone, pick up on the emotional content of language and will, if you give them the chance, find more of value in the original language films, even if subtitles may be a minor barrier. This is also the best way to start them on a path of appreciating other cultures and non-American film product which (even I'm now realizing) is often of finer artistic merit.\n\nC) The Japanese, with an ancient theatrical traditional, field spectacular actors and the voice talent that turns up in these movies is often as good as can be hoped for. This particular film is beautifully acted. In what I've encountered, Japanese actors generally portray finer ranges and nuances of emotion and manage gentleness and innocence particularly well. Your kids will pick up on this.\n\n*The recent ""Howl's Moving Castle"" used Billy Crystal for the voice of the Fire Demon. Listen to the original and compare. Crystal was brilliant in Monsters Inc.--the part being pretty much written for him--but here he's sadly under-utilized and his wise-crack delivery is more than a little out-of-place. Disney really tried too hard to pack this one with ""names.""";Amazon makes things confusing!
88;171.0;5.0;6.0;"In recent years, many ""family films"" have not been enjoyable for the whole family. Instead of making them so that both the kids and the parents can enjoy them, they are often made so only the kiddies will enjoy them (I'm lookin' at YOU Nickelodeon). These films are loud, obnoxious, rude and simply unbearable. However, there are also a few family films that have been enjoyable for all ages. The most prominent examples being the films of Pixar and Studio Ghibli. Out of all of these films, this little gem, ""My Neighbor Totoro"", may just be the finest family film of all. The premise is simple: Two little girls with a sick mother move out to the country with their father, exploring the surrounding forest and interacting with the spirits that inhabit it, such as the big furry Totoro. That's pretty much it. While it doesn't sound like engaging cinema, it has a warm, touching atmosphere with an emphasis on the importance of family togetherness. While it is a fine family film, it is also a wonderfully experimental art film. Instead of relying on a conventional plot, it explores it's world with a childlike sense of wonder, taking life one step at a time. The human characters have surprisingly real personalities, and are somehow able to get along with each other for the most part. The spirits also fit surprisingly well into the realistic world, as if they really did exist. This film also has the most detailed and beautiful backgrounds you'll ever see in a film. The beautifully crafted plants make you want to go outside and explore nature (after you're done watching the movie, of course). One thing that really irks me however, is that many fans give this wonderful film one measly star, simply because they didn't like Disney's dub. Many people seem to prefer Fox's dub from the early nineties, but I don't see why. I haven't seen the whole film with the Fox dub, but all I know is this: The girls are voiced by adults (adults never sound like authentic children), the father has a deep, scratchy voice (COMPLETELY out of character), and Totoro and Catbus don't even have voices (SERIOUSLY?!? They had voices in the Japanese version, why don't they have them in the Fox dub?!?). Also, the cover art makes it look like one of those Disney musical rip-offs that were so common in the nineties. These are my opinions, anyway. One reason why I would say that Disney's dub is a better buy, is that it includes the original Japanese audio track, while the Fox dub does not. That way, if you really do dislike Disney's dub, or just hate dubbing in general, you can watch the film in it's original language without having to buy an overpriced import from Japan. Also, I don't think Disney's dub is as bad as anime snobs let on. This really is one of Hayao Miyazaki's best works.";A truly sublime film from the master of animation.
139;172.0;4.0;7.0;"Okay, I will probably never watch this with the English dub, so I have nothing to add in the never-ending debate between the quality of the Disney vs. Fox dubs.  That said, I do have a few things to say concerning the Disney version (and watching it in Japanese with English subtitles).\n\nPros:\n1. I commend Disney for NOT adding extra dialog during the many quiet moments.  As someone said, Miyazaki films (and many Japanese animations in general) make good use of quiet moments, and they should not be ruined with dialog that's not supposed to be there.  (I hope the dub doesn't add dialog either.)  And I like that the sound effects (like laughing) aren't needlessly translated.\n\nCons:\n1. This first is the greatest ""Con.""  During the opening and closing songs, there's no English subtitles for the song lyrics.  Instead, there's only a translation of the credits.  Why???  We're missing two very nice songs that help introduce the movie and gives a nice summary of Totoro.  In comparison, who cares about the credits?  Does the special feature ""Opening and closing animation without credits"" include English subtitles for the song lyrics?  You'd hope so, but they don't!  Even when you turn the subtitles on, it doesn't display anything... even though there are no credits to translate.  Of my 3 complaints, this is the worst one, because it takes away from the intro and denoument.  Some of the ""magic"" is lost.\n2. The ""anamorphic widescreen"" is cropped on the sides and a little on the bottom.  I have a Chinese (or Japanese?) version that has a fuller picture.  Even though I haven't watched that version in over a year, when I watched the new Disney version for the first time, I could already tell it was missing some of the picture.  The image seemed claustrophobic.\n3. This one's more a matter of personal preference, but the subtitles cover up the beautiful animation.  In some scenes, the subtitles cover up the main characters, obscuring the ""action.""  Granted, this may be intended for those with widescreen TV's, but I prefer them in the bottom black bar.  I can move the subtitles lower using my DVD player, but I can't on my laptop.\n\nI really love this movie.  It's a great film with great imagery and characteres.  I'd give the film 5 stars, but the DVD I can only give a 3.  So the average is a 4.\nWhy can't Disney or someone put out a version that doesn't mess with the content?  (The problem with the Chinese/Japanese version is that extra dialog is added where there is no original Japanese dialog.)";For those looking for: Japanese with English Subtitles...
141;173.0;5.0;7.0;"As an exchange student to Japan, I saw Totoro in Japanese years ago and loved it.  When I had this chance to buy the DVD for my girls (ages 2 and 4), I didn't hesitate. It is one of those shows that children adore.  My husband and I enjoy sitting next to them and being a part of the magic.  (You can't say that about all children's movies...)  My girls aren't big movie watchers- the four-year old deems most Disney movies to be too scary to watch.  But Totoro is different.  They love watching Mei land on Totoro's chest, and the cat bus is fantastic.  They also march around the room during the part where the girls try to get the acorns to sprout.  Although we were concerned about it, it doesn't bother them one bit that Satsuki and Mei's mom is in the hospital for the entire movie. Another neat part about the show from a parent's point of view: older sister Satsuki takes care of little Mei and her Daddy during the movie- she makes lunches for the family and holds Mei at the bus stop.  After we watch the show, my older daughter always wants to ""be like Satsuki"" by helping out around the house and fussing over her little sister.  We've bought it several times as a present.";Pure Magic for Kids and Parents- Satsuki's a good sister!
145;174.0;3.0;7.0;"Like several other people, I grew up watching Fox's version of Totoro. I've also lived and went to high school in Osaka for a spell, and have watched the original version on several occasions.\n\nThis has been one of the most magical movies in my life since I was younger, and I'm thrilled that Disney decided to release several Miyazaki/Ghibli movies.\n\nSo far, Disney has done wonderfully in my opinion, with other voice-overs of these films and with preserving the overall feel that the movie was originally supposed to have.\n\nThey had quite a challenge, however, following the magnificent job that Fox had done years earlier.  A lot of ""diehard fans"" may or may not argue that Fox did a good job- I loved it because while some things may not have been directly translated (the opening theme), the overall feeling of the movie stayed the same and the voices fit wonderfully with the characters. Totoro is a kid's movie- it always has been and always will be, so I believe that it should be presented as such... it just happens to be a kid's movie that has a little magic in it for people of other ages, as well.\n\nThe voice acting in this version is well done, as is the translation job of course (this -is- Disney), but to people who are used to either hearing the original movie or the Fox version, a little something new might come as a shock to the ears.  It is still a perfectly wonderful version, but I have to wonder if the voice actors they chose were the best choices they could have made.  I don't say this often, as people like Kirsten Dunst who did an -awsome- job with Kiki are certainly suited for the job, but I wondered if Disney didn't just pick people for their star names, instead of how well they did in their roles.\n\nI'm not saying that anyone performed badly, but I think that there are several other people out there with more (or maybe none) experience in voice acting that would be able to handle the voice-over job in a way that would fit in more with the movie.\n\nThe girls, of course, sounded good acting wise, but left a bit to be desired.. too often did I feel like they were too disconnected from the movie and what exactly was going on, and just ended up reading the lines well and not trying to fit what they were saying into the big picture.\n\nIf you pick up this movie, I recommend also trying out Fox's version as well- it's worth it to watch.\n\nI appreciate Disney for translating these wonderful movies, and they do an excellent job- I just hope that they are a little more careful in choosing stars as voice actors- sometimes it pays to pick a cast with a little more experience or skill, but less fame.";A little bias may play into how one might view this movie.
147;175.0;1.0;7.0;I have to agree with just about every other reviewer of this DVD. My brothers and I grew up watching the original Totoro dub by Fox and we still love and enjoy it. However when we watched the new Disney dub none of us could sit through it, the voice cast was extremly uninspired and monotone--only the two parent voice overs Lea Solanga and Tim Daly did an admirable job. It is really unfortunate that Disney could not improve on the original.;New Dub Un-Listenable

Jo Hisaishi's terrific score deserves loving care.\n\nThe positive here is that the visuals are better.  I was glad for the wider format, and the colors were more vibrant, closer to the amazing color of Spirited Away, the best colored animation in many years.\n\nI wish I could show this version with the Fox soundtrack.";A step backward in the performances

89;178.0;3.0;6.0;This is one of our all-time favorite movies.  My kids grew up with the original VHS version.  The three stars were given because this is NOT the same version that we remembered and although we love the movie, we hate this version.  This version has different voices, some different music and even different spoken lines in some places. We were very disappointed with these changes.  After doing some research, we realized our mistake.  This DVD version is different because it was put out by Disney whereas the original was put out by Fox.  Apparently, there are two versions of this movie and we prefer the Fox version much better.  Even though the Disney version has the celebrity voices of Tim Daly and Dakota Fanning, it lacks the quirky joy of Hayao Miyazaki's original version.

160;179.0;5.0;7.0;"CAVEAT:\n\nAs a first-time watcher, I can't compare the 2 English dubs. The 2006 release with Dakota Fanning seemed perfectly natural to me. I have no complaints, which I know is unpopular these days. Now with that out of the way...\n\nREVIEW:\n\nThis is a wonderful, magical movie. My Neighbor Totoro (MNT) shows life in Japan in the 1950's from the perspective of 2 likable sisters, ages 10 and 4. Their Mother is in the hospital, and the whole family harbor silent fears that they'll lose her, so they show those fears in different ways. The portrayal of this family is believable, and multi-dimentional.\n\nThe magical element to this film is added when forest spirits (soot sprites, Totoro and his family) are discovered by the girls. What amazed me the most about this movie is it's portrayal of magic: How 'un-Disney"" it is. There's no Pixie Dust, no chimes playing on the soundtrack, only a display of wonder or awe in the faces of Satsuki (the older sister) and Mei (the younger one) when they see something that's fantastical.\n\nIn addidtion, the timing of the magic is: Few and Far Between. While that may seem like the scenes without magic would be boring, it only serves to heighten the girls' (and the audience's) wonder and excitment when magic does occur. It is similar in pace to Kiki's Delivery Service.\n\nI give this film my highest recommendation.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThis movie is rated G, but American audiences will be surprised to see the family bathing (yes, nude) together. It's a completely innocuous scene, done with an eye to authenticity in Japanese family life in the 1950's.";A wonderful, magical, movie
66;180.0;5.0;5.0;"My Neighbor Totoro (animation, adventure, family)\nDirected by Hayao Miyazaki\nStarring the voices of Dakota Fanning, Elle Fanning, Tim Daly and Pat Carroll\n\nDisney / Buena Vista | 1988 | 86 min | Rated G | Released Mar 02, 2010\n\nThe Film 5/5\n\nUnlike most of my previous reviews, My Neighbor Totoro hasn't yet been released on Blu-ray. Disney is working its way through the Studio Ghibli titles and has released most of them on DVD, but a Blu-ray release for this particular film is likely one or two years away. While I intend to own them all on the best possible format, I just had to buy Totoro on DVD until it sees a high definition release.\n\nThis is going to be a difficult review because my love for Studio Ghibli and its worlds is hard to put into words. I'll do my best.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's films aren't for everyone. They should be, but it just isn't the case. The reason is that we in North America have come to expect a certain style when it comes to animation.\n\nAnimated movies are typically fast-paced and filled with action. They have heroes, villains, chase scenes and conflict. What's more, they are noisy. It seems that without constant action, there's a fear that the audience might become bored. This is not a criticism, merely an observation. I'm quite happy watching such things as Kung Fu Panda, Megamind, Tangled or How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nMiyazaki's films don't follow the typical Hollywood style. Until very recently, everything was hand-drawn. Each frame is like a watercolor painting and has a certain beauty. Those who only watch modern CGI animation may not appreciate the classic two-dimensional style.\n\nAnother huge difference is the pacing. Instead of constant action, you'll see occasional shots of the countryside, a stream, an animal or clouds. It's a cultural difference and reflects a society in which people are more in tune with nature and the simple joy of being alive. Miyazaki's stories unfold gradually in their own time.\n\nLike most Studio Ghibli releases, Totoro doesn't contain any villains. We are shown situations that its characters encounter and have to figure out. It works because the characters are well-defined and we care about them. We want to see how they will proceed and whether they will succeed.\n\nThe story is set in the 1950s in a Japanese village and begins with Professor Kusakabe (Daly) arriving at his new house, along with daughters Satsuki and Mei (Dakota and Elle Fanning). Satsuki is about 10 years old and Mei around 4. The sisters are delighted with their new home. Mei mimics her sister's actions and sometimes repeats what she says. I have never seen a more realistic depiction of how children think and behave.\n\nThe children are full of life and explore their new house with excitement. It's rumored to be haunted, but they only encounter soot sprites which leave at the sound of laughter. The sprites are only visible to children. Another cultural difference is highlighted when the professor shares a bath with his daughters. His girls happily help with the chores before they run off to play. This is a world in which TV doesn't exist. The children spend their free time playing outside.\n\nProfessor Kusakabe puts the girls on his bicycle and takes them to a hospital where their mother is being treated. Miyazaki's own mother suffered from tuberculosis and, although it's never stated, this is probably what Mrs. Kusakabe was recovering from. It's not typical for animated films to deal with such themes as illness, but this is a realistic world and the situation fits. They learn that she's almost ready to return home and see their new house.\n\nSatsuki cooks for the family and her father works at home when he's not lecturing at the university. It's a benign world where children walk to school without any fear of abduction or similar dangers.\n\nMei isn't yet old enough for school and plays outside while her father works at his desk. She views the world with the charming fascination of a child, exploring her surroundings and watching tadpoles swim in the stream. Then she sees a pair of white ears in the long grass, belonging to a creature resembling a rabbit. The creature scurries away from her alternating between visible and invisible. She tracks it into a tunnel formed by overhanging trees. After entering a hole in the trunk of a vast tree she emerges in a clearing occupied by a giant sleeping creature.\n\nWe are more than 30 minutes into the film before she encounters the sleeping totoro. The film takes its time and doesn't feel the need to introduce the creature from the start. It looks like a cross between a cat, a teddy bear and an owl. She prods it inquisitively and it seems unconcerned by her presence. There's no sense of danger and she simply curls up on top of it and falls asleep. Her father and sister notice she is missing and set out to find her. When they arrive, she's sleeping on the ground in the forest with no sign of the totoro.\n\nWhen she tells her unlikely story, her father and sister believe her. They accept that she wouldn't lie. It's very refreshing to see that kind of trust between adult and child. Professor Kusakabe speculates that the totoro can only be seen when he wants to be seen and that Mei was very lucky to have the chance. These simple words make her happy.\n\nThe film defies our expectations at every turn. When her father has to go to the university, Mei starts to miss Satsuki, so the old woman looking after her takes her to the school. Satsuki explains to the teacher that their father will be home in a couple of hours and Mei is allowed to stay with the older children. She feels important and quietly sits at her desk drawing a picture of the totoro.\n\nI don't want to give away the whole story, but the totoro has an important part to play in the lives of the girls. The most worrying part of the film lasts about ten minutes, but it's a realistic situation and doesn't contain any villains. Their friend the totoro is a reassuring presence and knows how to solve the problem.\n\nThe girls are very sweet, but it isn't overdone. Little Mei is probably my favorite character in any animated film. She's thoroughly adorable. Miyazaki's drawings are quite simple, but he can convey emotion with just a few expressions. He varies the size of the children's mouths and eyes according to the mood of the scene.\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro is set in a world that no longer exists. The parents care deeply for their children and the two sisters love and depend on each other. Villagers pull together in times of crisis and care about their neighbors. Children respect older people and there's no sense of danger. It's a warm and happy place to visit and I wish the real world were more like Miyazaki's imaginary ones. This is what human beings are supposed to be like.\n\nMiyazaki has a wonderful imagination and it's even more prominent in fantasy worlds such as those encountered in Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky and the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. All of his stories have warmth and heart. If you see him interviewed, it's apparent that he loves what he does. His enthusiasm is infectious and he smiles when he talks about his worlds. He sees things that most of us take for granted and miss altogether.\n\nI consider My Neighbor Totoro to be the perfect family film. It may also be the happiest film I've ever seen and the relationship between the sisters is wonderful to watch. They aren't constantly bickering. If Mei gets tired, Satsuki carries her. Adults treat children seriously and genuinely want to know what's important to them. In today's world, with the pressures adults place on themselves, that isn't always the case.\n\nMiyazaki has crafted a film filled with wonder and a sense of discovery. It's like returning to your childhood and seeing the world from that perspective. The expressions of concentration, determination and pure wonder on Mei's face are depicted perfectly. The film is full of beauty. I don't just mean the animation - although it is beautiful - I'm also referring to the actions performed by the people and creatures in the film.\n\nThe feelings created by the story are considerably enhanced by Joe Hisaishi's haunting score. He's responsible for the music in all of Miyazaki's films and the two have established a good understanding. The melodies seem so simple, but it's hard to imagine the film without their presence.\n\nWhile I'm delighted that Disney is releasing the Studio Ghibli titles on Blu-ray, it can't happen fast enough. Some will argue that the English dub of the film ruins the experience. The good thing about the recent releases is that the original Japanese version is included as an option. If you want to experience the film in its native language, you can now do so, with or without subtitles.\n\nThere's also a short film set in the same world; Mei and the Kittenbus. It hasn't been released commercially, but is sometimes shown at the Studio Ghibli museum in Mitaka, Japan. You'll have to reserve a ticket in advance if you want to pay a visit. It's a long trip to see a 14-minute short film, but it's currently the only way to see it. My forlorn hope is to see the short included among the special features when the film is released on Blu-ray.\n\nI would recommend Miyazaki's films to everyone, although I realize that some people won't connect with them. The potential reward is worth the time investment. If you have children, there's even more reason to give one a try. Try to go in with an open mind. My Neighbor Totoro isn't about constant action or conflict, but it's an experience that shouldn't be missed. It's closer to a film like Bambi than Megamind or Despicable Me.\n\nJust because a film is about young children, it doesn't mean that the viewer has to be a young child in order to appreciate the story. Pixar has elevated North American films to new levels over the past two decades, but I can honestly say that Studio Ghibli, and Miyazaki in particular, has produced films with more heart. They are beautiful, magical and full of imagination. These stories matter to me and I can't wait to see the next one.";He's come to deliver what you've lost

Mayazakis' attention to detail (Notice the bottle under the house with the marble stopper in it for instance) as well as the way he conveys the feeling of a hot, summer day, a late afternoon thunderstorm or a sultry full moon night, is artfully and effectively accomplished. And there's no extraneous fillers or wasted moments. This movie remains not only of my daughters favorites but their dads' as well. I'm guessing that it's resurgence in popularity indicates a re-release perhaps? or perhaps a marketing ploy...(I'd heard somewhere that Disney bought the rights. Don't know  if that's true or not)...

Since the film came out back in the 1980's, it is really nice to get a fresh perspective from the creator and his team.\nIt is a simple, innocent story of a family during (allegedly) the 1950's in Japan. Mom is sick, and in essentially a quarantine/isolated hospital unit.\nHer husband and two daughters move out to the country to live near her while she recovers. The father is a professor at the local University, and very preoccupied with his studies and, quite obviously, his ill wife.\nThe film is a fantastic story of the sisters discovery of their neighbor 'Totoro', a big furry awesome character that lives 'next door'.\nThey have some great moments and some tremendous adventures. The true story is really about the daughters dealing with the uncertainty of their mothers condition, moving to a new town and dealing with a new school all the while discovering new friendships and dealing with hardship simultaneously. It does a great job of showing just how creative kids are, and also makes you think twice about your own inability to believe in the fantastic as an adult. It perfectly captures the transitional period between being an innocent child and the wonderful discovery of a world that is much more than you ever imagined.\nThe english Voice Overs by the Fanning sisters is superb. The rest of the english cast does a bang-up job as well. Some of the very non-western ideas sound a bit funny coming out of two kids speaking english, but it's not a distraction. It's great front to back, and the extra features were a treat to watch. I'm a fan of Hayao Miyazaki without question, but even a casual viewer will love this film. Do the kids a favor and pick this up. Do yourself a favor and watch it after the kids go to bed and be transported back in time to when you were in that same impressionable time.\n\nNow, while the box may LOOK like a Blu-ray movie, it is not.

Even if you can't speak japanese, A- it's possible to buy fandubs, and B- it's possible to find translated scripts on the internet. You're not getting the full experience of this movie if you watch a version in which they remove and replace ALL the sound... just realize that, please. I'm not even going to BRING UP the topic of the music....;You people are kidding, right???
69;188.0;1.0;5.0;If you are getting this as a sense of childhood nostalgia DON'T. The translation sucks and in this version they are not called dust bunnies. It made me sad the entire movie. You are better off getting it on VHS and burning a DVD copy.;Lost in Translation
187;189.0;4.0;7.0;"Miyazaki-sama! There just aren't the words to convey how much respect I have for this man's work, and the rest of the folks at Studio Ghibli as well.\n\n""Totoro"" is the story of two girls, whose father relocated them to the countryside to be near an ailing mother who must stay at the hospital. As will most of Miyazaki's film, ""Totoro"" dances lovingly around the edges of fantasy and reality, as the two sisters develop a friendship with the other-worldly creatures who live nearby.\n\nThe story to this film is just so sweet. I babysit for the 2 year old daughter of my best friend, and when it's raining outside, or the world has us a little blue, ""Totoro"" is a movie we both enjoy. Great in its own right, there's NOTHING like watching the face of a young child light up when the cat bus appears.\n\nThe DVD - unfortunately - is of inferior quality. There is apparently no widescreen version, no choice of Japanese with sub-titles (which is how I prefer to watch Japanese films, as with all releases in other languages). There are no extras, but extras aren't usually my selling point.\n\nI highly recommend this movie - as well as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" - to parents who are looking for something beyond ""Bob the Builder"" to share with their children. Utterly beautiful, this movie is obviously crafted with love.";A Very Sweet Story
98;190.0;1.0;6.0;I am a fan of the old 1988 version with the original english dubbing, so if you saw and enjoyed that version (the VHS version) you will be severely disappointed.  They change much of the dialogue and the pronunciation of names and it is just ridiculous.  Highly disappointed.  The voices barely match the lips and the dialogue is so dumbed down it is hard to follow the story.  If you are a Totoro fan and want the original english dubbed version, I suggest you look more closely before purchasing the DVD.;Dakota and Elle Fanning?
195;191.0;2.0;7.0;Ok, I'm a Miyazaki fan, we all know this movie is a masterpiece so there's no reason to bring that up. The movie easily gets 5 stars. The main concern here is the DVD. 20th Century Fox had very little to work with when they did this DVD. For those who don't already know, Disney has owned all of Studio Ghibli's movies since 1996. This includes My Neighbor Totoro in widescreen, Japanese, and anything they could hope to call an extra. That's why Disney is redubbing the movie and that's why this DVD has almost nothing on it and why they couldn't even remaster it. They worked with what they had and did the best they could. Of course, when Disney releases their version, it will have many more features(thought I don't think they will ever top this flawless dub unless they work their magic like they did with Spirited Away.);The Reason for the Poor Packaging
198;192.0;2.0;7.0;"This film is one of my personal favorites. It is far above being an average kids movie. It is wonderful as a children's movie; it is a charming and clever work of art enjoyed by adults as well. It is also a favorite among the many fans of its creator, Academy Award winner Hayao Miyazaki.\nSuch a shame, then, to see the DVD presented so poorly, in TV aspect ratio and in English only. The Region 2 version of this DVD is much nicer, offering widescreen format, multiple language selections, subtitles, and extras including a map to the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Why, then, must we in Region 1 settle for such a lazy, lousy package? Why bother with the DVD? This is like having a videocassette.\nIf you just want something to pop in to keep the young kids out of trouble, you can't go wrong with this fascinating, magical yarn. If you are a film lover, DVD collector, or if you are looking to pad your experiences with the art of Hayao Miyazaki, I reccomend considering the fact that there are alternatives to this poor treatment, such as the Region 2 version.";Poor packaging of a wonderful film
105;193.0;1.0;6.0;"I bought the DVD version for my dad for christmas. This has been our entire family's favorite movie ever. As soon as the new song with different voices came on were all devastated.\n\nI'm not exaggerating; we stopped it immediately. I was so upset and disappointed that they messed with such a great movie. My Neighbor Totoro is well worth the money/time to see it. But see the original (english version). I'm sorry Dakota; it's not personal against you... but bad choice to re-do it at all.\n\nIf you've seen the original one you'd understand... my movie! what happened to my movie!! :'(";Why ruin it?
75;194.0;5.0;5.0;Totoro is one of the best animated films for not just kids, but kids-at-heart.  If you haven't seen it, you are doing yourself a disservice.  Don't do that.;Totoro is.
78;195.0;5.0;5.0;"I wanted to share my love of Miyazaki's animated features with my 5-year-old, but I wanted to make sure it would be appropriate for her. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" proved to be delightful and engaging, perfect for a young child.\n\nThe story is simple and sweet without being overly cloying. A father and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei move to the countryside whilst their mother recovers from an illness in the hospital. There, the sisters discover that their home is haunted by benign spirits and the younger sister Mei discovers a creature named Totoro which is a forest spirit (he looks like an oversized bunny). Totoro is a sight to behold - his large appearance and loud growls belie a gentle nature, one which is in harmony with Mother Nature. One night, as the sisters wait for their father at the bus-stop, older sister Satsuki finds Totoro standing beside her in the rain. The sisters then witness an unusual sight - a cat which is also a bus, which looks like it was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat!\n\nThere are no villains in this charming and engaging story, and I found that quite refreshing (why should there be villains in children's stories, they'll learn the harsh realities of life soon enough!).  Even the mother's illness is vague and not a real cause for concern except perhaps in the later part of the story when Mei goes missing trying to find the hospital her mother is in. My daughter could not get enough of Totoro and begged for repeated viewings. She loves the giant, endearing creature and would watch with rapt fascination each time Totoro appeared on screen.\n\nI loved the gentle ecological message of being in harmony with nature - Totoro bequests a gift of  seeds to the sisters which they plant in their garden. This is a sweet movie perfect for little ones and also older viewers - a show that can be enjoyed by the entire family.";Possibly the sweetest of Miyazaki's films
112;196.0;5.0;6.0;Wonderful film. I'm a fan of many Studio Ghibli films, even the darker ones for older audiences, but this one is pure joy that's appropriate for even quite young kids. The Cat Bus is absolutely great, and Totoro's pretty cool too. I don't know about the differences between the Disney and the Fox version in terms of the dubbing - which some reviewers seem so well versed and opinionated about - but don't let those concerns stop you from seeing this film. It's great.;Great.
201;197.0;3.0;7.0;Yes, I agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that I think the movie itself is practically perfect, filled with beauty, joy, wonder and hope.  However, the DVD was indeed put together very poorly.  The extras were only previews of old children's movies (one of them from when I was a kid 20 years ago).  I would have liked a widescreen option and also the option to view it in the original Japanese with English subtitles, not to mention any possible extras, about the movie, in English.  I think it was still worth buying and I would buy a better DVD again if it existed.  Also, my nearly three year old daughter loves this movie as much as I do and watches it over and over with great enthusiasm.;Wonderful Movie, Crummy DVD
203;198.0;5.0;7.0;"I remember seeing this back in '95, and after picking up the video just recently, this small wave of nostalgia ran over me.\nMy Neighbor Totoro, directed by one of THE greatest animators of all time, has touched the hearts of millions. Hayao Miyazaki did a superb job when he adapted this movie from the children's book of the same name. Though the book only had one girl, Hayao decided to metaphorically 'split her in two' and created an older sister, Setsuki, and a younger sister, Mei, for the anime.\n And it worked pretty well. Totoro is quite the strange looking creature; he's large, has a big goofy grin on his face(which can only be matched by Gengar's) throughout most of the movie, he can fly, AND he's friends with a freakish looking bus called the Cat Bus. While it all sounds very childish, anyone who ever was a child can enjoy this movie. My Neighbor Totoro NEVER makes the adults look like the 'bad parents' that we see far too often in most american children's films. In fact, the father even tells his two daughters that he believes that what they say about Totoro is true. Even the slightly-scary looking Nanny turned out to be the one of the friendliest persons in the movie. Plus, the animation is AWESOME, especially for a film that came out in the late 80's. Even today Totoro's animation rivals the best animes'.\nHighly recommended for those with an open mind.";One of the first, and best, anime I've ever seen!
117;199.0;5.0;6.0;A marvelous, wonderful film.  Soundtrack, cinematography, everything.  Just so folks know, the setting is early 1950s Japan, before the old landscape was destroyed to make way for urbanity, which was the calculated solution for the political turmoil.  This was also a time in Japan when the incidence of tuberculosis was increasing dangerously.  Miyazaki's mom was in the hospital with TB, so this film is slightly autobiographical.  But the world it depicts is, sadly, mostly gone -- gone with Totoro's wind.;Gone with the wind
211;200.0;1.0;7.0;This is a great movie like all Gibli anime filmes, perfect for both child and adult alike. What I can't understand is why there is no Japanese on the DVD. All the Japanese released Gibli movies have both along with lots of extra stuff like original drawings and documentaries. As long as you have subtitles the original Japanese is much better and fits in with Gibli's characters better than the English. Of course it is good to have the dubbed version for kids. I think Disney have got this totally wrong. What is more annoying is that there is no product information with the ... write up that tells you this. Buyers should know they are not getting the original version.;Where are the product details ...
85;201.0;5.0;5.0;"Nobody captures the magic of childhood and bottles it into movie form quite like Hayao Miyazaki -- and one steller example of this is ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" an enchanting little film about two little girls who encounter strange, wondrous things in the woods. There's not much actual plot, but the journey is the truly lovely part, and the lush animation and weird creatures (catbus! CATBUS!) finish off the perfection.\n\nSatsuki and her toddler sister Mei move to the countryside with their father, so they can be close to the hospital where their mother is being treated (apparently for tuberculosis). The girls are immediately taken under the wing of an old lady, and discover that the countryside is filled with strange and magical creatures -- especially little balls of soot that dance through uncleaned rooms in their house.\n\nWhat's more, while waiting for a bus Satsuki ends up standing next to a giant grinning bunny-creature -- whom Mei learns is called Totoro -- who boards a giant leaping cat-bus. The girls soon befriend the trio of Totoro, who take them on magical adventures involving giant fast-growing trees, flying with umbrellas, and riding in the cat-bus. But after the girls learn that their mother has become ill and can't visit, Mei vanishes without a trace -- and Satsuki may need Totoro's help to find her.\n\n""My Neighbor Totoro"" is sort of a fantasy slice-of-life story -- it's basically a few days in the life of two chipper little girls, who happen to be living in a Japanese countryside filled with genial spirits and magical happenings. There's no real plot at the center of it, but such is Miyazaki's skill that you never really care. You just want to see if things will turn out all right in the short term, and revel in the innocence of being little kids in the countryside.\n\nTo that end, Miyazaki spins up a magical little world -- houses are filled with bug-eyed sootballs, a tunnel in the bushes may lead to a Totoro's lair, and a vegetable garden can sprout into a vast towering tree. It's all painted in lush, vibrant colors and great detail, and Miyazaki does a good job emphasizing the little moments of everyday life (Mei showing up at Satsuki's school) and interweaving them with the more fantastical stuff (Totoro flying across windswept fields with an umbrella).\n\nBut he never forgets that real life has its bumps in the road -- there's a genuinely touching subplot in which the girls hear that their mother is ill again, and there's a genuine sense of fear. It's not too harsh (it's a kid's movie, after all), but it taps into a very primal fear that every little kid has.\n\nThe characters are all rather simple, but they're still quite likable, with upbeat personalities and loud laughter. Satsuki is particular is a realistic kid, staying positive most of the time but occasionally blowing up at Mei or crying out of fear that her mother will die. The only character I didn't understand was the boy in the cap, who seems troubled and shy, but who is never fully explored.\n\nWhile it's more obviously aimed at kids than many of Miyazaki's movies, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is an enchanting little story with a warm heart, and Hayao Miyazaki perfectly captures the innocence of childhood. Plus, it has a big, furry, grinning bus.";Spirits of the forest
132;202.0;5.0;6.0;"A lot of times whenever I see the words ""family film"", it usually means that the film is perfect for kids but adults would merely find it tolerable, as if it's not that entertaining but it's not a bore either. Recently my sister had a kid's show on TV that she loves yet I felt kind of ""meh"" about it. Well Miyazaki films are perfect since they're colorful and imaginative for the kids but they're quite entertaining for the adults too.\n\nSatsuki and Mei are 2 girls who have just moved into a new house with their dad. Mei takes a trip to the nearby forest and runs into a Totoro, a forest spirit who resembles a giant rabbit. Soon Satsuki also finds it and the 2 have fun with it. Only thing is is that their mom is in the hospital and Mei does something drastic to go see her.\n\nWatching Totoro, you get the sense of you're watching something that fits perfectly with whatever situation you're in. If you're a parent with kids it's perfect but if you're just buying it to watch it that'll work too. Unlike Nausicaa or Mononoke which were maybe a bit too ""adult"", Totoro fits for everyone who just wants to be entertained for an hour and a half.\n\nIt's certainly an imaginative film but it doesn't have that out-there craziness like other films had. There's no guy with a pig head or giant....bug things or a giant talking wolf. It does have one very odd addition: a bus shaped like a multi-legged cat. But the imagination in a way seems a bit more tamer. In fact, Totoro doesn't show up right away, neither does the Cat Bus and they're not in the movie that much anyway. One thing is that kids might be slightly turned off by the fact that it's not one of those ""everything's perfect"" kid films where the only badness comes from the bad guy. There's no song singing and when Totoro isn't smiling(kind of creepily I might add), he's roaring like crazy.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch the japanese version. It reeks of stunt-casting syndrome that animated films have been doing lately which is to just cast a big star for whatever role you feel like instead of matching the character to the voice(the only 3 I ever liked were Patrick Stewart and Alison Lohman in Nausicaa and Christian Bale). The extras are kind of disappointing since being a 2-disc set you're expecting some huge ensemble of documentaries but there's not a whole lot here.\n\nIs it watchable? Definately. Whether or not your kids will love it though depends on what they like. If they prefer big rousing songs and endless comic relief...they might not like it. Imagination and colorful animation? Then they will.";A family film that's not just for the kids
136;203.0;5.0;6.0;I see a lot of people complaining about the dub of this film, but quite honestly I couldn't tell you anything about that?  Why, well because I can't see anything topping the original Japanese voices.\n\nFirst of all, we have Shigesato Itoi.  If you know that name, then you are my best friend, because you probably recognize him as the genius behind Mother, Mother 2 (EarthBound), and Mother 3, the absolutely legendary RPG's.  He was the voice of the girls' father, and quite honestly I can't see anyone doing a better job.  He alone makes the original version superior in my opinion.\n\nWhile I realize that Miyazaki wishes that people might watch his movies in their own language so that they might spend their time looking at the art work rather than the subtitles, but honestly, I  still prefer the Japanese.\n\nNow wile I do prefer subs, I'm not entirely biased, for example, I think that Spirited Away and Monoke Hime have very very well done dubs, but I still believe that subs are generally the way to go.\n\nSo in the end, it's a fantastic movie, with a fantastic Japanese language track.  If you really want a good English dub, then I would recommend you trust the other reviews, but if you want to see the movie the way it was written, the way it was intended, the better way, I would have to recommend sticking with this one.;Dub What?
140;204.0;1.0;6.0;My daughter and I both hated the re-dubbed version of this film.

I'm not sure if I wanted to cry or puke when I started to play this...\n\nTrue Totoro fans should steer clear of this Disney make-over mess. It is the biggest video disappointment of the new millenium for me. Shoot, back to the old VHS.;What a disappointment...
156;206.0;5.0;6.0;Please ignore the review above that says this DVD is bad - this review refers to an earlier editon of the DVD, not the grand-spanking new Disney version.\n\nDisney has started to do unbelievably good dubs of Miyazaki's DVDs, and this one is one of the best.  The two little girls on this disc are voiced by Dakota Fanning and her little sister Elle Fanning, and both of them do a bang-up job.  When Elle cries, you will cry.  Their father is also well cast, as Tim Daly, voice of Superman on Justice League.  Usually with anime, I listen to the Japanese tracks, but with these new dubs, even Miyazaki agrees that the voices are sometimes better.\n\nThe quality of the video is also outstanding.  Disney has given the same treatment to Miyazaki's movies that it gave to its own classics like Aladdin and Lion King.  Bold colors, perfect compression, and great sound.\n\nAnd it goes without saying that this movie has a great story.  It is touted as one of the most beloved family movies of all time, and I have to agree.;Perfect movie, great disc
230;207.0;5.0;7.0;"Since the first theatrical release in Japan, I have been a devoted fan of this film, and Totoro and two sisters' wonderful, magical, fascinating tale in rural Japan is my all-time best.\nAnd if you think this film is just for kids only, trust me, it is not.  Now I'm a grown-up, but still can enjoy watching it.  Two lovable sisters are always well-drawn and credible while three furry monsters ""Totoro""s (lovely creatures, indeed) are nothing but charming.  And these things many fans have said rightly.  Now I could add some reasons for the enormous popularity, especially popularity in Japan.\nAs you know after watching the opening scenes, this animation uses the countryside of Japan as its background.  Sadly, these beautiful country is now becoming a past memory even for Japanese people.  We no longer see conducters (guides) on local bus service; no good old three-wheeled trucks can be seen (on which sisters' father was seen), and school buildings are modernized so little chance for you to see Satsuki's school in reality.  These facts, beside its good story telling, make the film all the more charming for us, Japanese.\nOn top of that, many adult viewers surely remember the way they acted like spies when they were kids; made their own story of adventure, fought against imaginary creatures, and so on.  Yes, we see even our autobiography in it sometimes.  Have you ever experienced a childlike. thrilling sensation of finding a hidden passage in a house where you newly moved?  Have you lost your way amid the places you had never been, and felt scared of the coming sunset as a child?  I have, and all those memories would spring back to my mind vividly while watching ""Totoro.""\nOf course, kids enjoy this film, but it is something more as director Hayao Miyazaki's films always are.  Creatures are cute, 12-legged cat-bus is infallably the favorite and wonder for kids, and three ""Totoro""s always steal your eyes.  Now remember, ""Totoro"" is much more than that.  Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults.  Definitely.\nBy the way, something about sisters' names.  ""Satsuki"" is the old, elegant way of calling the fifth month of the year; hence, meanig ""May.""  So, the sisters' names mean virtually the same thing, the best time of year of Japan.";Loved by Many Fans in Japan and the Whole World
175;208.0;3.0;6.0;The Movie is a five-star masterpeice that must be seen by anyone who can. There is no better living Film director than Miyazaki and with every feature it grows truer and truer. Totoro is a wonderful film the whole family can enjoy and it has the incredible ability to lift spirits at all times.\n\nThe Fox edition of this DVD is shabby and worthless. There are no special features, it's in Full Screen (which is not it's original theatrical aspect ratio), and the english dub A. Blows and B. Is the only available viewing option. This is a travesty and a diservice to this great film. Fear not however because Disney is releasing a new two-disc special edition in the same veign as Porco Rosso, The Cat Returns and Nausicaa.\n\nIf you can't wait to get your Totoro fix then i reluctantly recommend this DVD, but it's not a fair representation of this beautiful film. I bought it for five dollars at borders (After I used a coupon that gave me 25% of the purchase.) Other than that sort of circumstance do not buy this DVD...especially not so close to the Disney release (They did a spectacular job with the afformentioned films and Spirited Away..hopefully they will be re-dubbing Totoro with better actors.);Wonderful movie...horrid DVD

I have it on VHS and it is one of the most enjoyable, beautifully painted and almost meditative films I have ever seen.  Then, I was quite angry when I got Totoro home to find it is stupid full frame rather than letterboxed!  Trust me, you do not want to miss any of the backgrounds in any of Hayao Miyazaki's films.  This is why just 4 stars and not 5! This film is slow in pace, not for sugar-enhanced kids (or parents who need angry robots fighting in space.  This is like looking up at the trees and clouds from a hammock on a warm summer's day.  Tired of there being a lack of positive strong young girl characters in film?  Hayao Miyazaki seems to have a father's love of them.  When a film comes from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, it has nearly a 98% chance of being spectacular and wholly unique.  Each of his films has a warmth, passion and innocence that seems to be completely lost in films found in the US mainstream cinema.  Spirited Away or any other of Hayao Miyazaki's films, could never have been made in the US.  I can hear the Hollywood execs saying this about My Neighbor Totoro, ""Let me get this straight, two young girls meet a enormous friendly fuzzy ghost thingy with fangs and claws?  Then they get magic acorns and there is a bus that really is a cat with lots of legs?  Sounds like your client needs a twelve-step plan.  Here's where I went.""  I seriously doubt that you could meet someone from Japan who doesn't know or maybe collect something from one of Studio Ghibli's films";One of the greatest Animation films ever
96;212.0;5.0;5.0;"My opinion only, but fans of animation must bow down to Hayao Miyazaki. In fact, fans of movies, in general, and of art must give Mr. Miyazaki his due propers. I've seen his recent stuff (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howl-s-Moving-Castle/dp/B000CDGVOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howl's Moving Castle</a>) and am left awestruck. The man is a genius in his purview, and he works hard. Simply remarkable, the craftsmanship and soul and depth fused into these pictures. Having fanned myself into an addiction for more of Mr. Miyazaki's works, I've started to backtrack and catch up on his older films. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, released in 1988, was my intro to his more classic stuff. Not too surprisingly, I really enjoyed it.\n\nMost folks consider MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO (or TONARI NO TOTORO) to be a masterpiece, and who am I to argue? Set on a more intimate scale than Mr. Miyazaki's other, more grandiose efforts, it's one of the best family films around, particularly in terms of portraying the family interrelationships. The way in which the two young girls connect to each other is disarming and a sheer pleasure to watch. Too, I like that their father isn't an absent parent by default, or one who's too busy or prone to misunderstanding and distrusting his kids (like in most American family films). When the youngest girl, Mei, tells her father (and her older sister) that she'd just encountered a ""totoro"" he doesn't dismiss her out of hand. He listens and even ventures an explanation. And it doesn't come off as condescending. In fact, the same thing happens earlier in the film, when the family was just moving into their new home and the girls glimpse the soot sprites. Dude's a cool dad.\n\nThe plot, real quick: Two young girls (with their dad) move to rural Japan to be closer to their ailing mother, who temporarily resides in a nearby hospital. Along the way, the girls - the pre-teen Satsuki and her four-year-old sister Mei - meet Totoro, a large but benign forest spirit, whom only children can see. Totoro would become their friend and guardian.\n\nThis is a rare film in that it contains neither villains nor violence. Mr. Miyazaki renders his supernatural world so benevolent and wondrous that it elicits delighted smiles, and not shudders. The scary moments instead stem from the girls' overriding fear that their sickly mother might not get better, that she might even die, a truly frightening prospect for children. And, because of Mr. Miyazaki's attention to detail and development of his characters, this concern becomes valid to us. You ache for the girls. Real people, real concerns.\n\nVisually, technically, emotionally, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a beautiful film. No surprise then that Hayao Miyazaki writes, directs, and draws this thing. There's an enchanting simplicity here, with a leisurely pace and a narrative which isn't rushed. Again, respect to Mr. Miyazaki's attention to detail. We learn much of the Japanese culture; specifically, we gain an insight into Japan's agricultural way of life and the farmers' affinity with their environment. As usual, Mr. Miyazaki injects his cast with an appreciation and respect for nature. And nature reciprocates in the form of the forest spirit Totoro, whose simple pleasures are sights to behold, from his lazy enjoyment of an afternoon nap to his infectious glee at the raindrops pelting his umbrella.\n\nThere's a joy in the sisters' interactions with Totoro.  There's something quite moving about this mysterious creature guiding the girls in a mystical rite to make their slow-growing acorns shoot up into mature oak trees. And there's something so right about Satsuki and Mei waking up later to realize that their planted seeds hadn't grown to full bloom after all, but that they did, however, finally begin to sprout. And, when, earlier, Totoro soared the night skies on his magical top, with the children and the little totoros crazily clinging to him, what a truly glorious and uplifting moment.\n\nA bit now on the dvd special features (from the Disney presentation). Disc 1 not only has the movie but also the following: ""Behind the Microphone"" - a segment featuring the English voiceover actors (Dakota and Elle Fanning are a delight); the Opening & Ending Title Sequence Art; and the original trailer. Meanwhile, Disc 2, if you have it, offers the original Japanese storyboards for the entire film.\n\nIf there's one truly melancholy note here, it's in the thought that there'll come a day when Satsuki and Mei won't be able to see Totoro anymore. But, at least, in 2002, Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli came out with MEI AND THE KITTENBUS, a 13-minute-long follow up to MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO which demonstrates that at least Mei hasn't been deprived of hanging out with otherworldy company. Now if only Studio Ghibli will let us see the damn thing.\n\nAs ever, Mr. Miyazaki's humanity and perceptiveness shine thru. And this I can't emphasize enough: The film has appealing magical creatures, yes. And the film presents several stunning magical sequences, sure. But the true magic lies in the sisters and how they relate to each other, and sometimes get annoyed with each other, yet continually care for each other. Satsuki and Mei are simply irresistible, wonderfully realized characters. The self-sufficiency and warmth of Satsuki. The cute stubbornness of Mei (maybe an ear of corn CAN cure maladies). Gentle and whimsical and enchanting, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is recommended for the young and the young-at-heart and even the cranky-at-heart. So get on board for this one. I'm certain that crazy, big-grinning Cat Bus has tons of room.\n\nNext on my to-watch list:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiki-s-Delivery-Service/dp/B00005JM2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Porco-Rosso/dp/B0001XAPY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Porco Rosso</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausicaa-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/dp/B0001XAPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B00005JKYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>.";MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO - The Bow Down to Hayao Miyazaki Edition
97;213.0;5.0;5.0;I just received my DVD this week, and am confused by all of the negative reviews regarding this version not having the original Japanese film with subtitles - this DVD HAS THIS VERSION!!! Of course it doesn't come set up to automatically play that version, because we ARE in the U.S. after all, and most folks want their animation in English... it's just a set up on the DVD.  It's not hard.  This particular version was released in 2006 - so for everyone who got the original DVD - get this one!!\n\nThat said, I *heart* Totoro.  I want him to live in the tree in my neighbor's yard. This film almost doesn't need the subtitles, the animation and emotion of the characters is so strong, it translates.  It's a tale of love and magic and nature and full of the wonderment of childhood.  The child in you (and your kids!) will love it!;THIS DVD HAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION!!!
99;214.0;2.0;5.0;"Let me start by saying my family loves this movie and our original VHS is very worn out. I was hoping to replace the tape with the Disney DVD release.  I was so disappointed.  They changed Satsuki's name - and pronounce it Satski - yuck!!  They added unnecessary dialogue - one of the things I love about the original is that it doesn't try to explain everything, it makes you think.  If you are trying to replace your old VHS - this is not the one to buy.  It's probably fine, for anyone who hasn't seen the original...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B0001XAQ0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>";Don't replace your old VHS with this Disney version...
206;215.0;3.0;6.0;"First of all, this is a great move; excellent story, expertly animated.  I just wish that the DVD was worthy of the movie.  Compared to other films of this calibre (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke) this DVD is just unacceptablly bare bones.";Great move, Bad DVD
104;216.0;1.0;5.0;"I grew up watching this movie in several formats. Starting with the original Japanese tapes followed by the American tapes and finally both versions of the American DVD. I loved them all until this one.\nwhat happened?!!! The first dub was amazing, full of genuine feelings and portrayals, with a very close translation! This new version is just trash in comparison. watch them side by side and you will see how much it's been ripped apart. The only reason I would buy this set would be for the Japanese version, I don't care how ""lively"" Dakota fanning and her sister are, they are not suited for this.\nIf you can find the original dub, buy it; it still has all the magic that makes this movie what it is. It's an amazing movie, just a terrible DVD.";what happened!?!
108;217.0;5.0;5.0;We watched this twice yesterday and I'm still tearing up just thinking about it. The animation, the music, the story and the direction are all so effortless and moving at the same time that I can't think of any other animation, ever, that's left me feeling so satisfied, inspired and happy. It's so original and good-spirited, the images are just beautiful, the story is absorbing and touching, and there's a wide streak of pure fun and joy like a big vein of gold through the whole thing. I just love this movie.;Thoroughly delightful, an absolute treasure
228;218.0;5.0;6.0;A friend highly recommended this movie to so I rented it one rainy afternoon. I was never a fan of animation, that is until I saw My Neighbor Tororo. This movie was wonderful! It's a touching tale of the friendship between two sister and a bunch of wonderful and friendly totoros. The soundtrack is fabulous and the animation/artwork is indescribable. I went out the next day and bought my own copy of this movie and became a collector of Totoro stuffed toys, posters, etc..., and also a great admirer of Hiyao Miyazaki. He is truly a master storyteller and Disney really needs to get it together and release his movies (I believe they bought the right for American distribution) and release his other masterpieces to the public. People of all ages will be captivated by this magical tale.;A Wonderful Movie for All!!!!
110;219.0;5.0;5.0;Buy it, buy it, buy it!  If you are keen to detail and your sense of humour is a bit off....you'll love this.  The creativity is amazing.....my teens still watch this over and over!;Another must have!
116;220.0;5.0;5.0;My two-year-old speaks Japanese and English. He absolutely loves this movie (watches it almost every day)!;Bilingual 2-year-old
119;221.0;5.0;5.0;My daughter loved the Fox version of Totoro and so that's the version that we tend to prefer (or expect since we've watched it 1000s of times it seems) so it was hard to really like this newer version... we still reach for the other version more often.  Having said that, it's still one of my favorite movies regardless of who's doing the voices :);Love the movie
122;222.0;5.0;5.0;I know it's silly, but I just can't help myself. I would have thought I would have gotten sick of this movie, but it stands up well after repeating viewings. I haven't tried the English language track as yet but I am use to watching it with subtitles and wouldn't want the characters to sound different. A double bill of this followed by Spirited Away would be an excellent rainy day activity. I want my Catbus!;I get teary every time!
123;223.0;5.0;5.0;Warm characters and imaginative creatures.  Every picture is detailed and unique in it's view.  Definitely entertaining because it's so different from other animation!;Fertile imagination
125;224.0;5.0;5.0;"Family movies don't get much better than this.  No double-entendres, no sex/violence, and yet most (mature) adults will find it most enjoyable.  Miyazaki's animation style is always a welcome touch.  There are Japanese cultural references so the uninitiated might be confused at times, however, the story transcends most boundaries and is simply a good ""friendly spirit"" movie.\n\nKids will enjoy Totoro and his friends as well as the fact that the children are the focus and stars of the movie.  Adults will find the family situations strikingly realistic and will easily identify with (and get a chuckle out of) several conversations between parents and their children.\n\nThis is one of those movies from which you will get the ""warm fuzzies.""  Share it with others in your family!";Charming family movie
129;225.0;5.0;5.0;this movie is one of the best ghibli creations. and contrary to others opinions i really think it can be loved by both children and adults, as with most great films. aside from the artwork which is beautiful, it is about childhood, family, and a respect for your surrondings. i think myazaki did a wonderful job of portraying this story and reminding us of what its like to be a kid.;BR
134;226.0;3.0;5.0;I first saw Totoro with the English subtitles in the what I now know is the Fox version about 8 years ago and loved it.  I was tired and saw the dvd on the shelf and got excited and didn't look closely.  At home I popped it in and the most appallingly crass sounding voice came out of Satsuki then Mei.  It's nice that I have now have the Japanese version, but my daughter doesn't understand Japanese.  I'm hunting down the Fox.;Well, Disney Screwed This Up
135;227.0;4.0;5.0;Totoro, in classic Miyazaki tradition, brings the fantastic into the realm of everyday occurrences. The underlying story is rather pedestrian: a Japanese father moves into the countryside with his two daughters, and they adjust to their new pastoral environment while waiting for the mother to be released from the hospital. We are not explained exactly why the mother is bedridden, but the ambiguity plays an effective role in keeping the dramatic tension taut throughout the film. However, the plot is driven mainly by the imagination of the two children whose experiences with the magical create the driving mechanism behind the film.\n\nWithout giving anything away, MY NEIGHBOR, TOTORO is a heartwarming film that inspires both the young and the old alike. Watching the film again several years after seeing it in the theaters, I realize that the story works NOT because it is about fantastic and magical characters but rather it involves everyday struggles. In TOTORO, we see Miyaki revisiting the same themes (i.e. familial harmony, nature, environmental awareness, courage, etc.) that he further develops in his later works. Nevertheless, the mastery and the imagination behind his craft keeps the story fresh.\n\nDespite what the Box Office report card may indicate for MY NEIGHBOR, TOTORO, this is a film sure to be a hit with the family.;A Hit for All Generations
137;228.0;3.0;5.0;This just shouldn't have happened. What were they thinking?\n\nFrankly, I didn't think the Fox English dub was perfect. The voice actors seemed a little too earnest. Let's just say I thought it lacked subtlety, but in what is basically a children's movie, this is quite forgivable.\n\nThe new Disney English cast changes the way we perceive the characters, and not for the better. It makes Totoro somehow darker. There are dialogue changes (compared to the Fox edition) which simply do not work for me, apart from issues with the voice acting itself.\n\nThe Disney version is still a charming movie, but the Fox version is more charming. The Fox dubbing makes it more sincere, in a way.;"a ""me too"" on the new dubbing -- a major disappointment"
150;229.0;5.0;5.0;"My 15 year old son has been an anime fan since he was small.  I always thought that it was kind of cute but slightly annoying.  As a huge fan of Turner Classic Movies, I saw there was to be a month of Miyazaki movies run.  I wasn't the least bit interested.  The night that ""My Neighbor Totorro"" was coming on, I just happened to have the t.v. on.  First, I heard the introduction by TCM host Ben Mankowitz (nephew of director Joseph L. Mankowitz).  I became intrigued and left the t.v. on.  My 11 year old son wandered into the room and sat down.  I sat down, followed by my 15 year old son and my ex-husband who happened to be visiting rounded out the group.  We were enchanted!!  After that we watched all the Miyazaki films for the rest of the month.  Since then, we have seen the previous English dubbed version and I didn't like it as much.  The Disney ""Americanized"" versions of Miyazaki's films may disgust anime purists but they open up the whole world of Miyazaki to people that otherwise might never give these films a second glance simply because they are ""foreign and strange"".  I think this reason alone would thrill Miyazaki!!  Bravo to Turner Classic Movies for sharing a new genre with us!!  Anime ""purists"" need to lighten up a little!!!";"Anime ""purists"" are snobs"
153;230.0;5.0;5.0;"Wow, there sure are a lot of people complaining about the new Disney dub on ""My Neighbor Totoro""!  Having seen both English dubbed versions, my feeling is the complete opposite.  I much prefer Disney's dub to the old Fox dub.  The reason for this is that it seemed that Fox (or whoever dubbed it for them) wasn't as concerned with authenticity.  The most glaring thing was the voice of Mei in the Fox dub.  It was done by the woman who voices Angelica Pickles in the Rugrats cartoon.  Now, I really don't like adults doing ""kid"" voices, and every time I heard Mei speak, I couldn't get the image of Angelica out of my head!  At least with the Disney dub, they got two real girls to voice the characters, and I thought Elle Fanning did a great job on Mei.  Ok, maybe a bit too ""screechy"", but still fairly believable as a four year old.  The only things about the Disney dub that I didn't like were the song changes, and the fact that they dubbed over Totoro and Catbus (why bother with non-talking creatures?).  However, I am still going to say that I prefer the Disney dub to the Fox dub.\n\nSo, for those of you out there who are trying to get an idea on whether to buy the new DVD or not, just use your own judgment, and don't pay so much attention to the complaints about the dub.  It's still a wonderful film.";English dub is subjective....
157;231.0;4.0;5.0;Finally the widescreen version is available.  I have my own previous dvd from FOX, 4:3 format.  But what disappointment when listening the English version, lack, poor, slow, no feeling.  Even the opening and ending theme are bad, extending some high voice notes.\n\nThe only good things for this dvd version are:\n\n16:9 format.\n\nThe soundtrack.\n\nOriginal Japanese language track.\n\nSubtitles (English and Japanese)\n\nFor Miyazaki collectors, this dvd must be on your own dvd library.\n\nStill the old dvd version is far better on English language track.\n\nAgain the Disney mafia destroyed the magic of this beautiful film.  My advice is to watch this movie on Japanese language and English subtitles.\n\nStudio Ghibli = A\n\nDisney = F;Better format and worst english translation
165;232.0;5.0;5.0;"I own the first English dubbed version, as well as the new version. I absolutely love this film. I recommend this to everone I know. If we had more gentle entertainment like this, we would be a much happier world. I have one negative about the newest version, the ""voice talents"". I find the new vesrsion of the whole audio track dull! I much prefer the old version of the voice and music. I do like the restored visuals. It has made a beutiful animation stunning!\n\nHighly recommend this one!";Wonderful animation

238;234.0;4.0;6.0;"While not as good, or complex as Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind or Princess Mononoke, this gentle fairy tale is still a beautiful.  It is  actually two story's in one.  The first is the fairy tale.  Two young girls  arrive in their new home, in the Japanese countryside and immediately find  that their home is ""haunted"" by Dust Bunnies and Totoro (a rabbit  like spirit that come in different sizes).  The second story involves the  children's mother, who is in the hospital with a mysterious disease  (Miyazaki later revealed in interviews that the children's mother had TB),  and how the children and their father deal with the sad situation.\nThe  two sisters are very real, Sasuke is the more responsible elder sister and  May is the younger 5 year old who seems wiser beyond her years.  The  dubbing is done with professional care and one of the best out there.  We  go with them, share their quirks (like yelling to scare away ghosts), find  exciting discoveries and meeting ""interesting"" characters (like  the 10 foot Chelshire Cat/Bus borrowed from Alice in Wonderland).  I loved  the ending and don't turn the tape off while the credits roll.  The still  pictures tell their own little story and are worth watching.\nRating: B+";My third favorite Hayao Miyazaki film.
239;235.0;5.0;6.0;"Having just watched Totoro for the first time, I'm an instant fan.  Between this and ""Princess Mononoke,"" I am coming to the understanding that Hayao Miyazaki is a major talent in animation -- a fact  others have known for years.\nI think no film, with the possible exception  of ""Wizard of Oz"" and parts of ""ET"", so effectively  captures the breathless excitement of childhood.  Watching  ""Totoro,"" I felt as though 10 years had been taken off my own  age.  One scene in particular -- the scene in the bus stop, in the rain --  is absolutely classic, and has quickly become one of my all-time  favorites.\nAn obvious theme in Miyazaki's work is a reverence for nature  bordering on worship.  But Miyazaki's nature is not a cuddly, huggable  world of wisecracking animal sidekicks -- it is big, and intimidating, and  sometimes frightening.  Totoro himself, though unquestionably cute, does  not mug for the camera.  He has his own life and his own preoccupations,  and one senses that one must approach him with respect.  The little girls'  reactions to him and the Alice-in-Wonderland-esque Catbus often border on  fearfulness, which is exactly the right note to hit -- fear and wonder are  very closely linked, and Miyazaki understands this.\nAnd then there is the  craftmanship of the animation.  The attention to the smallest human  gestures, the careful observation of facial expressions and posture and  other silent behavioral cues -- mixed with the stunning vistas of the  natural world, rendered in beautiful watercolors.  This film is a pure  delight.";Pure joy
240;236.0;5.0;6.0;"What has always amazed me about this film is its lack of standard film conventions.  For example,  the film lacks the usual diabolical villains that stand in the way of the heroes quest.  In fact, ""Totoro""  even lacks a heroes quest, not to mention any sort of obvious conflict that  you would find in any other children's animated film or dumb teen  comedy. And that is because ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is not just any  other animated film or story, it is a revolutionary work that explores the  essence and wonder of what it's like to be a child again. From getting  lost in an enchanted forest to creeping up a stairway that leads into a  dark and dusty attic, Hayoa Miyazaki creates an unbelievably magical feel  that will make you take a second look at the everyday environments that you  might usually take for granted and perhaps even give you a new found  respect for them. There is one scene in here which has received some  concerned criticism mostly from parents in the United States.  In it, a  father and his two daughters share a hot bath together, which was common in  Japan during the time period [circa 1950's].  Many viewers who considered  this scene overtly sexual and perverse have tried and lobbied to edit this  scene out, without success. Miyazaki, who was stunned that anyone could  mistake a completely innocent moment between a father and his children to  be sexual, had this to say [and I'm paraphrasing] ""It is sad that a  culture has come to a point where any interaction between a man and a child  can only be viewed as a sexual one.""  Which is true, and which is why  only a non-American director could make a film without a shred of moral  corruption or cynicism and still make it enjoyable.";A Celebration of Innocence
186;237.0;5.0;5.0;For years and years I have enjoyed the Fox release of this movie.  Now I am excited to see Disney is releasing an improved version of Miyazaki's classic with restored visuals, letterbox and the original japanese soundtrack (as well as new dubs even though the old ones weren't bad).\nIt's sad that Disney took so long to start releasing Miyazaki's movies here in North America but now that they have finally started to fulfill their contract the results have been amazing.  I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone who wants to be entertained in a peaceful and magical way.\nAs you can tell from reading the other reviews here, this movie captivates viewers of all ages.  Even my mom, who hates most animated movies, thought that Totoro stood out as a great movie.;Fox vs Disney
200;238.0;4.0;5.0;My Neighbor Totoro is one of the most charming animated films ever made.  This DVD has no extras, no wide-screen option, and the image could be a bit sharper, but it is still pretty good.\n\nThe artwork is superb--with beautiful countryside scenes, rippling water, rainy busstops, and trees blowing in the wind wonderfully done.  The fantastic spirit creatures (especially the totoros of varying sizes and the Catbus) are charming and clever.\n\nThe human characters are warm and real--in their concern for each other and in their hopes and fears.  I liked the suspense that built up when the 4-year-old Mei tries to visit her mother in the hospital, gets lost, and the whole neighborhood searches for her.  Of course, her older sister, Satsuki, turns to King Totoro for help.  I also liked the magical, dream sequence when Totoro's acorns grow into a giant camphor tree and the children fly with Totoro to the treetops.\n\nHayao Miyazaki produced a great film for children and their parents to enjoy together.  If the DVD was a bit better, I would give it 5 stars.;Great film--worth buying at this price.
202;239.0;4.0;5.0;"This was my second delving into Miyazaki after Spirited Away, and while Spirited Away was the superior film, this was still a very enjoyable movie. This film excels most as a story for small children, one of the best children's movies I have ever seen, in fact. As a parent, one element I love about this movie is that are no typical American clich&eacute;s to be found. There are no villains, fight scenes, and no disbelieving parent or malicious siblings. While the plot may be to simple for adults, it's still charming, and absolutely perfect for children. My only complaint about this DVD has nothing whatsoever to do with the film. FOX has really treated this badly as it's only in pan and scan, there are absolutely no extras, and the sound could use some work. Don't be put off by the cover art either, that's another FOX blunder. The actual film is very visually apealling and doesn't have the garish, cartoony look of the cover art.";One of the Great Children's Movies
204;240.0;5.0;5.0;"I must rate this DVD in two parts. I'll star with the film. A solid 5 stars. This is a film with something for everyone. The entire family can watch it together and enjoy it. There's no villian, no violence, not crude humor, and no objectional material (the family bath scene is completely innocent) Though very young children will probably not notice, older kids might find some of the movie rather upsetting. Scenes like the mother in the hospital and Mei being lost might bother more sensetive children a bit. That being said, This is still a great film for people of all ages. The english dub may sound a bit goofy at first, but once you're use to it (it only takes a few minutes) the voice acting is good and the dialog is solidPart two of my review will focus on the DVD. I give it a single, lonely star. The only reason it recieves one star is becuse the film does have the video and audio clarity you expect from a DVD. Now for the bad: 1) The cover. I dunno who drew this thing, but it's ugly. 2) No special features. This is especially annoying since the menu sheet says ""Acsess 'My Neighbor Totoro' special features by pressing te MENU key on your remote control"" well you can press it all day long and it'll only take you to the simple menu. 3) No japanese option. If you're a purist then this is a major fault. 4) the biggest problem with this DVD is that is has no subtitle feature for the hard of hearing. It's closed captioned, but what about people that have old TVs? While the DVD is very basic, it is also very affordable and the movie alone is worth the purchase price";Miyazaki's most charming film
212;241.0;3.0;5.0;My Neighbor Totoro is a great film and a must have part of even a modest anime collection.  But when I ordered this DVD, it never even crossed my mind that there wouldn't be the original language track.  Japanese sound is standard on any anime DVD.  Although the English dub isn't that bad, I'd still like to have the option to watch it in its original form.  I feel as if I only have half of the movie.  If youfre looking for the original Japanese, unfortunately you'll need to look somewhere else.;No Japanese Sound?!?
217;242.0;3.0;5.0;Ok, I am a snob, I know that, you know that, etc.  But I think that it is MY choice whether to watch a movie in chop+hack (ie pan and scan), not the choice of the DVD publisher.  I think very poorly of FOX for putting this hack-job of a version on DVD.\nTranslation: be forwarned, though a wonderful film, the original technical specs for this film include an aspect ration of 1.85:1, however, this is the pan-and-scan 1.33:1 version.\nOk, end of snobbery, end of rant...;Who tarnished this wonderful movie?!
222;243.0;5.0;5.0;"Although it is not listed, Fox has released a ""full screen"" version of Miyizaki's masterpiece.  This is an abomination and without excuse, since the original is a mere 1:85 if I remember correctly.\nMy Neighbor Totoro is possibly my favorite animated film and it deserves better than this.\nI am returning my copy and I hope that one day Fox will get their act together.";WARNING FULL SCREEN VERSION
231;244.0;5.0;5.0;I'm not sure how the Studio Ghibli will release its movies outside of Japan, but if they are anything like the Japanese release, one is in for a treat.  The Japanese (Region 2) contains two disks.  The first disk contains the movie, with Japanese in 2 channel stereo (the sound is excellent) and English in Mono.  There are also subtitles in Japanese and English available.  The picture is also excellent, and in 16:9 letterbox format.  On the second disk is the movie again, but you can switch between the movie and Miyazawa's beautiful conte storyboards:  you can play the storyboards like a movie with the original soundtrack underneath like a narrated picturebook.  It also contains previews of other Ghibli movies, a featurette on Miyazaki design (Japanese only) and original artwork.  I hope that this release of Tonari no Totoro is released in the US.  Until it is, and you have a DVD player that does region 2, you can order from amazon.co.jp .;Referring to the Japanese edition DVD.
233;245.0;5.0;5.0;"Whoa.  I am amazed that I gave this movie five stars, but I have to.  It has a Cat Bus in it.  For those of you who don't know him, CatBus is a Bus that's a Cat...or a Cat that's a Bus...phew...that alone is worth five stars.\nOk, now that you know about the CatBus let me say a thing or two about the rest of the movie.  This is great animation with an excellent story for kids, immature adults, or anyone who is in a really bad mood.  If you are over the age of 30 and you want to regress quickly into childhood just watch this.  Or, better yet, if you have children and want to give them something good to watch instead of ""All Dogs Go to Heaven 4: Rex and the Right Hand of God"" then I would say buy this movie.

242;246.0;5.0;5.0;A favorite video of both adults and children I know. There is little action, but the story is charming and the animation extremely beautiful. All of Miyazaki's works are very high quality, putting American animation  to shame. Totoro is his most child-oriented story. It has a very different  pace and feeling than most children's animation these days, but still seems  to please children. I have given this video as a gift to three different  children and all of them loved it.;Charming and Beautiful

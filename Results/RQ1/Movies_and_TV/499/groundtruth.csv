364;2.0;5.0;383.0;"This is the fascinating story of two men from Michigan, both of whom began as hunters, and both of whom became members of the National Rifle Association.  From that point, however, their paths sharply diverged and this fascinating Academy Award-winning documentary delineates the divergent paths, leading to a dramatic meeting at the film's culmination.\nDocumentary filmmaker Michael Moore began as an avid hunter from Michigan who joined the NRA, the same organization of which the Oscar-winning film actor Charlton Heston became president.  Moore at the film's beginning shows a determined Heston stating his solid conviction concerning the possession of guns with the words, ""from these cold dead hands.""  Moore jumps straight into the controversy in showing Heston presiding over an NRA convention the same weekend as the Columbine Disaster in Colorado, despite strong opposition from Denver's mayor and large numbers of citizens from the affected community, including parents of victims.\nMoore later tackles another controversy in his home town of Flint, Michigan, when Heston and the NRA met despite strong local opposition following the death of a young local child at the hands of a young boy who brought a gun to class.  Once more, the NRA and Heston went through with their plans.  An analysis of the tragedy resulted in Moore presenting some tragic but fascinating facts concerning situations which should be rectified.  The young boy's African American mother was compelled to make ends meet to catch a bus at the crack of dawn and work two jobs in another town.  One of them was at a yuppie desert parlor owned by Dick Clark, for which he received tax benefits for hiring employees who were previously on the welfare rolls.  The necessity of working two jobs in an effort to make ends meet resulted in the mother getting home late and being unable to properly supervise her child.  Moore sought to discuss the situation, who was plainly not interested and asked his driver to drive off.\nThe fascinating film concludes with Moore receiving an interview opportunity at Heston's Coldwater Canyon mansion.  The confrontation was indeed a memorable one.\nThis film once more solidified Moore's reputation as a daring and humanitarian filmmaker.  He is a true patriot who looks after the interests of those without the financial clout to hire lobbyists and influence presidents, governors and legislators.";Two Men from Michigan
234;3.0;5.0;206.0;"OK, I had heard so many negative things about this movie that I didn't want to bother with it. Then, my beloved brought it home. We watched it together and I completely flipped! Michael Moore is a film-making genius! His guerilla style is perfectly suited for the subject matter. Who else has even attempted to ask the question ""Why so much fear and violence in america?"" without finding simplistic, kneejerk answers? Moore takes us to Columbine to not only relive the tragedy, but to talk with the surviving victims. He even takes them to K Mart's HQ to confront the company's policy of selling handgun ammo (the columbine shooters purchased their bullets at the local k mart) with successful results. This is not just some propoganda film about the evils of gun ownership. Moore himself was raised with guns and still carries his NRA membership card. This movie is about Moore's quest to find out why we love to kill each other so much here in the states. Is it poverty? Nope, other countries have worse economic problems without the bloodletting. Is it violent music or video games? Uh-uh, these are endemic throughout the civilized world. Could it be the proliferation of handguns? No, Canada has millions of guns and it's big cities have the murder rates of our small towns! Is it our violent, gun-toting history? Negative, the entire planet has a bloody, violent past. Moore has the audacity to try to get to the bottom of this mess. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is not for the squeamish or the political zealot from either right or left. It's for folks who wonder at what we've become. It's for people like me who hate the idea of barracading themselves in their homes for fear of being slaughtered. This fear is also challenged here. Many sacred cow arguments are terminated. Prepare to be angered, saddened, provoked, offended, and oddly entertained as only Michael Moore can do. A must own classic...";I Did Not Want To See This Movie...

401;5.0;5.0;100.0;"I have taken 4 friends to see this movie.  I have even seen this movie while I was in Montreal to see what the Canadian reaction would be.  I must say, I was embarrassed to be an American after watching this movie.  I then thought of all the things I should be doing to make this place a better place to live.  In other words, this is a thought provoking movie that is truly provocative.\nYou will see Charles Heston wring his hands in nervousness after he says, ""We don't want any more of that civil rights business going on again"", or ""the reason America is violent is because of all the mixed ethnicities.""  What an idiot.\nAnd that is just what Michael Moore does, he shows people and the government in their natural element speaking freely, and shows us how insane they are and sound.  From George Bush proclaiming that our number one priority should be defense spending when people all over the country are out of work and children are living in poverty without parent supervision, to the crackpot rednecks who are buying more ""guns and ammo"" because they want to protect themselves from the ""evil doers.""  It's this candid honesty of Moore's subjects that makes us look inward to how this country gone astray.  Then Moore tries to explain this with his amazing short animation movie ""A Brief History of the United States of America.""  Although he simplifies everything, and it is truly brief, it hits home and is certainly eye opening.\nMoore tries to explain the question of why America is so violent. Why we are the unique country in the world that kills people with guns on the astronomical level that the United States does.  He offers a lot of options to this answer, but ultimately, he leaves the question open for the viewer to search out within him/herself for the answer and make change.\nA truly great achievement and I can't wait till his next film that is due out 2 months before the election that will no doubt, open up people's eyes to the corrupt and blood thirsty administration that occupies the White House.\nBravo Mr. Moore!  Bravo!";Amazing Movie
435;6.0;1.0;95.0;"While Moore may be a complete and utter idiot, he has a talent for filmmaking. Moore's own assessment of Bowling is to the point: ""It's funny, poignant and interesting, your perfect Saturday night out."" That might of course be said of good\ncomedic fiction.\nFor a documentary, though, one expects more. For example, truth.\nThe point is not that Bowling is unfair, or lacking in objectivity. One might hope that a documentary would be fair and objective, but nothing rules out a rousing\npolemic now and then.\nThe point is far more fundamental: Bowling for Columbine is dishonest. It is fraudulent. It fixes upon a theme, and advances it, whenever necessary, by deception.\nIt even uses the audio/video editor to assemble a Heston speech that Heston did not give, and to turn sympathetic phrases into arrogant ones. You can'teven trust the narrator to read you a plaque, for God's sake.\nHe shows footage of a B-52 on display at the Air Force Academy, while Moore solemnly pronounces that the plaque under it ""proudly\nproclaims that the plane killed Vietnamese people on Christmas Eve of 1972."" Strangely, Moore does not show the plaque.\nActually, the plaque reads that ""Flying out of Utapao Royal Thai Naval Airfield in southeast Thailand, the crew of 'Diamond Lil' shot down a MIG northeast of Hanoi during 'Linebacker II' action on Christmas eve 1972."" This is pretty mild compared to the rest of Bowling, granted. But it illustrates that the viewer can't even trust Moore to honestly read the inscription on a plaque.\nIn a downright diabolical act, Moore equates the NRA with the Klan, suggesting NRA was founded in\n1871, ""the same year that the Klan became an illegal terrorist organization."" Bowling goes on to depict an NRA character helping to light a burning cross.\n  Fact: The Klan wasn't founded in 1871, but in 1866, and quickly became a terrorist organization. One might claim that it technically became an ""illegal""\n  terrorist organization with passage of the federal Ku Klux Klan Act and Enforcement Act in 1871. These criminalized interference with civil rights, and\n  empowered the President to suspend habeas corpus and to use troops to suppress the Klan.\n  Fact: The Klan Act and Enforcement Act were signed into law by President Ulysess S. Grant. Grant used their provisions vigorously,\n  suspending habeas corpus in South Carolina, sending troops into that and other states; under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made and the Klan\n  was dealt a serious (if all too short-lived) blow.\n  Fact: Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan earned him unpopularity among many whites, but Frederick Douglass praised him, and an associate\n  of Douglass wrote that African-Americans ""will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services.""\n  Fact: After Grant left the White House, the NRA elected him as its eighth president.\n  Fact: After Grant's term, the NRA elected General Philip Sheridan, who had removed the governors of Texas and Lousiana for failure to oppose Klan\n  terror.\n  Fact: The affinity of NRA for enemies of the Klan is hardly surprising. The NRA was founded in New York by two former Union officers, its first\n  president was an Army of the Potomac commander, and eight of its first ten presidents were Union veterans.\n  Fact: During the 1950s and 1960s, groups of blacks organized as NRA chapters in order to obtain surplus military rifles to fight off Klansmen.\nThe bottom line: can a film be called a documentary when the viewer cannot trust an iota of it, not only the narration, but the video? I suppose film critics could\ndebate that one for a long time, and some might prefer entertainment and effect to fact and truth. But the Academy Award rules here are specific. Rule 11 lays out\n""Special Rules for the Documentary Award."" And it begins with the definition: ""A documentary film is defined as a non-fiction motion picture . . . ."" It goes on to\nsay that a documentary doesn't always have to show the ""actual occurrence"": it can employ re-enactment, etc., ""as long as the emphasis is on factual content and not\non fiction.""\nSo when awards night rolls around, we will see whether the Academy follows its own core rule, or decides to ignore it so long as the film is one attacking one Charlton Heston, and the NRA.\nThat may win an award at Cannes. It may make some serious money. But it is a disgrace to the documentary creator's art.";A gifted filmmaker of fiction
396;7.0;5.0;85.0;"After the controversial acceptance speech at the Oscars, Michael Moore has been under a lot of heat and, well, it worked to his advantage. As I type this, his book, Stupid White Men is at #1, he is being offered TV spots for his TV Nation/Awful Truth show, and Moore himself is working on his next film, a look at the Bush/bin Laden business relationship.\nSome people will say the movie is ""left-bias,"" but Moore himself was an NRA member and sharpshooter in High School. Some will say Moore never accomplishes his goal (finding out why america is so gun crazy), but the movie comes across more as food for thought. And in the process, he DID educate us about ""welfare to work"" programs and GOT K-MART TO STOP SELLING BULLETS! Did Chicago or My Big Fat Greek Wedding do that? Michael knows exactly how to keep an audience glued to their seats for two hours, and spend the time LECTURING! The ""awful truth"" is that documentaries are generally boring, but with segments like the animated ""history of america"" and ""corporate cops""  Moore manages to get some big laughs out of a very sorrowful movie. And this movie does tug at all your emotions. Laughing at banks which hand out guns, turns to shock during the actual columbine footage (overlapped with radio news covering the tragedy, and the call to 911 from the school). From there, you're given more laughs, but when you hear the story of the young boy who shot and killed a little girl, your heart just sinks. The movie ends with an absurd interview with Charlton Heston in which Moore not only comes out on top, but makes Heston look (even more) like a geriatric bigot with nothing better to do than dance on the graves of victims of gun violence. Left or Right, gun owner, or gun hater, every American should see this movie. If you don't agree with it, fine, but at least it will generate debate. For those of you giving 1 stars simply because of what you heard inside the Kodak Theater, then shame on you. You're obviously writing your review for ""ficticious reasons.""";Shame on you, mr. bad reviewer!
173;8.0;5.0;82.0;I have seen it twice now, once in theatre, and once on DVD. First time I saw it I was impressed, but sceptical about the editing and selection of material. At first I felt that the film was not very good as a documentary, but good as a propaganda film. Now I also think it is good as a documentary. There are no falsehoods in the film. Rather, he has chosen his interviewees well to show what nuts are out there, waving guns. He also tries to show that the gun culture is based on a faulty premiss (crime is on the rise, and we need guns to protect us). He tries to show that the US has a no more violent past than the rest of the world, but is rather a culture based on fear.\nI come from Europe, I am not allowed to buy weapons other than for hunting.  I do not feel particularly unfree. If I have to protect the freedom of my country, I happily don my military uniform and do it collectively. We are actually allowed to buy automatic weapons. The requirement is that we are members of good standing of a shooting club and no criminal record. Most people seem to be able to live with that.;A documentary with a strong message
3;9.0;5.0;84.0;I just got back from seeing this film at the Toronto International Film Festival and I am stunned at how good and powerful this film is.  Michael Moore attended the screening that I saw and he did a little talk before and after the film which gave it some nice perspective.  It does paint an inacurate (in a good way) picture of Canada as a crime free utopia but during his talks Mr. Moore mentioned that it was done by an  American, for Americans and it is meant to be a bitter pill for THEM to swallow, being a Canadian I could appreciate what he was doing despite the inacurate depiction of my home.  This film gives you an odd feeling, at one time you are laughing at how funny it is, then you are on the brink of tears at the sorrow and shock you receive while watching actual Columbine High School security footage, when you see the children run and the two murderers walk in it sends shivers down your spine.  This is perhaps one of Moores best works and very poiniant at a time like this.\nThe title itself is quite clever but a little misleading, the focus of the film is Columbine but it also covers school shootings in general as well as the state of America when it comes to gun control and even foriegn policy in regards to 09/11/01.\nIt opens in theatres in the states on the 11th of Oct. and Mr. Moore commented that he is pleased it opened at the TIFF first as it got a very warm reception with the mostly Canadian audience and he is concerned/interested in seeing how Americans tolerate this work.\nA modern masterpiece that is highly recommended.;"First look at ""Bowling For Columbine"""
214;10.0;1.0;77.0;"When I saw this movie in theaters, I thought it was great.  It didn't try too hard to give you easy answers, and watching people with power squirm made for fun viewing.  It left me feeling empowered.\nNow, however, I'm a little wiser and more skeptical.  People who haven't visited and read the site bowlingfortruth.com are being duped by this film-making mastermind.  Almost every topic or incident in the film contains manipulations and misleading (sometimes even flat out FALSE) information.\nOff the top of my head, I can tell you that:\n- the interview with Charleton Heston was heavily edited, and the details of the NRA rallies are not given full and proper explanation; Heston is not at all the bad guy Moore makes him out to be\n- Kayla Rolland's 6-year-old killer was violent in school almost everyday, and the uncle's house he had been abandoned at and where he found the gun was actually a 'crack house' (among other omitted facts this segment should have featured)\n- the cartoon segment, giving a brief history of the USA's colonization and the founding of the NRA, is remarkably misleading\nThe fact that I came away from the movie, initially, moved and entertained says a lot for Michael Moore's movie-making abilities and infectious underdog enthusiasm.  But the way I see it, the guy must be in it for the money.  I do feel that violence in America is a worthy topic of exploration, but this entire movie is full of deceit.  Please see the website\n[...]\nfor more info.";I am SO disillusioned
480;11.0;5.0;76.0;There is a unique kind of gun violence in America.  We all know that.  So does Michael Moore, the confrontational documentary filmmaker who's not afraid to take on some sacred cows.  He goes after his prey with unrelenting forcefulness.  His [tool], however, is a microphone and a film crew.  And his prey are often unwitting accomplices to the concepts he wants to introduce.  He'll use film clips and newsreel footage and music as well as interviews.  And he sure knows how to play with his audience's emotions to make his point. In this case it's an exploration of gun violence in America.\nWe see Moore opening a bank account in Michigan and receiving a gun as a premium.  We see newsreel footage of the Columbine tragedy and  meet two young survivors who still have bullets in their bodies. We see an interview with an unsuspecting Charlton Heston. The film keeps probing and travels from incident to incident in a seemingly random way.  And yet it keeps escalating in intensity.\nIn spite of its somber subject, the film is ultimately entertaining.  I laughed out loud at the comic, Chris Rock, who suggested that if bullets cost [a fortune] apiece, there would be no innocent bystanders.  I wept real tears at the film clip of the World Trade Center collapsing.  And I'm doing some deep thinking about the statistics.  Yes, it's true that America has a violent past.  But it's certainly not more violent than the pasts of Germany or France or England, where it's difficult to obtain guns and where there are just a handful gun crimes each year.  But then there is Canada, which also has only a small amount of gun crimes.  And, in Canada, gun possession is as common as in the United States.  So what kinds of conclusion can we draw?  I can't think of any easy answers.  And neither can Moore.  And this is the strength of this film.  It asks questions.  It doesn't give answers.\nI give this film a high recommendation.  Don't miss it.  It will give you something to think about.  And you'll want to talk about it too.;Exploring gun violence in America.  Some hard questions.
175;12.0;5.0;65.0;I wish I was shocked by the appaling reviews of Michael Moore's film, but I am not. The bad reviews are sent in by the exact same life time members of the NRA that Moore was trying to get through to. It's sad that the people who need to be enlightened the most are also the ones who are the least likely to become so.\nI thought this film, although perhaps inacurate in some facts had a great intention and a powerful message. Every child in america should watch this film and only then will they be able to make a real decision on what they think is right with regards to gun law and the constitution.;ignorance is death
41;13.0;1.0;59.0;"I was very, very disappointed with this documentary.  It largely consists of editing tricks (lies) to make its point.  Example:\n\nIn one of the Heston speeches, it appears Heston is telling the Columbine mayor ""too bad"" in response to the tragedy.  In reality, if you look carefully, HESTON'S TIE CHANGES COLOR SEVERAL TIMES during the speech.  Hmmm.  Why?  Because Moore is editing together multiple speeches/ random phrases, from many different cities, to give the ILLUSION of a single speech.  Moore is not showing us a real speech.  He's showing us a >fake speech< that he wrote himself & using Heston like a puppet.\n\nWhy does Moore have to create fake speeches to make his point?  Why lie?  It makes no sense.";lie< to make his point
456;14.0;5.0;53.0;"Moore wants to know why the US has more gun-related homicides than any other Western nation. Surprisingly, he concludes, it isn't only the number or availability of handguns. It's fear. His America is a nation of terrified citizens, haunted by unbalanced media with a relentless daily focus on global and suburban threat, driven to seek refuge in the right to bear arms. Guns and fear are a lethal combination, and the statistics speak for themselves: over 11,000 killings annually, when most other nations don't even make triple digits. Moore's thesis is a surprising one in that it contradicts America's image of brash self-confidence, but the evidence is compelling. There are some wonderful moments in this documentary: Marilyn Manson's surprisingly articulate analysis of why his music is blamed for teen violence and his take on the actual factors which inspire it; a former producer of ""COPS"" frankly admitting that violence makes for good television; and music guru Dick Clark refusing to even listen to (let alone answer) questions about a welfare worker from one of his mall developments. But the real stars are the ordinary people: the police, the teachers, a tearful security expert, the academics, the polticians, and two young survivors of Columbine who, with Moore's help, literally disarm K-Mart.  Moore spends plenty of time on the narrative soapbox and edits together some heavily polemical montages, but for the most part he just rolls tape, asks questions, and lets the idiots bury themselves - none more so than Charlton Heston who, when confronted with uncomfortable questions about NRA strategy and his own apparent racism, is left speechless. As the head of a national organization zealously promoting gun ownership, you'd think he'd have some answers. But he just walks away. What a pity the dead can't do the same.";The land of the 'fraid
7;15.0;1.0;12.0;"Moore tries half heartedly to pass himself off as not anti-gun by showing us his childhood shooting rifles, but too many times during this tediously long and poorly shot and edited collection of scenes.\n\nHe criticizes the media for instilling fear in the public, yet resorts to a tried and true media tactic of 'man on the street' interviews with seemingly moronic people whose comments had my eye twitching more than once.\n\nMoore slips in off handed commentary throughout that clearly reveal his disdain for the establishment and, like every other liberal extremist out there, wants to blame everyone else for the actions of the degenerate elements in our society. He paints south central LA as a veritable Garden of Eden with an undeserved reputation for crime and violence, and asks police officers if they're going to arrest someone for the smog in LA; while they're investigating an active crime scene.\n\nI didn't care for him before; believe it or not after watching this piece of garbage, I dislike him even more.\n\nI watched this because my fiance insisted I do. She knew I didn't like his other stinking turd ""Fahrenheit 911"" but thought this might change my mind. But between his totally biased viewpoint and the low quality of the production itself, my opinion of Moore and his work is as low as it ever was.";Militant Liberal Propaganda
465;16.0;5.0;51.0;"Some of the reviews I've been reading of ""Bowling for Columbine"" remind me of a statement that a Canadian makes about Americans in the film - that we don't think before we react.  Obviously, certain people were angered by this film (hopefully everyone was at least once) and for some reason don't like Michael Moore and have written their reviews before letting it all soak in.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" has just that - a lot to soak in.  I will not give away parts of this film because it truly has to be witnessed to be believed.  I can't believe this even came out to the theatres.  I would like to respond to a few things others are saying who obviously don't fully get what is presented in this film.  First off, ""Bowling for Columbine"" IS NOT a comedy.  Yes, it has laughs and funny ironies, but it is not a movie you go to for a good happy laughing experience.  This is a documentary film with a focus on gun control and gun violence, which also includes segments on racism, the media, and other politics.  This is not a movie you just shrug off and giggle at - this movie should not be called ""hilarious"" because it never comes near it.  It is also not for the faint of heart because there is footage of actual shootings, Security camera video from the Columbine High School, and also footage of the second tower of the World Trade Center being attacked.  How anyone could call or expect a film with this footage to be a comedy is beyond me.  I don't consider myself to be a liberal or conservative, but the facts are the facts and yes some things in this film are a little biased and maybe even over exaggerated, but the people who Moore interviews speak for themselves.  Moore isn't ""making them look bad"", they make theirselves look bad.  All I see Moore doing is asking questions...he's not accusing them of anything.  The way they respond is up to them.  I don't have a problem believing these enormously rich famous people like Heston and Clark are represented realistically in this film.  Why should they care?  These guys are so far removed from reality its not even funny. I love Heston fumbling with words trying to justify why he, a rich movie star who lives in a gated fortress probably with his own security team, has to have loaded guns in his house.  Even better is the part with Dick Clark (I won't ruin it). Another scene involves a TV reporter who ""acts"" emotional when covering a story about a murdered child on the air and as soon as the camera is off he starts laughing and worrying about his hair...as soon as its time to go back on - he puts his ""sad"" face on - priceless.  In scenes like these and many others Moore doesn't have to say a word because these people bury themselves.  I wish this kind of footage would be shown more often - footage showing what people are really like when the camera goes off.  Marilyn Manson has one of the best and most intelligent comments in the film about what he would say to the victims of Columbine - Everyone who dislikes Manson should hear what he has to say in this segment.  I'm not really even a fan of his, but he made more sense in 5 sentences than most any other famous people interviewed in the film.  Also of notable mention is Matt Stone of South Park fame who actually attended Columbine High.  His statements are also important - especially the one about High School seeming so important when you're going through it, but when it's over...its really over.  The real stars of ""Bowling for Columbine"" are the non-famous people who either have had first hand experience or just voice their opinions.  These people actually live in the real world...not in some mansion surrounded by guards & yes-men.  I think people are going to be mad at this film because its too much to handle and accept.  I'm not saying that everything in this film is all true, but most of it obviously is and I think the people who hate Moore and call him ""Anti-American"" or ""Communist"" actually just hate the idea of admitting there is truth here about our Country.  It's alright to be an American, a ""good"" American, and still be aware and critical, even angry at the injustices and stupidity that goes on around you.  People who think Moore is ""Anti-American"" should watch his film ""Roger & Me"".  That film is for Americans and about Americans.  The film centers around the closing of a General Motors plant in Flint, Michigan and the devastating effect it had on that town and the thousands of people who lost their jobs.  ""Bowling for Columbine"", like ""Roger & Me"", presents some hard undeniable truths and if people are not ready to deal with them, maybe they should go see something else...better yet, maybe the perfect time to see this is when you're not ready.  This is a very important film, if for anything because it makes you think and form opinions.  Moore doesn't tell you what to think at anytime in his films.  You see what you see and interpret it.  If you're angry when you leave the theatre or emotionally overwhelmed...you should be.";Some people are just not getting it.
457;17.0;1.0;50.0;The 'facts' presented in this movie deserve special attention. The reason for this is that Moore deliberately misleads his audience. For instance, he emphasizes the fact that more than 11,000 Americans die from guns every year. How many of these people were shot by the police while committing a violent crime? He does not say. How many of these people were shot by private citizens while commiting a crime? He does not say. How many of these people committed suicide? He does not say.\nWhen anybody uses a gun in self-defense and in so doing protects an innocent life that is a good thing- and makes the case for private gun ownership. Every suicide is a tragedy. But people will commit suicide with or without guns. Moore obscures the facts by citing aggregate data.\nFor evidence, Moore relies primarily on anecdotes that depict illegitimate uses of guns. Sure, there are people who will commit violent crimes. That is why having guns legal is a good idea. Honest people who want an effective means of self-defense need guns, and handguns in particular.\nMoore interviewed the weirdest gun owners he could find. It is no surprise that, in a country of close to 300 million people, Moore could find five or ten gun owners who were very strange. So what? There are millions of gun owners who are just normal people.\nMoore took on Charelton Heston in this movie. Heston is just an actor and a spokesman. Moore could have taken on John Lott instead. Lott is a scholar who did a county by county study on guns. What were his results? Private gun ownership leads to less violent crime and makes honest people safer. Of course, not everyone is safer- criminals are significantly less safe when states adopt concealed carry laws. This is what the statistics show. Lott is the leading scholar on this issue. Moore could have interviewed him, but he is not interested in the real facts.\nMoore contends that fear is the reason for Americas' gun death rate. Supposedly, we are all scared, so we get guns and then as we panick from all of this fear, we shoot each other. He emphasizes the fear that white Americans supposedly have for black Americans. Does he list data from any study or survey? No. He shows us a cartoon instead. Anyone over the age of eight who takes this seriously should seek professional help. He claims that the government is scaring us. He claims that the media is scaring us. He claims that 9-11 is scaring us into shooting each other too. Where is his proof? He has none. He makes these claims without substantiating them.\nHe claims that Canadians, have guns but not fear. How does he prove this? He asked several Canadians. He also found several Canadians who did not lock their doors. Assuming that he did not stage these things, what does this prove? Are we supposed to infer something about entire nations simply because he talked to a couple of people and opened several doors?\nThere is fear at work here. Moore finds the creepiest gun owners to scare us. Moore uses a few tragedies- Columbine and Flint in particular- to scare us. Never mind about the millions of murders, rapes, beatings, thefts, and other crimes that private guns prevent. He uses the absolute worst examples of private gun use and the strangest gun owners to scare us- and then has the nerve to claim that gun violence derives from others who try to scare us.\nThere is more than fear mongering in this movie. Moore is also a shameless demagogue. Moore takes two victims from Columbine to KMART. He does this in order to pressure this company into ending its sales of handgun ammunition. He also shows the father of one who died at Columbine. Never mind about the victims of violent crime in places like NYC and Washington DC. These places ban guns, thus leaving decent people at the mercy of violent thugs. Never mind about the thousands who get murdered or brutalized in these illegal gun/high crime areas. Never mind about the facts. Never mind about the truth. Moore is out to play upon people emotions and fears, and will stop at nothing to do it. He could look at the general statistics on gun ownership and crime, but he prefers to exploit the suffering of two Columbine victims. His aim clearly is to evoke strong emotions while suppressing critical thought.\nMoore also ignores a major source of violent crime in American. There was an increase in gun violence during the prohibition of alcohol. This gun violence ended when The war on alcohol ended. Now the war on marijuana has gangs shooting it out with each other and the police again. We can end much violent crime and greatly reduce that 11,000+ death statistic figure he cites by legalizing marijuana. Moore ignores this fact.\nBowling for Columbine is a shallow and shameless attempt to demagogue the gun issue. He uses selective, misleading, and anecdotal data to provoke fear of guns and anger against gun rights advocates. He evades the strongest advocates of gun rights so as to avoid having to deal with real arguments and data. He flails at straw men because the facts are against him. Moore sets a new standard for shameless demagoguery and misinformation with this movie. In fact, he is so brazen in the way he tries to scare and manipulate his audience that only closed-minded ideologues will take him seriously. Thinking people will see through his charade easily.;Not for Thinkers
471;18.0;5.0;41.0;"As I left the theater after watching Micheal Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" I was drowning in thought about what I had just seen. As a young American entering the work force in less than a year, I found some of the film disturbing (footage from the security cameras inside Columbine High School during the shooting), some of it inspiring (he and 2 survivors of Columbine visit Kmart corporate headquarters), and some of it downright hilarious (Chris Rock's take on how to control gun violence). Ultimately, that's what I love in a movie. Some may critcize the film for not answering the many questions it poses, such as 'Why are there so many more gun deaths in this country than others with roughly the same ratio of guns?' Not every issue has an answer, and unfortunately, gun control in this country is one of them. The film does offer possibilities, and explores both sides of each one, which is refreshing coming from one person. With shows like Crossfire and even Pardon the Interruption, everyone seems to have to have a rigid opinion on everything. Micheal Moore doesn't pretend to know the answers in this film and shows that he, like the rest of us, is human. He just presents the problem to you and leaves you to walk out of the theater and choose to either think about what you've just seen, or just walk away bewildered and confused. ""Bowling for Columbine"" managed to get into my head and make me want to be a difference maker in this counrty. That's what I look for in a movie.";Incredible Documentary
236;19.0;1.0;39.0;"I refused to subscribe to the hype surrounding this feature until I saw it and analyzed it for myself. (For the record, I'm politically independent). After viewing it, I have to say I am now one of its detractors.\nWhat could have been an interesting look at America's gun culture and the sources of the Columbine massacre is instead an overhyped and poorly structured mess. Nearly every argument Moore expounds is flawed by his patronizing and sanctimonious attitude towards the truth. During the course of this documentary he:\n1) Misquotes stats to fit his agenda. He does this so much that I'm not going to waste time documenting every example. He notes that Canada has double our unemployment rate but many fewer homicides, failing to note that Canada's population is smaller than ours; in other words, he doesn't consider crimes by percentage of population; rather, he just looks at percentages overall. He also states that Canadians have seven million guns in ten million homes, but they have fewer homicides. Well, Canada has much stricter handgun licensing and registration laws than the US; i.e.; they have better gun control; yet Moore undermines his own point by stating that our looser gun control laws aren't the reason for gun violence; it's our culture. So, why try to make a serious, defining point about Canada's rate of gun ownership if you're going to make it irrelevant with your own words? He also ignores the decline in youth violence and school shootings. He holds up two incidents--Columbine, and a shooting in Flint, Michigan--as examples of an ""epidemic.""\nMoore also claims that overseas military action by the US goverment is part of the reason for our ""culture of violence,"" citing the bombing of Afghanistan as evidence of our aggression. He notes that the United Kingdom has a substantially smaller number of homicides than the US. He fails to acknowledge, however, the UK's role in the bombing of Yugoslavia and its role in the military action in Iraq. If the two are interrelated, then why the discrepancy? He also tries to accuse the US of funding the same Taliban regime responsible for harboring Bin Laden and Al Qaeda when he ominously notes that the US gave $245 million to Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001. Wrong again, Michael. That money was given to the UN and independent organizations for famine relief.\n2) He alters the notorious 1988 Bush/Quayle ""Willie Horton"" ad by adding some superimposed text: ""Willie Horton released. Then he kills again."" This was NEVER in the original ad (available online, if you want proof) but Moore somehow forgets to note this alteration and just lets his audience assume that it's the truth. (For the record, after being released, Horton did not kill; he committed rape).\n3) Moore is generally guilty of every sin he accuses the media of committing. He argues time and again that the media is reponsible for America's culture of fear and violence. He implies that they sensationalize violence and portray certain people--namely blacks--in stereotypical ways. That's funny, because Moore spends a fair portion of time both sensationalizing violence and portraying mean-spirited stereotypes--not of blacks, but of average-Joe, working-class gun owners. They come across as ignorant, uneducated rednecks, with Moore pausing occasionally for a bit of juvenile humor at their expense. This is especially egregious, since Moore has long championed himself as an advocate of the working class; yet he spends a great deal of time mocking them.\n--He also resorts to the worst tactics of tabloid journalism, getting people to cry on camera (while he provides comfort) or attempting to interview people only vaguely attached to the Columbine massacre (such as Dick Clark). He brings two wounded Columbine students to KMart's headquarters, guilting them into dropping their sale of ammunition. (Funny, though; he doesn't speak of going after the companies that made the chemicals in Klebold and Harris' homemade bombs). The nadir, however, is his ambush interview of NRA president Charlton Heston, who seems both confused and outraged. Even if Heston had had all of his faculties, Moore would have made a mess of this interview. His line of questioning was incoherent, unconnected and irrelevant. It is obvious that he only sought to embarrass Heston (Moore's dislike of him is well-known) rather than gain any insight for his viewers. It is an unconfortable and tasteless segment.\nWhat a mess. Moore, who showed some talent as a filmmaker with the wry (but statistically flawed) ""Roger and Me,"" has used his abilities to produce a shoddy, irresponsible documentary that is a serious affront to the truth. Moore would have better served us by addressing some of the unanswered questions about Columbine--the possibility of a 3rd gunman, was there advanced warning, etc.--than by wasting our time with this travesty.\nI am sorry this is so long, but I felt that these were things that needed to be said.";An honest review
454;20.0;5.0;40.0;Say what you will about this movie and Michael Moore's agenda, he has made a powerful, powerful film.  It is not an anti-gun movie (Moore is apparently a lifetime NRA member).  It is more a reflection on American society and the violence which is so pervasive.  Canadians have millions of guns and their homicide rate by use of the gun is all but nil.  So too many, many other countries -- their homicide by use of the gun dribbles down to almost nonexistent.  In America, over 10,000 people per year are killed by a gun.  The ol' maxim that 'guns don't kill people, people kill people' is perhaps the theme of the film.  The big question is why it is that this country, one espousing such freedom, has such a disproportionate homicide rate.\nThere are moments of high comedy (South Park's history of America is in the film and it is a hoot) and moments of feelings that go deep (footage from Columbine) and moments of great irony (the quote given by an interviewee just before a rather gruesome list (and footage) of America's history of use of bombs is displayed).  Moore has assembled a tapestry that amazingly weaves in and around Flint, Michigan (and, oddly, bowling) and he has talked with a great many people, from the creators of South Park (students of Columbine) to Charlton Heston, to the father of a child killed at Columbine to gun totin' militamen from his home state, for a diversity of points of view of the issue.\nIt may seem to some that he is provoking a desired response by his questioning but the reality is that the answers given by those he interviewed speak freely and it is their words, spoken with conviction and sincerity, that ultimately leave the viewer mystified.\nThe interview with Charlton Heston left me speechless.  The man who boldly proclaims 'from my dead hands' reveals another side of himself.\nAll in all, the movie is disturbing but it is not brashly so.  It merely reveals to us all the various absurdities in the freedom we so cherish.  This film should be viewed by everyone who is troubled by the violence in this country.;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be stunned...
376;21.0;5.0;38.0;This is the first documentary that I have ever seen and I was blown away. The movie had so much reality to it, it had so much humor, it had so much.....seriousness to it. It had everything a big Hollywood movie has except more real.\nAfter director/writer/producer Micheal Moore was blasted at the Oscars for his verbal attacks on America I just knew that I had to see his film on the topic of gun control. When I finally saw it when it was on it's last breath in Manhattan I was really glad that I payed ten dollars to see it.\nIt starts off with Micheal Moore going into a bank. The bank says that if you open a special account you get a free gun. It then rolls off to people opionions about owning guns, using guns for protection, and the 2nd amendement which enables every man to bear arms. We are even treated to a five minute cartoon about American History.\nThe film had all different kinds of angles. There was Micheal Moore private filming. There were special news reels and footage. What had me interested the most was how when they were talking about the Columbine shootings they showed the actual tapes that the school had. We saw the kids being forced to go under the tables, we saw the two kids responsible for the shootings looking around and mabey even communcating with one another. I was wondering throughout the movie why anybody would want to do that. Who wound get angry enough to kill people who are of a different race, religion, and ethics just because they are different. It was a movie that I was thinking about even after I left the theatre.\nWe were provided with interviews with people who lived in the area, people in other countries, and celebrites like NRA president and actor Charlten Heston, singing Marilyn Manson, and South Park co-creator Matt Stone who went to Columbine School. We saw the large comparisions between the murders and deaths from guns to our country to the amount of others. In Canada there are 65 people who are killed by guns a year. In America 11,127 people are killed by guns per year. In Cananda, people go to bed with doors unlocked. Moore even opened various doors of houses in Cananda to prove this.\nI am just naming a few things that this movie does. Thid movie talks about various other shooting including the death of a six year old girl who was killed by a six year old boy who found a gun in his uncles house and took it. This movie has terrible topics, but it's all true.;Amazing! Humerous, Touching, and Real!
460;22.0;5.0;38.0;"Criticizing Entitlement to Fear, Violence, and Murder\nMichael Moore's caustic, and critically important documentary, ""Bowling For Columbine"" will outrage anyone with extremist attitudes about the United States and gun ownership, but will probably resonate with anyone who wants to know why so many Americans kill each other. While Moore is often labeled a leftist, this film is more practical than it is radical. Compelled to understand how and why incidents like the Columbine shootings took place, Moore examines America's longstanding preoccupation with crime, violence, and gun ownership, and he comes to some pretty surprising conclusions.\nMoore debunks many prevailing myths about the relationship between gun ownership and violence in America. Gun enthusiasts will be pleased to learn, according to Moore, that it is not easy access to firearms alone that results in so many gun deaths in America. After all, guns of all types are readily available in Canada where the murder rate per capita is far lower than the United States. In terms of America's violent history, Moore points out that nations with an arguably more violent history, including Germany, Japan, and Britain also have a far lower murder rate per capita than the United States. If you believe that the answer must be all of those violent movies and video games, then think again. Moore demonstrates that most developing nations, share America's enthusiasm for violent films and video games, but have a much smaller murder rate per capita. More even examines the assertion of several of his interviewees that it is minorities, particularly black people, who cause so much violent crime. Walking down the streets of Canadian cities, Moore demonstrates that they are as multiethnic as any major American city but hardly as violent. So why does America have a much higher rate of gun related murder and violence than the rest of the developed world?\nThe answer, according to Moore, is fear. With the help of a hilarious but completely accurate cartoon, Moore demonstrates that from the moment of the Pilgrims' arrival, America was practically founded on fear. Unsurprisingly Moore also demonstrates how successfully the media--particularly televised news--and politicians profit from whipping up fear. As if this were not enough, Moore exposes some of the more outlandish things that popular culture and advertising instruct us to be afraid of such as escalators, prescription drugs, and African ""killer"" bees (the European ones are supposed to be OK). One can't help but remember Franklin Delano Roosevelt's famous declaration that Americans had nothing to fear but fear itself.\nAlthough ""Bowling for Columbine"" is riddled with humor, Moore never resorts to insulting his subjects, even if they seem bizarre. When interviewing members of the Michigan Militia, for example, he treats them with seriousness and respect. Similarly, when interviewing a security consultant in Littleton Colorado, Moore accords him dignity and respect when the detached and objective individual suddenly becomes emotional about the Columbine shootings. Even the supposedly scandalous parts of this film such as Moore's interviews with Kmart management, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston involve no more than his simply showing them the end results of their beliefs and actions.\nIt is fascinating to see this documentary in a theatre and to observe the audience's reaction. A friend saw this film in a mall theater with a mostly teenaged audience whom he was sure did not connect with it at all, yet when the film ended the Audience burst into applause. When I saw this film in an upper middle class theater, the older, more affluent audience simply sat stunned long after the last credit had passed. It seemed that having been exposed to a simple but well concealed truth they were now eager for some type of resolution, which, of course, the film could not deliver.";Criticizing Entitlement to Fear, Violence, and Murder

I originally went along with it and actually believed he was presenting honest and truthful information, but only giving his side of the story.  Since this however, an overwhelming amount of information has been uncovered that has shown that Mr. Moore went out of his way to decieve his audience and flat out lie.  For one, pieces of video of several different NRA meetings were edited together to make it appear to be a single meeting and creating an effect that he desired to ""prove"" his point.  The factory that produced the ""weapons of mass destruction"" made rockets to send satellites into space.  Much information is left out about the NRA's meetings in Colorado and Michigan, as well as lies being produced about them.  The list is nearly endless.  For more information, check out [...]  This is just one source among many.  Just thought it may be a good idea to check some facts before mindlessly believing the stuff Michael Moore spits out.

146;25.0;1.0;34.0;~As a Canadian living in the United States, I was very interested in Mr. Moore's bizarre and extremely dishonest portrayal of the Canadian experience. There was a worse mass shooting than Columbine in my home town of Montreal about fifteen years ago: 14 people were shot dead at the University of Quebec at Montreal in 1989.  And the day after Columbine, there was a deadly copy-cat shooting at a high school in the Canadian province of Alberta.\n  Almost everything that he says about Canada~~ is false.  He claims that Canadians don't have to lock their doors, but that is nonsense: Canada has higher rates of burglary than the US.  He also claims that minorities make up 11% of the population in both countries, but that is a lie: Blacks and Hispanics alone are 25% of the US, while they make up only 3% of the population in Canada.\n  And it isn't just Canada he lies about.  Germany had a worse high school shooting than Columbine a few years ago, and the worst school shooting of~~ all time occured about ten years ago in Scotland, so the problem is not an American one.\n  Honest criticism of the United States doesn't make one anti-American.  But when your criticism is based on repeated lies, as Mr. Moore's is, then it most certainly is.~;A Canadian Looks at the Ugliest American
379;26.0;1.0;35.0;From the title on this is a pure work of fiction.  Michael Moore rewrites history and edits and splices audio and text freely to portray people as saying things that they never said.  He staged scenes and presented them as candid shots.  In his attempt to denigrate America he lies about everything from the year that the KKK was founded to the text on a B-52 memorial at the Air Force Academy to the sattelite launch vehicles built in Littleton.  It is very telling that he can not make his case based on facts, and is forced to resort to fiction while claiming it to be a documentary.  He portrays gun owners as ignorant fearmongers, but ultimately the joke is on his intended audience who accept his fiction as fact and buy into his own fearmongering.;A work of fiction
328;27.0;5.0;34.0;"Let me start off by saying that BFC is not a Documentary, its one man's opinion about gun violence in America. Moore uses numerous events like Ruby Ridge and Columbine to ask ""are we nuts for guns or are we gun nuts"". Moore interviews many people who all quote the second amendment (The right to bear arms), Here's a little secret, The reason that amendment was put up so we could build up a effecient militia quickly. Does it honestly apply today? I'm in no fear of my life. There has been allegations saying that Lockheed Martin only makes sattelites, WRONG!. They make guidance systems for nuclear missles. I found out by going to their website. I'll believe that the Littleton Lockheed Martin plant doesn't make missles, but that doesn't make it any sunnier for them. If you look at this movie from different political sides, of course you're gonna react if you are conservative and enjoy it if you are liberal. All these reviews are coming from either gun pro or non pro, Moore is credible in this fact because he is neither. I give it a 5 because its a neutral political statement about one of our worst problems.";"A powerful political statement in the ""style"" of a doc"
496;28.0;5.0;34.0;"There hasn't been a documentary or a book Moore has done that I haven't liked. Bowling for Columbine is a bittersweet, humorous and, at the same time, upsetting commentary on guns and killing in America. Without stridency, Moore accomplishes this via stock footage, via interviews (notably with one of the Columbine alumnae who happens to be half of the South Park creative team) and through an effort to place an historical frame around the ""killingness"" of the American psyche.\nParticularly alarming are an attempted interview with Dick Clark--owner of a Michigan eatery where the mother of a six-year-old (who shot and killed a six-year-old classmate with his uncle's handgun) works. This eatery has applied for tax credits for hiring welfare-to-work employees (only a little obscene, this request for subsidy for underpaid employees). Clark blows Moore off with no pretense of manners or grace. Scary stuff. Even scarier is Moore's sit-down interview with Charlton (call me Chuck) Heston, larger-than-life long-term walking, talking symbol of the NRA. Spouting propaganda and refusing even to discuss anything other than ""every American's right to bear arms,"" Heston is old, shambling and rigidly inarticulate. He is emblematic of so many of the gun-toting people Moore speaks with in the course of the film.\nThe title, derived from the fact that the two Columbine shooters were on the school's bowling team (a credited part of the sports curriculum) and possibly bowled a couple of games the morning they attacked their fellow students, is at once amusing and, on a deeper level, alarming. When schools start giving credit for bowling, we're in trouble. When heavily armed kids enter a school and shoot other kids at random before taking their own lives, we're in serious trouble.\nUsing relatively non-violent Canada as an example (among many) of countries with gun-related death rates that don't even register on the American scale is slightly misleading. While it's true that my native Canada has a relatively low murder rate, the societal reasons why are never satisfactorily answered. Still, this film is, to all intents and purposes, a mirror held up to reflect pervasive American attitudes that are rooted in fear; about a media that thrives on bloodshed, and a society that has been taught to fear those who are ""different"": people of color, ethnicity, or  sexual preference.\nThis is an important, thoughtful, good-humored, and heartstring-tugging film. Don't miss it.\nMost highly recommended.";Another wonderful Moore product
408;29.0;5.0;33.0;"It's easy enough to watch this movie and say it's a liberal attempt to dissuade people from owning guns. In fact, most of the information in the picture was regarding American's love affair with guns. But this movie is NOT about gun control. This is a movie about fear. This is a movie about why Americans kill.\nFrom the very beginning, Moore begins to ask the question, ""Why is the murder rate in America so much higher than in other countries."" The answer he came up with? Because Americans live in fear. He illistarted this point in Canada by walking up to front doors and opening them, just to see if they were locked. What town in America could we find this?\nAfter seeing this movie, I realized how much in my life is governed by fear - fear of being robbed, fear for my children, fear of what people will think of me. It startled me how much of my life is based soley on fear... all the precautions I take. Even with 11,000 murders in this country every year, the odds of me getting killed by murder today is astronimical. Same with the odds of me getting robbed, or my children getting kidnapped. It happens, yes. But how many of you know someone that was murdered personally? How many people do you know that have been kidnapped? I'm sure there are a few out there, but for the average person, you don't run across that much. This is the point Moore is making in this movie.\nSee this film. If you're a ""gun nut"" all the better. Moore makes the point that it's not the guns but the attitude of the people that makes the difference. See the movie, and don't be so quick to get offended. If you're a Charlton Heston fan... well, see the movie anyways, but you might not like what you see.";Gun Control? Not at all!
375;30.0;1.0;32.0;Muddled and spurious. Most irritating moment is the flash card run through of America's alleged misdemeanours abroad which were supposed to be accepted on some subliminal level rather than thought about.\nIf you pose the question as to why there is such a high level of gun crime in the States then it might be worth your while looking at the convictions and drawing some conclusion as to the motivations behind them. At one point we are shown a quick collage of video recorded shootings for the purpose of illustrating the point that Americans kill each other rather than examining why. It's curious that Moore should lambast American imperialism while showing indifference to a foreign audience who may not be familiar with the background story behind the clips. Doesn't he care that we might like to know or does he think it's irrelevant because he merely wanted to point out that guns discharge bullets? I do recognise the clips, which have been aired in the UK in various documentaries. One was the highway guy who I think was shot by a police marksman. Less familiar was the man trying to shoot a women as she lay screaming on some grass and it was distressing to have been subjected to this while being kept in the dark about why this was happening. The footage of a man in police custody being shot in the head I recall as occuring at a courthouse where the man was about to go on trial for raping the assailant's child. The motivation of this crime would appear to be revenge then, rather than the catch-all 'fear' that Moore seemed to be pushing without question. What else would examining gun crime convictions reveal, if he had bothered? How many gun murders occur during robberies, for instance? The motivation could be unwillingness to work for a living, rather than fear. Moore questionably states that the poverty issue is the preserve of the left but wouldn't it be worthwhile talking to the criminals who actually commit crimes rather than scoring political points? Of course, prisons are full of innocent men, but some are honest about discussing their failings. Knocking on Canadian doors is less illuminating and statistically meaningless, too.\nI'm also minded of how television stations in Britain often cancel films that may offend those who have been the recent victims of an air disaster or child abduction, only to show them two weeks later. Likewise with the Heston interview. Is it any more morally acceptable for Heston to cancel his visits to Flint and others mentioned only to arrive at a later date when the victim's families may be less bereaved? Moore ducks this question. Why should Moore expect Heston to be held to account for the death of the little girl when Moore himself is a NRA member? Just because he wouldn't have been crass enough to show up at the meeting?\nOne of the reasons often put forward in favour of having a gun in every home in the States is to prevent a totalitarian government from oppressing the people after a coup. The film doesn't examine this interesting point. After all, it beggers the question as to how, if a totalitarian administration would be unable to impose it's will on an armed American people, can a democratically elected government enforce the legitimate laws of the land now? Certainly there seems to be this very problem already with some of the Militias portrayed in the film. A better documentary still awaits on this subject matter.;Poor

461;36.0;5.0;30.0;"The genius of Michael Moore is not that he makes you laugh (even Adam Sandler can do that!), but that he makes you think after you laugh. Certainly this is not a guffaw-fest, anyone familiar with Moore's work can tell you that his work is fueled by outrage as much as it is by humor.\nBut despite its unfortunate marketing as a ""hilarious"" film, this is an important movie to see. In fact I would say that everyone in high school and college (and all of you who are beyond that too) should go see this movie. Forget learning about the seperation of powers, this movie should be required viewing for every single class on civics, political science, anthropology and sociology.\nThere's a certain naivete to the views of those who argue that Moore shouldn't have ""ambushed"" K-Mart, Charleton Heston or Dick Clark and that he overplayed the role of racism in US society. First of all, Moore tried unsucessfully for two whole years to get a sit-down interview with Heston. The tactic of turning up at his house (using a Hollywood Map of the Homes of the Stars) was a desperate last-minute tactic. Anyone who has tried to get a straight answer from a powerful corporation or individual with publicists, assistants and ""communications directors"" will know that you will only get a straight answer when it suits THEM and never when it only suits you. Sound paranoid? Just try calling your local HMO.\nWith regard to the racism. Maybe Moore was being a bit glib (ditto his laundry list of US foreign policy disasters -all of which are extensively documented by the way by non-partisan groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and by reputable right and left-wing academics -and I don't just mean Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky although I have no quarrel with them-, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde, and even the Frankfurter Allgemeine). But the essence of his argument is sound.\nRacial hierarchy in this country was and is structured by fear. Before the Civil Rights movement, this fear and intimidation was aimed by groups of white people at black people (e.g. the Klan). After the 1950s, this fear was increasingly fostered (often unconsciously or semi-consiously) among white people. The South Park style cartoons were a bit heavy handed but they were probably a better creative choice than some boring academic sitting in an office, and you would NEVER have gotten people to say stuff on camera because they know its not cool to go there. But they say it, you all know (if you're Euro-american) because you've heard them say it around you, if not directly to you.\nLikewise fear keeps people (both black and white) from interacting with one another as equals. It may not be ""fear for my life"" type fear but there is a sense of social distance which is the legacy of this fear that ultimately paralyzes the undoubted goodwill that most people have towards one another as individuals, and more often than not renders meaningful human contact between the races contingent, superficial and fragile.\nI remember walking around St. Louis and noticing all the well-to-do blocks of houses with security fences, guard posts, 24-hour armed response signs, burglar alarms, one-way street signs and concrete barriers placed at the intersections of their streets with those of the adjacent lower-income (working and poor folks) neighborhoods (oh yeah, the poorer folks were mostly black too) to stop people even driving into their streets from the ""wrong"" side of town. Talk about Fortress America. And these people are free and happy and open-minded? I really don't know.\nMoore points out that fear (along with the demands of the ""New Economy"" on poor people) is one of the biggest contributors to social problems (including gun violence) in the United States. A lot of people are taking this idea seriously now (it's not just Moore's own personal bandwagon). Maybe you don't feel like you fear others, but how about this: Do you trust them? If you don't, I would argue that some of that is based in fear -of something whether its the power of a boss to fire you or the idea that you might not be able to feed your kids if ""something"" happens to you. I'm not saying that people shouldn't be careful but the difference between caution and suspicion is much subtler than you think.\nOne of the best things in the movie was a comment by a Canadian who said something like, ""When we see Americans locking their doors and putting bars on their windows, we don't see them as protecting themselves, we see them as having imprisoned themselves in their own homes."" Think about it for a second, are you really free? Go see the movie and tell me what you think.";Are we really free?
62;37.0;1.0;28.0;"In the spirit of, ""I'll suffer so you don't have to,"" I decided to rent Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine yesterday.  After the filmmaker's regal reception at the Democratic Party convention, where he was seated next to President Carter, I realized that not bothering to view his works would forever hamper my ability to defeat his positions. What I saw was more horrifying (and boring) than I ever expected.  This movie won countless awards and is loved thousands of people but it amounts to little more than the enactment of one cheap emotional stunt after another.\n\nMoore is the star of the film and we unfortunately are subjected to his lumbering, dour, guilt-racked frame in shot after shot.  He is constantly lead-faced and saddened; appalled and unflinching.  He will go to any length to uncover the truth-provided he doesn't have to deal with clever people who may disagree with him.\n\nMoore's outlook is the embodiment of the Manichean worldview.  There are no grays or even light browns in his work.  He divides society into victims and oppressors and, just as we see every day on the talk shows, he pulls victims out of his hat and films confrontations with their accusers.  The result is a fruitcake drenched in emotional hysteria.\n\nThis film is a triumph of emotion over reason.  There are no facts except those that Moore can twist within the confines of his theories.  It is the glorification of the sixties ethos, ""The issue is not the issue.""  What else is there then?  When somebody is shot, it can never be a result of the shooter's emotional state, it must always be the fault of outside nefarious influences.  It was a nearby Lockheed-Martin plant that was to blame or a nearby plutonium plant or the towering shadow of the Air Force Academy.\n\nThe real monster ex machina in Bowling for Columbine is not a gun but another mechanism for self-defense known as the United States of America.  Moore regards us as being wholly inferior to other nations.  If only we could be more like Canada then our problems would be solved.  There, life is a socialist paradise.  People don't lock their doors and the criminals who enter only take a couple of things and then merrily go on their way.  The director knows this is the truth not through any statistical analysis but due to his interviews with adults in a Sarnia bar and with some kids outside a Taco Bell.  Why should he have to study the matter when such experts are readily available?  Anyway, Moore regards Ottawa's free health care system as the epitome of heaven on earth;  although he never inquires as to how long they have to wait for their MRIs or how many people there flood the borders whenever they experience a serious health crisis.  Canada's health care system is a joke and only a detached elitist like Michael Moore would be uneducated enough to regard socialism as being anything other than the acrid, gelatinous mess that it is.\n\nYet, for this viewer, there is nothing as foul and evil about Bowling for Columbine than its incessant race baiting.  A short cartoon tells the history of the United States and we discover that our past is merely one long parade of racism against blacks.  It's all whitey's fault.  There are no individuals on this earth, only varying hues of pigmentation.  One gets the feeling from his films that whenever he runs out of things to say that he decides to foment a race war.  As in Fahrenheit 9/11, his attempts to foster paranoia within the black community will likely never end.  He postulates that white fear is the motivating factor behind gun ownership.  Then he implies that the Second Amendment was written exclusively for the benefit of white men which is a blatant lie.  More canards are offered such as the risible claim that the NRA is the direct descendent of the Ku Klux Klan and that they, like the Klan, were formed to subjugate blacks.  That the first NRA President was a former Union General is an extraneous fact apparently.  Michael Moore is a man incapable of simply responding to what is so he must fabricate events in order to have anything meaningful to say about them.\n\nPersonally, I recommend seeing this film because conservatives in this country need to know what we're up against.  On display here is the soul of a truly sick man whom many of the young hail as a conquering hero.  Michael Moore is a racialist in the tradition of the Nazis, the Imperial Japanese, the Klan and the Black Panthers.  Like with many other leftists, racism is at the root of most of what he says.  To Moore, white is synonymous with evil and black is synonymous with good.  Whites fear blacks because we are all cowards; whereas all blacks are brave. Whites flee to the suburbs and hole up with their guns awaiting a siege.  So then what do we make of white people like me who live in the city?  What about all the black Americans who own guns?  Moore must attribute it to our false consciousness I suppose.  This filmmaker has nothing but disdain for his home state of Michigan, nothing but bile for his nation, and nothing but derision for those who share his skin color.  Bowling for Columbine is not a documentary.  It is a profile of an individual's inner-hate projected upon the world around him.";The Texture of Hate.
8;38.0;2.0;13.0;I have been a fan of Michael Moore for years, as his was a voice that was courageous and needed to be heard.  I have also been a supporter of conflict resolution strategies most of my life, always looking for ways to resolve issues without violence.  It is truly part of who I am.  As a former professor I have even taught graduate level courses on the topic.  I also know that what I taught I always tried to make part of my life, and remember how difficult that was, and how often I failed.\n\nBack to Bowling for Columbine, though this film made many good points, I believe Moore's conversation with Charleton Heston should not have taken place.  The discussion between the two of them, itself was violent as Moore's purpose was not to really hear Heston's point of view, but to ridicule him.  When will we learn that violence can be thrust on others through what we say -- our words, or our intentions to do harm, rather than help another.  So it is not just guns that can promote violence, it is us, especially our mouths which can be horrible weapons of violence and harm.\n\nPart of a conflict resolution program for children teaches kids appropriate ways to make their own points without violating the rights --  of others -- or said another way, without inflicting their own anger and violent energy upon others.  As I said, this is something to think about.  To me, this conversation undid what I think Moore wanted the film to do.;Something To Think About
274;39.0;1.0;29.0;"This documentary was completely disgusting. I don't think this man has any real convictions or respect for the subject matter he covers or for his audience. Everything he does and says is simply for effect.  There isn't a shred of integrity in his work.  It's not his ""opinions"" I'm attacking, I truly don't believe he has a single well-formed one.  He is entertaining now and then, but beyond his ability to make a clown out of himself, and those he interviews he has no merrit. He never makes a firm statement, only allusions.  He never approaches anyone in a straightfoward matter, but elbows his way into conversation with them and then cross examines them in a no-win fashion.

Especially ashamed for exploiting the tragic shooting of an innocent child.";A total farce

There are so many holes in his arguments, whole web sites are dedicated to exposing them. To wit:\n- Chartle Heston did not ""rush"" into either shooting location to host NRA meetings. The first in Columbine was scheduled a year in advance and after the shooting, all events except board of directors voting were canceled. The second ""rally"" was footage from a get out the vote meeting, not an NRA meeting.\n- Moore combined three Chartle Heston speeches, months after the Columbine shooting, to make him appear uncaring.\n- The Clan was formed in 1866, not 1871, the year the NRA was formed. The Clan being declared illegal in 1871 had nothing to do with the NRA.\n- Lockhead Martin manufacturing plan near Columbine does not produce ""weapons of mass destruction"" but rockets to launch satellites into space.\n- The opening plot of Moore getting a free gun from a bank was staged, as both New York state law, where Moore's from, and Michigan state law require a waiting period to aquire any fire arm.\nI could go on and on. How you people conintue to blindly quote the gospel according the Moore and ignore his long-since exposed lies is beyond me.\nAs for this movie, I will not see it after having sceptically read his ""Stupid White Men"" then saw all the holes poked through that. too. Wake up America. Moore hates this country, Bush even more, and will twist the truth to pull as many suckers into his fantasy world as possible.\nHate Bush if you must, just don't do so for the many inaccurate reasons that Moore gives.

349;41.0;5.0;29.0;"First of all, Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is not only about what happened in Littleton, Colorado, over 4 years ago. This controversial documentary only uses that event as an example of a notoriously unique aspect of the United States way of life: the huge number of firearms among common citizens, and the final results when you live in a society where media vehicles, to make money and get audience rates, insists in installing an overpowering fear through the population. Moore's intention with this award winning movie is to understand why this happens.\nAs a documentary written, directed and starred by a single person, of course it's subjective. Michael Moore tends to manipulate numbers and some facts to achieve his final goals. What is most interesting in "" Bowling for Columbine"" is the series of interviews with interesting people such as Marilyn Manson, Troy Parker and Charlton Heston, among others, and their opinions about the population having this huge amount of firearms close at hand.\nSo, watching  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is only Phase 1 of something everybody should know and care about. Phase 2 is to get more information about all the subjects and situations portrayed in the movie, and to decide how right (or how wrong) Moore is, and what should be done about the problem. Because, whatever the reasons, causes, etc., there surely is a problem. Moore only made it more explicit.\nGrade 9.0/10";If you play with fire...

287;43.0;2.0;28.0;"I know I'm gonna get dinged for berating this, but please hear me out.  I saw this movie with an open mind and afterwards, I did my research and found too many inconsistancies and falicies in Moore's movie Bowling for Columbine.\nFirst off, he doesn't cite any sources what so ever during the movie, in the credits, or anywhere else for that matter.  And in documentaries, you cite sources otherwise your ""facts"" and ""anecdotes"" are just another story.\nSeccond, I was not impressed with how pushy he was.  He came off as a jerk by pressing a mic right in front of Dick Clark's face without an appointment and expected an interview where and when he wanted knowing Clark would have to decline and would be in a hurry.\nHe also placed [a store] in a PR nightmare and exploiting the survivors of the shooting at Columbine to further his own agenda.  I think that is cold hearted and he does it on film!  Such [manipulation] and exploitation only made me more sick to my stomache, knowing Moore can go up to anyone, point a mic in front of their face and either make them do what he wants, or face the PR consequences.\nThird is his questionable ""facts.""  ...  This makes me take off a star because a documentary should have irrefutable facts, or claim them as theory, and since Moore did not state them as theory and his facts have inconsistancies so I'm very skeptical about his work.\nHowever there were some entertaining parts, like his humor.  I laughed a few times but it wasn't enough to make me like it.  All in all this movie is too questionable to be considered a work of art.";Entertaining, however info is extremely questionable

473;46.0;3.0;28.0;For a long time I've had a love/hate relationship with Michael Moore.  Meaning that I love his politics, but hate his methods.  This film left me in the same place all of his work does, wishing he could make any point without being self indulgent or bending the truth (Canadian authorities suspect him of falsifying the part of the movie where he buys ammunition from a Canadian Wal-Mart).\nOne of the things about Michael Moore that bothers me is his interview style.  When he talks to people he doesn't agree with he asks stupid passive aggressive questions that even a small child would be able to see through.  Then when they get defensive he acts all surprised and tries to condemn them even more in the viewers eyes.  Yet when he finds people he agrees with he's as soft as Oprah.  Whatever obvious personality flaws Charleton Heston may have, he isn't inarticulate. None the less he seemed to be next to the respectfully treated Marilyn Manson and Matt Stone.\nThe part of the film I was most annoyed by though was the bullet cartoon.  While the point that Americans are afraid of eachother and this may be one of largest contributers is well taken, the history of America it presents ranges from over simplified to blatently untrue.  Only the final thought of the connection between the NRA and KKK was of any real value.\nUltimately though the biggest flaw of the movie was it's lack of conculsions.  It put out lots of theories about the prevelence of gun violence in America, poverty, welfare reform, culture of fear, racism, the NRA, etc.  It compared gun violence in America to that of other western countries, Germany, France, England, and especially Canada.  It pointed out the silliness of the idea that America's violent history was to blame with these comparisons.  Yet it never tried to point out any other differences that set America apart.  No doubt that question was to big to give a definitive answer, but Moore didn't even try.;Thought Provoking but Inconclusive Documentary

Continually contradictory, the common thesis that the lack of social programs in this country contribute to gun violence.\nMichael Moore uses sappy music, and saavy editing to pull at the heartstrings while totally disregarding facts.\nOne such misleading fact is the number of gun murders he states.  While our gun deaths are much higher than countries like Germany, France, or Canada, it is actually smaller per capita according to FBI statistics.\nAlso, he takes only homicides for countries like Germany and Canada, but lumps justifiable shootings (cops shooting bad guys), and accidental deaths for the United States.\nHe blames the United State's welfare to work program for the shooting death of 8 year old Kayla Rolland by a classmate. He says the welfare to work program made the shooter's mother work, instead of stay home with her child.\nHe fails to point out that the boy lived in a known crackhouse, where numerous weapons were readily available along with drugs and passed-out drug addicts.\nThese are two of dozens of facts that mislead.

356;48.0;5.0;27.0;"In this work of genius, Moore perpetuates myths of gun control by staging phony scenes, distorting fact, splicing together video to alter meaning and context, and basically panders to the mindless sheep who cannot deal with real-world facts.

It's of course possible that gun owners are indeed the spawn of Satan, as the Left believes, but having to resort to portraying fiction as fact - such as his staged bank account gun acquisition and WalMart ammo purchase - seriously weakens his credibility. Not to mention the credibility of the clueless critics who applaud this film.\nOne of the more disturbing trends of this age is the sentiment, ""Sure, he may be lying, but his heart's in the right place.""

The per capita violent crime rate in all of those countries is far, far lower than America's. France alone would need another 1100 murders every year just to catch up with America on the per capita murder rate. Japan would need another 37,000 rapes just to keep up with our per capita rape rate. Germans would have to commit over 124,000 additional serious assaults on each other every year. No, we're not a violent society, at all. Germany and France are fairly equitable with us on theft, overall, but Mr. Moore wasn't investigating theft. He was investigating why we like to hurt each other, especially with guns.\nThank you, Mr. Moore for providing a rare, candid and thought-provoking analysis of why we do that. I cannot wait for the DVD to arrive. Seeing it once, twice or 100 times is not enough to remember the message this film conveys.;The Truth really IS out there
133;51.0;1.0;25.0;"For openers, allow me to point out a duly missed fact: Michael Moore is not a documentarian. He admits it himself. Though his movies contain facts (though they're overshadowed by preposterous lies), he intentionally spotlights his liberal views. These aren't unbiased facts. His films are the world viewed with a liberal agenda. Anyway, onto the film.\nAs overwhelming as some may find this film, this was no more than an exaggerated, overly hyped piece of crap that is meant to shake you up with facts when it's actually plagued with absurdity. For instance, Moore enters a bank that offers a rifle in reward for conducting business with it. In his depiction, he appears to walk in, open an account, and walk out with a firearm. But that is remarkably misleading. Moore actually had to wait for several weeks before that to apply for a weapon. As the law dictates, the bank underwent a thorough background check for at least three weeks. Although it may still very well be absurd that such a reward would be given, I found it odd how Moore had failed to put things into perspective.\nThe statistics are also unbeliavable. It's EXTREMELY unfathomable that Canada's annual homicides would be that low. Either the American death rate had to be inflated (though I seriously doubt it was) or, as I'm pretty damn confident they were, the Canadian rates were lowered.\nThe world needs to grasp that Michael Moore is a lying man. The guy publicly lied about being banned from the Jay Leno Show as well as the O'Reilly Factor, simply for the sake of promoting his image. The man is an opportunist, as well. Note that he was a card-carrying member of the NRA before he made ""Columbine,"" but chose to please the masses by putting this out.\nIn conclusion, the placement of a Columbine victim on Charlton Heston's doorstep is simply going too far.

Of course there are going to be a handful of negative reviews when some people are so willing to bend over backwards to find a problem with Michael Moore.\nThere are, however, also some very, very good reviews, and I would encourage visitors of amazon.com to consider the agenda of those people who have attempted to drive down sales of this item through negative feedback. Rather than encouraging people to become informed from a variety of ideological sources, conservatives have made it their mission to stiffle liberal ideas. I would personally suggest that you watch this movie and also read something like Ann Coulter's ""Slander,"" and then make up your own mind, rather than having it made up for you by a lack of information.\nAlso, to say that this film is ""liberal"" in the common sense of the term is a misrepresentation. In most ways it is liberal, except that it is a film about the dangers of gun violence and it quite specifically DOES NOT SUPPORT GUN CONTROL. I think that Michael Moore likely started filming with every intention of making a movie about the wonders of gun control, but what he found in his investigation steered him away from this ideology. This is a sign of the open-mindedness with which Mr. Moore approaches a liberal agenda. I was impressed to see one of the staples of liberal-dom, gun control, thrown out upon further investigation. Mr. Moore recognized that other concerns had more impact on the issues that he was discussing.\nAs to the meat of the film, it would be inappropriate to ruin anything specifically. Michael Moore's presentation of the issues is so ingenious that to hint at his method of approach would do the film a disservice. What I can say is that there is an animated history lesson that should be shown in every school, an interview with Charlton Heston that should be shown to every closet racist, and a segment about Canada that should encourage Americans to travel even in the face of SARS.\nThis is a fine film.

252;55.0;1.0;25.0;"I couldn't care less that Mr. Moore is anti-gun.  My advice to him would be to protest by not buying or possessing a firearm. What does bother me is his distorting, telling half-truths, his manipulating audio and video to make things appear truthful, and other times just flat-out lying to make others believe what he's presenting as fact.\nIn the ""film"", Moore attempts to portray the NRA (yes, I'm a proud, dues paying member) as cold and heartless for coming to Denver after the Columbine shootings for, as he puts it, a ""large pro-gun rally"". This is misleading. In fact, all rallies, dinners, sporting events, etc. were canceled out of respect for victims' families. The only thing that took place was an annual members' meeting which was required to be held under corporate law.  At the same meeting, Moore takes the snipets of a Charlton Heston speech and puts them in the order that he wants. Heston is reading a letter from the mayor of Denver asking that the meeting be cancelled. Heston is shown to reply, ""Don't come here?  We're already here."" Again, this is meant to make the NRA look defiant, cold, and heartless. However, Moore leaves out the part where Heston is saying that there are already scores of NRA members living in the Denver area. ""We're already here"", refers to them.  But playing the speech the way it was originally delivered doesn't make Heston look like a cold-blooded monster, so Moore had to make changes.\nThe next lie centers on the young girl that was shot near Flint, MI. Again, Moore states ""Just as he did after the Columbine shooting, Charlton Heston showed up in Flint, to have a big pro-gun rally."" Never one to leave out unimportant facts, Moore fails to mention Heston was in Flint eight months after the shooting for a ""get out the vote"" rally. Vice-President Gore was also in the area at that time for the same purpose but Moore apparently found that acceptable.\nThe cartoon comparing NRA members to KKK members is also pure nonsense. The NRA was founded in 1871 (five years after the KKK)by Union officers who were supportive of the rights of black citizens. In fact, eight of the first ten NRA presidents were former Union veterans including President U.S. Grant.  Teddy Roosevelt was also a life member.\nFinally, the interview with Heston in his home by Moore was particularly underhanded, in my opinion. Moore presents himself as an NRA life member, which helps him gain entrance into Heston's home. Perhaps Heston made a disagreeable comment or two, but Moore still takes advantage of a man in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Moore takes advantage of the fact that Heston has a foggy memory of the events by continuing to act as if Heston came to Flint soon after the six-year-old girl was shot. Just like his final act of placing the picture of the girl at Heston's door, the entire visit was a play for the cameras. Moore apparently has no shame.\nNo one was a bigger fan of Roger and Me when it was released and I enjoyed ""TV Nation"" when it played on NBC in the mid-90's. Moore showed that he genuinely knew about the topics in Roger and Me which concerned the loss of good manufacturing jobs and corporate greed. He should return to that theme if he has to lie to play the role of gun grabber.  Like I said before, Moore is entitled to his opinion about firearms or anything else. It doesn't bother me that he doesn't like guns. His attempts to influence others through lies and deception does.";He lied to further his own agenda.  It's as simple as that.
281;56.0;1.0;25.0;"This DVD was so full of lies and misrepresentation of facts, it's no wonder Mr. Moore has become the new golden child of the far-left; he fits right in with the crowd.  For example, he implies that the NRA's convention in Denver was scheduled after Columbine happened - the fact is that it was scheduled far in advance.  Mr. Moore completely ignores another fact:  Guns do not cause crime.  What causes crime is a decaying moral foundation, which is what we have here in America.  Guns have been widely available in this country for around 200 years.  There were no restrictive gun laws in place, and school shootings were unheard of - until around 15 years ago.  That's about the time when it became illegal to discipline your child, movies became more violent, and people have become more influenced by negative media (Marylin Manson, a has-been who makes an appearance in this DVD is one such example).  Mr. Moore misrepresents the NRA, attacks Charleton Heston (a man who obviously was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimers), and misses the point entirely:  Our violent media-driven culture has made people numb to the value of human life.  If guns didn't exist, murders would still occur (look at Japan, a country where guns are illegal and knife-murders make the headlines).  In contrast, look at Switzerland, where each household is REQUIRED to own a machine gun, and the murder rate is almost zero.  Where is this statistic in Mr. Moore's film?  By not addressing the root cause of violence, Michael Moore is part of the problem, not the solution.  This movie wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that people actually take him SERIOUSLY!  Well, since Rosie O'Donnell hit rock-bottom, the far-left needs another wealthy, lying loud-mouth to stir up the masses.  It's a shame that people like Mr. Moore have the silver screen to spread their propaganda, but fortunately the average American knows better and will dismiss this as being what it truly is: One man capitalizing off the tragedies of others.  God save us all.";Very convincing, until you examine the facts...
26;57.0;1.0;21.0;"I would say before I got involved in firearms, that I really didn't have much of an opinion on gun ownership. I figured what people did was their own business and that it didn't affect me.\n\nAs I started reading more into Columbine, I saw Michael Moores documentary called ""Bowling For Columbine"" and I had remembered seeing his film on Flint, Michigan when I was in highschool. I figured the documentary was going to be about Columbine, not about gun culture. Either way, the documentary started off pretty good and I couldn't really tell the direction it was headed. The direction of the film sounded like it was criticizing American culture rather than guns until the film compared us to Canada and the rest of the world how ""similar"" we were. The problem is, Moore makes the assertion that somehow Canada and the rest of the world are safehaven utopias where you can reside with your doors unlocked with a low number of murder statistics. What he fails to mention is the size of our country and many of the issues that are a result of it.\n\nTake in account Canada, a population of 32,984,700 in 2007. The US has a population of 302,213,000. Population wise, we are going to have more homocides. What Moore failed to state was that Canada while they may have gun registration is that before it was ever implented into Canada, the murder rates have been unchanged for the most part and crime has actually increased. Does this signify that guns were never the problem in Canada to begin with? The same applys for the United Kingdom, before handguns were outlawed, the murder rate and gun crime was actually lower than it is now. While the European nations may have supposed ""low"" murder rates, gun ownership rates really have nothing to do with it but rather what fuels violence.\n\nIn the US for example, much of our crime is black on black crime, gang warfare, the drug trade, and illegal aliens coming into this country. Actually 20 percent of our prison population are illegal aliens. The folks killing each other are not law abiding gun owners.\n\nMoore also fails to mention how some of the most violent nations are those that actually have some of the most strict gun control laws in effect. Mexico, South Africa, India, Russia all have much higher murder rates than our country yet they have very strict laws pertaining to who can actually have a gun legally.\n\nOverall the movie was nothing more than propaganda meant to look like a sceptical view of gun ownership. I was rather dissapointed with the film. I've watched it 3 different times to try and get an understanding from Michaels point of view but I think that the Bowling For Columbine dvd I purchased on ebay will make better use for skeet shooting.";Biased and dissapointing

109;59.0;1.0;23.0;So far as I can tell, there is not one compelling argument for gun control in this country.  Why do people in America kill each other more than in any other democratic country?  Culture.  Not the availability of guns.  In a culture that glorifies violence, where children are subjected to Classical and Operant conditioning to kill through movies and video games, we can hardly blame the weapons themselves.  What we really need is to curb our apetites for violence and our lack of empathy for our fellow man.\n\n  Jamaica, which has extremely strict gun laws, has roughly the same murder rate (per capita) as Los Angeles.  However, most of their murders are committed with edged weapons instead of firearms.  Why?  Could it be that a culture which devalues human life produces more people with a predisposition to sociopathic behavior?  Could it be that it is not the weapons themselves, but the way we raise our children?  Probably, but it is easier to blame the instrument than to blame ourselves.\n  Prohibition did nothing to curtail the use of alcohol.  Drug laws have not taken care of our drug problem.  In fact, one could argue that these laws have actually produced MORE crime by making otherwise law abiding citizens law breakers, and by creating huge crime syndicates dedicated to trafficking in illegal goods, with all of the violence that accompanies such organizations.\n  The average gun owner is an law abiding citizen who has gone through the proper channels to buy a gun, and who intends to use it for legal sporting or defensive puposes.  The average criminal has not obtained his/her gun in a legal manner, and doubtless uses it in illegal pursuits.  Turning a blind eye to this and screaming for gun control only takes the emphasis off of where the real problems lie.\n\n  As a gun owner, I am not angry about films such as Moore's.  Nor do I hate the man himself.  I think we are all shocked and appalled by events such as the killings in Columbine.  I sypathize with everyone who wants to put a stop to such events.  I just wish that we could focus on the real problem instead of going after a scapegoat.;Misguided at best

While the subject matter of the film is extremely serious, Moore manages to deal with it in a humoristic way, which does not derogates from the significance and importance of the movie.\nI have seen most of Moore's previous films, and while they were all excellent, this is his best work to date. I can only congratulate myself for living in the same period with such a bright, honest and patriotic person.\nIf only we had more Moores around, the world would be a much safer place.\nPlease buy the DVD, even if it's the only movie you're not renting this year - it's that important.;Perhaps the best film of the decade

319;63.0;2.0;23.0;"I gave ""Roger and Me"" 5 stars, but I think this is a much lesser effort from Michael Moore.\nFirst, here is what makes Roger and Me great: irony and tragedy in parallel.  Moore is a genius at putting people into ridiculously ironic situations - for example, filming four rich women golfers, none of whom have ever worked a day in their lives, calling the auto workers ""lazy"" as they take tee shots.  Ronald Reagan brings the workers out for pizza and advises them to move to Texas, and then leaves without picking up the tab.  As Roger Smith, CEO of GM, makes a Christmas speech, fired auto workers are evicted from their homes.  The movie makes its point in a roundabout way that works with people across the ideological spectrum - and still leaves plenty of room for debate.\nBowling for Columbine is a different story.  There's still some of Moore's irony left, as when James Nichols (Terry's brother) says ""there's some wackos out there!"" after pointing a gun at his head and convincingly sounding wacko himself.  And the Lockheed Martin exec standing in front of a gigantic missile as he discusses how anger management would have helped with Columbine.  But here Michael Moore tries to find a solution to the problem of violent crime in the US.  It seems for a while that the solution is going to be, ""restrict guns,"" and the evidence is rather convincing.  Until Moore reveals that Canada has relatively unrestricted access to guns, but a tiny fraction of the US's murder rate.\nAfter this, the movie seems to go off in too many directions.  If this is true about Canada, why is Moore intent on stopping the sales of handgun ammo at K-Mart?  He never explains (although I think there could be a plausible case).  He ties American violence to a ""culture of fear"" spread by the American media.  But this seems no more convincing than the idea that Marilyn Manson is spreading violence through similar media, and the theory that American media is so much more fear-driven than Canadian media seems doubtful.  The movie ends with Moore speeding through many more unconvincing and irrelevant theories: about ""Cops"" being racist, about workfare causing an accidental shooting, etc.  Bowling for Columbine simply doesn't have the irony and dark humor of Roger and Me, and spends too long on unconvincing solutions.  Moore makes a weak attempt to substitute Charlton Heston for Roger Smith, but winds up making the old man look sympathetic with his relentless badgering.  Moore comes off looking as simple-minded as those who would criticize him: his solutions are no better thought through than his opposition's.";"It sure isn't ""Roger and Me"""
354;64.0;5.0;23.0;I think people in the United States have been brainwashed since they were little to believe they are superior to everyone else in the world.  They refuse to realize how messed up this country really is.  Michael Moore does a great job of depicting primitiveness of such people with irony and sarcasm.  He describes how United States has manipulated and bullied the whole world for its own personal gains and still continues to do so.;GREAT MOVIE
87;65.0;4.0;22.0;Love him or hate him, Michael Moore does know how to tweak the nerves of the American conciousness.\n\nBowling for Columbine is an EXCELLENT examination of the American gun culture of fear, and how we are in greivous danger of imploding on ourselves and becoming our own worst enemy.  From Moore's trip to a bank where he gets a free gun for opening an account (I am NOT kidding), to his interview with Charleton Heston, Moore isn't afraid to expose the freakishly paranoid nature of our society and how it creates the majority of our crime.\n\nI especially liked his forray into Canada, and the spotlight on our different cultures, which would seem very similar.  Boy, are they not!\n\nMoore also takes on the media, which sensationalizes the fear factors that are so pervasive in our society.  It's a great film to make you re-evaluate how you get your daily dose of news in the world, and I guaruantee that you will never watch a news-broadcast the same way again after viewing this film.\n\nA truly great work that deserved the attention and accolades it got.  Not at all a waste of time or money.;Very Good, harsh look at American Society
384;66.0;5.0;23.0;"Bowling for Columbine is one of the greatest films of all time.\nThoughtful and provacative, it traces the tragedy that struck our entire nation.  It combines humor, wit, and boldness to ask the question of why such a tragic event as the Columbine shootings occurred.\nI wish to respond to some of the reviews I read regarding this film, particularly the scathing and unartful ones, in defence of Moore's work.\nFirst, the claim made by one reviewer stating that he/she ""couldn't put [his] finger on what Michael Moore's argument was after [he] was done watching"" brings to question whether it is a problem with Moore's argument or, more likely, if it has something to do with this reviewer's ability to follow the ideas that the film presents.  In no way does Moore claim authority over the issues at hand; rather, he presents a situation with facts that are otherwise unknown or glossed over by mainstream media.  His main intent is not to solve the ongoing problem of violence in America, but instead is to provide insight to the possible CAUSES that led up to the unnecessary violence involving these young Americans on such a large scale.\nThe beauty of this film is its activism through Moore's uncanny humor and trademark sarcasm.  The scene showing the 9-11 movie footage with Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" playing in the background is precisely Moore's style of ironic and thought-provoking presentation.  By combining these two drastically contrasting elements, Moore's intelligent audience is able to see the similarly contrasting aspects of the gilted ""American Dream"" versus what is real and wrong about the United States.\nThe fact that K-Mart sold bullets to the Columbine shooters is clearly an aspect that something is terribly wrong with society.  The same reviewer who couldn't follow Moore's ""argument"" wrote that ""the two Columbine victims confronting K-Mart headquarters felt as if it was all Moore's planning.  They just didn't seem like the type who would've gone on this thing on their own.""  Aside from the fact that this very offensive comment is an attack on the victims, it is obvious that these high school students would probably not have, in fact, confronted K-Mart.  Not only have they been drastically impaired physically (wheelchair, bullets in body), but these boys are clearly in no mental nor emotional state to dive into a conflict between a huge corporation like K-Mart alone.  This is where Moore comes in.  He is the facilitator of these young victims who would otherwise have voice in the issue.  Through his gift of film, he gives these boys a chance to challenge a monstrous corporation's business ethics, to aid in preventing another tragedy (the first of which should not have occurred in the first place), and to know that they are capable of making a difference.\nAlthough there are many more comments reviewers have made that I feel are rash and unjustified, the one last statement that i will tackle is the one that states, ""I've read that in the last few years violent crime in the U.S. is down 20%, while media reporting of crime is up 600%.  This 'documentary' goes a long way to increase that kind of imbalance...""  Bowling for Columbine?  I question whether this particular comment is about the same film that I am defending.  Moore is clearly arguing the first half of this person's statement, which is obviously why he concludes that fear is one (perhaps the most prominent) of the underlying causes of violence in America, as the South Park clip comically illustrates.  As for the film increasing the imbalance, I think it does quite the opposite by comparing U.S. news, with its constant emphasis on street crimes and violence (not to mention the lack of awareness regarding white-collar crime) to Canadian news, with the example of its special report on new speedbumps.  Moore brings up issues of violence not to increase fear and anxiety as mass media such as the U.S. news often does, but to simply take these issues and seek ways in which we as Americans can work to solve them in creative, non-violent methods.\nAll in all, Bowling for Columbine is an honest film by a man who recognizes the injustices that individuals suffer from because of the many rotten holes in society where the rich (and the big bad corporations) can get away with virtually anything.  Through this and all of his other films, he criticizes capitalism and avidly fights for the rights of the individual.  He proves that one man can truly make a difference and that it can happen through means other than violence.";"A Defence of ""Moore""esy"

300;68.0;5.0;21.0;"First, let me say that Bowling for Columbine is one of the most engaging movies I've seen in a while. As someone who has grown up thirty minutes from Moore's hometown of Flint, I have always had an affinity with Michael Moore's work, but Bowling for Columbine strikes me as far superior to anything this director has done before.\nBowling for Columbine, though it definitely has an agenda, strikes me as being more even-handed than Moore's previous film and television work. I loved Roger & Me, but Bowling for Columbine is so much broader in its scope and reasoned in its execution.\nMoore does not, as some have suggested, slam or use the ""tactics of guerrilla journalism"" on the people who come off looking really bad (James Nichols, Lockheed Martin, Charleton Heston) in this film. He hands them the rope of his questions and lets them hang themselves with their own words and actions.\nBowling for Columbine's simple documentation speaks more eloquently about the state of American politics than the hundreds of schills and pundits on the evening news. In Bowling for Columbine one can visibly see America's descent from freedom and liberty into a state of fear and despair.\nAs much as I love my home state (Michigan--which comes off very poorly in this film) and my country, Bowling for Columbine makes one thing crystal clear: it is time for a change. The politics of hope and reason must win the day against George Bush and the politics of fear and death.\nI give Bowling for Columbine a FULL five stars.";It is time
302;69.0;1.0;21.0;"When many people hear the term, ""documentary,"" they assume that the film is absolutely factful and truthful, thanks in part to the excellent efforts of The History Channel.  But, in this case, I think those people have been duped.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" deals with an issue that is so large and complex that it cannot be successfully dealt with in a movie of any length.  There are so many variables involved in gun violence that any gun-control documentary must delete, generalize or distort the information beyond accuracy, truthfulness and usefulness to society.  Consider just a small sampling of the possible variables that an accurate, reproducible scientific study would have to include:\n1) population density (urban vs. rural areas-many more people own guns in rural areas, yet most gun-violence occurs in the metropolitan areas)\n2) racial/ethnic violent crime rates (most gun violence is due to underage gang bangers from black, latino and other minority ethnic groups)\n3) the effect of literally thousands of different gun control laws affecting thousands of jurisdictions (walk from one city to the next and the gun control laws change--what effect does this have on criminals?)\n4) gender/age/income differences in the crime rates (lower income young black males are the most violent, upper income elderly white females the least violent)\n5) ownership/legality of weapons used (most gun crimes are committed by repeat offenders with stolen guns)\n6) what about the estimated 2 million times a year guns are used to prevent crimes?\nand the list goes on--any documentary that addresses gun control accurately and truthfully would literally be years long!\nMichael Moore, in order to add more emotional influence to his documentary, selectively presented just a tiny fraction of the variables involved in studying gun control, just to support his particular point of view.  Think about it--Charlton Heston is only one person (a leading figure of a large organization); he in no way is an accurate statistical representation of the millions of gun-owners (law-abiding and criminal) in America.  Likewise, a few striking examples of gun violence--no matter how tragic--aren't enough to draw an accurate conclusion about this huge issue.  This is unacceptable behavior from a documentary maker and does a great injustice to the now-misinformed people of America.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is the sort of emotionally-charged fluff that is perfect for the outspoken rabidly-anti-gun Hollywood elite to use to strengthen their unscientific point of view.";not all documentaries are scientific--this one is proof

It made it seem like Littleton was just a place where they hash out war machines leaving children to face some Lord Of The Flies like reality. It made it seem as if Lockheed Martin made the town into some kind of Hans Scorpio evil village. It's not like that at all, it is one of the few suburbs where you can see children playing in the street and if anything would be a Stepford Wives like community if put in a negative light. You don't see missles passing by on the highway like he claims, and the stuff about NORAD and the Air Force Academy affecting the way people in Littleton think is rediculous.

THAT ISN'T EVEN CLOOOOSSEEE to how it was. Kids who listened to Marylin Manson and KMFDM were taken a back by this so much that they wouldn't broadcast that they liked them because there was the inevitable witch hunt that proceeded the events. Nobody would have purchased tickets that soon, no concert promoter would TOUCH a Marylin Manson concert at that time. I've noticed in all of his documentaries he capitalizes on poor decisions made right after troubling and confusing events, waits until everyone forgets and then swoops in. In the first few days after 9/11 people were acting very irrationally, which is 100% natural given the onset confusion and hostility that comes from that. I will let anyone who didn't feel any sorrow, any hostility, and any fear cast the first stone if you disagree. You can't film drunken guys at a bachelor party and say that's the kind of people they always are.

89;72.0;1.0;20.0;"At first glance, this ""documentary"" seems very thought-provoking... until you take the time and view it again and, look into the facts. In the beginning, we're shocked to see Moore open a CD in a bank and walk out with a gun. Truth is, there was a background check and a waiting peroid; he couldn't literally walk out with a gun. Later, we see a hateful smear campaign against the NRA and Charlton Heston in particular. Moore shows us the aftermath of the Columbine killings interspersed with a defiant Heston coming to Denver to rub the NRA in Colorado's face. Again, this isn't true. If you look carefully at Heston, you'll see he's wearing different clothes during the same speech. The truth is, the NRA cancelled all of their events in Colorado after Columbine except for the board meeting which they had to hold there due to legal reasons. Furthermore, Heston's speech is actually from a speech he made in Charlotte, NC long after Columbine. Moore goes on to imply that the KKK and the NRA are one in the same. Once again, this isn't true. Both organizations were founded at different times and Charlton Heston was a personal friend of Martin Luther King and played a role in the civil-rights movement. Other lies in this movie are Heston rushing in after the shooting death of a young schoolgirl to hold an NRA rally. Yep, you guessed it, the dates don't coincide. The lies mount and mount so I won't ramble on with all of them but I will point out the end where Moore interviews Heston. If you look carefully at the clock in Heston's house, you'll see that the time-lapse is 20 minutes. The interview itself last somewhere around 5 minutes. So, what did Moore edit and splice together to make Heston sound like a hateful, insensitive man? Too bad Mr. Heston has Alzheimers and can't tell his side of the story. It's also too bad that Moore won such acclaim for this ""documentary."" This isn't a documentary, it's mean-spirited, slanderous, revisionist history.";Slanderous trash

Rather, it's a propoganda piece, a kind of cinematic grinding axe, wherein Moore launches into soft-spoken yet clearly enraged tirades against a range of targets, capping it all off with an ambush on Charlton Heston.

315;79.0;1.0;20.0;"Other then a headache and a mild sense of bewilderment, the only thing I got from Bowling for Columbine is a sense that Michael Moore is a huckster and a shameless self-promoter.\nWhile trying to verify some of Moore's facts, I became confused as to whether Bowling is supposed to be taken as a serious documentary or a psuedo-docu-comedy (PDC).  And, having seen both documentaries and PDC's I'm not even sure Bowling is either one of those.  I'm not even sure it can be called a film, unless you go with the  ""to become coated or obscured"" definition.\nBowling's greatest weakness is a lack of focus.  In both documentaries and PDC's, there is generally one subject or a group of subjects connected by a common event/experience/belief.  If Bowling has a subject, I would guess it has to be Moore.  Unfortunately, Michael Moore is not a very interesting subject and nowhere near as witty as he must think he is.\nMoore spends the running time aimlessly wandering between Flint MI, Columbine CO, and L.A. CA.  He seems to focus on gun violence and the question of why so many American's kill other Americans (presumably with guns, but it never clearly established if Moore is talking about murder in general or murders involving guns).\nRandom facts are thrown at the viewer presumably in support of whatever Moore's argument is. Or maybe its just to throw random facts and the audience.\nIt could just all be the white man's fault.  In fact, a short cartoon blaming white male Puritans for slavery, the KKK, the NRA, and the current murder rate in the U.S. (once again, presumably gun related murders) is about the only coherent part of this mess.  In fact, I think this cartoon short is the only thing that qualifies as a film in the ""movie"" sense of the word.  Anyway, white men are blamed for slavery, U.S. white men in particular, and no mention of any other country's involvement in the slave trade is made.  It is not even mentioned that slavery is still going on today.  Black on black slavery in Sudan and all kinds of sex slavery all over Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\nMoore does have a point on how the U.S. news media and politicians scare the American public into a state of learned helplessness, and he claims the same is not true in Canada or Europe, but he never goes anywhere with this point.  Maybe a simple comparison of the U.S. and Canadian constitutions and the role the press is given by each might have been instructive, but Moore, in his eagerness to blame America first, never takes the opportunity.\nThe movie is called Bowling for Columbine but the only thing documented is Moore's, and by extension, the U.S. left's descent into bitterness and schizophrenia.  The only true highlight is an edited and all too brief clip of South Park:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.\nIf this is the best argument the facist/socialist factions living in the U.S. can make for gun control, then Americans will be bearing arms for a long, long time.  If there's some other argument being made here, good luck in finding it.\nI give Bowling for Columbine 1/2 star for the inclusion of the South Park clip which helped me to remember that there was a reality outside of Bowling for Columbine.";Is it a documentary or a psuedo-documentary/comedy?
343;80.0;5.0;20.0;"Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Moore, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE fully deserves its Best Documentary Oscar. In fact, I'll admit that before I even watched this, I just presumed Moore was some pudgy idiot and wasn't expecting much given his ""Shame on you Mr Bush!"" comments. The spirit of Jane Fonda sadly isn't gone. I could just imagine Dubya sitting in front of the TV in the White House, watching the Oscars. After thinking a couple of minutes, he turns to the First Lady with a puzzled look and says ""Uh, Laura; honey. Was that chubby guy talkin' 'bout ME or 'bout DADDY? Maybe I'd better ring Mom.""\nBut of course it was stupid & naive of me to approach my review in this manner. I may be a self-proclaimed ""vidiot"", but I'm a person who actually SITS DOWN AND WATCHES movies before I review or moan about them.\nBOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a doco everyone should watch. It's by turns biting, acerbically funny, disturbing, provocative, challenging & sobering.\nPractically right off the bat, Moore goes into a bank with a hidden camera to open an account. As a token of their appreciation he is given a free gun! They may as well hang a sign in their window saying ""PLEASE ROB US!"". Ironically we later learn the fact that Moore won an NRA marksman award as a teen. Is this irony? Or hypocrisy?\nEarly on I remembered Charles Bronson's line in DEATH WISH 5: ""Guns have their uses. IDIOTS with guns make me nervous."" I felt that since the right to bear arms is in the U.S Constitution, no one should have the authority to impose their will upon others and violate those rights. Admittedly it's different in NZ, where gun laws are stricter: If an intruder broke into my house I would probably be forced to clock him on the head with my 2"" thick Leonard Maltin Movie Guide a few times and hope it works out in my favor.\nBut check this out. Interviewed here are:\n1. A Guy with an ""Anarchist Cookbook"" on how to make bombs & napalm among other things. (I'm not THAT kind of anarchist!)\n2. Another guy who sleeps with a loaded gun under his pillow. Constitutional right? Or just bloody daft?\n3. Moore's visit to Lockhead Martin- the World's largest weapons manufacturer. One of their officials is interviewed standing in front of a nuclear warhead and saying he's not doing anything wrong. This guy even goes so far as to say that Columbine-style killings happen all around the World every day. That's totally f***ed up. I must be reading the wrong newspapers.\nOther gems among BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE's many highlights is the finale where Moore goes one on one with Charlton Heston, who held a gun rally before the dust had settled on the Columbine Massacre, which makes his battle cry of ""From my cold dead hand!"" all the more disturbing.  Heston also admits to leaving loaded guns lying around his house where his grandkids can get at them. His feeble assertion is ""They know not to touch"". How did this guy win an Oscar? Heston winds up looking like a right plonker in the end.\nAlso interviewed are Marilyn Manson, who channelled his demons into music; & South Park co-creater Matt Stone, who worked his frustration at growing up in a small town into comedy; as opposed to them shooting up their schools. While we're on that subject, there's a frightening clip of a schoolkid  pulling A DOZEN guns he's had concealed in his baggy pants. Jeez!\nMeanwhile, all the bible thumpers are blaming cartoons, Satan, toys, heavy metal, movies (!SPCS!) and Marilyn Manson (Who is actually a very intelligent guy. Maybe HE should run for President?). These clowns are just bad[].\nThere's also a funny animated sequence about the pilgrims & linking the NRA to the KKK, slavery and witch hunts.\nWhile watching this I found within my personal views conflicting ideals. And yes, I'll openly admit a little hypocrisy. At least I can admit it. BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is a movie that can be dissected and analysed and interpreted in countless different ways. So that's a good thing, right? And Chuck Heston should really be tipping his toupe to Moore. There's no denying the man has guts. An absolute must see.";Funny, thought provoking, challenging. An instant classic.
352;81.0;4.0;20.0;"There is no such thing as an unbiased documentary; indeed the less biased a documentary appears, then the more suspicious I am of it. Michael Moore can be insensitive, even cruel, as he most certainly is to Charlton Heston in this film, but I never doubt where he stands. I didn't get the impression that Heston ""caused"" Columbine, rather that Michael Moore, an NRA member, was chastising Heston for HIS insensitivity in holding NRA rallies in towns still affected by school massacres.\nYou make a very important point in your review: ""The question should not be how did they get the guns, but why did they use them?"" and indeed the story of ""Bowling for Columnbine"" essentially concerns Michael Moore's attempt to answer that question. He ultimately comes to the conclusion that it is NOT the easy availability of guns that drove these kids to mass murder, but the harsh, competitive, alienating nature of American life. Columbine High School is described by one of its graduates (Trey Parker) as a living nightmare of degredation, threats malaise. A little boy would not have killed a little girl, he reveals, if his mother had been there to monitor him, instead of having to work two jobs and take an hours-ling bus ride to and from work. Moore also makes great play of the fact that Columbine manufactures the missiles with which America bombs civilians in other countries without warning.\nThe film's principle flaw, and what has opened it to its detractors, is that Moore's centrepiece ""stunts"" (the Kmart protest, the Heston interview) appear to advocate gun control, when ""Bowling for Columbine"" isn't really about gun control at all, but an examination of the collective psychology of America.";A response to the viewer below

The worst part of this movie is that people with above average intelligence are sucked into believing what they are told in the movie.  I think that the man would have better luck in politics as he is very good at spreading his ignorance.  Every bit of the way through this movie I found myself arguing with the TV and disproving, on my limited knowledge of the situations in question, almost every comment he made.  Further while he comes off as very convincing, many should notice that he never really comes to a point, he is merely preaching to hear himself talk. I would suggest watching this movie but only for the thought of knowing what you are talking against when a Michael Moore fan tries to spout some of his mind rotting views.";Do you consider yourself intelligent?

Yes, all guns should be properly secured, and people who leave them improperly stored and an accident happens should be punished...\nBUT WHAT ABOUT THE OWNERS OF 5-GALLON BUCKETS!!!\nSimilarly, we have a newsmedia that preys on catastrophe. The truth is that in the last 5 years, there have been more killings by guns in schools in Europe than in the US. Some countries outlaw guns all together, while others have very strict laws and procedures to go through. Yet more children are killed there than here, but this fruitcake of a grandstanding filmmaker doesn't tell the whole truth.\n""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""\nThat's not a collective right, it's an individual right. No amount of bad press, media grandstanding, or stupid moviemaking will ever change that.

120;84.0;1.0;19.0;If you don't question at least some of the conclusions Moore draws in this film, you might as well stop reading now.  It's no secret that Moore has an agenda, whether you agree with the message of not.  If you'd like to educate yourself on facts, or at least be able to address actual factual information, I strongly recommend ' More Guns Less Crime', by John Lott.  He has compiled 20 years worth of statistical data from every county in the United States concerning gun related crime, as opposed to Moore's exploitation of one sad day of our history, and a series of out of context quotes by NRA members, compiled not to enhance facts, but rather to ensite hatred.\nIf you want drum-beating, liberal sensationalism, watch Moore.  If you want facts, read Lott.;Doctored Documentary
277;85.0;1.0;19.0;Bowling for Columbine is a low brow, offensive propaganda piece and is an affront to real documentary film makers. Moore uses lies, half-truths and selective editing to twist reality into what he thinks is the truth.;This is NOT a documentary by any stretch of the imagination
50;86.0;1.0;18.0;"I saw this movie in order to understand what the buzz was about and was thoroughly disgusted.  This film is nothing but clever editing with a whole lot of social scapegoating.  It's laughable seeing Michael try to pin the blame possibly on the  Lockhill-Selma plant in town.  As for the reviewer who said that the spokesman was standing right in front of a nuclear warhead, you should check your facts.  It was revealed that the plant in question in town was building rockets to launch T.V. Satellites into space.  Don't take my word for it, check up on the facts.  Moore's butchering of history is itself hysterical in the short animated segment where he tries to portray the country of England that the Puritans fled from as being benevolent and even worse where he portrays the Ku Klux Klan and NRA being the same organization, simply because both come up after the civil war.  Anyone who checks up on history knows that the NRA was founded by former Union officials to improve marksmanship.  Just go read the books Negroes With Guns and Radio-Free Dixie.  If one doesn't know their facts or history, than that's forgiveable, but the fact that this film won so many awards is not forgiveable when you take into account the manipulative editing.  He asks a Michigan Militiaman about why not using non-violent resistance, only to have the guy reply, ""I've never heard about that before"".  Yet you don't actually see Michael Moore on screen at all, so for all you know he could have asked a different question and then insterted himself in the editing room asking the question about non-violent resistance.  The opening scene with him at the bank is so obviously screwy as he asks the worker if it's a little dangerous handing a gun out at a bank, yet cuts it before the worker has a chance to answer.  The splicing together of different segments of different speeches from Charlton Heston using protest footage to hide the switch is also quite useful to sway the gullible non-critical viewer.  Notice how Charlton Heston's tie-color changes at one point even.  Also the point near the end where he shows up the photo of the little girl who was killed.  Moore insisted that he used two cameras (hence the switch in perspectives) yet when the perspective changes you don't see the other cameraman who should be there.  There should be one to the left of Moore and in front of him.  Yet you don't ever see them, which is impossible unless Moore lied and basically used just one cameraman to film two different segments (one before and one after Charlton Heston left) along with two different vocal tracks (one of the reasons for shooting behind Michael Moore is so that you don't see Moore's face and mouth from behind).  Those points are just the tip of the iceberg.  When it comes to statistics, Moore never tells where he got them or mentions the difference in populations between the U.S. and other countries.  Add to that just many editing tricks that are so obvious to anyone that thinks for themself and doesn't just buy into Moore like some dittohead.";So blatantly manipulatively edited

While most of us academics take refuge in ""multi-factor"" analyses, Moore really brings guns & media & fear & culture (N.B. not just guns) to the fore in this trademark in-your-face documentary. While I admire the dry, honest thoroughness of researchers like John Donahue and Ian Ayers, and enjoy the fighting if dishonest spirit of John Lott-Rosh, I think Moore will have a much larger effect on publicizing arguments about public policy. These debates have always been hot rather than ""bright"" (excepting Donahue et. al.) and Moore brings both heat and light.";Not just guns, but media, culture, etc.
110;90.0;2.0;18.0;"I give Moore 2 stars, as opposed to 1, only because I recognize his mastery of the fictional documentary genre.  Some of what he says in this film are outright lies; for instance, the Lockheed weapons factory he visits in Colorado makes satellite missiles, not arms to be used to blow up our ""innocent"" enemies, as Moore would have us believe.  Still, his greatest gift -- if one can call it that -- is his ability to frame a story in such a way as to create a deliberately false impression without having to tell any actual lies.  A perfect example of this is the ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence in which Moore castigates America for all of the horrible, international atrocities it has committed in the last half century, while conveniently omitting the type of information that might give a more realistic account of these supposedly heinous incidents.\n\nMoore's depictions of Canada, Charlton Heston, and the NRA are likewise misleading.  Our neighbors to the North are living in a virtual crime-less utopia, if one is to buy into the claims of this film.  However, there is evidence to suggest that violent crime is actually on the rise in many areas of Canada, but I suppose it's silly of me to expect facts like this to show up in a ""documentary.""  The portrayal of Heston, on the other hand, is damn near libelous.  Yes, Heston held an NRA meeting in Colorado soon after the Columbine tragedy.  What Moore fails to inform his viewers is that this meeting had been scheduled years in advance, long before the school shooting, and that the official part of the meeting could not be cancelled due to the NRA's own by-laws.  Most of the events that had been planned in connection with this meeting were, in fact, cancelled.  Though Heston did speak at the one event that wasn't cancelled, he did not utter his famous ""from my cold dead hands"" remark in this speech, but instead delivered that gem in a speech a year later.  Moore creates the phony impression that Heston callously said this at the Colorado meeting right after the Columbine tragedy, thus revealing Heston's cold indifference to the suffering that had occurred.  As I said before, I guess I shouldn't expect the facts to get in the way of a good story, or precious propaganda for that matter.\n\nMoore's contention that the media spend a great deal of their time drumming up irrational fear is actually on target; not realizing the value of a consistent theme, though, Moore obsessively harps on American violence so much that a thoughtful viewer is likely to wonder if perhaps some of the fear being drummed up by the media isn't that irrational after all.  In the end, however, the main lessons are clear: Canada is heaven, America is hell, and Charlton Heston is Satan.";Pure, Unadulterated Propaganda

485;92.0;5.0;19.0;This film wasn't playing in the town where I live so I drove three hours to a city where I could see it.  It was certainly worth the trip.  Michael Moore's gift for telling it like it is, abundantly evident in this film, was my incentive for traveling that distance and he did not let me down. This two hour documentary film focuses primarily on the peculiar culture of fear that our government and our media have fostered that makes Americans feel the need to keep everything under constant vigilance, secured by locks, keys, and cameras, armed and at the ready for defense.  It focuses on our culture of mistrust and violence.  It shows how painfully shut off from each other we are, as well as how little responsibility we take for the well-being of each other.  It shows a shocking level of ignorance, the ugly stepsister of fear. It is done in Moore's characteristic satirical style and so it is very funny, even entertaining in spots, but it also has heaping measures of his bold, straight-forward questioning of the status quo.  He takes on the NRA as well as several corporate and government programs.  He talks with gun thieves, the Michigan Militia, Terry Nichols' brother James, Charleton Heston, and for the voice of reason, Marilyn Manson. He includes some very shattering footage of the legacy of guns we have turned upon our international neighbors, sometimes ousting freely elected leaders to set up dictators and murderers, as well as siting statistics in terms of body count that these tactics have created.  We squirm in our seats as chilling footage of the legacy of fear trickles hideously down to our children.  We grimace with shame and disgust at the small-minded, ignorant, and painfully narrow viewpoints of our own elected officials, law enforcement, media, and corporate people.  Numerous comparisons are made of other countries around the world with similar backgrounds to ours who do not have thousands and thousands of killings from guns every single year. We stand alone as gun-toting killers.  There are some bright spots that show how ordinary citizens can change this climate of fear and senseless, irrational defensiveness that were encouraging.\n  This film is asking us to stop and take a look with common sense and recognize that Chicken Little might have it wrong...maybe the sky is not falling...maybe we don't need to be armed to the teeth.  As with all of Moore's books and films, regardless of your own political viewpoint, you are bound to come away from this film with plenty of food for thought.  You will be asked to pull your head up out of the sand for a couple of hours and take a good look at yourself, our leaders, your future and the future of our country.

The film/documentary basically puts forward the question - are Americans nuts about guns, or just plain nuts? Moore's film would point to the latter, and it's not without its reasons. America has by far the highest toll of gun deaths for a Western country per year, 11,000+ as the documentary explains compared to the few hundred by the next highest ranking country. The average viewer would quickly come to the conclusion that it is because America has so many guns, but this view is challenged when Moore points out that Canada has seven million guns in ten million families, but ""only"" a few hundred deaths each year.\n'Bowling for Columbine' focuses on the 1999 Columbine school shootings and the death of a six year old girl to form the basis of the documentary's questions. He also takes a look at the culture of fear that has been created by the American media and its victimisation of African Americans. Two of the documentary's highlights are the acts of America's foreign policy, played ironically to Satchmo's 'What a Wonderful World', and a cartoon explaining the brief history of the USA, which while simplistic, is certainly funny. And not to be forgotten, of course, is the interview with Charlton Heston. Moore lays into him like a ton of bricks and ends up making Heston look like what he is - a gun toting, far right fanatic with no moral basis for his beliefs. Well done Moore for exposing this!\nOne slight drawback of the documentary I felt, was how Moore seemed to present America as a land where guns rule and killings occur throughout it, but having been to America and having many friends who are American, I know for a fact this is not true. It obviously varies from place to place, which Moore didn't seem to explain.\nAs many critics have claimed, the low point of the documentary is Moore's failure to come up with an answer to his question. This is true, but I think the words of a review I recently read in the newspaper sums it up well - ""While Moore may not provide any conclusive answers to the questions he poses, in a world where people are too afraid to question anything, at least he's asking them"".\nAs the for the question Moore posed, that being why America has so many gun deaths compared to other western countries, I have come up with a view, which may or may not be correct. Ever since the Pilgrims arrived in America in the sixteenth century, Americans have constantly moved west to find new land. Because of this, they moved so quickly that often they had no governing body to restrict their actions, so people took matters into their own hands.

Do keep in mind that this is actually a documentary, and yet, it keeps putting up incredible numbers at the box office.\n  In Europe, 5 weeks after its release you still had to call to reserve tickets for it, as it was sold out everywhere! For a documentary?? Now why would that be?\n  Michael Moore takes the issue of guns in America and puts it in its true -gigantic- proportions. Most would (????) see that guns in america perpetuate the violence. But would they be able to connect the dots, or, would they know even where the dots are? Michael Moore not only does, but he does so with  astonishing humor in an age where political correctness ""rules"".\n  Moore sets out in America interviewing scores of people about the gun issue and he manages to bring out everything else that lies behind it: the arms industry and how it massively influences american politics (especially foreign politics), the politicians and their ties to the forementioned industry, the impact on the social web, and the downright insanity of american politics in general.\n  If a country has over 11.000 people (yes, the figure you read is correct) dead per year due to gun shot wounds while NOT being in some kind of (official) civil war or isn't attacked by someone then this country is dealing with a severe problem.\n  The director poses the questions and because he often poses them to people who ARE part of the problem he doesnt always get the answers from them but he does achieve something way more effective: he lets you, the viewer, see the answer(s) for yourself.\n  For the millions of Americans who have been victimised by the culture of daily fear promoted by the media (incredibly depicted here) this will be somewhat of a shock as the only person besides Moore who makes sense in the film is Marilyn Manson when he gets interviewed about Columbine!!! Ah, Manson, and of course one of the two creators of South Park (also interviewed).\n  Speaking of which, you get a 5 minute cartoon on American History which contains more truth than possibly all the school books you've read together on the subject multiplied by a 1000.\n  The true art here is that Moore lets people speak for themselves on an issue they think they understand and yet they make fools of themselves because they obviously don't - or, have no intention to-... The parts where the NRA is concerned are sheer gems.\n  Some people said that this astonishing documentary didn't provide ""answers"". I do believe these people were either not watching or saw some other film.

What  more could the director do? Publish their telephone numbers?\n  Another thing that certain people obviously failed to understand was that the issue this documentary  deals with is tragifunny on its own and all Moore needs to do is add simply his personal touch to make it even more of a laugher which in turn makes it even more tragic! Which, subsequently, indicates the tremendous political irrationality involved.\n  The facts and numbers and fugures you will be confronted in ""Bowling for.."" are overwhelming and do not involve only gun deaths but other issues as well which for most belong to the area of the unknown (and there is a reason for that of course).\n  I don't think i have ever seen a film or documentary before where for days i was discussing its highlights with other people that saw it.

Amazing.\nThis is on the surface a story about the Columbine shooting and gun control. But underneath it's a statement about the use of fear as a business tool that insanely inflates the number of killings by guns in this country. Moore keeps asking why do most major countries have under 200 or under 100 deaths a year caused by guns, while the US has... better I don't give the actual number. Find out when you watch the movie. But it is a LOT, LOT more.\nI went to see the movie because I read Michael Moore's best selling book Stupid White Men and loved it. Part of my motivation was political. We've been watching the spines of half the democratic members of congress melt away, and Michael's voice has been among the strongest, making the most sense in looking at the thieves and morons in the White House.\nI'm 51 and a veteran of the good old days of anti Viet Nam War demonstrations, so I wasn't sure how my 22 year old daughter would like it. But she and her fiancee' both really enjoyed it as a smart, entertaining movie. There are times you break out laughing and times you feel sadness-- over senseless violence and stupidity.\nAnother reason I went to see this was because I want it to be a commercial success so corporations, that don't care about politics but do care about profits, will invest in more STORIES that depict the world from a more progressive, liberal perspective. We need people who put stories out there that contradict the big lies that the Bush team spews.\nOne of the reasons I organized my storycon meeting on the art, science and application of story was to explore the power of stories to make the world a better place. Michael Moore is out there at the edges of the story universe, courageously exploring new ways to create, present and use stories to make a difference. The mini story about K-mart, that was a part of this film is a wonderful example of the power of story to make a real difference.\nWatch it.

199;102.0;1.0;17.0;"Well, where to start tearing into this load of garbage is the tough part. As many of my fellow reviewers pointed out, this film has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY. Mike plays with facts, mocks innocent working class people and basically produces a warped view of the history of American gun laws and the nature of random violence. Mike's not-so-subtle manipulation of images should be obvious to even the most casual film fan.\nMoore never interviews criminologists, psychologists, or social workers on the topic of violence. Instead Moore turns to the air-headed Marilyn Manson for insight on the horror at Columbine. To interview experts would only get in the way of Mike's thesis which is : That anyone in America who disagrees with Michael Moore and his fans on gun control is a dumb, racist, violent hillbilly!  Moore focuses on the weirdest and most confused segment of pro-gun working class America and gleefuly exploits thier less than sophisticated language skills.  This approach comforts Moore's mostly educated and urban audience who will never even venture away from the cafe long enought to ever meet any of these ""primitive gun-lovin' hillbillys"". Gee, and I thought Moore was a workin' man's best friend.\nMoore also not-so-cleverly attempts to convince his upscale fans that Canada is a wonderful fantasy land where violence is rare and people never lock thier doors. Canadians are portrayed as dull simpletons who don't have an aggressive bone in thier bodies. PLEASE! Just last month there was a major killfest in Toronto where 4 people were killed in separate shootings. These people were all killed with, yep, you guessed it, UNREGISTERED GUNS. Mr. Moore, I live in east end Toronto and I triple lock my doors.\nOne part that almost made me leave the theatre was the moronic cartoon about the "" history "" of violence in the U.S.. Talk about the oversimplification of complex social and political concepts! The Klan and NRA couldn't be farther apart politicaly! To blame ALL gun related violence ( even Black on Black violence) on some half-baked  racial theory is simply insane. Moore suggests that  violence, by some unexplained psychological process, is caused by white peoples envy and fear of African Americans. This cartoon segment did the most damage to Michael's already confused and juvenile argument.\nWhat is even more shocking is that fans of this film don't for one second question the facts or Moore's motives. The cult of Moore is as fanatic and narrow minded as the militants and gun lovers that they hate so much. Moore works on and exploits the pliable minds of his  hysterical and paranoid audience and takes them on a journey through his psychotic and self-centred world view. Instead of producing a subtle and convincing documentary, Moore uses the language and entertaining style of the mass media that he claims to hate so much. This film is just a MTV, CNN, NBC or CBS style paranoia-fest that offers simple social commentary mixed with sensational footage. Moore shamelesly uses footage from the Columbine massacre in order to scare his audience into compliance with his twisted thesis.\nI'm not a huge fan of assault rifles, nor do I support super right-wing corporate maniacs.

That's the problem with so much of what liberals stand for today - they take such extreme positions in such a loud-mouthed way, they alienate most regular people. The war in Iraq is one huge example. Ordinary, patriotic Americans got so sick and tired of seeing the Martin Sheens and Susan Sarandons parading around and declaring their hatred for the Bush Administration, and the Dixie Chicks and Bruce Springsteens abusing their platform at music concerts to denounce President Bush when all that people wanted was for them to shut up and sing.\nMichael Moore is another liberal idiot who has alienated much of mainstream America. Even many of his fellow liberal celebs were embarrassed at his little tirade at the Oscars, wanting him to shut up and hurry off the stage. Moore has a knack for distorting the truth, demeaning people and taking advantage of tragedy for his own despicable political agenda. Columbine is one example. There were parents of Columbine shooting victims who didn't want to speak to Moore, knowing his twisted motives. As the father of Rachel Scott said, ""Guns didn't kill my daughter, people killed my daughter."" With their motives, those two sick boys could have used any means to murder, maim and terrify.\nA documentary would have been better spent analyzing the motives of children who want to kill their classmates. The easy access the Columbine killers had to firearms is scary for sure, and their parents should be held accountable. But to suggest guns are inherently evil and that ""gun control"" is the solution to America's bloodlust is missing the point. People were killing each other before guns were invented. There already are laws to control gun ownership. If the courts would do their job and honor the work the police do, we would be locking up many more illegal arms dealers, gangsters and drug dealers, thus making the average citizen feel safer and less inclined to buy a firearm for protection.\nFor the liberal sanctimony and falsehood presented in this ""documentary,"" I loathe Michael Moore more than ever.

311;106.0;3.0;17.0;"Bowling for Columbine is an entertaining hour and a half. But as the credits roll, you'll begin to have doubts about its value as a piece of journalism or, for that matter, even as a political polemic.\nIt certainly demonstrates the power wielded by a documentary maker. That curious feeling that comes after an argument that's gone badly - ""If only I'd said [Insert witty but devastating rejoinder here]"" - must be something Moore's interviewees feel en masse. Moore himself doesn't have that problem: with the benefit of hindsight he can (and does) supply his own explanatory commentary, and he edits and de-contextualises statements made by interviewees with whom he doesn't agree.\nSuch sleight of hand is very hard to spot (though the dead giveaways are very brief, fractured interview excerpts) and impossible to unpick from the viewer's perspective.\nWhat can be unpicked, however, is Moore's logic. The order of the day is innuendo, double standards and bias.\nMoore (quite correctly, in my view) pooh-poohs Marilyn Manson's responsibility for influencing the Columbine gunners, pointing out the lack of causative evidence for the link and arguing that the killers were just as likely to have been influenced by the trip they made to a bowling alley on the day of the shootings (hence the title of the film). But without drawing a breath, Moore suggests that instead we should look to US foreign policy for the reason - Columbine occurred on the day of the US's most heavy bombardment of Kosovo. You can't have it both ways, and imagining these particular adolescents having any idea about US foreign policy is laughable.\nSimilarly, we are told Columbine is nearby the factory, in Littleton Colorado, of Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer. Well, *a* factory, at any rate. What we're not told is that the factory manufactures no weapons, only weather and communications satellites. A hapless company spokesman is interviewed in front of an enormous rocket-like thing, which (though Moore doesn't mention it) is exactly that: a rocket, for launching satellites. Moore describes it as a ""Missile of Mass Destruction"". In any case, the likelihood that the location or existence of this factory, weapon producing or not, triggered the Columbine shootings is surely low.\nMoore makes many statements which have no probative value and can only have been included for the prejudice they would dredge up in the viewer: we are informed, for example, that the National Rifle Association was founded in the same year the Ku Klux Klan was criminalised. Exactly what point Moore thought he was making here is not clear. Winston Churchill was born and there was a fire in Chicago in the same year, but Moore doesn't mention these. Both are about as relevant.\nMoore is inconsistent in his attribution of blame for the crisis and eventually just gives up. Given the amount of time he spends pursuing Charlton Heston, you would think that the NRA is his main target. Indeed, it seems to be, though by the conclusion of the film Moore has almost conceded that the NRA mantra - it's people, not guns, who kill - is pretty much right. He makes much of gun crime statistics in which the handgun murder rate in the US is measured in tens of thousands, against mere hundreds in European countries, and Canada. It's very difficult to verify the statistics, which are widely cited, but he points out that Canada has almost as common gun ownership as the United States, but only 130 murders a year. Which would suggest that gun ownership (and therefore the NRA) really isn't the problem.\nWhen pushed on this point, the NRA trots out what Moore clearly considers the old chestnut that America has a history of violence. Moore makes the counterpoint (repeatedly during the film) that Germany, Russia and France all have violent histories, but nothing like the US's gun fatalities. The fact of the matter is that Europe's history of violence has generally been a case of state perpetrating it on the population and not the population on each other, and at any rate it has generally been profoundly political in nature. The American history of violence (until very recently) has been neither.\nMoore also spends some time on the case in Flint, Michigan where a six year old took a gun to school and shot a classmate. This he blames on right wing politics; the child's mother having been forced to work for welfare and so not on hand to see her child packing its gun for school. Moore corners Dick Clark, at whose bar and grill she was working at the time of the tragedy, to no obvious point. Wisely, Clark shuts the door of his van and bids his driver depart at once. The shooting looks for all the world like a tragic accident, and had little if anything to do with trickledown economics, and certainly wasn't Dick Clark's fault.\nAt the end of the day, this is a very entertaining but highly disingenuous film. I don't think you could call it a piece of journalism, nor really a documentary, as it is so frequently wide of the mark as to enter the fictional realm - sometimes lazily, but I suspect sometimes maliciously.\nAs long as you watch it with a healthy sense of scepticism it isn't a bad night in.";entertaining but disingenuous

388;108.0;4.0;17.0;"Full disclosure: I can't stand Michael Moore's politics; I am about as far removed from the Great Yawping Gadfly of the American Left as it is possible for a man to be.\nThat said, I enjoyed, got a few laughs, and was (in spots) actually moved by Bowling for Columbine, which aims higher than Moore's previous blockbuster documentary ""Roger and Me"", but ultimately, due to muddled ideas and sloppy execution, falls short. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though: ""Bowling"" is both more ambitious and ultimately more entertaining that ""Roger and Me.""\nLet's get the basics out of the way: ""Bowling for Columbine"" is ostensibly Moore's quest to find out what motivated Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the self-described 'Trenchcoat Mafia' who murdered 13 of their fellow classmates (and a teacher) in Littleton, Colorado in April 1999. The title of the film refers to the pair's unusual pre-massacre activity: they went bowling.\nI say ""Bowling"" is 'ostensibly' about the Columbine massacre because the film is only obliquely, and shallowly, concerned with the horrific events in Littleton.  The facts of the killing are dealt with briefly, and we never see pictures of Harris or Klebold; indeed, the security camera film that captured the massacre in the library (grainy, ominous, and horrible, with an instrumental version of Marilyn Manson's ""Nobodies"" in the background) is frustrating in that it is impossible to see either of the killers.  Of course, Moore is making a larger point in ""Bowling"": that the Columbine massacre was not simply a unique incident, but symptomatic of some underlying American disease. ""Bowling"", then, is Moore's attempt to address and discover the disease itself. Unfortunately, along the way, Moore's diagnosis is hijacked by two of the filmmaker's favorite bugaboos: gun control and the National Rifle Association (NRA).\nMichael Moore is himself a strange and highly filmable character, a huge, rangy, lumbering man whose physical presence, particularly when paired with cowering corporate drones frantically parsing their comments, is screechingly funny. Moore has the true documentarian's gift for capturing the absurd on film, and his timing, for the most part, is impeccable. Indeed, when Moore is not preaching and simply lets the camera roll, the film is at its most hysterical. The encounter with the K-Mart PR flak is wonderful; so too is the interview with a Michigan state trooper, who waxes on a bit too much concerning an accident where a hunter is shot by the rifle he draped around his dog's neck---all to get a ""cute"" picture. A snippet of dialogue will suffice:\nTROOPER: ""The picture would have been really cute.""\nMOORE: ""But do you think the dog might have done it intentionally, had an idea of what it was doing?""\nTROOPER: ""Oh, I can't say, sir. I don't know.""\nDialogue like this is in abundant supply, and how can you hate a man who badgers Dick Clarke (who escapes in a minivan)? Even better is Moore's interview with members of the Michigan militia: again, the brilliance in this sequence is that Moore's camera (and the idiotic comments made by the militia members) tells the story, without Moore having to say a thing. Slightly more uncomfortable is Moore's interview with James Nichols, who was indicted in the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing along with his more infamous brother and Tim McVeigh. To me, this was one of the most disturbing parts of the movie; Nichols is so manic that I actually felt concerned for Moore's safety. This sequence is actually quite compelling, leading me to conclude that perhaps with certain folks (Nichols, for instance), a little gun control might not be a bad thing.\n""Bowling"" is not a bad film, but it is a muddled film. Moore wants desperately to bash the NRA, but by his own admission American gun ownership is not really the culprit behind the violence of American society. There are some issues where Moore's taste is questionable, of course: the heavily edited interview with Charleton Heston comes across as oafish, and the animated ""Brief History of the United States"" is deplorably racist.\nBut if anything, Moore hobbles his own movie by not addressing his own thesis: if gun ownership isn't the issue, then what is? What follows is Moore jumping from one causal link to another: violent video games, shock rock, Goth culture, drugs, sex, rock n' roll, and the focus-deprived American media, all linked by sequences where Moore bashes the NRA.\nThis is where the movie is most frustrating: Moore comes close, very close, to understanding Columbine, with two very keen interviews---and nonetheless misses the larger point. South Park producer/director/creator Matt Stone makes some very precise points about the nature of American high school culture, a time in wihch evolution seems in reverse, when those least fit to succeed in the larger culture terrorize those who are brightest, most ambitious, and most different.\nBy far the best interview in the piece is with Marilyn Manson, who suggests the best way of dealing with bullying and harrassment in high school is to grow up, to get through it, and to discover that life is dramatically different (and far more rewarding) after graduation. Matt Stone, Marilyn Manson, and Bill Gates, and even Michael Moore prove it: the geeks shall inherit the Earth.\nAsked by Moore what he would tell Harris and Klebold if he could, Manson provides the film's best nuggest of wisdom: ""I would say nothing at all; I would listen. And that was exactly what wasn't done.""\nA pity that Mr. Moore, for all his cinematic talents, didn't heed that advice. That said, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is well done, informative, provocative, and entertaining. And by the way, is it really that easy to get an interview with Heston?";Witty, funny, horrifying, exasperating---and nearly right.

""Poverty"" is defined as having an income below the ""threshold"" (the least amount of money that can get you by depending on where you live and how many people/children/elderly live in your household). ""Unemployment"" means you do not have a job AND are looking for a job. Unemployment, to an extent, can tell you about the state of a country's economy. However, many of the world's industrialized nations have much more generous unemployment and welfare benefits. In some cases, it might be better to remain unemployed than to settle for a low-wage job, unlike here in the U.S. where welfare and unemployment benefits have been cut to the bone. Many people in poverty here in the U.S. actually do work, but can't make enough money to make ends meet. Another point is that every other industrialized nation provides health care and many provide universal college as well. Also, the boys from Columbine were not poor, so why did they shoot all those kids and teachers?\n\nPoint of contradiction: Michael Moore describes a school shooting incident involving a toddler African-American kid who shot a toddler girl in his grade. His mother could not look after him very well because she was forced, as part of a welfare-to-work program, to take a bus miles away from her house, and work a low-wage job. Had she been able to look after her child, could this have been prevented? Most likely, but does this not contradict Moore's earlier point that poverty does not cause more crime?\n\n#2. Divorce rates: Moore counters a point made by conservatives that the divorce rate and the ""break up of the family"" in this country is causing us to commit crimes. He looks at England, and says that they have a higher divorce rate. But then again, if Moore is so convinced that ""unemployment"" means ""poverty,"" England does have a lower unemployment (at least they did when this documentary was made).\n\nPoint of contradiction: if that toddler boy (mentioned above) had a father around, wouldn't the shooting have been prevented?\n\n#3. Violence in the media: Michael Moore points that every other country watches our movies and many violent video games come from Japan, but they don't experience these problems. However, this is where we get to what appears to be Michael Moore's silly theory as to what causes violence in the U.S.: ""the media pumping us full of fear"". In other words, because our media reports on violent crimes (and other scary things that could happen to us), we commit violent crimes. Is the media supposed to stay silent every time a murder occurs.\n\nPoint of contradiction: Michael ridicules those who say violence in the media causes violence in reality, but he contradicts himself when he claims that ""pumping us with fear"" causes us to commit crimes. Again, it's all about violence in the media.\n\n#4. America's violent history: Michael Moore attempts to counter those who say our violent history is a reason for us being violent. Moore points out the violent histories of Britain and France in their colonies, as well as Nazi Germany, but then says that all these countries have low violence rates. However, Michael Moore GREATLY contradicts himself soon afterwards with his ""History of America"" cartoon, which portrays the history of America as a bunch of scared white people shooting everybody. Also, during his ""What a Wonderful World"" sequence, Michael Moore lists many of the violent ""acts"" committed by the U.S., whether through funding, weapons supplying, or direct invasion, in attempt to show that the U.S. does not make weapons only for ""defensive"" purposes. I will make a few points on this:\n\na. During the 'What a wonderful World"" sequence, some of Michael Moore's points have incomplete information and are somewhat erroneous. For example, the ""4 million kill(ed) in Southeast Asia"" has to do with the Vietnam War. Also, Michael Moore fails to note the percentages of the casualties from all of the U.S. interventions were rebels, soldiers, or civilians.\n\nb. The United States did not give money to or train ""terrorist groups"" or ""Osama bin Laden"" to ""kill Soviets"". The Soviets, first of all, invaded Afghanistan in 1979. We decided to help fund, supply, and train the Mujahadeen (a.k.a. the Afghan Rebels) to fend them off. After all, we were in a Cold War with the Soviets. Osama bin Laden could very well have been one of the freedom fighters, but he was not on our radar as a ""terrorist"" back then. Second, were we to just sit there and watch Afghanistan fall to the Soviets? Watch them as they massacre Muslim children?\n\nc. MIchael Moore says that in 1991, we ""Entered Iraq, reinstated dictator of Kuwait"". This was the Gulf War, where the entire world was on our side here in a clear-cut case of aggression when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. We did bomb a little bit of Iraq in order to get Saddam to stop but this was a war started by Saddam.\n\nd. Michael Moore vastly contradicts himself by listing these ""violent acts of the United States"", and then go on to say that a country's violent history does not make it's citizens more prone to violence. Also, Michael Moore seems to correlate that on the day of Columbine was the biggest one-day bombing campaign in Kosovo, and he lets Marylin Manson say, ""Well, the president is dropping bombs...don't you think that causes violence?""\n\nSo what does cause violence in America? Perhaps we will never know, and Michael Moore clearly didn't. Since Amazon requires one star, I at least will give it one of my own because this documentary is funny at times and makes interesting points. But as for Michael Moore's overall points, he does not make them at all. A very weak documentary from him, indeed.";Almost no sense whatsoever
409;124.0;5.0;16.0;"What makes this film so remarkable is the truth that it ultimately tells. Simplisticly he traces the rampant gun mania in this country back to the origins of this country being on genocide and slavery. I'd seen Moore talk about his film on Oprah at length before I saw this film, as well as the three minute cartoon that traces the US history and shows the paranoia that white people have been engendered with.\nA film that focuses on gun control becomes about race and racism. The racial portrayal of people of color in the media, the media eagerly showing particular races ad nauseum commiting crimes, over and over and over, forcing white people to believe their engendered fears about other races. The audience laughed at all the appropriate parts until it became about race, then only the people of color laughed because of the bitter truth of the entire situation. White people are afraid to admit this truth, this fear, this internalized terror that seems to stalk so many to the point of getting as many guns as possible.\nCharlton Heston, spokesman for the NRA, is interviewed in the film and even he admits that part of the problem, the crime is because of so many ethnicities in this country.\nWhite people are so afraid. Afraid because America is a Me culture, unlike other countries that have socialized medicine, socialized care for the elderly, and at some level while it affords immediate gratification, we all understand that isn't right.\nI don't know how to make White people less scared, to get a population of 280 million to relinquish having 250 million guns or 750 million televisions which honestly is becoming a manifestation of what we all project as ""the Devil"". We're slowly imploding into consumerism, a mentality of attack, attack, attack with a focus on war and destruction and killing each other. Frankly, after leaving the movie, I was ashamed that I lived in a country where our children can turn not only physically, whether purposefully as in Columbine or in Flint, accidentally, to killing. Children are killing. What else do we need as a wake up call?\nI took a class man years ago taught by an Indian chief and his lesson was that every culture has armageddon mythology but that American Indian mythology includes that the winds will be out of control, that our weather patterns will no longer make sense and the next that our children will kill. I do believe that the focus of television and video games and movies teaches children HOW to kill and destroy but it is America's lack of emapthy and compassion that teaches them WHY to kill.\nWhen so many people Moore interviewed were asked why they were arming themselves, they came back to the 2nd Amendment, to the necessity to protect themselves, their families, to the fear of the THEM coming for them whether it be government or SOMEONE, colored ultimately and I thought to myself what people of color are taught from a young age: White people are crazy, and now there's a film to support that theory.\nStatistically it bears out that Black peopel have actually committed less crime in teh past 10 years than White people, 30% lowering while there has been a 600% increase in teh showing of black men as criminals on TV. Amazingly companies like Enron and World Com that financially rape millions of people of their entire lives are shown briefly before we get back to the projected terrorists and racial dangers here in America. White citizens born into fear and constantly propogandized by television about fearing are arming themselves and ironically as we learned in Columbine, killing themselves. White children go hog wild with guns, white men are more apt to commit suicide and take the family with them, white peopel wage war without the UN support and teh rest of us sit and watch.\nI've been to Canada and honestly the White people there are different, maybe it's more space, maybe it's because they are a country committed to caring about people, not just thru lip service but through social and financial commitment---free medical care for EVERYONE, care for the elderly, a higher unemployment rate but a giv't committed to employing it's citizens. A mass of 30 million people who have 7 million guys and less than 200 gun shootings a year. America, 280 million has close to 12,000 gun murders a year. Even by the simplistic math of avering 10 times more in population we should only have 2000 average gun related shootings a year and yet we have 6 times THAT amount.\nAmerica is hemorraging from lack of social care for EVERYONE, rich or poor, lack of parental classes, lack of marital classes, lack of integrity, lack of responsible election processes, lack of big business regulation and lack of respect for the world. Its funny how this film correlates the ideology into the political system, but like a disease this is rampant to the very concept of the 3 card monte deal of hunting for Osama to blaming Saddam Hussein for the world's teroristic problems. Bush knows how many weapons of mass destruction are in Iraq, why?> because his daddy sold them to Iraq when Hussein was helped to established power by the US to oppose Iran. We didn't care about the actions of teh regime then, it was only when oil prices went up that we became concerned about the second largest producer of oil on the planet.\nCuriously enough I got an email about my initial review of thsi film that told me to ""go back home"" if I didn't like it here. In truth, I am Naragansett Indian, an undistrubed line from my great-grandfather, anyone not of American Indian descent is on MY land my the legal possession rights of America. I am home. But hasn't that always been the racist yell from the battle for Integration, to vote, to exist? That if anyone here in America disagrees, as supposedly allowed in a democracy, they should :go back to where THEY came from"". Again that ""THEM"". I expect that not every person of any color shares the masses attitudes, except perhaps in this country that through first genocide of millions of Indians and then slavery of several races to build up the financial base became the mess we have today.";Thinking is America's least favorite past time

About 50% of murders in America are committed by blacks even though they make only about 12% of the total population.  Murder rate among blacks is 7-8 times higher than among whites.  Michael Moore did not include this troublesome information in his movie and in my opinion such an omission disqualifies it as a documentary.";Forced to give 1 star.
90;127.0;5.0;15.0;I just saw the movie, I had intended to see it as soon as it came out and it somehow got postponed over and over. Finally, I had the pleasure of indulging in the Michael Moore experience. I came here to look for reviews because I was very interested in what Americans had to say about it (because people from any other country in the world, me included, thought it brilliant). Predictably enough, Americans attack Moore and claim he's innacurate, that he contradicts himself, that he's bluffing. Sorry to tell you dear ones, the History of the US presented in the movie IS the real thing. Those details you claim he leaves behind are those that your goverment manipulated you into believing. I don't know if Moore makes a point, but I do know that you have to be extremely naive to actually buy George's story of the nuclear weapons in Irak. It is so evidently OBVIOUS! How can you not see it? Michael Moore is just trying to open people's eyes, is all.;The sad truth

It was a long movie with horrible interviews and at one point has Michael  carrying on a crusade against K-Mart. K-MART???

He is part of the problem he presents. He has shamelessly edited parts of the interviews to present his points of view.

While Moore's methods of research and questioning are somewhat suspect, his heart seems to be in the right place.  And this is what allows this movie to become truly amazing.  It has emotion that most other documentaries lack, and because Moore is unafraid to offend people, it makes this truly spectacular.  The idiocy that Heston exhibits in this movie makes it worth the purchase price alone.\nAgree or disagree with what Moore has to say, you will still find this documentary entertaining and ultimately touching.;Truly Amazing

Clearly things are one sided and edited in such a way to protray his views.  This is not a documentary but rather is progapanda just as KKK films or NeoNazi films are.  All sway their views with facts, but facts from only one side.  I really wonder about the education and objectivity of society today, a society that blesses this film.  Wow.

370;134.0;5.0;15.0;My highest recommendations. Despite a very transparent campaign to discredit the integrity of the movie, this film still holds up as a very honest and sincere exploration of first the problem of rising gun deaths and then the culture of fear in america. The film's engaging, certainly entertaining and informative. But hopefully people don't stop at the movie. In my case the movie gave me a lot of food for thought, was the cause of much pondering and debate and it really affected me. As far as the accusations of the movie, this just shows how groundbreaking and challenging this movie is. If not for the accusations of the director being biased, falsifying information and staging certain scenes in the movie I probably would have never researched things for myself and found out how strong this movie is. As for being biased, this movie isn't any more biased than the network news channels, white house, politicians from all parties, other documenatarians out there. If anything this director's biased towards integrity, self accountabality and speaking for the little guy/gal (the average american). Still, whether you think this movie's a brilliant expose on the nature of guns and fear in america or a sorry train wreck, you still won't be able to keep your eyes off it once you get in the theaters. Any movie that causes this much of a reaction in people can't be all bad. ....;The movie to watch
372;135.0;3.0;15.0;Michael Moore raises important questions about violence in America, and offers some provocative answers.  Unfortunately, he is so clearly biased by his own political views, that his conclusions lack credibility, and ultimately the film degenerates into a political manifesto.  The clearest indication of this is that those who share Moore's political views love the film, while those who don't hate it.\nAt first, the film seems to be an intelligent investigation into the question of why gun violence is so widespread in the U.S.  Using the tragedy of Columbine as a focal point, Moore explores the factors that might explain why, for example, the number of gun deaths is over 11,000 per year in the U.S., while being less than 100 in most other industrial nations.  This is a striking statistic, and the viewer will be eager to learn more.\nBut this is no Frontline investigation.  The statistics and historical accounts are distorted, the interviews are staged to make some people look good and others look bad, and anecdotes are presented as generalized facts.  In short, it soon becomes apparent that the filmmaker is far from objective and probably had his mind made up about the topic before starting the film.\nThere is nothing wrong with making a film with a point of view.  But then don't try to pass it off as a documentary.  It's the blurring of the line between objective reporting and proselytizing that makes this film so insidious.\nMoore has a way of interviewing those he doesn't like or agree with that is obviously staged to make them look bad, and he uses this technique shamelessly.  He peppers Charlton Heston and Dick Clark with questions that are really rude accusations, and then makes a big deal of the fact that they terminate the interview, as if somehow this is evidence of their guilt, rather than his rudeness.  He gets away with it because it is entertaining to watch.  At the same time,  Moore practically coddles Marilyn Manson and others that support his point of view and can be seen effusively agreeing with them on camera.\nBottom line: this is a film about an important topic that will make you think, and is worth seeing, as long as you keep in mind that it is not a documentary, but rather an opinion piece staged as a documentary.;Provocative Film by an Overzealous Filmmaker
377;136.0;1.0;15.0;I agree with some of the other reviewers.\nI've heard many accusations against this film, and I don't want to hear them anymore. I don't want to hear about...\n-- How the missiles referred to in the film were for `commercial' use not military.  It's the same thing.  A missile is a missile and all missiles are bad missiles, and Moore would agree with me.\n-- How the Heston speech was spliced together from two different speeches, making him look like he's saying something different.  Hey, he said those words.  Context doesn't matter, and Moore would agree with me.\n-- How the bank sequence is staged.  That doesn't matter.  It's not like this is a documentary, and Moore would agree with me.\n-- How the statistics about China's gun record are stellar because China is communist.  Of course, that's why they call it a `police state'.  And Moore would agree with me.\n-- Canada isn't really that good of a place to live.  Yeah, but hockey is still a really cool sport.... Even if Moore doesn't agree.\n-- France is socialist.  Duh, just like Moore is.\nI've heard it all before. I don't care. This was an entertaining movie. I don't go to the movies to learn 'facts' I go to be entertained, and that's what this movie does. Don't confuse me with 'truth' vs. 'error'. Life's too short for all that.\nThank you Mr. Moore for giving us a highly entertaining. It's better than the Matrix!;Super Fun!
392;137.0;5.0;15.0;"First off, I have actually seen this film. I enjoyed it but feel it lack the cohesive argue of his brilliant first film ""Roger and Me"" and the work he did on TV Nation.\nBut let's be honest. These reviews that sharply divide between excellent and poor are not about the film's content.  After the Oscars, Michael Moore has become demonized along with French wine as the symbol for ideas that threaten the union. Behind all that double speak, it's about the polarization of free speech attitudes.\nAfter the 911 tragedy, the public unaware that its' security was an illusion all along hungered for voice in the woods.  Black and White. Good and Evil.  They wanted a clear worldview with out messy entanglements that would save them from the chaos. But there is a price all this Homeland security and it seems to require giving up freedoms like speach and rights to privacy. Not to mentioning allowing a right wing agenda to sweep through when normally it would be met with opposition.\nThe one thing you can't have is people questioning authority. Oh, they will say it's because we are not supporting our troops and endangering them. But if we are engaged in another war at the time of elections will debate of ideas be suspended. I think not. The real reason is for them to be secured everyone has to go along with the flow. They just can't risk an alternate view that might put them in perceived jeopardy. And yet the reasons for war remain unclear and world is still hopped up on worry.\nI applaud the Mr. Moore for standing up and not allowing themselves to be bullied by those who want to use public opinion to stifle a dissenting view. In that light, I will add my 5 star review to out weigh those with an axe to grind.\nIt would seem their little plan has backfired though. The Dixie Chick concerts still sell out. Michael Moore's book is on the bestseller list and he has been approached about starting up TV Nation again.\nAs for me, I eagerly await the Bowling for Columbine DVD release that I might enjoy it in the privacy of my home drinking a nice French wine.

420;140.0;1.0;15.0;Ultra liberal?  Hmmm, well definately not conservative.  Michael Moore is making another attempt to point the finger and show you who is to blame.  In Roger and Me, he pointed the finger at corporate america as the plight of the american work force.  In Bowling for Columbine it's the ancient views of the conservatives and the right to bare arms, of which I am in favor in.  Again, at the Academy awards the finger was pointed at our President, calling him a ficticious president.  It's much easier to point the finger than to take the resposibility for oneself, especially when pointing the finger proves itself as a good way to make a living.\nIf guns in society are truly the problem then how do you explain the increasing rate of children under 12 committing sexual molestation, rape and murder, without the use of guns?  What will you point your finger at next Mr. Moore?  At what point will we admit that it just may be the lack of moral and religious values that we instill in our children?  Society has become so cautious not to intrude on the values and beliefs of the few, but what will become of the freedom of the masses?  The value of religion in our schools is that it makes individuals resposible for themselves and their sins, even when there are no visible witnesses.\nMichael Moore will probably continue to entertain and maintain an audience, just as Jerry Springer has his own group of viewers.  And in good form, I wish him the best of luck.;Too much freedom!

There is so much here that it would take days, and countless discussions to simply scratch that surface of what the underlying themes are. There are no two ways about it, Moore is preaching to us, but since it is done so well, it is okay.\nAfter reading other opinions about how Moore is using this movie to capitalize on the deaths of countless americans, and the school shootings, and so on... I am compelled to say that people that write reviews like those are obviously missing the point, and (excuse my candid nature) are too daft to watch these types of movies in the first place. They should stick to their boy bands, and their 'Star Wars' movies. Not that 'Star Wars' is a bad movie, it is just not a thinking movie.\nJust to reiterate, whether you are pro-gun, anti-gun, or undecided, this film should start you thinking by giving you more knowledge to work with.

He asks average people why they think Americans kills so much more than others, and they are often unintentionally funny and sometimes very sad.

From the beginning of this interview, Moore is (pathetically) trying to bait Charleton Heston in some way. As Heston walks away, Moore delivers a disingenuous appeal to moral sensitivity--as if he was simply (and innocently) thinking an apology from Heston might make the world a better place. Give us a break. In truth, Moore is using a technique from his fairly limited repertoire--namely, the attempt to vilify people he doesn't like. Here Moore was face-to-face with the NRA-head-honcho himself, and do we get a serious dialogue about gun control? No, only Moore's cheap theatrics.\nIn logic, there is a fallacy called the ""Ad Hominem fallacy""; it occurs when you attack the person presenting the argument instead of the argument itself. I think something similar is being done by Moore in this film. For all I know, Dick Clark and Charleton Heston MAY be old, compassionless, rich, white men (as Moore seems to insinuate), but what bearing does that have on the issues of welfare and gun control? (However, I must add: Walking away from a filmmaker who is anxious to make you look bad in no way demonstrates that you are insensitive to the issues he's addressing. It may just mean that you've got sense.)\nI began this film with an open mind (remembering only that Moore was a funny guy I'd seen on TV several years ago) but was very perturbed by the end of it. I'm interested in sorting out my own views about gun control in America, but I found this film to be extremely unhelpful in that enterprise. I worry that many Americans will consider Moore's film to be some sort of argument for Moore's views. In my opinion, the film offers only the weakest support for the various theses he seems to be espousing, and Bowling for Columbine seems much closer to propaganda than respectable documentary.";Complaints about Moore's methods

If this ""documentary"" is Michael Moore's view of the world, then he needs therapy.\nHe seems to only see the most negative aspects of people, and tries to prove his points with a form of analysis that completely evades me.\nExplain again how K-Mart was responsible for a couple of kids going on a murder spree?  I guess that my family should go after Coors and Shell Oil if I get killed by a drunk driver.  The drunk driver should not be held responsible for his actions, because Shell put gas in his car and Coors put alcohol in his blood...damn those evil corporations.\nHe completely lost me with the references to Marilyn Manson, bowling, rocket motors and the NRA.

Better to ask yourself WHY children in America are committing these heinous acts than do a knee-jerk 'blame the NRA' thing.\nHow about the sea of pornography, much of which exploits children, running through our land? How about the greed for money and power exhibited by women in our country, resulting in kids coming home to empty BIG houses and eating dinner by themselves? How about the lack of respect for human life we teach our children when we say a woman has a right to choose a late term abortion, even if that means we karate-chop a 4 lb baby's head before it's even out of her womb? How about the way we teach our children that God can't be trusted by teaching them it's wrong to say His name in school?\nRemember this: Hitler, Saddam, and Stalin were all avid gun-control proponents.

154;149.0;2.0;14.0;I don't belong to the NRA nor do I support their mission.  That being said, I found Bowling for Columbine to be without merit for the following reasons.\nFirst, Moore's many interviews add little to our understanding of the tragedy at Columbine High School.  In fact, the film reminded me more of David Letterman making fun of his guests than Charlie Rose trying to understand the meaning of a serious problem by talking with intelligent people with information to share.  Additionally, without the variety of point of view needed to give balance to the discussion, the film dragged on and on.\nNext, Moore's editing of his material was similar to the tiny bits and pieces of information shown on the evening news to hold the attention of a public needing constant stimulation and entertainment. Moore needs to take a lesson from Jim Lehrer who stays focused on his subject in order to arrive at reasonable closure.  Also, Moore juxtaposes images to manipulate his audience and suggest valid comparison where none exists.\nLastly, Moore takes a shotgun approach to his documentary.  He fires his blasts here and there hoping to get a hit and occasionaly he does, but the hits are few and far between.  At the end of the film Moore interviews Charlton Heston, looking much the worse for wear and tear, and tries to get Heston to tell us why Columbine happened.  Heston hasn't a clue and neither does Moore.  I thought I might get some insight about the tragedy at Columbine, but all I got was tragedy turned into a bad Hollywood film.\nBowling for Columbine fails as a documentary and fails as a Hollywood entertainment.;The strikes are few and far between in Bowling for Columbine

Would you like Michael Moore to make a documentary that twisted the truth and lied about something you love?\nDon't focus your evidence to state your case on fringe groups and radicals just to envoke emotion, by using that logic you would be able to state that anyone who rides a motorcycle is a drugged out member of a radical motorcycle gang and therefore all motorcycles should be banned to stop the spread of violence and crime that these gangs have been attributed with doing.  Should we ban cars because some people drink and drive and kill people?\nJust because you enjoy having the right to own the gun you want does not make you a crazy criminal.  I have shot hundreds of thousands of rounds over the years and I have never ever gone on a killing rampage nor have I ever had the desire to do so.  The NRA is not some evil empire.  It is a political action group that was formed to protect our rights from people who, because they think they know best, would like to limit what I can and can not purchase and own.

I'm willing to bet that if we were all eating in a resturant and some crazy criminal came through the door with illegally obtained firearms blazing away, you would come over and shake my hand and thank me after I put a bullet between the guys eyes.  Criminals are going to get guns if they want them.  The only thing that so called ""gun-control"" does is take them out of the hands of honest citizens.  Use your mind a little bit people.\n(...)  I lived in a country that denied its citizens the right to own and carry firearms for three years while in the Navy.  Guess what?

Heston is obviously not at his best and in the early stages of Alzheimers. His lack of recall is show as a way to depict him and all 2nd ammendment supporters as uncaring and callous. It would have been much fairer to everyone if he had been able to give that same interview 5 or 10 years earlier.

He doesn't give respect to the populations of the counties in question, he counts `gun deaths' differently from case to case and he lies about the chronology of numerous events. Moore simply patched together a series of dubious stats and out of context file footage. His goal was to frustrate the political right with lies and to fuel the fire of ignorance on the political left. He succeeded.\nAnd when his integrity is questioned, Moore immediately counters with a flagrant ad hominem attack. He says that everyone who discredits his movie is a `right wing zealot' with malicious motivations. He will not even entertain questions about the truthfulness of his so called documentary. His only defense is the fallacious statement, 'All of the facts in my film are true.' No crap! How stupid does he think we are?

398;156.0;5.0;14.0;I am not one to easily place a five star vote on a film, but this one deserves it.\nThe film is filled with positive messages and looks on life. Many will complain about its inaccuracy and loose definitions of a 'time line'. This is of no importance. For instance, the statement 'life is beautiful', can be argued to death as being 'accurate' or 'inaccurate', but it does not change the fact that the message is positive for society as a whole. The same way this film's many messages on gun control are also positive for America and the world as a whole.\nAmerica's lack of gun control is appalling. Abroad, I do not have one friend that owns a gun, while in a America, I would be lucky to find one that didn't own any. This by definition creates many, unnecessary, 'accidents' waiting to happen. This film is a humorous and entertaining account of 'a step in the right direction' for increasing gun control, and I am very pleased that it is watched by so many and unappreciated by so few.\nIt is definitely a film to own.

But then he tells you only poverty kills people.  But then he tells you guns are not bad at all.  But then he tells you President Bush kills people.  This was no doubt a very racist film, Moore completely stereotypes all races.

433;158.0;5.0;14.0;"Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, winner of this year's Academy Award for best documentary film, is the greatest documentary ever made.  Like his other stellar film, Roger & Me, Moore has the uncanny ability to combine tragedy and humor in what is a film for the ages.  Because of the recent situation in Iraq, this film will stimulate discussion as it connects so many relevant issues together, particularly violence and cultural values.\nVisually, the film is stunning.  The editing is fabulous, and I can think of no other documentarian, save Errol Morris, who can so skillfully combine the varied interviews, film clips, cartoons and dialogues in a coherent manner.  Unlike some documentaries that lay out a linear narrative, Moore's look at violence in the United States leaves the viewer questioning the ultimate outcome of the weaving that the director undertakes through the various threads of the film.  The skillful editing allows this open-endedness of Bowling for Columbine to emerge.  If you watch this film with friends, you will enjoy how it will stimulate so much varied discussion of the topic.\nI viewed Bowling for Columbine as part of a film series at our local college and I did not meet one person who saw the film who was not moved by it.  I believe that anyone who views this film will think differently about violence and the unfortunate role that it plays in all of our lives.\nLike Moore's other films, BFC utilizes effective interviews that represent people from all walks of life.  Though the film's title suggests it is a documentary about the Columbine tragedy, Columbine is itself but one case study in a complex picture of violence-from violence on television (COPS), to school violence, to excessive reporting of fear on the news (killer bees), to the proliferation of guns, to the work of defense manufactures and the role of the U.S. government in overthrowing other governments and killing its citizens.  Bowling for Columbine teaches us the important message that violence is a part of our every existence and that the culture of the United States may be unique in the fact that its citizens are victims of gun violence more than any other country.  ""Why do we kill so many people with our guns?,"" this the question Moore sets out to answer in his documentary, but ultimately leaves to his viewers to answer.  This is an incredibly intelligent film!\nNo doubt Bowling for Columbine will interest educators.  I plan to incorporate it in a number of my classes.  This would also be a great film to show at your local community center film series-it WILL get people talking.  Particularly in times of war, this film may get people to think twice about supporting state-level violence.  Hopefully, viewers of this film will come away with a more critical understanding of culture in the United States, and work to change that culture both in political senses and in striving to eliminate violence in their own lives.  Viewers may also come to better appreciate the documentary film form.  As Michael Moore alluded to in his Academy Award acceptance speech, more people should be watching documentaries.  They teach us important things about our lives that feature films cannot.\nIf there is one film that you purchase this year make it Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine.

455;160.0;2.0;14.0;Its ironic the number of reviewers who see this as an anti-gun statement. With as much respect as I can muster they have missed the point, as indeed has Mr Moore.\nMr Moore was making an intelligent and insightful essay into the roots of ALL violence in America, but I suspect he got a bit lost when events caught up with him.\nThe irony is, gentle reader, that Mr Moore supplies plenty of ammunition for pro-gun people. For example, he shows clearly that Canadian gun ownership is very high, yet has nowhere the level of gun crime as the United States. Pro- rata New Zealand has as high a gun ownership rate as the US, but has less than 100 gun fatalities a year- and that includes suicides and accidents. So if guns cause crime, surely Canada would have as high a rate as the USA? One fellow interviewed points out that gun ownership as increased, yet the rate of crime has gone down. Again, if the guns were the problem wouldnt you see the increase? One women points out that when your house is attacked why do you call the police? Well, she says it is because they are the ones with the guns.\nThe point is, the film was heading towards making the point that violence is not a single faceted problem, and many factors contribute- maybe music, maybe violent video games, who knows? However, about two thirds through the film, he started to investigate the tragic shooting of a young girl at a school by a six year old boy. Without a doubt, this was a tragic accident, but is it not- and again Mr Moore misses the point- anything more than an accident. Indeed the NRA's own gun safety programmes deal with exactly that situation and isn't it a shame that the boy concerned hadn't seen it.\nPrevious reviewers have focused on the guns, and not looked at the other points the film have made, such as the dig at US foreign policy. Indeed Mr Moore makes that point, showing that on the day of the columbine shooting there were heavy US airstrikes. Dealing with that suddenley seemed too hard, and he pulled the film back to a superficail argument- ban the guns and suddenley everything is hunky dorey.\nBe warned that much of this film is not for the squimish. You will see numerous shootings, and some terrible footage from columbine itself. It is not to be taken lightly.\nAll in all an interesting view of the USA. It is such a shame that Mr Moore didn't control his emotions, and present a more balanced view.;The point missed

474;162.0;5.0;14.0;"I saw this documentary and I have to tell you that I'm becoming a bigger Michael Moore fan with each project he releases.  I loved his latest book, ""Stupid White Men"" and his series, ""The Awful Truth"", was a riot.  This documentary tackles the serious issue of gun control.  While there are very somber moments throughout the film due to the subject matter, Moore also uses humor to get his point across.  And there are scenes in the documentary that are worth the price of admission alone.  When he visits Charleton Heston, for example, it is pure pleasure to see Heston squirming in his seat by the end of the interview when Moore starts asking him questions that he can't answer.  Another interesting interview is with Terry Nichols, one of the men charged in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.  I won't go into details about it but its funny as well.  He gives lots of information about death by guns---the U. S. has an astronomically high rate of around 11,000 a year as compared to, for example, Japan which has 39 deaths.  While there is no easy answer to this huge problem, at least this documentary addresses the issue and gets people to talking about it.  Upon leaving the cinema I heard several groups of people discussing their views on the film and it's subject matter and that is what a director wants to achieve out of his/her film.  Well, done, Mr. Moore.  I look forward to your next take on our society.";Moore bowls a perfect game!
476;163.0;3.0;14.0;"Michael Moore certainly knows how to put together an entertaining and persuasive documentary. When you leave the theater after this one, however, if you really think about what you've seen rather then simply respond on cue to the implied message, you are left with more questions than answers. Moore seems intent on blaming the NRA and the generally paranoid and gun-crazy tendency of America for events such as Columbine, but he doesn't make much of a case for this. He is mostly content to bombard us with interviews and confrontations in which his intended audience (mainly liberal, upscale and urban) can be relied upon to draw the appropriate conclusions. Where I saw the film, for instance, the audience snickered on cue when camouflage-clad militia men defended their right to bear arms. Dismissive laughter also ensued whenever President Bush or NRA president Charlton Heston appeared on screen. I am not a supporter of either Bush or the NRA, but I resent being manipulated by such tactics, especially when the issue is so complex. Moore himself presents evidence that calls into question some of his (mostly unstated) conclusions. He reveals, for example, that Canadians are just as fond of guns (as well as violent movies) as Americans. So why is their murder rate so much lower? The question remains unanswered. Fair enough --there may not be a simple answer, but the overall tone of this film would have you assume that guns are the essence of the problem. Moore may be more on target (pun intended) when he points out the hypocrisy of President Clinton talking about the tragedy of Columbine at the same time he is authorizing the killing of civilians in Kosovo. No doubt some people will be offended by the portrayal of the U.S. as essentially an aggressive, violent nation, but it's hard to argue with the history of the last fifty years. Moore has created an engaging, informative documentary. I only wish he had presented the material more evenly. At one point, the brother of one of Timothy McVeigh's associates (who was arrrested in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing but had the charges against him dropped), a tofu farmer, is interviewed. Once again, the audience laughed at his supposedly paranoid rantings about the people's right to oppose their government. Later in the film, Moore interviews Marilyn Manson, who sounds articulate and lucid compared to many of the rural right-wing types who preceded him. Of course, this is Moore's film and he has a great deal to say about how his subjects come across. He never confronts Manson about the role his music or lyrics may have played in the lives of the Columbine shooters (who, it is said, listened to Manson). This possible influence is dismissed as beneath consideration. By contrast, when Moore briefly interviews Charlton Heston, he seems callous about Columbine as well as the site of another shooting where Heston appeared at an NRA rally. Heston walks away as Moore tries to show him the photo of a murdered girl. This is effective propaganda, but it proves nothing; we can hardly expect Heston to take responsibility for every shooting that takes place. Interestingly, Moore reveals that he himself is an NRA member, but never elaborates on the reason for this. Bowling For Columbine (the title comes from the fact that the Columbine students went bowling before their shooting spree) is an interesting, though far from conclusive study on gun violence in America. Moore presents enough material to allow you to draw your own conclusions, as long as you don't passively absorb his biases.";Engaging, biased documentary on gun violence
479;164.0;4.0;14.0;"""Bowling for Columbine,"" a documentary by Michael Moore, alludes to the tragic mass murder at Columbine High School in its title. Much of the film is about gun violence and gun ""culture"" in the United States, but the film also explores other related issues: racism, the role of the media, weapons of mass destruction, etc.\nAlong the way, Moore incorporates an interesting medley of material: old TV commercials, a clip from a comedy concert, promotional film, etc. Much of the film consists of interviews with various people: an official from a school touched by gun violence, controversial singer Marilyn Manson, one of the makers of the TV show COPS, survivors of the Columbine massacre, etc.\nDespite the deadly seriousness of his material, Moore uses a lot of humor throughout the film. Some of his interviewees seem to be unintentionally funny--and disturbingly so. Much of the film is also very moving, and even heartbreaking; a couple of interviewees nearly break down and cry on camera.\nMoore is a bi-partisan political gadfly in this film, criticizing both Democratic and Republican political administrations with venom. The film is not without flaws. Some of Moore's segments feel too much like ""Candid Camera""-esque ""gotcha!"" stunts. And some of his political ranting seems to be insufficiently backed by comprehensive data.\nStill, ""Bowling"" is an undeniably gripping and thought-provoking documentary film. I see Moore as a real champion of the First Amendment, and I admire him for asking some really disturbing questions--and for not flinching when he gets disturbing answers. The whole film seems to build up to Moore's climactic interview with Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association; this part of the film is truly disturbing and at times painful to watch. Whatever your position on gun control and related issues, I recommend this intriguing film as food for thought.";A thought-provoking look at the American psyche

Ron Hubbard's Dianetics but at least I learned some interesting words from it.\n\nThe title itself ""Bowling for Columbine"", taken from the two shooters supposedly ""bowling"" before the killing spree with ahem guns (right Michael? Guns?) and oh yeah a tank of propane, some other utensils, is simlpy and factually incorrect. They didn't really go ""Bowling for Columbine"". Ha ha, but how cute. They first did something so innocuous as ""bowl"" then blammo, this permissive society which ALLOWS and GUARANTEES from the FOUNDING FATHERS and the CONSTITUTION the right to keep and bear arms caused these sweet little otherwise innocent little children to destroy, murder and kill. If Moore, or anyone walking away from this movie, actually thinks that these nutcases couldn't have successfully harmed as many if not more people without the use of guns, is truly on crack. To charaterize this show as anything more than a docudrama would give documentaries a bad name.\n\nOh there are facts in the story. But the items that make you go ""wow"" and ""are you kidding me"" are more than likely wholly made up to make you have an emotional reaction (the effect) instead of for enlightenment (the goal).\n\nBut as Moore has shown throughout his career, he cares little about getting facts right in his dramas.\n\nSome of us care little for the taste of Moore's, or anyone elses, lies presented as truth.\n\nI must add, to compare how safe Canada is to the US and make the quantum leap to imply ""golly, I wish the US was more like Canada"" makes me want to urge every US citizen to visit Canada at least once (for an extended period if you can stand it). Then, on returning, ask yourself, do you really want things in the US to be like Canada? If so, move there ... please. Or, barring that, never, ever vote in this country again. You can leave your doors unlocked at night in Canada. Who cares?\n\nOh also, for my review of this movie for the more gullible among us, the review is criticized by someone from a country where freedom is not really on the march, Viet Nam? Oh my. Gun control really worked in that country didn't it? It allowed such good things to happen to the inhabitants of that country, the epitomy of peace, prosperity and freedom in the world. If you sir are indeed from Viet Nam, then you sir are the moron (or an uneducated peasant working in the fields being watched over by your gun toting military).\n\nSince I'm giving history lessons freely, the ""well regulated militia"" clause refers to every sensible gun owner can own them but are governed by laws regulating them; don't confuse that with the ones that take them away, ok?\n\nEvery citizen of the US can become part of a ""militia"" if ever that becomes necessary. But only if you have not allowed the government or some dissengenuous film maker leading us to a point where we give up our rights to keep and bear arms.\n\nThat's the brain rot in this movie.

78;166.0;1.0;13.0;This movie should be rated fantasy. Michael Moore trys to make everyone accountable except the people, who need to be accountable for their own actions.

She was staying at her brothers, no dad in the picture, and she was on a government program for assistance. He questioned Clark stating, don't you feel responsible for this, if she didn't have to work, this wouldn't happen. How about- she shouldn't have slept around, or maybe continued with school, or maybe had a place of her own, or maybe spoke with her brother if any guns were around, or maybe spoke to son about playing with them.

145;167.0;1.0;13.0;There are many problems with not only the facts of the movie, but also the editing, and the rambling done by the film's director, Michael Moore.  In the end the film was way too long and the film contradicted itself more times than it didn't.  Moore gives no answer to certain problems that the U.S. has, but instead many - and they all contradict each other.  He seems to take every chance he has to put down the U.S. and exagerates the problems that it has.  I would say that this film is also anti-American, but constructive criticism has always been a very American thing to do.  However, this criticism is not constructive but instead somewhat nutty.  Moore seems to enjoy hearing himself talk.  I think he has more personal problems than the U.S. has as a country.  Perhaps his next film should be about how he has turned out the way he has?;Bowling For Columbine

181;169.0;5.0;13.0;"I have to say that this documentary that I saw just last week ""Bowling For Columbine"" was a very big eye opener for me. In a lot of ways, I was already aware of the fact that guns in America are very prevalent in our society and culture but you won't believe how easy it was to actually buy the ammo for these things. Just watch the documentary and see for yourself at what I'm saying here.\n Another thing to look at is the dire gap between the rich and the poor, even between the upper and lower class workers in the same building. You got the story of an impoverished mother who worked two jobs just to make ends meet and even then she was in danger of losing her home because she could no longer afford it and would go for an 80 mile bus trip every day to work at a fancy Dick Clark restaurant and her son got a hold of the gun that was used in the shooting in Flint, Michigan a few years ago. I was absolutely heartbroken by the news of that. When I watched this, I lost all my respect for Dick Clark when seeing htis and it's absolutely a shame how so many rich guys just contribute almost nothing to less fortunate sectors of society although there are some exceptions.\n Michael Moore to me is a true hero in our society. He aims to expose the truth and go deep into the roots of such problems like our dangerous obsession with guns. Included in this documentary are footage of Moore with two COlumbine survivors one of whom lost the use of his legs and the other still has some bullets embedded within his body. It's really heartbreaking but it's true. I lost all my respect for Charlton Heston when seeing this too.\nI'm not saying that I support the idea that they should get all guns away from citizens because I believe that we all have the right to bear arms but a part of me thinks that we have become a really violent society that is obsessed with guns and shoot-em-up games and gore.\n Go and see this documentary. It will piss you off, it will make you think hard but it will ultimately be a very rewarding watch as it delves deep beyond what news channels funnel into our minds.\n\n Michael Moore, you are great!";This is a really excellent insight into our love 4 guns

It's interesting because they didn't watch the movie, they simply tuned it out due to their ridiculous misconceptions (and since Moore isn't too popular, they probably had to go out of their way to even see this film).  I will agree that the issue of gun control was confronted as one of the many possible reasons for violence in this country.  Ultimately, though, Moore shows this to be highly unlikely.  Yes, Moore himself argues against guns being the reason for so much violence in this country.  Micheal Moore is a genius and he presents his arguments in a valid fashion.  Not only is this movie informative, but it may well be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.;Why do people say it's about gun control?

I may not be using the right words as I am not a journalist or writer, but he touches on some very important subjects, and tries to get to the heart of the problem of why there are so many gun murders in America.\nHis research as always is invaluable! I believe that not just every American should watch this movie, but people from all over the world. There is a lot to learn from it, and a lot to question, as to how our lives are being controlled by the people who make things the way ""they"" want them. From the NRA and gun laws, the media, poverty, racism, and mutlimillion dollar coroporations, and most importantly the people with power, he covers it all to help us see the contributing factors to the reasons American people arm themselves and kill other people.\nOther than just enjoying the movie I hope this will help educate people, and make everybody more aware!\nI look forward to seeing more of his work in the future!";Absolutely Amazing!!!!!

441;185.0;3.0;13.0;"""Bowling for Columbine"" is only as enlightening as the viewer is unenlightened. I suppose that might be true for most films, but especially here; independent filmmaker Michael Moore isn't telling me anything I didn't already know about guns, fear and violence in America. The film is a handy, humorous summation of the sad truth, but it lacks the ability to outrage and uncover like Moore's ""Roger & Me"" did in the 1980s.\n\nMoore, who is a little too ""unassuming"" for my taste, especially when he conducts cheap, calculated interviews, does do one thing very well: He captures what it is to live amongst violent elements in America. He visits a gun survivalist training camp, where he finds middle class men firing semi-automatic weapons because, maybe, they can. He interviews high school dropouts who built bombs out of boredom. He goes to Canada and discovers that people just aren't as afraid up there. And he skewers the news media, especially local television stations, which amp up everyone's fear of violence nationwide through bleeding, leading stories even though crime stats show that many crimes have been reduced in the last decade. Moore also tries to cobble some kind of real argument against the NRA without using the gun availability argument -- Moore believes it isn't the problem -- and fails, mostly because, if gun availability isn't the problem, then there is little you can pin on the NRA outside of insensitivity.\n At times, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is funny, at times it's ridiculous, and at times it's inspiring -- as when K-Mart agrees to discontinue the sale of ammunition because Moore trots a few Columbine victims in front of them.\nAnd at the end it's cruel, as Moore arrives at close to dawn to launch a two-minute attack on NRA president Charlton Heston, already suffering from Alzheimer's, by peppering him with ridiculous questions about why Heston showed up in Denver and Flint, Mich., days after school shooting tragedies. Moore dives into Heston so fast that he ravages the actor for thinking America's violent history and mixed ethnicity might have something to do with our modern gun violence.\nIt is the ""mixed ethnicity"" comments that NRA watchdogs and liberals pounced on -- they wanted to paint Heston was a racist gun goon, I guess -- but to argue that racism has played no role in this nation's violent upbringing is to swear off reality. I'm sure Moore thinks he's pulled a fast one on Ol Moses, but friends I've spoken with since I've seen the movie were split 50/50 on Moore's questionable ethics in that scene.\n ""Bowling for Columbine"" was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Well of course it was, and so it will be all over the world -- the movie is a firm indictment of America's cavalier attitude toward death and violence. It is our greatest problem. ""Bowling for Columbine"" states that fact, and if there are Americans who weren't worried before, may they see this movie and become worried.\n From my own vantage point, I fear Moore's pissed and scared off so much of the pertinent establishment in America that he will live out his career interviewing high school dropouts and bullying Dick Clark as Clark zooms away in a promo van. We can jeer and laugh for a little bit, and Moore might even win the (da da da dum!) Academy Award for this film, but he's painting himself into a jester's corner and, eventually, the crowd is going to file away.";Reinventing the wheel?

How can someone who proclaims such loyalty to progressive causes throw his support behind a former general who was the commander of the very war Michael Moore criticized as being a ""slaughter"".  He rightfully and harshly condemned the unilateral aggression of this country in Kosovo, but then praises and endorses the man who prosecuted it.

He is now more concerned with supporting the Establishment candidates and could care less about whether that person has any true beliefs and convictions about core progressive causes.\nHe is all talk.

237;195.0;1.0;12.0;"Since I turned off television, 2 years ago and my brain began to regenerate, I began to morph from a consumer into a researcher--you know the most feared by the corporatites.  As I read magazines, op ed pieces, books, and internet sites, I began to discover a whole new world, specifically the New World Order.  What is it?  Well, it is plans to put us into a world government top-down structure, not bottom-up structure as we were led to believe we were already living in.  You think the United States, you think Democracy.  Wrong, no Democracy, and soon to be no United States.  If you don't believe me, turn off your ""reality"" TV shows and start reading or at least listening if you don't read and very few of us can and do any more.\nSo what's this got to do with Michael Moore's highly acclaimed ""Bowling for Columbine.""  AK-47s.  Indeed with great horror the leftist gun control hawks (undercover for the New World Order guys) says ""All those instruments of mass distraction do, is kill humans and are not necessary to kill those sweet little animals we all know and love to eat.""  So what, so if you have a dictatorship with highly protected body armor, you want a 22 rifle or you want an AK 47?\nIt is ridiculous to take a few incidents like Columbine as proof of the need for ""gun control."" Indeed, the more out-field types of researchers believe incidents such as Columbine and 911 were planned and financed by the New World Order elites (hidden ever to carefully like the Wizard of Oz) to provoke rabble roosters to demand a gun-free (especially AK-47) United States.  Though, I must admit, Michael did show in the film that the real cause for the violence in the United States is the pitiful horror shows pawned off as television news.  To try to condition us to believe, that we are too dumb to have guns in our households where ""children"" might get hold of them is the highest form of idiocy unless our children have all turned into idiots.  Growing up in the Texas, our father was known (from the day I first understood language) to always keep a fully loaded gun behind most doors. He had a shot gun and several 22s.  We had chickens and we ate chickens and so did our friendly neighbors, the raccoons, the possums, and the ring-tail cats.  Those neighbors made nightly forays into the chicken house and my father made nightly forays on the neighbors.  Awful society, don't you agree?  Should have had gun control.  In Jim Hightower's book, ""Theves in High Places"" you will well see that our neighbors in ""federal government"" have been raiding our chicken house and rather badly, so I don't expect we will have many chickens in our pots.  So, if a ""liberal"" writer says all those guns are bad, I will automatically know that he is undercover ""raccoon, possum or ring-tail cat.""  With the new American Union already underway with the eventual elimination of our Bill of Rights and Constitution,  the protection of the ""right to bear arms, even AK-47s and tanks should be the very first thing we do each and every day from here on until the police and army of any nation switch from gun and bomb fondling to actual peacekeepers who work on managing earth to grow food and forest for everyone, even Iraqis and maybe a little for raccoons too. The other part of our day should be spent in working to vote everyone, I mean, everyone presently in office out of office peacefully, (after we  wrest the voting machines out of Diebold and their cohorts sticky fixed-election corporate voting hands) except maybe Dennis Kucinich (though misguided as to the gun issue).  We should retain those who voted against the war against Iraq or the $87 billion grant to Halliburton to ""rejoin what man (particularly Halliburton man, Dick Cheney)  had set asunder.""  We the People need a defense against a tyranical government.  Didn't our founding fathers know that and why don't we know it today and why do we have to repeat history?  George the England king or George the United States  king, ironic, right, just like 911.  Our first way to vote, of course, is to get the attention of executives of the global corporations with our spending habits.  Buy at least mininum-wage produced products, write corps, tell them you don't buy ""Made in China"" at 20 cents a day or why is the item not priced at 25 cents, tell Wal-Mart to put its bullets back in after you don't buy there, because it is stocked with Made in China, tell Dell and Hewlett Packard you will not use their off-shore tech support, etc., etc.  Do you think this review will be here tomorrow?\nSo if you have a little money to spend for ""education and/or entertainment,"" after Jim Hightower's book, start with Meria Heller at Meria.net where she has a book list.

Uncompromising in it's focus, you will be uncomfortable while viewing this film. You'll also laugh too. Moore takes several formats ranging from stock footage, historical data, and parody to weave this web, and once you're stuck in it there is no avoiding what he brings to your attention.\nAt the same time, this film really picks at (white) America's psyche in general and leaves you wondering how on earth our country has managed to make it this far.

490;204.0;5.0;12.0;"Wow, I saw this movie last night and thought it was extremely well done.  The message that Michael Moore is trying to send to America is very powerful and very justified.  Things are getting way out of hand.\nI am Canadian was thus was very interested in the parts of the movie that dealt with Canada, and a comparison of it with the United States.  I will say that Mr. Moore did exagerate in some areas - alot of us actually do lock our doors, and certainly there are worse neighbourhoods than what he showed us.  But still, in general his comparisons were fairly justified and clear.  The statistic that Canada had 165 gun related deaths last year, compared with almost 12000 gun deaths in the States in mindblowing!  Canada has only about 10-15% the population of the states, yet the US has almost 100 times the number of gun related deaths.  It's insane.\nCharlton Heston makes himself and the NRA in general look really bad as they callously discard the deaths of students in schools, and don't even want to listen to any kind of statements that might imply there is something wrong with guns.  My favourite Heston quote from the film, which is repeated several times, is ""from my dead hands"" (referring to what it will take to get him to discard his guns).  Like how hardcore can you be about guns, I don't understand.\nAlso Marilyn Manson was very well spoken and really came off well.  It's interesting that Marilyn Manson came off better than almost every other American they showed in the movie.\nI can only hope that many people go out and see this movie and take what it says to heart.  Bravo Mr. Moore.";Outstanding film!
494;205.0;5.0;12.0;"In his previous documentaries, ""Roger and me"" and ""The big One"", Michael Moore targeted some big company leaders (Roger Smith from General Motors, and Phil Knight from Nike) who's fired most of their workers and closed their factories on the U.S. territory while they made hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits - Moore himself used to be a worker in General Motors factory in his native city of Flint, Michigan -, the filmmaker extends his action field and, from the massacre in the Columbine high school, in Littleton, Colorado (where two kids armed from head to toe, killed twelve pupils and one teacher after a bowling game), deals with his whole country addicted to all kinds of fire guns, with an average - and amazing - result of over 11,600 people shot dead every year.\n'Whose fault is it, if the Americans are just a bunch of crazy cowboys?' Moore seems to ask in his film, edited like a documentary as well as an investigation. The fault of the whole political class, which organizes illegal destitutions all over the (third) world, finances and gives weapons to dictators and terrorists, sends bombs and missiles everywhere? Of the medias, which permanently keeps on an atmosphere of fear, suspicion and hate through violent and bloody pictures broadcasted daily, in the TV news, with an obvious commercial purpose? Of the poverty which hits mainly the Black people, who - as well as some hard rockers with weird figures and shapes, like Marilyn Manson - are put on an evil level in order to be used as guilty ones every time something wrong happens?\nFrom the supermarket of guns to the bank which gives a rifle as a gift when an account is opened, through an exhilarating cartoon in the ""South Park"" style, resuming in a few minutes the history of America, based upon fear, ignorance of the other in front and blood, the interviews of some teenagers at school, of some gun lovers (including Jerry Nichols, the brother of Terry, one of the two people who destroyed a building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people), who consider the carrying of guns as a duty and a responsibility, and of a disgusting Charlton Heston - he's the president of the NRA (National Rifle Association) which still keeps encouraging the free market of fire guns all over the country -, Michael Moore, within only two hours, manages to tell with strength and an undeniable humor about all the more serious problems in the so-called land of free and the result is an astounding shocker, a great demonstration of the American paranoia, the admittance of powerlessness of a whole manipulated country.

Michael Moore is the Big Bird of adult Sesame Street analysis - except Sesame Street is more even-handed. I don't own a gun, and don't like them. But this one-sided and misleadingly juxtaposed portrayal hardly helps anyone - except apparently Moore who seems unable to decide which side of the camera he's meant to be on. And that, it seems to me, is the core of the problem. This is less a documentary than a vehicle for Moore's self-important ""spin-doctoring."" One can tell something is amiss when the film gives the impression that the only intelligent people are those on its side. The epiphanic moment though, and the one which has forever diminished Moore for me, was the prolonged and shameful sequence in which he takes advantage of a Charleton Heston who was so obviously already sliding into dementia.

176;210.0;4.0;11.0;"Documentary film makers necessarily bring a certain point of view with them: it is there in the material they have selected, in what they show and do not show, in how they work their bits of film together to make a cohesive statement.  But while the vast majority of documentary film makers prefer to hide themselves behind the camera--and thus give the illusion of impartiality--Michael Moore does not.  Not only director but also narrator, interviewer, and visible front man, he has no qualm in letting you know right out of the gate that the point of view is his own from start to finish.\n\nMost people will probably agree that it is a gutsy thing to do, but that is probably ALL they are likely to agree upon about BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.  Ask ten people what the film is about and you are likely to get ten different answers.  Ask the same ten whether they liked it or not and you will probably get two extremes: they either loved it or they hated it.  Those who love it tend to champion it as a powerful statement in favor of gun control.  Those who hate it tend to consider it an inaccurate attack on gun owners in general and the NRA in particular.\n\nBut I think it is a mistake to see the film from either stance.  It is true that Moore has a lot to say about easy access to and irresponsible handling of firearms; it is also true that the NRA (not to mention then-president Charleton Heston) come in for a major beating at his hands.  But when all is said and done, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is no more ""about"" gun control or the NRA than it is about the infamous Columbine High School incident.  When you get right down to the marrow, Moore seems to be making a comment on how both politicians and corporations work to take advantage of the paranoia created in the citizenry by a mass media focused on what is sensational rather than upon what is actually important.\n\nThere has been a lot of complaints that Moore has fiddled the facts to suit his agenda and that BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is riddled with inaccuracies.  Indeed, there are entire websites (most of them little more than badly researched hysterical rants) devoted to the exposure of these flaws.  But whether or not you buy into all or even most of Moore's data, it does seem to me that he has a valid overall point.  To throw it out on the basis of surface errors--or still worse, the bizarre idea that documentaries should reside in some rarefied atmosphere of absolute impartiality--is an even greater error than any inaccuracy or bias that exists in the film itself.\n\nWhether you actually agree with the film or not, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is truly one film that will hold your attention to the bitter end: often laugh-out-loud funny, wildly satirical, bitterly ironic, opinionated, thought-provoking, and extremely disquieting, it makes a powerful statement.  But I do have one complaint, and it is a significant one.  Moore doesn't seem to communicate any consistent idea re what he thinks we should do about any of it.\n\nHow do we dispense with the media-fueled paranoia that leaves us vulnerable to corporate and political hucksters?  Obviously by critical rather than reactionary thinking, but this isn't really something that Moore specifically states in the course of the film.  Very well, but how do we break the cycle that encourages reactionary rather than critical thinking?  And to that question Moore has no answer at all.  When this open ended quality combines with the film's often brilliant but frequently scattered approach ... well, it just might leave you feeling none the wiser than you were when you came in.\n\nThe DVD comes with several extras, some of them very interesting--most particularly the ""Return to Denver/Littleton Featurette,"" an interview with Joe Lockart, and an interview with Charlie Rose.  Final thought: more than worth seeing, but one way or another your reaction is likely to extreme.\n\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer";A Divisive Film: No Opinion is not an Option

239;215.0;2.0;11.0;"Okay, Moore is indeed a clever and sometimes humorus guy.  And, he really covers a heck of alot of ground in this film. Where do I begin!  I mean, according to Moore, the NRA is just an offshoot of the KKK, the media has been busy frightening the average American with stories about invading killer bees, a corporate white collar crime reality show would be really alot more interesting than ""COPS"", America's past is tainted with more blood than Stalin's Russsia, we can't forget ENRON,white folks are armed to the teeth because they are scared of the black community, America is in grave economic decline, air pollution is killing us and we can't even arrest anybody for it, and Canada is really a much better place to live than America!  Phew!  That's quite a few topics to try to cover in just  over two hours.\nNow, in the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I am a proud member of the NRA.  When I decided to view this film, I was expecting a tirade against the right to bear arms.  Sure, Moore delivers plenty of that, but I was suprised by what else I saw - and how Moore continued to contradict himself.  Throughout the film, Moore admits that as handgun ownership increased in communities, crime rates actually went down.  He also notes that in Canada, despite high rates of firearm ownership, there is a much lower homocide rate than in the US.  So it isn't the guns.  Yet, despite these admissions, Moore continues to go back and indirectly blame the ""gun nuts"" at the NRA.\nOr does he?  Just when I was sure that Moore was blaming guns for EVERYTHING, he does go on to make a few points that I do agree with.  First of all, I agree with Moore in his contention that the mass media continually pumps the American public full of fear.  A quick look at the nightly news confirms this to be true.  So, for a time I'm finding some agreement with Moore.\nBut then he just goes off on another tangent about welfare, the greedy ""rich"", the defense industry, Bush, and of course the NRA.\nIf it sounds like this review isn't ordered and coherent, it's not.  And that's because the film wasn't either.  Moore just bounces around from topic to topic with no real direction - and, perhaps more importanly, without any meaningful conclusion.  I don't agree with Moore on most of his issues, and quite frankly, I think he's a rather dishonest guy.  But I do think there is SOME glimmer of insight here . . but Moore blows it.";Interesting, for a variety of reasons.

Here's another proof (if you needed one) that some people (including clever, educated and sophisticated people) will swallow anything and give it a big thumbs-up, as long as it has bad things to say about Dubya and as long as it repeats tired mantras about evil American imperialism and capitalists stealing from the working people.\nAdd a generous helping of shallow rambling about race (apparently, America became rich through slavery), general failure to understand cause and effect in any social phenomenon, and the usual self-centered and self-important stage presence of the author, so often seen in poorly made documentaries, and you have a general description of this unberably boring, predictable and lame documentary.;Passionate rambling by a talentless well-meaning sad man

That said, I am also a gun owner and wouldn't consider for a moment giving up my guns.\nThis movie's facts in regards to the number of gun murders in the United States versus the other countries of the world should make anyone step back and ask themselves ""Why?"" Michael Moore takes us on a tour of what fuels the fears of Americans to motivate them to purchase weapons. We visit Colombine High School in Littleton, Colorado in the film, and Moore gives us some examples of extremes people go to in the efforts to prevent another massacre. We visit Flint, Michigan, and we learn about one 6 year old boy shooting a 6 year old girl in their classroom. Granted, most Americans find it inconvenient to think about the social aspects of our culture that do not help these stomach turning consequences, we must recognize how abnormal our relationship with violence and ""preemptive strikes"" truly are.\nI'm proud of Michael Moore for researching and showing us these events, though he may emphasize shock value a bit too much here and there - for example, the Great Lakes Crossing Mall is in a wealthy county in Michigan, but it is more or less an outlet mall in a very middle class/GM factory worker town. In a democracy, we can still love the USA and support our troops while questioning what we do - to call such questions unpatriotic is vitriolic and similar to an authoritarian view.  Until we're forced to wear Chairman Mao hats in this country, Michael Moore reminds us that we need to step out of the routine to recognize what has changed around us.";Beneath the shock value, he makes a good point.

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that all Americans have the right to own firearms, and that right shall not be infringed. I cannot believe that a democratic nation should allow something like gun control. I am also glad that our government is getting rid of it. America had as many guns before the increase in the crime rate, beginning in the 1960s, as it does today. The reason for the increase in our crime rate is because of the violence that is glorified in our video games. Moore's arguement against this is that Japan has more violent video games than the United States yet their crime rate is lower. But there is another part of the story that Moore does not tell us about. In recent years, many gruesome murders have taken place in Japan, all committed with samurai swords (the weapons used in most of Japan's video games). Don't sacrifice our rights to gun ownership.

While there still remain plenty of places you can go for soul food, spiritual nourishment, and artistic inspiration, there are few contemporary popular media creations that will affect you the way Michael Moore's do. From his early films such as Roger and Me and Canadian Bacon, to his latest book Stupid White Men and his next film project on alleged links between Bush Se&ntilde;or and bin Laden, Moore's style of identifying socially relevant issues and painting poignant contrasts that shatter popular perceptions has become increasingly penetrating and compelling.\nBowling for Columbine is an exploration into American values, culture and character. An association of the title can be drawn with the hunting expression ""Out for Bear/blood/etc.,"" and while it fits, as if it were an answer to a Mensa word puzzle  -a mark of Moore's wry wit- it is just the beginning, a carnival barker's invitation to come in and be entertained. This film is a collage of various perspectives on the gun issue which Moore assembled in his pursuit of some sort of answer to a situation that culminated in the murders at Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado. The reference to bowling is not flippant, there is a link to the dictators of that fateful day and perhaps into their machinations.\nFrom an  icy quote by Charleton Heston, ""From my cold...dead...hands!"", which Heston pronounces at an NRA meeting to express his loathing to let go his guns, to the heart wrenching story of kindergarten tragedy, Moore makes numerous stops in likely and not so likely locales, looking for clues as to why more than one person is murdered every single hour of every single day, by gun, in the USA. He travels to Littleton to talk to former classmates of the killers, and he travels to Toronto, to get a glimpse of what he sees as successful public housing and to see whether people actually do (can you believe it?), leave their doors unlocked. He even hits small town (Tim Horton's parking lot), Ontario for some down home takes on why there are fewer gun problems in Canada. We hear victims' perspectives and we witness their mission to regulate ammunition sales by petitioning a major American retailer. It's a daunting challenge, fraught with similar obstacles to those into which Moore ran when he dogged Roger Smith, former CEO of GM.\nCritics attack the veracity of Moore's sources and the accuracy of some of his statistics. They charge that some of the scences were set up or directed and that ""things are not as they appear"". I did check one criticism that an airline employee made regarding a statement in Stupid White Men. I went to an official air industry website and Moore's figure stood shining. I haven't heard Moore's responses either, and I don't anticipate them.  Moore is driven and he wouldn't waste the time. He's pushing as fast and as hard as he can to help the world get a new pair of glasses.\nI'm looking forward to this special edition import and -I don't like to say it- would pay double the price for it. I have seen the film and\nI will watch it again, but not for its cleverness or special FX or its cinematography, but because I believe that what I am seeing is minimally packaged. In an age where digital enhancement is the rage, and Television and Hollywood take viewers to ever higher limits of distraction and illusion, Michael Moore has his feet on the ground, the mic in his hand, and nothing but questions. The merits of Bowling for Columbine lie in the frankness, humility and simplicity with which the gun issue is presented. One of the strongest notions that I've been struck with in reading and listening to Moore is that he is doing this for the common good. He is trying to help people, and in particular he is trying to help people who need it, which is most of us. That's why I want to support Michael Moore. He's not a powerful man, but he has an important message, and it's gaining momentum. He doesn't pretend to be more clever than anyone, he's just passionate about the truth and he's relentless in his pursuit of it. I'm sure to some he's a nuisance, and to others he's a thorn. But to\nme he's fresh air. About as fresh as you can get in these days of smog, gobal warming, and empty political rhetoric.\nI'm curious to see what's included in this special import edition. Michael Moore has a lot of experience and I trust he'll make it worth the money. Its message may not be as universally accessible as Beethoven's Fifth, or as simple to understand as Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, but it does raise an issue that affects all of us, and which needs to be addressed, and which is a matter of life and death.";Still looking for a hero?

468;227.0;5.0;11.0;Bowling For Columbine may be a documentary but it certainly makes its way into my top 5 films of last year.  In it, Michael Moore tackles the potentially enormous and, ultimately unanswerable, question of why is there so much violence in America?  Focusing on the tragedy at Columbine as well as the shooting of a six year-old girl by one of her classmates in Flint, Michegan, near Moore's hometown, with an eye to global terrorism this is a powerful film.\nSurprisingly there's a lot of humour to be made from the humour, although admitedly much of this is lamentable, laughter being focused firmly on the ridiculous and absurd rather than anything Moore says himself.  He chooses his subjects carefully and lets them do the talking, and from a teenager who's upset that he didn't make No. 1 on a potential bomb-threat list at his high school to a hilarious cartoon take on the origins of violence in America, this will make you laugh out loud more than once.  Of course, much of the laughter may be slightly uneasy given not only the subject matter but also because much of it is of the kind where you will be gasping because you can't quite believe it.  Take for instance, the opening sequence where Moore opens up a bank account and receives a free gun with a background check that only appears to involve him ticking a few boxes.\nWhat came as a surprise to me though, although perhaps looking back at it this was naive, was how political this documentary is.  Several interesting points are made, backed up by admitedly blinkered statistics, but they are still shocking nonetheless.  Of particular note is Marilyn Manson's take on the matter, pointing his finger at world affairs rather than heavy metal music.  Understandably much of the film's appeal may well lay in to what extent you agree with Moore's political views.\nHowever, the main point is that these were genuinely tragic events that Moore finds himself unable to find a satisfactory explanation for, although he explores several avenues.  Such scenes as the security footage of Columbine at the time of the school shooting is some of the most horrendously affecting footage I've seen on film in a while.  The lasting impression seems to be one of despair rather than hope, and this more than anything else, perhaps explains the desperation and violence inherent in society we live in.;One of the best films of last year
487;228.0;3.0;11.0;"This movie is too scattered to offend or persuade anyone. It bludgeons the emotions like ""Titanic"" or ""ET,"" and it has about as much to say. That's why viewers gave it rave reviews and reviewers were lukewarm. I saw it with several other people, and it didn't raise any questions or discussion except for its the strange shortcomings. So bring a date and an extra hanky, it's a great date movie that's guaranteed to not spark an arguement. Everybody likes candy, just don't pretend it's health food.\nMoore is at his best describing mid-western life or skewering the media. But Moore is supsiciously like Rush Limbaugh.  Moore and Rush are both chubby little media conglomerates, who are effective at skewering the rest of the media's bias and shortcomings (not exactly heavy lifting) even though each of them bombards his loyal audience (Rush's dittoheads, Moore's ???) with diatribes that are heavy on style, short on facts, and always pushing their own fear-driven agenda about US foriegn policy. In a very real sense, Michael Moore has become the kind of media spawn that he and his viewers supposedly hate and distrust.\nMoore's worst is when he says repeatedly that Clinton bombed Kosovo the day of Columbine, and that the Columbine shooters may have been inspired by the bombing. Also, his pointed questions in ""earnest"" puzzled tones worked well when he was needling GM, but when Moore uses exactly the same ""earnest"" tone with shooting victims he's just creepy. Letterman can go convincingly from wiseguy to sincere on a live show, but Moore can't pull that off even with post-production edits, showing his limitation as an interviewer. Another segment described the woman whose 6 year old shot a classmate while she was in a work-to-welfare program. Moore goes on and on about her ""40 mile commute."" Later we see the charter bus the state provided, and the mall where she worked. Sad story, but not the Middle Passage. Moore trying to link Dick Clark to the shooting was like playing ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,""  and his interview of Charlton Heston confirms that Moore isn't afraid of intellectual sparring with 80 year old celebrity spokesmen. And his depiction of Canada is very unrealistic (I've lived there).\n""Columbine"" touches on teen alienation and despair in the American consumer culture. Strangely, Moore leaves out issues like Ritalin side-effects, toxic teen sexual relationships, child abuse, and the strings of copy-cat shootings that follow intense media coverage.\nMoore also grills a Lockheed-Martin employee (Columbine's biggest employer) about the missiles they make, and asks if it isn't natural for kids to go on a shooting spree because of their anguish over US foriegn policy. People who weren't embarassed for Moore should listen to performance artist Jello Biafra talk about Columbine in ""Hellburbia"" on ""Become the Media."" As Biafra (who grew up near Littleton CO) points out, this was an affluent community of aerospace workers who were mainly evangelicals (people who can pass Defense Dept security polygraphs)whose kids thought the few ""wierdos"" (kids that listened to rock & roll) were ""ruining"" their envangelical public school. Biafra also tackles issues like child abuse and the attraction of becoming an international celebrity by bringing a gun to school. Biafra shares the same political views as Moore, but in 27 minutes he leaves Moore in the dust.\nMoore describes gun owners as brain-damaged cowardly racists in constant fear of media-hyped street crime and minorities (those sinister ""other"" people) although he doesn't explain why gun culture is strongest in the areas with fewest minorities. It would be interesting to hold a mirror up to this movie, and see if gun-haters live in constant fear of media-hyped shooting sprees and if for them the sinister ""others"" are rural gun owners. Nope, that would be too complex and potentially ambiguous for Moore, just like sending him and Rush on a blind date.";Moore - Rush Limbaugh of the Left
489;229.0;5.0;11.0;*****\nI was lucky enough to catch Mike's new film yesterday in Seattle, and spent the entire two hours alternately laughing, crying, and gnashing my teeth. Mike takes a comically painful look at America's proclivity for violence and dares to ask the question 'why?'\nSome say that we have more guns laying around, or that we watch too many bloody movies, play too graphic video games... Others point out that the Country was built on Native genocide and Slave labor.\nIn Mike's analysis, that just doesn't add up. The rest of the Western World - and especially Canada - intake just as much violent entertainment, have just as many guns laying around, and have just as much national history of indiscriminate killing and subjugation of other races. What makes us so special when it comes to American gun deaths and our export of violence to the rest of the World?\nThis film is not anti-gun, it is pro-reality. Everyone in America deserves to be exposed to the ideas and questions posed by this film. It will make you wonder why you lock your doors at night, and steer clear of the 'wrong side of town' - for a whole new set of reasons.\nA truly remarkable film. I would watch it 10 more times if it was still playing....;Are You Scared Yet?  They Hope So.
493;230.0;5.0;11.0;I just went to see Bowling for Columbine for the second time this morning. Of the numberous films I have seen here at the BIFF film festival in Bergen, Norway, this is the best one. As a Norwegian, I felt that the film made an extremely well presented, original point of view about consumer fear, not only viable in the States, but also here in Norway. Even though Marilyn Manson makes only a brief appearance in the film, it is an amazing moment when Moore asks Manson what he would like to say to the Columbine-kids, had he been given the chance to speak directly to them. He replied: 'I wouldn't say anything. I would listen to what they have to say.' How ironic that the person who was being indirectly blamed for influencing the Columbine-killers into executing the murders, is also the only one in the film touching on what may solve the problem with violence and fear: communication, not guns. I am deeply touched and exited about this film, and I recommend everyone to go see it. If not, you will miss out on one of the most original and powerful point of views constructed about a world (at least according to the media) gone mad.;Moore and Marilyn Manson tell the truth about American fear
27;231.0;1.0;9.0;"...you already know that one must consider the semiotics of exclusionism in order to fully understand Michael Moore's witticisms. But let me add that Michael lies routinely -- even under oath. I will start this discussion by arguing that ""oligophrenic"" hardly seems like a strong enough word to describe Michael. Then, I will present evidence that Michael is unable to support his assertions with documentation of any sort. Once we realize that, what do we do? The appropriate thing, in my judgment, is to clarify and correct some of the inaccuracies present in Michael's canards. I say that because to believe that he is the ultimate authority on what's right and what's wrong is to deceive ourselves. Ancient Greek dramatists discerned a peculiar virtue in being tragic. Michael would do well to realize that they never discerned any virtue in being unconscionable.\n\nMichael's rejoinders are like an enormous barbarism-spewing machine. We must begin dismantling that structure. We must put a monkey wrench in its gears. And we must improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come, because Michael has a one-track mind. That's clear. But either Michael has no real conception of the sweep of history, or he is merely intent on winning some debating pin by trying to pierce a hole in my logic with ""facts"" that are taken out of context. Now that this review is over, I pray that my logic and passion have convinced you that the most myopic person non grat I've ever seen thrive when the rest of us underestimate the threat they pose or are too weak or unorganized to hold the line.";Unless you're a newly hatched pod person...
56;232.0;1.0;10.0;The kindest thing I can say about this particular movie is that it suffers from a lack of the truth.  It attempts to blame everyone from the Lockheed Corporation to the NRA for the sudden upswing in school violence over the years, and it fails rather miserably.  The editing is done in such a way that the true message of some who appeared in it (like Charlton Heston, for example) is completely twisted around.  Overall, I'd say save your money and get this from your local library.  If you've spent the money, then get a refund.;Not funny at all
60;233.0;1.0;10.0;THIS ONLY GETS MORONS THINKING. First of all, Michael Moore only gives half truths in his statistics. The sources he used were varied and some of the numbers (i.e. gun murders in the United States)were just flat out wrong (unlike Mr. Moore, I checked my sources). He also cuts and pastes things out of their original context. For example, the political rally in that Charlton Heston was attending was months after the shooting not 48 hours after. And oddly enough, Michael Moore was in the same area in a political rally himself at the same time Heston was. The cartoon on the lies about the NRA was not made by the makers of South Park, but he really did do a good job in making you think it was. The cartoon was also riddled with innacuracy. This is propaganda that would make Joseph Goebbels look like Jesus.;If You're Stupid, You'll Like This

96;235.0;4.0;10.0;Regardless of how I feel about this film I would like to point out to many of those who have given 1 star, that the main conclusion Moore draws at the end of the film is that it is the culture in modern America that is the primary cause of events like Columbine yet the majority of these reviewers are arguing against his points about tighter gun controls. Although he argues for this it is not the crux of his point but rather the culture of fear in U.S society that is relatively absent in countries like Canada that means that similar numbers of guns  create very disimilar numbers of gun crimes.\n\nI also thought it amusing the number of people who resorted to criticising the man's obesity...I wasn't aware that a persons weight was legitimate reason to denigrate his political and social analytical skills...smacks somewhat of bitterness methinks!;Errrm, I think you've missed the point...
151;236.0;2.0;10.0;"Bowling For Columbine is probably one of the most famous ""documentaries"" of this day and age. Michael Moore obviously has some skill at both making a film and making at point, and boy what a point does he make. In this ""fact-based"" documentary, he praises Canada, denounces the American Gun Culture, ""exposes"" the racism in the media and in the country, and generally lets us know how dumb our presidents are, all in the interest of showing us why the Columbine Shootings occured. A valid point, and definately a topic worthy of a documentary.\nUnfortunately, Moore ruins it. He uses all his talent at film making and editing to splice together (he calls it shortening) speeches so that the viewer only sees what he wants them to see. Statistics presented in the movie are not grounded in fact. At one point, he ADDS WORDS to an old political commercial in order to make it look like something it was not. The ""documentary"" is filled with lies and falsehoods. There are many websites which can explain this in greater detail, although I reccommend [...] since it's more concise.\nIn short, this ""documentary"" is a good example of film technique, with masterful edits and a good combination of montages and animation. It's also a good example of how to use good film technique to decieve an audience and make a point at any cost by any means.";Bowling For Columbine- An good example of bad use of Talent
31;237.0;3.0;9.0;"Bowling for Columbine wasn't as overtly partisan as I expected it to be, but it definitely had points that Moore wanted to hammer home.  The question he reverted to over and over in the film was, why is there so much gun violence in the US as opposed to other countries, and Canada was used as the main comparison.  He doesn't really want to find out the answer, because he already has his own answer in mind and he constructs the film to fit around this view.  Moore does an excellent job of playing Joe Schlub, walking around and gently prodding people to say what he wants them to say, all the while acting as if he's just Mike from down the street and is curious to find out about gun violence.\n\nHe interviews men from the Michigan Militia, James Nichols, and some guys in Oscoda, MI, where one of the Columbine shooters had spent some time.  Of course these guys he interviews aren't exactly the smartest guys he can find, and Nichols comes off as a borderline wacko, but Moore paints them as the stereotypical gun owners.  He devotes a section of the movie to Columbine and we see the distorted and out of context footage of Charleton Heston speaking at an NRA rally.  When talking with Heston at the end of the movie, and at a couple other points, Moore takes care to mention that he is a card carrying member of the NRA, as if to prove to the viewer that he's not only impartial to the gun issue, but so distressed about it that he is more than willing to give the NRA a fair shake.\n\nHalfway through the ""documentary"", there's a five minute cartoon depicting Moore's view of America's love affair with the gun, and his answer to the central question of the movie.  Basically, Moore believes that white people have used the gun primarily to murder minorities and/or steal their land, and this connection between whites, minorities, and guns continues to this day.  Although he never says this, the subcontext of the movie is that whites are the only ones in this country that are concerned about their 2nd Amendment rights, and whites in the suburbs are the vast majority of gun owners (which may be true) and that these whites own guns because they live in a constant state of fear, primarily of black people.  Contrasting this with Canada, he interviews people there who say they have guns, then talks with law enforcement who have a hard time recalling any murders.  One man he speaks to in Windsor says the last gun murder he can remember in Windsor was 15-20 years ago.  He asks a half dozen Canadians if they lock their doors at night, and they answer that they don't, why would they?  One guy admits to someone breaking into his house when he wasn't home, but he shrugs it off by saying the intruder merely took some alcohol and cigarettes.  A woman says that one time she woke up and someone was in the house, but they didn't do anything and took off.  This woman says she still doesn't lock her doors at night, then goes on to say that Americans grab a gun at the first sign of a disagreement, as if that were the natural thing for them to do.  (I have a hard time believing that most Canadians have such a laissez faire attitude about home security.)\n\nThen we have the trip to K-mart HQ with Moore bringing two of the victims of Columbine, one in a wheelchair, where he successfully got K-mart to stop selling handgun ammunition, as if that was the reason behind the shootings.  Moore treats this as if it's going to save countless lives in the future.\n\nNear the end of the movie, Moore explores the shooting of the 6 year old girl in Flint by the 6 year old black boy.  This ends up being blamed on Michigan's welfare-to-work program because the boy's mother is forced to take a bus 40 miles each way from Flint to the Great Lakes Crossing mall in Auburn Hills for work.  Moore states, and I'm paraphrasing, ""She couldn't spend enough time with her children (apparently she had more than one kid) because she had to commute to work eighty miles round trip each day to make pastries for rich people""  At the GLC mall, she worked at Dick Clark's restaurant, so using Michael Moore logic, he knows what he has to do is confront Dick Clark.  Somehow he finds him (I'm assuming in L.A.) sitting in a minivan with a couple of other people getting ready to go somewhere, and he starts asking him about the girl who was shot in Flint, and how the shooter's mother was ""forced"" to work at his restaurant.  How Dick Clark is culpable in this, I'm still trying to figure out.  What Moore never mentions is the fact that when the boy's mother moved her son in with his brother, the brother was a drug dealer, and the boy found one of his guns.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Moore gets his interview with Charlton Heston.  I thought Heston conducted himself with much dignity and class, despite apparently being in the early stages of Alzheimers, and considering his company.  Moore asks him if he has guns in the house, Heston responds that he has loaded guns in the house, Moore asks why, and Heston responds because if he needs them they'll be ready, and that it's a right he's choosing to exercise.  Moore asks him if he's ever had his house broken in before and Heston says no. (As if that's enough reason to debunk owning a gun)  At the end of this exchange which Heston finally ends because he can wisely see that he and Moore are at odds with their views, Heston walks out and Moore follows, pulling out a picture of the 6 year old girl that was shot in Flint.  It was quite a display of using someone else's tragedy to further their own agenda.  Pretty sick.  Moore left the picture propped up against Heston's house on his way out.\n\nAfter seeing this, I could easily understand why the French gave Moore a ten minute standing ovation at one of their film awards ceremonies.  The film depicted gun owning Americans as white, racist, ignorant, mentally deficient yahoos who live in fear, own multiple guns, and will pull them out at the least provocation to ""protect their rights"" from enemies real and perceived.  Not ONCE does Moore talk about guns used by drug dealers, criminals, and other thugs in the commission of crimes.  Nor the high incidence of black-on-black gun violence.  And to think that Moore would actually give time to someone who saved their life or those of others by brandishing a firearm is laughable.  Moore is very good at attempting to give his film some credence by making it appear he's taking an objective look at gun violence, he enables those viewers who don't know much about him and his left wing bent, to easily come around to his viewpoint.  If I didn't know anything about the history of guns, or why the 2nd Amendment is so important, I imagine I could probably be persuaded after watching Bowling to think, hey, this guy's right, why are we so nuts about guns?";"""Bowling"" Skews the Gun Argument"
172;238.0;1.0;10.0;Moore has a unique ability to skew the truth to paint the picture he wants the world to see.  He makes no sound arguments.  All of his data is misleading and not correct.  The biggest problem here is the misconception that Gun Control is Crime Control.  If you research any of his facts with Federal Government's statistics on Gun related crime you will find huge disparities.  In the U.S. the states with the highest crime rates are those who also have the toughest Gun Control laws.  This movie might be good entertainment, but it is NOT a documentary for it relies on absolutely NO facts.;Horribly Inaccurate
174;239.0;5.0;10.0;"It's funny to me that some of the reviewers decided to give it 1 star based on their disagreement with him. More importantly however, they blindly bashed him for his opinions and depictions of such without ever debating. And in fact, this is what the movie partially is about - the ignorance and stupidity of the mainstream American population.\nNow I know that you conservatives from the small town USA love your guns and SUV's and like to blindly point to the ""The Right to bear Arms"" amendment in the Constitution, but this same amendment would also imply the possesions of such arms as nuclear weapons, as Michael Moore wisely pointed it out in his movie. But I guess the conservative logic doesn't extend this far...\nI also saw someone point out that Michael Moore gave statistics of the number of gun deaths in America in comparison to other countries, like Canada, France and England and that it's wrong because it's not per population. Well, you know what, a simple calculation in your tiny brains would suggest that even per population or per capita, America still has by far the highest crime rate by guns of all nations. Look on your atlases, see the population of those countries and then do a simple proportion... instead of distorting the truth!\nIt's true that Micheal Moore is a left winger, like Bush is a right winger, but that doesn't diminish the level of objectivity nor truth employed in this documentary. The numbers were real, the people were real and statistics were accurate and even more importantly it had an important and thought provoking thesis supported by solid facts and reality.\nAnd stop saying ""I am a proud member of NRA"", because it's just a stupid and meaningless thing to say. Anyone can join NRA, it doesn't take skills, nor talent to do that. So stop invoking ""pride"" into it, because remarks like those only further support the stereotype that Americans are an ignorant people.\nAll in all, it's a great movie that must be seen by all.";The truth starts here
178;240.0;1.0;10.0;"The big ""pro gun rally"" held in Michigan was actually a Get Out the Vote campaign that Heston spoke at with George W Bush, before the 2000 election.  This event was actually 8 months after Kayla Rowland was murdered, but Moore tells us that it was within days of the tragedy.  Al Gore was also in the area as well for this Get Out the Vote campaign, but I don't see any Republicans trying to blame Gore for what happened to Kayla.  It was just one stop in a whirlwind trip.  Later in the film when Moore interviews Heston, he asks him about the rally in Michigan, only he doesnt ask him why Heston held a ""pro gun rally"", he asked him why Heston held a ""big rally"".  Maybe just a coincidence, or maybe Moore knew that if he asked Heston about a ""pro gun rally"" in Michigan, Heston would have told him that he never held a ""pro gun rally"", making Moore look like a fool.  Tell me Moore doesn't have an agenda throughout this film.  Some of you people who soak up all of Moore's propaganda unquestioningly should do some homework before you praise his film any more.";Just a clarification...
182;241.0;3.0;10.0;"These names will always be a wake-up call for the Americans - Dyland Klebold and Eric Harris.\nDyland and Eric are both students in the Columbine High School and on April the 20th, 1999, these two best friends decided to unleash the deadliest school shooting in the history of the United States. These two cronies mercilessly murdering 12 classmates indiscriminately and a teacher, before ending their lives together. What went wrong with these two seemingly normal high school kids?\nIn Michael Moore's Oscar winning best documentary, Bowling for Columbine,the director delved into the reasons behind the school shooting. Other facets the film explored are other prominent problems of the United States, such as America's obsession with guns, the increasing fear in US residents, and the many faults of the US government, mainly of the Bush entrepreneurs. Many might deem that Moore did a spectacular job in presenting the truth while supporting his logic with persuading evidence and facts. However, I believe in exactly the opposite.\nBowling for Columbine"" is not a documentary, it is absolute fiction. After viewing the film, I believe Moore purposely deceives and misleads his audience by supporting his view with biased and slanted deceptions to persuade and he deliberately hid the other point of views of the situations from the viewers.\nThroughout the film, speeches, video clips, interviews and excerpts from TV programCOPS"" are shown. They may be strong and well-built proofs, but they can be edited and revised in order to support Moore.\nFor example, in order to back up his argument about African Americans are predominantly troublemakers and lawbreakers, Moore uses about 10 or more passages from COPS showing black people getting chased, hand-cuffed and arrested. As far as I know, there are also white criminals in the States too. This is an example of which Moore surreptitiously alters his information to cajole the viewers into his calculated trap.\nThe evidences that Moore collected was manipulated by him and therefore only supports one side of the arguments V his own.\nAccording to an online dictionary, dictionary.com, the definition of a documentary ispresenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.\nBy this definition,Bowling for Columbine,should not be viewed as a documentary, but as pure entertainment.\nMoore also suggested in his film, that the media, by exaggerating crimes and murders, were climaxing the fear in the hearts of American citizens. However, with fortified information and manipulated editing, it is his so-called documentary,Bowling for Columbine,that is creating fear and doubt in the hearts of the viewers.";manipulated truth

218;245.0;4.0;10.0;"Michael Moore's latest is engaging cinema, to say the least. His sarcastic, ultra-liberal approach to ""the awful truths"" of America have never been so entertaining. It's a cross between Candid Camera and 60 Minutes.\nThis time, he confronts the gun-culture of America. He highlights the fact that Charleton Heston and his merry band of pro-gun extremists held a rally near Columbine shortly after the tragedy there. Then, he and his ilk held ANOTHER gun-rally shortly after another child/gun tragedy in Flint, MI where a 6-year old child shot and killed a 6-year old classmate (Heston claims in the final interview of the film that he didn't know this had just happened when he appeared in Flint). Heston really shines when he claims that the reason for all of the violence in America is due to ""mixed ethnicity"". This statement is almost as jaw-dropping as Bob Eubanks' anti-semetic joke in Moore's debut, ""Roger & Me"", unless of course, you are a bigot.\nAlso interviewed, and similarly pathetic, is James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols and friend of Timothy McVeigh, both convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing. James, of course, is pro-gun, but doesn't believe the right to bear arms includes nuclear weapons (""There are a lot of nuts out there,"" he claims, to the howling delight of the audience).\nMarilyn Manson pops up also, commenting on how he was also blamed for Columbine because the idiots that killed at Columbine listened to his music.\nAnother highlight is when Michael invites two Columbine survivors to join him at the K-mart headquarters in Troy, MI, to ""return the bullets"" that are still embedded in their flesh from the Columbine attack (reportedly purchased from the local K-mart). This stunt results in K-mart's announcement that they will be pulling ammunition off of their shelves, to Moore's own astonishment.\nAlthough there is a lot of serious business in the movie, it is packaged with enough laugh-out-loud footage to make it bearable, even entertaining, even in light of the constant barrage of violence played out on nightly newscasts.\nThe only major downside is Moore's lack of thoroughness in certain areas. For instance, he claims Canada has as many guns as we do in America, and therefore the death-by-gun rate should be the same (of course Canada has FAR fewer gun-related deaths than the U.S.). However, Canada bans handgun ownership. This is not pointed out.\nAlso, he tries to blame Michigan's ""Welfare to Work"" program for the classroom shooting of the 6-year old child, his claim being that because the mother of the shooter had to work far from home (via bussing), she had to leave her children in the care of her brother, who owned the gun that the child found and brought to school. This is a stretch, as when he also blames General Motors for this tragedy, inferring that it was because GM ruined Flint, MI that this tragedy occured. These tangents, although interesting, often seem somewhat scattershot.\nThere are other flaws as well, and many will depend on your viewpoint, but no matter what you think about Michael Moore or gun control, this movie is funny, thought-provoking and will stick with you awhile.";Flawed but Hilarious
221;246.0;5.0;10.0;"Well, as far as all the five star ratings go, I don't think that I can add too much to what's already been said.  Moore raises more questions than he provides answers to, which was his point.  Why DON'T they have the kind of homicide rate in Canada that we do, when there are seven million guns in ten million homes up there?\nIf you draw you own conclusions though, you can see his point.  It totally IS the media.  I don't mean video games, Hollywood bloodbaths, and Marilyn Manson (which Moore points out are just as frequently devoured in Canada and elsewhere).  I'm talking about the NEWS.  Government propaganda and how the news media puts a spin on it.  I think that we as human beings can differentiate between a violent video game and real violence.  It's called human intelligence.  But when all we hear on the news is tragedy after tragedy after tradgedy, we come to believe our neighborhoods and towns are more dangerous than they really are.  That breeds fear, which breeds violence, which breeds more fear, and the vicious cycle keeps going on and on.  THIS is Moore's theme not just in the Canada section, but throughout the film.\nHere's another interesting point.  Michael points out that the U.S. is capitalist in the extreme.  I used to be undecided on nationalized health care, but now I support it.  I originally bought in to Jesse Ventura's argument against nationalized health care, which is that when you only get one provider, you get corruption.  However, I've changed my mind on that.  Nationalized health care works in every other 1st-world, freeworld country: the UK, Canada, Spain, France, Germany... We're essentially a society that says, ""If you can bust through college and work your way into the white-collar sector and land a job with a Fortune 500 corporation, THEN you've earned the right to not have to worry about health care.""\nMoore suggests, and I agree, that it's that kind of Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest mentality about our country that causes people to snap and commit carnage.\nOutstanding work.  Every American, heck every human, needs to view this one.\nPS Though I disagree with Jesse Ventura on healthcare, he is another one of my social heroes, after reading his book ""Do I Stand Alone?""

348;253.0;5.0;10.0;America a country without a true left or even a political centre has produced one of the great populists of modern times in Michael Moore. In this documentary he investigates the reasons behind the high incidence of gun deaths by young males. He focuses on two incidents, the killings at Columbine High School and another incident in which a young boy uses his fathers gun to murder.\nMoore finds that the reasons for killing are not related to guns. Canada being a country which has a large rural sector has a huge rate of gun ownership but hardly any murders at all. What is the difference? The according to Moore is that Canada is a much more harmonious and peaceful society. He goes to a Canadian city and searches for the slum area but can only find well maintained comfortable public housing. He speaks to Canadians and finds that there is less fear, less conflict and less lunacy. America by contrast is not only a country with guns, it is a country in which people are scared and always on edge. The deaths and murders stem from this conflict which stems from America being a nation in which there is little investment in public infrastructure and there are huge pockets of poverty.\nMoore however presents this message subtlety allowing it to come out of a series of interviews and stunts. He talks to the friends of the gunmen who were responsible for the murders at Columbine. He interviews a relative of Timothy McVeigh. Those interviewed are people who are seriously weird and the fact that they have open access to gun ownership is mind boggling. He travels to Canada speaks to law enforcement officers there about issues and looks at Canadian cities. He looks at the background of the tragic young boy and what the American welfare system required of the mother.\nYet for a film dealing with such a serious subject one cannot stop laughing at the brilliance in which Moore portrays the lunacy of some aspects of American society. His genius is that he can make some young gun victims look like (and they probably felt) heroes in confronting the store who sold the ammuntion which destroyed their bodies and making them withdraw it from sale. He can also turn a very old and pathetic Charlton Heston into an embodiment of evil indifference.\nThey used to say that the Truimph of the Will was the greatest propoganda films of all time. This is ahead of that by a country mile.;Best Documentary of All Time
351;254.0;1.0;10.0;All of the negative publicity on firearms is misguided. We as a society has lost sight of the criminal himself, and focus now on the tool he uses. Firearms are not to blame. Liberals are. Their nit-picking and stupidity have eroded this county out from under itself. Gun owners should not be blamed or punished for the wronful acts of few. And lets not forget why Columbine happened.\nBecause two kids were being tormented so badly, they needed to strike back. Harsh? A little. Deserved? Definetly!;Misguided
373;255.0;5.0;10.0;"I'll be honest. I heard of 'Bowling for Columbine' before the Oscars, but never paid much notion. Until I heard Moore's Oscar speech on the radio. I was amazed that anyone would dare to speak out so sharply against the Bush administration on such an event.\nSadly, though, the movie was unavailable to me for a long time... Amazon's English counterpart DOES have it for sale. (Region 2).\nThe movie is built around the shootout at the Columbine high school, where two teenagers opened fire on their fellow students. Moore wonders what possessed these two, and makes it his mission to find out why the US shows such a ridiculously high number of murders when compared to other nations such as Canada, the UK, Germany, etc.\nHe interviews various people, ranging from NRA's chief spokes goblin Charlton Heston, relatives of the kids who got killed, victims of the Columbine shootout, and bad-boy rocker Marilyn Manson (Who is named as one source of violence in kids).\nAs the documentary proceeds, Moore weeds out a few of the often-named arguments of why anyone would go postal. Violent movies are also watched in other countries, Marilyn Manson is also listened to in other countries, Canadians own more guns-per-capita than the US, and not just the US has a violent history.\nThe underlying conclusion as the movie proceeds seems to be that Americans are kept in control by fear; time after time, the US Government uses the media to strike fear into it's subject's hearts. This (according to the movie) leads to the 'Shoot first, ask questions later' mentality that could in turn explain why the number of killings in the US is as high as it is.\nA very striking moment (in my opinion) is when Moore takes two victims to K-mart's HQ, and kindly asks them to stop selling ammo for handguns. Initially, they seem to have hit a brick wall, but when they return the day after (with more press in their tracks than Michael Jackson usually gets), a statement is made that K-mart indeed will stop selling said ammo.\nMoore raises some very valid points, often combined with a great touch of humour, and we can only hope that enough people will go and watch this movie. If Moore succeeds in just making ONE person reconsider taking up their gun and using it to cause death and mayhem, THAT'S when the movie REALLY proved successful.";Clever 'movie', highly worth the watch.
380;256.0;4.0;10.0;"I've just read a few reviews on the previous pages and I must say that some people really don't apply any thought or have any ability to extract a memory of a given film. However, I do agree with one thing that the naysayers are saying... BFC is not a documentary and never should have been entered into this catagory. It is wholly a single-sided perspective that pointedly asks the question ""Why is it that America has the highest gun-related deaths on earth?"" A interesting question and it is facinating to see Moore struggle to attain any sort of coherent answer to such a morbid inquiry. A lot of his ""murder by numbers"" are suspect (where did he get those death-toll numbers?). However, his ""gun owned ratio"" is quite exact with Canada having more guns per person than America and yet the number of deaths related to that ownership percentage is far exceeded in America (and you don't need to be a statistician to figure that one out - an averaging of newpaper headlines between both national boarders is revealing enough even for the most simple-minded).\nThe way that Moore trudges on bravely to find his answer is most of the entertainment found within this film, and his conclusion that FEAR is the driving motivation behind the excessive gun-related death is an interesting hypothesis that perhaps bears further investigation (and I suspect that that simple explaination is either letter perfect or not far off the mark).\nThis was an entertaining film that threw out apparently random statistics in order to pigeon-hole and stereotype militia (although they are a laughable and often simple people) and villify the aging Charlton by re-editing and splicing sound-bytes so that the common person will make unfounded and highly illogical connections between his speeches as the head of the NRA, the time that they took place, where they took place, and the content that they spoke to and of.\nIf nothing else, it's fun to see people mis-interpret the message that Moore is trying to say which is, at it's most simple... guns aren't bad, it's the society's perpetuation of misunderstanding, stereotyping, and ability to lay blame that creates these complex problems. Oh the humanity!";Wow, some people really don't get this movie!!!

I don't care.  This was an entertaining movie.  I don't go to the movies to learn 'facts' I go to be entertained, and that's what this movie does.  Don't confuse me with 'truth' vs. 'error'.

393;258.0;2.0;10.0;"An otherwise excellent Academy Awards show was marred when the Academy gave an Oscar to Michael Moore for this political polemic about violence in America.  The attendees roundly booed Moore's acceptance remarks, and Steve Martin joked about putting Moore in the trunk of his limousine. After the Award ceremony we've seen David Horowitz on CNN refer to Michael as an ""ultra-left wing, anti-American Leninist.""  On Jay Leno we saw James Woods refer to Michael's acceptance remarks as ""Chicken(bleep)!""  So between those two and the Academy we have a pretty wide range of reactions to Michael and his movie!\nHe begins with Columbine and demonstrates that everyone looks at that tragedy and sees their favorite evils, whatever they are.  A series of commentators on TV enumerate their respective favorite enemies:  Satan; Bill Clinton; Marilyn Manson; violent video games; violence on television; violence in the news; violent gangsta rap; and on and on. It makes the point that the public reaction to the massacre was bewilderment, confusion, and BIG differences of opinion about what could cause such despicable brutality by a couple of seemingly typical teenagers. Michael makes the case that, since the last thing these boys did before they opened fire was to go bowling, why not blame bowling for the incident; hence, the name of this movie.\nMoore conducts many of his patented self-promoting, sanctimonious interviews including James Nichols, unindicted co-conspirator in the Oklahoma City bombing and a member of the Michigan Militia (It's pretty funny); Marilyn Manson (It's pretty thoughtful, and a little touching); and Charlton Heston (It's so annoying, you wonder why Heston didn't pull out his long musket and order Michael off his property!  Probably would have, had he not been in the early stages of Alzheimer's, as we learned later.)\nHe finds some easy laughs in a bank in the Midwest that was offering a free rifle to anyone opening a new account.  He perhaps does some good by interviewing folks at Kmart about their sale of bullets.  I understand they took them off their shelves after Michael's interview.\nOne of the most objectionable scenes in the movie is footage of the second airplane flying into the World Trade Center to a recording of Louis Armstrong singing ""What a Wonderful World."" It's a mystery what argument is being made here, or what purpose is trying to be served.  For me it was horrifying and tasteless---perhaps more horrifying than when I saw it on live TV on 9/11!\nAnother low point is an ambush interview with Dick Clark, in which Michael is evidently blaming HIM for a tragic Michigan school shooting.  It struck me as utterly unfair and dishonest, and NO ONE will believe that accusation.\nThis film attacks so many subjects so broadly that it has all the subtlety of one of those ""anti-personnel"" missiles that explode 100 feet in the air and spew shrapnel all over an area the size of two football fields, killing everyone indiscriminately.  Military hypocrisy; media focus on violent crime; the gun industry; the NRA; the KKK; U.S. foreign policy inconsistencies; ALL the usual suspects. And nowhere is there any real insight into any of these ""problems,"" and certainly no solutions.\nHe mentions that on the day of the Columbine shootings the U.S. dropped more bombs on Kosovo than on any other single day.  So what are we to make of THAT coincidence?  Michael doesn't say, but seems to imply some ominous, undefined connection.\nThis movie shows us a lot of Michael's anger but very little insight.  Like his book ""Stupid White Men,"" it comes across as self-promotion masquerading as investigative, crusading journalism in this movie, and as political humor in the case of the book. There is more and better humor in the movie than the book, but a few chuckles do not redeem either work, for me.\nThe movie is at times thought provoking, at other times mindless.  Sometimes invigorating, at other times infuriating. Always confrontational, NEVER conciliatory. The hope of many media reviewers has been that the movie will stimulate more discussion of the causes for excessive violence in America.  If that was the goal I think it has failed.  Conservatives see the movie as despicable anti-American propaganda, while liberals see it as gospel (perhaps admitting to a little artistic overemphasis, at worst.)  So, I think the effect of the movie is DIVISIVE in the extreme. And that makes it a very bad movie in my book---notwithstanding the Academy Award for best documentary feature of 2001. I've read that in the last few years violent crime in the U.S. is DOWN 20%, while media reporting of crime is UP 600%.  This ""documentary"" goes a long way to INCREASE that kind of imbalance, and of course that's one of the things Michael skewers as a cause of the anxiety that underlies violence.\nSo--- is Michael a genius---or an ultra-liberal, anti-American Leninist?  You'll have to decide for yourself.  Some liberals have said that Michael Moore is the Rush Limbaugh of the left.  If so, maybe some enterprising, struggling conservative mediocrity will follow Al Francken's example and make his fame and fortune with a book called ""Michael Moore is a Big, Fat Idiot!""  Worked pretty well for Al!";Genius---or Looney Liberal Leninist?
434;259.0;5.0;10.0;"It's probably Moore's best work, and an interesting film on the reasons for disproportionate gun violence in the United States.\nFor those who don't know, Moore is probably best known for ""ambushing"" the subjects of his interviews by asking them extremely uncomfortable questions that they probably weren't expecting him to ask. I'm not overly fond of the technique, but it has produced some interesting results.\nThough a gun owner, I'm not by any stretch a gun-nut.  However, I really don't think the film is as anti-gun as it is often made out to be. Moore himself has a lifetime membership in the NRA and was a skilled shooter in his youth. On the other hand, there's no denying that he purposely picks some kooks to make the gun people look bad. On the other hand, they are undeniably part of the ""from my cold, dead hand"" crowd.\nOn the whole, the movie's underlying goal is not to lambast gun ownership itself. Rather, Moore does a decent job of framing the real question: why does the US, which actually doesn't have disproportionate per capita gun ownerhsip compare to many other industrialized countries (such as Canada), have such disproportionate gun violence? He doesn't come down firmly on the side of any particular answer, but he does identify and explore a number of potential reasons. Which, I guess, means that if you aren't interested in the question or don't think there is a problem, it's not a film for you.\nThere are moments when Moore goes a bit too far with the technique described above, but there are others when he uses it quite effectively. Also, the big ending is an interview with Charleton Heston, which I found interesting, but which I'm not sure actually fits with the seeming overall purpose of the film to ask questions and explore answers. I'm still undecided about that part of it.\nFinally, the overall thesis (in my opinion at least) of Bowling For Columbine is that the United States lives in (and perpetuates its own) fear.  Having travelled to many other countries, I find it hard to argue with that thesis, since I too have observed that unfortunate phenomenon about my country.";Bowling for Columbine is worth seeing
466;260.0;4.0;10.0;"Michael Moore's latest film ""Bowling for Columbine"" is an in your face expose on the insanity of gun violence plaguing the US. It uses Moore's cutting edge humor to get the point across well:  our gun laws or lack thereof are insane.  The film's title comes from the fact that the Columbine shooters went bowling right before their rampage.  And this film includes actual surveillance video of the rampage inside the school.  Another bowling connection is that militias use bowling pins for target practice.\nMichael interviews some Michigan Militia in action and find they are just normal people...with some abnormal hobbies.  Then he interviews the brother of Terry Nichols (the Oklahoma City conspirator) and we see a true lunatic in action; among other things he takes his loaded .45 from under his pillow and puts it to his own head...even Michael gets nervous.  Brother Nichols shows his worldliness when Michael asks about Ghandi.  ""I'm not familiar with that.""\nHe then interviews a Littleton defense worker about Columbine and tries to draw the connection between the world's biggest arms manufacturer and the school shootings.  The worker says ""well we don't bomb someone just cause we don't like them"", and the film cuts to the whole long list of US backed coups most progressives are familiar with.  This makes the point in a flawed way, as we didn't ""bomb"" some of the countries we overthrew, so it comes off as a bit preachy and propagandistic.\nWe then see that most countries in Europe have annual gun death rates of under 100, while US average is over 11,000.  Then we're in Canada, a very low crime gun culture where people leave their doors open...literally!\nMichael interviews Charlton Heston and challenges him on his NRA exploits.  This causes Heston to walk away, but HEY, he did at least do an interview...what Dick Clark does in this film is Despicable.\nWe end with Michael bringing 2 Columbine victims to Kmart to get them to stop selling bullets.  A small victory in an ocean of gun insanity.\nEvery American should see this film and then write your Congressman if you've had enough of gun violence in the country.";Very Good film, THE definitive film on US gun insanity
0;261.0;4.0;10.0;so michael moore's movie is well made, entertaining ... and for a documentary, i think that says a lot...i think he set out to try and answer why the US has so many gun slayings, with a presumption that it's due to our obsession with guns. he spends the first 30 minutes making dumb gun owners look really dumb, but that's no big feat. I think the main crux of the movie happens when he goes to Canada and discovers that they've got just as big (infatuation) for guns as america does, with a fraction of the crime. Canada had something like 500 gun slayings last year, whereas the ol' US had over 11,000. So he then had to reevaluate what was behind the bloodthirst here in the states. The answer he comes to, i feel was dead on. The media and an atmosphere of terror and fear perpetuated by the media, which seemed to be a problem only within the US.\nOnce he carries the audience to that point, the target of the movie should have changed. Instead of continuing to make gun owners look bad, i feel he should have started poking at the media...and he starts to with an interview of the producer of the Cops TV show and an embarrassing scene with a reporter on the scene of the youngest school slaying. But the climax of the movie returns to the original focus and attacks guns. Two scenes, trying to get bullets removed from the shelves of Kmart and another embarrassing interview with an enthused gun advocate, this time the king of the mountain, the president of the NRA, Charlton Heston himself. Sure, the bullets used in Columbine were from Kmart and the NRA used atrocious judgment in showing up in Columbine within days of the shooting for a gun rally. But Michael Moore has already shown us that these things are not at the crux of our murder rate, at least, not directly responsible....So why still attack them?\nIn the end, i felt like this was a propaganda movie. and regardless of the cause, propaganda with its slanting facts, playing the shell game, or distracting viewers is still wrong. the ends don't justify the means. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to everyone, but i felt in the end that Michael Moore's motives got a little muddy.;Motives got a little muddy
73;262.0;2.0;9.0;"Seriously... people... the purpose of a documentary is to display the facts surrounding a certain period in history or an event or theory.  Some would say to DOCUMENT the event, as a solid and complete explanation of the happenings.  This is NOT a documentary.  Michael Moore does a very good job putting some information together pertaining to gun control/violence in America, however, to take all of the information as the hard truth is just ignorant.\n\nMoore does a VERY good job of editing interviews, voiceovers, thoughts and images to get the effect he wants on his viewers.  Example: Moore is doing a voice over about handguns and how they kill X number of children each year.  He then cuts to a picture of Lockheed-Martin's entry sign with the caption ""Largest weapons manufacturer in America"" or something to that effect.  If I didn't know any better I would think that this specific Lockheed made firearms... not rockets to send TV satallites into orbit!\n\nHis interview style rubs me the wrong way as he obviously shows no respect for anyone's opinion but his own (very documentarian of him).  And his misguided non-attempt to figure out why we have so many gun deaths amounts to him sitting there and saying, ""It might be number of guns, but it's not.  It might be the government, but it's not...""  And for those who think his final answer is the media... his own movie states that over a period when homicide rates were falling, media coverage of murder increased by 600%, who didn't murder rates likewise increase?\n\nI respect the movie for being thought provoking and creating intellectual conversation between people, but calling this a documentary is insulting.  I won't go so far as to call this propaganda, but do not watch this movie unless you are either willing to do research on your own, or follow Moore's truth blindly.";NOT a documentary
84;263.0;2.0;9.0;"Nobody questions the fact that Michael Moore is a brilliant and talented filmmaker. He's great at using clever imagery and catchy phrases to ambush his audience emotionally, making his slanted leftist point all the more realistic to the uninformed.\n\nHowever anyone with even a modest understanding of history, politics and economics can only be confused by his blatant contradictions and outright falsehoods. Make no mistake, Michael Moore is a man with an agenda.\n\nThis movie is absolutely riddled with distortions, half-truths, and outright lies. Take for example the whole ""gun in the bank"" scene, where he wants you to believe he was given a gun just for opening a bank account. What Moore doesn't tell you is that it was a CD, requiring a minimun 2,000 dollar deposit to open. He also doesn't tell you that the bank never really just hands the guns to the customers over the counter. There is no possible way  any American bank can hand you a gun for opening any account. He had to go to an independant gun dealer in the area and fill out the appropriate government paperwork (and pay for it, it's not too cheap), wait for the background check, and pick up the rifle awhile later from the same gun dealer. The bank scene is staged to make it appear as if he just opened an account and was immediately handed a deadly weapon. Besides, why would anyone who was intent on getting a gun possibly for malicious purposes put down a 2,000 dollar deposit just to get a $200 single shot hunting rifle or shotgun?\n\nMichael Moore, of course, leaves it up to his legions of easily duped burger flipping young followers to find this out on their own.\n\nAs the movie drags on we are treated to example after exhausting example of Moore's tired leftist logic and phony criticisms of ""American Gun Culture""...*dun dun dunnnnnn*! Instead of a careful and even handed view of the more than 90 million American gun owners (yes 90 million, almost 1/3 of the American population owns at least 1 firearm), we are treated to some backwoods moron militiaman as our supposed textbook example of an armed American.\n\nAnyone with any unbiased sense of logic and a mediocre understanding of gun statistics at this point has to be asking themselves why would Mr. Moore pick someone like this to make an example of. Remember folks, 290 million total US population, 90 million (and that's just the one's we know about...) gun ownners. Are we to believe that 90 million people in the US are probably just like the militia moron portrayed, or worse??\n\nAlso ask yourself, if there are at least 90 million people in America that own at least one gun, and there are 30-40 thousand firearms related deaths per year in this country, that means your chances of being shot to death in this country are roughly 1 in 8 to 9 thousand.\n\nWhy is the self styled ""working class hero"" and college dropout trying so hard to make us all afraid of something that has killed far fewer people than cars, swimming pools, and high fat diets?\n\nI could go on all day about the many, many slanted views and outrageous claims put forth is this piece of propoganda, but there isn't enough time or space to do so. If anyone needs any further proof that Moore is a liar and a fraud, Google is your friend. The collective resources of the internet are more than enough to debunk 95% of the dreck that spews from Moore's gratuitous piehole.\n\nFurthermore, take heed kids. Socialism has been tried all over the world and failed everywhere it's been implemented. If Canada and Europe are so great, why can't they come anywhere near to matching the productivity rates, industriousness, and wealth building power of America and it's free market system? There's probably nothing that Moore is more wrong on than economics. That may be worth keeping in mind when reading his daily website blurbs and more recent books.

113;266.0;5.0;9.0;Funny -- the people who seem to think this movie was about gun control must not have even seen it. Making the point that Canada has as many guns as we do, Michael Moore concedes that they do not have the crime level that we do. The reason we do, he points out, is the focus this country has on power, dominance, and violence -- through our media, our methods of crime control, and our interactions with the world. None of it is effective, and all of it creates more harm than it heals. It is the American focus on the power of violence that is at the roots of our dilemma -- that, and a history of power and control and manipulation of our children that Moore is either not aware of or does not go into. That's okay. His body of work involves more investigative reporting than I have seen in my lifetime. It was the mainstream media that immediately began talking about gun control in the wake of Columbine, smacking of the Hegelian dialectic. No mass media outlet started talking about controlling their own violent imagery. Let me quickly state that Michael Moore is not advocating censorship -- for an investigative journalist, that would be foolish. What he is advocating is responsible journalism -- something that seems to have gone the way of the dinosaur -- until one considers Jon Stewart. Maybe they should get together and create their own news channel. It would be one place you could get the truth and be able to make informed decisions, instead of wanting to take a shower after each barrage of mass manipulation.;Investigative journalism at its finest

201;270.0;5.0;9.0;"I expected this movie to be heavy in opinion but with a bit of Moore's usual fun.  I was greatly impressed that this movie did not spoon-feed answers.  It masterfully raised the serious questions about why the gun-violence in America is so great when in other nations, even those with lots of guns, it isn't.\nI find people that are criticizing this movie largely seem to fall into the ""America ia great"" and if you point out our problems you must be anti-American.  I strongly disagree with this point and believe if we want to remain great, we need to ask ourselves the tough questions.  And this movie certainly does that.\nI've found in other countries I've lived, it is common on nightly shows and media to look at national issues, discuss them intelligently with voices from ALL sides of the issue, and look at how other nations deal with the problem.  Sadly, that type of debate is very difficult to find in this country.  The media either keeps everything watered-down and middle-of-the-road, frequently only allows ""paid lobbyists"" to talk or you have a bunch of people screaming trying to ""score points"".\nBuy this movie, share it with your friends and family, and talk about how we can fix this problem that is killing our children and our future.";Don't be afraid to THINK

Moore's end product does not justify the means. Eventhough Moore doesn't use a gun to kill ,he's the very essence of the ""drive-by media"".Why didn't he do a film on pukeheads who recklessly abuse their right to own a gun?-Answer-because that would give honest people the validation to bear arms. The people he points to ,in the film, who have done the shootings,are kids. After years of watching violent images,via videogames,and no parental control led them to that destructive behavior. Not the K-Mart availableness of the rifles and the bullets. The eschatological preachers of the elusive Doomsday,like David Karesch,do have a right to gun-ownership. But not for Holy War,against the American government and Pagan socialists alike. Now,Tim McVeigh's senseless bombing ,had more to do with his anti-social delusions ,rather than his true feelings about legal restrictions on unlimited gun-ownership.(If it wasn't for the song ,""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", John Lennon may not have been shot by the maniacal subliminal Beatle listener,Mark David Chapman.) Charlton Heston supports ownership of hunting rifles,for sport and protection. The surprise Moore attack on Heston,was ridiculous. Like comparing apples to oranges. Moore shows himself as an opportunist,and not a gentleman. Dick Clark owns some music restaurant chain,where a black woman was directed to work at one. How is he to know,about her family members possessing guns or not?She broke the law,and Clark can not be held responsible for her domestic negligence. The careless woman's family promoted an un-healthy atmosphere for their dear children. Moore's subreptitious inferences are highly entertaining,but divert from the root cause of the lethal gun shootings,in America.";Confusing the Argument on need for more American Gun-Control.
243;272.0;2.0;9.0;I didn't fully understand this film, perhaps you really have to be American to get it.  Michael Moore's point seems to be that Americans are more violent than other people, I have no idea whether this is ture or not.  Does he want to ban guns? I couldn't quite  make out exactly what he wanted.  He is very fond of following people around with a camera and trying to interview them, but i understand he doesn't much care for it when others do the same to him.  I heard he got someone thrown in jail for pestering him in a similar manner?  Is this true?  I would love to know.  He succeeded in irritating Charlton Heston, i rather hoped Mr. Heston might take a swing at him, but instead he just walked away, somewhat to my dissapointment.  He seems to approve of Canada, where apparently it's so safe people don't even lock their doors.  this, if true, is very dissapointing.  I had the impression that Canada was a sinister, dangerous country full of vampires, werewolves, deomns, ghosts, ghouls, and entrances to Hell.  This is because I spend too much time reading the novels of Tanya Huff, who has succeeded in making Canada a very exciting place, to me anyway.  Michael moore has really dissillusioned me.  Would gun control make America less violent?  I live in a country where it is practically impossible to own a gun, most people never even see a real gun, yet that doesn't stop nutters from getting hold of them every so often and going on the rampage.  I don't know what the answer is.  I'm not even sure what the question is.;Bowling baffled me
245;273.0;2.0;9.0;The scene that did it for me in Michael Moore's  well done film  involved an interview with a police officer about someone who dressed a dog up as a hunter and was accidentally shot. Funny? Yes. Demeaning? Yes again.\n Moore makes numerous valid points throughout his film. But, too often, for my taste, he does it by ridiculing someone. He does it politely, but not without meanness.  And that is why I was uncomfortable with watching the film. And that is why I am rating this film low.;Meanspirited
246;274.0;5.0;9.0;This is a powerful documentary which looks into the unsusually large number of gun deaths in the United States.  It had me in tears.  To see the extent to which fear grips the minds of Americans--fear of terrorists, fear of minorities, fear of the government, fear of being unpopular--the list goes on and on.  Moore makes the point that this fear is what drives the violence in America.  We're constantly bombarded with messages of fear from the media and the government.  For a comparison, look at Canada.  There are a large number of guns in Canada, but the gun violence rate is nowhere near the gun violence rate of America.  Why is this?\nSome may say that there is a lot of gun violence in America because we have a violent history.  Well, that theory doesn't hold any water.  Germany and Japan have had a very violent history (think of the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking), but the rate of gun violence in those countries is low compared with America's rate.  Also you can't say it's violent movies or games.  They watch and play those in other countries too.\nIt's about time someone took on the NRA.  Perhaps the saddest scene is the last one in which Charlton Heston struggles to defend his views on gun ownership.  He just sticks his foot in his mouth and had to run away.  I really applaud Moore for his ability to chase down and confront these gun nuts.  You never know when they might snap and take a shot at him.  Let's use some common sense when dealing with this issue.  You really have to see this movie and think about this issue seriously.;Thought Provoking
249;275.0;5.0;9.0;"Bowling for Columbine is an excellent documentary by Michael Moore that discusses the issue of gun control.  Many people might not like Moore for his beliefs or the way he goes about getting his ideas to the public, me included, but there is something very thought provoking here.  Moore asks repeatedly,""Why are more Americans killing each other?""  He interviews countless numbers of people showing both sides of the spectrum; those for guns and those against.  This documentary does deal with a very serious subject, but Moore is able to inject humor into with his dry wit using certain camera angles and impeccable timing.  One of the most effective parts of the movie is Moore's interview with Charlton Heston, who gets caught up in his own web of excuses.  It is startling to see that Heston has no response, or not a good one, for most of Moore's questions.\n  The Bowling for Columbine DVD is very good.  It includes numerous extras some of which are very good.  There are several interviews with Moore on different talk shows as well as an interview about Moore's controversial acceptance speech at the Oscars.  It also includes several featurettes, the theatrical trailer, and a photo gallery among many more extras.  While not everyone will agree with Michael Moore, he does know how to provoke people into thinking about subjects that they would rather not.

Desperate to find anything ""different"", reviewers gave ""Bowling For Columbine"" far more credit than it deserves.\nTo call ""Bowling For Columbine"" a documentary is laughable.  In a genuine documentary, one of two approaches is taken.  The author will either start with a hypothesis and attempt to prove/disprove it through investigative journalism, or he'll investigate a topic in an attempt to provide some insight.  Moore does neither.\nInstead, Michael Moore pollutes the screen with his unpleasant form, bouncing from scene to scene making no points in particular.  Hijacking an inevitably controversial topic, gun control, Moore gives his audience a paltry excuse at objectivity by interviewing people on both sides of the issue.\nMoore follows no path of reason, nor does he make a persuasive case for his  obvious anti-gun bias.  Just as the audience might start to doze off, Moore becomes inflammatory, badgering K-Mart into policy change and staging an infantile display of emotional drivel and character assassination directed at an overly polite Charlton Heston.\n""Bowling For Columbine"" at long last grinds to an abrupt much-awaited conclusion, cheating this viewer out of an opportunity to demand a refund before the end of show.";Dull, devoid of insight, lacking flow

283;278.0;5.0;9.0;I am positive that this is not a perfect movie.  I cringe watching it and some of the logic is a little flawed.  About ten minutes in we are barraged with much violence...and then we are told that what  the media is showing us is leading us to paranoia.  However, there is also no doubt that this is made by one of the most brilliantly subsersive people on the planet.  Michael Moore is manipulative and all over the map.  I agree that the movie seems to lack a central focus...but the ideas are beyond thought provoking.\nYou are not going to watch this movie passively.  You will have an opinion about it.  I like movies that challenge me.  I like movies that risk.  I even like movies that are so opinionated that the risk contradicting themselves.  I loved this movie.  There were times I was angry about it(I think Moore sometimes makes the wrong person look bad...in his constant desire to speak to the big man it is obvious that he only embarrases the poor middle man.  It would be like having an issue with Moore himself and only speaking to his interns...but I guess ultimately Moore might show up) but there were as many times that I was set afloat by powerful ideaas.  It is not just about gun control but about the country we live in.  A country that gives its country a right to bear arms....and to speak their mind about the glitch in that right.

321;279.0;1.0;9.0;I am a huge fan of documentaries, I have watched hundreds and bought the ones that told there stories with the most skill and passion. A Documentary is a subject put on film to tell a true story, to educate the viewer and to bring the subject to light. That is Why when you watch one you never see the person that is making the film, because that person cares about the subject they are telling and not about making themselves look good. This is not the case for Mike Moore, his name is over the title as if this is a action movie and he is Arnold or Sly there is a picture of him on the cover as if he is the subject and that is pretty much the case. If you go to any store and buy 100 or more documentaries including both of his. His will be the only ones with the film maker on the cover. That's because the other film makers are promoting the subject matter and not themselves. if you watched them all you would see that on all the others you never see the film maker, butt with Moore's film that's almost all you see. The mans ego gets in the way of the story he is trying to tell. Which tells me that like always in Mike Moore's case promoting him self is more important to him then the subject at hand and that is not a documentary. A extremely poor film.;This documentary is more self promotion than anything else.

The logic presented to the viewer in this film is about as insightful as a fortune cookie from your local Chinese take-out resturaunt.\nMoore seems more concerned about the gun lobby than examining the question of why these teens decided to turn their high school into a live-action video game. The question should not be how did they get the guns, but WHY did they use them? Why did they find human life so cheap?

40;283.0;3.0;8.0;Gun control is a hot issue in America, and will be for a long time. There is no question that there is a problem with gun violence, and Mr. Moore tackles this issue head on in Bowling.\n\nDoes he do it successfully? I don't think so. There are simply too many loose ends and lazy connections that need to be resolved.\n\nFor example, in his expose of the the Columbine shootings. He targets Lockheed Martin the major corporation that makes arms for the military (because having military technology is conducive to teeage violence). He interviews Marylin Manson on the social reasons of teenage rage and why they kill (because they feel unnaccepted). He then goes on to take on Kmart for selling bullets (because bullets go into guns). He then takes a grand tour of socialist Canada where no one seems die from gun wounds (because capitalism seems to breed violence).\n\nSo in conclusion, we can safely say that teens tend to kill because we have alienated teens, living in a greedy capitalist society, with corporations that make military grade weapons and shop at Kmart. It really is a neat arguement if it works. The problem is, there is no real one cause and no real way of knowing why people go on shooting sprees.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Moore never quite addresses the question of personal responsibility and family supervision. Where are the PARENTS in this movie? Is it possible that a loving mother and father could have saved the day? Nah. Of course not, they are  not in the movie. However, it is possible that Marlyin Manson may have the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n\nOtherwise, this is a thoroughly engaging and entertaining movie.;Now This is Propoganda

371;285.0;5.0;9.0;Having seen this at the cinema twice, and being a proud owner of my own copy on DVD (I live in the UK, it's been out here for a few weeks) I can understand why this documentary won it's award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002.\nThe focus is primarily about gun ownership, fear culture, and some history of gun laws, in the USA. Columbine High School is used as one of the illustrative examples of how and why the current legislation is not a good thing.\nSome coverage is provided about the culture surrounding gun ownership, and the culture of fear that seems prevelant in american media over recent years. As a regular viewer of american news services (thank-you digital tv :-), I can attest to the accuracy of this coverage in comparison to that provided in europe. Michael Moore provides his own comparison - to media coverage of events in Canada. Also, some interesting insights from Marilyn Manson (who rose considerably in my estimation), which seemed especially relevant as we sat on the cusp of Gulf War 2.\nSomething which was clear to me from Moore's attempts to speak to someone senior in K-Mart, was that without making a fuss, and turning up without an attending media circus, no-one seemed particularly interested in listening to him and the students he was with. It seemed that only when revenue was potentially affected by bad press, was anyone prepared to take any form of action at all.\nThe closing interview with Charlton Heston, and indeed some of his actions as president of the NRA, leaves one wondering how people of this ilk can sleep at night. Perhaps it's the loaded weapon under the pillow that does it for them, which I find as disturbing as some of the other images presented liberally throughout the documentary.\nI speculate that there are those in the USA who will not take well to this. However, I felt that the documentary was well thought through, and presented a good case for attempting to remove guns from the population at large. It may also help a few people consider how some of us in europe view the USA.\nThere's a lot more I could say about this, but you really are better seeing this for yourself. There's plenty in there to make you laugh, but there's even more that you'll watch from behind your hands in disbelief. You can be laughing one minute, and very misty eyed the next.

Given that, however, there still is a lot of truth in there. The U.S. support of foreign dictators and U.S. installed governments is certainly something that nobody seems to want to address. It's also true that Moore's argument is discontinuous and never arrives at a true solution. But I give him a lot of credit for attempting to bring an enigma to the attention of Americans. Once again, the ""statistics"" of the number of gun deaths for various countries are misleading, but it does show that there are many many many more gun deaths in the States than there are in most industrialized countries. And although it doesn't provide a definite answer, it does ask the question of why things are like they way they are in America. In the end, I don't think this movie is about gun control anymore than it's actually about Columbine. It's about asking a tough question, and at least trying to find an answer. I find it odd that Moore's opponents spend more time talking down at the Left than they do trying to answer a legitimate question.";Misunderstood

I have no doubt in my mind that if Gore was now in office, and he sent the troops into Iraq using the same political and propaganda-like tactics the Bush administration is using, Moore would've called him out in front of millions, too.\nIn some ways I agree with Moore's critics when they accuse him of being a manipulator of the facts in order to further his own agenda. But here's the thing: Michael Moore is Michael Moore. Everyone knows of his past work. It is there like a bullet lodged in the throat.  Everyone knew he was going to cause a fuss at the Oscars. Everyone knew that ""Bolwing for Columbine"" would be slanted in a way that would [upset] ... about 60 percent of America. Moore's last movie, ""The Big One,"" felt a little forced in this way(I still loved it). It was just an extension of his stint on television, and never moved the emotions quite like ""Bowling for Columbine."" It's a great expose and a fun romp, and you should see it.\n\nAnd that's why the argument of manipulation doesn't matter when it comes to ""Bowling for Columbine."" No matter how you look at the facts, they hold water. A dead person is a dead person. So what if Moore leaves things out -- he only has about two hours here. Any good spin doctor -- Moore included -- can weave straw into gold, but the facts are the facts here and they will bring you to tears. There's no denying that if you take what Moore presents to heart, you will come away from the movie simply moved.\n""Bowling for Columbine"" is a movie for true patriots, the ones who want to see this country move forward instead of stagnate in a ceasepool of violence. Sure, to some extent, ""guns don't kill people. People kill people."" But Moore tries to answer the question why. In some ways, he comes up empty, but this is a start.\nOh, by the way, I'm pro-gun ownership.\nSome people will be turned off by Moore's sarcasm and satirical treatment of his subjects. He basically ambushes a near-senile Charles Heston, but the man deserves it for his insensitivety to victims of murders by guns. The cartoon that breaks up the live-action is hilariously -- and historically -- scary. The footage from the Columbine masacre is horrifying and poingant. The man in the missle factory is blistfully unaware, and Moore whacks him for it. Is that Moore's fault?

45;292.0;1.0;8.0;This film is basically about murder, and an anti-second amendment tone rings throughout.  If people aren't using guns to kill others, they would simply use knives, and as far as accidental shootings go, sure that happens.  It happens just like any accidental deaths, including any negligence.  The answer is not gun control, it is gun education and learning how to properly handle a firearm.  You're never going to get rid of every weapon in the world, weapons were created from people who fear bigger people trying to harm them, weapons act as a deterrent for anyone wanting to harm another.  If everyone carried a gun there would be virtually no crime, yes there would be a few more accidental shootings, but the murder rate would plummett.  The 2nd amendment guarantees us the RIGHT to keep and bear arms and it shall not be infringed.  Gun carry permits arm only to keep track of who has guns should we decide to get rid of them all.  I carry a mini copy of the constitution with me, that's my gun carry permit.  This is little more that left wing propaganda used by Moore to make a meaningless point.  He uses Charlton Heston, trying to make him feel bad because a little girl was murdered by a handgun at school.  As if it were his fault,simply because he is a representitive of the NRA.  This load of garbage is also filled with rednecks who have little education, someone Moore can easily disect and make them look like knuckle dragging morons.  All in all this is somewhat entertaining if noting else to see Moore at his most ignorant.  It harps on the dark side of humanity and preaches on only the bad things which have happened in our great country.  He's just a pessimist who needs direction.;Moore Doesn't stick to real problem.

Other than that, this is like every other Michael Moore film--shameless propaganda made to stir the pot for a group that already agrees with him anyway.  Michael Moore is just another loser making a buck by generating controversy.  It's too bad people simply don't ignore this kind of stuff instead of making a big deal about it and generating interest in it.  If you are someone who is passionately anti-gun rights and want to be angered, go waste your money.

49;294.0;2.0;8.0;I just saw this movie recently, and found it frustrating to watch because so many of Moore's conclusions are transparent.  He has a tendency to ask a completely pejorative question in an interview, and then cut to a new scene without letting his subject answer.  He focuses most of the first half of the movie on Lockheed Martin, a defense contracting company in Colorado, and I don't see the connection between Lockheed and guns in schools.  This movie requires critical analysis on the part of the viewer, because Moore's strategy seems to be to throw every argument (no matter how farfetched) at the viewer and see what sticks.;Somewhat Frustrating to Watch

As such, people watching the film are likely to make immediate assumptions about the quality and veracity of the film based on their position on the political spectrum.

His initial, left-wing tendency is to blame the amount of violence (specifically gun violence) in the United States on (1) the number of guns and the ease of acquiring them, and (2) the poverty-racism combo.  In the end, he has dismissed these reasons and others to settle on a more insidious and difficult-to-fix observation: that the U.S. (as a nation, as a people) are overly and inappropriately afraid, and that fear leads them to self-protection in the form of preemptive violence (as a nation attacking other nations and as citizens attacking each other).\n\nThat this is a documentary to advance a particular point-of-view is obvious.  However, Moore is generally (and wisely) a non-judgemental interviewer on screen.  Of course, he doesn't need to supply commentary over Charlton Heston's self-righteous indignation that he has every right to hold a pro-gun rally in the same city as the Columbine massacre, a mere 2 weeks later.  Perhaps in the light of fair play, he includes interviews with a number of Michigan militia members who are very forthright and even convincing in their defense of the 2nd ammendment.\n\nIt turns out, in the final analysis, that much-maligned shock-rocker Marilyn Manson supplies the kernal of the film, with the most concise and compelling summary of Moore's thesis: that U.S. culture is one of ""fear and consumption - as long as you're afraid, you'll buy stuff.""  In fact, fear is used to sell goods: ""Cut to commercial... buy Colgate or no one will talk to you because your breath smells bad... If you have pimples the girls won't want to f*** you...""  If fear is used effectively to sell toothpaste, it's an indication of how the undercurrent of fear runs through country.  Likewise, as one member of the Michigan militia puts it, ""When someone attacks you, you need to be able to defend yourself in the best manner possible.""  Note that she uses the word ""when"", not ""if"" - for these people it's a foregone conclusion that violence will happen, it's just a matter of time.\n\nHowever, if Michael Moore is convinced that guns are not the problem, he has not convinced me.  When comparing gun-murder statistics between Canada and the U.S., for example, he points out that per capita, Canadians have as many guns, but the gun murder rate is 1/10.  However, he neglects to point out that guns are used in fewer crimes, for example, because it's hard to sneak into a store or bank concealing the kinds of guns (long-barrel shotguns and rifles) that are common in Canada.  Assault guns and other semi-automatic weapons are outright illegal, and handguns are severely restricted (in some provinces, it's illegal to have them in the home, they must be stored at the gun club).  If you only look at guns that are specifically designed to kill people (as opposed to animals), per capita ownership in the U.S. is much higher than in other Western countries.\n\nThere are other sleights-of-hand that Moore uses that harm his thesis by lowering credibility.  For example, he rightfully compares the state-sanctioned destruction of American indiginous peoples with the state-sanctioned destruction of Jews in the Third Reich, but then goes on to imply that NATO's campaign in Kosovo was somehow equivalent (in spirit if not in scale).  He then goes further by speculating that the military violence performed by an army ordered by a commander-in-chief (Clinton, the Bushes) is somehow equivalent to school-age kids murdering classmates.  There is a very distinct difference between military killing and civic killing, which is enshrined in U.S. and international law, not to mention in most of the major religions.\n\nNotwithstanding these objections, Moore is still convincing - it is fear that drives people to barricade themselves into gated communities, join militias, and keep loaded .45 Magnums under their pillows at night.  He is also convincing that the fear is generally unfounded - violent crime in the U.S. is decreasing while reporting of it is way up.  Most importantly, because this is a popular film, the arguments are presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking way, so this film is recommended.\n\nThe 2-disc DVD edition contains some interesting extras, but they are mostly more philosophising and political commentary from Moore.  It's a bit self-aggrandising because, ss he himself points out in the introduction to the audio commentary, everything he has to say is in the film and needs no more explanation (he then turns the commentary over to his interns, secretaries, etc. in a wonderfully socialistic gesture).";Guns don't kill people - fear does
25;298.0;2.0;7.0;"I can't see how the anti-gun movement is anything less than yet another radical feminist assault on the alpha male.  I mean, let's face it, women don't own guns, don't use guns, don't want to have anything to do with guns.  This comes in sharp contrast to the relationship men have with guns where firearms are seen as items of recreation, tools of security, a safety insurance for them and their loved ones.  This sense of safety, security, and perhaps even empowerment amongst men is something the feminist movement absolutely WILL NOT tolerate.  Every man must be emasculated because if a feminist were being robbed in her home or on the street and a man (say perhaps a boyfriend, husband, or father) came up and blew the robber away this feminist would have a hard time justifying her crackpot ideology.  And of course the magnum opus of the Flower Power generation was that ideas never need to be justified so long as we feel ""sincerely"" about them.  This has very little to do with guns and everything to do with feminist attempts to correct male behavior.  They'd want to take swords and sheilds away if we had them.\n\nNot suprisingly the already passified and waif Michael Moore had no qualms about reflecting these views in his film which is quite suprising given that Moore himself grew up in Kent, Michigan, a town where street gangs and other scum keep the citizenry in a constant state of fear.  This is hardly anything new for urban America where women can't walk down the street at night, where adults can't even correct wild teenagers in public for fear of being pistol whipped.\n\nOf course Moore presents no solutions to these problems but the idea that the police, given enough time and money, would be able to get things under control is always assumed.  And that's exactly what this boils down to: Moore's and the anti-gun movement's inability to come to terms with the fact that any normal kind of police presence isn't going to be able to control crimes against civilians.\n\nThere are restrictions on state power and naturally criminals use that to their advantage.  This is because we live in a free society, well, at least we used to.  People don't want to see a team of cops on every corner, in every building, in every subway car because realistically that is what it would take to get crime under control.  That's what it took in New York but what about the other hundreds of cities that don't have a hundred billion dollar budget and who have citizens that don't want to live in a police state?  Well...\n\nThey could look to the Second Amendment but of course Moore has his own twist on that idea, ridiculously trying to cast the Right to Bear Arms as a ""right to overthrow tyranny.""  The thing Moore fails to realize was that the Bill of Rights was written before the French Revolution and before Marxism; back when the idea that a few farmers could topple a central government would've been seen by anyone, especially the elites, as utterly preposterous.  More than likely I would think that the Second Amendment was written with folks on the frontier in mind where having a tomahawk sunk into your skull was far from an uncommon event.  Also this was written at a time when a great deal of the police work (keeping in mind that most folks did not live in cities) and keeping a state of order was done by regular folks.  Defending yourself and your household would have, in most cases, been an entirely personal endeavor.\n\nIt's not so much repulsive as it is bizarre watching Michael Moore go to work on these little projects of his.  I mean, in a documentary that is supposed to be about gun control he spends about a half hour on the Oklahoma City Bombing.  What an attack that was carried out with a truck bomb has to do with guns or gun control I'll never know.  Instead it's just a pathetically calculated excuse for Moore to mention that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols happened to be gun owners.  Look, these terrible people owned guns so if you own one you'll be terrible just like them!  Even Hitler had a gun!  You don't want to be Hitler do you?  Endlessly amateurish.  Infinitely infantile.\n\nIt's really weird the way Moore is seen by so many millions as the lovable champion of the people.  Sort of like a pretentious and much fatter version of John Candy.  The truth is Michael Moore cares about the average person's problems but only in the same way that every one else in Hollywood cares about the average person which is not so much caring about them as it is wanting to make them ""better.""  Typical Marxist hatred of the Middle Class.  There's no place for this garbage in Middle or Working Class America.\n\nWouldn't it be better living in a world where instead of finding helpless victims criminals found themselves getting pumped full of lead?  I'll give it 2 stars because it was at least watchable.";The Hollywood Propaganda Machine In Full Motion
91;299.0;5.0;8.0;I bought this DVD a few months ago, after seeing it not in the local theater, but at an alternative theater. This movie was, as all of Michael Moore's films, hillariously sad. I particularly like a short two minute scene that the makers of South Park created, called The History of America. It is very funny, and so very true. All I have to say is that I love this movie and that I love Michael Moore. I also would give his newest film, Fahrenheit 9/11, five stars, except it only just came out in theaters, not yet on DVD. But I can't wait to see it when it does!!;Bowling for Columbine
92;300.0;5.0;8.0;... Help me god, I loved it.  Funny, touching, even --shock-- charming, this satirical documentary is brilliant.  And yes, I am a conservative Republican...;What Can I Say?
98;301.0;3.0;8.0;"Alright... I had to do it... Bowling For Columbine. The Review.\n\n First of all, I heard nothing but rave reviews for this film from a lot of people out in America, including the Academy Awards (?), so I thought... maybe I should check it out?\n\n After watching, I can say that I should have referred back to that time when I thought it would be a good idea to watch The English Patient because of the Academy Awards... I was fairly unimpressed. But then again, what can I expect? I've seen Michael Moore's work before and I should KNOW that he's not doing a true documentary, but really, he's trying to write propaganda. OK... Point noted... Propaganda can be interesting... How else could Hitler have enrolled as many youth? In fact, for sheer entertainment value, Bowling For Columbine is pretty entertaining... There are a lot of humorous parts, and as a coherent unit, this movie does ok... It's really too bad that it's so driven by Mr. Moore's views rather than by those pesky FACTS.\n\n For example, instead of attacking the person who was responsible for allowing a gun to get in the hands of a young child who eventually killed another child, he decided to pick a fight with Dick Clark, because Mr. Clark didn't pay enough money for the mother of said child to be able to afford her rent... Um... Dick Clark? So you're saying that because this child's mother works at a Dick Clark restaurant and doesn't make enough to live on, that's why her kid killed another kid? Sounds like she's in DESPARATE need of an education and a new job... But is that DICK CLARK's FAULT?\n\n Well, on some very 7 steps to Kevin Bacon logic, yeah, that kind of works... but... The kid wouldn't have a gun if his uncle didn't have possession of it. His Uncle, as I recall, was a convicted felon, which means that just having possession of the gun in the house is against the law, another felony, in fact but... Dick Clark is at fault... Hmmm... THAT MAKES SENSE!\n\n Another interesting tidbit is that, though Charlton Heston does an interview in this movie, and the interview DOES make him sound like a completely bigotted racist in the context it was used, Mr. Moore also replays a NRA Convention quote from Mr. Heston saying ""from my cold dead hands."" This statement is shocking in the context it's referred to (the NRA Convention soon after Columbine, in Denver), and sounds like possibly the most heartless and poorly thought-out speech ever... It's really too bad that the speech happened in a completely different town at a completely different time... Admittedly, Mr. Heston did well enough putting his foot in his mouth in his interview with Mr. Moore, but if you're going to quote him out of context in another situation, then you might as well ignore the entire interview, as it's edited and possibly out of context as well. It's like taking a video of someone and turning it into a picture... While the video may look perfect, you can always make someone look like an idiot by catching them in a still frame with their eyes closed, mouth open, and head cocked to some strange position...\n\n As I said before, this is entertaining propaganda. It moves along at a brisk pace, has some humorous parts, and some interesting footage of the Columbine shootings that I had never seen before, but aside from that, I have trouble accepting this as a ""documentary"" because of errors in the facts and extremely edited interviews that appear to take quotes out of context.\n\n If it weren't humorous at times, this would have gotten a star. I gave it three, because it's considerably more interesting than the Nazi Propaganda efforts, probably because of a much more light-hearted approach. Reefer Madness still enjoys a great number of sales these days, even though anyone who's seen it can only enjoy it for the value of how WRONG it was, so maybe this can compare when it's all said and done...\n\n If you're interested in a documentary with facts, check the History channel... If you'd like to hear Michael Moore's sometimes humorously portrayed opinion on guns, Republicans and wackos, then you should check this film out... It's sure to impress Me? I'll stick with the history channel.";Entertaining, but completely flawed

They give more insight into the man, Michael Moore. In the past, I have always voted against gun control, but this film actually changed my opinion of the subject. What I find as the brilliance of this project is that it deals with a serious subject and does so in a manner that is both humorous and respectful of the matter at hand.\n\n What I found to be of greatest interest in this DVD pack was the Charlie Rose Interview. The sheer number of deaths in this country by gun violence is staggering and I recommend that whether or not people agree with the Director's politics, that one views this subject with an open mind to the fact that innocent people are dying from gun violence in absurd numbers, and moreso than any other ""Enlightened"" nation.

Even I don't agree in all his opinions,  this documental is an important reference for the future of the story in USA.;Merciless film of Michael Moore!
115;305.0;4.0;8.0;"Michael Moore is very effective at mixing polemics with facts, but in the process he often contradicts himself.  While this movie is ostensibly about the Columbine shootings, it evolves into an attack against the weapons manufacturing industry, K-Mart and the National Rifle Association, as those most responsible for the widespread proliferation of firearms and ammunition in America.  But, as Moore points out, Canada has easy access to many of the same weapons, yet does not have such a violent culture, noting that less than 200 persons are killed by firearms each year, as opposed to 11,000 in America.  So, it would seem the old adage, ""guns don't kill people, people kill people,"" would aptly apply to this movie.\nThe violent nature of Americans is one that has befuddled sociologists and psychologists for decades.  As Moore points out, American history is no more violent than is German, French or British history, yet these countries have a much lower murder rate than the US.  Moore gets nearer his target when he illustrates that the ""fear factor"" seems to be the underlying factor, with commercial and political interests using it to get Americans to buy into the gun and security industry that has become such a pervasive part of our society.  He contrasts this with Canada, where even in Windsor, across the river from Detroit, many Canadians don't lock their doors at night.  For whatever reason, Americans seem to have had it inculcated into their heads that someone is out there to get them and that they better have a deadbolt lock and a gun on their bedside table.\nEventually, he circled back to the shootings at Columbine, even showing the eerie sequence of events on school cameras. The kids who shot up the school were classic loners, who used guns to vent their frustration on the school, weeks before graduation.  What galled Moore and most parents of the school kids at Columbine was that Charleton Heston pitched up in Denver within a week to promote the NRA.  He did the same in Flint following the tragic shooting of a 6-year girl by a 6 year-old boy. While Moore never gets behind the reasons, he does corner Heston for an interview at film's end.\nBut, it is his assault on K-Mart that yields the best rewards.  He showed up at the national center with two of the boys who survived the shootings and demanded that K-Mart stop its sale of 9 mm bullets, which were used in the Columbine shootings.  Much to his surprise and that of the media that had gathered to film the standoff, K-Mart agreed not only to stop selling 9 mm bullets but to phase out the sale of all ammunition in 90 days.  Moore showed once again that you can stand up to the big boys and fight for what is right and win.\nUnfortunately, his polemical stance often clouds this work as he vents his frustration with Clinton and Bush for not dealing with the issue of gun control like he thinks they should.  He used Kosovo to highlight the indifference Moore perceived, by noting that a major bombing campaign occured the same day as the Columbine shootings.";Fascinating but flawed view of America's gun culture.
118;306.0;3.0;8.0;"I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Moore or his politics, but I check out opposing viewpoints to reexamine my presuppositions and alter or strengthen them as necessary.  I've heard a lot of general scuttlebutt about him (loud, liberal, etc.), and read the Amazon reviews concerning ""Bowling for Columbine"", so I decided to see for myself what all the controversy was about.\nThe movie's thesis boils down to this: Americans exist in a state of fear, so they use guns to kill anyone who's a real or perceived threat.  What generates this climate of high anxiety?  It's stoked by the media, with continual coverage of violent crime, corporate mischief, natural disasters, and so on, along with the government and its endless travel advisories and terror alerts.  How do Americans cope?  With excessive material consumption, encouraged by a constant media advertising blitz.  So, we live in perpetual fear, consume beyond our means to medicate ourselves, work at jobs we hate to fund our consumption, buy a gun or two to protect our precarious lifestyle, and cap anyone who messes with our precious consumables or threatens our means of buying them.  What a life.\nThis seems to be a reasonable diagnosis of a national problem.  Marilyn Manson, an obvious and convenient scapegoat for the average person's dysfunctions, explains the cycle of fear, consumption, and violence quite well when questioned by Mr. Moore.  Just across the border, Mr. Moore establishes that our Canadian neighbors have about as many guns per household as we do.  But they don't blast away at each other nearly as much.  What's their secret?  A positive, laid-back frame of mind, as demonstrated (and encouraged) by a softer-edged media and mellow politicians.  Heck, they don't even lock their doors, as Mr. Moore demonstrates by walking in on a couple of unsuspecting Canucks.  So far, he's done a great job of identifying the existence of an American malady.  At this point in the film, I was prepared for an equally sound treatment of the logical solution:  Americans need a fundamental change of heart, or at least an attitude adjustment, eh.\nHowever, Mr. Moore does not examine an alteration of the American psyche as a possible remedy.  That would've elevated ""Bowling for Columbine"" to greatness.  Instead, he embarks on a crusade to get ammunition out of K-Mart stores and gets in the face of NRA president Charlton Heston.  Despite spending much of the film establishing internal motivations as the problem, Mr. Moore takes the easy way out by blaming guns instead of the people who use them against others.  What good does it do to focus on a symptom instead of the disease?  It will only manifest itself in a different way.  Using Mr. Moore's reasoning, we'd be better off getting rid of our television sets (not a bad idea, actually).\nDespite its flaws, I recommend that everyone see ""Bowling for Columbine.""  Mr. Moore has done an excellent job of diagnosing an American problem.  However, anyone seeking thoughtful discourse or debate about a reasonable solution will have to look elsewhere.";Good diagnosis, but falls short on the solution.

Most of the time he came off as a crazy loon asking very stupid questions.

Moore tries to get to the bottom of the reasons for the Columbine massacre, and he uncovers a nation that is pumped full of fear needlessly and is therefore driven to fill their houses with guns to feel secure instead of addressing the issues behind the fear.\nThe fascinating film concludes with Moore receiving an interview opportunity at Heston's Coldwater Canyon mansion -- and this alone makes the film worth viewing.  However, there's even more to it than the memorable interview.  It just may shake you to your very foundations, if you're open-minded enough to receive his important message.;Speaks to all

Listen in awe as both dates, and locations are blatantly lied about.\nThis isn't a documentary, heck, it isn't even good television.;Utter Tripe
374;322.0;5.0;8.0;My sincerest thanks to Michael Moore for bravely creating a movie that doesn't allow the viewer to walk in, sit down and just stare at the visions before them. This movie makes every viewer (republican, democrat, green - anyone) take a serious look at the things we put our energy into. This country is led by hate and greed and most important, fear. This movie should be a mandatory part of high school curriculum. Everyone should see this movie if for no other reason than to conduct a reality check.\nThank you Michael Moore!;Finally!
382;323.0;4.0;8.0;"Michael Moore takes on one of the biggest topics in American culture with Bowling for Columbine(the title is taken from the activity the two Columbine killers were participating in just hours before the killing spree).  Unfortunately maybe it requires more time to delve more completely into this topic.  This isn't to say he doesn't do a marvelous job in the time he uses.  He brings up many points for debate, but he also leaves some hanging.  He spends a good amount of time delving into the perception of the ""dangerous black male"" only to sort of drop it part way through.\nThe Cartoon of American History was about the funniest and most accurate portrayal of American History I have ever seen.\nHis conversation with Charleston Heston seems the only possible way to end the movie.  You get a sense of Heston earlier in the movie and the conversation at the end only seems to confirm your suspicions about him.\nIn short it's like watching a serious debate at MTV speed.";Not sure whether to be awed or confused.
386;324.0;5.0;8.0;"Intentive viewers and fans may not be able to wait much longer for Michael Moore's next opus, ""Farenheit 9/11"" but they can get a headstart by obtaining 2002's ""Bowling For Columbine"", probably Moore's finest work to date. You cant ask for much more from a documentary, I mean come on, how many documentaries have such fine examples of investigative journalism, personal insights, provocative and just down right humorous interviews thrown together with the likes of Marilyn Manson, Matt Stone and Charleton Heston and still hold together like a fine baked cake?\nNot many, and for that reason you can't deny Moore's approach to 'non-fictional' film making by balancing the serious with the humorous. Be it the candid interview with the president of the NRA or the insightful look into Americas culture of fear, it is not to be mistaken soley as an anti-gun movie but also a film that instigates and promotes the catalyst of discussion and change within our society.

Moore shows lots of statistics comparing the states to many European countries and even our neighbors up North the Canadians.  This really makes you aware of just how crazy us Americans can get.  The only thing that was left out of the movie was what's the answer?  Do we ban guns, sell bullets for $5,000s each, we never get a clear answer.  Still its a heck of a ""it'll make you think"" movies.  Watch and attempt to get sane people.";Very informative movie, anyone wanna be Canadian?
447;329.0;5.0;8.0;This is an incredible and powerful movie - one that many reviewers missed the point of entirely.  For example the idiot who blames violence on ethnic minorities, which Michael Moore addressed in regards to Canada, something our hateful friend forgot to mention, which has a significant minority population and still significantly lower crime rates.  It examines the origins and nature of our violent society, and was much more anti-violence than anti-gun.  I never even got the impression he wanted guns banned, he showed that guns in places like Canada don't cause the same level of violence, he just wants people to THINK about how our society ended up being so full of fear, hate and violence.  This is a must-see movie if you ever truly thought about issues like gun control and more importantly if you haven't.  I have never liked guns and always advocated for stricter control, but after seeing this movie, and thinking about the issues he pointed out it is easy to see that our culture, not our guns, are what really puts us in danger from each other.  I still think guns should be at least as controlled as a car, but I no longer think that it would solve half as many problems. See the movie, listen to the message and think about it!;See this movie
449;330.0;5.0;8.0;"There is a long, repetitive diatribe a couple reviews up in which the reviewer gets on Moore's case for his biased portrayal of the subjects of this movie.  I think that reviewer is missing the point.  Gun control is not the main thrust of the movie, it's that Americans seem to have a great deal more fear than citizens of other countries.  The fact that people shoot criminals is not a rebuttal of that argument, in fact it's more proof.  The reviewer states that there is less violent crime in states where people are allowed to carry concealed weapons, a solution which boils down to ""make criminals afraid as well"".  Anecdotal or not, the evidence presented fits Moore's hypothesis that fear drives much of the violence in this country.  A reading of Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent"" (which I'm sure Moore must have drawn from) should further convince you of the media's role in forming public opinion, and in this case fear.\nIn my personal experience as a Canadian living in the U.S. I find that there is a big difference between the two countries, and that is the difference between capitalism and socialism.  Capitalism can be summed up as ""every man for himself"", while socialism is based on spreading wealth to those who need it.  One engenders competition, the other cooperation.  In America you take what you can get because no one is going to hand anything to you, so naturally you're going to protect what you already have a little more vigorously.  That difference goes a long way to explaining why Americans are more afraid, and why they feel the need to own guns.  In any event, I grew up without locking my door, although I sure lock it now.\nWhatever your politics you can't deny that Moore documents a great deal of absurd and dysfunctional behavior in this movie.  He makes the viewer think and more importantly, take a stand.  It is riveting, heartbreaking, disgusting and funny, all at the same time.  this could be the most powerful movie I've seen in years.\nOh, and I'm no fan but Marilyn Manson was one of the most intelligent people interviewed by Moore.  He gained my respect, if not my admiration of his music.";a movie everyone should watch
453;331.0;5.0;8.0;i thought that the documentary was well done because he made it as fair as it could be to gun lovers, and gun control lovers.  instead of just giving his opinions, he tried to show facts and evidence that may support or reject various discrepencies concerning gun violence in America.  i feel that i could recommend any of my friends to watch it, regardless of their stand on gun control.;As fair as it could be (or close)
38;332.0;1.0;7.0;As a propagandist, Moore performs quite adequately but, I suspect, only when he is preaching to the committed Left.  However, his treatment of the aged Charlton Heston is disgraceful and devious.\n\nA self-serving journalist and undeserving of praise.;Left-wing propaganda
11;333.0;1.0;5.0;So many technical lies about guns and gun control and the American people this is unusable except as the rankest vile progressive propaganda.  If you believe most any of this is true you need a reality check.  Moore stacks more BS than most and does it with such hypocritical assurance that only the gullible will be taken in.;More lies than are allowable
12;334.0;1.0;5.0;It's deliberately misleading, cunningly edited to misrepresent the facts, full of falsehoods, misinformation and insults. I don't think that anyone who owns guns does so out of fear of rampaging minorities, that the NRA and the KKK are connected, that Charlton Heston and the NRA went to Colorado to taunt the victim's families, that Moore walked into a bank and walked out with a free gun, etc. etc. And that's just off the top of my head. One definite factual error (i.e. blatant lie): I know for a fact that an American can't just walk into a Walmart in Canada and buy all the ammunition he wants. Moore's work is more Leni Riefenstahl than Ken Burns or Errol Morris. Unfortunately you can't convince the True Believers who think his films have any credibility whatsoever.;Worse Than Lies
477;335.0;3.0;8.0;"How anyone can declare this movie as ""hilarious"" or ""a howl"", ""a hoot"" etc ... is beyond me. Yes, it has some laughs, and some good ones, but, considering the disturbing facts it points out about the American existence ie. 11,000+ murders to Canada's (and most other industrialized countries') fewer than 200, it's hard to leave the film feeling ""refreshed"" as with a good comedy.\nMoreover, while Moore does a good job of ferreting out the facts, he also leaves us with an ambiguous feeling that the violence is a product of racism, and does nothing really to address that issue. He sandbags Charlton Heston and Dick Clark shamelessly, and while the viewer is initially brought along on Moore's side, reflection gives one pause. Why couldn't he have been honest about his intentions and allowed for real debate? As it stands, though, Clark and Heston look like unfeeling monsters, while Moore comes off as though he were some kind of crusading saint. Which wouldn't be a bad thing to do, considering the level of the tragedy of gun violence in America and that something really should be done to solve it, instead of sweeping it under the rug, or continuing to allow the media and gun manufacturers to profit from it. However, this film is designed, intentionally or not, to appeal mainly to left-of-center audiences, and alienate those who do not share gun control sympathies. In this regard, if this were to be intended to be used as a tool for change, this film fails because it is basically ""preaching to the choir"". Moore should have spent some time getting into the heads of those who would most oppose a change in our current gun culture and structure his film to effect those folks, and spent a little less time trying to structure his film to make himself look like a hero. For this reason, I do not wholeheartedly agree with this film, but I do recommend it to all Americans who care even the slightest about the violence in our streets and what can be done to make our country safe. This film doesn't provide the answers, but does, very forcefully beg the question and provide grist for debate.";Spotty, tenuously funny, but with a catch.
478;336.0;5.0;8.0;"""Bowling for Columbine"" is a documentary film that charts the course of firearms and violence in American culture.  The Columbine High School shootings serve as the catalyst for the talented Michael Moore as he attempts to answer the question ""How could it have happened?""  The film points out how fear, irresponsible media, misguided government programs and racial stereotyping contribute to the staggering death rate in America. Compound these social ills with the ease with which firearms are obtained and it becomes apparent why the ""greatest"" nation on earth surpasses all other developed countries in deaths attributed to firearms.  The film is smart, funny at times, serious always and ultimately saddening.  It is my hope that this documentary makes its way into America's education system.  Until then pass the word.  This one is Highly Recommended!";Exceptional!
484;337.0;5.0;8.0;"I was truly surprised by this movie.  I've seen Moore's other films, and this one is, I think, easily his best.  It's not often these days when a movie makes you really think long after you exit the theatre.  I don't care if you're a bed-wetting lefty or a gun-packing, bible thumping conservative: get yourself to the theatre and see this movie.  You won't regret it.  It doesn't pander to a particular political agenda quite the way his last two films did, and does an admirable job of trying to address the issue of gun violence in the USA from all sides.  This is an absolutely hilarious, absorbing and fascinating film.  Others have already expressed all of this quite eloquently, so I thought I'd scrutinize Moore's use of Canada in the film as a sort of comparison with which to measure America's gun-related societal ills:\nI was proud to see that during the scenes in Canada, my neighborhood was the one that Moore was sent to when he asked someone to direct him to the Canadian equivalent of a ghetto/slum (Ha ha ha!)  And while some Canadians may say (and have expressed on this very page) that Moore exaggerated our easy-going, don't-lock-the-doors mentality and relative safety, I can honestly say as a lifelong resident of downtown Toronto that it isn't quite as misleading and Pollyanna a portrayal as some might think.\nKeep in mind that Canadians are modest about flaunting their good qualities and that we too suffer, though on a much smaller scale than Americans, from the constant barrage of fear-inspired American media which creates unwarranted and irrational fear about our surroundings (we get COPS, America's Most Wanted et all) What Moore didn't have time mention was that this ""slum"" that he was sent to is, even more so than many other Toronto neighborhoods, extremely diverse, culturally, racially, economically (it was a planned mixed-income urban community created in the 1970s by wacky leftist politicians) and even though most of us live in public housing and about 50% are classified as low (or no) income, we have one of the lowest crime rates in a city of low crime rates.  And yes, I know people here who don't lock their doors (my mom never did when I was growing up).\nWhen an American friend of the family visited us here a few years ago, in one of our conversations over dinner he let it slip that A) he could not believe how kids in our neighborhood were allowed to play freely on the streets (and no one can remember anyone ever getting kidnapped or murdered or anything of the sort) and B) he was surprised at the huge number of multiracial families here (meaning black/white in this case, of course).  That he should choose to remark on these two points is fairly revealing about American society, I think, and ties into the issues Moore was trying to tackle in his film.  So Michael Moore's portrayal of Canada is not as far from the truth as one might imagine.  I could have taken Mr. Moore to a rougher, poorer neighborhood nearby to ours, but even there one cannot ignore the sense of community and the considerable lack of racial segregation.  Unfortunately, many Torontonians have not spent time in such neighborhoods and are increasingly buying into the American stereotypes of ghettos and applying them to neighborhoods here that, outwardly at least, seem to fit the mold.  These are obviously not the Canadians that Moore interviewed for the film.  Having spent a lot of time in the USA, I can say that many (though by no means all or most) Canadians, not entirely unlike Americans, are unaware of how good they have it.  There is a funny true tale about Toronto that illustrates our general attitudes around guns and gun-violence: in the early 90s, an American ""expert"" on violence in schools was asked - presumably by an overworked, overwrought white school principal who makes his home in the burbs (and I say that based in my experience with so many of them) - to come do a speech at what was considered one of Toronto's toughest inner-city high schools.  During a particularly dramatic moment in the speech, the speaker asked the students to simply raise their hands if they knew or knew of any teenager who had a gun in his or her possession.  The students looked at each other but no one raised their hands.  In a matter of seconds, the whole auditorium had erupted in laughter. (Canadians for you, eh?)  Like those kids, I never knew anyone who owned a firearm in my inner-city high school (in rural Canadian areas gun ownership is much more common).\nGetting back on topic -- while it's true that Moore offers no easy solution for America's gun violence woes, there is, I think, a prevailing, simple but too often ignored moral to the film: we should all try harder to ""love thy neighbor"" and gosh, maybe even TRUST thy neighbor in time.";Wow
491;338.0;5.0;8.0;Just want to add my vote that this documentary is Moore's best film technically, with the cleanest editing and most beautiful, fluid visual and sound choreography of his past 3 films. And, it shows how much he loves America and believes in its people and their potential. In fact, he may have created the most important film of our time.\nI feel it is important to write this review because some of the reviewers think Michael Moore (and this film) is anti-gun. They also think he wants us to walk away angry. I disagree. Michael Moore shows us his NRA life-time member card as well as his trophies won in shooting contests. The main theme of the film is, why does America have over 10,000 homicides a year when other countries with just as many guns and ethnicities have under 1,000? Why do Americas keep guns in the house that are not used for sport, fully loaded, when in other countries people (who own guns for sport) don't? Why do Americans, who statistically are in no more danger of being the victim of a crime than anyone in any other part of the world, distrust their neighbor to this extent?\nHe also delves into the subject of whether we should blame rock music for the violent behavior of high school students, and if so, why not also blame bowling (which is what the kids who blew up Columbine did before they went on their rampage)?  But seriously, he seems to say -- why not blame ourselves? After all, on the same day, America was bombing a third-world country.\nMoore also confronts the very important but little-mentioned fact that the media exploits crime, exacerbating peoples' fears, and in doing so, exploits the idea that most criminals are black and hispanic (he fully exploits the irony, that the media blows up petty crimes of minorities while caucasion white-collar executives at companies such as Enron and WorldCom are taking the economy of our entire country into a downward spiral).\nBowling for Columbine gives all of us much to think about, and hopefully will be seen by as many people as possible. Films like this can help us all to remember our responsibility as citizens, not to allow ourselves to act out of fear, but instead, out of love for our neighbor and hope for the world that our children will inherit.;Should be required viewing for all Americans

I think it is also Michael's best.  This movie doesn't point fingers.  It doesn't lay blame (...directly).  It presents the facts and leave it to open to the audience to make the conclusion.  There are no answers given the film.\n""Bowling for Columbine"" is an exploration of violence in American society.  Michael honestly can not understand why we are so violent.  He goes through the points that we have as much of a history of violence as other countries, as much violence in our media as other countries, and as many guns in our homes as Canadians.  So why do we have such a staggering amount of gun deaths in this country compared to others?\nI'm not here to give you the answer (and neither is Michael), though they seem obvious after watching the movie.  I think what Michael does right with his film this time is hold back.  He is not nearly as incendiary as in his TV show or books.  He let's the people involved speak for themselves.\nAgree or disagree with it's points, this is a movie EVERYONE should see.  I am taking everyone I care about to this movie.  It has a few disturbing laughs, and some scenes that really choked me up.\nYou may have an emotional response to this movie, but PLEASE don't let that scare you off.  I found this film completely inspirational, because it shows that there is still someone out there who believes he can make a difference...and he actually does.";It takes a lot to make me speechless...
19;340.0;3.0;6.0;BFC's very success as a piece of art is its undoing as a piece of social commentary. Before I go on let me briefly sum up the film: MM attempts to discover what is wrong with America- specifically violence in America. The Columbine shootings in spring of 1999 are MM's starting point. MM tries to point out the dubious links posited by the media monster- brilliantly portrayed in a montage of `scares' thrown out by the media- things from Halloween candy to weight loss products. This is an avenue worth pursuing, & the `scaring' of Americans into becoming consumers of anything that will substitute as a nipple is a great point. But it's made by shock rocker Marilyn Manson (a Columbine scapegoat), not MM, & then immediately dropped. MM also is at his best when he details corporate America's need to portray black men as `the problem' despite far more crime being perpetuated by white & white-collared sorts. Instead, we get a whole bunch of amusing, but pointless red herrings- the Michigan Militia, the Nirvana of Canadian existence (aptly showing how good the Canadian health care system is, but woefully neglecting the severe curtailing of Canadian civil liberties- most notably free speech- in pursuit of this goal), workfare programs- which I agree are terrible because they perpetuate an underclass, yet do not let a bad single mother whose 6 year old son killed another 6 year old girl off the hook (as MM tries to imply), a nasty Dick Clark- who employed said bad single mother for slave wages in a mall restaurant, a doddering & senile Charlton Heston- whom MM dishonestly snookered in to an attack interview, & then- in the film's most pompous & sickening moment- left the murdered 6 year old's photo on Heston's property, as if to imply that CH was responsible for her death- not the boy, nor the mother. I admire- & LOVE- how MM uses the media's tools against them in such a screeding fashion. But he has become what he hates with this distortion. Nowhere does MM follow up on the public's & media's appetite for sensationalism- instead he uses 2 dimwitted boys who survived being shot at Columbine to shame K-Mart in to removing bullets from their store's inventory. 1 can argue the rightness or wrongness of this act- I think they were within their rights to demand such, but it's ultimately a futile act. BUT the point is this was not done for any other reason than to bring MM's film to a climax. Instead of showing a problem, discussing its causes, & effects, & then proposing a solution- which a true documentary does, MM's film simply drops the ball at the end, settling for its own 2 hours of sensationalized splendor in MM's sun. The film is much more about Michael Moore's need to preen & pat himself on the back, than in provoking any real debate. Behind us, at the theater, was a typical professorial type who Pavlovianly jeered at the right wingers, tsk-tsked at the appropriate moments of their stupidity, all the while, under his breath, mm-mming at the enlightened left wingers who, truthfully, to an objective viewer, came off being just as stupid as the Michigan Militia men- in their own predictably obtuse ways. Think long of Pogo's injunction about enemies while viewing this film.\n  Still, the film would make Leni Riefenstahl proud. & it would make `true' Liberals proud, as well, were the film not so laced with  truths & such. MM has stated that he thinks only 10-20% of people who see his work will get it right away- therefore he has to distort with humor. Well, the same ratio might apply when it comes to the truth in MM's docs....In short, Bowling for Columbine needed alot more true depth, & alot less Moore.;Less Moore

The movie is full of questions which are simply answered by more questions.  For instance, Moore seems anti-gun yet he is a card-carrying member of the NRA.  People blame our culture for the violence, yet Canada is exposed to the same culture and doesn't have the appalling murder-rate this country does.  While it doesn't answer the question, it explores all (well, most of) the issues in the debate.  He ultimately leaves the question of who is to blame for the gun violence up to the you.;Should be required viewing in schools
80;345.0;2.0;7.0;"The problem with this documentary isn't as everyone states.  I can honestly say I didn't read all of the reviews, but I have read some.  Personally, I would say Michael Moore's argument isn't about gun control or even that the NRA is a bad organization.  He consistently states that Canada, Britain, Germany have guns, why don't they have as many ""gun"" murders (keep an eye on this statistic, just because a country doesn't have as many gun murders doesn't mean they don't have other types of murders).  The argument is that the fear driven society leads to bad situations.  Now this is a good argument.\n\nWhere he goes wrong is with the media.  He demphasizes the media as the cause in this argument.  He stretches it to be the government and the NRA and the militia, and ...etc.  I believe he left out the media for a good reason, he is making a documentary.  He is one of them, enough said.\n\nFor Charlton Heston and his horrible nature in the film.  I have read that Michael Moore didn't ambush the man.  If that is true, then what is it called when you show up at a man's house and ask for an interview the next day.  One, Heston wasn't provided with a list of questions to prepare good answers.  Two, Moore immediately set in on him.  It made me sick to watch him do this to the man.  The whole thing with the picture is just BS to get the people weepy eyed.  He should have been attacking the media and not this old man.  Go around to those people reporting and show them the picture and ask how they can do this with no feeling.\n\nWatch the movie, remember to keep an eye on the media as well as the poloticians and rich white guys.  Remember keep that fear driven society running Michael Moore.";Close
105;346.0;5.0;7.0;"This is perhaps Michael Moore's greatest achievement in his career. Bowling for Columbine is a documentary that takes the air of a movie. In other words, it entertains as it educates. The accumulation of facts in the film is startling as it is fascinating. The film navigates subplot through subplot with each complimenting the other so in the end, the audience is left stunned and awed in silence to reflect on the powerful message presented in the film.\nI think one of the most important messages that this movie contains is the fact that America has fallen into a deep abyss of fear. The government, and especially the Bush administration has done such a great job of scaring the American public, that we're afraid of our next door neighbor. This movie reveals a lot about our cultures and what we value as a society.\nThe DVD itself is superb, with tons of great little features, including interviews between Michael Moore and other talk show hosts.\nBowling For Columbine is a definite must see of the year, or any year for that matter.

134;347.0;4.0;7.0;"BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, Michael Moore's unabashedly liberal, opinionated take on America's gun culture, is, if nothing else, a great piece of op-ed filmmaking that offers some valuable insights that, if you are open to hearing them, might change the way you think about not only our obsession with guns, but also change the way you look at our media. Certainly, one of the most convincing passages of the movie for me was a segment in the middle that showed how fearmongering our media can be, and how they can sometimes drum up too much fear in all of us simply by how they choose what stories to cover (""if it bleeds, it leads""). After watching that, I don't think anyone can ever truly be wholly uncritical of the media ever again.\nSo, okay, Michael Moore has the unfortunate reputation of sometimes staging what seems like ""found"" events in his films, and you cannot always trust what Moore claims to be fact in them. And some of those stunts he thinks of for his films---there's one here in which he takes two victims of Columbine and brings them to a local Walmart in an attempt to force them to faze out the selling of bullets, a stunt which actually works---can sometimes be more a debit to his argument than a credit (Moore admittedly does sometimes come off as overly smug, in here and his most recent film, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, also a great film.)\nYet, one must admit that Moore is a tremendous moviemaker, who makes his films out of passion and a need to throw certain topics into the realm of public forum via the medium of film. And if his overall message sometimes feels muddled during the course of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE---what is he really trying to say by connecting the fact that Columbine happened on the same day as one of the biggest days of bombing in Kosovo?---well, maybe that is merely the sign of a man searching for some kind of truth in a muddled political field. If this film doesn't at least make you think, then you probably haven't been receptive enough to be able to receive his message.\nWell-worthy of its Best Documentary Academy Award. Highly recommended.";Great and insightful piece of op-ed filmmaking
143;348.0;3.0;7.0;"Documentaries are tough fare to objectively review because if you disagree with the director's ideas (as I do in this case) it tends to color the entire review and minimize or shut out some of the more interesting aspecets of the film.\nIn Bowling For Columbine, Moore sets out to answer the question: Why do American's kill each other in greater numbers than any other democratic nation? Does Moore actually answer this?  Not really.  In fact, one of the most infuriating aspects of this film is that the director piles on theory after theory to answer the premise(War in Kosovo, Lockheed Martin's Littleton plant, welfare-to-work programs etc. each resulting in bits that are mildly humorous and sometimes dramatic)  but makes little headway in answering the question.  Granted, its hard to answer a question that has as many facets as crime in America while simultaneously keeping it watchable, but by the time the credits roll, we should have some kind of an answer.\nA microcosm of all the problems with the film is interview ""shock-rocker"" Marylin Manson, on whom some have tried to blame the shootings.  While rightly pointing out that a connection between the two is absurd, Moore doesn't explain how blaming it on Lockheed Martin's Littleton plant for making missles (neither Klebold nor Harris' parents worked at the plant) and such is any less absurd (incidentally it has been reported that the Littleton plant doesn't make weapons, but TV satellites).  Moore ends the scene by adding, apropos of nothing, that on the day of the shootings the president dropped more bombs on Kosovo than any day during the war.  Theories like this are regularly dropped in without really explaining if there is any hard evidence to substantiate how they link to shootings throughout the film.\nMoore's only real stab at a solution is that we should be more like Canada (a country that has more than its share of guns, but a tiny fraction of gun deaths).  Why Canada should be our model, Moore never really delivers to the viewer.  He drops hints that it may be socialized medicine, but like most everything in the film (including the theory I found most promising and believable: the media reporting violent crimes, which has been skyrocketing for quite some time vs. the violent crime rate, which has been falling for a while), he never adequately explains why!\nWhile the film's hopping from theory to theory was iritating to say the least, it was entertaining throughout and each theory usually contained a funny/scary bit or a poignant moment.  Maybe satire and not documentary would be more suitable to Moore's talents?  The bottom line is that the film is fun to watch, but it probably shouldn't be taken too seriously  as an answer to our problems";Entertaining?  You bet!  Good Documentary?  Maybe...
148;349.0;5.0;7.0;I find that this movie draws a big difference in opinion between the left and right. This movie was asking us to stop and look at why might America be the violent culture it is. Through out it you can see the Moore was trying to go certain directions with it, but found his assumptions to be not really what he was expecting. I don't think any where in this movie does it say you shouldn't own a gun, because guns are evil, it even says that Canada has a lot of guns. If Moore didn't put in his political opinions this movie would be a whole lot more accepting of the right. So when a conservative watches this movie and you don't agree with his political view then don't make that the may point in the movie. Moore brings up good questions and as Americans this is something we should be concerned about and want to stop, why should we not be concerned about people killing each other. One person mentioned that Moore has a lot of unfinished points, because he doesn't have the answer to why people kill each other, this isn't something that can be solved so simply and by one person.\nI found this movie to be very good and everyone should see it atleast once so that the question goes through our heads and maybe we can make a difference some how. To the person that talked about boycotting Farenheit 9/11, don't limit your mind. We must always look at things from both sides, so that we can understand why others feel the way they do even if we don't agree with them, understanding of each other is what the world lacks.;stop and think

195;355.0;5.0;7.0;I heard a lot of comments about this documentary, both positive and negative. Most of the negative, from conservatives turned out of be inaccurate and in some cases, total bunk. I'm not saying this is 100% factually correct. What documentary, or book ever is?  Moore deserves credit for standing up and asking the tough questions. Why did Eric Harris is Dylan Kliebold go crazy and kill 12 of their classmates and one teacher? Why does America have a higher murder rate than any developed country in the world? Why does fear and consumption dominate out society? Maybe I'm a little fed up with the lies of the right that I find any intelligent voice on the left refreshing.;EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD WATCH THIS
210;356.0;3.0;7.0;"This film is an odd duck, even for a documentary.  It's equal parts farce, propaganda, amateur speculation, and over-the-top public spectacle.  It's also a film that goes no where in particular, other than to cynically manipulate and poke fun of its targets in ways that embellish, but don't always support, Michael Moore's meandering, undisciplined commentary.\nAnd in the end, this film is about Michael Moore, more than anything else.  His hulking figure, and bitter persona, is the centerpiece.  If there was another thesis here, it was lost in all the rambling, in all the making sport of sad figures--like the aging, semi-incoherent Charlton Heston.\nThe ostensible theme is that Americans are too violent, especially teens who think nothing about bloody school rampages.  Okay.  What does Mr. Moore think?  He's all over the place. For example, from long, intermittant stretches, one would think that the availability of weapons and ammunition are the cause.  After all, Moore makes a spectacle of getting K-Mart to stop selling bullets.  But then, he marshalls compelling evidence that countries with far greater weapon ownership and availability--like Canada--have far lower violent crime rates, particularly with firearms. (Okay, so what was the point of the K-Mart exercise?)  This kind of sloppy thinking (and acting), coupled with an ending, smug tone of, ""Gosh, we don't know why Americans are so violent and stupid,"" is the film's consistent flaw.";Low rent, manipulative, entertaining--at times.
233;357.0;5.0;7.0;True enough, Bowling for Columbine is, as many reviews claim, uneven, subjective and manipulative. Sure. It's important to remember, watching it, that this is not a subjective documentary, but a film that makes a very deliberate and intentional point, just like Mike Moore's previous, smaller scale enterprises. But aside from tackling some incredibly important issues, and bringing to light some fascinating obscure information, Bowling for Columbine should be noted for being one of the finest, most powerful pieces of propaganda ever seen. That's what it is, after all - propaganda, though it supports very positive and respectable causes. Mr. Moore is a master filmmaker, who does a fantastic, wonderful work of making his point and making his viewers care about it. The music, the monologue, the animation sequences and the archive footage are all combined with the interviews (fascinating interviews with Marilyn Manson, Charlton Heston and Matt Stone, among others) to create a powerful and intense ninety minutes that would keep your eyes glued to the screen like few other documentaries could. Highly recommended, no matter what your politics are. It will either inspire you of infuriate you - it's fascinating either way.;Fascinating

240;359.0;5.0;7.0;"Over six hundred reviews strong and nothing gained, just opinions upon opinions.  Sure Michael Moore has distorted the truth in some ways to get his point across, but can you think of anyone who doesn't use rhetoric and propagandist tactics on a daily basis to gain support for their own particular cause?  I loved this movie, regardless of whether or not he distorted some of his facts.  The reason for this is Michael Moore is trying to communicate to us, everyone, liberal or conservative, that there is something inherently wrong with the society we live in.  To denounce him with comments like ""Michael Moore is a big fat idiot"" only strengthens a persons ignorance and narrow-mindedness.  This is not about Conservative or Liberal bashing.  It is a statement concerning the social dilemnas we all watch on our biased television screen, then forget about once the evening news is over.  WAKE UP!!!!!  What do think this government is doing as we speak?  You speak about a distortion of the facts?  PLEASE!!!!  It's time to get rid of this whole liberal-conservative system and start focusing on solutions, not the juvenile slander of people like David S. Rhodes, whose other review praising a conservative book states ""overall, liberals are going to hate Laura (the author) like they hate most things that are good and decent and true.""  GIVE ME A BREAK!  If that is not the most generalizing, ignorant, statement I've heard in some time!  It makes me sick (I am neither a liberal nor conservative, merely a person that chooses not to live under a label)  that people believe they have to be on one side or the other.  Americans aren't competing for title of ""Political affiliation of the Year,"" are we?  Just be content that whether you agree or disagree with Michael Moore, he is up there fighting for what he believes in, which is more than I can say for us, who just argue about his little movie.";This is a social commentary, one person's opinion
262;360.0;5.0;7.0;Don't make the mistake of thinking Bowling for Columbine is just about guns. It's more about Americans - who we are, how we came to be that way, where it's taking us whether we like it or not.\nIt beautifully illustrates a paranoia, specific to our culture, that has to be addressed if we are to have sound, sane public policy.\nThis should be shown in our schools, our Churches, Temples and Synagogues.

267;362.0;5.0;7.0;"In this documentary, Michael Moore uses his unique brand of wit to explore America's obsession with guns and violence. He depicts facts about our country's bloody past and present hitting the streets to talk to real people who are all in one way or another affected by guns. He makes you think as he tries to uncover why America has the highest death rate of people killed by guns in the world. I couldn't believe how different it is just to live in Canada. They support each other and have pride in who they are, unlike America's self-centered every-person-for-themselves attitude. The Canadian evening news actually talks about good things and their citizens don't live in constant fear. They had maybe 60 some gun related deaths in the past year to America's staggering 11,000 or so. Still, it isn't so much a film on gun control as it is a film on how we live daily in conformity, and how we are conditioned to believe things based on what we see in the media. He shows the sad stupidity of religious groups picketing a Marilyn Manson concert with the claims that Manson condones violence. But yet the hypocrites state that they won't let Manson in their city  ""not without a fight."" Moore allows Manson to share his views, which is something that a lot of people need to do,  just sit down and listen and find out the truth about things before passing judgment. Moore challenges each and everyone one of us to use our freedoms as Americans to try and change the oppressiveness of our country, to stop fearing diversity and to speak up and have a voice. The first step in doing this is to just turn off the television. Stop bombarding our brains with all the negativity, blood shed, and urban legends that is conditioned into us so that we remain living in fear.\nWith this, Moore won a much deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The DVD includes a lot of extras including his feelings on winning the Oscar and about his Oscar speech.\nBowling for Columbine is a very moving documentary that I think as Americans, everyone owes to themselves to experience.";Something has to open our eyes
292;363.0;5.0;7.0;"In his latest film, ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Michael Moore takes us on a journey to try to answer the big question:  ""Why is America so violent?""  Is it the violent movies?  Could it be that we listen to a lot of disturbing music?  Maybe it's because we're too in love with firearms.  Well, as the film goes on, we find out that all of the other countries love violent movies, disturbing music, and guns just as much as we do (even more so, in some cases).  Interesting questions are brought up that offer new points that rarely have been discussed before (like the impact of news programs).  We get more insight into the ""Columbine Massacre,"" and the impact guns can have on a child.  What we get is an interesting ride that is filled with humor and heart.\nAgain, I'm no ""Michael Moore"" cheerleader; as I do not agree with him on everything he's said in the past.  However, I think he does a great job in his documentaries.  I even found ""Bowling for Columbine"" to be better than his first film, ""Roger & Me.""  You're not supposed to take everything that is said here to heart.  That's not what Moore wants at all.  The film's purpose is to bring up some different point of views and give us some very different questions that we have never encountered before.  In the end, it is YOU who decides what is going on and if you believe some of the things that are presented in this movie.\nThe DVD is EXCELLENT when it comes to special features.  This 2-disk Special Edition includes extras like an exclusive interview with Michael Moore, commentary, Marilyn Manson's ""Fight Song"" music video, trailer, photo gallery, ""The Charlie Rose Show,"" and so much more.  The film looks and sounds great, as the budget and quality improved greatly with this one.\n""Bowling for Columbine"" isn't here to offer you solutions.  Nor is it here to make you think the way Michael Moore thinks and feels.  In the end, it is only a movie, and nothing more.  It's up to you to decide if it's going to have an impact on your life in some way or not.  Even if you don't like Moore or agree with the man on every single thing, it is still very much possible to enjoy this film.  This goes down as one of my new favorites.";Bowling with Live Ammo
306;364.0;4.0;7.0;"I just noticed that Time magazine reviewed this movie as ""Hilarious"".  Huh?? What were they thinking???\nThis movie was anything but funny.  Most of this movie, maybe too much, was documenting the tragedies that have faced American society (indeed some were of an international magnitude) in recent years.\nMoore does jump on your emotions, after he has conjured them, to exploit many inconsistencies between public opinion (national policy) and humanitarian efforts.  One may call this political investigation ""Shocking"" or ""Outrageous"", but if you think this is ""Hilarious"", don't consider yourself a friend of the human race.";Not a Comedy
318;365.0;2.0;7.0;"Unfortunately people seem to mistakenly view Michael Moore as an investigative reporter and the products he produces/markets as documentaries.  Nothing could be further from the truth.\nHe embarks on a quest with a closed mind and a definite agenda to portray any given situation in a specific light.  The resulting piece is biased, full of distortion, and contains a large number of out of context statements and events that are portrayed in a manner that best suits the message that Mr. Moore is attempting to transmit.  It is unfortunate that he does not produce a product that clearly examines the issues in an unbiased and open manner.\nMr. Moore's style of ""Reporting"" or ""Journalism"" is quite clearly a throw back to the days of William Randolf Hearst and the the muckraking yellow journalistic style that actually caused our country to wage war on another nation through the distorted presentation of events, conversations and out-right falsehoods as fact.\nView this film as ""entertainment"" not as a documentary.";Lets distort the facts and make Michael some money
322;366.0;1.0;7.0;"I give it 1 star because zero is not an option.  Moore's colection of out of context and out of sync ""quotes"" does a disservice to the idea of a documentary.  He started out with an axe to grind and when the facts did not line up with his preconceptions, he simply made things up.  I do not recommend buying it, but should you actually watch it, just notice how the clips are broken up.  Then notice that the speaker is dressed one way at the beginning, and another after the break.  Pieces are spliced together to portray something that never actually happened.  Actually, Minus 5 would be an appropriate rating.";Best Fiction

329;368.0;2.0;7.0;"Reviewing ""Bowling for Columbine"" is difficult from an objective standpoint, as almost all of the reviews here prove.  They range from praise that some would save for, say, the Dali Lama, to the kind of active hate I usually save for child killers.  The reason is not so much the ""documentary"", but the man who made it: Michael Moore.  Moore is a polarizing figure, he has his ardent followers and he has his angry detractors, and no one in the middle.  One liberal reviewer in the Washington DC City Paper called Moore the man ""who gives Liberal Muckraking a bad name""  So if the review sounds biased, I apologize in advance.\n""Bowling for Columbine"" is a stunningly effective piece of propaganda.  Superbly entertaining, very very funny, and you leave the movie asking yourself some hard questions.  Unfortunately for Moore, some of those questions lead back to the truthfulness of his film.  Getting the gun from the bank-staged.  Footage of Charleton Heston saying ""From my Cold Dead Hand"" at an NRA meeting in Colorado after Coolumbine-actually much older footage of an event that took place on the East Coast.  Footage of the NRA meeting in Flint after a little girl was killed by a classmate-the meeting took place almost a year after it had happened.  Moore edits like crazy to make his targets look insensitive.  He's a master of staging events.\nThe most chilling part of the film is his interview with the ""third bomber"" from Oklahoma City.  Interesting yes, and yes, there are crazy types out there, but what did it have to do with anything?  Moore throws a lot of information at the viewer, possibly in a hope that no one will catch his most glaring errors.  However, thinking about a lot of the film in bits leaves you with the impression that it is much less than the sum of it's parts.  His bizzare questioning of the Lockheed/Martin spokesman in which he asks the man if he thinks that having a missle factory in the backyard caused Columbine.  Of course, that plant manufactures rockets that send satellites into space, but that doesn't matter to Moore.  He mentions the bombing of Kosovo as another possible motive for the attacks.  While this makes no sense, it feeds into Moore's thesis: that we are frightened nation of Gun Nuts.  The highly insulting cartoon(which, by the way folks, was NOT produced by the South Park Duo)equates owning a gun with hating African-Americans and supporting the KKK.  No real connection is made, but the fact that Moore says it exists is enough for his fans, who always said as much in private and are overjoyed that a narcissitic egomaniac who shares their views said it.\nThere are a couple of very good segments.  The first is when he talks with South Park co-creator Matt Stone, who makes some very valid points about the kind of verbal abuse many teens deal with in High School.  In fact, better documentaries have been made about that very subject.  Moore doesn't follow through, too content to blame the Government for everything.  The second point, which I actually heartily agree with, is that the media hypes violence.  Moore walks through South Central LA with a sociologist and they talk about how even though violent crime has been dropping in this country, the number of news stories covering murders has increased exponentially.  If it bleeds, it leads.  If the film were less sensationalistic, more thoughtful commentary like this would make it in, instead of wild claims that try to link the Vietnam War to Columbine.\nIn the end, the reason the film will probably be seen as a failure in the future is that it is all really about Moore.  He is a self-promoter in the finest tradition of PT Barnum(I mean that as a compliment)  From his self-serving endorsement of Ralph Nader in 2000 to his infamous Oscar speech and his plans to make a documantary blaming the entire Bush family for every crime ever committed against humanity, Moore is best at promoting himself.  Countless people in the film have since come out saying they felt used by Moore, from Lockheed Martin to one of the Columbine survivors Moore took to K-Mart to get than to stop selling ammo.  Moore will use any tragedy to advance his own cause-himself.  He is, in the end, a charlatan and elitist posing as an everyman.  His film cannot be judged without the correct view of the man who made it.  You can dislike Moore and agree with his views, but I've found very few who do.  Liberal or conservative.  Thoughtful conservatives(those who did the actual research that dispels much of his ""proof"" find Moore's trashing of them insulting, and thoughful, concerned liberals, while sypathetic to some of his causes, would rather have someone willing to debate with facts and reality than the strange, upside-down stuff Moore comes up with.  His film is not ""truth"" in any sense of the word.  If you think I'm insane, check out no-spin websites that are truly nonpartisan that have the same problem.  Check out LIBERAL sites that call him and his motives into question.  But in the end, do what Moore wants you to do with the rest of the world to him: look deeper, and see the rotten Underbelly and black heart at the heart of this ""fictitious"" documentary.";Entertaining & Funny, Yes, But is is True?
391;369.0;5.0;7.0;I never seen a movie that so articulately expressed some of the most pointless, terrible problems facing America today.  I found it hysterically ironic that Marilyn Manson turned out to be the most well-spoken person Moore talked to throughout the course of the film, making Charleston Heston look feeble and racist.  The most eloquent part of the film, I think, is when K-Mart agrees to ban the sale of amunition in all their stores.  The looks on those two men's faces were uplifting and sad at the same time, because you know what price bought their victory.  The animated history of the KKK and the NRA provokes thoughtful laughter, which is the best kind sometimes.  I've also never seen anything that so deeply inspired the desire within me to move to Canada.;Guns N' Moses loses face to Marilyn Manson!

I took over a dozen of my friends to see this movie even though the movie theaters charge more to see it than I make at two hours of work. Don't get me wrong it was worth every penny when I saw the look on my friends faces after Mr. Moore's facts and interviews. It was was almost calming to now know that my friends who were somewhat in the dark before seeing the film, that they now have an understanding that our country is not the land of perpetual bliss as it is always described as. So for all you who would like to know the truth and understand our problems and infatuation with guns and violence this is a good start, but definitly not the finish.

They showed it again last night.\n\nI have to say here that, prior to this, I'd never seen anything of Michael Moore's (except for one episode of ""TV Nation"") and had never had an interest in seeing any of his films because of all of the negative things I'd heard, including things Moore fans had raved about that I thought were negative, such as the way Moore confronts people in his films.\n\nWhat surprised me about ""Bowling for Columbine"" was what came across to me as Michael Moore's compassion. I really got the sense that he cared very deeply about people who lost their lives through gun violence as well as about people who lived in unfortunate circumstances. I have much greater respect for him than I had before I saw the film. His motivating factor doesn't seem to me to be so much political as moral. He truly is a moralist. He reminds me of the abolitionists of the nineteenth century that way. (Who an awful lot of people found annoying, if I need remind anyone.) For him, I don't think it's so much ""Corporations and other powerful entities are evil"" as ""People not caring about other people--especially people not caring for those who are less fortunate--results in separation and hostility between people, which leads to evil."" Well, shoot, they preach that in my church every Sunday. And, last time I checked, we weren't socialists.\n\nAlso: I had heard, even from Moore fans, that his interview with Charlton Heston was unfortunate and embarrasing. But I don't agree. Why shouldn't he have asked Heston why he did what he did? Why on earth would Heston have gone to Denver and Flint after what happened? I just don't understand it. Some people said Heston was obviously suffering from Alzheimer's and incapable of carrying on the interview. He seemed entirely lucid to me. He was lucid enough to get up and walk away because he didn't want to answer the questions.\n\nThank you, Michael Moore, for leaving Kayla Rolland's photo behind. Maybe Charlton Heston took it inside. Maybe it made some kind of difference.\n\nPeace";Changed My Perceptions of Michael Moore
482;376.0;4.0;7.0;"Charlton Heston went to court in a futile attempt to keep director Michael Moore from including footage of an ""ambush"" interview in ""Bowling For Columbine.""  Moore is the scruffy self-styled populist writer with bad hair under a permanent Detroit Tigers baseball cap. During the interview, Heston becomes so unhinged that he walks away, leaving Moore and his bewildered camera crew sitting in the pool house the Heston estate. Moses has left the building ...and it turns out the that the avuncular chairman of the NRA is an inarticulate old coot without his teleprompter. It is moments like this that make ""Bowling For Columbine"" compelling viewing.\nMoore takes his agit-prop artistry straight from Saul Alinsky's ""Rules for Radicals"". Alinsky, the notorious grass roots organizer from the Back of the Yards neighborhood of Chicago, advises radicals to personalize their political targets and embarass them into submission. Moore may look like he just fell off a barstool in a Flint Michigan honky tonk, but he is a articulate street fighter in this exploration of the root cause of violence in America. Moore wisely chooses not to argue with the gun toting members of the Michigan militia. Instead, Moore uses the guise of a ""puff interview"" to allow militia members to reveal their lunacy in ungaurded moments. Moore stumbles a bit in his analysis, attributing violence in American culture to nervous white people who buy guns to fend off scary minorities... but even as he shoots from the hip, Moore seldom misses his target.";Political Agitation As Art
486;377.0;5.0;7.0;"I can be just as annoyed with Michael Moore as the next fellow--and not just because his name is similar to mine and he looks a little like me. He is far from immune to the common charges flung at him: manipulator, grandstander, camera hog, knee-jerk radical. Yet all of these accusations become irrelevant when he has a subject equal to his outrage and his caustic wit. ""Bowling for Columbine,"" an impassioned plea for gun control, may well be his finest, most outraged movie yet. Juxtaposing stock footage with modern-day interviews and running commentary, he roils the audience with shocked laughter, then plain old shock, and finally shocked mourning. Moore's great theme is the bottomless capacity of human beings to be both stupid and cruel, and in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he uncovers abundant stupidity and cruelty. Worthies such as James Nichols (brother of Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols) hang themselves with their own rhapsodic paeans to their love of guns and fear of their fellow man. Moore has an incredible ability to get militia men, drug dealers, bomb throwers and their ilk to confess to their crimes on camera, as if they were talking about their day at the zoo. For Michael Moore, it's always a day at the zoo, and at the end of the movie he stalks particularly big game in the person of Charlton Heston, erstwhile superstar and current NRA president. As Moore grills Heston about the NRA's decision to hold a rally in Flint, Mich., just days after the shooting in Flint of six-year-old Kayla Rolland by her first-grade classmate, he deftly strips away Heston's brave facade to show the hollow man underneath. The Heston interview brings ""Bowling for Columbine"" to a particularly mournful close, as the audience--like Moore--is left wondering when the madness finally will stop. Not any time soon, unfortunately.";Laughing all the way to the graveyard.
42;378.0;5.0;6.0;"This film made some excellent points about guns and violence in America.  I loved the scene where the Lockheed-Martin representative is talking about Columbine and how we need to reduce violence--while standing in front of a Lockheed missile.  I also liked the scene where a seemingly ordinary teenage boy wearing a loose-fitting shirt turns out to be a walking arsenal, with dozens of guns concealed in his pants.  My husband and I were practically rolling on the floor laughing at that one.\n\nSeriously, though, Moore brings across very well how much better our quality of life in the U.S. could be if we rethought our love affair with guns.  Canada has strict laws about registration of guns and the like, and their quality of life is no worse than ours.  What would be so terrible about making sure that lunatics and criminals can't buy guns, and seeing to it that guns used in crimes can be traced?  Although Moore doesn't mention this, I think that gun owners and manufacturers should also be required to pay into a fund that hospitals would use for the enormous health care costs caused by guns.  Gun owners and makers should also pay the cost of the extra policing that guns make necessary.\n\nMoore does tend to fall off the liberal deep end at times.  He makes a big deal of the fact that the mother of the 6-year-old who shot his classmate was in a welfare-to-work program, working two jobs, and had no time to supervise her son.  While this is sad, in my opinion Moore is barking up the wrong tree by blaming welfare-to-work.  The first thing to ask is why a woman with no skills and no husband chose to have a son.  Did her church tell her it was a sin to get an abortion?  If so, it should be her church who supports the two of them, not the taxpayers.\n\nAnother question Moore fails to understand is that it's rather odd that this woman works full time but can't afford to pay rent.  I think more welfare is not the answer here.  The sad fact is that no one has ever figured out a way to spend money to relieve poverty without creating dependency; no matter what you do, you end up with a problem worse than the one you started with.  To find the right answer, you need to ask why housing costs are so high in the U.S., and why there is so little low-cost housing near jobs.  After all, the salary this mother was making at the mall would have put her into the middle class in most countries, and the cost of building materials is simply not that different between countries.  Surprisingly, a big part of the answer as I see it is bad zoning and parking laws and overly restrictive building codes in most U.S. cities.  These laws make it difficult and expensive to build housing here, and the housing that does get built is spread out widely, so that it's hard to get around without a car.  For more on this, see Kunstler's book ""The Geography of Nowhere"" and Shoup's ""The High Cost of Free Parking.""\n\nOverall, though, the movie is consistently entertaining.  Watch it even if you don't agree.";Entertaining and thought-provoking

81;385.0;4.0;6.0;"Produced, written and directed by the inimitable Michael Moore, Bowling For Columbine examines how domestic fears have increased America's obsession with guns and scrutinizes the tragedies that have befallen countless individuals in this country as the result of that obsession. Moore's bravado and showmanship always brings high entertainment value to all of his documentaries, and it is always a pleasure to see him exposing the spinelessness or hypocrisy of some political pawn or coporate underling. It is unfortunate to reflect that despite the noble intentions of the filmmaker, Bowling for Columbine rarely offers definitive answers to the social issues it discusses and often recklessly and foolishly correlates American violence with everything from our nation's foreign policy to killer bees. Nevertheless, the film is undeniably provocative, and never fails to directly confront the forces it opposes. Among the highlights of the movie: a hard hitting interview with NRA president Charlton Heston (in which the Oscar winning actor appears too befuddled and insensitive to effectively discuss the ideals of his organization), an interview with the producer of the television show COPS (who shows no compunction for fostering fear and loathing of minorities because ""violence sells,"") and an encounter with Oklahoma City bombing suspect James Nichols (who encourages people to own guns, but believes that the personal ownership of nuclear weapons should be illegal because ""there are some real sickos out there"").

82;386.0;5.0;6.0;In Bowling for Columbine, the charming, witty, interesting and at times laugh out loud funny documentary, film maker Michael Moore tackles a tough subject in the world today: Gun Control. As a member of the NRA, Moore does not in any way disapprove of gun-ownership. What Moore does disapprove of is the assualt rifles and high powered pistols that are essentially designed for the killing of not deer, but human beings. Moore asks a question many polititians are afraid to ask: Why are there over ten thousand deaths caused by intentional misuse of guns in the United States, but in Canada, a gun-crazy country, there are less than 100 deaths a year caused by guns? Moore asks Canadians, American citizens, even the leader of the NRA why this is. And by watching this incredible documentary, you will find the answer;One of the BEST documentaries I have ever seen

93;388.0;4.0;6.0;"You can't deny that ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a powerfully done documentary. While everyone has now turned their attention to the controversially loved Fahrenheit 9/11, ""Bowling for Columbine"" is still a worthwhile film by Michael Moore.\n\n In this film Michael Moore looks at gun control and violence in America and how obsessed with it we are and just how the Media does their job. This documentary is NOT saying that if we had better gun control Columbine wouldn't have happened. Don't get the wrong idea. The film merely examines gun control, the film also is not a one-sided job. In fact, Michael Moore himsel is a membe of he NRA.\n\n What is nice about this documentary is that unlike Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael Moore doesn't have the answer he's trying to find it. In FH9/11 Michael Moore seems to know everything, but in ""Bowling for Columbine"" he's constantly running around trying to find an answer to the problem rather than presenting us with one. Amazingly enough this works. The documentary soon isn't another factoid but rather an editorial of American culture.\n\n The film has several powerful points that will stand out in your mind (such as when Moore goes to the K-Mart headquarters with two children shot at Columbine to ""return the merchandise"").\n\n The problem with the film however is simply that many points it seems as if Moore is talking just to hear himself preach. That and once again we're taken to Flint Michigan. Well, there's nothing wrong with going to Flint, Michigan but Moore is ALWAYS taking us to his hometown. I've nothing against Flint but I'm getting tired of seeing it in every documentary Moore comes up with.\n\n Ultimately this is a good movie to watch. It really goes when examing gun control in our culture. But the film isn't saying ""If we had bette Gun Control, Columbine wouldn't have happened."" The film is ASKING ""IF we had better gun control, could Columbine have been prevented?""\n\n Don't get the wrong idea.";A Powerful Documentary but the thoughts are too distorted.
106;389.0;5.0;6.0;The people who are writing all these reviews need to stop looking at Michael Moore and start looking at themselves. It doesnt matter if your a democrat, republican, liberal, blah blah blah, the fact still remains that we Americans are a violent gun-toting race of people. Calling him a commie and a trater doesnt make any sense to me because whatever he says about America is real. He offers different ways to look at things. You can support your country without supporting war and guns. America has great potential but we are destroying ourselves worse than any terrorist can. The interview w/ Marilyn Manson was a highlight because it showed a caring intellectual side to him that most people didn't know he had. This is an important film that one should watch and not be so quick to pass judgement. And if your going to boycott something don't boycott Michael Moore, boycott Texas instead.;Think outside the box
107;390.0;2.0;6.0;"So many people are tied up in the politics of Michael Moore, they fail to realize that documentary is an art form.  It is an artistic means through which to examine a thesis.  I like Moore's work in general, but find the ""Columbine"" film to be sorely lacking in clarity.  In a nutshell, the film's thesis (assuming it has one) is kind of ""wishy-washy"".  I watched the film once and kept waiting for Mike to ""get to the point"" and found that his gift for sardonically presenting bitter ironies and ""slapping viewers awake"" was wasted on subject matter that is perhaps best left in the perview of Criminologists.  Then, to see if it had any redeeming educational value, I watched it again and drew the same conclusion about the movie.  I was very disappointed.\nAs I said, I like Moore and I will gladly rethink this review if someone can prove me wrong by telling me in a sentence or two, what *exactly* the thesis is.  Is it a statement on the state of youth of America?  Is it a statement about spoiled rich kids who kill their classmates?  Is it a statement about parents, the educational system...gun control...what...why?  Who is to blame for the terrible events in Columbine?  Alas, the film raises tons of questions, but answers none.\nWhile many people have criticized the film for pushing a political agenda related to gun control, this is perhaps Moore's most objective documentary.  People who see an ""anti-gun agenda"" in this film are just seeing what they want to see based on thier emotions about Moore.\nWhile watching Columbine, I actually got the feeling that Moore himself was uncomfortable with the grayness of the subject matter.  It's almost as if Moore was aware that a strong pro-gun control argument would put him at odds with the constitutional freedoms that he has spent the better moments of his career defending.  As a result, the film tends to branch out into too many areas (such as Militia groups, popular music, popular cultural notions about guns, etc.) leaving the viewer with a general impression that yes, we do live in a ""Gun Culture"" - but knowing this fact may or may not provide any adequate solution to the next Columbine.\nThe result of the muddled thesis, however, might have given  Moore the appearance of ""neutrality"" that I suppose it takes to win an Oscar.  Or perhaps that was Hollywood's indirect way of acknowledging that he had deserved credit for earlier (and much better) work.  No matter, fans of Mike will acknowledge that he is better as a documentarian when his work puts him at odds with big corporations and big government.  He should stay away from the ""garden-variety"" crime issue.\nPerhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film is it's break away from the traditional ""Moore style"" which is laced with genuine humor and clever camera-work.  There are a few chuckles when Moore opens an savings account at a Northern Michigan bank and gets a ""free shotgun"" for his patronage, but the film is otherwise humorless.  The camera-work in the film is as sophmoric as any piece on 60 minutes.  Contrast this to Mike's quick-cut camerawork and shocking transitions in Roger and Me!\nWith regard to Moore's the issue of content, the movie doesn't fare to well either with Mike bouncing footage around from Militia groups to interviews with celebs, and so on.  There seems to be no linearity in his presentation whatsoever.\nMoore is definitely out of form on this one.  I would however, give him two stars.  One for a valiant effort to root out the etiology of the Columbine incident. And another for showing enough refrain so as not to make any sweepingly bold and overpowering statements in the foggy area of gun control, in spite of the way in which many people seem to have interpreted Bowling for Columbine.";Not Moore's finest hour
111;391.0;5.0;6.0;"BFC is probably the most important documentary about American mentality ever made. What Mike points out, in among all his questions, is that a population in this much fear SHOULD NOT HAVE SO MANY GUNS LYING AROUND nor should it be so dependent on a Military Industrial Complex that creates that fear. This is never as clear as to when you get a quick history of the USA abroad which shows this military industrial complex in action, including CIA funding for the mujahideen soldiers in Afghanistan, to fight the Soviets, only to end up a few years later with the Mujahideen turning into the Taliban and Al-Qaeda which finishes with a shot of the second jet smashing into the twin towers. Mike is an extremely powerful filmmaker, there is no doubt about that.\n\nHe cuts history together amazingly - the historical film montages, of which there are several in this documentary, are mostly just news images cut together letting you make up your own mind - can anyone here agree with these acts of mass genocide?\nHaving spent time working as a media editor I can say that the BFC is cut no more than other primetime television news shows (some critics have created great big EDL lists of what Mike has edited which shows they do not understand the process of media production nor that this is indeed probably more tight than most other documentaries - National Geographic is mostly STORYBORDED and the top American news channels are mostly biased). If you want to see a documentary that is truly manipulated and cut to ribbons then why not watch some old CNN/FOX NEWS 1991 Iraq war news stories (or even the current ones!) or tune into some commission hearing and you will see how the politicians and military leaders can manage to excuse themselves for all kinds of horror shows. AND THEY ARE!\n\nBFC starts with Mike in a bank, opening up an account and then getting his free riffle with it while asking the question ""Do you not think it is a little dangerous giving out guns in a bank?"" which sets the whole tone for what is to come. Mike takes us to Militia meetings where we see civilians with big assault weapons training in the open to learn how to protect their family, but then he shows us the other side of militia groups with the likes of McVay and Nichols and the Oklahoma bombing (Mike shows us an amazing interview he has with the brother of Nichols who cocks a loaded gun to his head). Then it is off to Oscoda where young dropouts are interviewed and tell us the tale about their violent past and what they know about the Columbine School Massacre to set the scene. Then we go visit Littleton's Lockheed Martin, the worlds largest weapons manufacturer. The real prime moment of this documentary follows, with security video tapes and the police audio of what happened in Columbine (you see Eric and Dylan taking shots at people and trying to burn down the school). As soon as this is over Mike hits controversy by showing the leader of the National Riffle Association, Charlton Heston, holding a massive rally just after the Columbine shooting. The editing here is blowing so many rightwing minds because it is just so DAMN WELL DONE.\nMike then gives us statistics on gun deaths and asks the question -why is it that if other countries have the same amount of gun ownership we do, the same amount of violent movies that we do, play the same video games that we do, have just a violent pass (if not more so) that we do - that they kill 90% less people with guns that we do?\nMike shows us that the American news media is in a fear feeding frenzy. Shows about FEAR sell. Other nations simply do not have so much FEAR being dished out in the news. Mike believes, correctly, that mass conditioning of FEAR has lead to this American suicidal/homicidal nature and so he does a great interview in South-Central LA with the writer of ""The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things"", Barry Glassner. Eventually Mike ends up in the office of the producer of COPS to ask if they can do anything to tone down the fear - especially fear of ethnic minorities and for some reason you can see that the producer of this show knows damn well how it is distressing people. Mike suggests chasing down corporate crooks instead (he did this during his show TV NATION).\nMike finishes the documentary by visiting Canada to do an analysis of why they don't have as many gun deaths. Then we learn about Kayla Rolland who was shot by another 6 year old in her class in Mike's home of Michigan. Mike discovers that the mother of the young shooter had been recently evicted and was working away from home because of the government sponsored - Welfare to Work program that sends single black parents, 30km out of town everyday to earn $5.50 an hour. The NRA and Mr. Heston turned up in town shortly after this shooting.\n\nSo Mike is fed up with all of this ""NEEDLESS DEATH"" and heads down to Kmart with a bunch of kids that where shot up with Kmart handgun bullets during the Columbine massacre and asks Kmart to stop stocking these bullets. After this success Mike decides to visit Charlton Heston to ask him why he just turns up at NRA events after a kid has been murdered by a gun, again. He then asks him why there is so much violence in America. When you realize that Charlton has no clue and his answer is - ""It's because of mixed ethnicity"", then it all sinks in home that you have learned more today than this confused old man who represents a disturbing stupid mentality among SOME Americans than is leading to death and destruction, period.";Best Documentary about Stopping Senseless World Death

Hey conservatives! WATCH THE FILM!! I know it's the conservative mantra to condemn something they haven't viewed because (1) One of the conservative legends in their own minds like Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh told them what to think (as usual) or (2) Anything Michael Moore has to be, in their ""fair and balanced"" opinion, slanted, anti-American communist garbage.\nSome conservatives have accused Moore of exploiting Heston's Alzheimer condition. News flash, GOPer's! The interview was conducted before Heston revealed he had Alzheimer's disease. Unless Moore is paying off Heston's doctor to give him his medical history, there was no way he could have known about Heston's condition. The damaging quote from Heston is that America's racial diversity is at the root of all the gun violence in America. Moore did not manipulate Heston into saying that. He merely asked Heston, as spokesman of the NRA, what causes all the gun violence in America. Charlton Heston was the spokesman for the National Rifle Association. If he can't handle a simple question from Michael Moore without blaming racial diversity and essentially sticking his foot in his mouth, maybe the NRA should be looking for new leadership instead of calling a completely fair question from Michael Moore dirty pool.\nRight wingers love to wrap themselves in the flag and call someone that disagrees with them un-American. I believe strongly in the right to bear arms and keep guns in responsible households for self-protection, but the NRA is yet another right wing fringe nut group that hides behind the 2nd Amendment in order to forward their extremist policies. This, remember, is the organization that claimed that teflon coated ""cop killer"" bullets were a right and that porcelain guns that could be smuggled through metal detectors were protected under the 2nd Amendment (imagine how much more horrific the events of 9/11/01 might have been had our friends at the NRA had their way). Anyone who actually thinks that Michael Moore was being unfair to Charlton Heston in his interview just can't accept the fact that Heston leads a extremist group that can't possibly defend it's policy goals. Once again, the right wing whines about being picked upon when they really richly deserve every bit of criticism they've received. Casting Michael Moore as the devil will never excuse the dangerous, irresponsible and racist beliefs of Charlton Heston and the organization he represented.";Poor Charlton Heston, My Foot!

144;397.0;4.0;6.0;"I wanted to review this movie after reading a website that indicates that MM hates America.  After viewing this documentary, I don't agree with that assessment about Michael, however, the movie has left a lot unresolved for this viewer.\nMichael Moore is someone who can create a mood that is clear, somewhat one sided and can really get to the viewer, however, what was his point here?\nHe takes a rather wide swipe at America as a whole using two shootings that just happen to have an NRA meeting on the heals of them, one of course in Columbine High, and the other in his hometown of Flint Michigan.  The irony here is devastingly clear.\nMichael takes on people from every side in this video, the NRA headed up by Charlton Heston, the military industrial complex, the media, Clinton for his role in the bombings in Kosovo, Bush post 9-11 and a large budget for the war machine, Kerry is viewed quickly.  So, although mostly seeming to blame the current administration, he finds fault with the American system as a major culprit.\nYet, what is he asking us to do?  The reason I rated this a ""4"" was the impact that it had on me, especially but for the view that we are a society that is living in fear.  We hear about things all day long that make us afraid, and his vignettes regarding fear are well put together to get the viewer to acknowledge we are taught to fear.\nHowever, Michael takes on a somewhat cordial man who invites him into his home, Heston, and seems to ambush him during his interview.  He weaves together pictures making it seem that Heston is referring to a quote, ....from my cold dead hands.... that you may think was voiced immediately after Columbine in the NRA, apparently national conference, obviously scheduled months prior to the massacre.  That quote and very brief video clip is from some time later.  The remainder of the clip is from the Heston speech in Denver.  (to get a great view of the whole text of Hestons speech go to Michael's website, yet you may want to peruse the web also.)\nHis story about Flint though is very touching indeed and we all need to take notice that we need to solve our national problems and quickly.  He shows how the welfare to work program has further hurt those that it was supposed to free from welfare.  He does not do so objectively though and we are given the perspective that the current administration was the one who came up with that.....although not expressed, you get that feel.\nMichael would have hit his mark in this film like he did in Roger and Me if he would have tackled things much more objectively.  He goes after the person whose name is on the restaurant of an employee involved in the movie.....there are implications that he is responsible for her situation.  What is he wanting that man to do?  We never know and we are left wondering what Michael's intent is in tracking him down.\nIf I had the chance to ask MM some things I would want to know what he is doing as an American, who has made millions by selling his very interesting material, what is he doing for Flint, for the high school in the video with facilities that are lacking?  I mean I do not expect him to flaunt what he does, but is he helping in any way to assist the needy?\nI feel Michael does his part in pointing out things in our society that should create concern and motivate us to change.  Yet what is he wanting us to do now that he has informed us?";Strong Message with no particular Solution Offered
153;398.0;3.0;6.0;"But there are problems.\nMichael Moore is astonishingly fat. The man is fat. That alone calls his credibility into judgment. How can I take a man seriously who cannot control his own carbohydrate intake, really? And can you trust him? He could be hiding anything in those greasy rolls of fat. A hacksaw, a machete, even a AK-47. He could slide it out and take any one of us down at any time. And why? Perhaps we unwittingly stood between him and the last Krispy Kreme doughnut. What a pity. No one's life deserves to end on the business end of an AK-47 while pudgy hands grasp greedily for overly sugared confections. That is why he makes a good point about gun control. We should work to keep guns out of the hands of children and fat man. One time this dude who looked frighteningly like Dom DeLuise walked into Outback Steakhouse in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin with a Glock and started screaming ""Give me all your pork ribs and no one gets hurt!"" It's because the guy's barbeque sauce blood ratio became low and the man became disoriented and confused. The cops slapped the cuffs on him while he was finishing off a side of steak fries, and the man claimed he didn't remember anything after his wife told him they were having Chicken Caesar Salad for dinner.\nMy point is, gun control is good if it will keep guns out of the hands of crazy fat men like Michael Moore. Just think of the late Chris Farley. Would you trust him with a gun? No way. But he deftly sidesteps the issue of whether fatties should have guns.\nIn this way, I think he does a disservice to his project, and I can only give this work 3 stars.";This has some good elements, which I will explain below.
165;399.0;5.0;6.0;im not aggressively opinionated, or even old enough to vote, but i loved this movie.  it was devastating and humourous and ingenuis.;im not much for politics
171;400.0;5.0;6.0;This is a really incredible documentary that sheds light onto the issue of America's obsession with guns, firearms, and it's obsession with violent material like what we've seen in video games and movies in the past decade.\n Some of the facts that this documentary explains are really quite sad but are very true as well.\n Such a fact was the incident in Flint, Michigan where a 6 year old kid actually shot another 6 year old classmate to death with a firearm that he had acquire from an uncle days before then. I was very heartbroken at the news of that and this documentary goes a lot deeper into the possible cause which is obvious, poverty and guns! Even worse is that the mother of the kid actually worked at a fancy Dick Clark restaurant and also at another place to try to make ends meet and was still in danger of losing her home.\n Dick Clark is just a greedy egotist who cares nothing for the poorer workers who work for his business! Pretty sick!\n There's more on here that should be watched as well such as where it focuses on the Columbine shootings but I felt compelled to write on the Flint, Michigan shooting thing as I lived in Flint around the time the shooting happened.\n Michael Moore is a true hero in our society and nothing is more valuable than the truth and Moore aims to expose the truth!;So sad but very true
190;401.0;5.0;6.0;Ever notice how conservatives (especially gun nuts) tend to call people names rather than concentrate on the facts?  All you have to do is call someone a liberal, and you completely discredit everything that person has said, right?  I mean, come on.  A good number of these people who have written negative reviews attacking Michael Moore can't even SPELL!!  I don't expect everybody to agree with what Michael Moore has done here.  A good portion of you have been poisoned with misinformation and bias by Faux News, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh.  It is understandable that you critique Michael's work with slightly askew perception.  You have been trained that way.  It's not entirely your fault.  But there IS something you can do about it.  Read more, listen to more BBC, and draw your own conclusions.  Don't let Dubya connect the dots for you.  This movie gives no answers, but rather raises a lot of questions.  It asks YOU to draw the conclusion.  Brilliantly compiled, and shown from a fine perspective.  Michael Moore is a genius.;YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!!
198;402.0;3.0;6.0;Moore brings up some good points and brings to the surface somethings we may forget, for example, the insanely high rate of homicides in the United States when compared to other nations and the like.  But a lot of the information that Moore presents is extremely simplified and not completely accurate.  This is frurstrating especially when you reach the end of the movie and realize that there is no real point other than to point out that the United States has a lot of violence, but no questions are answered, only more questions made, and some of these are extremely pointless and should not even have time devoted to them.;Good points, too much simplicity
216;403.0;2.0;6.0;"In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across as it should do in making people aware of the high crime rate in the USA and the fact that this is in great part due to all the weapons that are out there. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.\nLying about being a member of the NRA to get an appointment in order to play ""tricks"" on Charlton Heston in an attempt to humiliate one of America's best actors is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a ""noble cause"".\nA more balanced and objective approach with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one.";Lack of balance leads to lack of credibility.
223;404.0;5.0;6.0;this is one amazing movie. i saw an Oprah episode on it a few months back and couldn't wait until it came out on dvd. it took some convincing for my parents to let me see it (im only 13) but because of my maturity they allowed me to see it. i couldn't touch the remote to pause it, even when i had to seriously go to the bathroom. it took me 3 viewings to take in all of the information that was thrown at me but eventually i was amazed by how disgusting our country is. disregard what michael moore said at the oscars (depite the fact that he was right) and pick up this movie. take this into consideration. Number of gun deaths per year per country:Germany:381 France:255 Canada:165 UK:68 Austrailia:65 Japan:39 and the US:11127. a bit shocking, right? also, charlton heston had the nerve to vist littleton the month after the columbine shooting, and visted flint the week after the youngest school shooing of a 6 year old to hold pro gun rallies. he was speechless when moore asked him why he chose those places at those difficult times. moore left a picture of the slain girl, Kayla Rollands, at hestons door. this movie should not be missed. it had me debating with my friends of gun control at 8th grade lunch and protesting the use of toy guns on an elementary school playground. it will completely change the way you think;Couldnt take my eyes off of the screen
226;405.0;3.0;6.0;"As a fairly liberal person, but also a reasoning one, I have to say that I agree with some previous reviewers who state that this movie is high on style and light on facts. Moore makes a number of great points in this movie, and then fails to exploit them, opting instead for sure-fire propaganda such as the climactic and uncomfortable interview of Charlton Heston.\nThe most glaring example of this happens a good way into the movie, when Moore is focusing on Canada, and their higher per-capita gun ownership, in comparison to the US. There is a moment where we see a shot of a Canadian news anchor on a television in a bar, dryly reporting dry news. Moore mentions something about the very civilized Canadian news coverage, a stark contrast to US-style, ""If it bleeds it leads"" reporting.\nOnce he's done pointing out this contrast, Moore spends the rest of the picture ignoring the media's role in the subject he's purportedly trying to get to the bottom of. Is there NO ONE who sees the importance of the media to the public attitude? It's almost as if Moore longs to be a ""credible journalist"" himself, and doesn't want to upset anyone in a position to hand it to him. If this movie really wanted to create some answers instead of more questions, it should have been pointed squarely at the mainstream media. Could the influence of 24-hour-a-day war, crime, sex scandal and the resulting drone of pundit ""analysis"" have ANYTHING to do with the darkening of the US ""Group Mind""? Only a tiny little bit in Moore's world, it seems.\nI think this movie is best viewed not as a documentary OR a propaganda piece, but instead as sort of left-slanted comedy. I don't for one moment want to give the impression that I hated this movie...as I said, I'm pretty liberal, and it produced plenty of belly laughs, while making some great points about the state of our society. But to be so, so close to seeing the keelhauling of the national media, and then to have it slip away, is frankly painful.\nBlind, following, unbending liberals, click away at that little ""no"" button below. Being the polar opposite of Bill O'Reilly doesn't make you any better than him.";Was this review REALLY unhelpful to you?
230;406.0;5.0;6.0;Michael Moore asks some serious questions.  Why does the United States have so many murders compared to other westernized, modern and developed countries?  Those countries don't have the poverty we do, they don't watch or play or listen to the violence we enjoy or other reasons shelved out to respond to the epidemic of gun violence in this country.  Moore takes all those arguements and effectively contradicts them with well-thought out counter-arguements.  He focuses on two infamous acts of gun violence: the Columbine shootings and the shooting of a six year-old girl by a class-mate that occurred in Flint, Michigan as examples.  It is extremely easy to get the guns used in these shootings and even easier to buy the ammo, Moore points out.  At K-Mart, one can buy ammo at any age with no i.d.  But the film does not focus the bulk of its time on Moores' inheritantly liberal standings (the film features a scathing cartoon that satires the history of white people in America, and Moore unfortunatly skewers a couple facts for more liberal effect), but far more on the issue at hand.  The Columbine shooting was done by two boys who played violent video games, listen to violence ridden music and watched violent t.v. and movies.  But Moore points out that many other developed countries watch the same movies, listen to the same music and play the same video games.  Japan, the global epicenter of violent video games has less than one hundred murders a year.  Many European countries watch the same movies and listen to the same music we do, but their combine murder rate for a year is serveral thousands less than America.  The Flint shooting was done by and African-American child.  But people of African heritage live all around the world.  Canada has the same percentage of African- American population that we do, but their murder rate is no more than a hundred a year.  So why does America have so many more murders that the rest of the developed, modern world (somewhere around an alarming 11,000, 11,000 a year)?  Without giving away too much, Moore hypothesises that the reasons are socital and the media.  We have always been brought up with you have the right to own a gun and that you have the right to use it .  Also, look at the news the next time you see it...how much time is spent on covering the negative side of human nature and crime.  It may surprise you.  It obviously did that to Moore.;When It Comes to Gun Control...
231;407.0;5.0;6.0;"The film provides a lot of essential information and interesting insight into the American culture and social system. I think it is most important for European viewers like me that the film makes us think about our own social systems and the path our countries have taken recently. It can be seen as a warning and stimulation for our peoples to rethink these recent changes and the increasing  ""Americanization"" , especially as far as economic and social aggravations are concerned.\nI am a high school teacher and watch the film with all of my students. They love the film too. It is great to have such an authentic documentary about many differences between Europe and the US.";Great documentary, also for Europeans
242;408.0;3.0;6.0;"This film was a fantastic expose on the sort of domestic problems within the United States placed on a level that the average person can understand. Michael Moore, surprisingly, does not merely address gun control. For example, he touches on the endemic problem in America concerning the African American underclass and what is and is not being done to remedy the situation.\nHowever, he spoils his work by inappropriately, (sometimes inaccurately ie/Bosnia) discussing international affairs. Moore seems to believe that bad moves by the U.S. government corrolate with the domestic issue of gun control. He wags his finger at overseas military action, that is not always unwarranted, as if it is the reason that the Columbine shootings occured. Simply because the U.S. military has guns and has the tendency to act aggressively overseas does not mean that is why an American civilian will buy a gun and start schooling (Lee Harvey Oswald being an obvious exception). The Canadian military has firearms too and has been involved in nearly every conflict the United States has been involved in for the last century excluding the Vietnam war and the recent war on Iraq. This was a poor attempt by Moore to put his views on American foreign policy in this film that should have rightly stayed on U.S. soil.\n""Bowling for Columbine"" gets minus one star for the shameless plug of international views and minus one point for inaccuracies and misleading statements on that point.";A great film about domestic problems...but...
251;409.0;2.0;6.0;"Hmm...when I first saw this I was excited because I thought Roger and Me (1989) was one of the most thought provoking documentaries I had ever seen. When I came out from the theater with my friends, they were talking about how brilliant it was. Being 18, and raised in a very liberal environment in the Boston suburbs, I was agreeing with them for the longest time, but then I watched it a second time with new information and realized that while making its point (to me anyway, WAY too many people writing here certainly missed it...), there was something bothering me.\nYou have to admit that Moore is good at what he does. He always does an excellent job of setting up his scenes and shots. Whether you agree with his opinions or not, his view, as portrayed by the camera, does a great job of seizing you. He does prey on the unwittingness of others, and i'm sure that Moore would not want to be the victim of his own tactics. But sound splicing and video editing? Moore what is this? Its false advertising, that's what it is. This movie is a semi-documentary, if that...that's what bothers me about this movie.\nThe cartoon (with NRA and KKK, and such) I thought was a over the top. While being very funny (clearly the brain child of the creators of South Park), many of the facts are distorted. Yet other scenes such as with Nichols, who, I'm sorry to say, is still not familiar with Ghandi, and with the kids ditching school in Canada were, I thought, the most imortant. People who have been writing reviews of this have either been apparantly so enlightened by this movie that ""OMG!!! 5 stars...this is genious! Guns are terrible!"" or ranted that ""Moore sucks, GUNS UP!"" Well, this movie is NOT about guns. It's about Americans as human beings, and why we don't (as a whole) have as much regard for life as say, Canadians or the French. That's what this film is attacking. I guess you could say that its attacking our culture, but that didn't bother me. People are either so far to the left or so far to the right that they can't see this movie for what it is.\nThis *MOVIE* is worth seeing.\nA for point and some of the content.

264;410.0;5.0;6.0;What's interesting about Bolwing For Columbine is that Michael Moore doesn't really come to many conclusions. Instead, he opens up a discussion about the alarming fact that America has a lot more gun violence than almost any country on earth.\nUsing the Columbine school shooting as the basis of his inquiry, Moore looks at the wider question and talks to a lot of people, from victims of the shooting to Marilyn Manson to Chuck Heston. A lot of possibilities are thrown around but this film is more about the problem than pinning down a solution.\nThe extras are interesting, too, including Moore's own detailed account of the infamous Oscar speech. He explains why he gave the speech, and after seeing the movie and hearing his explanation it's understandable why he gave the speech he did.;Asks a question worth asking...
278;411.0;5.0;6.0;A lot of gun nuts hated him even before that. But please don't dismiss this documentary. He drifts away from his subject at times but it is still compelling as hell. Please see it. Liberal or conservative, (open your mind for a least 2 hours) pro-gun or anti-gun. Part with a couple of bucks & rent the tape if you can't bear to buy it. The Heston interview is the least of the whole film. It's a real simple equation: fewer guns = fewer dead Americans.;Mike Moore sure pissed off a lot a people at the Oscars.
298;412.0;5.0;6.0;When I first purchased this DVD, all I knew was what I had seen of Michael Moore at the Oscars, which at the time made me furious for questioning the war in Iraq.  I felt and still believe that we needed to get rid of a madman who was slaughtering his own people and was a threat to the world.\nWhat I found when I began watching Bowling for Columbine was not some demon left-wing commie, but someone who loves America, is part of the NRA, and who genuinely wants to find out why Americans seem to be so violent.  And then I watched as Moore tore down the typical reasons given: less guns in other countries, less ethincity, less bloody histories.\nI have always had my own opinion of why it happens, as I'm sure everyone has, and this movie reinforced my own beliefs as I'm sure it enforces others in different ways.  I am the last one to point fingers, but I see it every day.  Americans seem to be obsessed with death.  Whether it's rubbernecking at an accident, watching the evening news reports, we seem to be fascinated with the misery of others.  I am guilty of this, and I do not blame anyone else.  That is one major problem I see and what I believe is a primary reason here.\nWe in this country love to blame others for our woes, both personally and collectively.  We armed Usama bin Laden against the Soviets, Iraq against Iran, and watched them turn our own weapons on us as well as their own people.  But it is not that simple.\nIt's easy to blame the media, but they are simply giving the public what they want to see.  Are video games and violent TN shows the culprit?  Tell that to Ed Gein or Albert Fish.  I don't remember Hitler owning a Playstation.  Marilyn Manson?  Simply theatrics, did Mozart inspire the Nazis?  We have a bloodthirst and a detachment from others that transcends all this.\nI was here during the horrible riots in downtown Cincinnati.  We still suffer repurcusions of that.  I volunteered with fear in my heart to be a tutor and a mentor in the Washington Park area downtown, right in the heart of where the riots took place.  And dammit, it still makes me nervous to go there.  Have I ever been threatened?  Not even close.  The children are wonderful, people are helpful, and once I get over the jitters I see that it is not what it has been made out to be.  But violence is a commodity that sells in the United States, and as long as we keep buying the hype it will not cease.\nI do disagree with Michael Moore's politics at times, as I do many others, but I can see that his heart is in the right place.  If we had more caring people trying to make a difference instead of living in fear, perhaps we could bridge these gaps.  I know that despite these deep-seeded premonitions that I may always carry due to conditioning, I'm not giving up on those kids in Washington Park.  I still love my president, and support him as a patriotic American, but healthy debate is what makes us the democracy that others in repressed societies admire.  Don't ever stop going after the truth Mr. Moore, though we may not vote for the same person, we do have a common goal to make our country better for everyone.\nAnd to the conservatives out there, if you pass over this documentary as I almost did, you are only hurting yourselves and possibly your country that you love so much.  And to all the victims of our countries imperfections, you will not be forgotten.;Conservatives can be open-minded too
299;413.0;3.0;6.0;"Like Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken, Michael Moore is an entertaining propagandist, but that's about it -- an ideologue flailing away at one of the most important issues of our time. He thoroughly fails at his mission of finding out why Americans kill each other with guns and instead descends into the leftist mantras of America's the world's great Satan (sometimes deserved), NRA bashing (also sometimes deserved) and ""inanimate objects made us do it"" (let's get K-Mart). He even totally loses it and tries to blame one killing on Dick Clark.\nMoore uses his standard tactic of bushwhacking people with a camera and creative editing (fun but ultimately pathetic). That Chuck Heston was dumb enough to let Moore anywhere near him with a camera, blows my mind. I guess he really does have dementia.\nIronically, Heston's ill-advised musings really do touch on a HUGE factor in America's gun violence rate as compared to other countries -- one that Moore is completely unable to recognize or explore because of his own bias. I'm talking about black-on-black inner-city violence. Few people, especially an agenda-driven leftist like Moore, are willing to point out that if you remove unfortunate inner-city blacks from the murder statistics, America's gun murder rates are about the same as Europe's. It's sad, true, and thoroughly un-PC to mention it. In total denial, Moore even suggests that Canada with its much lower gun-violence rate is as ethnically diverse as we are, which is absurd (Canada is 13% non-white, 2% black).\nObviously, this does not mean that we do not have a problem, and there are a large number of social/historical factors that figure into why the urban black portion of our society is suffering as it is. However, it does make one wonder about the quality and objectivity of Moore's ""investigation.""\nMoore hardly even mentions the inner-city crime issue, but surprisingly Heston does (indirectly). Moses obviously has thought and read quite a bit about our gun-related social woes (God, I would hope so). Unfortunately he did not have the forethought or finesse to explain it to Michael. I suspect that even if he had (maybe he did), the tape would have wound up on the cutting room floor -- smug, pseudo-Nazi, gun-lobby leaders are far more entertaining and in keeping with Moore's agenda. In short, this film is more about justifying Moore's poorly thought-out opinion than about exploring the issue.\nIt's also important to understand that the film's centerpiece, the horrible, graphic school shootings, have little effect on our murder rate. They create media frenzies (especially when they involve whites shooting whites) but they are a very small part of the picture. FAR more kids drown in pools (around 300) in the USA every year than are shot by their classmates at school. To his credit, Moore did quite nicely touch on the media distortion factor.\nIn summary, this movie is worth watching, and it's quite scary or funny on occasion. It makes some good points. Just make sure to take it with a grain of salt the size of Montana (you know, that state full of white gun nuts).";Entertaining Propaganda
309;414.0;3.0;6.0;"This is a great documentary on the issue of gun control in the USA.  As a proponent of some sort of gun control, I think Moore nailed this aspect of the film by showing the widespread availability of hand guns and automatic weapons, and the gun culture that is America.  He begins with a hilarious bit about a bank that gives away a free gun when you open a checking account.  (What happened to toasters?).  His use of media images of military bombings, murders, and the infamous Columbine tragedy, highlight the need for some sort of control in this arena.  The depictions of media creating fear at every turn was excellent, as if we needed any more reasons to not trust everything the media throws our way as reality.\nHowever, the film quickly derails into often absurd and even embarrassing tangents.  Perhaps the most glaring of these illogical assertions is that somehow the ""work for welfare"" program in Michigan is at fault for a 6-year-old who kills a classmate with a loaded handgun brought from home.  The music played during this stretch was beyond an obvious attempt at some sort of victimhood celebration. His attempts to corner Dick Clark as a cause, because a restaurant that bears his name employs some welfare recipients, was a complete embarrassment to Moore and anyone who would buy into such tripe.  His attempts to play racism, and play to the victim mentality of the liberal left were sad and pathetic.  What started as a needed and apolitical message about violence is somehow now related to Moore's socialistic worldview?  He really lost me here.\nThere are a few other interesting aspects he explored.  He takes two of the Columbine victims to the K-Mart headquarters to protest the fact that K-Mart sells bullets.  (The Chris Rock sketch on bullet control is worth the price of admission alone, and is a better solution.)  What Moore seems to forget is that his beloved Flint, Michigan's main manufacturing product was automobiles, which through misuse kill more people than all the bullets sold at all stores combined.  Would he protest one of those places?  Even more absurd is that fact that he states to Charlton Heston, leader of the NRA, that he Moore is in fact a member of the NRA!  Moore even shows him his membership card.  Then he proceeds to try and blame Heston for the killing of the 6-year-old?  Did anyone actually miss this blatant hypocrisy?\nOverall, this is typical Moore work.  His attempts to demonstrate the problem of gun use to kill others in our culture, as it compares to the rest of the free world, was excellent.  However, in the end, Moore offers no solutions, plays the victim aspect to the fullest, and leaves the viewer with nothing more than an inside look at his socialistic agenda. One gets the impression that Moore really has no idea how to solve these issues, nor what their cause is, beyond implementing a program of socialism or communism.  A wasted effort, which could have been a much-needed message on gun control.";Great start, nails the gun control issue, then derails.
310;415.0;3.0;6.0;"I wish I could split my rating - because this movie can be divided into two parts.  The first hour and a half was extraordinary.  Moore managed an honestly objective look at the subject, exploring with what at least appeared to be an open mind the reasons for the gun-death rate being so high in America.  Many good points were made and sound arguments brought out (I was particularly interested in the argument about the negetive re-enforcement of U.S. news media and how they and their advertisers use fear to sell their own newscasts and the products they advertise).  Truth be told, no one makes a pseudo-documentary like Michael Moore!\nHowever, as he often does, Moore manages to throw away any good points he earned with the first half by drowning the final thirty minutes of the movie in an attempt to lay the blame for Columbine and other shootings at the feet of K-Mart, Dick Clark, and Charlton Heston!  Moore's style in these segments echo the more irritating portions of Roger and Me - the idea tha because someone says something stupid (or refuses to speak at all) when a camera is suddenly shoved in their face, therefore they MUST be to blame for all of society's ills!  Moore needs to learn a little respect for other people if he is going to try to be a mouthpiece for the causes he believes in.  Like I said, I think he has alot of good things to say, but these guerilla-camera tactics draw attention away from the good and instead reveal what an a**hole he can be.  I mean - what's the deal with the whole Dick Clark encounter?!  Let me lay this out for you - a 1st grader shoots another 1st grader.  We learn the gun came from his uncle's house.  The kid is living with his uncle because his mother cannot afford to house him or put him in day care.  She can't because she is on welfare and expected to (I believe the word he uses is FORCED TO) work outside of Flint in Dick Clark's such-and-such restaraunt.  So what does Moore do?  He heads right out to interview Dick Clark, and stands in appaled shock with that ""shame-on-you-Dick-Clark"" look on his face as Clark refuses to talk to him and drives off.  See what I'm saying?  The fault for the shooting is laid on Dick Clark  because a restaurant he's probably never stepped into which happens to have his name on it hired a woman whose son stole his uncle's gun and shot a girl?  That's Dick Clark's fault?  Where is the interview with the school for the gun making it into the classroom - how about interviewing the mother for being so removed from her son he would be led to do such a thing - how about intervieing the uncle for having a home in which a first-grader could even handle a gun, much less take it out of the house!\nWhat's worse is the commentary track by his interns and assistants.  Kudos for a great idea, letting the ""little guy"" talk for once.  But the result here is just a Michael Moore fan-club.  The kiddos on the commentary clearly worship the ground he walks on and hope to be him when they grow up.\nSo - FIVE stars for the first portion of the film that is a credit to Moore and all who worked on the film.  But ZERO stars for the final act in which Moore sabotages his work and the work of those who helped him by being pretentious and trying to earn a few extra viewers with ""controversial filmmaking.""  That averages to about THREE stars as a total - and even THAT is generous, considering!";Two-thirds good, one-third manipulative and stupid!
316;416.0;5.0;6.0;"Ultimately, Michael Moore fails to answer the question that is essentially the basis for ""Bowling for Columbine"": why are Americans so violent?  There are no easy answers to that question.  Moore centers the film in Littleton, Colorado and the shootings at Columbine High where he tries to make sense of the senseless.  It's a difficult task.  Moore travels to Canada, where there are millions of guns but few gun-related deaths.  Why? The viewer is frustrated, along with Moore, that this question cannot be answered.\nShock rocker Marilyn Manson, whose fans included Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, is interviewed by Moore, and displays more intelligence and empathy than he is given credit.  What would he say, Moore asks, to Harris and Klebold?  Nothing, Manson replied.  ""I'd listen to them.""\nSure, Moore takes some dramatic license in the film.  The opening segment has Moore at a bank that offers a free rifle for opening an account.  The piece is edited to look as if Moore got the gun right away, which he didn't; he had to wait for a background check.  But that's really a non-issue, as Moore illustrates: how absurd is it for a bank to give guns to customers?  Another segment has Moore purchasing ammunition from a barber shop, as he gets a haircut.  All of it ties together to the fact that guns are everywhere, readily available to anyone who wants them, and lots of people are dying because of it.\nOther segments center on the NRA and it's then-president, Charlton Heston.  Moore is granted an interview by Heston at his Hollywood Hills estate.  Heston has no answers, either, on the subject of gun deaths, other than the fact that the U.S. is of ""mixed"" ethnicity.  Heston has lots of guns.  Not that he needs them, with his well-guarded home.\nIn the end, Moore raises many thought-provoking points, but offers few answers.  Unfortunately, there aren't any.";Thought provoking look at the culture of violence
326;417.0;4.0;6.0;"While there are no words, nor is there any film that can alleviate the hurt and the sorrow that the people of Littleton, Colorado carry with them every day, talking about ""why"" is imperative to the healing process.  Having asked this question to himself, Michael Moore began looking into the culture that could birth such a violent incident.  This film travels through Moore's own thought process into what he believes is the root cause of much of the violence in society today: Fear.\nMr. Moore believes that the United States was born of fear, and that the culture of fear is a catalyst in the American propensity towards violence.  The murder rate in the United States is ten times that of our neighbors to the north, and a rate several times that of many other western nations.  Many of these countries have far fewer guns as the citizenry is not allowed to possess firearms.  Canada, on the other hand, is much like America in that a person can own a wide assortment of guns.\nMoore's previous works were more concise and collected; more to the point.  Bowling for Columbine was Moore coming to his own conclusions, not having them completely formed in his own mind.  This made for a somewhat scattered film at times, but it also made for a film that was very human; very real.\nProblems came in the fact that Moore often asked questions of people who really could not answer.  Some inquiries could not be answered for business reasons and some for the fact that the questions themselves were simply unanswerable.  While many of the concepts, people, and organizations that were brought into question in the film, were brought up for valid reasons, the attack on K-Mart was simply out of line and sensational.  Moore was guilty of his own criticism and used media tactics to corner the retailer into submission.\nAside from the few minor contradictory issues that came up through the film, it was spectacular.  Bowling for Columbine brought into question the systemic reasons for the violence in America.  He brought light onto the idea that the culture of fear is perpetuated by the media and by the government. Some of the most insightful moments of the film actually came from shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.  As one of the primary targets of the religious right during the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, Manson was amazingly understanding of the people, and expressed his feelings over why violence continues.\nOne of the most memorable concepts that resonated throughout the film was that of the NRA's tendency to arrive in areas in the wake of terrible events.  The NRA came to Denver within a month of the Columbine tragedy, and then within a week of the shooting death of Kayla Rolland in a Flint Michigan elementary school, even after pleas for them to stay away.  Charlton Heston and the NRA showed an amazing amount of insensitivity in their presence in these places.  While they have the right to be there, it showed how far they are willing to go, and how much they really do not care who they hurt in their wake.  They refused to give a grief-stricken community time to heal.\nThe film did have its problems, but it was amazingly powerful.  It was very emotional. Though it was apparent that this film was a ""work in progress,"" while Moore himself sorted out why he thought there was such excessive violence in America, it came to rather concise points.  This is a film, no matter what a persons political beliefs are, that should be seen.  It will provoke thought, one way or another.\nepc";The Culture of Fear . . . .

Though many of Moore's critics have called him on making his documentaries too personal, I find his humanity refreshing. It's not a man in a tweed jacket pointing to Civil War photos and speaking in haughty language about the history of some mysterious ""American Culture."" No, what you will find in Bowling for Columbine is a real account of a trigger-happy people, who in the process are finding a lot of misery. This film should be required viewing for all American high schoolers.";Bowling for Columbine bowled me over!
362;421.0;5.0;6.0;Sometimes the truth hurts, and sometimes it should. We all need a reality check here and there and Michael Moore is just the guy to pull it off on such a wide scale. You'll laugh (really hard), you'll cry (even harder), and you'll leave feeling empowered if you are anything like me. Although I may not agree with his every quip and theory, I agree with his purpose and I think he is a shinging star of honesty in the sludge of lies and misrepresentations that is our beloved media.

Americans have a very hard time seeing through all of the corporate propaganda that has them beleiving that they too are beneficiaries of corporate profits or Bush's Oil wars etc. This movie is about MUCH more than the Columbine shooting, guns, or gun-control. Moore's systemic analysis of violence and capitalism is done in a way that would appeal to Americans who are not likely to sit through any kind of analysis. Amazing. Go Mike!!!\n\nConsidering the firestorm this film created - It's hard to believe that so many people have such strong feelings against Mike and his film! Hmmmm...I wonder if he hit a nerve??

Further - since when were documentaries supposed to be objective and NOT be opinionated?? What? Heston didn't say those things?? The people he interviewed were bamboozled and tricked?? C'mon - the corporate PR machine has got to come up with more than that...""he used fancy editing tricks..."", ""he's a godless, freedom-hating commie...""

413;424.0;3.0;6.0;"To say this is a documentary is to say facts are not important to documentaries.\nI enjoyed this film because I can see it for what it is.  Kind of like Stone's JFK, a slanted view, even fictious view, of the facts to produce a certain impact upon the viewer.\nI.E.:  The Willie Horton ad in the moive was composed from two different ads, and the words ""And he kills again"" were put in there by Moore to shock the viewer, Horton [attacked] a woman not killed her.\nThe Heston speech at Devner was edited from 3 different speeches to produce a speech which he never gave.  The NRA ""gun rally"" was in fact a convention organized 4 years prior that was curtailed in deffernce to the shooting.\nThe Flint rally occured 8 months after the shooting, and during a campain season.  Yet Moore gives the impression it happened within days of the shooting.\nThe end scene was reshot by Moore to get the two POVs used, or else how can the viewer not see another camera.\nAll in all, I enjoyed this movie, though I cannot take it seriously, like JFK.  If you have a grasp on reality and can see this for what it is you'll enjoy it.  If you don't have a grasp on reality and really think LBJ escalated the Vietnam War to sell more helocoptors then you'll like this as well.";Best documentary since JFK!!
417;425.0;5.0;6.0;That's what happens in this wonderful documentary about America's fascination with violence. It helped with the beginning of opening my eyes in the world we live in.

This is a movie that really makes you think about why our society is so violent in comparison to other countries.  This movie has a really deep concept and it gets you thinking at many levels but it also had me laughing out loud in a lot of parts!  There's cartoon clips & funny/sarcastic moments inserted throughout the film.  I really like Michael Moore's documentary style as ""the average guy""; it works for him!  I've seen 2 of his other films but this one is the best.  Everyone will find this movie interesting!";Everyone should see this movie!
426;427.0;5.0;6.0;This is actually a film that conservatives liked, it was after all a pro-arms film.  If you watch it it is obvious and anyone who doesn't like it, after the Oscars where Moore (totally his right and responsibility too) spoke his mind are showing what trash they are.  This is a film all AMERICANS should watch.  It is about violence and how much we seem to need it as opposed to other countries where they have guns but nowhere near the violent streak we do here.  This truly is thee most important film to be released in a very long, long time.  Will it change our country?  I doubt it.;Brilliant essay on our society.
438;428.0;5.0;6.0;"What makes this film so remarkable is the truth that it ultimately tells. Simplisticly he traces the rampant gun mania in this country back to the origins of this country being on genocide and slavery. I'd seen Moore talk about his film on Oprah at length before I saw this film, as well as the three minute cartoon that traces the US history and shows the paranoia that white people have been engendered with.\nA film that focuses on gun control becomes about race and racism. The racial portrayal of people of color in the media, the media eagerly showing particular races ad nauseum commiting crimes, over and over and over, forcing white people to believe their engendered fears about other races. The audience laughed at all the appropriate parts until it became about race, then only the people of color laughed because of the bitter truth of the entire situation. White people are afraid to admit this truth, this fear, this internalized terror that seems to stalk so many to the point of getting as many guns as possible.\nCharlton Heston, spokesman for the NRA, is interviewed in the film and even he admits that part of the problem, the crime is because of so many ethnicities in this country.\nWhite people are so afraid. Afraid because America is a Me culture, unlike other countries that have socialized medicine, socialized care for the elderly, and at some level while it affords immediate gratification, we all understand that isn't right.\nI don't know how to make White people less scared, to get a population of 280 million to relinquish having 250 million guns or 750 million televisions which honestly is becoming a manifestation of what we all project as ""the Devil"". We're slowly imploding into consumerism, a mentality of attack, attack, attack with a focus on war and destruction and killing each other. Frankly, after leaving the movie, I was ashamed that I lived in a country where our children can turn not only physically, whether purposefully as in Columbine or in Flint, accidentally, to killing. Children are killing. What else do we need as a wake up call?\nI took a class man years ago taught by an Indian chief and his lesson was that every culture has armageddon mythology but that American Indian mythology includes that the winds will be out of control, that our weather patterns will no longer make sense and the next that our children will kill. I do believe that the focus of television and video games and movies teaches children HOW to kill and destroy but it is America's lack of emapthy and compassion that teaches them WHY to kill.\nWhen so many people Moore interviewed were asked why they were arming themselves, they came back to the 2nd Amendment, to the necessity to protect themselves, their families, to the fear of the THEM coming for them whether it be government or SOMEONE, colored ultimately and I thought to myself what people of color are taught from a young age: White people are crazy, and now there's a film to support that theory.\nStatistically it bears out that Black peopel have actually committed less crime in teh past 10 years than White people, 30% lowering while there has been a 600% increase in teh showing of black men as criminals on TV.  Amazingly companies like Enron and World Com that financially rape millions of people of their entire lives are shown briefly before we get back to the projected terrorists and racial dangers here in America.  White citizens born into fear and constantly propogandized by television about fearing are arming themselves and ironically as we learned in Columbine, killing themselves.  White children go hog wild with guns, white men are more apt to commit suicide and take the family with them, white peopel wage war without the UN support and teh rest of us sit and watch.\nI've been to Canada and honestly the White people there are different, maybe it's more space, maybe it's because they are a country committed to caring about people, not just thru lip service but through social and financial commitment---free medical care for EVERYONE, care for the elderly, a higher unemployment rate but a giv't committed to employing it's citizens.  A mass of 30 million people who have 7 million guys and less than 200 gun shootings a year.  America, 280 million has close to 12,000 gun murders a year.  Even by the simplistic math of avering 10 times more in population we should only have 2000 average gun related shootings a year and yet we have 6 times THAT amount.\nAmerica is hemorraging from lack of social care for EVERYONE, rich or poor, lack of parental classes, lack of marital classes, lack of integrity, lack of responsible election processes, lack of big business regulation and lack of respect for the world.  Its funny how this film correlates the ideology into the political system, but like a disease this is rampant to the very concept of the 3 card monte deal of hunting for Osama to blaming Saddam Hussein for the world's teroristic problems.  Bush knows how many weapons of mass destruction are in Iraq, why?>  because his daddy sold them to Iraq when Hussein was helped to established power by the US to oppose Iran.  We didn't care about the actions of teh regime then, it was only when oil prices went up that we became concerned about the second largest producer of oil on the planet.\nCuriously enough I got an email about my initial review of thsi film that told me to ""go back home"" if I didn't like it here.  In truth, I am Naragansett Indian, an undistrubed line from my great-grandfather, anyone not of American Indian descent is on MY land my the legal possession rights of America.  I am home.  But hasn't that always been the racist yell from the battle for Integration, to vote, to exist?  That if anyone here in America disagrees, as supposedly allowed in a democracy, they should :go back to where THEY came from"".  Again that ""THEM"".  I expect that not every person of any color shares the masses attitudes, except perhaps in this country that through first genocide of millions of Indians and then slavery of several races to build up the financial base became the mess we have today.";One of the best films in quite a while!

37;435.0;1.0;5.0;It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.

43;436.0;3.0;5.0;"Does life have a meaning and a purpose?\n\nIf you answer yes, then logic dictates that everything we do in life has meaning and effect and that effect must be either negative or positive. There is no in-between, Marilyn Manson's comments not withstanding.\n\nOur actions, and the actions of those around us, either build us up or tear us down; increase our respect for ourselves and others or reduce that respect; give us hope and a positive outlook or create fear, resentment, and insecurity.\n\nWhen you're forced to put the influences on our young people into only the columns of good or bad, and not allow yourself to hide behind the ""it doesn't matter"" excuse, the problem begins to emerge. Divorce; consumerism; abortion; violence both real and simulated in the news, TV, sports, movies, and video games. An over-emphasis on competition with other people.\n\nIt all adds up. There is no way to legally prove that Marilyn Manson ever caused anyone to act viloently. But would you agree that his influence is never positive? If so, he goes in the bad column and someday he will be forced to answer for the way he used his time and talents in the pursuit of fame and money. I'm glad I'm not him.\n\nHas our society been ""bowling for Columbine""?  You betcha. But guns (an inanimate object) never impact a person's attitude. They are a tool, nothing more. Easy access to guns raises the likelihood of deadly viloence for a person already inclined toward such actions. But guns, in and of themselves, never influence anyone. They don't even fit the category of actions, so we can't put them in either the good or bad column.\n\nOur children are scared, lonely, cynical, insecure, sedentary, overly-competitive, isolated, and screaming for our attention.\n\nWe're so busy earning money for a new SUV, getting divorced, terminating pregnancies, consuming alcohol and sleep aids, using the TV as a babysitter, trying to look younger, and buying our kids off with gifts that we've forgot to love our children.\n\nMake a movie about that, and I'd give it 10 stars";Good film, but doesn't get to the real issues
47;437.0;5.0;5.0;"Love him or hate him, Michael Moore is what he is--a muckraking gadfly of very liberal political persuasion--and there is nothing that anyone can do about it.  But make no mistake about it: He loves America, and is concerned for it.  His crusading populism dates back to 1989's ROGER AND ME; and his brand of gentile guerilla filmmaking reached a peak in 2002 with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, which won that year's Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.\n\nHere, Moore, who ironically enough is a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, takes a look at the culture of fear in our country that makes certain people take up guns for whatever reason they deem necessary and use the Second Amendment of the Constitution as their brace.  The title of this film refers to what Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibold were doing on the morning of April 20, 1999 prior to them entering Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado and snuffing out the lives of twelve students and one teacher before turning their guns on themselves.\n\nIn this 2-hour expose, and utilizing his trademark brand of dark humor laced with barely contained anger, Moore talks with those who were at the scene of the horrific events at Columbine, as well as former Columbine student and ""South Park"" creator Matt Stone, and shock rocker Marilyn Manson (who was used as a convenient whipping boy because the Columbine shooters were big fans of his), among others, and takes us inside the Michigan militia, whose obsessions with guns attracted Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols (the guys who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City in April 1995), and talks with an indignant James Nichols (Terry's brother), who just looks and talks like the sort of gun-crazed wacko the media make him out to be.\n\nBut Moore, typically, doesn't stop there.  He indicts the American media for putting fear and loathing into people for showing gun crimes done (seemingly) exclusively by gang-bangers who happen to be black; he cites statistics that show that America has a higher murder rate than any ""civilized"" nation in the world; and he shows the social and economic conditions around his own hometown of Flint, Michigan that led to a young little girl named Kayla being accidentally shot by a classmate with a gun he found lying around his mother's home.\n\nAnd that's still not enough.  For despite being a member of the NRA, he calls to the carpet that very same organization for holding its annual meeting in Denver in 1999, a mere few miles from Columbine, and later in Flint, just weeks after Kayla's death.  And in the end, he asks some very tough questions of actor and former NRA president Charlton Heston about why it is that other countries with proportionally as many guns to people as America have much lower murder rates than we do.  Heston boils it down to our nation having ""a history of violence and blood on its hands"" (no surprise there) and ""mixed ethnicities"" (coming from a man who marched with Martin Luther King in Washington in 1963, that last comment *is* a shock; but given his political turn towards the far right in the 1970s, that too ends up as being less of a shock than it otherwise might be).\n\nMoore doesn't offer any easy answers for why America's obsession with guns is so great, because there just aren't any.  But he does strongly point the finger at our violent past and present, coming right up to and slightly beyond the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and says that this past and our present fears of gangs and terrorists spawning a mindset of packing heat isn't going to make America a safer nation.  This is a totally reasonable conclusion that those who would condemn Moore for this film (and for that matter for FAHRENHEIT 9/11 which, given how *this* film briefly touches on 9/11, they should have seen coming) don't want to come to grips with, probably because it requires them to look in the mirror and see the face they don't really want to see.\n\nBOWLING FOR COLUMBINE categorically does NOT condemn the Second Amendment or the right for people to bear firearms.  Nor does it slander either Heston or the NRA.  It indicts the political, social, and economic culture in America that makes incidents like Columbine and 9/11 not only possible, but inevitable.  And on that note, Moore, with his usual trademark techniques, has more than done his job as a muckraker, a filmmaker, and a true example of American patriotism.";Shoot To Kill
51;438.0;5.0;5.0;"Honestly, I saw this movie about 4-5 months ago and thought it was kind of ok/slightly boring.  But after 4-5 months of actually following U.S. politics and policies, I watched this DVD again and I was impressed.\n\nI'm not going to get into any arguments for or against gun control because that's not the (most) important issue in my opinion. The important issue which is shown in this movie (I suggest you read a book or two by Moore and Hegenomy or Survival by Noam Chomsky to really appreciate this documentary) is what is the cause of fear in Americans? Why do we always use minorities, non-Christians, the poor, etc. as the scapegoats for our problems? Why do we beat up on people who can't fight back - while at the same time give huge tax cuts to corporations and the rich.\n\nOf course Moore has a great way of showing emotion and I cried a couple of times while watching the movie.\n\nI won't get into the story, other reviewers can probably do that much better than me. One part which was very important was when Moore plays the song, ""It's a Wonderful World"" and talks about how time after time again the U.S. has overthrown democratically elected leaders and installed dictators or supported dictators financially and with weapons.  He even talks about the Taliban and Saddam!! And this movie was made before we invaded Iraq.\n\nOne thing I really like about Moore is that he actually shows the story from the point of view of minorities. Instead of politicians or corporation owners who take pictures with minorities and make sure there is plenty of media to see, Moore actually cares about helping minorities instead of making dumb jokes about them like people do on TV or using them for photo ops.\n\nThe welfare to work part of the movie is really good. That's something a normal person like me would never have had the brain power to think of unless someone spells it out. The way Dick Clark does not listen really bugged me. And the part with Charton Heston saying his ""colored people"" remark made me angry.\n\nFinally, Moore is a brave brave man. Going up against the 3 million member strong NRA, unflinchingly talking to the Michigan Militia, arguing with the psycho who showed Moore the gun in his bedroom and walking down South central L.A., Moore has guts.\n\n10,000 stars out of 5!";Too Good
58;439.0;5.0;5.0;"I thought the ending, the interview with Charlton Heston, required courage but my German wife thought that Heston was too old and senile to be manhandled that way. I thought he deserved it. Moore raises the big question but doesn't answer it: Swiss and Canadians have guns and hunt (so do Norwegians), Canadians are about as big gun nuts as US citizens, but Swiss and Canadinas don't kill each other (and Norway has extremely low crime), so why not? What is it that makes so many Americans trigger happy and violent? For a possible answer, see George Lakoff's ""Moral Politics"", which traces the 50/50 religious/secular split in America to two different prevailing sets of family values. And, surprise, surprise, it's not the secular people who are promote violence, it's the religious ones, the same group that gave us the Iraq war of aggression.";Leaves a big, interesting unanswered question

67;441.0;2.0;5.0;"I don't know why they call this a documentary, the main thing it documented me about is how subtle Moore trays to manipulate the viewer to what he wants. This is not PBS people, I never saw the interview of a sociologist or psychologist, but Moore did found time to have a moronic conversation with Marilyn Manson (...). Then later in the film he trays to enter his stubborn communist beliefs by almost blaming Dick Clark for the murder of a poor girl by a kid who took a gun to school. In it he argues that because the mother had to leave the child in the home of a family member to go work at a Dick Clark owned restaurant (witch he ridiculously calls ""a restaurant for the rich"" when is obvious that is nothing more than another ordinary dinner in a mall) the child took the gun at this house because the mother wasn't with him, and that is Dick Clark's fault. The reality is that this is again the typical story of another young black woman with a child and no father figure, so all the weight falls on her to raise him, or not be able to. Now, what the hell does Dick Clark's restaurant or any other for that matter have to do with that? He is trying to create the rich vs. poor lets blame the abuse of the rich communist crap (when there is nothing more capitalistic and much more than capitalistic than a communist, but anyhow). This crap comes as no surprise from a fool that in his own website has written in favor of the communist system in Cuba. It seems he only sees abuse and lies when he wants to.\n\n  Then he insinuates that the adults who live in Columbine Colorado are many violent people that pass this violence to their children because many of them work for the U.S.A army in a missile factory. With this argument the policemen are also violent and firemen I suppose like to play with fire. You tell me, yeah let's dismantle the U.S.A army tomorrow because the rest of the world is Disney World. Then at the end of the movie he puts the cap to the battle by going to visit Charlton Heston and give him a hard time about the N.R.A, when Moore himself shows Chalrlton his N.R.A membership card.??? If you are looking for something serious this is not it. This movie has a hidden purpose behind it, don't overlook that.";A hidden purpose
70;442.0;5.0;5.0;The ultimate purpose of this documentary, like many of Michael Moore's documentaries is to make you think.  He asks questions that many people do not want to ask and has the information to back-up his claims.\n\nIt is true that sometiems Michael Moore tends to edit his films in such a way that it appears that the information could be misleading.  Yes, he also tends to be one sided, but it is not the point of this review to judge the film based on its accuracy, but rather on how well it was made.\n\nThis documentary was made very well.  Every scene was fantastic, and I especially enjoyed the cartoon about the history of America.  Also, it was good to see how people in other countries view the United States.\n\nThe film was very well made it caused me to actually want and think about violence, and how violent a country the United States actually is.  The movie was able to make me laugh, cry, be angry, and be somewhat at peace.  All these complicated emootions from just watching a movie.  Above all, this movie made me realize how unique America is.\n\nSo if you want to see a movie that will challenge you, see this movie.;Makes You Think
72;443.0;5.0;5.0;Many folks seem so tied up by this movie, but I think they missed the point.  Moore is an artist, and I say that without revealing whether I agree or disagree with him.  His aim is to stir up thought and promote discourse and judging by the fact that there are an amazing 794 reviews on Amazon for this movie, I suspect he's done a damn fine job.\nWatch this movie.  Your brain will get a little exercise and you'll end up engaging in an Olympic-scale debate if you go out for a coffee with friends afterward.\nDespite the naysayers, Moore doesn't present only one side.  He lets others speak for themselves and, if they don't come off too well, that's probably because they aren't all that bright. You might just learn a little something by watching this one.  For example, as strange as it sounds, you might find Marilyn Manson and the creators of South Park to be more thoughtful and in touch than Charlton Heston or Dick Clark.  This movie has a way of making you reconsider traditionally accepted mores and behaviour. It offers a different explanation for many of our youth's social ills and it seems to be tapped into their consciousness better than most movies or books.\nWhether you agree or not, your brain will get the sort of kickstart not available from most movies and tv... and that's a very good quality in a movie.;Gotcha thinking, didn't he???
76;444.0;5.0;5.0;More Moore and less knee-jerk, proto-fascist ramblings from the neanderthal right. Why don't all you slack jawed, neo-con types just go vote Bushie and let the smart folks have a scrap of truth now and then? By the way, I actually saw the film, that means Moore got some of my dough. Hope that reeeeally bugs ya!;More Moore Please!
97;445.0;4.0;5.0;"My first meeting with Michael Moore was through this particular movie. It was to be a beginning for a mutual journey - I really like his documentaries because they have a tendency of provoking thoughts and discussion among viewers. Facts are often yielded to Mike's personal opinions and conclusions which decreases accurateness. Hence, the documentary challenges its viewers to critical thinking. Personally I believe, any book, movie or documentary that provokes discussion and debate is worth seeing; this one is no exception.\n\nActually, I saw the film accidentally in the movies and it was so masterfully made that it immediately captivated my attention. The film is very thought provoking in the sense that it asks several very valid questions about American Gun Culture and then tries to come up with answers.\n\nDwelling little bit further on facts that the movie presents, one will discover that Mike could have done better job with checking facts. The documentary is also rather heavily edited and some clips are taken out of their respective context. In spite of this, Mike seems to be able to present his case rather validly.\n\nSome of his opponents use these inaccuracies as a way of discrediting the entire documentary. I feel they miss the point. The point is not to be 100% accurate at all times. For example, there is a scene in which Mike receives a gun as a thank you gift from the bank. The point is not how long it took, but are we supposed to receive a gun from the bank when we open an account? Does it really matter if it takes an hour or a day to clear the paperwork? The point is that the bank is giving away guns and is a licensed gun dealership.\n\nEven if you would disagree with Mike, you have to admit that he is a very skilled documentary maker. He knows how to edit, use captivating music and make the documentary a pleasure to watch.\n\nIn spite of its many accuracies, it is extremely thought provoking. Something that should be seen in all schools - and then be disuccessed.\n\nThe Special DVD package has an extra disc with many interesting Interviews and extra bonus material. The Extra Disc is worth watching (almost 2 hours of video footage) even if you had seen the documentary earlier. The Special Disc sheds additional light to the documentary and reflects points that were omitted from the actual documentary.\n\nStrongly recommended.";Captivating piece of art... facts could be more accurate.
103;446.0;5.0;5.0;"Michael Moore has produced a brilliant film in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" beginning to examine the question of gun violence in America.  What makes me appreciate this film the most is that it does not provide empty platitudes or draw simple conclusions, simultaneously keeping the level of conversation easy to understand and approachable.  Seeing Moore's work mature to this level is uplifting and encouraging, and we see it develop even further in his ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  He asks more questions than he answers, and does justice to the complexity of the topics (within the confines of a documentary film).  Whether you agree with him or not, Moore's gift is to get us talking and to ignite the flashpoints that will catalyze this country's continued growth.";Justice to complexity
114;447.0;5.0;5.0;Why is the rate of violent crime in America exponentially higher than in other developed countries?  Why are Americans so afraid of their neighbors?  Why, in places like Columbine, are children shooting each other?\nThis movie goes beyond Columbine to look at the larger question of the culture of violence in America, where it might come from, how it affects our lives, and what we might do about it.\nMoore raises more questions than he provides definitive answers.  But in a manner that is alternately comical and deadly serious, he explores an issue that is critical to the way we live and the type of society our children will grow up in.\nAn important film to watch.;asks the questions our society needs to consider
126;448.0;5.0;5.0;This is One Of The Greatest Documentaries ever to be Filmed, the Only One Greater is FAHRENHEIT 9-11(also By Moore)! Bowling For Columbine really shows the ugly side of CONservatives and exposes their wacky obssession with Guns. Michael Moore does a Great Job in telling about why CONservative Americans are so obssessed with Guns and why they are responsible for The United States having one of the worst murder rates in the world. No One is safe from this Film especially Charlton Heston who Michael Moore really lays to waste. Heston comes off like a CONservative Bitter Old Fool! This Film ROCKS! Michael Moore should be President!;MICHAEL MOORE IS AN AMERICAN HERO
128;449.0;5.0;5.0;"I find that a certain type of person rages against Mr. Moore because s/he doesn't like to be faced with the truth. The more you explain that his films and books are based on facts, the more this sort of person will get red in the face.\nAnyone watching ""Bowling for Columbine"" will have to admit that, well, Mr. Moore is simply showing us the truth. You can't argue with what happens when he visits K-Mart headquarters. You can't argue with what the kids are saying about what happened to them.\nWell, you can -- but then you are just displaying your ignorance, now aren't you?";You gotta love him
129;450.0;5.0;5.0;"Did even half you ignorant people out there actually watch the movie? No, I didn't think so. So why do we have a bunch of Americans complaining about this movie? Because you people know this man is right but aren't willing to admit the wrongs of your conservative ways. I've read a lot of 1 star reviews about this movie and it's pretty obvious these people haven't even watched the movie (yet they still write a review) because they assume that just because this film was made by Michael Moore (a brilliant director and infamous for his controversial political films/documentaries filled with tongue-in-cheek humour) that it will be bad. I agree that he goes overboard sometimes to exploit Americans and their government as much as possible, but can you really blame him? This movie goes into depth about Americans and their right to bear arms and it's connection with the shootings that took place a couple years back at Columbine high school in Colorado. It covers many topics such as  Charlton Heston and the NRA, Marilyn Manson and how his music is claimed to have an influence over troubled youth, a bank that gives out free guns to anyone who opens up a new account, local militia, a town gone insane and issues that every legal-aged citizen must own a firearm and so on and so on. I would love to go into great detail about this movie and bash everyone who claims it was all just a bunch of crap to fill people's heads with liberal propoganda but I won't be able to fit everything in this review so I'll keep it short and sweet. Charlton Heston is a senile old man that is up way past his bedtime to take a long dirt nap in the cold earth (it's kind of hypocritical for a man who appears in a classic movie such as ""The Ten Commandments"" and preaches about the sin of murder (thou shall not kill) to be shown at an NRA meeting a few days after the shootings supporting an instrument of death on national television further enraging families that have lost loved ones at the hands of two disturbed young men, isn't it? Not a very smart move, Charlie). Marilyn Manson (even though I'm not a fan of his music) has been proven to be a renowned yet misunderstood musician who is not even involved in any way in this tragedy, not even subliminally as most of you might be thinking. As for the bank that hands out free guns, that's just plain retarded. I've heard of banks giving out gifts or special offers for becoming a new member, but guns as gifts? That's just going too far, I could use that gun they give me to rob that very bank! A local militia is a really bad idea too because you have these untrained locals taking people's lives and safety within their own hands. Hello retards!...That's what the god damn police are there for and they are always reliable for safety and protection and plus you don't need freakin' AK-47's and automatic rifles for protection. It's not like you small town hicks have anything of high value to protect anyways and small towns usually have low crime rates anyway....try living in New York City and see how badly you would get mugged there. And the town gone nuts, what were you city officials smoking when you passed that law? Michael Moore also conducts a number of interviews with celebrities, government employees, and citizens alike. His intentionally stupid questions spawn a variety of replies and reactions from those he interviews. In conclusion, this movie is another blow to America's already shattered reputation as one of the most dangerous and crime-filled countries in the world run by a bunch of yahoo sons of b****es who can't tell the difference between what is right and what is wrong and another proud accomplishment for Michael Moore. Anyone who shares the same admiration and respect for Michael Moore as I do would be wise to see this movie and check out his other work such as the hilarious ""Canadian Bacon"" or his most recent documentary (this time tackling the issue of Bush and the US/Iraq war) Farenheit 9/11. As for you all you critics of his work....we don't need anymore pro-Bush advocates in this world, this is an issue too complex for your little minds to comprehend and this is one liberal you won't silence. Fight on Michael Moore! Fight on!";Did you people even watch the damn movie?
150;451.0;5.0;5.0;"Michael Moore's message isn't that all guns should be banned, it's that we need to take a good hard look at why this ""advanced"" country has the highest murder rate in the civilized world so we can improve ourselves as a nation.  He also has many brilliant things to say about our culture of fear, the media, poverty in the land of plenty and the bloody havoc this country has been reeking on other nations long before the invasion of Iraq (you will be shocked). Oh yeah, and there's a lot of great material about Canada too.  If you haven't seen this movie, you really, really should.  It's heartbreaking at times and funny at others.  It's simply brilliant, and I can't wait to see Farenheit 9/11--I'm sure it'll be explosive.";The most important movie of the decade
155;452.0;5.0;5.0;"I just got done reading through the reviews, and I love reading through them, because you find that these people did not pay attention to the film after the first hour of the movie. If they would have they would have noticed that Michael Moore did not blame the guns for the amount of murders in the US today; he blamed it more on Americans paranoia, and the liberal news media. He seemed to point out that while Canada has a lot of guns, they have around 100 murders a year. (Kinda interesting to point out that in Toronto he talks to a police officer who remembers 1 murder in the past decade, and that was commited by a man from Detroit.)\nThis is an excellent film, and I'd recomment it to everyone. (And to you gun nuts out there, the NRA should not have gone to Flint and Denver within days af the shootings there. That's just flat out ignorant.) Watch, and even if you are an NRA member, you might change your mind after seeing this.";This is kinda funny!
156;453.0;5.0;5.0;"Michael Moore has really outdone himself this time.  When I watched Roger & Me, Moore really pushed the envelope on really touchy subjects.  Bowling for Columbine is completely an ""in your face - no holds barred"" kind of movie.  I personally think that Michael Moore is brilliant.  His books are amazing as are his films.  He asks the questions and talks about the subjects that people would rather sweep under the mat.\nIn BFC, Moore sets out to explore the roots of why the United States of America is notorious for its astronomical number of people killed by firearms.  In doing so, he learns that the conventional answers of easy availability of guns, violent national history, violent entertainment and even poverty are inadequate to explain this violence when other cultures share those same factors without the equivalent carnage. In order to arrive at a possible explanation, Michael Moore takes on a deeper examination of America's culture of fear, bigotry and violence in a nation with widespread gun ownership.  It's an amazing documentary that will leave you shaking your head at times.";Perfection
161;454.0;3.0;5.0;"Michael Moore angers a ton of people with this slightly self-serving documentary about violence and fear in the United States. Moore uses the most terrible examples of gun violence from the past 5-10 years to show how backwards gun laws really are.\nMoore tried to answer his question ""Why is there so much gun violence and deaths in the US compared to any other country in the world?"" He tried to use the normal answers like television, our history, race, poverty, video games, music, etc. What Moore came up with was right on... the media. The media's portrayal of news, interesting stories and things to look out for condition the public to fear everything, everyone everywhere, especially minorities.\nAlthough for some parts of the documentary I found myself seeing Michael Moore use the same sort of tactics that nightly news uses, he definitely put together a great piece of art that was Oscar worthy (despite the fact that the extras of him retelling the night exemplified megalomania).\nMany people are reviewing this movie and focusing on dates, times and details that avoid the point of the film, which apparently must be restated:\n1) It is ok for people to own guns within reason: a handgun/shotgun to protect a family/property; a rifle to hunt with.\n2) The biggest problem is not the NRA, although their answers to question posed were very Bush-like (fuzzy, avoiding, and illogical), the problem is the way the media reacts and advertises. They try and make people fear the onset of spring and sunsets! NEXT AT 11 -- THE SUN WILL BE COMING UP RED TOMORROW MORNING -- IS THIS ANOTHER TEQUILA SUNRISE OR ARMAGEDDON? also, the bush administration rejects the kyoto protocol, allowing big corporations to pump pollution into the air making sunrises red (if we have time).";Almost There
163;455.0;3.0;5.0;I really wanted to like this film and it's producer. Always considering myself a gun-control advocate, I also had recoiled at the Littleton school shootings. It honestly pains me that I can not give Moore's work a higher rating.\nWithin hours of the event, Littleton represented an unsightly coalition of politics, school safety, and intra-community pluralism debates. Until it hit the affluent Denver suburb, people were content to pretend that school shootings were only something that happened in the inner cities (the enviroment suburbs were theoretically supposed to protect from). Littleton changed everything permanently.\nI realized the founding fathers inserted the Second Amendment in a time when there was no police and little evidence of goverment balance. In the abscence of supermarkets, guns were also a critical food source, no hunting could translate into no food supply. If they had lived today, the signers would be aghast some people are insisting on the right to purchase AK-47's. They would most likely be with Moore, myself and other peole who believe the right is not absolute and there are reasonable health and safety restrictions which can exist with the Amendment in place.\nFor another perspective, he travels to Canada. Although they do not have a Second Amendment, their streets are so safe the citizens do not lock their doors at night. Not coincidentally, the crime rate is so low that murders are an isolated occurence in that country. They are bewildered that Americans would want the chance to hurt others.\nMy problem with this film is Moore wastes two hours repeating his message. This potentially backfires with his 'alternative' doccumentary style which bluntly delivers the message the first time presented. Moore takes two hours to present information easily delivered in an hour and 30 minutes format. He does not appear to understand that we were already with him during the first time, and it is not how much you say but how you say things which attracts viewers.\nFilms are supposed to educate the audience, not make them look at their watches in a state of desperation. The best film in the world fails to live up to it's potential if key audiences (both the people who originally want to see and those needing to see a film) are detered by the length. Any family scientist or psychologist will tell you drawn out lectures mute their original intentions and may even spark rebellion to spite the original message. Hopefully Moore would not conciously want to turn off potential supporters.;Why use two hours to say America's gun approach is bad??
179;456.0;4.0;5.0;"In 2002, the outspoken filmmaker Michael Moore directed, wrote, produced and starred in a controversial documentary entitled ""Bowling for Columbine"".  The film focuses not only upon the very tragic Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in 1999, but also upon many Americans' predilection for gun ownership and gun violence.  The film begins with an animated narrative about American history that begins to introduce the reasons that Michael Moore attributes to the very large amount of gun violence that exists within the U.S.  As Michael Moore thoughtfully points out, of all industrialized nations in the world today, the U.S. is the leader in the number of victims of gun violence with more than 11,000 deaths in 2001.  Conversely, Australia's number of gun violence victims for the same year was less than 40. (Several other nations' statistics are also shown, all much lower than the U.S., including neighboring Canada, France and England.)\nAs Moore focuses on the two teenaged boys that committed the Columbine massacre, he points out the interesting coincidence that Moore grew up in Minnesota near where one of the boys had also lived for several years.  It was also the home to Charleton Heston, who is and has been the president of the National Rifle Association, as well as the location where the men who were convicted of being the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombers were involved with a local militia.  Moore interviews current militia members, John Nichols (brother of one the Oklahoma City bombers, Terry Nichols) and Charleton Heston.  He also interviews several of the Columbine massacre victims and Matt Stone, a former Columbine High School graduate, who is also one of the creators of the very popular animated TV series ""South Park"", which was modeled on the city of Columbine. Columbine's primary employer is Lockheed-Martin, which Michael Moore visits during the film.  Other interesting people that Moore interviews include rock-star Marilyn Manson and Dick Clark.  Moore also uses a lot of archive footage of various people and events.\nMichael Moore does present his case admirably for the causes of gun violence in the U.S. in ""Bowling for Columbine"", but sometimes his interviewing techniques are inappropriate and some of his information may be inaccurate.  Overall, however, because of the amount of information that Moore does provide that makes people think, I rate ""Bowling for Columbine"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  Not everyone who watches the documentary will agree with Michael Moore's conclusions or techniques, but the message about the amount of gun violence in the U.S. is something that cannot be ignored.  Hopefully, it will encourage adult gun owners to take all the necessary precautions for owning guns, and also encourage parents to make sure that they know what their children are doing, especially if the children have access to guns.";"""out in a little town in Colorado, two boys went bowling"""
187;457.0;5.0;5.0;"This film is full of interesting interviews, no matter how you feel about Michael Moore. The truth is sometimes unpleasant, but Moore does not shy away from it. He really does a good job of displaying American's schizo attitude towards guns and violence in society.\n  My jaw hit the floor when Moore focused his attention toward Marilyn Manson; resulting in some of the most articulate and insightful statements about contemporary society from a person that I have heard in a long time. No kidding.\nThis is a very important and entertaining film.";Even-handed portrayal of American Society
189;458.0;5.0;5.0;"Michael Moore, the American movie maker and author of many high-class books, released a documentation on school massacres and their causes in 2002. Although often criticized, this controversial movie  which is called ""Bowling for Columbine"" got rewarded as the best film in its genre at the Cannes Film Festival.\nMoore does not only present real footage and interviews. He is also trying to make the American audience realize, why there is such an increase of violence in their society. By covering the aspects of gun control or political issues, Moore's intention is to mainly bring up the culture of fear, which is created nowadays. He also explains who or what keeps this culture preserved.\nThe movie basically is an enumeration of TV Ads for the NRA, speeches of politics, family members of the victims, and different communities in American villages, where took place. It is very clever to use pro and con strategies to leave the audience the decision what to believe. For example Moore uses crosscuts of Charleton Heston and a victim's father, both holding speeches.\nWhile using professional editing of camera shots, he also managed it to accessorize the movie with special music, which allows the viewer's mood of irony to increase steadily. Armstrong's ""What a wonderful world"" is a leitmotif during the whole production and is usually shown during short cuts following one another very quick, showing war scenes.\nAnother important interview he presented, showed a conversation with the mostly feared rockstar Marilyn Manson.  He himself was one of the victims that was called guilty for influencing the boys from Columbine due to commit their brutal crime. Being a fan of him for a long time, it does not surprise me to see him stating his opinion in a decent way. I've always thought that he is a very intelligent individual.\nWhen Moore talks about the media, he certainly is appealing to the modern culture of fear which is mostly created by TV channels, radio stations and of course the internet.\nAmerican news media shows 600% more negative material than it used to, although the crime rate is constantly decreasing. Therefore most people get scared easily, regardless what true statistics prove.\nI personally liked the movie a lot and to me it was one of the best documentaries I've ever seen concerning usual documentaries only show what happened at the high schools and just a few, like Moore, try to figure out why school massacres happen or why American Society is so panic.  Without making it a real serious and depressing movie, Micheal Moore states his opinion and tries to make the audience realize how we could change things and to think about solutions for the issue. Although it was ""just"" a documentary, which usually is not my genre, I went through any emotion there is, while watching it. Sadness, fear, shock, fun, and the end impression I had was that Moore, the famous movie maker and author, allowed me to sympathize with his main opinion: We the people, and only us can change the cruelty that is taking over everywhere on this planet, 24/7. I share his point of view completely and state it once again by one of my most favorite quotes regarding society by Charles Horton Cooley :""Our individual lives cannot, generally, be works of art unless the social order is also.""";American Society: an immortal Culture of Fear
197;459.0;5.0;5.0;"Contrary to the average description of the movie, BFC is more about fear than guns. Guns are used as the vehicle to ask the question: why are we so afraid? Michael Moore brings up the interesting point; Americans seem to be a nation full of fear. This can't be argued, especially after our reaction to 911. Why does Canada have more guns per capita than America, but far fewer murders? Why do they feel safe enough to keep there doors unlocked in a big multi-cultural city like Toronto? These are just a few of the questions asked in this excellent look at our culture, and what makes us who we are. I'd ask anyone who watches this movie to do so with an open mind... Republicans who can't see past their anti-liberal rhetoric need not apply.";This Movie Is Not About Guns!
200;460.0;4.0;5.0;"In Brief\nIs America a nation of gun nuts or are they just nuts?  This is the question that the press release for Bowling for Columbine asks us and Michael Moore's new film goes some way in exploring.  Taking the Columbine High School shootings as its focal point, this documentary looks at the aftershock this massacre has had, paralleling it with the gun culture and increasing violence seen both within the States at a domestic level & the murderous events perpetrated by said country on a world level.\nReview\nDirector, writer, celebrity, political activist, comedian; this is Michael Moore's first documentary film in 13 years since his debut Roger & Me, and it saw its premiere this Sunday as part of the Regus London Film Festival.\nSince making his first film his political stunt style has developed through his television shows, The Awful Truth & TV Nation and his status as both celebrity and man of the people has been perpetuated through his written work: the most notable being his recent book Stupid White Men, which has been on the New York Times best seller list for over nine weeks!  This was despite his publishers best efforts to make sure it never saw a bookshelf let alone made money and is a testament to the strength of his work that it is now in its 19th printing.\nSo while Moore is obviously a draw, especially to a disillusioned youth or general public, why does Bowling work so well?  The answer is simple, it is honest film making - and his greatest tool is the truth which can be delivered in laugh out loud ""its so scary you have to laugh"" moments, which are equally surrounded by poignant seriously sad & intense segments that depict the awful state of affairs the States has found itself in.\nFrom satirising American history through a farcical cartoon, that ironically makes sense, to looking at the FBI checklist of what is a potential teenage time bomb: Are you a depressed teenager?  Do you wear black, feel alienated, use inappropriate humour, abuse drugs or alcohol?  Any of that fit - maybe you could make some headlines next!  His humour is pure genius, and this is an entertaining film that doesn't feel dry and won't leave you looking at your watch!\nThis however is not a film that will purely get a ripple of laughter and fill some seats in a cinema, it forces its audience to question itself.  Indeed, it works well outside of the States as it makes you ask where our own country is going and how long will it be before we reach the level of public disturbance that is witnessed in the USA here.  In 1871, the KKK was made illegal, a few months later a new organisation was formed calling itself the National Rifle Association (NRA), its purpose was to promote gun ownership to whites only.  Until the 1950's the gun was used to keep so-called free blacks in their place, now it's the right of every citizen to carry arms.  America was once an open prairie of wild expanse, an individual needed then to protect themselves, some say that it is still wild but now a different sort of jungle.  Times change and Bowling for Columbine addresses the current `status quo' well, but it is up to the public address what is to be done today.\nThe Verdict\nCreating a nice narrative progression that works well in a cinema - this film does seem to have an entertaining beginning middle and even a climax.  But being based in reality there is no end that can be said without being done and one man cannot do that alone.  It dares to ask questions that others have yet to put to a mainstream audience but in comparison to his written work, you feel that Moore is pulling his punches in order to make this product just that little bit more commercially appealing.  Nevertheless this is another fantastic film that should not be missed from the auteur that excels in exposing American absurdity.";A DANGEROUS DOC
202;461.0;4.0;5.0;"When Michael Moore asks Charlton Heston near the end of this documentary why there are so many more killings in the U. S. than practically anywhere else on earth, he responds at first by saying we have always been a nation of blood, a nation of violence. He then opines that it's because we are a nation of ""diverse ethnicity."" He had previously said in the interview that he keeps a loaded gun in his gated estate because of the Second Amendment and if it was good enough for the ""white"" men who founded this country, it's good enough for him. I believe that qualifies as undiluted racism. Moore interviews Heston and several others, some for and others against the easy access in this country to guns and ammunition. What I found amazing about this movie is that so many people spoke so openly when they knew they were being filmed. On the other hand, that's no more amazing than what ordinary Americans reveal about themselves on late night TV shows.\nMoore asks  other hard questions--for example, about the welfare-to-work program that forces a single mother to travel 80 miles one way each day to work two minimum wage jobs that don't provide her with enough income to pay her rent. This is the same mom whose six-year-old son finds his uncle's gun, takes the gun to school in Flint, Michigan and shoots another six-year-old. Moore also takes on corporate greed, the news media's obsession with violent crimes as well as the zigzag approach the United States government has taken to various dictators over the years.\nI do not know if seeing this movie will make people change their minds about guns and killing in this country or not. I do know that this documentary is very troubling.";A Troubling Documentary
203;462.0;5.0;5.0;This is a fascinating and disturbing look at gun violence in the United States, using the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, as a starting point.  There are places where Moore's biases come through loud & clear, but at most points in the film, Moore creates questions rather than prescribes cures.  I was expecting a film-length pitch for gun control, but the film delivered something very different.  I'm not sure what Moore's thesis is -- but the question posed is why does the United States have such horrific statistics on shooting homicides?  The statistics are alarming -- our statistics are orders of magnitude greater than those of other developed countries.  According to the film, Canada, England, & Germany have virtually no gun homicides, while the US has over 11000 a year (and in Canada, about 70% of homes have a gun).  Moore doesn't give pat answers -- violence on TV, our propensity towward military intervention abroad, heightened coverage of violence in news media that creates a culture of fear, exposure to guns at a young age, the proximity of missile-producing Lockheed Martin to Columbine, poverty -- who knows why American society is so violent??  Apparently, the Columbine shooters were enrolled in a Bowling phys ed class & went bowling on the morning of the shootings -- Moore sarcastically questions why bowling isn't blamed as a cause of the shootings.  Moore even explores a situation in which a six-year old boy shot & killed a classmate at his elementary school in Michigan, leading him to interview bus passengers on the bus ridden by the young shooter's mother, leading in turn to a pointed criticism of Michigan's welfare to work program.\nMuch about this film is disturbing --  footage of the shootings at Columbine, footage of executions in US-sanctioned military and police actions throughout history made me squirm.  And I was very uncomfortable during Moore's confrontations with K-Mart (who sold the ammunication used at Columbine), Charlton Heston (for his visit to Denver with the NRA shortly after the Columbine shootings), and Dick Clark (whom moore attempted to interview because the six-year-old shooter's mother was employed at a Dick Clark's Bandstand restaurant under Michigan's welfare-to-work program -- seems to stray a little off point). Moore comes off looking slightly annoying, but the film is a real eye-opener and well worth seeing, regardless of your position on Moore, the Second Amendment, and gun ownership.;meandering but thought-provoking look at gun violence in US
209;463.0;3.0;5.0;"Americans have not seemed more politically polarized in my lifetime than now. It seems like all our current concerns have come to a boiling head. Over it all wafts the smoke of the World Trade Center.\nThis shadow hasn't blanketed controversy. We stir it in with everything that made us mad before. Some interesting works result.\nMichael Moore's 2002 film *Bowling for Columbine* exemplifies the current mix of argument. Controversial in his own right, Moore examines modern American violence in a sort of cross-country adventure. And now his vision is available in a special edition DVD from MGM Home Entertainment.\nShine the Ball\nMGM's release provides plenty of extra pieces to peruse. The transfer and sound brings justice to Moore's journey about the lack of justice. Special features include Moore criticizing Republicans for attacking former President Clinton instead of preventing the September 11th attacks. Viewers also get to hear people lower on the filmmaking ladder provide a commentary; Moore's interns mostly provide little stories like being locked inside Charlton Heston's estate. The case insert is your standard scene selection card.\nStrike\nDespite its titular reference to the 1999 Columbine High School tragedy, *Bowling for Columbine* is not about school shootings. And despite its byline, ""Are we a nation of gun nuts or are we just nuts?"", it's not about guns. Instead, Moore launches a methodical attack against corporate conceit and social inequity, which he repeatedly implies are the sources of violence in America.\nTrue, Moore discusses guns in detail at first. For example, he interviews a relative of Timothy McVeigh about guns, and he examines not only the Columbine tragedy, but another infamous incident in Michigan, when a preschool boy shot a preschool girl. But Moore's gun interviews lead into an analysis of Canada, a nation with plenty of private firearms but a fraction of the violence. His Columbine interviews lead to discussion of the major defense industries located right in Littleton, Colorado. And his visit to Michigan concludes with a memorable confrontation with Dick Clark, one of several celebrities who use ""Welfare to Work"" for menial labor-including the mother of the aforementioned boy.\nMoore's implied concern against corporations and conservative government continue with brief examinations of the September 11th terror attacks, America's own history of terrorism, and America's fear-instilling media. Moore breaks his theme only in the final five scenes, when he tacks on a dramatic but contradictory attack against guns.\nRules of the Game\n*Bowling for Columbine* passes as a documentary. To me, a documentary is a visual research report. Documentaries provide information, but do not pass judgment and do not draw conclusions. The Vietnam War film *Hearts and Minds* exemplifies a great documentary.\nThroughout most of *BfC*, Moore implies his opinions. He's obviously critical of conservatives, but he simply gives them rope to hang themselves.  But in the last 20 minutes of the film, Moore advances an explicit argument, a specific solution, and he passes out judgment like a cop passing out tickets on Memorial Day Weekend. These attributes convert Bowling for Columbine from an informative exposition to a persuasive-policy exposition, and the latter is not a documentary!\nGutter Shot\nThis doesn't spoil my enjoyment of *BfC*. Unfortunately, its ending does. After spending the film dealing in ambiguity and complexity, Moore suddenly decides that gun control is the answer after all. Besides contradicting much of his film, Moore's final Act befits tabloid journalism.\nMoore parades Columbine survivors to pressure K-Mart into banning handgun ammunition from their inventory. The group even buys as much ammunition as they can, ostensibly so nobody else can get it. Once K-mart caves in, Moore tells reporters he is doing his part to reduce gun violence. This K-Mart scene suggests that targeting guns will reduce violence, contradicting his own point that nations like Canada are heavily armed but experience relatively low death rates.\nIt also explains why I couldn't buy ammunition when I was stationed in El Centro, CA. Kmart and Wal-Mart were the only game in town; I and every other police officer in the area had to scrounge for enough ammunition to properly train for our jobs. I don't know if banning ammunition from Kmart saved lives, but it sure interfered with civilian and federal law enforcement training.\nAfter this segment, Moore confronts NRA president Charlton Heston in the film's climax. At first, Moore seems reasonable. Then he attacks Heston's pride with increasingly inflammatory questions. Heston walks out after Moore indirectly insults him. Moore pursues Heston and, in perhaps the most tactless scene of the movie, goads the aging president with a picture of the preschool shooting victim.\nFinally, Moore concludes with an ominous implication of continued gun violence, playing right into the fear-based media he disparaged not an hour before.\nI'm sure it's exciting to see the hip young liberal chase the mean old Republicans away. Such emotional provocations doubtlessly sealed Moore's Oscar award. To me, the K-Mart and Heston confrontations inflated Moore's reputation, while contradicting his own film and punishing non-criminals. The shock value of his climax might make his movie memorable, but also dishonest.\nEnd Score\nMoore's ambiguity had me in the palm of his hand for most of the film. I'm pleased he built his film on interview and news clips, showing instead of lecturing. Most of the film works, and it works best when Moore puts institutions on the spot.\nBut he lost his grip in the end, when he witnessed to the gun control choir. In doing so, Moore banks into the same gutter that traps most of America's post 9/11/01 media. He preaches a party-line and pushes others away.\n*Bowling for Columbine* often strikes. But it will ultimately split people who should be working together. That Moore should slip like this so late in an otherwise excellent film is too frustrating to articulate.";Bowling Over Republicans

244;466.0;5.0;5.0;Michael Moore's valid study of the Columbine High School tragedy and our country's obsession with firearms is the best film of 2002. A thought provoking and moving analogy on the state of our world in the crisis of violence, isolation, unemployment, gun control, and terrorism. Moore and company look at both sides of the issue and Moore an avid hunter and member of the NRA questions the president of the organization Charlton Heston on the true intentions of his cause. Hopefully one day these problems can be overcome until then I praise directors like Moore for addressing the issues.;Bowling for brilliance

254;468.0;5.0;5.0;Having been a freshman in High School in Denver when the shootings at Columbine occurred, I'd like to thank Michael Moore for making me remember and cry.  There has been a lot of criticism of Moore for playing fast and loose with the facts, but as a student in Colorado at the time, I personally remember the events of Columbine in a deeply personal way.  I am not anti-gun, I've been shooting since I was nine, and my dad was a member of the NRA before Charlton Heston's insensitve and morally corrupt decision to come to Denver and have his effing rally.  Whatever criticism you may have of Moore, his facts regarding the Columbine Shooting are dead on.  I had friends at Columbine.  And while I fully believe we have the right to carry a gun, I also believe we have a moral obligation as human beings to let a community grieve without attempting to use people's sorrow to further our own ends, which is exactly what Charlton Heston did.  I don't care how you vote, but this is a damn good movie about an extremely tragic occurrence, and if Moore did a damn good job.;Criticism of the Critics
255;469.0;3.0;5.0;This documentry would have been more interesting if instead of going to Canada and comparing American gun crimes to Canadian's, Moore had instead made comparisons of gun crimes of different American cities and towns. Why is the gun crime rate in Washington D.C and Gary Indiana higher than it is in some other similar sized cities,or why is it lower in others?\nAlso,I thought it would have been interesting for Moore to have  gone to inner city areas that are known for gang violence with guns like Los Angeles,Chicago or Detroit and talk to gang members there about why they keep getting guns to do their violence? He could have interviewed some Crips and Bloods while he was in South Central L.A.;Would Have Been Interesting If...
256;470.0;3.0;5.0;Let me just start by saying that I don't, personally, think BFC comes anywhere close to the underappreciated brilliance Moore showed with 'Roger and Me.'  I really got the impression that 'Roger' was a much more personal movie for Moore, whereas I saw a lot more ego showing through in BFC.\nLet me lay down a few things first:\n1.  I TOTALLY believe that a LOT of facts about the NRA's actions, post-Columbine, were intentionally distorted.\n2.  I KNOW a lot of facts about Lockheed-Martin were flat-out wrong.\nThat said, it's skewed presentation of the facts almost completely kills the works credibility, and that's terrible because it raises a LOT of really interesting points about our society when compared to other countries and their problems (or lack there of) with violent crime.\nMoore just seemed to be all over the place with this one, seemingly so desperate to find someone to blame that he can't seem to find his finger to point fast enough.;Interesting, but definitely distorted
260;471.0;5.0;5.0;"After attempting to read 'Stupid White Men' in its entirety, I was skeptical about watching 'Bowling for Columbine' to say the least. The former had made me think that Moore really didn't have much of a point, but the film, having just watched it, helped me gain respect for what he had to say. Plus, now that I see how extreme the reviews about the movie are (most of them being either 1 or 5 stars), I feel my gut confirmed that there's something important that he's trying to say, and I for one, want to listen to it.\nThis documentary is long (some 2 hours) but it needs to be so: the issue presented has multiple dimensions and Moore is very effective in their presentation. Bringing back terrible memories from Columbine HS shooting and the killing of a 6-year old by a classmate in Flint, MI, Moore ponders once and again why (all other things being equal) would the US have such a high gunshot death rate, compared to all other first world nations. My first thought, when I saw the figures that he presented (US having 11,127 gunshot deaths in a year, compared to Japan's 39 or Canada's 165), was that he was not being fair, since he was leaving out the country's population. Well, taking the time to compute how many persons per million get shot to death in all the countries he compared the US against (consulting population figures in the CIA factbook online), it turns out that this number is 7.48 times higher in the US than its nearest 'gunshot death rate' neighbor (Canada) and a striking 127 times higher than Japan's 0.30 persons per million killed by a gun in a year's time. So his point is still clearly valid!\n""All other things being equal"", as I said before, is very broad, yet he tackled on most issues I can think of, when comparing the US with other countries in terms of possible causes for how violent we are: history of violence (think Germany and WWII, Britain and massacres in India), amount of guns owned (in Canada, almost 70% of the families own guns), violent movies or violent games (global broadcasting, display and sales of these make them available equally to audiences everywhere -indeed, the point can be made that a large number of violent video games come from Japan, where the issue is nowhere as critical), etc.\n(spoilers ahead, if you don't mind them)\nGranted that something is wrong when a 6-year old shoot another one in school, after discarding alternate hypothesis and interviewing people ranging from pro-gun control activists to NRA's very own Charlton Heston (no comment on him...) Moore comes to the conclusion (one that I particularly agree with) that we, as a society, are being bred in a culture of fear: the media feed us with the most absurd stories day in, day out, which put the fear in us, though some law enforcement officers argue that crime numbers have actually gone down, which results in an escalade of gun and bullet purchasing. This unfortunately is not helped by the 2+ year-long stand of the US in its battle against terrorism, with frequent terror alerts and attacks on Afghanistan and Irak taking place, since more and more people end up fearing that the terrible tragedy of September 11 could strike them close to home soon.\n(end of spoilers)\nWhere does he want to go with his work ultimately? God only knows. We'll have to see what he brings back in 2004 when he releases his next movie, right before the election. But one thing is for sure: most likely you will have a hard time seeing things in the same way after you see this movie.";Made me gain respect for what he had to say

280;473.0;4.0;5.0;"The controversy surrounding Michael Moore's Academy Award acceptance speech for this film, sadly overshadowed one of the most moving, and thought-provoking films to come along in quite some time.\nI went into this movie, not exactly knowing what to expect. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comic take on a serious topic, or a serious look at what's wrong with the whole gun-control issue in the US. What i found, was a combination of the two. And the fact that he pulls both off, is a feat in itself.\nOne minute, ""Bowling For Columbine"", had me laughing over his deadpan sarcastic humor, and the next...i had chills, watching the actual footage from inside Columbine on the day of the shooting. I think one of the best things about the film, is you don't know where it's going next. Michael Moore keeps you guessing, which is one of the reasons it's such an effecting movie.\nMy advice is to look past the controversy, and experience a movie that will make you think...no matter what your position is on the issue of gun control. and it will definitiely stay with you for a long time.";Making a statement...the Michael Moore way
286;474.0;5.0;5.0;"There are many people who criticize this movie, but it's not afraid to tell it like it really is.  This movie pains a lot of individuals cause of the subject matter it deals with, and many would like to turn a blind eye to it.  Well, time to open your eyes, America.  Though, for some reason, even though Moore makes stirring films, it's a shame that it basically has changed nothing.  The public at large has already been brainwashed, and most forget once they leave the theater or turn off the telly that there is a world of hurt out there, and Moore is trying to turn a mirror on OUR society and say, here's the problem.  I hate to make analogies, but this film reminds me of that commercial where the fella is talking about quitting gambling, and the camera pulls back to reveal that it's him talking to himself in the mirror.  America, for the most part, loves to watch violence, myself certainly not being excluded, yet we do nothing to stop it, for the most part.  When we hear about it, we say what a shame, yet on the outside our actions don't reflect how most of us really feel deep down inside.  It's a conflict of interest to most.  Most would prefer to lock their doors and shut out the world, and Mr. Moore hits the nail right on the head with that one.  Most don't realize the world of hurt until it comes crashing down into their own worlds.  Violence and tragedy affect everyone, everywhere.  There's not much we can do, but we can change how we deal with one another, and that's a step.  Okay, so the DVD offers some great extras including Moore relating how he felt the night he gave his ""infamous?"" Oscar speech.  An intelligent, thought provoking film for EVERYONE, and whether you want to accept that or not remains to be seen.";Great work

303;478.0;2.0;5.0;"Admittedly, in our society, there is nothing criminally wrong about being a hyper-leftist focused on advancing one's agenda.  Michael Moore, a college drop out, decided to create a film exploring the ""root"" causes of the Columbine disaster, which exploits to advance a political agenda he held before the crime occured.  The irony is that Michael Moore provides ample evidence a nation of ""gun nuts"" (his term, not mine) is not to blame for the Columbine disaster.  For instance, he admits that Canadians have lots of guns, and, considering their low murder rate, that is not to blame for the high murders in America.  Thus, it is a bit of irony that he tried to pick on Charlton Heston, president of the NRA, a man who was just trying to have a nice conversation with an apparent ""reporter.""  Michael Moore's apparent conclusion as to why murder rates occur in the United States has to do with a lack of socialism--""free health care""--in the U.S.\nIf Moore wanted to seriously consider the gun argument, he would have called John Lott Jr., author of ""More Guns, Less Crime.""  He is an articulate spokesman for the notion that more guns will result in less crime due to the way criminals use incentives to control their behavior.\nMichael Moore also makes many irrelevant connections between items that have absolutely no connection to other items.  Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, is apparently near the Columbine High School site.  So?  Moore brings up this connection without providing one single shred of evidence that one is connected to the other.  He thinks that by saying a defense contractor is near the school that it will result in one thinking that defense contractor sites encourage children to kill.  In fact, they do not.  If that were the case, we would at least see national statistics suggesting that such correlations exist.  I'm sure Michael Moore would be happy to show them.  But he did not.";A Fictional Documentary with Slipshod Evidence

Unlike most people, I'm not that familiar with MM's previous work (with the exception of the tame ""Canadian Bacon"", his attempt at a comedic satire) and I was mostly oblivious to the hype surrounding this film.

I had little interest in ""Bowling for Columbine"".\nAfter watching this film, I truly regret not seeing it when it was in the theatres. This is great stuff, people. Whether you love or hate Michael Moore, ""get"" the point of this documentary (a lot of people won't), once you start watching this, you can't stop. Highlights?\nThe interview with Marilyn Manson. He comes across as intelligent and articulate. He really should consider running for Congress once he's done making crappy music.\nThe interview in Charlton Heston's pool room. Chuck seems amiable, courteous and a bit misinformed until Mike asks him why he hosted an NRA convention in the town where that little girl was shot.\nThe scene at K-Mart. ""Returning the Merchandise."" Wonderful stuff. I had tears in my eyes.\nThe security cam footage from Columbine. If you can sit through that without wincing and you're American, you've been desensitized by a media that thrives and feeds on fear.\nAnd in that regard, a primary message of ""Bowling for Columbine"" is sadly and unreputably true.\nEverybody should watch this movie.

360;481.0;5.0;5.0;"This is not another dull, dry discussion regarding the issue of guns and gun ownership in America.  Moore has an axe to grind (or ammunition to load?) and he does it with a style all his own.  If you treasure the cliche of ""if guns are made illegal, then only criminals will have guns"" then you might as lessen your likelihood of suffering a stroke and buy a ticket to the next Charlton Heston Film Festival.  But if it you seek a different viewpoint, one presented with wry and cynical humor, invest in this movie.  You won't be disappointed.\nWho ever thought that the far-right militias could provide such humor?  And how about the bank that doubles as a - fully licensed - gun distributor?  Michael Moore will never be accused of being too subtle, but he does provide a great amount of entertainment while expounding on his admittedly liberal bias.  When this film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, he unabashedly used his 30 seconds of air time to propagate those views even further.\nThe title of Bowling for Columbine refers to the two teenage killers who allegedly went bowling on the morning of their massacre at the Colorado high school.  Moore has been criticized by some for his use of video from a security camera at Columbine on that day, however I think that these images are presented with respect and in the proper context.\nYes he does attempt a few ambush interviews, with mixed results.  Dick Clark basically drives away, K-Mart's public relations people provide a surprise and Charlton Heston manages to salvage some dignity while surrendering no ground whatsoever.  Other highlights include an examination of the different attitudes regarding guns as held by Americans and Canadians, the aforementioned bank with it's guns-as-giveaways promotion, and the Miss Militia calendar.\nMoore uses statistics that sometimes beg for more explanation and source accreditation, but then again few people or organizations with positions on gun ownership and legislation do.  Where Michael excels is in the areas of providing entertainment and raising questions.  He may not always provide satisfying answers, but he'll certainly make you think!";Give us more Michael!

421;487.0;4.0;5.0;"In the tradition of ""Roger & Me"" and his two TV series, Michael Moore uses his amazing editing skills to produce a polemical film filled with an astounding amount of irony. I am in awe of his virtuosic editing. The sheer emotional impact of his editing can't be denied. But decision making should be based on more than just emotions. No one can mistake this for an even handed, objective documentary. This is clearly propaganda. To achieve its goal, propaganda doesn't care about facts. It cares about emotions. To sway our emotions, Moore once again relies on his old technique of twisting the truth. Ignored facts, facts out of order, and sometimes outright lies. Many important facts from the pro-gun side are left out: the Founding Fathers' writings, the huge number of people who have defended themselves using guns, and the huge rise in crime rates in countries that have disarmed their citizens. Moore ponders the reason for the high murder rate in the U. S., but never really finds the answer. The best he can offer is a cynically amusing cartoon. As a flaming liberal who is also very pro-gun, I can recommend every Moore production except this one (and ""Canadian Bacon,"" which was just plain lousy). But from a purely cinematic viewpiont, I can't recommend this highly enough. Yes, I'm torn. I certainly hope people will base their final decision on the gun issue on more than this biased, emotional movie. I hope they'll be more dispassionate and get all the facts on both sides. Moore spins an emotionally compelling story, but not the full story. As a Michigan Militia member in the movie asked, ""Who's going to protect you? The cops? the government?"" To his discredit, Moore never deals with the fact that the obvious answer to that question is ""Neither.""";Still the master of irony

Heston hoist himself on his own petard by letting the kindly old gun worshiper ramble, stumble and smile until finally in low dudgeon he escapes from himself, by walking off the set.  But then, in another scene,  Michael can't shut up - he keeps yakking at Dick Clark, who is unable to get the door of his  van closed fast enough when he discovers what he is up against here.

425;490.0;5.0;5.0;These conservatives are the funniet lot we have in this country.  Seriously.  This film was brilliant, it did not in any way take the anti gun route that these people say it did.  I will agree that some of it was kinda slow, I wanted moore action (pun intended).  That is the problem with these people, they seem so afraid to watch or hear anything that they disagree with because they are afraid to possibly change their minds or lean another way, but followers will always be followers, not leaders.  Mr. Moore showed us that he actually favors the right to bear arms, if you actually watched this movie then you know that is true, but that we actually seem more hell bent on causing destruction. ...;NOTICE:  most negative reviews were after the Oscars, True.
446;491.0;5.0;5.0;The main theme behind this movie is not that guns should be banned, as some knee jerk reactionaries may have reviewed this movie as being. The point, at least as far as I can tell, that Moore is trying to convey is that fear is the cause of our gun problem. he points out the number of gun owners in canada is actually extremely high, thus discounting a correlation between gun ownership and death. It's this fear that's installed deeply into American culture, especially that of many whites in this country towards of african americans, which Moore illustrates very clearly. Overall, I think this movie dispenses a great amount of right wing propaganda that has spread like a virus thanks to this fear culture Moore discusses. Definitely pick this up if you see the theif in chief as a vile threat to your freedom and well being. An important piece of modern day cinema.;Actually, For the Thinkers In My Opinion
450;492.0;5.0;5.0;"I'm not going to waste your time with a diatribe 12 pages long about what I liked or didn't like about the film.  This is just a brief opinion on my take of this documentary.  I found it to be the most enjoyable and thought-provoking documentary I've seen in a long time.  I don't care whether he agrees with my personal philosphies or not, this is a good film that moves at a nice pace.\nThe essence of the movie is NOT about gun control or gun violence. Michael Moore is trying to examine a hugely complex issue, which is why America is so violent?\nI won't insult by telling you how to think or feel when you watch it.  Is it accurate? Don't listen to these other ""viewers"" who try to tell you what the facts are. Research it yourself.";Must See Documentary
463;493.0;5.0;5.0;Michael Moore's documentary on American gun culture, in all its facets, aims at a lot of big targets, misses some of them but fires rightly at most of them.\nThroughout the film, it poses question after question to the audience, yet it never steps wrongly enough to say that there's one answer to all the problems involving guns and gun violence in the nation.\nMore than a bit biased and wicked, of course, Moore creates a film that is pretty much hysterical, yet it challenges its audience to ask when, how and why the United States is alone in its problems with guns.;One of the best films of the year.
464;494.0;3.0;5.0;"This documentary, compiled by a nerd-ish yet (controversially) brilliant gentleman named Michael Moore II, has its share of pros and cons, both of which shall be addressed in the this review.\nThe cons: few, but powerful. First, the five minute ""American History"" animated blur, though highly entertaining and well written, is nothing more than a barrage of wildly misinformed and over-exaggerated stabs at western culture. Offending me is a feat that precious few people are capable of, but the fact that many people who have seen this film actually take this trite as fact is, to me, repugnant. I won't go into any further details, what with the 1,000 word limit and all.\nSecond, I'll jump on the con bandwagon and say that Moore's interview with Charlton Heston was cruel and pointless. How old is the poor guy? Seventy-something? He has alzheimers too, which I'm sure Moore was aware of. Despicable.\nThe third a con is more of a set of mildly annoying items thereof, such as the exchange between Moore and Heston towards the end of the film, in which ol' C.H. is beckoned to look at a picture of a young girl he supposedly helped to dispose of by supporting the NRA (the exchange keeps switching between two angles which would be impossible to execute without the cameramen seeing each other). Obviously fake. Other little things as well, such as Moore discussing how there's plenty of racial diversity in Canada (in an attempt to disprove that gun violence in America is caused by blacks) as he walks through different Canadian cities and stops for a brief interview with a black man FROM DETROIT. Way to prove your point, Mikey.\nThe pros: this film is hilarious. Plain and simple. The ""funny"" boasted in this film is neither of the ""ha-ha"" nor the ""ho-ho"" ilk, but rather of a rare, awkward, almost uncomfortable kind not found in many films. Moore's interviews are mastefully conducted, filmed, etc. Marilyn Manson's interview in particular is (suprisingly) very insightful. He's got a lot of brilliant ideas and he's not afraid to shove them in the face of his opponents.\nOverall, because the funny parts slightly outweigh the stupid, annoying, and otherwise outright WRONG parts (and because there's no two-and-a-half star rating) I will recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a comprehensive, well organized, and oftentimes very entertaining look at the American culture's insatiable connection with guns.";Mixed opinion
469;495.0;5.0;5.0;"Words almost fail to describe the impact this movie.  Bowling for Columbine is depressing and satirical, with its numerous interviews with gun/weapons fanatics.  It also has two extremely powerful sections, one debating the number of gun deaths per year in other ""civilized"" countries (and each country's history of violence), the other showing the US's violent tendencies and support of terrorism, ending with a more frightening clip of the plane crashing into the second World Trade Tower.  If you ever wanted an excuse to hate Dick Clark or reeeeeally hate Charlton Heston, or just want to think, go see this movie.";Stellar
475;496.0;5.0;5.0;this film is amazing. i hold it in such high regard, i am not certain of my ability to justify it with words. it made corporate america (k-mart, wal-mart, dick clark, lockheed martin) out to be the monster that it really is. michael moore shows how stupid the point of some pro-gun activists is, while proving what a horrible person a figurehead of the pro-gun movement is. it explores the misfocused media in america, and the fear of just about everything experienced by the american\npublic. i don't know how michael moore puts all this into two hours, which go from incredibly depressing, to disturbingly hilarious, to just plain hilarious. given, this movie could do more to get into the heads of pro-gun militants, and people on the other side ,but these people are usually so close minded and blinded by republican, right wing america, that its virtually useless to try to appeal to them. i loved this movie, michael moore is a genius, and deserves all the praise he can get.;an attack on evil and stupidity
483;497.0;4.0;5.0;"Michael Moore's latest is engaging cinema, to say the least. His sarcastic, ultra-liberal approach to ""the awful truths"" of America have never been so entertaining. It's a cross between Candid Camera and 60 Minutes.\nThis time, he confronts the gun-culture of America. He highlights the fact that Charleton Heston and his merry band of pro-gun extremists held a rally near Columbine shortly after the tragedy there. Then, he and his ilk held ANOTHER gun-rally shortly after another child/gun tragedy in Flint, MI where a 6-year old child shot and killed a 6-year old classmate (Heston claims in the final interview of the film that he didn't know this had just happened when he appeared in Flint). Heston really shines when he claims that the reason for all of the violence in America is due to ""mixed ethnicity"". This statement is almost as jaw-dropping as Bob Eubanks' anti-semetic joke in Moore's debut, ""Roger & Me"", unless of course, you are a bigot.\nAlso interviewed, and similarly pathetic, is James Nichols, brother of Terry Nichols and friend of Timothy McVeigh, both convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing. James, of course, is pro-gun, but doesn't believe the right to bear arms includes nuclear weapons (""There are a lot of nuts out there,"" he claims, to the howling delight of the audience).\nMarilyn Manson pops up also, commenting on how he was also blamed for Columbine because the idiots that killed at Columbine listened to his music.\nAnother highlight is when Michael invites two Columbine survivors to join him at the K-mart headquarters in Troy, MI, to ""return the bullets"" that are still embedded in their flesh from the Columbine attack (reportedly purchased from the local K-mart). This stunt results in K-mart's announcement that they will be pulling ammunition off of their shelves, to Moore's own astonishment.\nAlthough there is a lot of serious business in the movie, it is packaged with enough laugh-out-loud footage to make it bearable, even entertaining, even in light of the constant barrage of violence played out on nightly newscasts.\nThe only major downside is Moore's lack of thoroughness in certain areas. For instance, he claims Canada has as many guns as we do in America, and therefore the death-by-gun rate should be the same (of course Canada has FAR fewer gun-related deaths than the U.S.). However, Canada bans handgun ownership. This is not pointed out.\nAlso, he tries to blame Michigan's ""Welfare to Work"" program for the classroom shooting of the 6-year old child, his claim being that because the mother of the shooter had to work far from home (via bussing), she had to leave her children in the care of her brother, who owned the gun that the child found and brought to school. This is a stretch, as when he also blames General Motors for this tragedy, inferring that it was because GM ruined Flint, MI that this tragedy occured. These tangents, although interesting, often seem somewhat scattershot.\nThere are other flaws as well, and many will depend on your viewpoint, but no matter what you think about Michael Moore or gun control, this movie is funny, thought-provoking and will stick with you awhile.";Flawed but hilarious
488;498.0;4.0;5.0;"Moore is more in this outrageously funny documentary.  A little over 2 hours, ""Bowling for Coumbine"" lampoons America's love of the gun.  Moore's comic book style fits the gallows humor and is easy on the audience.\nThe movie is not subtle; but the issues are.  Through interviews, action videos, cartoons, and stills, Moore underlines Charlton Heston's assessment (given late in the movie in a particularly pathetic interview) that ""the US is a violent nation.""\nTowards the middle of the movie, Moore ventures into Canada to discover surprisingly that Canada is also awash in guns.  However, the number of gun-related homicides and suicides is negligible, measured on any scale.  There must be something else afoot here.\nThe something else, it is suggested, is fear.  Canadians don't lock their doors, and anecdotally at least, do not feel afraid. Americans do.\nMoore explores the historical view.  We are largely the sons and daughters of northcentral European outcasts, who descended from the  murderous tribes that eventually became England, Germany, Holland, France, Serbia, and so on.  Looking for religious freedom in the new land, they brought with them their swords, guns, and Bibles.  Then, with Biblical ferocity, they murdered millions of Indians, enslaved millions of Africans and western islanders, and slaughtered several hundred thousand of their own in less than 200 years.  The rest as they say is history.\nViolence begets violence and violence begets fear.  Every violent man knows that the next man is also violent and so lives in fear.  Thus, blacks fear whites, whites fear blacks, the rich fear the poor, who fear the rich, and so on.  Under these conditions, it would be downright insane not take up arms to protect ourselves from each other.  This we have done.  And, as President Bush has told us recently, it is important to fire first.\nThe solvent in which this brew ferments is, in fact, the country itself.  Lockheed Martin, who builds missiles in Littleton, Colorado, the home of the Columbine massacre, is at the center of the film.  Moore interviews its company spokesman on the floor of a Lockheed Martin weapons plant and asks: Is there any similarity between the Columbine murders and our use and sale of weapons of mass destruction overseas?\nThe viewer is asked to sort this out.  I say shrug it off. Rather, see the movie again, like you would consult a cartoon that tickles your funny bone.  ""Bowling for Columbine"" is a howl.";In Search Of
498;499.0;5.0;5.0;I saw this film at the Mill Valley Film Festival with my wife.\nWe both walked out of the film with a feeling of lightness. It was as if someone finally said something that we knew, but were unable to express adequately in words.\nI did not see this as being a movie against guns. To me it was about the excesses that can come from stirring up false fear and hatred. If truth has the power to make us free, we sometimes have to see the truth even if it is unpleasant. The greatness of this film is in the inescapable clarity of it's message.;Wow, this is a mind blower

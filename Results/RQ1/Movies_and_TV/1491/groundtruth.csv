I was told that the military, by the direction of the ""highest authority in the Department of Defense"", will not allow this movie to be shown in or on any military base regardless of popularity. So, I rate it with 50 stars, representing our country, our flag, our national pride, to beg the American people to regain the freedom that our forefathers fought and died for.

1272;3.0;3.0;186.0;"I had high expectations for this film. Winner of the prestigious Palm d'or at Cannes. Widely praised, even begrudgingly so by some reviewers from a traditionally right wing perspective. Good word of mouth from some fellow reviewers for whom I have great respect. Too bad it didn't really deliver.\nI give it a middle of the road rating, because I found the film about half enjoyable. It's very well edited and generally moves at an excellent pace. There are some truly funny bits, especially the montages of Bush and his cabinet getting made up for various televesion appearances. Attorney General Ashcroft serenading the faithful is not to be missed. The usual assortment of Bushisms and the now infamous 7 minute scene of The Commander in Chief sitting with the kiddies after being informed of the second tower being hit. Moore hits the mark there.\nAt other times, he misses the target completely. The segment in the ice cream truck was funny for about ten seconds, then nada. The bushwacking (pardon the pun) of the Republican Congressmen outside the capital was simply a concept whose outcome was predetermined. That Moore actually got any politician from the right to stop and speak to him speaks well only of those who were brave enough to engage him. It was a cloyingly empty exercise on his part. Which strikes to the heart of the matter of my problem with Moore. True, he acknowledges his bias, as if that alone were enough to get him off the hook in regards to presenting us with a ""realistic"" viewpoint. I don't expect objectivity from a documentary filmmaker, but I do expect a slightly less corrupted presentation. For instance, when he first inteviews the mom in Flint, MI who acts as a thread for his anti-war stance, it's obvious that she doesn't know of Moore's muckraking history. He basically nods in agreement when she delivers her views about the military and how proud she is of her family's collective contribution to the Armed Forces. He doesn't give her any hint that he has a hidden agenda. Then later in the film, he comes very close to exploiting the poor woman when she learns that her only son has been killed in Iraq. Moore has become infamous for this tactic (playing both sides of the fence, as when he pretended to be a gun lover in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE).\nI also don't think Moore is half so funny or clever as he thinks he is. One half hour of THE DAILY SHOW with John Stewart delivers more laughs and more finely wrought political satire than does two hours here.\nThere are definitely quite a few things that Moore gets right, however. The slow motion photography of the rain of paper after the collapse of the twin towers was very moving, as was the accompanying soundtrack. The brutal, graphic war footage is something every voting American should see. Many won't want to and never will, but there is no way one can idealize the carnage of war after viewing those images.\nOn the whole, Moore does succeed in his indictement of the Bush administration and its single minded pursuit of regime change in Iraq at any cost. I can't say that he taught me anything I didn't already know before. I was hoping he would. Thus the disappointment. I still say it is a film that people should see, if only as a reminder of how far politics has sunk in this new millenium.\nBEK";A Bit Disappointing
751;4.0;5.0;165.0;"When Michael Moore delivered his controversial acceptance speech after winning the Best Documentary prize for Bowling for Columbine at the 2003 Academy Awards, he lashed out at President George W. Bush and the fictious war in Iraq. Little did anyone know but Moore was also offering a teaser of his next film, Fahrenheit 9/11, a scathing attack on Bush, his link to the rich Saudi oil families, the ""War on Terror"" and the war currently raging in Iraq.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of Moore's documentary is that he puts a human face on the citizens of Iraq-something that the mainstream U.S. media has failed to do. He shows graphic footage of dead and maimed civilians killed by U.S. bombs and soldiers. He lets them speak and it becomes readily evident why many Iraqis hate America so much and why the mission to liberate them has so far failed. Moore also gives the U.S. soldiers a voice, interviewing several serving in Iraq and how some are clearly tired of fighting for people who don't want them there. Some soldiers who have come back home are also featured and they talk about their experiences and how their view of the war has changed. Moore also shows how the deaths of American soldiers have devastated their families with one woman in particular, Lila Lipscomb, whose story is quite compelling and resonates on a deeply emotional level.\n\n""Release of Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an 11-minute featurette on the film's reception at the Cannes Film Festival. There is also footage of long line-ups and sold out screenings as the film made its way through the country.\n\n""Eyewitness Account from Samarra, Iraq"" is an eyewitness account by Swedish journalist Urban Hamid on a U.S.-led raid in Samarra. There is incredible footage of U.S. soldiers arresting a man accused of funding insurgents that is narrated by Hamid himself.\n\n""Lila Lipscomb at Washington, D.C. Premiere"" features comments from the woman that Moore talked with in the documentary and whose son died in Iraq. She delivers an impassioned speech at the film's premiere.\n\nFinally, there are seven additional scenes of footage, including interviews with more average Iraqis on the streets of Baghdad on the eve of the 2003 U.S. invasion. Also included is more with Corporal Abdul Henderson and his experiences in Iraq and a very funny segment with Arab-American comedians doing routines about the ""War on Terror"" and how they are persecuted on a daily basis.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 is an incendiary zeitgeist movie that taps right into what is currently happening on our political landscape. It is an angry blast, a howling protest movie against a Presidency clearly out of touch with what is really going on. It is a brilliant film for these troubled times and is what every American, be they Democrat, Republican or undecided, should see before they vote in November.";A movie every American should see before they vote!
1213;5.0;5.0;142.0;I was prepared to be critical of this sell-out film. I?ve seen Michael Moore's other films and I know he distorts things to his own agenda. He seems to be a bit of a bully. And I don?t like the fact that he?s going around the world bad-mouthing America.\n\nYet, I'm concerned about the future of my beloved country. I sense deeply that George Bush and his administration have messed things up. There has to be a change in leadership. And this intrusive filmmaker looks like a catalyst to make that happen.\n\nMr. Moore knows his craft well. He knows how to select just the perfect film clips that will make his subject look ridiculous. His background music makes us laugh. And his voice-over commentary is cutting and sarcastic. There are also images of horror, such as the victims of war with devastating wounds. He?s kind to the American soldiers though. They?re victims too and we meet the double amputees who are languishing in hospitals and not getting their proper benefits.\n\nThe central theme of the film, however, is the tremendous wealth that the Bush family and other corporate executives are acquiring because of their ties to the Saudis. He makes our country look like a war machine with nothing but profits on its mind. Mr. Moore has first-hand experience the result of corporate greed in his hometown of Flint Michigan as he illustrated many years ago in his film ?Roger and Me?. And, indeed, he returns to Flint again in this film. Here, like other depressed area of the country, the military is a way out of poverty. We meet a woman whose son is in Iraq. She?s a proud American and even flies an American flag outside her family?s modest house every single day. Some time during the filming, her son is killed. The war now become up close and personal as we all share her grief.\n\nI did expect this film would manipulate my emotions. I wanted to resist and watch the film from a point of rationality. That was impossible though. I got caught up in the frenzy of Mr. Moore?s mission, which is to bring down the Bush administration. And at the end of the film I was applauding loudly with the rest of the audience.\n\nI know that this film had a hard time getting released and this just adds to the hype and publicity about it. And, in a way it is truly an American story. Because only in America would anyone dare to do this kind of hatchet job on the President. In other countries, Mr. Moore would have had his tongue cut out, or worse.\n\nThis is an important film. See it. Think about it. Talk about it. And understand.\n\nHighly recommended. Don?t miss it.;An important film to see, think about and talk about
875;6.0;5.0;122.0;"There are many memorable images in Farenheit 9/11, Bush reading ""my pet goat"" after the second plane hit, the wailing Iraqi mother who lost her family, Gore and Deniro partying after the Democrats short lived win - but the one that really sticks in my mind and manages to sums it all up succinctly is the elderly woman at the bingo hall who saw through the tainted slant of the media and the ever shifting reasons for invading Iraq and exclaims with toal contempt ""we were duped""! Its an epiphany many of us are waking up to now, thanks to a fat white guy who currently happens to be more dispised by the religious right then Marylyn Manson or Anton Levay.\n\nTo hear it from the naysayers, Michael Moore stands in front of a camera for 2 hours launching vicious slander against righteous George. The truth of the matter is we almost never see Moore, Bush himself is the ""star"" of Fanrenheit 9/11 and whatever opinion the audience ends up drawing, it is based on Bush's own words and actions. The religious right has us so transfixed we find ourselves saying things like ""even if the movie is only 90% true..."" Well i went through the exhaustive reference material available on [...] and every assertion, every statement has been published somewhere before in the mainstream media based on traceable data. Unfortunately with just 5 guys controlling this information an article about the White house flying the Bin Laden family back to Saudi Arabia where 15 of the hijackers originated came from quickly dissapears from print and funnily enough is NOT the lead story on FOX news, I wonder why.\n\nMoore plays his cards just right, I have watched this film with several groups of republican voters and fundamentalist Christians who would typically vote for George the anti-choice pro descrimination conservative. When Lila Liscombe reads the final letter from her son before he died serving in Iraq she breaks down in the point of his letter ""Thank you for the Bible"". It suddenly begins to dawn on these conservatives that Bush and his republican cohorts have behaved in a decidedly Un-Christian way in sending thousands of innocent men and women to unnecessary deaths, while Osama Bin Forgotton. I have watched every single Christian conservative melt like an ice cube thorugh this section of the film, indeed anyone without a heart of stone could not help but be touched by the Liscombe family. My female friends weep and the men sit in stunned silence ""Im flaberghasted"" is all one could manage at the conclusion.\n\nThis is as heavy handed as the film will get, the documentary itself is incredible not just from the content but in that we almost have a new doco genre here ""tragi-comedy"". What we witness in Farenheit 9/11 makes you angry enough to jump out of your seat and enrole to vote (even when you live on the other side of the world like me), it makes you want to weep at the injustice, all while you cannot help but laugh a hysterical laugh at the complete absurdity and stupidity we ourselves remain responsible for. I can not imagine a more important film being released this decade.\n\nPs If you think Michael is in it for the money he is losing millions in DVD sales to rush the release and attempt to have the film shown free on TV. He withdrew his nomination for best documentary Oscar on the chance a network will screen the film before the Election. I have a new American hero";"""We were duped"""
673;7.0;4.0;97.0;Firstly, I am not from the US.  It seems to have become a hobby of Americans to wear their politics rather vocally on their sleeves. Looking up info about his film, if you're any kind of regular net-surfer, you will likely have seen verbal volleys directed back and forth between democratic supporters and republican supporters.  What ends up happening is the equivalent of an elementary school name-calling contest rather than any discussion of the film as is.  Yes, there are parts of this movie presented out of context.  One example:  When the Taliban visit Texas in this film, they were there by invitation from the Clinton administration, even though Bush is Texas governor.  However, what works in this film is seeing a result of one presidential administration's decisions (and indecisions in one almost tragically comical scene) and its effects on people in two countries.  The interspersal of Lila Lipscomb's patriotism to outrage to utter sadness are the most moving parts of this film.  Seeing the effects of the war on those who were on the front lines and discovering what is never mentioned on US newscasts is a powerful series of images.  The interviews with shell-shocked, amputee soldiers in rehab are frightening to behold, knowing that there are what is nearing 10,000 of these men returning to the USA, and to what kind of reception?  Seeing Moore on the streets of DC telling members of congress to sign their adult children up for military service is hilarious to watch, especially seeing the reactions of the congressmen.\n\nFor me, all of these changes in mood, from disbelief, to horror, to unbounded laughter are what make this a 4 star film.  Taking it in context of just a theater goer, and not a potential voter, make me agree with why this film won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Festival.  There are powerful messages here, despite personal politics and should be seen by anyone who is a citizen of this planet, not just the US.;A film that brings out the best and worst in reviewers.
5;8.0;5.0;95.0;One of Moore's chief accusations is Bush allowed planes to pick up 24 members of the Bin Laden family and fly them out of the US in the days following the attacks - when all other aircraft were grounded. To back this up, he shows a document that seems to list them - and uses it as a base from which to explore the relationships between the Bush and Bin Laden dynasties.\nWhen Bush was trying to make his way as a Texan oil magnate, this same man was hired by the Bin Ladens to invest their money in Texas, and he in turn invested money in Bush's company, the film says.\nMoore asserts that prominent Saudis invested in Bush's ailing companies to get access to his father, the former US president. But aside from the original military records, there is little proof to firm up links Moore goes on to make.\nThe result is the oil and arms companies the Saudis invested in, and the Bush family and their inner circle have interests in, profited from the aftermath of 11 September, Moore says. Using a clip of former US head of counter-terrorism Richard Clarke talking about how Bush immediately wanted to find an Iraq link to the attacks, the film moves on to Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThe Afghanistan section - including a screen shot of a BBC News Online story - is a claim that the military action in Afghanistan was really about laying a natural gas pipeline across the country.\nBut the Iraq section is more substantial, and changes the film's direction - using interviews with US soldiers, footage of civilian suffering and highly moving testimony from bereaved parents of US servicemen.\nThe film shows graphic footage of corpses of US soldiers being burnt, dragged behind a truck and strung up, and a scene of US soldiers apparently mistreating Iraqi prisoners.(...);Anti-Bush film tops Cannes awards
0;9.0;5.0;85.0;"I have read allot of reviews that were posted here.  And I have to agree with all the positive ones as apposed to thoughtless and arrogant single star ones.\nThere is no reason to attack someone based on the way they look.  I am not a democrat myself, though I hate the way conservative right wingers attack others who they don't agree with, by throwing  personal remarks for example a ""fat bustard"" and so on.\nLet's put things into perspective.  I have watched Bowling for Columbine and I have to say that this was the most eye opening documentary ever.  Why?  Well because I love America, I support our troops, but our government does whatever the hell they want to.  Our media shows only one side and never the other.\nI have afforded a great opportunity to see this movie and it was excellent.  Many will still say that Mike Moore lives in a dream, by all means let them, since 9/11 we all have been living a nightmare\nI encourage everyone to see this movie and read the books such as ""Dude where is my country""\nIt is not propaganda, is it a knife poke into the Bush's administration, I would think so.  Does he deserve it.... This is only my feeling but the answer is YES.";At least someone is telling the truth
1440;10.0;4.0;84.0;Let me just acknowledge my disinterest in the movies of Michael Moore in general. I usually go to see movies for entertainment and although he is entertaining his subject matter usually isn't escapism so I generally avoid his movies. I actually only saw one other movie by him, Roger and Me, and that was years ago. What interested me in this movie was a NPR interview that discussed both its merits and downfalls, the interview intrigued me and so I was compelled to get advanced tickets and stand in line to see the movie!\nThis movie covers a lot of ground so at times you wonder what are we talking about now and then he meanders back to his point of view. Let's not forget this is a movie based on Michael Moores point of view no matter how many people share it. The movie has been called a documentary but it's not filmed like a documentary most people are used too. There is just too much ground to cover. So the film does have merit it's chocked full of facts that are disturbing about the Bush family and their connection with the Saudi's, contradictory interviews of Bush and his cabinet, and personal insights from a select number of Americans.\nI enjoyed the film it was humorous but at times hard to watch. The movie begins with the idea that the last four years was a dream but in essence a nightmare for Mr. Moore. This movie has validity I just wish Mr. Moore didn't hate President Bush so much. The movie certainly makes light of President Bush's ability as President and Leader of the Free World. Perhaps this movie would be embraced by the Republican's if Mr. Moore had stuck to just the facts and not immersed the film with his personal dislike of President Bush and therefore the controversy emerges.\nAll in all the facts in this movie are incredibly disturbing! Even if you don't believe everything the movie tells you it makes you think about the dispersion of information by the media, the lack of leadership among the Democrats, the motivations of the current White House, and the distinct class distinction in America Today.\nAs for the movie making, like I said there were a couple of times I wondered where this was going but Mr. Moore redirects often and takes you through the maze and back out and you say to yourself, WOW I never thought of that. This movie although not a classic documentary it does make you think and want to find out the truth whether you share Mr. Moores truth or not. It is, thank God, America!\ngirldiver:) Proud to be an American!;Keep on Rockin' in the Free World!
1258;11.0;5.0;81.0;Tears streamed down my face almost all the way\nthrough this film. could the story be sadder or more clearly presented? This band of out of touch and untouchable neo-cons have hi-jacked our country and wasted our beautiful and trusting children. They have moved this great country away from all that we stand for...Michael Moore may be ham handed but his movie speaks to the deepest part of who we are. We have the vote, we are obligated to use it...every one of us. I am seventy years old and there has never been a more important election in my memory.;This film broke my heart.
1140;12.0;5.0;79.0;"its funny how most people say that this was a bit over hyped but according to the 9/11 commission report the facts are there..\n\n The September 11 Commission's 567-page final report has confirmed key facts presented in Fahrenheit 9/11. These include:\n\n Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265\n\n After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, he went ahead with his classroom event.

Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 557, n. 28.\n\n White House former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke approved these flights. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329.\n\n It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including:\n\n What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly were the flights arranged by the U.S. government?\n\n Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: ""At a time when 14 of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections.""\n\n Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew of Osama bin Laden, who ""was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth"" (WAMY), which the FBI has described as ""a suspected terrorist organization,"" and that the bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that ""has been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps traveling with President Bush.""";The truth hurts at times

1135;14.0;5.0;76.0;I'm sure that the people who say that this movie is full of lies probably don't know this FACT.  They just listen to hate mongers like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and don't bother doing the simplest of research on the internet that any child is capable of. Go to his website for a line by line affirmation of Moore's running commentary with sources listed.  It was combed through by fact checkers for New Yorker Magazine and by three lawyers.  It is legally true which means it is well within the bounds of Fox News and CNN.\n\n  Oh, by the way it's an excellent film, with many clips that you won't see elsewhere.  There is footage of the news, of government documents, of average folks, and in Iraq.

552;15.0;5.0;71.0;"I had a sociology professor ask my class that question on our first day in college.  The class fumbled along, attempting to please him with their answers.  ""When you're able to repeat it."" one said.  ""When you can use it to understand other concepts,"" was another response.  I want to address the fundamental controversy behind Fahrenheit 9/11 using this very question I was asked back in college.  The fundamental controversy behind this film, is that it portrays our government as motivated by the potential to make huge profits at the expense of innocent lives.  The innuendo boldly set forth by Michael Moore is that we invaded Iraq to gain strategic control of the Mid-East oil supply. Moore outlines this point very well: he shows Hamid Karzai, a Bush connection from his oil company days being appointed leader of Afghanistan, and shows how shortly thereafter a pipeline began to be built in that country.  These are facts. If you watch the special features to this DVD, (and I hope you did) than you saw the lengthy interview with former Marine Abdul Henderson, who told Michael Moore that their first duty in Iraq was to secure the oil supply, and then go about ""liberating"" the country.\n\nWhy is it hard for the film's detractors to accept that our government is greedy and disingenuous? We all know we were told this war was to find WMDs, but it only takes a little research to see what the bigger picture is.\n\nSo I return to my original point.  How do you know something? How do we as Americans know the government invaded Iraq for control of the second largest oil supply in the world? For some people, they would only know it if President Bush admitted it in a state of the union address.\n\nIt's time to be active Americans.  We can't rely on the spin that we get from the White House.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good first step for a lot of people to wake up to what's going on.  If documentaries are your thing, there's a whole slew of them that deal with these kinds of issues coming out. Hijacking Catastrophe is one that I will see this week.  If you're angry after seeing Fahrenheit 9/11, (at the content, not the presentation) then I stand with you.  We know what's going on because all the pieces are adding up...";How do you know something?
1384;16.0;5.0;66.0;"This is the first time I've ever reviewed a movie.\nSeeing Fahrenheit 9/11 reminded me of my reaction to looking at the concentration camp films of what the Nazis did in World War II.  When I looked at those films, I wondered what was wrong with the Germans who went along with such atrocities.\nWatching this movie made me feel guilty that our country had done so much harm to innocent people around the world in our apparently misguided efforts to locate Saudi-Arabian led Al Qaeda terrorists.  Now I wonder what's wrong with me for allowing this to happen.\nI hope you will look at the movie and make your own judgment about what each of us needs to do.  I know that I need to begin to speak out and write against the self-serving nonsense that we are being fed from Washington, D.C.  If you want to know more background about the Iraq War please see Bob Woodward's book ""Plan of Attack"" and Michael Moore's book, ""Dude, Where's My Country.""\nIf you have read ""Dude, Where's My Country,"" you may feel that you know what's in this movie. I had read that book, too, and expected few surprises at the movie.  But Mr. Moore has updated his research and information quite a lot since the book was written.  What he added really floored me.\nAs I read in the New York Times this morning that a military draft reinstatement is just around the corner, I realized that unless we stop our attacks on other countries and our search for oil and military profits we will doom hundreds of thousands of other young people to go through what just happened in Iraq . . . as well as millions of innocent civilians around the world.\nLet's start acting like Americans again.  We're not sheep who can be led around by those who have hidden political and personal agendas.";This Documentary Made Me Feel Overwhelmed with Guilt
1120;17.0;5.0;65.0;Bravo to Michael Moore for producing a courageously honest AND entertaining movie.  Don't listen to critics, just see it for yourself.;Bravo!
1249;18.0;4.0;63.0;"This film is a brilliantly-contrived and choreographed emotional roller coaster ride that incites a quite palpable resulting attitude of disgust, dismay, and disdain on the of the viewer. Mr. Moore manipulates the images, voice-overs and antics to both amuse and outrage us all at once, in an obviously outrageously satirical (and sometimes hysterical) look at the war in Iraq and the people who engineered us into invading that country, at terrible cost to ordinary American men and women.\nIn essence that is the simple message of this pseudo-documentary; that simple, trusting and basically honorable young and patriotic Americans are being badly abused and misled  by an administration and a government out of control, a government which, in Mr. Moore's view of the world, serves its people up to slaughter without worry and care. After all, it is not, as he so comically and memorably demonstrates, the sons and daughters of the governing elite who serve and die in God-forsaken places like Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThus, in one chaotic series of vignettes, Moore corners unsuspecting Congressmen and makes a pitch to have them volunteer their kids as potential cannon-fodder for Iraq. Needless to say, the point is well taken, as only one current member of Congress has a son stationed in harm's way in Iraq. He counter-poses such banal images with those of battle casualties and struggling working class mothers crying over their lost sons after the fact. One must hasten to acknowledge that in fact, Michael Moore makes no pretense in the film of attempting to be balanced or fair; on the contrary, he is puzzled by the suggestion that he do so.\nAfter all, as he says, the opinions coming from the environs of the Oval Office have hardly been balanced or fair.  And while one may argue that he has sometimes played fast and loose with the sequences of events, or the connections between various elements tied together in the movie, there are few outright falsehoods one can point to as an example of downright misrepresentation.\nHe also quite cleverly puts the lie to the idea that protest or argument is somehow unpatriotic. This places an enormous burden on those who would argue one must remain silent in solidarity with the troops as a show of respect for their sacrifice. Yet it is hard to argue with Moore's logic that anyone who really cares about the welfare of the troops would take care not to misuse them or continue to place them needlessly or carelessly in harms' way. As James Bovard contends in his new book, suggesting, as Mr. Bush does continually, that by fighting the terrorists in Iraq we will avoid fighting them here, is at best an almost criminally nave notion, and at worst, a cynical and murderous misrepresentation of what is going down in Iraq.\nWe are not becessarily there to preserve their freedom or ours, argues Mr. Moore, and any suggestion that such is the case will have a hard time explaining events that now transpire on an almost daily basis. Moore's intent was to ratchet up debate on the policies and practices and rationale of the neo-conservative regime current in power, and to suggest that perhaps Americans begin to question it and its motives much more closely. Thus, despite it dramatic excesses or its willingness to sometimes take liberties in connecting things which may or may not indeed be so tied, I believe in creating public controversy and stirring public debate the movie will be a stunning success, and that it may well lead to having some measurable resulting political impact on the election in the fall.

I wondered why they would push the Act that destroys so much of our privacy, and our rights in the name of 'security'.  That was the beginning of my research.\n\nI started to realize things were not as they seemed.  As I watched Bush, I started to see his faults, his unbelievable ignorance and certainty which can be seen by any footage of him, but more specifically in the recent debates with Kerry (9/30/04).\n\nI began to see his lack of diplomacy and realized after talking with my Indian friends at work how much the world really hates us, because of our policies and our [lack of] diplomacy.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was mind-boggling to me, I wondered why  would we involve ourselves in such a thing?  My ignorance at the time didn't tell me about the the massive oil reserves in Iraq.\n\nWhich is clearly the plan.\n\nSince 2001 I notice Bush constantly talking about terrorism and I realized that it sounds a lot like fear mongering after a while.  I admit I was duped too, I felt very afraid for a long time after 9/11.  Not saying we are safe from terrorism, because there could be more terrorist attacks.  Mainly because of our foreign policies and their affect (read Chomsky's Hegemony of Survival).\n\nBush has pushed me so far to the left it's ridiculous.  Keep in mind I have a deep distrust of the democrats in power as well.  As Chomsky says, the two party system is deeply connected to huge corporations and their interests.\n\nAs for the movie, yes, it is opinionated and political, but it is also rooted in fact.  I knew a lot about the movie before I saw it from reading/news etc.  So much of it was NOT a surprise to me.  The movie is excellent, and I have to seriously question anyone that says Moore is not a patriot of the highest degree.\n\nThe day that the Moore's of the world are silenced is a very frightening day indeed.  Rush Limbaugh gets to speak every day, and so does Moore.  One should hear both sides, then watch the news (more than 1 source), then listen to foreign news, then make decisions.\n\nThe movie is a must see.  I have learned to look at all points of view before making decisions.  Look at actions of the politicians not their words.\n\nThe movie shows a human face to the war- what it's really like.  Not 1 life is worth a single barrel of oil.  And you can see that millions of lives are affected by this need for oil.  We won't talk about ridding ourselves of oil dependency.  Hmmm... I wonder why?\n\nThe movie is enlightening (for those that don't do their research other than political ads on tv), but I strongly urge everyone to see this movie, read the patriot act, try to understand it.  Take a close look at Bush and understand how scary it is the way our government treats other people.  Look at Guantanomo bay prisoners and their treatment.  Are they innocent or not?  They are being held illegally, and without representation.  What if Ashcroft decides to do that to you or me?  If they don't follow the rules there, why would they follow them here.\n\nIn the movie, there is a scene where the soldiers break down the door of a home, and come in to arrest some guy, and they hold everyone at gunpoint.  This is especially scary, because it shows a use of force that is blatant and random.  And it can very well be in your own doorstep some day.  I've seen it.\n\nCelebrate the Moore's of this country!  See the movie!;I voted for Bush in 2000, BIG MISTAKE
1129;20.0;5.0;61.0;Michael Moore has said he made Fahrenheit 9/11 to force Americans to discuss the invasion of Iraq, and the greater war on terrorism, both of which which he felt had been rubber-stamped by Congress and rushed past the American people.\n\nIt is impossible to argue that he has not reached that goal. If nothing else, note that there are nearly 700 reviews of this DVD on Amazon two months before it is to be released.\n\nWhether or not you agree with Moore's politics, you have to agree that he makes powerful films. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 in the theater about a month after it's release, when the Bush administration had had plenty of time to do all they could to discredit Moore and his film. The audience by then was small, but they CHEERED at the end of the movie.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 may be the best finger-in-the-eye-of-the-powerful you will ever see. It's also great film making.;Straight Outta Flint
1004;21.0;4.0;58.0;"From the reviews I've read so far it's obvious to see how polarized views on this film -and current American discourse for that matter- are. Yet it is hard to talk about it without revealing one's own feelings about the war.\n\nOverall the film was well done, both in content and structure. And contrary to what the reviews written here by the right-wing sympathizers  (consisting usually of one paragraph and saying nothing substantive about the movie-just ad hominem attacks against Moore) there are no lies in this movie. Moore himself has said he thought about offering $10,000 to anyone who finds anything factually wrong in it, yet some in the right love to bash it. Ironic, since the reasons this administration used for taking the US to war have been proven inaccurate -to say the least-, but the ""Party of Self-Responsibility"" does not seem to admit to them. I'm willing to bet that most of these reviewers who give the movie one star have not even watched it.\n\nWhat the movie contains however, is a string of selective facts that Moore can be very manipulative in using. A good example is the footage of Iraqi civilians on the eve of the war; children flying kites, happy families,  followed by... the attacks. This is followed by scenes of mayhem and death, and one particularly heartbreaking scene of a bloody baby wailing while being carried to a hospital (that scene still haunts me). This was an undeniable part of the war, this really happened, and Moore elicits from the audience the response he intended. Yet as I watched this, I thought that if instead of those scenes he had chosen footage of Saddam's\n torture houses, children being tortured in front of their parents, wives being raped in front of their husbands and children, then the response to the bombing from the audience would have been a very different one. This was part of the war too.\n\nFurther, while I believe there was foul play in the 2000 elections, I would not go as far as Moore. And seriously, can anyone say with a straight face that the last name Bush HAD NOTHING TO DO with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of junior? Yet Moore builds up this case in a way that makes it seem as a watertight conspiracy theory, when in reality it was many people, at many levels of government, putting aside objectivity and integrity and ruling out on partisan allegiance, not unlike a struggling democracy elsewhere. Moore does show an amazing amount of papers and concrete proof to base his argument on, but again, one is left feeling that it could not be so ""perfect"" as Moore would have you believe.\n\nThe documentary does articulate the outrage of many people who feel we were taken to war for dubious reasons, and then it turned out that those reasons were downright wrong. Right now American credibility around the world is zero, and half the people in this country feel the same way about the Bush administration. Moore's intention with this movie is to keep Bush for winning office again, which is in my view a necessary step for our own survival and to signal the rest of the world that this country does not approve of the lies we have been fed. If re-elected, we will be seen as co-conspirators and American reputation will sink even deeper. Although this reader needs no convincing, Moore's film makes the case even more persuasive.\nIn the end if Michael Moore hates America or not only he must know; but raising a mirror to America's face is probably the most patriotic you can do right now.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 ends with a thought that should be given nothing but respect and approval from the audience; ""Our young men and women put themselves on the line and ask that we only put them in harm's way when absolutely necessary."" How some people can say they agree while at the same time still support what Bush has done -all evidence against him- is to live a contradiction. Yes, Saddam Hussein was the scum of the earth and his sons and cronies were no better, but this was not our war to fight. If the reasons for taking us to war were to ""bring the gift of freedom from the Almighty"" to Iraq or oil or strategic security or whatever, accusations of WMDs and imaginary links to al quaeda do not justify it. That the people who did everything possible not to serve in uniform when it was their duty, are the ones who now so carelessly take us to war, is nothing less than a tragedy.";Worth Watching
670;22.0;5.0;57.0;This really is a very well done film.  Everyone should watch it, both with an open mind, but also critically.  What struck me more than anything was the way that some of the kids fighting in our armed forces today (and I mean kids -- 18-19 year olds) seem so inadequately prepared by the system to psychologically deal with the horrors of war and what it is they're called to do.  The character formation of some combatants (though certainly not all) seemed to be based on having grown up playing shoot-'em-up video games.  It seems as though our military needs to do a hell of a lot more to overwrite this very harmful mentality.;Shows a different side
1149;23.0;5.0;55.0;I spend far too much time reading the news online, especially the foreign press, so I wasn't shocked or suprised by the film.  In fact, I was very moved by it in many ways.  I felt frustrated that the American people choose to overlook so much and give our trust so freely.  You can't dispute the footage - It's real.  Bush's actual documented actions do more to undermine his credibility than Michael Moore ever could make up.  One thing that can't be disputed, Michael Moore is a TRUE PATRIOT, his love for America shines through!;The Truth is Hard to Handle
1147;24.0;5.0;54.0;I find it humorous that people in this forum seem to be reviewing their own political positions and purposes rather than going into or after the film itself which is the real state of grace here.  Michael is an excellent documentarian, perhaps the best today, with a more historically bent nod to the Burns brothers (sic) and a few others.  He is a great one because he wakes people up and gets them to display thoughts and emotions, while many of these films just make us grab for some more popcorn, change the channel, or nod off.  And almost all of Moore's films have made us think and feel STRONGLY (Roger and Columbine especially).\n\nAs a documentary junkie I have never seen anything perform the effect that Fahrenheit 911 has and does.  It is the cattle prod for the polarization of America today and seems to be getting more and more defined as we move towards November.  Well so be it.  Whether you are a Bush monger or a Kerry cutie this is a movie that needs to be seen.  You decide for yourself whether its purpose is propaganda, entertainment or to overthrow the world in a nicer way than Dick Cheney (corporate takeover) or even John Edwards (legal eagle) ever thought possible.\n\nI was so disappointed in a recent New York Daily News or Post cover story (can't remember which but they're pretty much the same, right?) when 911 Tragedy standard bearer Rudy Giuliani (I voted for him) blasted this film, sizzled Moore and went on to say he never saw it.  What!?!?  Siskel and Ebert moment ala Rudy: I loved the film Gene.  I hated it Roger, you're an idiot.  Why?  Don't know, never saw it.  Sounds like my Robin Hood book report in the 4th grade.  Skipped the book, watched the cartoon, wrote a parody (got an A+).\n\nWhat is everyone so afraid of?  Changing sides, a firmer position, not having the best hairdo?  Maybe Mr.  Moore should make a documentary about THAT.  But Rudy should stay out of that race for sure.\n\n-Joshua Leland Evans (bald as well);biased?

The film clips of this guy popping his gums (in his own words), all lies?  The fact that this war, was the wrong war at the wrong time?  These are indefensible facts and occurances.

Well:\n\n1. Flawed. Michael Moore throws a lot of stuff out onto the carpet that is suggestive, but doesn't go anywhere, like the stuff about the Saudi royals (""Bandar Bush"", anybody?).\n\n2.

580;29.0;5.0;51.0;This was a very painful film to watch because of the bubble that was burst by it.  I always believed my government was always right.  Always upholding truth and honor.  The good against the bad. But now I see a government can be only pure and truthful as the men and women we elect to represent us.  Our politicians both Democrat and Republican are out of touch with Americans.  Both have speeches that play on both sides of our emotion in order to get us to support their greed.  This film replaces the missing media that this country needed during a time of pain and loss.  The media was complacent and allowed the truth to be surpressed and the opposing views to be smothered in the name of greed and appeasement.  Mr. Moore's film gives what real reportive journalism is like and allows us, the people, to decide what we wish to believe or not.  Not the spinmeisters or news talking heads that represent their corporate media bosses.  Thanks Mr. Moore and keep up the tough reporting.;An Amazing Work of Art

594;32.0;5.0;50.0;"Michael Moore obviously can't stand George W. Bush, and goes out of his way to make him look bad in this film, but making him look bad doesn't seem to take much of an effort.\n\nThe most amazing part of the movie was the film of the president sitting in a classroom, listening to kids read a story, when one of his aides told him the country was under attack.  He sat there for seven minutes, frozen, before getting up to do something about the attacks.\n\nWe always hear about the ""liberal media"" in this country, but if the media is so liberal why didn't we ever see his failure to react to the news until this movie came out?

A few of the points Moore makes in the film include:\n\n1.  There was no reason to go to war with Iraq.\n\n2.  Only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.\n\n3.  Most of the soldiers are from poor areas like Flint, Michigan\n\n  where there are no other jobs.\n\n4.  The Homeland Security Act makes very little sense.\n\n5.  The greed of companies like Haliburton is disturbing.  They\n\n  are the big winners in this war.\n\nOf course if you back Bush, you'll say the film is totally biased and a waste of time, so you probably won't want to bother with it.

1138;33.0;5.0;48.0;"This movie does have something of a spin to it. I think most mature American voters are quite capable of discounting the spin and addressing the issues raised, which are important ones; the movie may or may not influence their votes. I found much of what was shown extremely interesting and worth looking for more information about. Other parts of the film I discounted as hyperbole resulting from a passion against a certain political viewpoint.\n\n But, although the film does have its own slant, it has never been claimed to be more than one man's view of events; it should be understood as such. And any critic who says that in this free country a person expressing a different political view from his own is a traitor has a very distorted view of what the United States is supposed to be about. Mr. Moore has put forward his entry into the ""free marketplace of ideas."" People of different views have done the same, and some of them also have opinions of interest. Truly, it is possible for people of honor to be loyal and well-intentioned, yet still to hold different ideas about the policies that would govern this country best.

To those who rant that this documentary is propaganda and anti-Bush, let me remind you that Mr. Moore uses network and archived footage aired nationally and internationally - there's no Hollywood staging. He is also practicing his civil liberties and Constitutional rights to criticize an administration that is violating those rights. The very rights that, supposedly, Bush paid lip service to when selling and fooling America into thinking that we needed to free the Iraquis and save us from the gloom and doom that would fall upon us ""any day now"" unless we got rid of Saddam.\nMr. Moore's use of network news footage is brilliant and disturbing at the same time. It was very telling to see and hear some of our troops high on adrenalin rush, stating how ""cool"" it was to shoot 'em up while listening to loud music CDs inside the tanks - then later get their sobering statements after witnessing the damage they had done to innocent Iraqis. This, in itself, was worth watching.\nYes, Mr. Moore omits some facts that all of us are now aware of (the 9/11 review papers were released after the documentary was finished) - and his personal opinions and views are quite obvious.

672;37.0;5.0;46.0;I was against 'Bush's War' from the beginning.  Like Michael Moore, I was criticized as unpatriotic and unsupportive of the troops (even though I served in the US Army from 1978-1984).  I had seen much of the information presented in the film previously, though from separate sources such as books and newspaper articles.  What Moore has done with 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is bring all the various facts concerning the Bush administration's misadventures all together in one controversial film.\n\nNo one should kid themselves-Michael Moore is a partisan ,and is firmly against what George Bush and his cronies represent. He fully expected - and welcomed - the firestorm of criticism his film generated. The irony is that as time goes by, more and more of what is presented in 'Fahrenheit' is being confirmed by former members of the Bush administration, arms inspectors in the Iraq invasion aftermath, and even by Bush and Cheney themselves!  Even powerful members of Bush's own Republican Party are now condemning the mess that the Iraq 'liberation' has become.\n\nI was enraged by what I saw in this movie.  How could so many Americans be so blind (and a large proportion of the population STILL refuses to see the truth)?  How could our media function as a cheerleading section for what was happening?  If nothing else, this film is a call to all Americans to vote to change the direction our country is now headed (or at minimum, at least express SOME kind of opinion by going to the ballot box).\n\nIf you haven't yet done so, see this film.

This is the most important documentary (and yes, it is a documentary) in my lifetime, in any of our lifetimes.\n\nWhether or not you're a dyed-in-the-wool Moore-phile (and believe me, I have reservations about the man), this film will make you think twice about our sitting president. No other filmmaker would've dared to take on the Bushes like this, and Moore should be commended, no, thanked by every American who loves this country and loves it honestly (not the kind of ""Mommy can never do wrong"" style of the neocons, possibly the most un-American group since the John Birch Society).\n\nI found the film just as powerful as I had heard (living in the South, Fahrenheit had a limited run around here at best, with some theaters not even showing it). The scenes of Iraq during the war (and the human toll it is taking) will break the heart of even the most diehard Bush-lover. I challenge anyone to question the mother who lost her son in terms of whether he died for the right cause. It's all well and good to say that this is a ""just war"". Just be sure you're honest enough when it strikes home.\n\nThe issues I have with the film are the suggestions that we entered Afghanistan to erect a pipeline, and nothing more. That to me is too awful of a premise, too ""Dr. Strangelove""-ian for me to fathom, but I can't help but wonder. Also, the ties to the Bin Laden family are slight, in many ways, but again you can't help but wonder if Moore is really loony or not to suggest them. It's a damning document of the Bush Administration's efforts to have it both ways (stay on alert, but shop), and the inefficancy of the Administration to combat terror in ways that are effective (as opposed to harassing a man in a gym simply because he questioned the President's motives in Afghanistan, which is shockingly something I suspect more commonplace than we'd like to think).\n\nWhether this will change anyone's minds (specifically those who plan to vote Bush), I can't say for sure. I'd like to think no one could be so close-minded as to not even consider seeing it, but I've been wrong before. This is far and away the most important movie of this year, and it is a masterpiece.\n\nSome might argue, ""Moore made this film simply to unseat Bush,"" but after seeing it, I can't say I don't blame him.

After only about 15 minutes of the constant little conspiracies thrown in one after the other I started laughing and then began to wonder why this film was considered so provocative by so many people. All Moore did was show Bush doing something like playing golf, while making small remarks like, ""Isn't it about time you got to work George?"" Apparently GWB spent his first 8 months on the golf course?? Yes it is that silly. He remarked that it looked like GWB was going to be a lame duck president, lame duck after only after 8 months, are we kidding? Especially, after the huge division Gore created when he demanded a re-count after he lost the election. A re-count in only a select few democrat counties. I guess what they really meant was ""Let every democrat vote count and count and count and count!"" One more thing, which is worse a president that spends his time playing golf, or one who spends his time getting BJ's in the oval office, no wonder we had the first world trade center bombings, Oklahoma city bombing, Waco, Ruby Ridge, the pull out in Somalia, the massacre in Rwanda, the attack on the Cole, the US embassy attacks in Africa, held to the same standards, Clinton looks pretty pathetic.\n\nI also thought it was really funny that Moore actually believes the entire world was somehow influenced by FOX NEWS when announcing GWB president. Fox was not even considered much competition back in 2000, so why would any news network base their coverage on what Fox had reported? Especially since they are considered a really conservative slanted station, right? Does this make any sense? I guess everyone at CNN and MSNBC sit around and watch FOX news to determine what facts to report. If this were true they all should be removed from the air.\n\nMoore would also show columns from a newspaper written by some liberal and then stress that they are indeed fact. Almost all the people I saw interviewed had a book bashing Bush or was some other flaming liberal fanatic.\n\nWhat was the point of showing Bush and others in the administration getting ready for the camera with make-up artists, etc., etc. Are we to believe the every single democrat went on air after 9-11 looking like they did when they woke up in the morning. He also tried to insinuate that the footage was on sept. 11 right after the attacks. He did this by showing the date sept. 10 then immediately after showing the edited for liberals Sept. 11 footage (to liberals 9-11 was apparently just a few papers flying in the air, dust and some really upset people.) the film jumps right to members of the Bush administration getting ready for the camera, while the credits roll. How could they be so vain after what just happened?\n\nHis constant attempt to make Bush look like an evil money grubbing, Saudi loving, oil corrupted, moron backfired and I found myself impressed by Bush even more than I already had been. This movie was just too much hype and it became a broken record really, really fast. Moore claims he loves this country, if he expressed this type of love to his wife would they still be married? Can you imagine if he made a movie about his wife by constantly bashing her and telling her how terrible she is and how messed up she is, and then giving no solution to the apparent problem? What Moore should of done instead was just filmed himself in front of the white house holding a sign that read ""I hate George W. Bush and America so much I can't stand it!"" He then could of simply went to the airport bought a plane ticket and left for France never to return.";Not a very well made film, boring and Moore did not even acheive his goal.
1490;42.0;5.0;45.0;Regardless of you opinion on Michael Moore, you have you admit, at least he's willing to share his opinion with the public. I personally think that we need more people like this in the United States. More and more people are becoming apathetic about politics. If this trend continues, pretty soon we'll have a small group of people who have very clear thoughts of what they want to do with the country. With the rest of the nation being apathetic, they'll be able to do whatever they want to the country! Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, or even just APATHETIC, go see this movie and develop an opinion! Keep changing that opinion! Never close your mind!\nAlso, to the review that claims Michael Moore was eating nothing but McDonald's for a month, a correction. The man eating nothing but McDonald's was Morgan Spurlock for his film Super Size Me.;I. Love. Michael. Moore.
570;43.0;5.0;44.0;"You have to admire the Bushphiles. Despite the almost weekly barrage of negative news reports, Govt. reports, Book releases and even movie releases, depicting a President that is woefully over his head, these supporters are as rock solid, ""steadfast"" if you will, in their faith of Bush as many of them are in their fundamental faith of God.\n\nIs this good? Well maybe. It shows character but it also infers a certain amount of innocence. President Bush could be characterized as ""steadfast"". Well, Merriam-Webster defines ""steadfast"" thusly, firmly fixed in place : IMMOVABLE b : not subject to change. As you can see being ""steadfast"" depending on application can be a good or bad thing. Let's look at a related word ""intransigence"" refusing to compromise or to abandon an extreme position or attitude : UNCOMPROMISING b : IRRECONCILABLE. To the Bushphobes, this word describes President Bush more accurately. If you are a Bushphile have you really checked the overwhelming amount of unfavorable independent information coming forth. Have you read or viewed any of the less than positive information available regarding our President, have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11?\n\nFahrenheit 9/11\n\nIn a surreal scene, our President, G.W. Bush is reading a book to a class of first graders in a Florida elementary school. After having been told that an airplane had hit a World Trade Center Tower in New York previously, George went into the classroom as not to keep these six and seven year olds waiting. While in the classroom, he is informed by a subordinate, that a second plane has hit the other tower. Does George excuse himself stating that he has an emergency to attend too? No, George sits there, sometimes reading ""My Pet Goat"", sometimes staring off, for almost SEVEN MINUTES!\n\nMichael Moore's controversial film begins by rehashing the equally controversial and extremely polarizing 2000 Presidential election. Though rushing through the Florida shenanigans, making some interesting points but with time restraints barely touching on the variety of previously reported inconsistencies.\n\nFrom there, Moore moves on to the 9/11 catastrophe itself and thankfully, he tastefully refrains from showing actual footage of the disaster instead concentrating on bystanders reactions, generally showing people looking up but resisting the temptation to go there with the camera.\n\nThen, in the previously mentioned schoolroom scene, Moore suggests that maybe the President is reflecting upon his missteps, such as not having at least one meeting with his own head of counterterrorism or not reading the briefing of Aug 6, 2001 stating al Qeada intended to attack the United States soon by hijacking airplanes.\n\nMichael Moore goes on to characterize other facets of previous and following events which, in his and my opinion, illustrate the questionable actions of the President and or his staff.\n\nMoore indicates that in each of G.W.'s failed business ventures he had Saudi and even the bin Laden family financial backing, which in Moore's opinion have extended a dark Bush/Saudi/bin Laden alliance, ultimately the reason 142 Saudis including bin Laden family members being rushed out of the United States after Sept. 13th.\n\nBut Moore's real salvos are reserved for the ill conceived, ill planned and ultimately unnecessary invasion of Iraq. This segment starts out with White House, counterterrorism chief, Richard Clark basically saying the Bush administration wanted to and planned to invade Iraq from before they took office and that Afghanistan and al-Qeada were an inconvenient diversion. Of course Moore extrapolates that for his case that Bush marginalized the continuing hunt for bin Laden to gear up for the now infamous Bush War.\n\nBut hey, I'm giving away too much of this fascinating movie. See It!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMichael Moore is truly in his element as he excoriates the clueless G.W. Bush. This movie reminds me of a roast except for this recipient, the jibes are real and not in fun, however, there are indeed many humorous moments albeit satirical in nature.\n\nMy favorite humorous part was when Moore initially depicted a burning map of Afghanistan set to the theme song from the popular TV show, Bonanza, then showing the cast (G.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfield and Tony Blair) dressed in Bonanza style cowboy attire.\n\nOf course, the Bush clan paints this movie as a pack of scurrilous lies with no basis in truth but then, why does it jive with the facts I do know and why does it have a conspicuous ring of truth?\n\nBack to our Bushphiles. If you intend to vote for G.W. but haven't seen or read anything negative about the President, at least see this movie. This is the most important presidential election I can remember in forty years. If you see this movie and still want to vote for Bush, fine I can live with that. What I can't live with are the pig headed uninformed sheep who like three famous monkeys, refuse to see, hear and speak any ....! Those people aren't Bushphiles. They are Bushocrites.";A Compelling Case for the Retirement of G.W.Bush
961;44.0;5.0;44.0;By far the most important episode in this film is the section where Bush, after being informed of the fact that the second tower had been hit by a plane, fails to carry out his duties as commander in chief for a crucial seven minutes. A competent commander in chief would have responded by politely excusing himself from the class and heading for the car in which he came in, which had a secure phone, and, while ordering the driver to head for Air Force One, using the phone to call the appropriate people in Washington and taking command of the situation.\n\nThe film clearly shows that instead he sat there clueless for seven crucial minutes, while the students were reading The Pet Goat to him, not knowing what other terrorist attacks were in the process of happening, and while, in fact, two more hijacked planes were headed for Washington. This is not the way Bill Clinton would have responded, nor for that matter Bush senior.\n\nIf a uniformed general had failed to act like that, he would not only have been removed from command, but also court marshaled for dereliction of duty.\n\nThank God that the Cold War was over and that we were not under a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union.\n\nThis is a crucially important movie that all Americans should see because Bush's failure to carry out his responsibilities of commander in chief during these crucial minutes proves that he is not fit to be commander in chief. It makes a compelling case that the people must remove him from his command this November.;Film proves Bush unfit to be commander in chief
1080;45.0;5.0;44.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 has its share of faults but definitely accomplishes one very important thing in the current climate of rightwing information dominance: it systematically picks apart the lies and secrets of the unelected regime of George W. Bush. Among the many facts that cause audience members to gasp when they see this film are:\n\n--The illegal manner in which the Bush team rigged the election in Florida largely by disenfranchising eligible Black Democrat voters.\n\n--The fact that the Bush family has done business with terrorists (namely the bin Laden family) for decades and treasonously allowed the bin Laden family to leave the United States immediately after the attacks of September 11th , before other flights were allowed to resume and before the FBI could question them.\n\n--The fact that far from showing ""courage and leadership"" immediately after the attacks of September 11th, unelected President Bush sat in a class room for several minutes reading ""My Pet Goat"" to children with a stunned expression on his face.\n\n--The fact that the Bush regime manipulated legitimate fears of terror among the nation's citizens mostly with bizarre warnings and a meaningless color code system in order to force through a deeply unpopular right wing agenda of social and economic policies that are extremely harmful to all but the most wealthy Americans. Actually, in the long run these policies will destroy them too, they are just too short-sited to realize this.\n\n--The fact that not one congressional leader read the totalitarian provisions of the USAPATRIOT Act before voting for it. Not one.\n\n--The fact that the Bush regime abandoned all but the rhetoric behind the war on terror in order to pursue its pre-election dream of colonizing Iraq.\n\n--The fact that the situation is Iraq is a disaster. We are destroying peoples' lives, and randomly arresting and torturing people there. Our troops are getting killed and wounded in a war that is based exclusively on the lies of George W. Bush and on the aims of right wing zealots and oil companies.\n\n--The fact that American companies flagrantly admit that the war in Iraq is a colonial occupation from which they profit.\n\n--The fact that none of the children of war proponents ever have to risk their lives in this war, only the poor do.\n\nNone of this is new of course to anyone who read political biographies and newspapers. The accomplishment of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that it captures a lot of publicly available information that has previously been relegated to the back pages of newspapers and brings it into our movie houses and living rooms so that even the most delusional of us can no longer pretend that the Bush Regime is legitimate and that it knows what it's doing.";Imperfect but sadly enough it's right on the money

And can anyone tell me how a guy who marries a librarian, and whose mother heads the Foundation for Family Literacy slips through the literacy cracks?  Oh well...)\nFace facts, all you who have seen the movie, Moore has said that this movie is not fair to Bush, and that this movie is his way to get Bush out of office.  I think that using our freedom of speech in such a way is only fair, since Bush, Inc. has used every unfair method at their disposal to pull off the garbage which they're still trying to get away with.  Every day Bush backpedals a little more in order to justify his war, his policies, and our reporters standing around being stenographers just writing it down, not using their brains to put anything together.

1406;47.0;5.0;44.0;"The good news: I just came back from watching a great Horror movie. The bad news: the Horror is real. Michael Moore, the documentary filmmaker famous for his flat Midwestern accent, his girth and brilliant muckraking films such as ROGER & ME (1989), THE BIG ONE (1997) and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002, this one unseen by me as of yet), has crafted what may be his ultimate depiction of sad reality. This is about our nation's present situation in Iraq and how we came to be there, how it is currently being fought, how it is justified by those who are in power but don't have any children serving in Iraq, etc. It begins with a pre-title sequence showing the horrific event that started this ball rolling: the stealing of the Presidency by George W. Bush.\nFrom the early days of the Bush Administration, which show Georgie out fishing in Kennebunkport, Maine, relaxing in his ranch in Crawford, Texas (and claiming to be ""taking care of business"" in the meantime), to the aftermath of September 11, 2001, we are presented with the facts as they unfurled before various videocameras and live cable feeds. We are presented with an administration run by men whose families have strong business and personal ties with Saudi Arabian government officials and billionaire businessmen, with a Vice President whose oil company he chaired (immediately before his current job of serving the public as the nation's #2 man) being granted one no-bid contract after the other, and reaping billions in dollars in profit in the process, with soldiers being targeted for recruitment out of the poorest neighborhoods (that were, ironically, made even poorer by the current administration's economic policies) by slathering Marine recruiters to fight a war---a war that they had nothing to do with, against an enemy who had never laid hands on American soil or an American citizen, for a cause that was misrepresented to begin with, to fight a war that supposedly ended on May 1st of last year, and which is still being fought as these words are being typed today. As you are reading them on some other day. Perhaps while one of your loved ones is fighting. Or being killed. That, I believe, is the point of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 (2004), a film made---believe it or not---to honor those who face this daily hell, either as a soldier or an agonized family member. A hell that they did not create, yet are expected to ""win.""\nSome of you reading this review may be among those who accuse Michael Moore of politicizing this war, or 9/11 itself. Yet by actually *watching* this film, it is clearly seen that George W. Bush (along with his entire entourage of Cabinet members such as Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Assistant Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice) has politicized the war by sporadically using the ""Security Level Alert"" system (or whatever it's called) to create fear and tension throughout the American populace, and using that fear to hype-up support for a war that has been waged almost entirely for business reasons; ironically, for reasons that hold no benefit whatsoever for the average American. As one war-supporting woman in the film says, you may think the events in this film are all ""staged."" Sure they were staged; by the President, his Cabinet officials, by the U.S. military, even by the national network TV news stations. Lastly, some of you may decry this film as ""propaganda."" Oh, I *love* that one! You want propaganda? Turn on Fox News Channel any day of the week, any time of the day---there, you'll get Bush Admin propaganda 24/7.\nStill want to accuse Michael Moore of political propagandizing? Fine, but think about this: at least his ""propaganda"" hasn't directly led to hundreds (perhaps soon to be thousands) of American soldiers losing their lives. Or to thousands (perhaps soon to be tens of thousands) of innocent Iraqi people being killed by their ""protectors."" All Moore is doing is encapsulating reality, by shrinking down the millions of hours of broadcasting and giving us the facts. The facts like the Saudi Arabian embassy being across the street from the Watergate hotel and prominent U.S. Government buildings (the only such embassy, by the way, that has continual Secret Service protection). Facts such as arch-conservative (and former Nixon administration official) Richard Perle confessing that Bush had gotten it all wrong when he decided to go after Iraq. Facts like a self-proclaimed ""conservative"" from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan who had been a strong war-supporter, until that very war took the life of her son. Other facts too numerous to mention here. For more information as to how wrong our current path is, please see this film. It just may make you angry enough to vote Bush out in November.\nMOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 14 & UP";A Must-See!

Let me ask, how can Mr. Moore make a movie loaded with lies when you see the actual people, Mr. Bush included, making the statements and going through the actual motions.  There is no film making trickery in this movie at all.  Every word out hear and person you see is as it is happening.

A must see documentary in this political season, regardless of your political persuasion.  Before going to the polls, the electorate needs an incisive review of a candidate's job performance - particulary the incumbent's.

758;53.0;5.0;42.0;Moore adds an emotional punchline to the bizarre and disturbing tale of a hapless president propelled to power by a shadowy radical cabal. The tale would be almost unbelievable if not for the fact that reality -- e.g., the catastrophe in Iraq -- intrudes rudely into the neocons' fantasy world. It's hard to believe that anyone could steal an election. We don't want to believe it. But as we watch the unfolding of recent events and the president's addled campaign performances, we find that our disbelief begins to wane. Fahrenheit 9/11 only began the process of demystifying the web of intrigue surrounding the Bush administration. To Moore's credit, he serves up just enough detail to move his audience. Unfortunately, there's alot more where that came from.;Barely scratches the surface

Eventually, one of my co-workers offered to buy me a ticket (no way was I going to give my money to Moore), and I did sit through a showing.\n\nWhen I came out of that theater, I thought my head was going to explode.

I don't support Kerry, as he isn't in line with my views politically or fiscally.  No, I'm going to sit this election out.

It was rediculous, and like Michael Moore said, they played ""cheerleader.""\nSo you see, this movie makes them look bad. That's the ONLY reason why they say it's full of lies. Ironically, it's the other way around.\nOn a lighter note, this is a fantastic movie, and possibly the most important movie EVER MADE.

""Fahrenheit 911"" was made now for political attacks or gain, but simply as Michael Moore has done to tell the truth when no one else has, IN fact during several points of the film, several familiar reporters: Dan Rather, Katie Couric, Matt Laurer all show their lies and ignorance in supporting Mr. Bush agenda to invade Iraq and blame Saddam Hussein for the Sept 11 attacks. However Bush at the same time uses Sept 11 in an attempt to salvage his downward approval ratings, using the attack to bully and invade other countries that don't approve of his policies, pardoning several corrupt organizations that have done wrong doing, and last but not least, having profitable communication with and protecting the Osama Bin Laden Family and then contradicting himself with false allegations of nuclear weapons of Mass Destruction which still has not been found since the days of President Clinton.\n\nThe movie starts of with the debacle that was the President Election in 2000 with the fiasco in Florida, led by Presiden't Bush's brother Jed and his cohorts of liars to fix the election in Florida in Bush's favor when it looks like Al Gore (who won several states in his favor)was going to win Florida and the Presidential Election. Moore points out how and a company called DATA BASE TECHNOLOGIES manipulated and lied with the vote counts in Bush's direction, securing the state of Florida and making George W. Bush the President of the United States. Last but not least the ties Bush has with Supreme Court that dashed Gore's hope for Presidency. Of course Bush himself who leads the war in Irad has his own contradictory military records. The movie then shows us the horrible day that was Sept 11, 2001 and then shows us President Bush's nonchalant attitude during the first minutes of Sept 11 where he attended some small preschool during a reading of ""billy and his goat"" while having a peaceful reaction when a member of security teams tells him about the hijacking. Bush does not flinch or show any regard for human life during these first minutes.\n\nThe movie then shows us how Bush and company took advantage of Sept. 11 attacks to use it for their own agenda, that is initiating war with Iraq, arresting people of Middle Eastern decent (except the Osama Bin Laden Family) and of course the most controversial aspect of the whole movie, George W. Bush having business associations with Osama Bin Laden family. That about sends chills down my spine what about you? When we have a U.S. President who swears on the bible to serve the people of America and yet really is serving his own agenda and those who don't agree to his terms watch out!!! Of course since Sept 11, we have learned that President Bush did receive ample warning of terrorist attacks including a four year memo that was kept hidden. Jack Cloogen, former FBI Agent, details the failure to prevent Sept 11 briefly in the movie. The 911 Commission has also shown that there was also nothing done by the FBI and CIA (despite their intelligence reports that an attack was imminent) to prevent the attacks.\n\nMoore then shows us the downright lies about Saddam Hussein going back to 2001 when the disgraceful General Colin Powell says that Saddam Hussein quote ""doesnt pose a threat"" and has no weapons of mass destruction. Of course pre Sept 11 despite our boasts about security with President Clinton our security problems and problems with trust were lousy. As covered by ABCNEWS, CBSNEWS, firefighters , police officers, had unworking equipment including walkie talkies, mass confusions and lack of communication, this in turn describes the war with Iraq. Remember George Bush never got permission from Congress or Senate to launch this war and in part several of our former cowardly allies: Great Britain, Uk, Dominican Republic have backed out . The American casualties for the war have been great over 200 servicemen killed in the line of duty. Yet we have the arrogant and pompous saying ""were winning the war"" while sitting home all cozy in the White House. Now ""Fahrenheit 911"" was actually financed by Walt Disney Company yet, when it came to release the movie, the Disney still led by cowards like Michael Eisner put the movie on the shelves. However ""Lions Gate Films (who also released Beyond the Mat) stepped up to the plate and showed guts in releasing the film. Then as I hosted a thread on IMDb cheap, corrupted reporters like Matt Laurer tried to attack Michael Moore before the movie was even released. Laurer, acts so unprofessional to Moore that its hard to believe this guy has a job as reporter for NBC when he really is just a liar, a pasty doing a con job for a higher power. He failed as ""Fahrenheit 911"" is one of the highest grossing documentaries of all times breaking box office records and earning the respect and intrigue of many Americans who have seen the lies exposed by their government, president and Military.\n\nA special note of interest is that Moore in the NBC Dateline interview mentioned how one scene was cut, that is when an American soldier, beats and assaults a prisoner of film. this was recorded way before the vile disgraceful actions of the men and women of the Army at Abu Gharaid, where allegations of prisoner abuse have now been proven true by those graphic pictures and sex tapes.\n\nAll the facts I have listed are from watching the movie numerous times, now with what happened in the political debates\nwith John Kerry and George Bush its important you see this movie.";Michael Moore does it again with another important film!!
1126;60.0;5.0;41.0;Before this film I didn't like Mike Moore. I now have an amazing amount of respect for him. He has balls for telling the truth when no media outlet, politician, or citizen would. I went into the theater a republican and came out a democrat. George Bush has got to be the biggest dumbass I have ever seen, which is proven in the ending of the film as well as the entire masterpiece itself.

That doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing.\n\n This film is propaganda. Everything is. The commercial for a Lexus, President Bush giving a speech, that's all propaganda. Propaganda is anything that tries to persuade you one way or another.\n\n This film is merely one man's perspective on the current state of Bush's administration.\n\n I have read over a dozen 1 star reviews, and almost all of them state that this film is a ""liberal piece of garbage"" and that is it ""Anti-American"". Let's not forget that it's completely full of lies, yet no one seems to back that up, and if they do, they're referring to some OTHER propoganda which completely invalidates their main point.\n\n This film is by no means ""Anti-American"". Moore completely supports our troops and he loves this country. Attacking Bush does not equate him to being ""Anti-American"". He is excersizing his right of Freedom of Speech.\n\n If you don't want to give Moore any of your money than either download a bootleg of Fahrenheit 9/11 or sneak into it at the theatre. Form your own opinion. Don't let anyone tell you this movie is bad and decide not to see it based on what they tell you. See this movie with an open mind, research the facts, and decide for yourself.\n\n Truth lies between the two extremities.";This movie doesn't deserve a 1 star rating

Mr. Moore did a very credible job of exposing the truth in what we are not told that happens behind the scenes, and bringing it to the surface. Some don't like the film, but it sure opened my eyes to what's hsappening and what's NOT in Washington, DC. Hopefully, there will be honesty and surety in the voting this time, and ALL the votes will be counted. Then the Supreme Court won't have to ""appoint"" the next president.";A Must See!
424;63.0;1.0;40.0;"With the pressing of ""Play,"" one becomes immediately aware that there is something drastically wrong with this documentary. No other one I've encountered included a disclaimer announcing that ""the following interviews and commentary are for entertainment only."" Such a warning is anathema to the goal of a documentary, which should be to educate. As far as entertainment value goes, however, you'd have to be a member of the tinfoil hat left (or those who think John Ashcroft's men interrogate librarians every other Monday) to get any meaningful information out of this film.\n\nWhat is most surprising is that, even from a technical standpoint, Moore's skills are overrated. The film drags on and on. It is devoid of drama as Moore cannot be bothered to showcase any conflicting points of view. Had he merely interviewed a couple of people who were not partisan Democrats he might have succeeded in making the film digestible, but he's simply not interested. If the plot were outlined in equation form, it would read: 2000 Election=Republican Plot, Iraq=Vietnam, Bush=Oppressor, Emotion=Fact, and Individual Suffering=Needed Alteration of Foreign Policy.\n\nBy the end of the film one feels used and cheated. You may feel anger and indignation, but it's solely due to charlatans like Moore earning fortunes from the cobbling together of mendacious inuendos. It is rather depressing to watch such a cultural blockbuster and, with little concentration, think up five hundred responses which devastate Moore's positions. It's quite easy to do with Fahrenheit 9/11 as it relies chiefly on emotion. The director's emotophilia is even more pronounced in this film than it was in Bowling for Columbine. In the end we have only feeling. He spends over thirty minutes with a woman from Flint who tragically lost a son in Iraq. One feels sympathy for her until she abandons any sense of perspective by deciding that the result of her son's death will be for her to vent all of her rage and anguish in the direction of The White House and President George W. Bush. Moore couldn't be happier about her conclusion and hopes that you'll do the same.\n\nBefore I saw the movie, allegations by commentators that the film violated McCain-Feingold struck me as unfair, but the evidence is in the reels. We hear from an injured soldier who states (I'm not kidding) that once he gets home the first thing he is going to do is become very active in his local Democratic Party. Go leftist young man! We also see the dour and self-righteous filmmaker on Capitol Hill attempting to convince Congressmen that they should sign their kids up for Iraq. This is yet another of his many ""emotional over all"" segments, but one begins to wonder here about Moore's intelligence. Does he really think that parents can enlist their sons without their consent? Does he even know that children are not allowed in the military? I heard him repeat this same line of anti-reasoning during an interview with Bill O'Reilly over the summer. His confusion here may be based on a utopian's ignorance about the mechanics of the real world.\n\nIn retrospect, a more accurate title for this film would have been, The Eternal Bush, as its spirit and one-sidedness is remarkably similar to Goebbels' The Eternal Jew. All that is needed is a few shots of Republican legislators scampering into state houses like rats to complete the portrait. Obviously, it's quite fashionable to compare individuals to members of The Third Reich and I am loath to add my pen to the cultural totality of misapplied historical allusions, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is nothing more than an ideologue's checklist of propaganda.\n\nWith Moore, most of his arguments refute themselves. One cannot believe that the Patriot Act is turning us into a police state when the very existence and celebration of Fahrenheit 9/11 disproves it. This is the freest country in the world and nothing better exemplifies our liberty than somebody like Michael Moore making millions from the dissemination of his anti-American propaganda. Perhaps he might consider naming his next film, ""Bush Made Me.""";Frequent Hate 9/11!
701;64.0;5.0;40.0;This film's greatest success is that it holds back and lets the viewer make thier own conclusions.  Moore himself, appears only once in front of the camera.  This in sharp contrast to his previous films where he stood front and center.  This film raises questions about arguably the most testing time since the fall of communism.\n\nThe most profound moments was seeing a mother who had lost her son in Iraq and watching her struggle with the pain that no parent should ever have to go through, the death a child.  Also important was the way that Moore shows us a different and new side of this national tragedy.  He lets us hear the audio from that tragic day alone, which was the most stunning depiction that I have ever been exposed to (after being shown the video hundreds of times I realized that I had become numb to the horror).\n\nAgree or disagree with Moore, this film aids the morning and the spiritual redress of this wound.  I highly recommend this film.;Heartbreaking and profound
107;65.0;4.0;37.0;"Five things struck me about this film that have stayed with me:\n\n1) President Bush's almost sphinx-like reaction to the news of the terrorist attack on 09/11;\n\n2) his weekend at the ranch clearing brush appearing as the common man's man while ignoring the August 6th memo that announced al-Qaeda was going to attempt an attack against the United States using airplanes;\n\n3) telling reporters (and forgive me, if I don't have it completely right) ""I think it's important that we all fight against terrorism."" Then, he segues to ""Now watch this shot."" as he steps up to the tee.\n\n4) the mother who lost her son in Iraq;\n\n5) The military targeting the poor for recruiting.\n\nThe first image of President Bush in the classroom gives him the appearance of a clueless Captain Queeg who simply does not know what to do. That is not how I want our leader to react in a time of imminent crisis.\n\nThe second image of our president at his ranch where he has spent 40% of his presidency suggests that the August 6th memo was not given its proper attention. No matter what spin neo con talk show radio hacks may want to say about Clinton, no one can seriously say that this president did not have the information to do something, to take some action other than standing in front of his pick-up and clear brush. As a reminder of how clueless this administration was, Condoleeza Rice was still promoting an upgraded nuclear ballistic missile system, and the attorney general, John Ashcroft placed terrorism under drug interdiction on his priority tree. That's how clueless these people were.\n\nThe president talking about getting everyone to fight terrorism and then blithely segueing into, ""Now watch this shot,"" suggests that his prior comments were almost reflexive and insincere. It isn't appropriate to say, ""Now watch this shot!"" right after discussing terrorism.\n\nWhile filming the mother who lost a son in Iraq may seem to be a cheap shot at gaining sympathy, it does send another important message: this mother and other Americans who speak out against the war are patriots, far more so than the people who attempt to brand them as traitors.\n\nMoore makes an excellent point here about how the poor are so actively recruited for the military while congress keeps their sons and daughters out of harm's way, but are quite willing to send the children of others into harm's way. This is a very old tradition. The president was even the beneficiary of it, receiving a direct commission he did not have to earn, and being jumped over 600 other personnel waiting on the list for the Texas Air National Guard.\n\nI gave this only four stars because Spinsanity was able to find a number of misdirections and false impressions under Michael Moore's direction.\n\nNevertheless, this is an important film worth seeing or purchasing.\n\nP.S. Some have called Michael Moore a hypocrite for having made a ton of money, and having put some of it in tax shelters. Three questions come to mind: So, what? Is he supposed to be poor, or something?

1015;67.0;5.0;40.0;"You can say what you want about Michael Moore's bias, but the most damaging elements of the film are footage of George W. Bush himself.  The statement ""Some call you the elite.  I call you my base"" is an incredibly telling comment.  And Haliburton employees at their sales meeting crowing that its going to be a very good year for them (and then try to back pedal, saying ""Oh, but bad for our soldiers."") tells you all you need to know about the realities of Iraq.  Michael Moore simply can't make up better stuff than this!\n\nIt always surprises me when the common man is duped into believing this administration is doing right by him, despite all evidence to the contrary. That man will never see this film, let alone with the proper air of scepticism and curiousity.  And we'll all pay for that as the tax base gets shifted to the middle class, our health costs escalate and our boys go to war.  We watch helplessly as our tax dollars are delivered and without accountability to defense contractors and oil companies.\n\nAnd that really is the theme of Farenheit 911.

1115;68.0;5.0;40.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 is an important and powerful film.  It indicts the media almost as much as it does President Bush.  Its facts are very well backed-up -- see the free web-based encyclopedia for an excellent and thorough review.  [...]\n\nThe movie is important because it shows the footage and quotes that we should have seen elsewhere.  Colin Powell saying that Iraq was not a threat was footage that we should have seen before the war.  For those with any ability to show skepticism, we saw that the threat from Iraq was being exaggerated.\n\nThe film also gives a peek behind the curtain of national politics in the United States.  You start to realize how much the presidency (this administration and earlier ones) are so much about acting and show business.\n\nReviewers talk about the air space being open on Sept. 14, 2001, but it was still very difficult for the average members of the public to get air tickets.  (I have a friend who was trying to get out of New York City at the time.)  And hundreds of people were being detained for weeks on relatively flimsy connections whereas whole plane-loads of Saudis and bin Ladens were allowed to leave with very brief interviews almost certainly because of their connection to Bush.\n\nOne other important message from the movie is that war is horror.  It should always be a last resort.  Invading Afghanistan was necessary; invading Iraq was not.  It is morally wrong to use war as just another tool of foreign policy.  If you think that war is no big deal or that it is exciting or fun to bomb and shoot people, please see this movie.\n\nI give the movie 5 stars for powerful content, excellent editing, important facts, and moving music.

761;76.0;4.0;39.0;"Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 911"" was one of the first documentary movies to take on the lies and evasions of the Bush Administration. It created enormous controversy earlier in 2004 when it was released. The DVD version, coming out just a month before the presidential election, is likely to exhume the same emotions that surfaced this spring.\n\n""Fahrenheit"" is not a perfect movie. Moore's approach is to illustrate his points via stunts, not all of which work. Cornering US reps to get their kids to join to the military makes the point that reps are not terribly willing to put their own families on the line in the war on terror. But then, few Americans have had to sacrifice (yet) in this war. Though it has its moments of humor and absurdity, ""Fahrenheit"" is more frightening than funny; the stakes are too high. While it may be humorous to hear Congressman Charles Dingell ""lecture"" Moore about how our reps don't read the bills that come before them, it's pretty frightening that this is the case. The Patriot Act -- rushed through Congress with barely a reading and barely a debate -- being a case in point.\n\nThat being said, Moore does provide us with well-executed (and frightening) snapshots of early-21st century America and its top leadership. Watching President Bush sit for 7 long minutes while reading ""My Pet Goat"" to a bunch of gradeschoolers said a lot about his purported leadership abilities. Witnessing the enormous protests in Washington at Bush's Inauguration made me wonder why I had not seen these images before. Seeing a mother, who had lost a son in Iraq, assailed in Washington, DC by a true Bush believer spoke volumes about the desire of many citizens to maintain their rosy view of Bush ""values"" and policies in the face of contrary evidence. Hearing American soldiers screaming in agony after an attack brought home the human cost of the war, which has been suppressed by our leaders. Listening to an Oregon State Trooper describing the budget cuts that have left a long swath of coastline unprotected brought home the degree to which Bush has actually left our homeland less secure than before the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThere's no doubt that Moore is a polemicist -- he is trying to influence the thinking of Americans who would rather not believe the duplicity and danger of the current administation. But being a polemicist doesn't make you a liar, as many of Moore's detractors would have us believe. ""Fahrenheit 911"" is an important addition to the currently muffled voice of protest and truth.

Remember, Bush had already been told about the first plane hitting the WTC building before he entered the classroom and did nothing.  And while Bush was sitting on a stool in the classroom Andy Card came in and told Bush of the second plane striking the second WTC building.  Instead of Bush acting like ANY REAL leader he just sat there on his stool holding the child's color book ""The Pet Goat"".  And remember, Bush didn't know if there were just two planes hijacked, or a hundred.  Bush did nothing.  I can safely say that every child in that classroom was more competent than Bush to be President of the United States, and Commander in Chief at that moment.\n\nWake up republicans and stop allowing yourselves to be dupes to corrupt GOP propaganda.

Instead of a stage and disappearing (attractive) lady assistants, Moore is a magician whose medium is film and politics. And like most magicians, Moore puts on an entertaining show.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11, the latest in Micheal Moore's successful line of ""documentary"" films, is cunningly edited. I give it two stars for that. Unfortunately, I have to with-hold the other three because it's masquerading as something it's not; a documentary. Moore's trademarks are his crafty editing to lead the viewers to the wrong conclusions and ""facts"" without context.\n\nIt starts right away, when in the beginning of the film, Moore makes it seem that FOX News called Florida for Bush when all of the other networks were calling for Gore. In reality, FOX called Florida for Gore just minutes after NBC and CBS did. When it was realized that the vote was too close to call, CBS and CNN retracted their call for Gore at 10:00PM. FOX retracted their call for Gore four hours later, at 2:00AM. It's obvious that Moore was trying to tap into the perception that FOX News is partial to President Bush.\n\nA bit later, Moore insinuates that President Bush had not read the security briefing on August 6, 2001, which contained information that Osama Bin Laden planned to attack America by hijacking planes, because the title was vague. He then shows a video clip of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice announcing the title of the briefing as ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US."" Only Moore claims that Pres. Bush did not read the briefing. Further, Moore doesn't show the viewer that the briefing's *contents* were vague. It did not say that Bin Laden was seeking to hijack aircraft for attacks, but instead to use the hijackings to demand the release of US held associates of Bin Laden. The briefing did not specify what kind of attacks Bin Laden was planning, just that the planning was taking place.\n\nOne of his facts without context in the film is the segment on the Saudis, including members of the Bin Laden family, who were flown out of the US. Moore creates the impression that they were flown out with special treatment on orders from the White House while all other flights were still grounded. In fact, all of the Saudi flights took place after airspace was reopened. Also, the 9/11 Commission found that each flight was properly scrutinized by authorities (including the FBI) before they departed. There was nothing sinister about these flights, no matter how hard Moore tries to imply otherwise.\n\nIn all, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an entertaining film. However, Moore cannot be taken seriously as an arbiter of truth.

687;82.0;5.0;38.0;This movie opens our eyes and sharpens our ears. It's hard to imagine that our own elected president is dishonest and puts interests of a few above those of millions here and in Iraq. I have my great respect for Michael Moore who dares to speak up and reveals all the interesting (but seldom discussed or deliberately suppressed) issues surrounding 9/11 and the Iraqi war. I don't find the movie overly biased at all. It presents the issues in a plain factual manner. Everyone should watch this movie, analyze the facts and make his/her own conclusions.;A Revelation: Wake up America!
691;83.0;5.0;38.0;This is an extraordinary, powerful, and well thought out movie.  It is harsh on the Bush administration and their failures.  But more importantly... it is ALL documented.  You will hear a ton of BAD things about this movie from the extremely political people out there.  Facts are hard to dispute, so a spin campaign is in full force.  Michael Moore anticipated this and had complete documentation of his sources available for your own research.  Go to [...] / and check the sources to verify the accuracy of this movie before you listen to any of the negative propaganda against it.  So I emplore you, DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU HEAR... check it out for yourself and be intelligently informed.  This movie is a MASTERPIECE!!!;Don't believe everything you hear!
881;84.0;4.0;38.0;"Where there parts of this documentary that were border-line?  Yeah, but then again, one should expect that.  In fact, I was exacting a whole lot more than there was.  I had half bought into the conservative claims that the movie was just one big smear job by Moore.  However, after watching the movie I was amazed by how much it wasn't a ""i hate bush, but i won't back it up"" movie.\n\nComing to the criticisms by Conservatives.\n\n1. Many won't believe anyone who says anything bad about Bush anyway.  Heck, they still think that Iraq is in good shape, and that the economy is rolling like it's the 1990s again.  Those people will never be pursuaded that Bush is anything other than God on Earth.\n\n2. You can tell when one side of a debate doesn't have an arguement when they start attacking their opponent personally.  That is what has happened to a large degree in the negative comments here.  They simply dismiss Moore's claims as lies (mainly because of #1) and then go on to attack Moore as a person.\n\n3. I did visit the webpage listing 59 Moore lies or whatever.  However, after reading through much of it, a lot of it was irrelevant.  Does it matter that Gore was at the fundraiser too where Bush said ""some call you the rich and powerful but I call you my base"" (or whatever the quote was).  The examples of Gore's jokes seemed harmless (""and yes, I invented this dinner"") while with Bush's ""i call you my base"" joke one can almost tell that it has a slimy feeling to it.\n\nAlso, in the part of the movie where Bush says ""now watch this swing,"" he seems to believe that Moore is attacking Bush for playing golf while talking about attacking terrorism.  However, the fact that Bush is playing golf is irrelevant.  The part Moore was going after was that Bush almost seemed to take his golf swing as seriously, if not more seriously, than his comments about fighting terrorism.\n\nOn top of this, he attacks Moore on menial facts.  Did anyone REALLY believe that Gore's ""Victory party"" at the start of the movie was in fact a victory party?  I was actualy surpised to learn that it was taped on election day.  I was actually thinking it may be a picture of a rally with ""Victory Florida"" edited into the video to make it look like a victory celebration.\n\nAlso, this movie is not about Clinton, it's about Bush.  Who cares if Clinton has ties to some of the same companies Bush does?  Clinton wasn't President after 9/11, Bush was.  The claim is that Bush may have allowed his, his family's, and his buddies interests in front of the national interest because of these connections.  That claim is not impacted in any way by what business dealings other people may have had.\n\nFinally on this point, are there some cheap shots, such as showing Wofliwitz saliving up his hair? Yeah, but these can't be considered ""deceptions"" or anything.  Also, in his ""rebuttle"" of Moore's claim that the Saudi's hadn't been interviewed before leaving, he stated that something like 30 had been.  Well, 30 is no where near 147 or whatever the number was who left.  Also, I think WHEN the Saudi's left is less important than the fact that they got out ASAP, with apparently minimal questioning.\n\nThe conservatives are so bent up on little nit picky facts that they miss the big picture.  Even if Moore had presented a documentary that was unquestionably factual, most of his underlying premises would still be alive and kicking.";Conservative's critics fall flat
418;85.0;1.0;37.0;"The only reason to see this movie is to laugh all the way through at the pompousness of the Hollywood brain trust and in particular Michael Moore, who has the nerve to submit this for a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nOh, and one more reason: Moore's phony hate-filled Leni Riefenstahl-style agitprop handed john Kerry his defeat.\n\nThe sad part is, when Moore was doing TV Nation and satire like ""Canadian Bacon"" he managed to make some points, and even with ""Stupid White Men.""  Then he climbed on the George Bush is Satan bandwagon--he must have booked a double seat.  I would actually look forward to his upcoming expose ""Sicko"" and its commentary about health care if I hadn't been soured by Moore's propaganda and his constant savaging of Americans abroad in the British press.\n\nMichael Moore says Osama is Bush's best friend...well, in one sense, he's right, and he can count himself in that camp.  Both of them helped re-elect Bush.  The man who claimed to be a documentary filmmaker (his so-called warnings about the entertainment value are fake, he's hoping everyone will take the film as fact) can't face reality himself: the overwhelming majority of us ""stupid Americans"" voted for Bush.  Without even a Supreme Court decision!\n\nSomewhere there is still artistic and philosophical merit in Michael Moore, and as an American he has a right to express his views.  Unfortunately for him, we do too, and we did on November 2, 2004.";Bush's re-election is its only merit
427;86.0;5.0;37.0;"Interesting how quite a number of people who gave this documentary one star didn't manage to respond with a well-argued and intelligent rebuttal, but were reduced to spewing out vitriolic insults about how Michael Moore is fat. What's your point? Socrates was also a bit of a lard ass but we don't think of him today as some bloated, beardy Greek but as a man who managed to teach people to think for themselves for a change.\n\nPersonally I don't believe you need to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 to know something is fundamentally wrong with the Bush administration. All you need is a triple digit IQ and a brain capable of independent thought. Sadly not everyone is gifted with such intelligence and that's why we need people like Michael Moore to spell things out for us. This is especially true in a country where a not insignificant number of voters, right up to election day, still thought that Hussein was responsible for 9/11, that Iraq is armed to the teeth and George Bush is the only thing standing between us and the forces of Evil. The hard truth that most republicans will refuse to accept is that it was stupidity, ignorance and above all fear that got Bush re-elected.\n\nAnd even if we disagree with Moore's main contention: that George Bush bombed a defenceless third world country, killing over 100,000 civilians, just to steal their oil, the incredible irony remains, that on November 2nd a huge number of republicans who voted for Bush did so ""on moral grounds"". For these people the deaths of over eleven hundred soldiers and countless thousands of innocent men, women and children was less important than preventing gays from marrying!!! But then perhaps it's easy for predominantly white fundamentalist Christians to condone the needless slaughter of so many innocents when the innocents concerned are just little brown Muslims in some far off part of the world they couldn't even find on a map if they tried.\n\nTo finish, I obviously accept that Saddam Hussein was an evil man who murdered, tortured and incarcerated without trial many of his own people. Well now, thanks to Bush, so have we. Michael Moore may have failed in his quest to kick Bush out or the White House, but if he caused even a handful of flag-waving jingoists to start thinking for themselves for a change then he has achieved at least some measure of success. Remember, to love your country does not mean never to question its actions; that's one of the fundamental differences between democracy and totalitarianism.";Welcome to Big Brother
456;87.0;1.0;37.0;"George W. Bush is not a great president; in fact, he is a major expansionist who will likely blow up the federal deficit into the tens of trillions, especially now that he has won a second term.  Part of the reason that Bush has not been effectively defeated is that his opponents have become too unhinged, just as many prominent Republicans seemed to lose their sanity during the Clinton years.  In politics, it is often not that one side clearly prevails, but that the other side, due to its own excesses, manages to completely alienate a majority of the American electorate.  What we have seen since the 2000 election is the rise of several rabid leftists -- George Soros, the wackos in Hollywood, etc. -- who foam at the mouth and generally make complete asses of themselves while attempting to discredit the president.  Michael Moore may be the best example of this collection of hotheads and malcontents.  Many observers have voiced their outrage at Moore's antics; people like me, however, realize the man for what he is: a pompous fool who does more harm to his causes than any Republican ever could.  Rather than rail against this filmmaker, Bush loyalists should offer to subsidize his next feature film.\n\nMoore's latest offering, the amazingly dishonest FAHRENHEIT 9/11, may be his most ridiculous project to date.  The same idiot who told us that terrorism was not a problem has now made an entire film excoriating the Bush Administration for not going after Osama Bin Laden.  As usual, the filmmaker has presented a number of themes, many of which completely contradict each other (BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was even more notorious in its dreadful lack of consistency).  At one point in the movie, Moore implies that the American troops in Iraq are cold-hearted neandrathals who derive great pleasure from torturing and murdering innocent civilians.  Later he feigns sympathy for those serving in the armed services, portraying them as a bunch of poor kids who had few options in life but to join the military (and thus, Moore also plays the standard class warfare game).  Again, consistency has never been a staple of this man's work.\n\nMuch of the rest of this shoddy picture is nothing more than a tribute to manipulative film splicing.  Any hack with the proper equipment can edit footage in such a way as to make even the most intelligent person look like a buffoon.  Moore is a master at this.  Such sophomoric tactics are most fully on display near the beginning of the film.  There is a whole sequence that features muted footage of various members of the Bush Administration, including the commander in chief himself, primping themselves just before going on camera.  In one shot, Paul Wolfowitz, that hated Neocon and Zionist, licks his hand and then uses it to fix his hair.  If Moore expects his viewers to laugh at such silly cheap shots, he has even less respect for the audience than I originally assumed.  There are plenty of valid ways to oppose the current cadre that controls the White House; unfortunately, none of these ways are explored in this shameful attempt at discourse.\n\nMost of FAHRENHEIT is either comically false or mildly irritating.  However, some of the film is beyond merely obnoxious.  In one of the most outrageous scenes in the movie, we are treated to images of pre-war Iraq, which is (surprise!  surprise!) a blissful utopia where carefree children fly kites and elderly women sit on their porches soaking up the joyous atmosphere.  Sympathy for tyrannical dictators -- in this case, Mr. Hussein -- has always been a characteristic of the left.  Moore has taken this bias to a whole new level of sophistry.  Wicked regimes that murder their own people in the millions are never as nefarious as capitalist America's vicious imperialism.  The filmmaker also spends much time exploiting the sorrow of a woman who has lost a son in Iraq.  The ironic thing is that the woman strongly encouraged each of her male family members to join the military.  One can easily sympathize with her pain, but shouldn't a person know that those who join the armed services are taking the risk of dying in battle, whether just or unjust?  Having witnessed Moore's attempt to milk this poor woman's grief for all its worth, the average viewer may be more enraged at the filmmaker's grotesque behavior than saddened by the tragedy of a young man's untimely death.\n\nLike all Moore pictures, FAHRENHEIT is a manipulative piece of propaganda that a certain, feeble-minded percentage of the public will undoubtedly buy hook, line, and sinker.  What is actually in the movie is not nearly as ominous as its fairly impressive popularity: the debate in the nation is increasingly being hijacked by duplicitous self promoters and clownish bunko artists.  The snobbery and self-righteousness of the left have finally caught up with them.  While many of the right's most prominent figures have sacrificed their traditional principles of limited government in order to support a president who constantly seeks to expand federal power,  the narcissism of America's statist liberals have rendered conservative hypocrisy insignificant.  We have truly reached the point where the inmates are running the asylum.  That Moore is a mainstream figure in today's media world speaks volumes about our current state of affairs.";Lunacy of the Left on Full Display

863;91.0;5.0;37.0;Bowling for Columbine was a better documentary than F911, however F911 is a far more powerful motion picture with much wider reaching implications. Forget the slapstick humor, South Park'ish cartoon interludes or much of Moore, because here Mike just lets the neo-conservatives, right wing media, senators and the odd President of the United States of America make fun of themselves without them even having to try that hard. However the moment that a dead Iraqi baby is held up to the screen is the moment that you realize that Moore is no longer concerned with giving us that many giggles and also that this documentary is going to cause significant problems for Bush's reelection campaign.\n\nWe are hit with a barrage of appalling film reels, excluded by the mainstream US news, that impressed the judges at Cannes, because 99% of F911 is all about what you WHERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE. F911 will give you a news update of 4 years from 2001 to 2004 that has been missing from your lives, simply because the material is considered anti-American or unpatriotic to show on national television (but Iraqis have seen plenty of it on their own!)... and ALL of it packs a whopping punch to boot.\n\nIt is clear from watching the first few minutes of F911 that Mike has one goal in mind - to identify Bush as a problem that needs to be gotten rid off, so Moore devotes massive screen time over to his favorite Texas tongue twister and lets him get rid of himself by simply playing back for us some things that this guy has been jabbering on about over the years.......... BRING IT ON! Those where the 3 words that sent the Iraqi people ape, burning convoys, hanging US civilian bodies from bridges, kidnapping journalists and decapitating foreign workers on video camera. If it is not clear that Bush is an incredibly very stupid leader then WHO OR WHAT IS?\n\nAfter a smashing opening sequence where Bush's cabinet are all seen putting on makeup before they go on camera - showing us that these people are JUST ACTORS!, we learn that Bush had businesses funded by the Bin Ladens and was very intimate with the Saudi Royals. In fact the name he himself blacked out from his army records was none other than his business partner who made the Saudi/Bin Laden deals for him! It is blatantly obvious that a rich Saudi oil businessman is really not interested in financing a small time US oil player, but is interested in the President's son. What Moore points out is that there can be no doubt that this partnership has turned into a very bitter rivalry... with the REST OF MANKIND STUCK INBETWEEN AND GETTING THE FULL BRUNT OF WHAT IS THEIR FINANICAL/BUSINESS PROBLEM! In fact Moore even shows us how the Bush family continued their relationship with the terrorists AFTER 911!\n\nF911 is not a conspiracy theory. It is not about how much Bush knew about 911 or even if he was responsible for it. It is not about possible CIA operations to crash planes around America, nor are any conspiracies even touched on. In fact Moore just paints the President as a man who just likes to party with the rich, doing what the rich want him to do, helping them to get richer. On 911 his priority was with his rich friends. He allowed members of the rich Bin Laden family to leave America, because the rich Saudi ambassador asked him. As Moore so aptly points out... would Clinton have let the parents and friends of Timothy McVeigh take a flight out of the country, all together, without at least getting them on the record?\n\nThe actual events of 911 are treated with dignity by Moore. Instead of replaying everything we have seen a hundred times before, Moore just lets the screen go black and plays us a sound recording from within the Trade Centre at the time of the attack... a deeply unsettling experience. Then we are quickly thrown into Iraq, bypassing Afghanistan as nothing more than an excuse to build another oil pipeline, and we are after Saddam while OBL remains at large. We then get to see troops on the ground playing heavy metal music on their headsets while machine gunning everything in sight, bagging Iraqis over their heads, raiding their homes looking for dissidents and generally showing people what it is like back home!... and we get plenty of that when Mike starts his rant about The Patriot Act.\n\nThe real cream of F911 however is how the army recruits young marines, by showing up at malls in disadvantaged areas, and with a laser like ability, home in on a poor kid and manage to convince the teen to join up. It is frightening how pro these hunters are (one hunter even hints to an underage teen that he LOOKS much older!). Mike then sets out to Capital Hill to see if he can recruit a Senator's son or daughter for the marines... and obviously fails because no one with any sense would send their kids to that war... but Mike introduces us to a family that does think it makes sense, only when their son is KIA, it all changes very quickly. Near the White House the mother meets an old lady advertising the horrors of war, only to be confronted by protesters who say she is a fake. The confrontation lasts a few seconds with the mother of the marine who was KIA, but the denial on the part of the pro-war protester to acknowledge the mother's dead son at first, and then trying to justify it, shows how terribly ill some people really are.\n\nF911 is so full of information it can not be reviewed in 1000 words, however it is safe to say that this is the most important documentary ever made about 911 and the US government.;F911 - The REAL Super Stealth Fighter
1219;92.0;1.0;37.0;"Anyone who bases their November vote on this movie is an idiot. The first 45 minutes of this movie could have been left on the cutting room floor. Gore did NOT win in Florida (as the NYTimes, the LATimes, AP, and several FL newspapers all proved with their own recounts), but does Michael Moore care about this fact? No. He continues to propagate the myth that the election was ""stolen"" by Bush. Moore then goes on a long, convoluted and exceedingly boring examination of the Bush family relationship with the Saudi royal family and the Bin Ladens. According to Michael Moore, all Saudis are evil terrorists and anyone associated with them in any way is guilty by association. This segment of the film is entirely pointless.\n\n The most annoying aspect of the film are the flat out, bald faced lies. Michael Moore says at one point that, Iraq ""had never threatened any American."" In August of 1990, Saddam Hussein threatened 10,000 Americans living in Iraq and Kuwait when he announced his intention to use them as human shields if the UN forces invaded Iraq. Many Americans were taken into custody by the Iraqi's (and held for months) in preparation for this. Also, Iraq shot at UN airplanes (provided by the US) patrolling the no-fly zones on a daily basis. If he had bothered to do some research, Moore would have known this. Personally, I think Michael Moore DID know this, he just left it out in an attempt to make his movie stronger. Just like he left out images of the torture committed by Saddam's regime. Saddam had people thrown from buildings, beaten with hammers, torn apart by dogs, toungues cut out, eyeballs gouged out. The list goes on and on. For Michael Moore to leave all of this out just proves how weak his argument is in the first place. If he is so hell-bent on telling the truth, he should include Saddam's actions as well. The only reason he doesn't bring up Saddam's human rights abuses, as well the environmental catastrophes he purposely caused, is because they justify the war.\n\n As for his protrayal of African-Americans? I'll just say that if a conservative had done this movie it would be labeled racist. Michael Moore makes it look like Black people are all destitute, broke, unemployed and living in projects that look ""just like Baghdad"" (according to one young man).\n\n Michael Moore is typical of what has become of the Democratic party. A bitterly angry group of people who preach that the views and opinions of everyone are important, except for rich white men. Hate is wrong, unless the object of your hate is a rich white man. I'm not saying that rich white men haven't added their fair share of misery to this world. But if hate is wrong, it has to be wrong on all acounts.\n\n This movie requires you to check your brain at the door. You have to suspend all disbelief and buy into Moores depiction of Bush as an evil minded troll for this movie to be even halfway watchable. Nevermind that George Bush gave basic civil rights to 23 million Iraqis and 28 million Afghanis (the kind of rights we enjoy in the US that enabled Moore to even make this movie in the first place - I wonder how political documentarians fared in Saddam's Iraq???). Nevermind that Iraq now has the first chance at representative government in it's history. Nevermind that one of the worst human rights abusers and environmental abusers in history is now in jail where he belongs. Apparently, none of that was more important than the fact that Michael Moore doesn't like George Bush. My response: So what?";Boring, Aimless, Racist and Disingenuous

He freely admitted that this film was an opinionated editorial piece, though one can't really dispute the facts that are presented within. Moore's a bit hamfisted in general and I believe that ""creative editing"" techniques were used to bolster his arguments, but I also wholeheartedly embrace his stance and share his outrage. I live in NYC and remember 9-11 vivdly. When I saw this film in the theatre I was unable to hold back the tears when the footage of the attack was shown. It reignited the outrage I felt when the Bush administration decided to attack Iraq while continually kissing the ring of the Saudis.\n\nA vote fo Bush is a vote for perpetual war. Al Queda is established in over 50 countries. Countries that ""tolerate and harbor terrorists"" are too plentiful to list.

I believed this before John Kerry said it and i believe it more strongly than ever.\n\nOK, maybe that was a tangent. The point is simply this: I liked this picture; the argument was solid, the pacing was right on point and I feel the same anger that Mr Moore does.

I will say that one should watch this film after having formed their own opinion because I imagine it has the ability to make up the mind of the entirely clueless. Moore portrays President Bush as an arrogant bumbling idiot without one good quality. Personally I don't believe that to be so but I also have a healthy perspective on where his administration has erred America as well. Every one can be filmed during their worst moments and made to look foolish so the scenes filmed by Moore about President Bush didn't impress me. I don't believe ANYONE could have known how to react on 9/11 and not look foolish, we all paid a price on that day that shouldn't be mocked, it is history and that day will never be changed it is only our futures that stand a chance. I believe this film will force you to get involved, to take a stand and to care how America is represented, the fog has been lifted and now we are all responsible.\n\nThis film does not get interesting, unless you like to ""Bushbash,"" until the Iraq war comes into play. We see children playing on swing sets and women going to market, Iraqi smiles and laughter and then BOOM! For people who have chosen to watch the war only through the eyes of our popular media this film will open your eyes to a truth really too horrible for any of us to imagine. Moore manages to show the devastation that Iraq has felt because of American decisions. Their blood drips on each and every one of us especially our precious soldiers. It is important to realize here that the poor and uneducated are fighting the same. An effective moment in this film is when Moore attempts to recruit the children of American congressmen for service in Iraq.....and the answer is? As for our soldiers they are trained to kill, asked to kill and faced with death every day something unfathomable to imagine dealing with. Moore presents the difficulties that our soldiers face in Iraq as well as the abuses that Iraqis are suffering. The footage is not easy to get through without feeling touched and often ashamed. Watching a mother read a letter from her son killed in battle is almost impossible to endure but we must in order for it all to change. Regardless of your political beliefs allow this film to affect you!\n\nThis DVD has many very interesting ""extras"" that further the horror of what is taking place before the world's eyes in Iraq. But what can be done? Moore is doing something, taking a stand is doing something, developing compassion is doing something and asking questions is doing something. The only bad question is the one not asked! Moore asks and even answers many questions with this extraordinary film. The fact that it was accepted so well internationally must mean something. Like it or not being a proud American doesn't just stop at our own borders, our pride exists in the universe as well and maybe after watching this film that fact will matter.

The great thing that I seeing now is that people are now finally aware of the corruption that our American President George W. has done. Of course several other respected news sources have already talked about what Moore does in G.W. interest with Osama and his constant pursuit of profit.\n\nThe war in Iraq is nothing more but a war for profit as I heard\n\nthis on KPFK radio from one military member. The BBC recently\n\ndid a documentary on the George Bush family fortune and what's covered is what's essentially what Moore covers. George W. Bush\n\nis just another cheap American who promised our country  iberty, justice and peace and has delivered four years of misery. Top it all behind closed door as one critic he has\n\naligned himself with greedy corporations like Enron has tried\n\nto drill for oil in Alaska, has had other business endeavors\n\nat the cost of the American people and now weve had enough.\n\nThe shamble in Florida as one person , pretty much was a foreshadowing of what was to come from this disgraceful American. I personally find it pitiful to call this man our President.\n\nAnyhow, Moore also pokes fun at how many congress members often do nothing and often pass laws that they don't even read with his focus of the ""Patriot Act"".\n\nCheap critics who call this bias are only showcasing their corrupton as individuals when they attack Moore. Obviously they\n\ncan't deny anything that Moore points out in his movies, so their childish reactions is to call him fat, and uneducated. Actually their the uneducated ones.\n\nTwo thumbs way up for this movie and look for any barrage of Flashbacks in the film to show that contrary to the belief that\n\nthe military liberates countries they only invade them and kill\n\ninnocent people (Chile, Nicaragua, Salvador).";Way to go Michael!!!

I would not disagree with anyone who called this film propoganda, but it's incredibly high-quality, thought-provoking propoganda. Moore's objective is obviously to paint the most unflattering portrait of Bush possible. For example, by using numerous clips of Bush lounging at his ranch, sipping beer, always looking unpresidential. But Moore does shed light on the truth in many ways and continues to amaze his fans with his boldness and his willingness to explore the most unsettling aspects of our country.\n\n  Seeing Moore at the Republican National Convention made me so happy!

I thought it was funny that one of the clips showed Tony Blair with Bush ""hanging out at his Ranch."" Bush said it himself in the film that it is possible to do his job outside to Oval Office, the same as Clinton doing his job from Camp David most of the time. There is plenty more I would like to point out, but I'm not real sure how much space I have to write on this thing.

1141;104.0;5.0;36.0;Ok, most of this film is Michael Moore's opinion. If you have been following Bush since he WAS given the job of President by our wonderful Supreme Court, you understand What Moore is showing to the World. Most the facts have already been addressed in the 15 or more books on Bush. No President has ever had so many negative books written about him,( in 3 1/2 yr and still in the White House) than Bush. I have to admit the film is amazing, shocking and the American people show be ashamed if they Really Elect this unqualified person on Nov 2, 2004. Bush has simply NOT done the job for us as Commander in Chief. Does anyone really believe he has made all the decisions on health care, social security, the WAR, and so on and so on. This simple mined man depends on Wolfie, Rumsie, Cheney, and Rice. Bush has admitted he doesn't read..Wow what does that say about the President. HE is in this Bubble of his World. Protected by his Soldiers and Loyal servants. Every country is against this man, except 48% of GOP. WE can have change on Nov 4th, after all even if he wins, 2008 he will be gone, so lets get it over with, See the Movie.  You don't have to believe everything Moore is saying in the film. Just watch, look at the 9 seconds of Bush just rolling his eyes, after the second plane struck the Twin Towers. Of course the Right will call all this...Bush Bashing. Well, it is Bush Bashing I suppose since most of the facts are correct. YOU have a right to disagree with The White House, they are too secret and are the cause for NOT making the USA safer.

1254;106.0;5.0;36.0;"Why are we being told about terror alerts, over and over?  Why are they constantly on the news stations with the time and the newscrawl?  What purpose do they serve?  Does it make sense to ban toenail clippers on airplanes but allow butane lighters and matches?  Someone in a state of fear will agree to almost anything; someone in a state of fear told to do two contradictory things will just give up.  Cheney tells us to be on the alert, Bush tells us to go shopping. So the American public is terrorized, but it isn't by who you think.  And that's one of the many things Michael Moore reminds us in Fahrenheit 9/11.\nThere is little here that hasn't been said, yet this may be the most important film of the year.  What Moore has done is skillfully weave a funny, tragic, and shocking tale out of a complicated series of claims and counterclaims.  Beginning with the 2000 election and the complete rollover of the Democrats during what was a silent coup, Moore reminds the viewer of everything that happened if only we had paid attention and gotten angry instead of fearful.\nThere are two kinds of people who watch films like these: those who go in already agreeing with Moore, and those who haven't made their minds up.  (The third type, the ones who already ""know ""this film is full of bias, lies, and distortions, won't bother watching it at all.)  There's plenty of red meat for the liberals: Bush looking clueless when told of the second plane crash on 9/11 (and the 7 minutes he sat in an elementary school classroom, waiting to be told what to do); the Bush family's ties to the Saudi royal family and the surprising revelation that the Secret Service guards the Saudi embassy (but no others); the Fresno peace group full of cookie-baking fiftysomethings that was infiltrated by an undercover sheriff's deputy; the mom on the plane forced to drink her own breastmilk because it might be a weapon.\nBut it's what's there for the fence sitters that's more important.  It's not just the War for Oil story; it's the contrast between Bush and his tuxedo-clad elites (who Bush jocularly refers to as his ""base"") and Moore's devastated hometown of Flint, Michigan.  (Longtime Moore fans will remember all Flint's woes from his seminar film Roger & Me, which chronicled the city's collapse when GM closed a huge auto plant.)  There in Flint, Moore follows two Army recruiters who attempt to sign up its unemployed youth, who clearly have nowhere else to go.  And from there, Moore lets Lila Lipscomb, a former welfare recipient who pulled herself up via job training, tell her story.  She encouraged her children to join the military because she had no money for college.  Her daughter served proudly in Desert Storm.  Her son went to Iraq, and his last letter home questioned why the troops were there.  The most powerful moment in a film chock full of them was Lila facing down an angry woman who accuses Moore of ""staging"" an Iraqi woman's makeshift shrine to her family members killed there.  Lila turns on her, revealing that her son was killed in Karbala on April 2nd, and then storms over to stare at the White House.  Armed snipers patrol the roof, and we are reminded of the mindless terror alerts that were not there to fight terrorists but to make us fearful.\nIf you are not 100% convinced that Bush is absolutely right in all things, this is a film you must take the time to see.  You will be angry, you will laugh, and you will cry.  But all of these are far more cathartic than being afraid.  15 July 2004 Maddi Hausmann Sojourner";Don't be afraid.  Be angry.  Very, very angry.
1261;107.0;5.0;36.0;"Being a non-american, I think this is one of the most powerful & self-critical documentary film ever made in this country or any country. And for once, none of the patriotic crap that seem to attempt to brainwash the general average americans (e.g independence day).  I wish we  all can""trust the president"" as Britney said with such naivety. It shows how blinded we can become.\nTrue, Moore may have manipulated and exagerated the facts, and turns it into a very biased anti-Bush movie. And here is where the film technique is so great, with excellent editing technique, justaposing different parts of the film to great persuasiveness, (notably the part where Britney suddenly appears chewing her gum like an idiot). And what humor and sarcasm. The end result is that after watching the movie, you feel like killing the president! (and if this is about a Korean or Taiwanese politician, sure there would be riots on the street by now!)But there are also objective parts too, notably a touching interview with the mother who lost her son, who loaths Bush for sending her son to a useless war, plus quotations of soldiers who realise the meaninglessness of this war. Plus a powerful clip of how none of the politicians involved in the war want to send their children to war\nApart from the fact of ""war on oil"" which every knows anyway (or are in denial of this fact), there are a few very disturbing information, namely the Bushes family's personal ties with the Bin Ladins, and their personal oil/energy business. All politicians lie(it's their job) but what appears to be most disturbing is how Bush appears to do one thing, but in fact has an alternative motive, possibly a personal one. If he lies for the good of the nation, it may be forgiven, but to launch a war for personal gain is unacceptable.\nFew weakness here. More elaborate information regarding Saudis' funding the terrorists and H. Bin Ladin's relation with his family would be more provoking. Bin Ladin may not be as mad or evil as we think. He's sick of the dark oil bussiness ties between the Saudis & America and his terrorist activities may have wanted to stop such ties. It's just his way of doing things are totally wrong.\nIn the end, a powerful quotation from Orwell's ""1984"" sumarises how a dictator can manipulate war in order to give stability to a society by inflicting constant fear of something: the Vietnam & Korean war, Cold war, and now ""war on Terror"". In a frightening way, a totalitarian state is not that different from the current situation in America. While, I'm not saying that Bush is like Stalin or Mao, it makes a chilling but apt comparison between a democratic world's leader and that of a dictator.";The ultimate anti-bush documentary
1363;108.0;1.0;36.0;"How many reviews have been written by those who just assumed whatever Moore put in the film was based on truth? A typical example of his use of innuendo to distort the truth was his claim that ""$1.4 Billion was given by the Saudi Royal family directly to the Bush family...(long pause)..., their family friends, and companies they've done business with."" It is true the Saudis are rich and invest almost all of their money in U.S. companies. It would be difficult to refute that if the Bush's once ate at McDonald's that a Saudi investment there would support Moore's claim. The way Moore wrote the narrative, though. makes it seem that the Saudi's gave money to the Bush's or their friends when in fact they didn't. The mention of the Carlyle Group is also indicative of his outright lies. Of course, the narrative is written to never outright claim that George Bush, who only had a passing participation with that company once when he was Governor of Texas and then was totally divested with it way back then, was actually getting money from them. Ask any of the viewers, though, and you'd think Moore actually proved some kind of collusion. That company incidentally was described as a Conservative company owned by friends of Bush. If you allow that members of Carter's administration who started the company, and members of Clinton's administration who make up the bulk and controlling interest are ""friend of Bush,"" and ignore the remark about it being ""conservative,"" then Moore is once again off the hook. The fact is though, that the only thing the Bush administration ever had to do with any govenment contract that impacted Carlyle was to cancel a huge proposed contract that cost the company billions of dollars. The innuendo made it seem like Buish somehow put money in his pocket with sweet under the table deals with Carlyle, when the opposite was true.\nMoore claimed Bush intervened to fly Saudis out of the U.S. immediately after 9-11, but we have already heard Richard Clarke explain that he made the call on protecting the Saudis and that the decision never went higher than him. As a matter of fact, he also denied that anyone was flown out. What he said happened was that the initial claims of Arabic-speaking hijackers crashing the planes caused a fear of vigilanteism against innocent Arabs, so many were bussed to safe areas for protection and vetting by the FBI until the flight restrictions were lifted and they could be flown home. Clarke said all the Saudis protected were cleared by the FBI before being released. Far cry from what Moore insinuated.\nRemember that encounter with the Congressman, when Moore ambushed him and asked if he has any family members he would like to have join the military and be shipped to Iraq? That Congressman calmly told Moore that he did have two family members in the military and that they backed the War on Terrorism and were set to go to Iraq. Moore cut out that part of the film and just showed him strutting away after Moore ignored his cival response and said something rude to get the walk-away reaction.\nSo far, there is a case to be made that not one single thing in Moore's film which is aimed at discrediting Bush is fair or truthful. However, he was very skillful at only suggesting the claims he made and never coming right out and saying them, in order to deflect lawsuits. The fact that he knew what he filmed was libelous, and worked so hard for legal deniability, goes a long way to discredit him personally and to show him for what he is.\nPro-Kerry fast-talkers and ""Anybody But Bush"" haters love this movie and hope it's unfair and unscrupulous assertions will impact the election. It is possible that when the movie is fairly examined for content veracity and people's eyes are opened the opposite will be true.";Purposeful disinformation. Moore lied blatantly throughout.

I can't really judge whether he's a good president to the average citizen, so I won't. But what I find curious is when people say this film is full of lies and half truths (what is a half truth anyway!). I have discovered 34 negative books on George W. Bush and I haven't finished looking. I've read about 5 and they all say the same things this film film says. Has any other president been exposed to this degree? How can this film be dishonest when so many intelligent authors have confirmed the information. Are they all wrong? Richard A. Clark, John W. Dean etc etc.. Go and look them up because they all say the same thing but Moore does it with a bit of humour.

Detractors of this film can say what they want, but it's hard to argue with footage of Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam.  It's hard to argue with the ""Commander in Chief"" sitting on his duff reading a children's book after hearing the country is under attack.  It's hard to argue that people in our government haven't used the fear and anxiety of 9/11 to manipulate the people of this country.\n\nI would have preferred the film to have focused more on the facts and less on opinion and entertainment, but that doesn't put people in the seats.

862;113.0;5.0;35.0;I went to see this movie on opening weekend, at a tiny four screen theatre that runs mainly independent films. When we arrived in the early afternoon, people were crammed into the entrance and flooding out to the street. There were all types of people, young liberals, old liberals , conservatives of all ages and professions, some holding pro- Bush signs, many expressing the opposite opinion. We were told the shows were sold out untill that night, despite the movie playing on two of the four screens. As we were waiting to buy our tickets for the 8:30 showing, one of the theatres let out. Some people looked outraged, but not at michael moore. They were amazed that so much had been kept from them. Even today, months after F9/11 has exposed some of the glaring omissions the media made in covering Iraq, There are many things in this movie that are found nowhere else, that no company has the nerve to show, because this footage starkly contraficts the rosy picture the Bush administration has tried to paint for us. Moore shows viewers things that we have not seen, guides us through a twisted path of information, but lets us draw our own conclusions about Bush and his administration. Everyone should see this movie. If you are a democrat, you will love it. If you are a republican or independent, and open-minded enough to consider another person's point ov view, you will be deeply moved, and you just may find that you can no longer support George W.

1355;115.0;5.0;35.0;"Michael Moore is an important individual; one who provides and invaluable service to this nation.  He reminds each and everyone of us the importance exercising the rights granted us by the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, especially during a time when we live with a presidential administration that seems more focused on denying us those rights than dealing with its stated purpose of protecting us from terrorists.  Michael Moore, despite his unkempt appearance, and reputation as nothing more than a leftist rabble-rouser, continues to demonstrate the importance of agitation.  His constant questioning, and some would say harassing, of long-standing institutions and organizations, throws open for debate topics that people may be afraid or unwilling to discuss.  Some view agitation (erroneously) as unpatriotic, and peg individuals who engage in as Un-American.  Yet, agitation is at the very foundation of American principles and is what insures that our rights continue to be protected.  Agitation is what enabled and motley band of outraged colonist to rise up and unite thirteen disparate entities to throw off the oppression of British rule.  Agitation was the method famed abolitionist Frederick Douglas espoused when fighting against slavery.  Agitation enraged the American public against injustices and incited them to force change.  Now, Michael Moore uses agitation to inflame the public to lies, fraud, and general incompetence of an executive administration that claims to only have our best interests at heart.  Michael Moore's chosen vehicle for this is his controversial, inflammatory, and undeniably powerful documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".\n\nWhat happened that allowed the terrible tragedy of 9/11 to happen?  Are we winning the war on terror that was declared in its aftermath?  Why did Iraqi President Saddam Hussein order those planes to be flown in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?...  huh?  Let's back up a second.  It wasn't Saddam Hussein that ordered it. It was Osama Bin Laden ordering his terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, to execute those attacks.  So, why are we invading Iraq?  Well, that's a fascinating question and is as the very core of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  It seems that the `reign of error' (and now `terror') of the George W. Bush administration has been insisting on this connection for more than two years.\n\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" opens with that seminal period back in November 2000, when the presidential election was thrown into chaos by those dastardly hanging `chads' (and several thousand disenfranchised voters) in Florida.  Moore sets up the events leading to that terrible September day with his characteristic biting wit and with surprising tension.  He shows clip after clip of Bush administration members indicating that they saw no connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda, yet they insisted the connection was incontrovertible after 9/11.  He shows evidence that Bush Administration considered Bin Laden's threat such low priority that they didn't even hold the first all-hands meeting on potential terrorist threats until a week before the attack.  He chronicles a series of events leading up to 9/11, including Dubya's month long August vacation as events were coming a head, and his early September visit to Florida to visit his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, on Sept. 10th, 2001.  Then, the screen goes black, and Moore lets horrifying sounds of 9/11 tell the story of that day as vividly and powerful as any video.\n\nWhat is most damning about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is how effectively Moore presents the case of how bungled and mishandled the `War on Terror' following 9/11 in favor of promoting their own personal agendas.  Much like in his book ""Dude? Where's my Country?"" a companion piece to this film, Moore highlights the less than kosher connection between Bush and Saudi royal family (15 of the hijackers were Saudi) and to the Bin Laden family themselves.  Then Moore goes on the assault to bring to light the dirty little secret that our government is doing very little to rid the world of Al Qaeda with less than one full division of soldiers being committed to attack in Afghanistan, while most of our resources are being dedicated to an Iraq war that is fast becoming the second edition of Vietnam.  The reasons Moore illuminates for this are thought provoking and scary.\n\nEven more depressing than the lack of progress in the War on Terror is the legislation that is being rammed through to Congress to `protect' us.  The inappropriately title ""Patriot Act"" is the worst restriction of rights since the Alien and Sedition Acts, yet it got passed because of on sadly telling reason, as representative John Conyers conveyed to Michael Moore in the most fatherly of ways; ""Congress doesn't read most of what it passes.""  Now that is scary.\n\nThe most heart-wrenching portion of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the ongoing sub-story of a mother whose son is serving in the Army and is stationed in Iraq.  Moore chronicles the progression of this woman's pride in her son's duty and belief in his mission to her abject grief and fierce opposition to his mission following his tragic death in combat in Baghdad (several months after Bush declared the war over and `Mission Accomplished').\n\nIt is so tempting to sit here and review every single point put forth by this incredibly important film.  Doing so would far exceed the word limit on reviews, and would do poor justice to the ultimate power of this documentary.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Michael Moore's most accomplished and polished work to date.  So, it should come as no surprise that it is also his most powerful.

While there was supposedly a lot of ""fact checking"" done with this movie, even Richard Clark had to admit that the central premise of the Saudis leaving the USA while other aircraft were not allowed to fly was a lie. The scenes of death and destruction in Iraq with the Americans there vs. the garden of Eden that was Iraq under Saddam seemed to have overlooked the mass graves of babies in their mothers arms with bullets in their heads that Saddam ordered. But I do think that this movie is powerful. If only Moore would have been around in the USA at the same time that Leni Riefenstahl was working for the Nazis in Germany, we would not have gone to war against Hitler and his ""final solution"" in dealing with the ""Jewish question"" would have been completed. No Israel, no Palestinian intifada, no problems. And no suffering for American families who lost hundreds of thousands of their loved ones in fighting someone who was just trying to grab a little ""lebensraum"" for the master race.

I did not vote for that man, but I think he looked destroyed; as we all were.  I wish he had done something sooner, but I relate to the feeling of helplessness he was going through.  It's unfortunate he wasn't quite strong enough to get up and go, but it was a little understandable.  I'm trying to be nice, here.\n\nThe hard core facts presented here are irrefutable.  I can't understand it when those who disagree do so saying ""he made that up.""  How do you make up a private meeting with just Dick and Bush in front of the 9/11 commission which Bush had been against forming in the first place.  Why wasn't Bush able to face the commish on his own?  Strange that.  Also, why all the flights for Saudi family members on 9/11 when nobody else was allowed to fly, including Bush's own daddy?  Strange, that.\n\nThere's a whole lot of strange here.  The one emotion every single viewer of this editorial documentary will assuredly come away with is anger.\n\nIf you are a conservative, please consider renting this and watching it with some friends.  I know you hate to give money to the guy, I've heard you.  Just, consider a group effort, and try to hear him.\n\nThat way you'll be sure to be against him for what you know and not what you've heard.  It will also fire up your validity if you fall that way, for Bush.  I can't understand a vote for Bush, but I realize it's really a vote for Cheney, so OK.\n\nThis DVD has more than the movie had.  We particularly enjoyed the comedian skits.  Quite funny stuff.";A heartwrenching look at the days just before and after 9/11
618;118.0;4.0;34.0;"In former days, that is to say ""once upon a time,"" the greatest coup in politics was to run an attack ad once and get all of the network news shows to run it over and over again for free.  This has been true from the infamous ""Daisy"" commercial that was run for Lyndon B. Johnson against Barry Goldwater in 1964 to the even more infamous ""Willie Horton"" ad that was used to attack Michael Dukakis on behalf of George Bush in 1988.  But that standard has changed now with Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  As of the last box office report, this documentary has made $119,078,393 in the United States, which does not include the take from other nations or the number of DVDs and videotapes that have been bought.  In other words, Moore has not only created a 2-hour political attack ad against President George W. Bush, he is getting millions of people to PAY him to see it.  Then again, President Bush has an entire new network behind his candidacy with FOX News, so you can also argue that Moore is behind the times rather than ahead.\n\nI fully understand that this being a Michael Moore documentary indicting George W. Bush for the War in Iraq is enough for most people to make up their minds about it, but I still think everybody, regardless of ideological persuasion, should see it before they bury or praise ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  I also do not want to get into the maelstrom around the documentary and restrict this review to just what I saw when I watched it this morning.  Yes, it is a political diatribe and like any political statement during an election cycle (the battle lasts longer than a year) it is filled with distortions, omissions, lies, and every other sin associated with political rhetoric.  But we know that the judgment for such things is not whether they are ""true"" but whether they are ""real"" enough to make a difference.\n\nUltimately I found ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was a bit too disjointed in constructing the coherent argument it appears to be actually making in the end.  Just like is the case with most of the papers I get from my students, the true thesis comes near the end when Moore contends that we should never send our troops into harm's way without knowing they are fighting for the right reasons.  That particular point is implicit at best for a lot of the film and you have to retroactively go back and connect the dots.  The reasons why the war is wrong in the first part of the film are not the same reasons that are offered at the end.  I am sure Moore abstains from providing a linear argument as part of the creative impulse, but I think there was one to be advanced here that would better serve his purpose.\n\nSome of the most affecting parts of the documentary speak to things that transcend this specific war.  Pictures of dead and wounded children are always going to be upsetting (add the long distance shot of a beheading and the charred corpses of Americans being dragged through the streets in Iraq and the R rating is easily justified).  American soldiers are always going to be too young to go off to war and kill or be killed.  Politicians are never going to want it to be their children who go off to die in the wars they vote to authorize.  I thought Moore trying to get Congressmen to sign up their kids to go fight the war was the lamest part of the film, partially because you know it is not going to happen and also because the technique has been done to death on ""60 Minutes"" and all of its kindred news magazines.  Nor does the idea that young American troops get psyched up by playing obnoxious heavy metal songs offend me because I have long understood that soldiers will do what they have to do to get through a battle.\n\nIn terms of what is happening in Iraq since the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner was put up on that aircraft carrier to be seen behind Bush when he declared victory, Moore decided slants everything towards what American troops are doing to outrage the ordinary Iraqi citizens who are supposed to be overjoyed by being freed.  However, I think Moore missed a potent line of argument by becoming fixated on the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner instead of Bush's invitation to the insurgents to ""Bring it on,"" which I think is clearly the most regrettable thing the President has said while in office.  All of this just underscores that the ""war,"" however you want to conceive it, is obviously much more complex than can dealt with even in a three-hour tour (a three-hour tour including all of the extras on the DVD, the best of which are the comments and jokes of the Arab-American comedians).\n\nHis techniques are no different from what we are seeing in the relentless onslaught of paid political advertising.  The parody of the title credits for ""Bonanza"" redone for ""Afghanistan"" is good for a laugh and any politician or ordinary human being having make up put on them before appearing on camera is going to look like an idiot.  I was thinking that combining slow motion shots with ominous music and an equally ominous voice over would do to Jesus of Nazareth (""""Render unto God the things that are God's'?....another religious fanatic from the Middle East..."").  The most persuasive person in the film for me and I suspect for many is Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a Flint, Michigan boy who dies in Iraq when a Blackhawk helicopter is downed.  A lifelong supporter of the American military, she changes her mind about Iraq, haunted by not only her son's death but also his last letter in which he lashed out at Bush and the war.  In the end it is impossible to tar her with the same brush that can be used to castigate Moore for his political polemic.\n\nIn terms of being provocative there is no doubt Moore has clearly achieved his goal.  The question is whether he is actually persuading a significant number of people to adopt his view or whether he is simply preaching (and selling) to the choir.  Ironically, we will probably no more know the answer to that question than he ever will the real reasons for the decision to invade Iraq.";Michael Moore's two-hour political message plays for pay

647;120.0;5.0;34.0;This movie is a blessing.  I don't see how the opinions in this movie can be seen as lies, unless you're relentlessly trying to defend George W.\n\nI'm sick of all the Michael Moore bashing.  'Rallying around the president' opinion...Bush is using it for all its worth.  I'm happy to see a film to tell it like it is.\n\nA scene where Bush is telling people to watch terrorists, then continues on with his game of golf is pathetic.\n\nAgain, I'm happy that we have a film that isn't afraid to give the facts:  about the homeland security, the fact that this war is not crucial - like Bush wants us to think, throwing the threat of terrorism in our face.  This is an important film, I don't think that all the right-wing people should talk bad about.\n\nYou should see this film, if you haven't already.;If not the truth, then pretty close to it
686;121.0;5.0;34.0;I found myself crying almost immediately after the film began.  As it rehashed the Gore-Bush debacle of the 2000 election, I felt tears running down my face.  I hadn't realized how deeply affected I was by that whole mess.  The death and destruction wrought by that one Supreme Court decision is a bit overwhelming.  After viewing the entire film and finding myself crying on more than one occasion, I have to say that every single American should see this film.  The movie opened my eyes.  Excellent film.;Americans need to view this film.
726;122.0;5.0;34.0;It is like it is, we all have our own opinions on the view points and I may not be a big political buff I do have my own view points. I'm voting for John Kerry when the time comes because from the first time I saw George W. all those years ago I didn't like him. Michael Moore shows us lies, he shows us truths and he shows us a thought provoking subject. Suffice to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 is seriously controversial and seriously should be viewed wheter your for Bush or not. Moore tackles subjects like commerical adds for big cooperate places, footage from many different things, like the war in Iraq, or the bombings in Baghdad to Bush putting around the golf ball. He tackles issues in his home town of Flint, Michigan. A lot of people may hate this movie but I thought of it to be a button pusher and a sure fire winner. Some footage might be too shocking to watch. The Bonanza rip off called Afghanastan was hilarious with Bush and Cheney's heads pasted on cowboys riding horses. one of 2004's best;breaks all the rules and comes out a real winner
780;123.0;4.0;34.0;"I love all the reviews about the movie that cry out ""LIES' but then nobody lists any. One reviewer jokes about laughing at the wrong parts because he was laughing at Mike's ""lies"". Of course he doesn't say what the lies are or offer any counter points. All the critiques are foul cries of ""traitor"" and ""unpatriotic"" with no explanation. No counterpoints. No actual citations of factual errors. Just people using ""lies"" as a euphemism for not liking the movie. It's quite telling that even the Right and Fox News didn't offer any substantive critiques of the facts presented in the movie. All the arguments where in the emotive character assassinating style we've all come to know an expect. If you go to Mike's site you can feast your eyes on an exhaustive factual backup of the main points of the movie. Gee, do you think Mike wasn't aware that if he put out a movie with a ton of factual holes in it that it wouldnt gleefully be taken to task? Its not like the Right doesnt have the resources. But alas no. The best they can do is call him a traitor and talk about striping his citizenship or deporting him. All of which are of course traditional American values.\n\nPeople need to drop the borrowed criticism and see this movie for themselves. I've heard so many interviews where people were ready to offer up their borrowed opinion on the movie and then professing to not have actually seen it. If you don't want to buy it at full price then rent it or borrow it but if you haven't seen it then you have no foundation for criticism.";Interesting...
1132;124.0;4.0;34.0;"It seems the rightists, with their pretentious parroting of the same phrases, continue to go to the extreme.\n\nJournalism? No, this film is a documentary, and as always, presents the filmmaker's perspective. A documentary is always slanted so, presenting its subject as the creator sees it. For example, a documentary about a charity might present it as needy, effective, misguided, or, perhaps, even futile - presented as the documentatian sees it and wishes to present it. In other words: his/her opinion, using supporting facts. It is important to note that documentaries are NOT scientific research.\n\nCertainly the speculation (of course not facts) of what may have been in the President's mind at that school on 9/11 were the authors opinion; however, the President's words, as recorded, were his own.\n\nSome have said this film was ""lies"", but obviously those writers had either not seen the film, or else they do not know what the word ""lie"" means. It is obvious to any observer that Moore's opinions (and those of others in the film) were merely opinions, not facts. But then the right does has trouble distinguishing between fact and interpretations thereof, as can be seen on Fox News.\n\nOne writer commented that Moore is a ""great filmmaker"". I suppose this is to imply fairness on that writer's part. In my OPINION, while Moore is intelligent, cares about people & fairness, is a strong opponent to neo-facsism, an excellent investigative documentarian, and an all-around decent guy, he is not - again, my opinion - a ""great"" filmmaker.  Whatever his ego may be privately, Moore is unlikely to classify himself as a peer to Fellini, Bergman, Almodovar, etc.\n\nFor eaxmple: I thought there was actually one film here that should have been two. The first half was clever, witty, funny. The second half was quite serious & sad. But given the scope of the material & subject matter, I don't know what Moore might have done otherwise. I strongly recommend the movie, whether one agrees or not. What it presents is certainly worth pondering.";Reviews are entertaining, some uninformed.
1155;125.0;5.0;34.0;"This movie is a great movie in the sense of it exposes most of the facts that the public was not told about how America was duped into the Iraq war. Most of the 1-star reviewers here have been fed ignorance by Fox News and other right wing media, including what the President says. It is truly amazing that we our losing our children for an unknown cause. Saddam was not going to personally hijack an airplane or do something to attack us, so without WMDs he was no threat. It is also amazing how he lied to our country, saying the tax cuts ""by far"" go to the bottom when the bottom 50% only got 14.7% of that tax cut. He has cut hospital funding for our heroes that fought in WW2, Vietnam and other wars. He has also cut funding to our schools in his ""No Child Left Behind"" act. Imagine if you were one of the children or veterans or living in poverty. The children who can't go to an after school program to stay off the street or get new textbooks to teach them the current information. Or a veteran who can't get full healthcare, even though that person voluntarily risked their life for our freedom. Or, you are a person who is trying to make ends meet for their family, and couldn't get a larger tax break to set them free. Or the deficit, growing larger by the minute. I guess my final message is go and see this film, Democrat or Republican, Liberal or Conservative, White or Black, to unite forever to create the final American dream: Peace, Prosperity, Freedom, Justice, and a right to live a life where no one is in poverty and everyone is happy to live in America to set a role model for the world. Maybe it is just a dream, but I believe in it.\n\n Enjoy the show!";What happened to America?
1267;126.0;5.0;34.0;I first saw Fahrenheit more out of curiosity than politics.  I thought I would find it tediously political.  I was wrong.  This is actually an outstanding movie that hits its subject hard and with humor.  The film raises some very troubling and important questions, but it is best when Michael Moore backs away and lets the film's images and the mother who lost her son in the war speak for themselves.  This is emotionally powerful stuff, and at times, the effect is at once both soaring and searing.  Believe me, I was glad for the humor as comic relief.  I am generally conservative politically, and I must admit I was a little uncomfortable with the unremitting Bushbashing.  However, I came away seriously moved, sobered, thoughtful and with an overpowering sense of tragedy in the making, and not many films in the last ten years have done that to me.  So, I give this movie all five stars and a standing ovation.  It is a great movie and I recommend it regardless of your political leaning, for this is the kind of film a mature democracy should receive well and with gratitude.  Now, let us have one just as good for the conservative voices?;Fahrenheit burns fast all the way through
501;127.0;5.0;33.0;What could I say that has not been said about the Bush family?  And why dosen't everyone in the United States see his stupidity, the lack of leadership ability he has demonstrated, not only as a President, but as a private sector leader of failed companies?\n\nAnyone smart or not can see and hear his stupidity. He speaks to people like him, not to the American people as a country.  His Father has bailed him out of everything he has evey done. He does not care about you, he cares more about his dogs on his Texas ranch than he does about me, you, or this country.  Michael Moore, you are a great man. Why don't you run for President.  You would make a great one because you have what it take to get the job done and this film serves as your resume to that fact. I truly respect you and wish you continued success.  If you, the American people, don't buy anything else, buy this film. I myself have been in the professional video, audio and film business for 20 years and Fahrenheit 9/11 is one of the best films of it's kind I have ever seen.;* WAKE UP BUSH SUPPORTERS, YOUR TIME IS UP *
537;128.0;1.0;33.0;"You should watch this film with your eyes open. Mr. Moore has a political bias and clear dislike for the war in Iraq and the Bush Administration; Couple that with fact that there are 56 documented untruths and I think you would be hard pressed to call this a documentary. However, Mr. Moore does show us a few things.\n\nOne we live in a great country that protects his right to promote his political agenda. So if you watch Fahrenheit 9/11 please watch the counterpoint, Fahrenhype 9/11 to see both views.\n\nTwo, war is always horrible in the toll it takes on soldiers and civilians, and should never be entered into lightly. However, after one Gulf War, many resolutions, and a final call to disarm over a 12 year period, one can hardly say the president made a rush decision; whether you agree with the policy or not.\n\nLast, the military is a great way to learn a trade, see the world, and pay for college; that is why Mrs. Lipscomb still promotes it. I should add that West Point and The Naval Academy are some of the hardest colleges to get into and are not attended by only those in the lowest socioeconomic bracket. Many people from all walks of life are drawn to the excitement, the challenge, and the desire to serve thier country. Each and every one of those who enlist know full well that it is potentailly dangerous. That is why you get a rifle in boot and not a tutu.\n\nHonestly, in these highly charged times you owe it to yourself to listen to both sides and make an informed choice. So if you watch Fahrenheit 9/11 take the time to watch Fahrenhype 9/11.";See Both Sides of the Issues
589;129.0;5.0;33.0;"Know before you view it that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a powerful film that brings home great suffering and even greater absuridity.  Moore does a good job of dealing with subjects that are unpleasant by mixing in humor, but you still walk away with a sense of tragedy and anger over what this government is doing to people. I saw it three times in the theatre and will buy it this week and watch it again. It opens your eyes to what is going on. It's heavy, makes you cry, makes you angry, and motivates you to implement some regime change right here at home.\n\nIt portrays the truth most Americans, especially the right-of-center ones, do not want to see. The reactionary right HATES Michael Moore because he exposes their fundamental strategy: the use of fear to divide and manipulate people. Like he did in ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Moore shows how fear is a powerful weapon that can be used to trick people into believing things that are not true and acting against their own best interest. The fact that Moore can deliver this message with wit, flair, and most amazingly, in a way that is entertaining, is iodine in the wounds of the reactionaries.\n\nFor me, the most poignant moment in the film is when Lila Libscomb is weeping over the death of her son, a soldier killed in Iraq, and a nasty woman jumps in front of her and the camera shouting ""this is all staged."" Then she demands Libscomb to tell her where her son was killed. When Libscomb replies without hesitation and gives the exact time and place of her son's death, the nasty woman recoils realizing it isn't staged at all, then stomps away angry. That is an allegory of right-wing reaction to much in the world.\n\nMoore can be criticized for jumping through the facts too quickly and of not going into depth when called for. However, he can not be faulted on the factual content of the film. The reactionaries rail and moan but they never can find anything in Fahrenheit 9/11 that is untrue.\n\nBless you, Michael Moore for showing such heart and such courage.";The Truth Hurts
607;130.0;2.0;33.0;"Before I get started, I have to say... I have no political affiliation. I vote independent. Both parties are so far gone from normal Americans, it's high time we removed them both.\n\nThat being said, this apparently is an important film, because people are talking and that is ultimately what every film hopes to achieve. Yet!! Remember something. Many of the antidotes and messages portrayed are products of keen editing and conjecture by a democrat. Films are illusions and Fahrenheit 9.11 is plain and simple propaganda.\n\nBecause President Bush sat thinking in front of a classroom of children after being told of the attack on New York. We're supposed to believe there is something wrong with that? What is he Superman? Supposed to spring up and run out of the room? CHILDREN!! Would any normal person not think about how to carefully walk this line sitting in front of a classroom of children?  Yet, the movie spins a different tale, VOICED OVER by Michael Moore who TELLS US what Bush is THINKING!!\n\nOsama Bin Laden's family was flown out of the country despite all planes being grounded. What's the assumption here? How about looking at the real truth. Bin Laden's family denounced Osama long ago. They are peaceful people and after what happened, they feared for their lives, rightfully so. Besides, the FAA has since stated that there is no record of this flight or any other.\n\nBush knows the Bin Laden family. So what? Wealthy people like the Bushs, the Bin Ladens, the Kerrys and the rest of our politicians make up about 2% of the worlds population. Is it so shocking and scandalous that they know each other?\n\nPoliticians putting on makeup for the camera... uh... that's normal. Anybody who knows anything about T.V. would know that. Cheap shot.\n\nAnother cheap shot was showing the video of the people of Iraq, playing and shopping before the war. Awful? Yes. Sad? Yes. War is awful, but I'm sure you could have seen the very same thing in Germany before WW2.  Was removing Hitler wrong?\n\nIs it wrong that security was guarding the Saudi Arabian embassy? Maybe if it were a tank, or a S.W.A.T. team, but one guy!!  Come on Michael!!\n\nDocumentaries in their truest form are UNBIASED and tell us stories with CAMERA, not with VOICE OVER. Moore took his video and talked over it, inputting his own biased democratic opinion.\n\nBush meeting with Al Queda before 9.11 is called a President's job. Presidents meet with all leaders and heads of states at various times for various reasons. Clinton had many cordial visits with Yassar Arafat, does that make him a member of Hamas?\n\nEver heard the phrase: ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer""?\n\nMichael Moore took stock video of Bush and others in these meeting and subjectively inserted his own words.\n\nThe best moments of the movie were when he let the camera speak for itself. Like when the politician admitted that they never read entire bills before passing them, or when he asked politicians about enlisting their sons. That's documentary film making!  Unfortunately, most of Fahrenheit 9.11 is Michael Moore voice over propaganda.\n\nA true documentary would have also told the story of the Priest and his congregation that went to Iraq to protest before everything happened. When he got there, he was faced with an onslaught of Iraqi's who told him gruesome stories of the things that Saddam had done to the people of Iraq, and they wanted to know when we were coming to remove him. He promptly returned to the U.S. with a publicly changed mind.\n\nMoore proved something though. The power of film is great. You can show images and voice over nearly an entire film with your opinions and many many people will believe everything you say.\n\nIn my opinion, treat 9.11 like today's biased network newscasts. Make sure you know which network your watching and don't believe everything you hear.\n\nIf you truly want to get a view of the FACTS behind Fahrenheit 9.11, watch it, but also watch FahrenHYPE 9.11. Another documentary that shows how much of Michael Moore's speel was based on lies and baseless information.\n\nFinally, if any democrats came out of watching Fahrenheit 9.11 and thought that members of their own party were immune to the same shifty government practices and BIG MONEY favoritism, think again!  Both parties are guilty of these things and if you think otherwise... YOU'RE A FOOL.\n\nI was sort of a fan of Michael Moore before 9.11. But, after watching this, I have lost all respect for him. He has ABUSED his power, disgraced our military and has at numerous times in this film, lied about things to suit his agenda, or maybe JUST DIDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK, and that to me is irresponsible and unforgiveable.\n\nMoore should be excited about one thing though, apparently Osama Bin Laden has now seen his movie... and has given it two thumbs up.";Documentary with VOICE OVER bias and KEEN EDITING

We invaded Afghanistan so we can build a pipeline. Well, we have been in there three years now and NO PIPELINE is being built. The truth is two company's back in the mid 90s considered building a pipeline in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration even helped one of the company's by talking with the Taliban about it. But it never came off. if was considered unfeasible and not worth it. So its a lie by Mr. Moore.

Since Michael sees so much wrong with our country, his film topics will be endless. Michael's persona fills up each frame in this latest street-guerilla-with-a-film-crew documentary. Unlike his other films, Michael allows a young man dressed up as a Marine to share center stage with him. He parades this slim deer-in-the-headlights looking actor around ambushing and then confronting Republican officials, who often have a similarly vacant gaze. He never assaults John Edwards or John Kerry for their support of the Afghani and Iraqi wars.\n\nIf you are a Republican, this film will not change you mind on how to vote. So, Republicans, don't waste your money. If you are a Democrat, Michael's film is designed to deepen your hatred for the administration of George II. So, Democrats, waste your money and go see this film...George II's tax cuts will ensure that Michael Moore has more of your money to take home or take to the nearest pizzeria.

1262;136.0;5.0;33.0;I've seen this twice now, and found it a swell piece of propaganda, a fine counterbalance to the excrement that for years has been spewing from Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and their ilk. Nice to see the Left finally growing some cajones. Now I can't wait for THE CORPORATION and OUTFOXED. . .Having read most of the anti-Moore diatribes in this review section, I'm starting to believe that the idea of making an intelligence (or at least a literacy) test mandatory before voting might not be such a bad one after all. At least it would forever spare us the likes of George W. Bush.;ANOTHER FIVE-STAR REVIEW
1271;137.0;1.0;33.0;"Let's address some of the deceit and malice in this movie: First off, Moore repeats the tired liberal canard that Bush stole the 2000 election. Come on now, we all know Gore and the Dems tried to flout electoral law to continue the recounts long after this was permitted. And even an independent recount by the AP, Tribune Media and other press months after the election proved that Bush still got more votes in Florida than Gore did. Right-thinking people know unscrupulous Dems hoped to steal that election through so-called ""recounts"" as well as disenfranchising military voters, which were more likely to be Republican.\nMoore tries to make President Bush and his staff look bad or just silly over and over in this crockumentary. It would be very easy to follow Kerry and Edwards on their campaign trail and get similar footage, should some conservatives be so inclined to gather unused footage from the media and do some sneak filming of their own. But that would just be childish. Moore makes a big deal out of Bush's so-called lack of immediate response to the WTC attacks while in that classroom, ridiculing him for his silence and continuing to read to the elementary school kids. What would Moore have liked Bush to do - declare war on someone immediately, perhaps bomb the Saudis? Bush is merely displaying the human reaction: the shock and numbness many of us felt watching those planes hit the towers. I admire President Bush - he displays the calm of a man in trying times, mourning the loss of lives and speaking with peace and gentleness to innocent little children.\nMoore ridicules Bush for issuing a warning to terrorists in between a game of golf. What Moore does not reveal is how this was not a sign of laxity prior to 9/11 or a casual response to 9/11, but rather a response when Bush was asked about the continued terror attacks against Israel! Tricky editing by Moore to get the reaction he desires.\nMoore faults the marine recruiters for sticking to lower-income areas. Hey, this is reality, folks. The army, navy, marines, etc, know where the most likely recruits come from. The armed forces provide many people with jobs, scholarships and opportunities to study they might not otherwise have. Moore would have something to talk about if this was CONSCRIPTION - if the marines were conscripting ONLY lower income people and minorities. But the US has PROFESSIONAL armed forces - this is a CAREER for the people who sign up. Some people seem to naively believe that soldiers will not have to see armed conflict, like the deserters who said they didn't know they would have to kill people. If you don't want to take the chance you might have to kill someone one day, DON'T sign up for the military! I am thankful for our soldiers who make this hard choice to be soldiers and who are proud to be soldiers. In any event, Moore misrepresents the armed forces as being made up of minorities in disproportionate numbers. This is simply not true. The demographic make-up of the armed forces represents real America; therefore most soldiers are actually white. Surprised?\nMoore tries to use images of wounded soldiers and Iraqi civilians to make people become anti-war. This is just fuel for the crowd that is already anti-war. Such images will always be hard to look at, but we know there is a war on and these are the casualties, it does not make this war less just or diminish our resolve that justice will prevail. Moore and other media weren't around to capture on film the horrors Saddam perpetrated on his people, and he didn't even bother to speak to Iraqis with stories to tell of how they suffered under Saddam and Moore didn't bother to use footage of the mass graves uncovered by US soldiers.\nAt other times Moore uses footage of young troops that attempts to paint American soldiers as casual killers. He makes no attempt to display the courage in battle and compassion to the Iraqi people most of these soldiers have shown. Same with the images from Abu Ghraib prison. They were repeatedly shown and talked about by the media in an effort to portray ALL our soldiers as being heartless barbarians and as though this was official policy. And yet, scant attention was paid to the beheadings perpetrated by the Islamic militants. The difference between American outrage and outrage in the Islamic world is that the soldiers guilty of torture at Abu Ghraib will be punished, but there is hardly a peep about the MURDER of captives at the hands of the Islamic militants.\nThere is more tricky editing Moore does for the best manipulation. Moore actually only met and filmed Lila Lipscomb AFTER her son was already killed. The ""transformation"" you saw take place in her political attitude was carefully edited to appear the loss of a son changed her view on the war. It actually took place months after she first heard the news of her son's death. I don't know Mrs. Lipscomb's mind, but I can fathom grieving mothers being devastated by the loss of their children to war. Many, many mothers lost their sons who were fighting Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, but they didn't suddenly suggest the war wasn't worth it. Likewise, Moore COULD have interviewed parents who have lost children in Iraq but still feel the cause is just. Moore does not do this because it does not help HIS cause.\nI'm glad Fox News and other sources revealed how Moore carefully edited his encounters with members of Congress, when he tried to get them to sign up their kids to serve in Iraq. When one congressman said he in fact had several family members serving in Iraq, Moore deftly left that part on the cutting room floor, as well as his jibe, to get the desired walk-away effect that he retained.\n(...)";The most contemptible film ever made?

And those who support Bush will either avoid it, or hate it.\n\nI hate the job Bush has done as president, but I still think Moore is unfair. His mockumentaries are all alike in one way: they're dishonest. M. Moore doctors, edits, and copy and pastes footage to have people saying things they didn't say, and doing things they didn't do. He makes absurd leaps in logic, and makes connections where there are none. Moore and his kind want the President to be a bumbling idiot, but at the same time, want him to be a diabolical genius capable of orchestrating 9/11, which in itself is as treasonous an accusation as there could be. It's treasonous because these people aren't just raising questions, they're making declarations.\n\nThe scary part about Moore's crockumentaries is the fact that everybody will watch them and believe them despite their blatant dishonesty. People assume that documentaries are supposed to be ethical and truthful. And they ARE supposed to be; which is why Michael Moore's can't be qualified as such.\n\nThe interesting thing is, if Moore really believed what he stood for was the truth, he wouldn't need to lie and distort to prove his argument.\n\nWhether its Roger and Me, Bowling for Columbine, or 9/11--he's never been fair to his topic.

I believe this movie to be an important one, no matter what side of the fence you stand on, just because it is forcing the American public to take a long, hard look at some issues that people do not necessarily want to face.  One thing a documentary should do is make you think about things, and investigate the issues for yourself.  Whether Mr. Moore is lying or not, if he presents ""facts"", and someone disagrees, they should go out and do research to refute the ""facts"", not just rant and rave about how BAD the movie is!  You have to give kudos to Michael Moore for getting out there and putting the issues in our face.  Whether or not you buy into what he is saying, this movie is quite interesting and worth the money.

706;146.0;5.0;32.0;"Some love Michael Moore; others hate him. Hopefully we can all agree on at least this much: because America allows freedom of speech Michael Moore was able to make this film and find help getting it to the public.\n\nAs we know, in Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore decries what he considers to be Bush's lack of initiative to prevent terrorism before the fateful September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our nation. He then proceeds to demonstrate that the Bush family had long standing business ties with the Saudis. He cites sources (including, of course, Richard Clarke) to demonstrate that the Bush administration intended to attack Iraq from almost the first day they took the White House. All in all, this film is Moore's scathing attack on the Bush administration and the Republican party for what he sees as their lack of true concern for the welfare of the American people, putting their personal business interests above everything else. Moore also attacks Cheney for his connections to the Saudis through Halliburton as well.\n\nI admire Moore for his bravery in taking on the powerful Bush family. Freedom of speech allows this and Moore had the right to make this film just as anyone has the right to speak their mind in our nation.\n\nThere are times in this film when Bush does look inept, as when he takes seven minutes to have any response to the news from his chief of staff that the second of the two twin towers in NYC had been hit by a plane. Moore takes great pains to interview soldiers in Iraq and he succeeded to getting them to truly open up about their feelings both pro and con against the war. It was especially refreshing to hear the candid mixed feelings soldiers had about the Iraq war since our news media typically does not cover that angle of this story. I personally felt broken hearted for Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a son killed in Iraq. Moore succeeds in bringing an emotional element to this film both through the soldier interviews and the interviews with Lipscomb. It makes one wonder about the necessity of this war, especially in light of the fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq. (Indeed, on this afternoon's CNN.com web site there is a major story as I write this that ""top U.S. arms inspector reported Wednesday that he found no evidence that Iraq produced any weapons of mass destruction after 1991."") One thing was absent, however: never once was it mentioned that Clinton also ignored terrorist warnings for a long time--it wasn't just Bush!\n\nThe DVD comes with a slew of extras that are also very captivating and interesting to watch. One extra was filmed outside the now infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq the day they released 100 prisoners. I was disturbed at the prison abuse they received. Perhaps American soldiers over there have to be extremely careful and protect themselves by rounding up potential resistance people; but prisoner abuse is not the American way and it brings us down. We also see Condoleezza Rice's 9/11 Commission testimony as well as Bush saying not much after a ""conversation"" with the 9/11 Commission. There is a troubling look at the inadequate security patrol of the coast of Florida as well as the lack of protection in Oregon state.\n\nI recommend that people see this film if they can. The DVD and extras are thought provoking. If you agree with Michael Moore, then it will make you feel great that he got his message across. If you disagree with Moore, see the film anyway--a thorough understanding of his stance will help you think and sharpen your opinions and beliefs to the contrary. Moore has indeed made a significant contribution to the very hot issues of the Iraq war and politics as it relates to big money and big business. SEE IT!";Agree or not, Michael Moore exercises his freedom of speech!
720;147.0;5.0;32.0;"If there was one film this year that was more maligned than ""The Passion of the Christ"", it is ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". You either love Michael Moore's work or you don't. I think it is safe enough to say that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" polarized both the liberals and conservatives. If anything learned from the controversy over ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", there are three conversation topics that makes people's blood boil it has to be: 1) abortion, 2) religion, and 3) politics. Michael Moore's political film really succeeded in pissing off a lot of people. I first saw ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when it first opened in the summer. I loved it. I thought it was far more entertaining than ""Bowling For Columbine"" (although I do love that film). I think it is funny that people think this film is propaganda. Maybe it is but I honestly don't care, I found the film both hilarious and engaging. I had my opinions on the current political climate long before ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". This movie didn't change anything for me. My biggest gripe about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that Michael Moore makes too many innuendos (not that they weren't hilarious which they were)about the current administration therefore sounded like a thirteen year old taunting another kid on the playground instead of an adult, very childish, if not immature at times. Still I couldn't help but laugh at his innuendos. When the film shifted into a more serious tone with the war in Iraq and Lila Lipscomb, I thought that is the film's strength. Michael let the soldiers and Lila tell their side of the story. Watching ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" reminded me how powerful this film was, especially when the film opened up with just the sounds of people running away from the World Trade Towers on 9/11. My favorite moment in the film has to be when Michael Moore borrows an ice cream truck and drives around Capital Hill reading out loud the Patriot Act because the senators and congressmen (allegedly) never bothered reading the Patriot Act. That really floored me. I also thought it was rather prophetic of Michael to try to enlist the children of various politicians who have all voted for the war in Iraq. The dvd bonus features were just as compelling. I especially was interested in what the Arab-American comedians had to say, particularly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I also enjoyed watching the footage where the producer and camera crew went to before and (allegedly) after the war in Iraq. Overall I loved ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and I refuse to apologize for the fact that I love this film. Did it really change my opinions on the current political climate? No but I was thoroughly entertained.";Provocative and entertaining

When you can prove a point by showing George Bush actually saying it with his own words, then it paints a clear picture of his intent.

I'm sorry, is that so wrong? An Anti-Bush agenda? That's wrong? Oh! Of course! Of course it's wrong! We're supposed to eat everything that's fed to us by the media and government, right right. I keep forgetting. In the shadow of September 11th we're supposed to hang little American flags out of our car windows and support the President no matter what. Even when he uses the worst terrorist attack on America as an excuse to attack a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks purely just to profit from oil. From this tragedy we get an amazing documentary that tells it like it is and people don't like that. The truth hurts and to be shown that the people who run this country are not what they seem is too much to handle apparently, especially for bible thumping war vets who probably still think women shouldn't vote and black people should sit in the back of the bus.

We are breeding terrorists, while swatting flies with the largest conventional weapons possible (see Bush's new MOB...""mother of all bombs"" dropped on targets in this war).\n\nAnyway...as far as the movie goes.  Of course Moore has an opinion.  He is a thinking individual.  Not a drone to this administration, which is what most of the 1 star ratings seem to be.

It implies that there were only pathetically small non-US armies involved. With Britain and several smaller countries who do have army, navy and airforce, such as my own, Australia, I think you'll find that Bush did manage to drag together something resembling a coalition to share the blame.\n\nOtherwise it was a very moving film, even to someone who has heard most of the facts before. Seeing the families involved in the army speaking made me realise what it is sometimes easy to forget when you live outside of the US - most Americans aren't morons, some just seem to be being misled by all the Newspeak.;Moore is anti-Bush, not anti-American
182;153.0;1.0;30.0;"Credibility.  That's the watchword for a documentary filmmaker, even one as publically visible as Michael Moore.  Yes, we all know the guy's political agenda, we all know he hates George W. Bush like summer hates the winter, but if Moore is to be taken seriously he has to establish objective credibility that is compelling and believable and not agenda-driven.  Plus, a ""documentary"" is supposed to present BOTH sides of a controversial issue, so that the viewer may make up his or her mind.  Not so with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, which I had predisposed myself to be a muck of warbling nonsense prior to viewing, yet even I could not comprehend its blatant hatred and vitriol.  In the wake of the deadliest attack on U.S. soil I was shocked, concerned, and disturbed that Mr. Moore would decide to kick a political football of diviseness. . .plus put one or two bucks in his pocket, just for jollies.\n\nDon't get me wrong:  George W. Bush is the worst President to reside in the Oval Office since Warren G. Harding (and that's saying something).  I am NOT some politically expedient apologist who enjoys hammering leftists for the sake of hammering; I just call 'em as I see 'em, and Moore dropped a stink bomb here.  Yet, I think I know something about journalism, as I graduated with a degree in it, and I can tell those of you reading these words that Moore has systematically and enthusiastically raped all tenets of objective and unbiased reporting that those of us who labored under the guise of reporting strove mightily to obey.  This piece of sludge isn't a documentary; it's a piece of disingenous propaganda that usurps common decency.  This is flagrant. . .flagrant. . .sensationalism; the very fact Moore tries to paint a Bush/bin Laden connection without flushing out ALL the facts reeks of moral corruption and ineptitude even more telling than Moore's bashing of Shrub.\n\n(And by the way, Michael:  You aren't that funny, either.)\n\nBut heck:  If someone wants to show me that the devastating attacks of 9/11 were the by-products of a corrupt administration in bed with oil-producing countries in the Middle East--a corruption intent on ""looking the other way"" to protect its billionaire buddies--well, I'm all ears.  Show me the money.  But Michael Moore can't:  He's too busy spinning his hatred and personal vendetta against George W. Bush.  The whole ""film"" comes across as contrived and constipated; yeah, Mr. Moore, we get the fact Bush Jr. ran several companies into the ground (What the heck is your point?).

538;163.0;1.0;30.0;"Do your research! Do not confuse Moore's attempt to make money with an attempt to unearth the truth. This ""documentary"" does not live up to its title. Rather than being based on fact this victional spun film only supports the hatred that many Americans hold onto so tightly they'd lie about anything to get you to join in their hatred. I urge you- I challenge you to investigate for yourself the false guise of Michael Moore's so called ""documentary.""";A WOLF IS A WOLF & A LIE IS A LIE... ITS THAT SIMPLE
546;164.0;1.0;30.0;"Moore's film makes some great jokes and touches the heart in many areas.  The problem is that he relies on these methods to make his point and not on careful analysis of evidence and well-constructed arguments.  He frequently takes Bush's words out of context, and not only those, but also the words of the other people whose interviews appeared in his movie.  Out of a wide variety of evidence, he selects the pieces of evidence that fit his point of view and presents only those.  A good example of this would be the frequent appeal to personal testimony to undergird his arguments, picking only the stories of those people who would agree with him anyway, without giving anyone with a different point of view any time to speak at all.  The voices of people who disagree with Bush's policies are given far more time in the movie than Bush's own words, which is a problem when one considers the fact that this is a movie about Bush.  We rarely see clips of Bush speaking more than a few words at a time, much less complete paragraphs; how are we supposed to understand what Bush is saying in each instance without understanding the context in which Bush originally spoke?  Instead of that context, Moore provides his own context and covers up his lack of scholarship with hilarious jokes and attacks on Bush's character.  Emotive appeals and ad hominem attacks like these are quite effective in convincing people to believe what you say, even if you have very little evidence for what you are saying.\n\nIf you still aren't convinced, put yourself in the shoes of someone who wants to make a propaganda film supporting Bush.  Take Bush's opponents' words out of context and re-contextualize those words in funny and catchy ways to make THEM look like they have poor character.  Interview hundreds of people and then include only the interviews of the people who agree strongly with your point of view.  Make sure, at the end, that you have video clips of Saddam's soldiers committing horrible atrocities and laughing over their own crimes as if it's all a big joke.  (Be sure not to include the behavior of any soldiers who actually seem to conduct themselves in a moral way.)\n\nI'll buy this movie because I think it's important for my middle school students to understand the methods used in propaganda, hopefully so they can avoid them rather than practicing them.  And in the end, it does have the redeeming quality of being absolutely hilarious.";Moore could benefit from a class in logic
557;165.0;5.0;30.0;You know, I'm so sick and tired of conservatives crying about their man Bush. Did liberals cry when Clinton was raked over the coals? No. The truth is that Michael Moore is a brilliant filmmaker. Sure, he has a bias. If he didn't, you'd call him a spineless bimbo. I'm glad that liberals like he and Bill Maher are around. It seems to me that when intelligent, opinionated liberals are about, conservatives can't take it.\n\nNow, with that being said, what is so difficult to believe about facts in this movie? I have read most of the reviews here and have yet to see anyone say exactly what Michael Moore is lying about in his movie. Even Condi Rice, when asked, couldn't provide proof of what Moore lied about in his film.\n\nLet me pose this question: Is it really that difficult to believe that the President would NOT declare war on a man who he was in bed with financially? (although this man flew two planes into our buildings -- perhaps over said financial dealings, who knows?). Let's get it straight, people. When somenone punches you in the face, do you punch him back or the guy next to him? I haven't seen anything about us getting close to catching Bin-Laden, but we sure as hell have Saddam. When you think about it all together, it's really simple.\n\nI think the conservatives who have reviewed this film are so caught up in the way Moore tells his story (very tongue-in-cheek) that they are consumed by rage and immediately ready to dismiss the film as lies.;Moore = Genius
583;166.0;5.0;30.0;"First and foremost I applaud Michael Moore. Essentially what is in this film is what is in his book, ""Dude, Where's My Country?""

Thus he created a more ""user friendly"" version which Farenheit 9/11.\n\nThis movie is an eye-opener. To the average american who maybe doesn't get NPR or has access to the internet or no CSPAN or cable for that matter, they only get your basic 3 major networks. Their news and in fact MOST American Media is biased. My friends sister asked, when we were watching the film, ""where did moore get all this information?"" Well I said, some of it he did himself I'm sure but there are other media in the world such as Britain's BBC, Middle Eastern News and others like Australia or Asian news. I'm sure it's out there if one investigates.\n\nSo I bought the DVD. First time ever buying a DVD. I have cable, and if I need to see a movie it's Blockbuster time. But this was more important. I went to work and told everyone I knew if they've seen it and alot said no. So I started a 2 day free rental. Low and behold I have a list until election day. I advised everyone to watch it with freinds and family members especially people who are undecided. And yet there are two people at work that are stout Republicans. I offered because of course they don't want to PAY for moore's ""crap"", to let them see it for free. They adamantly declined.\n\nThe problem with the entire system is RetrovsMetro.org. Read up. People are so blinded by everything that they are not the least bit interested to open their mind to other opinions. I could say more but that would be an entire book. Please watch it and decide for yourself. I would see farenhype 9/11 although the trailer just gives people saying ""it's all a lie"" so we will see. Be objective!";A great help for an undecided voter...

The fact is, everything in this movie can be traced back to cold hard facts, if it couldn't, it would not be allowed to be released as a documentary, and there would be tons of lawsuits against Mr. Moore right now, but there aren't, because you can't disprove anything.  (...)  Did he come up with his own conclusion after reading and assembling the facts?  Of course!  Did G.W.Bush come up with his own conclusion after reading and manupulating the facts on WMD's in Iraq?  Of course.  C'mon, Everybody's doing it.

Some may say this is leftist propaganda and that Michael Moore ""hates America"", but they couldn't be farther from the truth. Michael Moore isn't a democrat or a republican and he works to expose the wrongdoings of BOTH parties (he certainly didn't exclude President Clinton).\n\nMichael Moore loves this country and it clearly shows in all his work. From his first documentary, ""Roger and Me"", that tells the story of GM closing their plant in Flint, Michigan to open factories abroad to ""Bowling for Columbine"", a documentary that explores the culture of fear and violence in our country; He is a purveyor of truth and an advocate for change.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 is no different. Moore doesn't just spew out liberal opinions on the Bush administration and Iraq, he shows you footage and documents that the rest of the news conveniently leave out. A great example of this is the footage of George W. Bush's induction day. Moore shows the huge protests that went on that day in DC - like no other presidential induction ceremony in history.  The media didn't inform us of this. And there are many other examples. The ties between the Bush family and the Saudi Arabians also come as quite a shocker. The footage is there for you to see.\n\nWhether you are democrat, republican, green, or independent - see this movie. Don't let the ""faux"" news channel or a partisan reviewer form your opinions.

Perhaps its because the man who made the doc. is so hated among Bush supporters.  Many of the people who support Dubya just watch this movie to slam it.  If you agree with just watching a movie to hate it, don't bother reading my review.\n\n  MIchael Moore.  What comes to your mind when you hear the name.  Someone who hates America? Someone who hates Bush? That guy that wears the strange clothing?  Well when I hear the name, I think of the good documetaries he has made.  In this particular film, Moore decides to target Bush and the Iraq war.  He interviews mothers whose children have died in the war and congressmen who refuse to send their children to the war.  Do you see what I'm getting at?  Moore tries to show both sides in this movie.  If your unsure about the reall meaning about the war, watch this documetary(or is it a comedy/drama).\n\nWas the bit about the monkeys true? Ha ha;Plays on emotions,obviously, but still watch it.

I don't know what dictionary you use, but if you can't even spell 'Traitor' it shows how ill educated and ignorant some of the people who oppose this film are.\n\nSitting at the bottom right hand corner of the world in cosy Australia, I cannot understand the American people and their fundamental lack of the ability to laugh at themselves. Your humor is generally poor (laughing at others misfortune, terrible catchphrases etc.), you don't understand Monty Python properly (members of Monty Python like Michael Palin are the first to admit this), in fact you're such backward rednecks that you can't even pronounce the word 'Python' (it's pronounced 'Pie-thin', not 'Pie-THON').\n\nYour health system is terrible, your education system is so bad that most of you don't even know where the countries you're bombing are.\n\nMichael Moore is simply pleaing for sanity, he hopes for a time when you elect intelligent people who want to let everyone have the right to a good education, healthcare and not get shot at by loons with assault weopons when they go shopping.

Accept the fact that even though there are brutal dictatorships around the world and there always will be, bombing civilians in these countries will not change this. Sucessful Regime change comes through other means, look at India and South Africa, learn a little from history.\n\nOf coarse all of those who gave this film five stars already know how corrupt and rediculous your political system is.

It is rather obvious that those that say it is trash, have a political agenda and those who praise it to the sky have one too.\n\nThere's no doubt that Moore despises the Bush administration, and he would say he has reason to do so.  Many of the visual representations in the film are biased and distorted.  There are, however, powerful images in the film.  Bush's 7 minutes, The Saudi-Bin Laden connection to the Bush family and the greed exemplified at the fundraiser.  There are also some slanted scenes, such as following a proud Flint housewife whose son goes into the military, and dies, and whose conversion to anti-Bush after the death is predictable.\n\nPersonally I had no problems with Bush until Iraq.  I supported his Patriotic enthusiasm to destroy those that attacked us.  I was all for the Afghanistan invasion.  It was clear that that country had harbored and trained Al Queda and that Bin Laden was there.  Any undertones or connections with Bin Laden by Bush were not evident to me.  Then came Iraq - and the rush to war and my opinions of the Bush administration changed dramatically.\n\nSo, like everyone else, I went to see 9/11 with pre-conceptions.\n\nAs a film, I felt that Fahrenheit 9/11 was a bit long, sometimes predictable (based on Moore's bias) and even often overdone.\n\nI was shocked, to some extent, to see the heated discussions in Congress about the Florida voter count.  I was unaware of that.\n\nBut, this film has lasting images which might aid in turning this election.  There are moments when visual evidence of our President's greed, indecision, and single-mindedness cannot be denied.\n\nI agree that the film is NOT a documentary, it IS propoganda.  But it does show clearly that Bush was determined to get rid of Saddam at all costs, and perhaps, just perhaps, OIL was at the root of invasion of Iraq.  If Moore is correct, what Bush has done will go down in history as a invasion of a sovereign state for no other reason than he personally hated Saddam, though a tyrant and a despot, who was incapable of injuring the USA.  This is something that no other President in the history of this country has ever done.\n\nHowever, if Moore is incorrect, then he has done a disservice to a President that has simply waged a war on terrorists who attacked us without provocation.\n\nWhen you think about it, based upon what we all know now, don't you have to say - NAH?";It's a good film

Not one of the criticisms has included an example.  Okay, so, you think Moore's lying... about what???  Give me one example of a ""lie"" from the documentary.  They can't do it because facts are facts.\nThe criticism that Fahrenheit 9/11 is biased is really funny.  Michael Moore makes no bones about the fact that his political views are an open book.  This is not a news report (which is expected to be balanced).  This is a documentary (which ALWAYS has a point of view).  It doesn't matter whether the subject is about a lake being polluted or whatever, every documentary has a point of view.  Moore lays out a number of separate facts and then shows footage of the Saudis and the Bushes shaking hands.... the criticism is that the footage doesn't relate to the facts presented!  Well, DUH... any idiot can see that that particular footage is all from official state functions.  Unless Michael Moore's research team is comprised of CIA operatives hiding in closets on the Bush ranch, there will never be any footage related to the facts he is presenting!  Moore lays out the facts like dots on paper and we connect them.  That's as close as anyone can ever get to the backroom agendas.\nThose are the only types of criticisms I have heard... nobody has disputed any of his facts because they are just that.... facts.  He is ready for it.  He has a ""war room"" ready to back up any statement that anyone tries to dispute.  And nobody has, so far.  They only try to ""justify"" what we see on screen.  And, there are SO MANY gut-wrenching points in this film that for anyone to be walking away talking about the stupid stuff (as mentioned above)... well, that just boggles my mind.\n\nMost of what I saw I already knew because I do pay attention to alternative media, but there were some things I didn't know.  Anyway, I hear there are some owners of small theater chains who are refusing to show it.  God, that's scary!!!!  While they may have the legal right to deny the film because they are private businesses, it is the film equivalent to book burning.  It sounds like the days of Hitler when you have someone telling you  ""I watched this and I decided you don't need to see it""\nIt's just like voting... if you don't vote, you don't have a right to complain about the person in office.  It doesn't matter whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Libertarian or whatever... open your mind and go see the film for yourself.\nP.S.  I take serious exception to the few who say that Bush's famous 7 minutes of staying in the classroom after the 2nd plane hit is okay because he didn't want to upset the kids.  Get your heads out of your asses!  Simply excusing himself would have been fine.  The second grade teachers were there to deal with the second grade children and tell them ""Mr. President has some important president stuff to do"" or however the teachers (skilled in talking to 7 year olds) chose to explain him simply excusing himself.  Teachers are for talking to the children... presidents are for running the country in times of crisis.\nThen there are those who say the 7 minutes wouldn't have mattered anyway.  Well, gee, hindsight sure is clear!  But, at that actual moment in time when he was told about the second plane, seven minutes is a long, long time.  I know how long it felt because I desperately tried to get in touch with my husband who was at his office one and a half blocks from the Sears Tower.  Three planes were still unaccounted for... all I could picture was the Sears Tower toppling over onto my husband's building (the Sears construction is different and I believe it would topple rather than collapse) - or- a plane being shot down on top of my husband right before striking the Sears building.  This anxiety went on for a couple of hours.  We can all analyze the situation in hindsight.  However, the fact remains that when all of this was taking place, nobody knew what was happening next and YES, every second counted.  I expect a president to stand up, excuse himself (not wait for someone to come in and get him), and TAKE CHARGE of the situation.\nEven after the first plane hit... when Bush was still in the hallway, having been informed of a plane hitting one of the largest buildings in the country, (even if it was an accident) I believe he should have chosen to find out what the hell was going on instead of proceeding to spend time on a photo op.\nAnd, why the hell was Cheney the one giving the orders to shoot down planes when ""the commander in chief"" was readily available?  Now there's some food for thought...\nI believe Moore could have made an 8 hour documentary and still not covered all of the lies and unethical, immoral actions of this administration.\nThere is just SO MUCH.  Everything seems to be ""under investigation"".  Like what came out several months ago during the Richard Clarke discussions.  In November, 2001, when congress approved attacking Afghanistan, why was money ILLEGALLY taken out of that appropriation to start early actions against Iraq?  That's just one of a dozen reasons I believe Bush should be impeached.  They say it's ""under investigation"".  I'd like to know if some of these ""investigations"" will be concluded before the election.\nGod help us all.  And, God, please protect Michael Moore after having stepped on some very rich and powerful toes.\nThanks, Michael... if you have made it through the media censorship to open even one person's eyes to the un-American misuse of power perpetrated by the most powerful Americans... then you have succeeded.";Moore's Critics are Full of Hot Air

By caving into pressure from the right, Disney not only failed to honor Moore's right to free speech, but it also let a blockbuster smash slide through its fingers.  Is Moore an opportunist for deliberately releasing this movie during an election year?  Probably.  Is it biased?  Only a fool would say ""no.""  But regardless of what side of the political fence you're on, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" will arouse fierce debate, and its images will alarm, disturb and unnerve.  Not to mention that the movie is funny as hell.  The opening sequence outlines, with strong conviction, how the 2000 election was manipulated to portray Bush as the winner.  Other interesting clips are a ditzy Britney Spears blindly endorsing the president, evidence that links the Bush family to the bin Ladens, footage of Bush reading nursery rhymes to grade school kids for SEVEN MINUTES after he got word of the 9/11 attacks, as well as Moore vainly trying to persuade congressmen to get their children to enlist in the very Iraq war they endorsed.  But the heart of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" rests in Lila Lipscomb.  Lila is a working class mother in Flint, MI, and is aggressively supportive of the war in Iraq until she learns that her son, a soldier, was killed in battle.  Witnessing her anguish onscreen (and in front of the White House where she vents her frustration and mourns the loss of her son) is truly heartbreaking.  Moore rocked several comfort zones during his infamous 2003 Oscar speech for his previous documentary ""Bowling for Columbine,"" and ""Fahrenheit"" will no doubt do more of the same.  Good for him.

Whether or not you agree with his arguments in Fahrenheit 9/11 - and there's a lot to debate.\nBut the Michael Moore of Roger & Me was a modest man who seemed genuinely interested in getting at the truth, along with afflicting the smug and comfortable with good humour. The Michael Moore of Fahrenheit 9/11 seems petty and vindictive, bent on not only taking down the people he disagrees with, but also humiliating them for the sheer screw-you sport of it.\nMoore makes some valid points in the movie about the Bush Administration's handling of the terrorism file before and after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He asks questions - not new, but still requiring answers - about relations between the Bush family and Saudi oil interests, including the family of 9/11 terrorist Osama bin Laden. He asks, as many people do, why members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. shortly after 9/11, despite the grounding of all aircraft in the wake of the terror attacks.\nHe thunders righteously, mainly through emotional interviews with bereaved relatives and disgruntled servicemen, about the justification for the Iraq War, which Bush and his cronies started under false pretences and continue to engage in for increasingly elusive and dubious goals.\nBut Moore also can't seem to keep from playing the schoolyard bully. Much has been made of the found footage in Fahrenheit 9/11 that shows a stressed-out Bush inside a Florida kindergarten classroom the morning of Sept. 11, thinking for seven long minutes about how to react to an aide's whispered news that a second jet has struck the World Trade Center, and a terrorist war on America is underway.\nMoore also shows, repeatedly, candid views of Bush and his colleagues being made up for TV shows, as if there's something sinister about them doing exactly what politicians of every stripe - not to mention filmmakers, journalists and everyone else - do prior to making formal television appearances.\nHe seems to want to have it both ways about everything. He paints Bush to be the dumbest U.S. president ever, but also as a diabolical schemer who stole an election and conned his countrymen into an immoral war. He claims Bush underreacted to terrorism before 9/11 (he quotes a dubious statistic that Bush was on vacation for 42 per cent of his first year in office), who then overreacted to terror after 9/11.\nIn my opinion, the film was nothing more than propaganda. Probably his worst film ever.................;From satirist to propagandist

He called me and every other American stupid, now honestly, how can you follow this guy? And when will Amazon make 0 stars an option?

Also, Mooreon said that he hoped more Americans would die in Iraq so Bush wouldn't be reelected, he called the insurgents the true patriots in Iraq and said they were going to win, and called Zarqawi, the terrorist responsible for beheading civilians, a ""minuteman."" Statements like this during wartime are nothing short of sedition. Now this socialist fatass is making a sequel to this movie.

529;190.0;4.0;29.0;"First off, I am amazed by the one-star reviewers on this forum who spend their one or two paragraphs' worth of commentary on Michael Moore's character rather than on his FILM (which is supposed to be the subject of these reviews). One, this is oddly typical of right-wingers to indulge in character assaults when they can't form coherent arguments to back what they support; and two, this is telling in that most of said one-star reviewers probably haven't even bothered to see the film.\n\nI have to admit, I am not a huge Michael Moore fan and was initially reluctant to see his most recent movie. I had viewed him as somewhat of a blowhard, albeit a mostly well-intentioned one--a Rush Limbaugh of the left, as is oft his comparison. I was already against the war in Iraq even before the first boots hit the ground there, so I felt that his movie was ""preaching to the choir"" when my husband and I went to see it for the first time, and didn't feel Moore's movie would offer anything I didn't already know or think for myself.\n\nAfter having seen it (and afterwards buying the DVD), I am glad to admit that I'd judged this movie--and Moore--quite wrongly. Fahrenheit 9/11 not only takes a compassionate view of the 9/11 victims and families, but also of the soldiers going to fight a war that a lot of us Stateside, and all over the world, didn't want. By taking the focus off of himself--which is thankful, given that he can ""grandstand"" a lot by pulling some really cute ice-cream truck prankery that doesn't do a whole lot of good)--he's able to send home a lot of compelling messages about the rife corruption in the Bush administration and how it is tearing not only the Iraqi people, but our own people, apart.\n\nAlthough I didn't previously dispute the wrong reasons for going to war in Iraq that Moore brings up, I was really surprised (and frankly sickened) to learn about how deeply our administration (and the Bush family) is entrenched in the oil biz and the Saudi government--which is arguably equally as oppressive as the Taliban, especially in its treatment of women. The right-wingers' hair-splitting of how Moore ""twists the facts"" is lost here; he has clearly done some great research and backs up his claims with interviews and official documents that underscore the coverups and corruption in the Bush administration.\n\nThus, most of what Moore presents in this movie is believable and credible; it blows my mind that many on the right can dispute the perspectives of military officials' interviews, documents, and film strips of the President himself in action--or inaction, is more like it. The most compelling of these perspectives is that of Lila Lipscomb, an admitted conservative Democrat who supports the military fervently, but mourns her son's death in a war that was not necessary.\n\nAll of this being said, the movie is not without its problems or flaws. I already mentioned the ice-cream truck shenanigans--typical Moore of anyone who's ever caught his cable show--and also his portrayal of the pre-war Iraq being an almost Western-like fairyland in which everyone was happy and complicit under Saddam's totalitarian regime.\n\nThis latter portrayal is disingenuous; but it underlines the point that replacing one totalitarian regime with another, especially under the false pretense of ""democracy"", is wrong--and this is the crux of what I think Michael Moore is trying to say. I really came out of the theatre after watching this movie with a renewed respect for Moore and his filmmaking. He has a big heart and a profound message, and this movie is definitely worth seeing.";Has its problems, but overall is a worthwhile watch
593;191.0;5.0;29.0;This is the most controversial film of the year. To the media and public memory its worse than The Passion of the Christ. The movie has images and files not seen on the news with humor and sarcastic points. But this is Moore's most serious film where he knows that the facts mean more than the candid apperances. You can hate Bush or love Bush but hating this film without ever seeing it makes you a hyprocrite. Whether you are Democratic or Republican or in between go see this movie. This is the best thing to independent media.\n\nHere are some points on the film and American society:\n1. If you don't believe Moore's claims then go to his website (...) with factual back up\n2. It's not anti american to question the president. Thats what Moore did and our founding fathers did in 1776.\n3. Why do people only question Moore than these other books and films? Is it because he has personality?\n4. Remember that Saddam did not attack us, Bin Laden did and he is NOT in Iraq.\n5.

If the worst thing you can say about a movie is that the filmmaker is overweight, I guess it can't be all that bad.

879;195.0;5.0;29.0;"I will break from my usual tradition of talking entirely too much about things that deeply affect me in the political realm and say quite simply that a refusal to see this movie by Michael Moore is synonymous with a refusal to actually be an American in the spirit of the founding fathers.\n\nMoore knew early on in his career that he would have to develop a marketable persona and larger (and more annoying) than life personality, such that the underlying messages of hope and faith in actual democracy inherent in his films would get out--along with the truth about the deadly direction some in America would like to take it. Like any skilled doctor needing to share a real diagnosis that no one wants to hear, he knew early on--from the days of ROGER AND ME--that the architects of the free market system that is slowly destroying democracy in America had far too much power over the media and interrelated institutions for his message to truly be heard any other way. This now near-iconic celebrity persona of his is what people of opposing viewpoints often debate about--forgetting, if actually ever knowing, that it is manufactured for one specifically noble purpose: get the truth OUT; out of the stale, impotent, universities; off the shelves of the dissident bookstores; out of the hands of the corpoarate leaders who know it will save lives and whole cultures but adversely affect their bottom line. In other words, getting the truth out of the hands of the spineless, useless and moral-less, and into the hands of everyday regular people, without whom the world would not even exist, let alone come to an end.\n\nIn other words, do not make the mistake the marketplace has been hoping you'd make of confusing the messenger with the message. I saw this movie in the theatres with my teenage children months ago and it is still affecting my entire family. Hardcore Republican friends of mine who were also in the theatre were more dumbstruck and silent than I was.\n\nIf there has ever been a little voice in your head that has questioned the inconsistencies of the very concept of terrorism as it has been defined by our current politicians; wondered why the search for Osama bin Laden and the war in Afghanistan--a country full of almost nothing but oil trade routes and the poorest people on earth--has somehow fallen off the radar screen with the (pre-planned) rise of Iraq; wondered if the manufactured image of our political leaders is what is actually guiding your support or refutation of their influence above and beyond their actual records of ""service""--and to what they have  actually been serving...if there is any part of your soul still clinging to life in this soul killing quasi-fascist state our beloved country seems to be falling toward, you will find a CPR for the mind, body and soul the likes of which you never experienced before in life with this movie.\n\nMichael Moore and FARENHEIT 9-11 have had a multitude of detractors for some time now. But I have yet to hear anyone, literally anyone, refer to the actual facts consistently proven and re-proven when they condemn him. Facts that have been purposely and consistently ignored by the corporate media in the evening news and daily papers--even in the context of their reviews of the movie, its unprecedented success as a documentary, or irrational personal attacks against him. Even the most intelligent and patriotic people on the opposite side of the fence revert to screaming children when critiquing this movie, totally ignoring the movie as a whole, or the most vivid and damaging of the facts within.\n\nThe facts that make up this powerful and frightening documentary are too disturbing to be taken lightly. And yet the courage and artistry it takes to actually present these facts in an entertaining and informative way as Moore does is nothing short of astounding.\n\nAgree with it. Disagree with it. Call him names. Praise his name. Love him. Hate him. Just forget what you think about Michael Moore the person and see this movie, if you have ever once said you love this country. This movie is an absolute masterpiece--and undoubtedly the most important movie of any kind made in the past twenty years.

This film is not an account of what happened on that terrible day in history, but the shock waves it made, which today still can be felt. If you have read either Dude Wheres My Country or Stupid White Men you would have felt like you have seen this film, as it is just both books made into a film really. The film starts with the 2000 elections in the apparent 'Most Democratic Country in the World' where Bush lost the vote but still became president. The moment where citizens of Florida ask for it to be put right but cannot get a single signature from the Senate, just filled me with anger, how can the people of america allowed Bush to wim, it disgusts me still.\n\nThe rest of the film is really what a job Bush has done, making America the least respected country in the world.

Moments of the film are alos heart breaking, like the mothor of a child who was killed in Iraq over a qar over oil.\n\nOverall I thought this was an excellent film, better then  Bowling for Columbine.

The middle deals with Bush's incompetence and the manipulation of 9/11 to scare the public.

1422;201.0;5.0;29.0;"A film by Michael Moore\nMichael Moore has stated from the start what ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is and what it is intended to be.  The film is an attack on President Bush about his handling of our country and his actions after September 11, 2001.  The film is an indictment for his entire presidency and President Bush's failure to truly ""lead"" our nation.  Michael Moore has had no hidden agenda.  His agenda with this film has been quite public.  He wants to educate the public about President Bush and he wants President Bush out of office.  Moore is using this documentary as a platform against President Bush and he is open about it.  All documentaries, whether or not the director is open about it, have a certain amount of bias.  I'm not sure it is possible to not show bias and still have a quality film that makes a point.  Moore is just less subtle about his bias than most.\nSince this is a documentary, there are three things that must be taken into consideration:\n 1. Is this a well made, quality piece of filmmaking?\n 2. Is this movie entertaining?\n 3. Is the documentary factual?\nThe first two questions are common to all movies.  The third question is directed towards a documentary.  I do not have the expertise to answer question 3, but I can say that many of the arguments Moore makes in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" are ones that I have heard before, often from reputable sources, so I am inclined to accept the veracity of the facts presented in this movie.  The facts may be accurate, but is Moore's interpretation truthful?\nMichael Moore opens ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with the 2000 election and the claims that George W Bush, with the help of his brother and the official vote counter of Florida, cheated to win the election.  Moore goes onto show the viewer how Bush always intended to invade Iraq, even before September 11, even if there was no connection between Iraq and the particular terrorists who were to blame.  Moore continues to show the connection between Bush's family and the Bin Ladin family (which is not the same thing as a connection directly with Osama) and how numerous members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States without being questioned only two days after the 9/11 attacks.  It is Moore's contention that President Bush has been a failure as President, but worse, has been damaging to our country and to the world.\nRight now I have no reason to doubt the facts presented in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", but it is Moore's interpretation of the facts that point to a larger conspiracy among everyone in the administration to fight the war in Iraq no matter the provocation (or a lack thereof).  It is Moore's interpretation that says that President Bush deliberately manipulated America with the fear of post 9/11 that has allowed him to fight a war that nobody would have supported otherwise.  I'll admit that Moore makes a compelling and powerful case, but I'm not sure how much I am yet willing to accept all of his interpretations.\nOne thing is clear to me, however.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a skillfully made political film that far surpasses any of the political advertisements that you see on television that are ""approved"" by the candidate.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is deeply moving, often funny, and is a well made, well crafted film.  It goes without saying that this is a very divisive film and perhaps the viewer's enjoyment of it (or even acceptance of it) may very well depend on what side of the political spectrum one finds himself (or herself).

How do the families of these young men and women feel about the war and having their children shipped out to fight?

603;211.0;5.0;28.0;I have enjoyed Michael Moore's work in the past - Bowling for Columbine was particularly brilliant.  His most recent film was educational to me - I hadn't realized it was the President's cousin at Fox News who originally called Florida for Bush in 2000.  No matter what your political perspective, this is a fascinating film.  I highly recommend it!;A brilliant documentary
709;212.0;5.0;28.0;Michael Moore is partisan.  He has never stated otherwise.  He is honest and truly wants to see all Americans do well.  This documentary is moving, interesting and give you insight into the things that the Republicans are really doing.  The Republicans have many average everyday people fooled into thinking they are with them and for them ... They are not!  They cater to the wealthy and the elite.  Michael Moore sees this and about half of the country sees this.  I would recommend Michael Moore's books and documentaries to anyone ... but don't just accept his info.  Read other information and get a well rounded view of what is happening in this country at the hands of the Republicans and how they are wreaking havoc all over the world for selfish gains ... not for the American people.  Farenheit 9/11 is a great documentary and should make anyone with half an ounce of a brain think!;* Well Done *

They never seemed to back up their\n\nthreats themselves, but almost always had others do it for\n\nthem. And maybe you got tired of it, and decided,  since\n\nthis is my high school too, though I don't have wealthy\n\nparents, and am not the captain of the football team, I'll\n\ntell someone. I will rat them out. But, no. Too scared.\n\nYou think maybe being a non entity is a good deal. I after\n\nall am not bullying anyone, or  lying about people. I'm not\n\ncheating on my exams. It will come back to haunt the\n\nbullies. Because you believe in justice You hear about\n\nthings being for a reason. You hear that if you are good\n\nand don't curse or drink or smoke, or hurt other people,\n\nyou're OK.\n\nBut the bullies drink and smoke. And think nothing about\n\nhurting other people. They kind of enjoy it.  Some of them\n\ndrink and smoke a lot. You think it's so transparent. I see\n\nthe results of their bullying and getting away with it.\n\nWhere is the justice?\n\nAnd you think: If I  was mean enough, or if only I had a\n\nrich daddy. If only I didn't have to study hard or at all,\n\nand teachers still passed me to the next grade? So you go\n\nhome at night and you study three or four hours, then you\n\ncontinue reading a book before school interrupted you\n\nfrom real books and learning real stuff. Books like\n\n""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" ""Brave\n\nNew World,"" or ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" And\n\nyou maybe want to talk about them in English lit. class\n\nbecause you've grown tired of the sanitized stuff in the\n\ntext book. But you know your thoughts are suspect.\n\nWhen did this happen? As you discover there are an awful\n\nlot of bullies around. And they aren't all in school. And\n\nthey are not terribly bright. You just know they will make\n\nit in the world. You just know they will get away with\n\nanything.\n\nYou read later Bertrand Russell's definition of how\n\nschools make ""manly men"" and how those ""manly men""\n\ndie on battlefields, not knowing why, and it all has to do\n\nwith school, and learning to play the game and not earn\n\nthe enmity of ""fools."" And maybe some of these ""manly\n\nmen"" who were bullies (the ones without money, who did\n\nnot get daddy to buy them out of the draft) got killed in\n\nbattle. War turned out not like another high school\n\nfootball game after all. And yet, isn't this what Michael\n\nMoore is saying? That it all starts then? That if everyone\n\nwill be a patriot to their school, things will be okay?\n\nNewsies don't ask hard ball questions of certain bullies\n\nanymore. They just have their hair blow dried properly,\n\ntheir make up done well, and they sit in front of a camera\n\nand they read what someone wrote for them. And it's all a\n\nhigh school setting. And that's where we are. Only it's a\n\nbillion times worse. A thousand American soldiers are\n\ndead. Ten or more thousand innocent Iraqis. And few\n\nbeen saying anything for such a long time. Just hot air.\n\nJust noise. Katie Couric thinks ""Navy SEALS rock""\n\nhowever.\n\n If Michael Moore has to have courage to make this film,\n\nif people have to have courage to go see it, or to tell\n\nothers about it, and not to have ""propaganda"" tossed in\n\ntheir faces by  people who are so well, informed, they've\n\nnot seen it, or any of his other movies, or have not read\n\nany of his books, then it seems the big quiet is on. Or was.\n\nI happened to like my high school. And it made me mad\n\nbeyond words when one of the bullies was graduated like\n\nall the rest of us even though his term paper for English\n\nwas copied word for word from his sister's term paper a\n\nfew years before when she was in the same class with the\n\nsame teacher. The teacher nailed him right there before us.\n\nThrew the paper right at him. Furious. Said he would not\n\ngraduate. She lied. Or was told to graduate him. Which\n\nshe did.\n\nIt always takes courage to tell the truth. To have the facts.\n\nTo do the job the news has abdicated itself from in such\n\ncowardice. That is what is called freedom. It takes no\n\ncourage to do nothing and pretend you do not see what\n\nyou see, or do not hear what you hear.\n\nDeath is not ""Hoppy Rides the Range:"" circa 1943.  I\n\ndidn't have to go fight a war though. I did not have to\n\nlose a son in a war. I did not have to receive that horrible\n\nphone call announcing with regrets....I didn't have to have\n\nchildren die in my arms. I didn't have to have my friend\n\nblown to bits beside me. I didn't have to have an arm or\n\nleg amputated. I didn't have to have my guts blown out\n\nand me with a bag on my side the rest of my life. I didn't\n\nhave to die for something that was not so.\n\nMoore reminds us that right now, right this second,\n\nsomeone is being cut apart by bullets, someone is being\n\nblown to bits by a bomb, someone, a child, for instance, is\n\ncrying in her sleep because there is nothing but a scream\n\nleft in her, in a tent hospital somewhere in the Mid East,\n\nand that scream is one heck of a lot more important, than\n\ngoing along, than just hoping it doesn't touch you,\n\nbecause it will, eventually.\n\nMichael Moore says so. Well, passionately, with the facts\n\nto back him up. And for anyone not obsessed with doing\n\nthe second grade versions of the dozens on him because\n\nof his physical characteristics, that should be the thing that\n\ncounts. Please see this movie.

He showed some of the additions on the DVD including numerous interviews with Iraqis before the illegal invasion, also were scenes from the infamous torture prison where Donald Rumsfeld ordered innocent Iraqis tortured.

1013;218.0;5.0;28.0;Yes, it was just a typo but here we are living in 1984. This movie made my heart ache for our soliders, our mothers and our country.

I highly recommend it to every person thirteen and over.;Welcome to 1984......America
1031;219.0;5.0;28.0;If 1/10 of the material Michael Moore has presented is true, it would be a damming indictment of the Bush administration.  Moore's policatal position is clear and this is a documentary with a strong left wing bias.  However, the issues he raises should be discussed as widely as possible (not much chance).  The sad thing is, most of what he says has a strong element of truth.  The relationship between Bush and the Saudi ruling class for example,must be examined further.;See This Film ASAP
1037;220.0;5.0;28.0;A TRUE patriot has loyalty to their country and its values and principles.  Having loyalty to your country is NOT the same as having loyalty to your government.

The film appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections.\n\nHow come the Bush administration lowered taxes AND went to war in Iraq?  Just something to think about.  That is all Fahrenheit 9/11 is aiming for - just for people to THINK about this stuff.\n\nYou are not required to believe anything.  That is the basis of a FREE country.

I did not vote for Bush, nor will I again.  The man has decimated our country.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is the best representation we have.\nYes, editing rules here.  But keep in mind, none of these people in this movie are actors.  These are real interviews, real facts, and lots of research time.

1368;224.0;5.0;28.0;"I feel that conservatives and liberals alike are looking at FAHRENHEIT 9/11 through the filter of their own agendas: it is not really an attack on the Republican Party, nor is it really a Democratic election-year commercial.  At heart, the film is an attack on political powers influenced by big business, which strives to manipulate the public through fear in order to turn a handsome profit.  But this is not to say that George W. Bush doesn't get a terrific beating here--he does, and so does his administration, with Ashcroft coming off as particularly ludicrous.\nIn the first third of the film, Moore goes to tremendous pains to demonstrate the existence of a ""good old boys"" network between the Bush family and Saudi money men, a network Moore claims facilitated the flight of wealthy Saudis from the United States in the immediate wake of 9/11.  While intriguing, Moore's position on this point is distinctly interpretive--but there is much more in the film that is not.\nIn the past, Moore has been accused of startling his targets into unstudied responses by unexpectedly leaping out at them with camera in hand, but no such accusation can arise here.  In FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Moore relies upon media coverage of Bush, and while the coverage is edited for effect there is no dodging the bullet: Bush was where he was, doing what he was doing, and saying what he was saying of his own free will and in full knowledge that the cameras were rolling.  If Bush emerges from this looking like a buffoon, he has no one to blame but himself.\nAt this point the film's edge turns razor sharp and deadly.  It is very easy to forget what someone said in an interview or speech several years ago--but it is also easy to roll the footage and remind us of it, not to mention pointing out various inconsistencies in the process.  But for all the film's Bush buffoonery, the most chilling aspect of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the portrait it paints of corporate greed and human tragedy.\nIn parts of the film Moore approaches his subject with a comic edge, pointing out some of the absurdities arising from the Patriot Act.  But simply put, there are a great many people making a great deal of money out of the United States' invasion of Iraq.  Corporations and investors rake in big bucks while, as one American solider puts it, an American trucker driving five miles a day in Iraq makes more in a week than a solider will make in a month.  When one adds to this chilling observation the fact that the Bush administration has done everything from cut military pay to seek closure of V.A. hospitals... well, it all adds up to a fairly poisonous portrait of both business and politics as usual.  Lives are lost, but no matter, at least so long as the polls are good and the money keeps rolling in.\nIs the film biased?  Without a doubt.  Is it speculative?  Yes, but only to a certain degree.  Will it make you stop and think?  You better believe it.  Recommended.\nGFT, Amazon Reviewer";Business And Politics As Usual

If it has no effect on you, if after watching the film you still judge that it is merely a ""propaganda piece"" and intend to vote for Bush/Cheney '04, at least you can say you've been well-informed.\nI think, however, you'll be moved. At the very least you should leave the theatre asking yourselves the following questions:\n- Does President Bush share my values, and is he looking out for America's best interest?\n- Was the war against Iraq justified, and is it worth the cost?\n- Who profits from the war? Are we safer because of it?\n- Is President Bush decisive or indecisive? Is he an effective leader? Is he honest?\nOnce you have seen Fahrenheit 9/11 I think you'll have far more questions about President Bush's motives than about Michael Moore's.\nI suspect some conservatives are reluctant to see the movie specifically because they're afraid to challenge their own beliefs.";See it and judge for yourself.

But, there's also the side benefit of laughing at Michael Moore (once again) and those who wear their nonsensical hatred for President Bush and America on their sleeves.\n\nMoore's phony ""documentary"" is nothing more than propaganda and disinformation.  He has a perverted hatred for President Bush and the United States, which is his only political philosophy and motivator.  Thankfully his philosophy of lies was soundly rejected on November 2 by the American people.  I hope Moore chokes on it.\n\nMoore should seek professional help.  Sitting through the first five minutes of this anti-American hate-filled garbage made me ill.\n\nThere are so many lies and fabrications in this film it's hard to know where to begin.  From September 11 (it wasn't George Bush who gave clearance to the Bin Laden family to leave the U.S. - it was Moore's hero Richard Clarke); to the images of happy Iraqi children under Saddam Hussein who are then attacked by the evil United States - it's all pure fiction. Only a moron like Michael Moore could argue that Iraqi's were happy under the rule of Saddam Hussein.\n\nMoore's hatred for George W. Bush is intertwined with his hatred for the United States and everything this country stands for.  While promoting this film in Europe, Moore said Americans were fat and lazy (he must be including himself) and look to invade and take over ""weaker"" and ""defenseless"" countries.  What nonsense.\n\nPlus, who is Michael Moore to criticize George Bush's family for their wealth -- Moore has made MILLIONS off this trash. Despite his claims, Moore is not a ""man of the people.""\n\nIt's also interesting to note that Osama Bin Laden uses the same talking points against President Bush and the U.S. as Moore does in this film.

Like most people in the world today, Americans want things to be simple, and in order for that to happen, they close their eyes and stick their head in the sands.  It's a little too easy to deceive people in this country, but the people in this country are a little too eager to be deceived, just as long as for the moment, they can feel a sense, though false, of security.\n\nGeorge Bush represents the worst in this country, and if he gets elected again, that might be a good thing.

590;234.0;5.0;27.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentary not about 9/11/2001, but about what Moore sees as a large scale corruption and incompetence on the part of the current federal administration. Moore unapologetically criticizes and questions the dubious outcome of the 2000 Presidential election, Bush and Cheney's ties to Saudi Oil Money, The real purpose of the War in Iraq and the large scale War Machine that stands to profit from 9/11 and the Iraq War.\n\nMichael Moore asks the questions that are on most people's minds (or would be if we scoured the news as painstakingly as Moore has) and shows us answers we may or may not like. Why did the U.S government allow the bin laden family to leave the country after 9/11 when all other planes were grounded? Did Bush ignore warnings that Al Qaeda was planning an attack? How much does Saudi money effect the United States economy?\n\nMoore pulls no punches, but if you think the democratic party comes out looking any rosier than the republicans, you need to think again. Moore is critical of our entire government as a whole and wants to know (as we all do) where the government went wrong and what they will do to protect us.\n\nMoore's documentary may shock you, and it will definitely open your eyes and get you thinking about the facts he presents, whether you agree with him or not.\n\nLove Moore or Hate him, his factchecking is nearly flawless (his website gives every citation you need) and his movie is uproariously funny. Moore simultaneously scares me about our nation's future enough to incite me to action (this IS an election year), and makes me laugh harder than I have at any comedy.\n\nThe movie shows us everyone from soldiers in Iraq on Christmas Eve, to Taliban leaders, of course to our president himself.\n\nThe special features have added scenes and extended interviews, including Condolezza Rice's testimony before the 9/11 comission. Moore doens't twist your arm, but he does present a convincing argument for why he feels the way he does.

705;236.0;5.0;27.0;"Before voting on November 2nd, be sure to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  Maybe it won't change your mind, maybe it will.  At the worst, you might come away with a better idea about why at least half the population of this country and most of the rest of the world are praying to see the end of the most appalling presidency since Warren G. Harding, and possibly since the formation of the United States of America.\n\nThe four years since the Bush administration took over in 2000 have truly put the previous eight years of the Clinton administration in perspective.  Back in the 90s I actually believed for a time that Clinton should be impeached for daring to question the definition of ""is"" before the House/Senate investigative committee.  Now it's time to admit that that was a mistake.  The Clinton administration gave us 8 years of never-before and never-again prosperity, and 8 years of relative peace. Clinton's misbehavior was child's play compared with Bush's Orwellian world of manipulation, spin, and double-speak that we live in now.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" documents this transition from the Clinton era to the Bush era, starting with the stolen election of 2000 and the complicit undermining of free speech by the U.S. media, and moving to the questionable relationship of the Bush family to the Saudi royals.  Of course, most heartbreaking are the stories of soldiers and their families who are most devastated by the decisions of the neocons.\n\nIn just 4 years the U.S. economy has gone from a record surplus to record debt -- the highest in U.S. history.  And how many wars have we been in since 2000 -- I've lost count.  But based on the nightly news and the Republican spin machine, you'd never guess that anything was at all amiss.  ""Keep on shopping"", they say, and everything will turn out fine.\n\nEven though at one time I thought Clinton should be impeached, I'm now firmly convinced that Bush, Cheney, Rove, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Ashcroft, Condi Rice, and maybe Colin Powell should all go to jail.  Sure, other administrations have ruined the economy and driven us into war, but this one stole an entire election, exposed a CIA operative, and fabricated and lied about the reasons for going to war -- all treasonable offenses.  You can bet that if any Democrat had committed these crimes we'd be hearing about it 24/7 on Fox News.\n\nAnd if anyone thinks that things can't get any worse, just wait.  The only thing keeping this administration under any kind of restraint at all is the fear of not getting re-elected.  A second term will make the first look like a day at Disneyland...\n\nAnd speaking of Disney, don't forget to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11""!  You may not agree with everything that Michael Moore says, but the images are unforgettable. If you don't like listening to Mr. Moore, try watching with the sound turned off, the footage speaks for itself.  In those images you'll witness the catastrophic consequences of unchecked and misguided power wielded by a government that has only a very tenuous claim to legitimacy, in the first place.  Truly, these are themes that echo through the ages...";Hooray for the 1st Amendment!
707;237.0;5.0;27.0;"Every Democrat, every Independent, and every Republican in this country should see this film.  The depth of Michael Moore's love for this great country and his fellow average Americans is clearly evident in Fahrenheit 9/11.  Far too many of the policies being adopted by our ""elected"" government officials are created behind closed doors in secret - and contrary to what the majority of Americans want.  This film gives the average American access to more actual information - rather than the filtered news, empty sound-bytes and catch phrases that are repeated ad nauseum.  With so many multi-millionaires in his cabinet, is it any wonder President Bush is out of touch with the ""common man""? Michael Moore does a masterful job of exposing the lies and inspiring Americans to get off their butts and exercise their privilege to vote with a better grasp of what's going on today in our country.";Every American MUST See This Film!
710;238.0;5.0;27.0;"I continue to be amazed at folks that condemn this movie without having seen it.  I would implore everyone, regardless of where you sit, to at least watch it before you dare to trash it.  Anyone who has seen Michael's documentaries knows that he takes some editorial liberties.  However, watch only Bush's face as he sits in the elementary classroom, the minutes slowly ticking, after he is told that ""America is under attack"" by his aide.  Then, watch the protesters at the inaugural parade.  Then, ask yourself, ""why didn't we see or read about any of this via our national media?""  If nothing else, Moore gives us information that we, as free Americans, should have been given by our free press.  Would that be the case, we wouldn't need the Michael Moores of this nation.";You have to SEE it to evaluate it.
787;239.0;5.0;27.0;"I saw this at the theater twice and both times it was phenomenal. Everyone should see this film more than once. Michael Moore does not go easy on the Democrats either; he just tells what happened from the ""election"" of George W. to 9/11 and its aftermath. And it's a good thing he had the guts to do it, because so many people just have no idea what our government is doing for us, or, more likely, for themselves. This documentary is realistic, not perfect and polished, but I cannot emphasize strongly enough how honest, moving, thorough and powerful it is. Michael Moore is a hero, and a true, unafraid American. I highly recommend this film as a mandatory for anyone who has an interest in seeing the truth, and using it to better society as a whole.";Wake Up Call For U.S. Citizens
916;240.0;4.0;27.0;"I thought it was a little long.  Moore could have used an editor, but when you're the writer, director, and producer of a film--easily the largest-grossing documentary film in history--perhaps there is a reluctance on the part of anyone to cut the master's work.  And anyway, anyone could see that Moore wanted a little overkill to emphasis his various points: all those Sheiks of Arabi and glad-handed oil millionaires pressing flesh, all the George W. cowboy hats and little boy grins, all the dead and bleeding bodies, the limbless soldiers, the excited bombs a-bursting in surround sound--all the tragic absurdities of the spoiled little boy presidency--Moore knew--needed to be repeated over and over again lest the mass American mind miss the point.\n\nOkay, I have mixed feelings about this film.  It's not exactly a documentary--there is no pretense of objectivity, nor is it a full-blown burlesque of George W. Bush and everything that he is about--although it is close to that.  George W. appears often: swinging a golf club and asking us to admire his stroke; knitting his brows and allowing us to imagine that he is thinking; shaking hands with grinning Sheiks and oil-dipped Texas buds while petrol-dollars take to flight; and all the while the camera closes in; and then the sequences are repeated to comedic effect.\n\nBut I think for sophisticated viewers, those who have been keeping tabs on Bush 43 for some time now, all of this is already known only too well.  Such viewers may find Moore's cinematic guidance a bit heavy-handed.  For such viewers this film may drag a bit in spots.\n\nI was thinking, too, while I watched all the shots of Bush II at play and pretend work and behind the podium practicing his oratory, that what Michael Moore really wanted to find is some footage of George W. at prayer.  If only the mendacious president could be caught kneeling before an altar or in a pew after the deed has been done, like Claudius in Shakespeare's Hamlet--how appropriate it would be.  A voice-over might exclaim: ""My words go up, but my thoughts remain below...""\n\nA nice bit was Moore's satirical attempt to stop congressmen on the street coming and going to work and get them to sign up their children and grandchildren for the Iraqi war.  Many chuckles there as our good representatives stare wide-eyed and/or flee in astonished horror.  How rude that gruff man with the microphone!\n\nI also liked (but found tedious and a bit obvious) the long drawn-out tale of the middle-American mother who identified herself as a conservative Democrat, a woman sure of the righteousness of American intent until it is HER son that comes up dead in Iraq.  And then she turns.  She sees, she understands: these are REAL people dying, getting blown up.  As she cries for her son, we the audience see the glorious ""precision bombing"" that so delighted Donald Rumsfeld mocked macabre by this personal tragedy.  Moore induces a nice clip of the Secretary of Defense waxing ecstatic on one of his favorite subjects (precision bombing).  And, although this is not emphasized, a substantial number of US injured and dead are the result of friendly fire gone awry.  Yes, she speaks too long and too self-indulgently, but in the end who can fault her or deny her feelings?\n\nOne of Moore's more damning points and one that Bush and Buds cannot squirm out of is the government-sponsored exodus of the Bin Laden family and assorted Bin Laden family members safely out of this country immediately following the 9/11 attacks.  Why would the Bush administration make it such a top priority that such people be flown out the country?  Wouldn't it make more sense to keep them here, at least until they could be questioned?\n\nOverall one is left with the indelible impression that George W. is a child playing with the weapons of state of the most powerful country in the history of the world without the slightest awareness of their awesome effects.  He is a frat boy playing fighter pilot, mouthing empty cliches about ""mission accomplished,"" while all about him the real world of poverty and death go on unobserved and uncomprehended.";A little long, but effective

However, I tried to view Moore's piece objectively and independently.\n\nThe movie itself was absolutely brilliant, Moore's witty and clever narrative conveys the message that he tries to bring across to his audience with clarity and humor. His choice of startling and sometimes shocking photos and video clips have a raw, truthful, and real-life feel to it.\n\nOne of my favorite scenes was when Bush was given the news regarding the attacks on the twin towers while sitting in a classroom, reading a storybook titled ""My Pet Goat"". He sits there for SEVEN MINUTES, unsure of what to do, making faces and looking worried. How did we ever elect this man to be our Commander-in-Chief?\n\nMoore exposes what he calls the ""lies"" of our current administration. He depicts how Bush ""stole"" the election in Florida, how Bush went into Iraq only for profits and not for the supposed weapons of mass destruction (what, a few hand grenades?), and how Bush's close ties with the Saudi royal family affect American taxpayers.\n\nI would advise everyone to see it first, before making a pre-bias about Moore or the film itself. It definitely raises some interesting issues and questions, and I think that this country needs a ""regime change"" as soon as possible to save the integrity and international respect our country used to have.";A movie that is thought-provoking and exposes the untruths

I see all of these reviews saying it is anti-american propaganda... qnd that we should read the 9/11 commission. Believe it or not the government still lies. This film tells it how it is. This film genuinely can change your mind and open your eyes, and if you still beleive that George Bush is saving america through christianity and saving Iraq through changing them to the demoicratic system, you are horribly wrong...

In a country of Fox News and the rest of the right winged media that is used by the government for it's propaganda (tanks on their easy going way to Baghdad, Terror alert levels, not allowed to show pictures of dead or hijacked americans...)it is definately needed to see the other extreme. Moore never denied that this movie was an anti-Bush campaign movie.\n\n After watching Fox News for a few hours and this movie afterwards you can find your own truth somewhere in the middle.\n\n The only criticism I really have is the patriotism in this movie. I guess you have to see that the audience this movie was basically made for is american. And I experienced when i lived in the US that you don't have a chance in the world to get anybody on your side if you don't include how much you love your country and how patriotic you are. As soon as people might think you are not patriotic you are most definately gonna loose them. You are unamerican.... hey, what is ""american!""?? Is it not to ensure that everyone has health insurance? Or to bomb countries for oil or to ignore the rest of the world and dictate it? well, than Michael Moore is definately unamerican. Thank God he is!\n\n What I also did not like was aying that the american border is not patroled enough, at least the part that Moore shows in this film, is just another way to frighten people. It also does not go with the main message that I read in this movie - that danger is not coming from outside the country, it's ruling this country.\n\n Well, just some random thoughts that are on my mind. If you live in America, go and watch this movie. if you live in Europe you probably already know everything said in there. It's worth watching anyways. It's Michael Moore!";it's Michael Moore

1256;249.0;5.0;27.0;"I and my neighbor saw this movie the first day it opened, on the first showing of the day. While much of what was presented was somewhat old information, some of it was new to me. The very real and in depth relationship between the Bin Ladens and the Bush family, running decades prior to the 2000 election. The CIA briefings that Bush I gets daily before going off for meetings with the saudi royals/bin ladens and their joint business interests in the Carlysle Group. I found it interesting that the same day this movie came out with that information, the Carlysle Group announced their move from military arms production interests, diversifying into buying up media companies. HMMMMM\nMichael Moore did get his quirky, somewhat imflammatory sense of humor into the film, but by and large, the film showed public film footage, real life stories and an appalling expose on both the democrats and republicans distortions of our political process, intelligence, and national and foriegn policy. While the Bush presidency gets most of the hits, he does not discriminate and shows the lack of integrity inherent within the democratic party as well.\nI've been a lifelong registred republican. I will be changing my status to independent after this election, unless of course I am illegally removed from the voter polls too. What remains with me most about this movie is that the terrorist threat is not an outside concern for me as much as the lies, deceptions, greed, lust and megalomania of our own politicians. Terrorist threat? Mostly from within.\nFor those of you watching the reviews on cable, I encourage you to go see the movie for yourselves. Joe Scarbrough on his program belittles the movie nightly.

1295;250.0;5.0;27.0;"Scrolling through the reviews, this movie basically gets only two scores:  either 5 stars or 1 star, and I'm sure those who rated it 1 star are cursing Amazon for not having a no stars option.  It is amazing how polarized the viewing audience is over this film.  Then again, this is politics.  I have stuck with the trend and have rated this film 5 stars.  I thought this was a great film.  Does it have it's flaws?  Yes.  Is it biased?  Of course.  Does it push an agenda?  Why else was it made?!  The reason I thought that this movie was great wasn't due to my political views or a hatred of Bush or anti-American sentiment.  Simply put, this movie does what any good movie should:  it makes you think.  It makes you question.  After the movie finished, the majority of the audience stuck around to converse about it and actually had to be reminded to leave by theater staff.  Whether you agree with the message being put forth in this movie or not, you have the responsibility to at least hear it out.  It's his right to be able to express it.  I'm tired of seeing negative review after negative review that consist purely of something along the lines of ""Micheal Moore is a fat slob who eats a lot.  All he does is lie in this movie.  He's stupid.  Anyone who like this movie is stupid.  Bush rules.  Whooo!"" (Typing all in CAPS is optional.)  And many of the negative reviews come from individuals who haven't even seen the movie!  I wish I was all-knowing like these people and could form opinions without having to know all the facts and hear both sides out.  If you don't like this movie, tell me why.  Counter the views presented in this movie with your own views backed up by facts, instead of simply degenerating into name calling and insult hurling.  Knowledge is power and as such this movie is a must see for all.  And you know what?  I am looking forward to seeing the movie that is almost certainly soon to follow that will express the other side of this story.  And you can bet it won't be because I plan on rating it 1 star and saying Bush sucks and everyone who likes him is stupid and the maker of that film has questionable personal hygiene.";A film worth seeing by all, not just by half the population
1403;251.0;5.0;27.0;You have to see this film!  As some who have written before me have failed to note, Farenheit 911 is an op-ed piece.  The facts have been checked scrupulously by Moore and a team of fact checkers and attorneys.  And boy are the facts damning.\nFarenheit blew me away. I laughed, I cried and I cursed.  I walked out of the movie theatre and my whole body was tingling.  The movie is a courageous exposee of what corporate America does not want all of us to see.  Moore brilliantly shows how corporations and the rich congressmen who answer to them, are willing to shove our country into war to increase their profit margin.  This movie is more than an indictment of Bush, it is an indictment of a system which would allow Bush and Congress to lie to us and lead us half the way around the world to line the pockets of the wealthy.\nMichael Moore is a courageous hero of the lower and middle classes.  You need to see this movie.;Moore is a true patriot
1409;252.0;5.0;27.0;"At about the midway point of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore includes a clip of an interview with Britney Spears. In it, Spears voices full confidence in President Bush and his administration and says that she believes everything he says. If enough people in this country see Fahrenheit 9/11, Spears is going to be among a very, very, very small minority in the United States.\nMoore clearly shows how the Bush administration, from day one (and even before that), has manipulated facts, played on the nation's fears and flat-out lied to the American people in order to further its political and financial goals. With almost unnerving precision, Moore shows how the Bush family cultivated business ties with the Bin Laden family and sought to preserve those ties even after 9/11. Clips of testimony and interviews by members of the Bush administration asserting the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction are followed by clips of those same people, before 9/11, asserting that Iraq had no such weapons. He shows how the Patriot Act has given the United Government license to pry into the private lives of its citizens and execute a measure of control and manipulation that should be illegal under the Constitution. And, in footage CBS, ABC, NBC and, especially, Fox News never show the American people, Moore documents how the war in Iraq has dessimated lives, both American and Iraqi.\nThis is clearly Moore's most somber and sober film yet. Roger and Me, The Big One and even Bowling for Columbine had moments of great humor and big laughs. In contrast, even when Fahrenheit 9/11 uses humor, the film still maintains its tone of anger, anguish and despair over the corruption of the Bush Aministration and the lives lost or ruined by the war in Iraq. By the time Moore interviews the mother of a soldier killed in the war, the audience isn't laughing and is instead on the verge of tears.\nMoore thankfully spares the audience the horrible footage of 9/11/01, not because he feels it is irrelevant, but because he doesn't want to exploit our memories. The sounds of the attack, the reaction of bystanders to the horror and the grief of the survivors and family members of the victims tells the story powerfully. He knows that no one who was old enough to be aware what was happening that day will ever forget what they saw and what they felt.\nIn contrast, the footage of the Americans and Iraqis killed and wounded shown is often very graphic in nature and might be too much for some viewers to handle. It shocked me, but I thought it was necessary to show how much the media, even the supposedly liberal leaning mainstream media, slanted its coverage, omitted footage that could be construed as un-American or negative in nature and essentially became an unofficial cheerleader for the Bush Administration's cause.\nBy playing upon the nation's post 9/11 fears, the Bush administration was able to sell a war on Iraq that was already in the planning stages before the attacks. And worst of all, Moore shows that, in many instances, the root reason for waging war wasn't idealogical, but instead for financial gain through the awarding of fat government contracts to help rebuild Iraq. While watching Fahrenheit 9/11, I kept thinking of Donald Sutherland's statement in Oliver Stone's JFK that ""the organizing principle for any society is for war."" It's easy to dismiss such a statement when watching a dramatization. However, it's not nearly as easy when it's shoved into your face with supporting evidence during a documentary.\nBefore I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, I expressed doubts that a documentary could influence an election. Now, however, I'm not so sure. Michael Moore has crafted a film that trashes President Bush, but presents a lot of evidence to back him up. George W. Bush had better hope that Britney Spears can get a lot of pro-Bush voters to the polls, because Fahrenheit 9/11 is going to make a lot of people angry at him.\nNOTE: My only criticism of Moore is that he berates Bush for the way he won the election in 2000 without also acknowledging that had Ralph Nader, who Moore strongly supported, not run, Bush might now be just an ex-Governor instead of President.";Well, At Least Bush Has Britney Spears' Vote ...
68;253.0;1.0;24.0;"Many left-leaning people like myself were disgusted at the deliberately misleading elements in this film; for example, Michael Moore's cruel and completely slanderous attempt to imagine verbally George W. Bush's thoughts as Bush is informed of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center. Moore suggests that Bush was thinking only of Saudi oil investments. None of us knew what was going on in those early minutes of the terror strike on the Trade Center, as the unthinkable took place. Anyone who has taken an introductory course in Logic learns of the fallacies of making logical assumptions based on innuendo. I was just revolted by Moore's completely immoral, hate-filled screed of a 'film'. Moore also insulted the intelligence of the American people by assuming that they would believe his innuendo-filled comments. And this is where he went wrong: the American people were/are not as stupid as Moore believes them to be, and many people were insulted by Moore's arrogant attitude and assumptions, as he spoke down to them as if they could not think for themselves. And in their disgust at Moore's condescension, and ad hominem portrayal of a man who, whether you liked his policies or not, just happened to have the job of president of the United States at the time of the horrific terror attack, many viewers of this movie quite likely voted FOR George W. Bush, not against him. I truly believe that this shoddy film actually caused more people to vote FOR George W. Bush in November 2004, than against him. Moore's arrogance and carelessness boomeranged on him. If Moore had not made this movie, perhaps G. W. Bush would not have been reelected.\n  I had somewhat enjoyed Moore's simplistic earlier effort, 'Bowling For Columbine', and was expecting much better than this trashy attempt at money-making through slander-based controversy. I should have known better; Moore is an entertainer, and not an insightful political analyst by any stretch of the imagination. Thank God that many Americans (including left-leaning ones like me) have something called education and/or common sense and can recognize lies and deception like the kind Moore attempts to foist off on the public.\n  An interesting related read is 'The Trouble with Islam. A Wake-Up Call For Honesty and Change' by Canadian Muslim lesbian author Irshad Manji, who also dismisses Michael Moore.\n  That Moore's trash won the 'prestigious' Palme D'Or film award in France is only because of the ever-present and fashionable anti-Americanism prevalent in French 'intellectual' circles, and yet another symptom of the cultural malaise that France has experienced in recent years, and about which much has been written.\n  Note also political commentator Andrew Sullivan's creation of the 'Moore Award', for ""divisive, bitter, and intemperate left-wing rhetoric"".";the film that got George W.

640;261.0;5.0;26.0;"Moore goes for the gut (no pun intended) with a somewhat simplistic view of an extremely complex web of intrigue. It's simplistic in part because to delve into the details you might first want a degree in 20th Century geopolitics. It's simplistic also because many of the details are, frankly, unbelievable. If you watch the film, you'll learn about ""Bandar Bush,"" the Saudi prince who is treated like a member of the Bush family. And I don't know about you, but I never heard of ANY bin Laden before 9/11, so isn't it a strange coincidence that the Bush family had business dealings with the bin Ladens? Moore doesn't dig much deeper than that; however, if you care to do some reading elsewhere, you'll find that the details are even more incriminating. Not incriminating in the sense that George W. Bush knew in advance about 9/11, or that he caused it in some way, or even that he let Saudis leave. It's incriminating in the sense that over the course of history, actions have consequences (mostly unintended). And if you examine the interrelationships among the players in the Bush administration, you see very clearly the web of ideology, mistakes, and power that inexorably led us to where we are today. The chickens have come home to roost. Is any individual responsible or evil? No. But in a sense, our country itself is not the TARGET of ""evildoers."" It is in the crossfire. There's no way to explain all this in a movie review, so here's one factoid in the form of a question: Who's the highest ranking Afghan in the U.S. government? Zalmay Khalilzad. He works for Condi Rice on the National Security Council. He was one of the officials in the U.S. State Dept. who lobbied to arm the Muhajadeen with Stinger missiles against the Soviets. He was also a Unocal advisor in the 1990s working on risk analyses for an oil pipeline that was to traverse Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Muhajadeen was the forerunner of the Taliban, and Khalilzad supported the Taliban as a stabilizing force. Now don't get me wrong. I am not making any insinuations about evil intent or duplicity. I'm pointing out that this ""web of intrigue"" is very real. You can't dismiss it simply by calling Michael Moore a liar and that's that. We are now fighting the same people that individiuals in the Bush administration armed and supported. And we deposed a dictator who was our friend when it served our short-sighted interests. And the justification that you get from our leadership is that ""they hate our freedom"" and ""they hate our way of life."" It's not that simple. They hate specific things that have been done, and you should be shocked that these same people leading our country are so deeply entrenched in the roots of the conflict. Michael Moore's film can only touch on this, but the fact is that the reality is more shocking than he even attempts to portray.";You Can't Dismiss It
650;262.0;5.0;26.0;I thought Michael Moore did an excellent job with this documentary. He shows you the facts right there on paper and video....there's no faking what is shown here...it is the truth! How disgraceful that our president could mislead and manipulate the American people the way he did. And how everything Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. have done is all for their greed of money and Iraqi oil, not to mention the billions of dollars in business deals the Bush's have with Saudi investors in America. Oh and lets not forget the longterm business relationship between the Bush's and the BinLaden families (which is why the BinLaden families were the only people allowed to fly out of the US only two days after Sept. 11th) Bush has to protect his investors...the hell with questioning the families about Osama and his whereabouts...their money is more important to Bush. Whether you're a Democrat or Republican this documentary is a must to see. And by the way when Bush and Cheney testified at the 9/11 hearings they would only do so if they weren't put under oath...gee you think they told the whole truth and nothing but the truth! Hah! Hah!;THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT BUSH AND HIS DECEIT TO AMERICANS!!
658;263.0;5.0;26.0;The movie is wonderfull and show us that Bush is a liar and that he is using his power for his own interests.\n\nPlease, american people, vote for John Kerry and not for Bush!;Thank you Michael Moore!
712;264.0;5.0;26.0;"In reading the reviews currently available on Amazon, it makes me sad to see the number of people that are unable to set aside their own personal political dogma to see the brilliant job Michael Moore has done with this movie.  When a director takes on a project, his goal is to relay the emotions and themes he chooses to his audience in the most effective method possible.  Moore has succeeded in this film to a degree rarely achieved by most filmakers.\n\nThere are two major camps of critisism with respect to this film.  The first claims that Moore's film is factually inacurrate.  Moore certainly uses the film to support a political agenda, but his pain staking fact-checking belies critisism on this front.  Those claiming a large number of factual mistakes are simply so wed to their own dogma as to make their ability to freely view any information that critisizes their beliefs impossible.  These are dangerous people, for they are willing to disregard truth and relpace it with blind faith.  This is all right (and actually essential) in a religeous context, but unforgiveable in a political context.\n\nThe next group critize Moore for not making an unbiased film.  These people miss the point.  Moore wasn't trying to make an unbiased film.  He did a brilliant job of making a very biased film.  That was his intent.  Anyone hoping to be successful in making films themselves should watch this film intently to see how much it takes to be so successful in achieving one's vision.\n\nAs a vehicle for Moore's vision, this is a brilliant film.  Proof is how well this film has connected with the general population of this country.  As much as people who disagree with the philosophy of this film want to Bushize the film (that is, keep repeating that it is a bad film over and over and over in the belief that if you say it enough times it becomes the truth), it is a magnificently directed film; and one with important lessons, even for the people that are offended by its partisanism.";Seeing Past the Political Rhetoric

It's been a while since I played the ""If you don't your a (...).."" playground game.  I feel like Moore sucked half my intelligence away with this trainwreck of a fiction piece wrapped in the ""documentary"" label that it ill deserves.  Here you go folks, DOCUMENTARY - Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter.  There's the definition, and whether or not you can bring yourself to understand this, Moore ignores the facts he doesn't like, and he is the king of editorializing.  So while this film contains some facts, it pulls them away from other facts and presents them in a way that leads you by your cattle-like nose ring to Moore's twisted view.  I'm not a Republican, I have the freedom of not believing any of the parties, so I can approach everything with doubt.  Do yourself a favor people, educate yourself, don't swallow what Moore shovels to you and call it the final truth.";Get off your soapbox.........

Every single Bush supporter I come across always says this, 'It's propaganda, it's propaganda!' I KNOW what propaganda is, all right?

Here are some Polish facts on the so-called War on Terror:\n\n*70 percent of the Polish population didn't want to go to war with Iraq. Not twenty percent. Not forty. SEVENTY.\n\n*You need a VISA to go to America from Poland. What's with the freakin' VISA??? Our famous Lech Walesa tried to knock some sense into Bush's head, but he didn't pay attention. I guess he was too busy playing golf.\n\n*Even though Poland supposedly pulled out of Iraq, there are STILL 200,000 Polish troops stationed there. I'm not making this up. But hey, who cares about the Poles? What do you know about Poland anyway? The Pope? Polish jokes???\n\nOkay, I'm getting away from the subject. My point is, Farenheit 9/11 is NOT PROPAGANDA.

857;268.0;5.0;26.0;I saw this film in the theater and I plan to buy a copy to loan out as well as show in my home.  Mike Moore stands up for the Americans who seem to matter the least to our government.  The young soldiers, recruited from low income neighborhoods and malls.  They are now dying at an average of 3 a day in Iraq. This movie tells you why.  The fact behind every comment made can be found at [...]  I have heard a great deal of criticism of this film and the facts, yet the remarks are unspecific when it comes to  the content of the film because they are being made by people who have NEVER seen the film.  Like John McCain.  Nothing makes a person look dumber than to make a critical remark about a film, book, etc without first-hand knowledge.  I have yet to hear any of the critics of this film explain why there are only 8 state troopers in Oregon?  Why is the FBI wasting its manpower and resources on peace groups composed of cookie-eating Americans?  Or an elderly man, who should have the right to his opinion?  Why didn't the Congress take time to read the Patriot Act?  Why wasn't the Bin Laden family detained for questioning about his whereabouts?  Why did Powell and Rice both assure Americans in early 2001 that Saddam wasn't a threat and had no capability for building wmd only to flip-flop after 9/11?  Why were only 11 thousand troops sent after Osama and the Taliban?  Why were they allowed to escape? Why is George I portrait hanging in a Saudi palace?  Why was George I and Bin Laden's brother-in-law in a business meeting together on 9/11?  Where is our unbiased, un-corporate owned media?  You will not come away from this film untouched.  The first half is hilarious at times while the last half is heart-wrenching.  Every American should see this film and start asking questions of our elected officials.  I'm so glad to see it ranks #2 on the Amazon sales list.  Maybe the average American is not as apathetic as the Bush Administration hopes.;Stand Up and Cheer
858;269.0;4.0;26.0;Michael Moore isn't a god or anything more than a fine filmmaker but I praise him for speaking out in such uncertain times.  Usually his films are about him parading around getting people in uncomfortable situations but in FAHRENHEIT he smartly lets the footage do the talking.  If anyone makes a fool of BUSH and his policies it's Bush.  Michael Moore is just presenting the obvious truths about our misguided leader.  Anyone who bashes the film is just in denial.  A very powerful film!;He lets Bush make a fool of himself.  Which is easy!

867;271.0;5.0;26.0;I am not necessarily a democrat or a republican, thus a swing voter. This allows me to avoid party line bias. When voting for president, i generally vote on my gut instinct, for who i think will do the best job of running the country. Up until September, i was like most, not impressed by either Kerry or Bush, waiting for a chance to hear what they had to say and listen and read some media reports. I heard about the movie and had a difficult time getting it, as most did not carry it due to fear, which struck me as odd.  Finally I watched Farenheit 9/11 and was disgusted by the arrogance and lies of this administration.  Michael Moore presents facts that are undisputable and allow you the viewer to think hard.  Facts are from several different reputable sources that cannot all bend the truth. It is clear that Mr Moore has a grudge against President G.W. Bush, he shows that at the beginning, but in the movie he presents facts to support his views which make it difficult to say he is  bending the truth for his own reasons. After hearing the controversy surrounding Mr. Moore and the government and republican effort to silence him, I was glad to finally get to see this documentary that said what everyone else was afraid of saying in fear of the RNC wrath. This movie really changed my mind about President Bush and his administration. Facts presented here about the President Bush's administration, policies and practices were an eye opener.  A lot of stuff i did not know about. This is not the way that this our country aught to be run! As a Texan and former Bush supporter I believed that this movie was biased and a lie, but I was challenged to watch the facts presented in the movie then think about them. Let's just say bush doesnt get my vote anymore. The whole issue about the Bin Laden family being flown out of the country after 9/11 especially strikes me as odd.  The fact that they should have been detained for questioning cannot be argued. Bush family ties to rich oil Saudis and business with the Carlyle group which did business with the Bin Laden family!  Question the motives of the war in Iraq, knowing that most of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, none came from Iraq. In fact there are no known ties to Iraq or WMD's.  So why aren't the Saudis being questioned??? After all, Bin Ladin is a Saudi himself. Why aren't we attacking Saudi Arabia?? Why aren't we concentrating our efforts in Afghanistan? that's where Bin Laden is! Why are the rich and administration favored companies fighting over the oil fields in iraq? I thought this war was about terrorism?  Why are the military (using our hard earned tax money) guarding the oil fields  more than anything else in Iraq(and dying in the process)? Is the death of all these military personnel (1000 and growing) worth it?  What if one of them was my kid, brother or cousin?  Is Iraq on its way to becoming another Vietnam like crisis? Is this about oil? If so who benefits, and are we likely to give up control of the region if Bush returns to office?  Will Iraq elections be fair (or will he be US controlled for oil purposes)? Are we suggesting that Iraqis and other countries take our place  and pay for a war we started? Will they willingly do that? are they less human? Were all the peaceful diplomatic efforts exhausted before the war started? Did Bush go against common sense? Is Bush's arrogance hurting our foreign trade relations and deficit?  Does he even care about the deficit? At least watch this film before you vote, and figure out why the RNC is trying so hard to silence Mr Moore. Think hard about the facts.  I don't think the American public is ignorant as this administration probably thinks, i think we are in the dark about the truth that is hidden from us.  If many knew the truth they would clearly change their minds too. No wonder the RNC is trying hard to silence Michael Moore.;THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE: FAHRENHEIT 9/11
931;272.0;1.0;26.0;Make no mistake.  This trash is about Michael Moore making money for Michael Moore.  Another trash film.  What's disturbing is not that idiots like Moore make these films, but that other idiots who watch it, believe the distortions.;Trash
933;273.0;1.0;26.0;I viewed Fahrenheit 9/11 just to see what all the fuss is about.  I went to the theater with an open mind, but left the theater with a thorough disgust for Michael Moore's blatant disregard for journalistic integrity.  I went to the theater to see a movie made by a professional, but instead saw a movie made by an amateur.  Take a few truths and make them lies, take a few lies and make them truths, and apparently, you have a Michael Moore film.  Seriously, if you decide to watch this movie, I ardently recommend that you also read the bi-partisan 9/11 Commission Report (ISBN 0393326713.)  Let's face it, Mr. Moore, George Bush isn't responsible for 9/11 -- al-Qaeda is.  Perhaps you've heard of Osama bin Laden?  Additionally, Mr. Moore, the 9/11 Commission Report is just as critical of Bill Clinton as it is of George Bush.  Why didn't you give Clinton the same level of vitriol as you did Bush in your movie?  Mr. Moore, you make the First Amendment sound like a bad idea.;Irresponsible Journalism -- We Need Less of Moore
988;274.0;5.0;26.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 might turn out to be the most important film ever made.  The pathetic attempts to downplay this cinematic phenomenon are as transparent as the attempts to slander its director and as disingenuous as the administration that it exposes.  Of course, the film's political and social impact would not be possible if not for its artistic excellence.\n\nAs for the charge of propaganda, I think John Berger addressed this quite eloquently in his recent article in the Guardian:\n\n""To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite.\n\nThis single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former.""\n\nLike Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 911 is alternately humorous and gut-wrenching.  We laugh at our inept and clownish president and then shudder at the consequences of his policies.  Moore hits hard with images of dead and critically wounded Iraqis.  One scene, in which a furious and indignant Iraqi man places a mutilated baby in the back of a corpse-filled pick-up and vows revenge, is particulary affecting.\n\nMoore also interviews a mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq.  She is disillusioned - lost.  ""Why?"" she asks.  It is the right question and one answered quite thoroughly by this movie.  Are you not curious?";Propaganda?  Yeah, right.
1039;275.0;5.0;26.0;"You will notice that most one star reviews of the films assert lies within the film Fahrenheit 9/11, without being able to identify any of these lies: It's a shame that they can't, because Michael Moore has stated repeatedly, to numerous publications around the world, that he will give $10,000 to whoever can prove he's lied: And so far, he has yet to pay so much as a single cent out.\n\nThis is not surprising, when you consider most of those critical of the film haven't even seen it, or much less know much about Moore himself. The film doesn't refer to September 11th? There is harrowing sound footage in Fahrenheit 9/11 of one of the towers being struck, the audience left in the dark to listen to the people's terrified screams, and imagine the horror they must be witnessing. He's only made two films? His first film was actually ""Roger And Me""...\n\nNor will any of the critics dare answer Fahrenheit 9/11's most powerful and closing imagery: that of Lila Lipscomb. A woman who patriotically hangs the Stars and Stripes outside her home every morning. A woman who encourages the local children of poverty-stricken Flint to enlist in order in order to secure a future from themselves. But also a woman who is reduced to collapsing in tears outside the White House, by someone so lacking in dignity that they'd accuse a grieving mother, an inch from her face, of lying about having a son killed in Iraq.\n\nAnd at current rates of losses, there will be 1,000 Lila Lipscomb's close to the anniversary of September 11th this year. Propaganda? No, the simple, awful truth, irrespective of whether you accept the earlier, more Bush focused part of the film or not. Her son, Michael Pedersen IS dead. As are the uncounted tens of thousands of sons and daughters of Iraqi men and women too: Fahrenheit 9/11 shows us one such mother, digging through the rubble of her former home, desperately seeking her daughter who is buried under it... We see her screaming for Allah to save her, to explain what her little girl has done to deserve such a fate... and then her grief wracked mind tries to bargain for her daughters life: Why doesn't Allah kill American children instead of the children of the devoted? But if he did, would that bring her daughter back? Does killing Iraqi's bring the victims of September 11th back? Or does the circle of violence just continue to claim ever more victims?\n\nThis IS the reality of War. Fahrenheit 9/11 simply reminds you of it, and asks you if it was really worth paying in this War's particular case.\n\nAnd this is supposed to be the essence of what Democracy actually is: To inform the people of the true state of affairs, and ask them to make choices upon what they would prefer it to be. Screaming at grieving mothers about lying, or putting your fingers in your ears so you can't hear the laments of those who must dig amongst their homes for what's left of their family is the true Anti-Americanism, because it attempts to deny the right of people to make an informed choice. And that is really what the One Star Warriors here are engaged in: They would prefer for you to not know the true reality of War, for fear that you will make a different choice regarding it than themselves.\n\nBut EVERYONE should be required to see the true face of what is occurring in Iraq, and what is still occurring in Iraq:  Because what occurs there means that many, many mothers will never see their own children's faces again... and we owe it to them, we owe it to Democracy and America, to be as informed as possible before accepting a choice which has such a high price for those involved.\n\nSo, see this film... not because it's a masterpiece (it's not: the first half in particular is ham-handed in style) or because it's particularly funny (it isn't, depressingly not at times) or even because of the controversy surrounding it; but because it gives a voice to people like Lila Lipscomb and tens of thousands like her.

1056;276.0;4.0;26.0;I consider myself a conservative independent, even though I'm registered as a Republican.  I went into this movie w/ a fairly open mind.\n\nIt seemed to break out into two major sections.\n\n1.  The pre-Iraq invasion half was strongly anti-Bush, not that that is a cardinal sin.  But it definitely had a strong 'agenda' feel to it.  In this section of the movie, I found myself thinking through lots of counter-arguments and objections to what was presented.  So while there was much evidence presented, it appeared to have too many holes or alternate explanations to be convincing to me.  Intriguing, yes.  Worth considering, yes.  Convincing?  Not quite.  It at least didn't convince me of Bush being any worse than any other Presidential candidate out there.\n\n2.  The second half was more anti-war than it was anti-Bush.  This was far more compelling to me.  I found myself in tears several times over the horror and tragedy of war.  One of the most compelling statements in the movie was something to the effect of, 'Even if you are not a pacifist, war should be a last, last, last option.  And this was not our last option.'  That's a heavy paraphrase, but that was the general idea.  This didn't have NEARLY the political feel the first half had, and had much less of a propaganda feel to it.\n\nBottom Line: Buy the DVD or at least go see the movie.  It's worth thinking through, considering, and talking about regardless of your political affiliation.;A Republican Weighs In . . .
1086;277.0;1.0;26.0;"In all of his films, Michael Moore misleads and even deceives his audiences in order to enhance whatever point he is trying to make, as anyone who takes the time to actually read anything about the man already knows.  Here, he is at his worst, presenting the wildest conspiracy-nut lore as fact without offering one shred of evidence and deliberatly omitting important facts that do not support his attacks on George W. Bush.  And he is so preoccupied with his crusade against the president that he does not even bother to make sure one claim does not contradict one he made five minutes ago.  Nor does he offer any model of how an administration should conduct itself during a war, or explain how he would have handled the fight against terrorists.  If you think Michael Moore loves America, than you might want to consider that a captured terrorist, Qaidar Faisal, quoted text from Moore's book ""Stupid White Men"" during his trial as justification of the jihad against the West.  This kind of blatant propaganda has no place in a democracy, and the fact that so many people embrace it should frighten anyone who loves living in a free country.";Nothing but Propaganda
1087;278.0;1.0;26.0;Regardless of how I feel about anything Moore does, the political situation or anything else that people want to heap on top of tis film, it is the work of a masterful manipulator. The only point I am going to bring up is his film shot in Walter Reed Hospital. He manipulated the film shot there of actual war casualties who had body parts amputated to make it seem that they were against the war. In several interviews post Farenheit 9/11's debut these people in Walter Reed have been disgusted that they were used by Moore to further his own propaganda when they were proud of what they had accomplished over there and would have done it again. Moore is a Manipulator of information and that is all.;Moore the Manipulator
1088;279.0;5.0;26.0;"I wonder if George W. Bush understands the irony:  In large part, the rest of the world's antipathy towards us for our unilateral attack of Iraq is what catapulted Fahrenheit 9/11 to this year's Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, thereby adding to the momentum it got upon its US release.\n\nDoes Moore show some prejudice in presenting the facts and circumstances surrounding our build up to war against Iraq?  Absolutely.  But you know Moore's bias going in.  Does his movie still deserve the label ""documentary""?  Probably.  Despite the ""artistic license"" Moore takes in presenting the facts, the facts are what they are.  Even if you watch this movie with a grain of salt and only believe, say, 50% of what you see, it's still terrible indictment of Bush and his administration.\n\nI remember shortly after 9/11 hearing the story - it was just a vague rumor then - of Bush having sat for a period of time in the classroom where he was reading with an elementary school class even after being told by Andrew Card that ""America is under attack.""  Cynical as I am, I wasn't about to believe that story without proof.  Michael Moore, as sportscaster Warner Wolf would say, ""goes to the video tape,"" and there's Bush, sitting in the classroom for fully seven minutes after being told the country was being attacked.\n\nIt's interesting to me that although Moore presents documented facts in his movies, the conservative response is always to simply shoot the messenger (i.e. Moore hates America, Moore's a fat, stupid white man).  The lack of any reasoned debate about Moore's work is very telling about the inability of his critics to refute the facts in the movie.\n\nMost touching is the story of the woman who lost her son in Iraq.  She'd been a believer, until she lost her son and found out that we'd gone to Iraq under false pretenses in the first place.  I can't imagine her pain.\n\nBush ultimately explained the inexplicable seven minute delay in leaving the classroom by saying that he was ""collecting his thoughts.""  As talk show host Bill Maher has pointed out, that was a helluva time for him to start a new hobby.\n\nSee the movie with an open mind and decide for yourself if this man and his cabal should be running the country for the next four years.";An Immensely Important (Historic?)

But after i heard that some movie called Bowling for Columbine had an interview with Matt Stone from South Park in it (and South Park was my thing) I decided to try it out. Expecting to be super bored I turned it on and I was instantly a Michael Moore fan. I just couldn't believe how well it was done. So of course when I heard this new movie Ferenheit 9/11 was coming out I got really excited but I didn't expect it to be as good as Columbine. But it was actually better! It was so hard-hitting and intense I could barely believe it. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD. This movie really makes me appreciate being Canadian.

None of them felt that there was anything in the movie was not factual. Most of it was video clips!  Straight from the horse's mouth.  Or no words from the horse's mouth (behind?) as in the case of the 7 minutes after the second plane hit the World Trade Center.\nI was amazed at how many obvious news clips were in this movie that have never been broadcast to We The People.  Where is our free press?\nDefinitely see the movie and decide for yourself.  I saw it and I decided it is well worth seeing.

1269;282.0;1.0;26.0;The last thing America needs right now is Michael Moore's garbage! President Bush is the one of the best men to ever lead america! He is a good man who is not some slick lying cheatin fool who betrays his wife. This film is no good and I view it as anti-american and I think Bush is no perfect person either but I don't think that a president deserves a movie like this. Hollywood better get used to it because Bush is going to be re-elected in 2004 and will go another four years and there is no way that pretty boy Edwards and left wing Kerry are going to be elected in. George Bush will be president until 2008 no matter what Michael Moore thinks!;Michael Moore is FULL of it!
1289;283.0;5.0;26.0;"Nanny nanny boo-boo...First off, let's get something straight. While many critics here are hung up on the politics of the film, let's not forget that documentary making is an art-form and should be approached as such.  It is a artistic means to examine a thesis.  During the late-1980's Michael Moore developed a style of presentation of fact that relied on sharply contrasting public relations rhetoric with cold hard fact.  Watch the camerawork as he cuts from pretentious regalia to cold hard fact.  It's like being in a car going 90 mph and then slamming on the brakes.  A devistating effect!\nMoore has not done anything too original since Roger and Me in terms of presentation until now.  The master of the muckracking documentary-style is back with the afterburners on.\n""Bowling for Columbine"" (arguably) did NOT deserve an Oscar (although I'm happy for Moore) because the thesis in ""Coumbine"" is somewhat muddled.  The thesis in F-911, however, is as crystal clear as the thesis in Roger and Me.  Like Roger and Me, on the other hand, the film may not get an Oscar, but you can be damned sure that it will get massive airplay in thousands of college classrooms dedicated to the pursuit of truth in Global Conflict, Sociology, Criminology, Political Science and Documentary making. In F-911 Moore displays skills exhibited by Sociological researchers of the highest order a la C. Wright Mills, who was the first American to point out the intertwined relationships between the upper echelons of: a) military; b) industry; and c) government.\nIn F-911, Moore simply reaffirms his status as a ""Karl Marx for the masses"", in that he examine the nature of power, but in such a colorful way that uneducated persons can actually ""grasp"" some of it.  As Marx predicted, when revelations of these true relationships of power are laid out for these masses, they are shocked into a rude awakening and behave much like a person who is awakened from a deep slumber.  In other words, they are pissed-off because Moore ""woke 'em up"" (to what? To the truth, of course).\nWell, here's another truth: Calling Moore a ""fat slob"" and saying that he should be ""silenced"" does not markedly increase the credibility of his critics.  In fact it reveals them for what they are: small-minded reactionaries.  Also, saying that Moore ""eats too many Dunkin' Donuts"" does not change the fact that the Bushster is squandering about $390 billion dollars a year on the ""War on Terrorism"" while education, hospitalization, space exploration, local law enforcement and social security programs for the elderly and poor are having the life choked out of them.\nIt is also inaccurate to label Moore's work as ""propoganda"" as the term propoganda is defined as an organized scheme for the propogation of doctrine.  By definition, propoganda does NOT acknowledge any ""middle ground"".  In F-911 Moore does examine both sides of the thesis, thus calling F-911 ""propoganda"" is similar to calling Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" an ""anti-drug statement"".  By the way, for all the numbskulls out there who think that they ""could make Hitler look good"" if they twisted the facts enough, you should watch Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"".  The irony here is the remarkable similarities between the type of Nationalist propoganda that Hitler was pushing and the type of colorful Nationalist propoganda that the Bush administration used to fuel its ""war efforts"".\nIf you hated F-911 and you hate Moore, then you must love paying $2 for a gallon of gas and $3.50 for a gallon of milk to feed your kids.  If Dubya steals the vote again in 2004 the US will continue to fight an Orwellian War against enemies that are hidden and globally disbursed.  As Moore implies, prices will continue to rise at the expense of the middle and lower classes.  Industry will have the power to do whatever it wants to America.  (Now, who is our enemy again? I forget.)  Hats off to the first president elected by the supreme court and not the people!";he's not fat, he's just big-boned
1292;284.0;5.0;26.0;"Moore deserves an Academy Award for this incredible documentary, and imagine how Dubya will SQUIRM if he loses in November, and Moore sweeps the Oscars! This film not only opened my eyes, but confirmed my suspicions about why the Hell we were attacking the country of Iraq. There are murderous dictators, and atrocities happening in countries in Africa on a daily basis, as well as our own back yard of Haiti, and drug lords running rampant all over South America, and infiltrating our streets with Crack Cocaine and Smack. But we don't declare war on them, we do nothing, but send our regards. Why, you ask? Well, I can GUARANTEE you that if the country of Haiti had the 2nd largest Oil Reserves on the Planet, that we would have already invaded it, deposed the leader, and stuck a US Flag in the center of the Capital of Port Au Prince, thats for damned sure.\nGeorge Dubya Redneck, the real life J.R. Ewing, and his sidekick Dick Cheney have, shall we say ""business interests"" in all that Black Gold/Texas Tea that Saddam Hussein was sitting on so smugly. Could they and Halliburton get to it with Saddam there? No Way, Jack! BUT, after 9/11 happened, this opened the floodgates, all of a sudden they had all the excuse they needed, the fear of the American People to inexplicalbly declare war on a country that had ZILCHO to do with 9/11. And now, except for those damned insurgents, George Dubya has his foot in the door, and is on the verge of being a billionaire once he hands the reins over to Dick. And if it costs over 1,000 US troops, well, thats just tough, and the Dept. of Defense will send their sympathies and regrets, oh, and they won't forget to dock your precious sons or daughters pay for those last few days when they were in a body bag, after all they only get paid for killing Iraqis, not ""lying down on the job""....This film made me disgusted, especially when they showed US Troops a little too happy about burning down homes. This film made me nauseated when we saw what really went on behind the scenes of the last US Elections, and Bush's Limo getting pelted with eggs says all we need to know about why we need to get that reject from Hee Haw, and send him back to Jerkwater Texas where he belongs.";The Bush Administration EXPOSED!

The idiots that scream ""PROPAGANDA"" or bias simply refuse to believe the evidence of their eyes and ears. I am truly thankful that Michael M0ore has documented the actions of the scum who stole the 2000 election, and the consequences of their warmongering, which did not start in 2001, 2000, but years before in 1996 with the evil of Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, and their ""Project for a New American Century (PNAC).""\nLet the idiots who worship Hannity, Limbaugh, Savage and their ilk beware: the American people WILL eventually rise up and put them in their place as long as there are TRUE Americans like Michael Moore to help remind us of their true evil nature.\nGo see it and WAKE THE HELL UP.";The Truth sets us free, with help from Michael Moore!
378;286.0;5.0;25.0;"First of all, I waited until after the election to purchase this DVD and watch it. From all of the hype, I didn't want a film to determine who I voted for as the next president of the United States of America.  After watching Fahrenheit 9/11 with my entire family, I was saddened before that George W. Bush was in office, but now, I am more saddened that he is.  Moreso, I am disappointed in the American people who truly believe this film has no value to it and who choose to believe this was soley an attempt for Michael Moore to make money.  Maybe it was, or maybe it wasn't.  Who cares?  The fact is, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there's certainly some truth to this story. We as American Citizens owe it to ourselves to know the truth about the individuals who hold the key to this country's future. In addition, we owe it to ourselves to make sure this country is headed in the right direction for our children...their children, etc. Michael Moore did a superb job educating, not pursuading, coaxing or manipulating me into what he wanted me to see, but instead he educated me on what I needed to know as an African American Citizen living in the United States today. I truly thank him for the ""eye opening course"" and I encourage everyone to purchase this DVD for educational purposes as well. It will certainly wake you up. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, Black, White, Hispanic...whatever, we are still Americans who deserve to know the truth about our leaders. I encourage you to open your eyes because there's no doubt we're moving in the wrong direction. Isn't it time that we got back on the right track?  I'd say America is well over due...wouldn't you?  Thanks Mr. Moore for a true lesson in history.";AMERICA, IT'S SIMPLY TIME TO WAKE UP!

When will our fore-fathers' intentions of a seperation between church and state be realized and respected? Read the Bible - Christ was not a war-monger, He was not self-righteous, he was not judgemental. So keep your prayers out of our public schools and your moral values out of our government.

87;288.0;1.0;23.0;The biggest lie in this movie slipped past just about everybody. Michael Moore says in this movie, not a documentary, that we attacked a country that never killed an American.

530;290.0;5.0;25.0;Y'know, I'm tired of the 'you've-got-to-see-the-other-side' reviews that claim that one is being brainwashed because F9/11 doesn't give the right-wing side of the story. From one who's been paying attention to BOTH sides of the issues for the last 4 years I hate to tell you - Mike actually did that.\n\nUnfortunately for Bush apologists, it didn't skirt delicately around or soften the blows of the effects of Bush's policies nor his history. If you're a right-wing conservative and you still need to be coddled, I'm sure William Safire or Sean Hannity or Bob Novak or Anne Coulter or Rush Limbaugh (among many, many others - 'liberal' press my ass) have many comforting platitudes to explain away what's going on right under our noses.\n\nThe notion that Mike only made F9/11 for the money is ludicrous and again a cheap ad hominem attack to try and undermine the film as a whole, rather than take on what it presents. How does this square with his attempts to screen the film for free and the allowance of people to download and distribute it?\n\nBecause bottom line: the facts that Mike brings up in the film are irrefutable - it's the conclusions he draws from them that are questionable - though even then he draws some pretty good conclusions. I do not agree with everything he claims, but F9/11 paints an undeniably frank picture of the corrupt man sitting in the White House after a fraudulent election who has gotten the United States as in over its head as he is. Remember, Bush has lied us into a war where we've murdered civilians and sexually abused prisoners, not to mention the physical and psychological toll the war has taken on the troops we sent there. Seeing F9/11 might help you see how my criticism is not partisan slander.\n\nPeople who've questioned Bush from the beginning remember how we were told we were 'unpatriotic' and were scolded not to criticize the pResident - F9/11 coming out gives us permission to talk about what's happening. And with the numerous attempts to silence the film, that's something it's detractors clearly do not want.;Some of this film is damning in ANY context...

It did contain a morsel of Bush whacking, but that's it.\n\nHere, Michael Moore brought out all the big guns. From Bush's allegedly and dishonestly stolen the electoral votes from Al Gore, to the 9/11 tragedy, the follies of the Patriot Act and culminates in the debacle known as the Iraq War Part 2. Moore gnashes and chews his way to portray Bush as one big dumb Texan cowboy who hides behind his daddy's boots.\n\nPropaganda or not, Moore still present a credible situation in which Bush is absolutely the wrong man for the American presidency.\n\nThe DVD itself is packed with extras.

We can't decide who our political machines choose for us to vote for. We only decide which one of those machines rule. Like it or not,that is a fact!\n\n  Facts are the big issue in this movie. Partisans on both sides of the isle want you to either believe or disbeleive the facts in this movie. There are no special effects in this movie, no Lucas film type computer graphics. In the end you have to believe what you just witnessed is true , or not. plain and simple. If you feel that Moore played fast and loose with his context of the events portrayed, than so be it. But the real fact is this: Our president is the one who distorted the facts. He is the one who broke Iraq. Secretary of state Powell is wrong. The president broke Iraq and WE BOUGHT IT! And the price is so precious! How will we ever pay for those who have been so tragically impacted. Can we ever? The human cost will never be justified. Never.\n\n  If you are a partisan Republican than you will never admit that your precious President could ever have been so tragically wrong.

1265;310.0;5.0;25.0;"More than just a celebration of free speech, Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is something that every young, small town, working class kid should see.  The tactics employed by two marines to get kids to enlist in the military is shocking, but the real highlight of Fahrenheit 9/11 are the revelations of President Bush and his ties to the Bin Laden's and the Saudi Oil partners.  All the bashing of Fahrenheit 9/11 from pro-Bush supporters should appreciate the First Amendment; something that the Bush regime has been trying to supress since he came to office.  Back on topic though, Moore combines footage of Bush as a Florida kindergarten the morning of September 11, 2001, as well as Bush on vacation, which is just about all the time.  From the negative reviews I've read of the film, most of them are from people who haven't even seen the film, and it's a shame.  People should see this, and I recommend taking a pro-Bush supporter with you so they can see just what they're supporting.  Open your eyes America, it's time for a change.";Brilliant and eye opening
1273;311.0;4.0;25.0;"...is the root of all kinds of evil.\nFunny, all the hype about this little documentary. I find it kind of tame. Compared to the fear-mongering, lying, deception, and soulless manipulation of religion that has gone on in the Bush administration, Moore's movie is kind of timid in its presentation.\nThis movie affirms the old maxim that it is impossible to serve two masters. For all of his show in the other direction (playing up hot-button issues like abortion, stem cell research, faith-based ""initiatives"" etc.--all the while doing absolutely nothing about them by the way--***no doubt since he'd rather keep the issue alive to manipulate people with***) George Bush cares little for God or America, unless he can make a profit by them. And profit he has by the blood of America's bravest and by the blaspheming of all that is holy.\nMoore is timid because he only plays up the money aspect. He only soft-touches on how Bush and his cronies have used fear to make ostriches and slaves of the once free American people. He leaves Bush's religious hypocrisy largely untouched.\nLet me begin by noting that Bush has, on a couple of occasions suggested or outright said that Allah is the same God as the God of Jesus Christ. How evangelical Christians--which George Bush claims to be can overlook this is beyond me.\nBut more to the point, how followers of Christ can support a man who has saturated the culture in fear can abide such a leader, and how Moore (also a Christian) did not see this as worthy of tying into his film baffles me. Our God (and even if you are not a Christian but still have a conscience--your ""god"" is a heck of a lot closer to my God than George Bush's demonic conception of a deity) does not give us a Spirit of fear, but of Sonship and Freedom. These are the very things that Bush and his Saudi/Al-queda allies hate.\nWake up people. Moore's film is but the tip of the iceberg. We need only look at the fruits of George Bush, domestically and internationally to know what kind of smiling villain now illegally occupies the White House.\nDespite Moore's soft touch, I recommend this film very highly.";THE LOVE OF MONEY...
1306;312.0;5.0;25.0;"Everybody it seems has an opinion about Michael Moore and be it positive or negative most are not shy about expressing it.  So considering the already entrenched opinions held about the man, any discussion about his work will more than likely follow a predictable path and degenerate into a mud slinging exercise by the usual left and right wing suspects where any reasoned debate gets jumped on and beaten up very quickly.\nFortunately ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not a film that explores the finer points of its subject matter and can be dissected by subtle intellectual debate.  This is a wrecking ball aimed directly at President George W. Bush, his Government, personality, policies, advisers, business associates and even his family.  Moore doesn't hold back and at times his attacks on the president seem more like a personal insult than a critique of his presidency.  But then again can G.W. Bush tell the difference?  Recently, the Washington correspondent for RTE News Carole Coleman was granted a private interview with the president at the Whitehouse.  During the course of the interview Ms Coleman grilled President Bush rigorously yet respectfully about his policies, yet the president seemed to take great offence at this and repeatedly tried to brow beat the interviewer.  When one is dealing with a man who seems incapable of distinguishing between professional disagreement and personal attack, Michael Moore's tactics are not only justified, they are obligatory.\nFahrenheit 9/11 grabs the audience from the beginning and moves from the tragic, to the comic, to the disturbing, to the downright frightening in a way that the viewer can't help but be pulled along with.  As with ""Bowling for Columbine"" Moore doesn't run shy from presenting the viewer with the raw pain of people directly affected by the events he rages at, the journey of Mrs Lila Lipscombe from unquestioning patriotism through doubt to anger is both tragic from a personal point of view and masterful cinema.  I truly ached for this woman's and shared her sense of betrayal, the worst part of it being as the pro war woman outside the Whitehouse said ""You're not the only one"".  Yet for all this, Moore's real anger in this film is reserved for the class divisions in American society and how this is exploited by the ruling elite to further their own agendas.  One young man's comment ""I was looking at the pictures on TV of Baghdad after the bombing and I thought we have places that look like that around here and we haven't had a war"" sums up the decline of society in the US caused by poverty and official indifference that this film rails against.\nThis is not a documentary cast from the traditional mould where the narrator attempts to see things from all perspectives and present the user with a balanced view; this is a film that is very definitely pushing a point of view and as such criticism that the film lacks objectivity misses the point completely.  However the power of the message can't be denied.  Moore is a persuasive character and when one sees the look on Bush's face when he is told that the Nation is under attack on the morning of September 11th, that look of indecision, fear, and almost blind panic is enough to make you wonder just how much intelligence and moral fibre does this man actually have behind the public image and just what what kind of man is leading us.  Thomas Payne once said ""The patriot must always be willing to defend his country against its government"" and by this yardstick Michael Moore may have done our society a great service in making this film.  Whether you agree with the man and his politics or not, you really should see this film. The fact that there are people who are willing to make and distribute a film like this is proof that the freedoms that are our birthright, they are still alive and waiting to be reclaimed.  I can't recommend this film too highly.";A true act of patriotism
1356;313.0;5.0;25.0;I was struck watching this by what a truly talented film maker Moore is... this movie evoked anger, grief and bursts of humor, paced in such a way that lets the audience absorb a great deal of information in two hours. I will probably see it again, simply because there was so much there.

I highly recommend it to everyone, whatever your political philosophy.;Important film

So why is it that we have a couple buildings knocked down, we suffer the same number of casualties that happen on a regular basis every month on our highways, and it completely transforms our country and culture into a profound state of fear and paranoia?  Over 400,000 of our people died in WWII and our population level was about half as it is now.  During the civil war, a whopping 2% of the entire U.S. population died.  How on God's green earth could the deaths of 3000 people, .0012% of our population, shake the foundation of our culture to the point where it's unpatriotic to have a difference of opinion and we adopt a policy of attacking countries for what they ""might"" do?  I've heard historians wonder if 9/11 is the beginning of America's decline in history, like when Rome first fell.  Well let me tell you something -- if we're to the point where a few buildings being knocked down gets us to start back treading on civil rights and reverting to hair-trigger foreign policies, we are going down in a friggin hurry.";The overreaction of 9/11, finally brought to light

But Moore failed to show the rest of the speech and state the environment that Bush made it in. The speech was at a dinner sponsored by the Catholic Church and Gore was in attendance as well.

578;320.0;5.0;24.0;"This movie is the most honest appraisal extant of the administration's gross mishandling of the Iraqi fiasco. It is propaganda, to be sure, but it is honest and sincere propaganda. I have yet to see a credible and factually accurate rebuttal in the legitimate media. There is no need to defend this film; it stands on its own. Truth has a way of emerging from under the pile of right wing feces hurled at it. Time will demonstrate the validity of the claims made in the movie.\n\nKnowing the truth requires more than just listening to the spin of your favorite pundit. I have read over sixty books regarding this administration, both on the left and the right. I vociferously watch all broadcast media, including, but not limited to, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, and the major networks. My conclusions regarding this administration are a result of my analysis based on the evidence available to me.\n\nWhat I have seen from the right wing concerning this film is fear. What are conservatives scared of? It appears that with the absence of the Soviet Union as an adversary, our paranoia has made us fabricate a new enemy. There are 18,000 Al Qaeda terrorists WORLDWIDE, operating on an annual budget of 10 million dollars. Because they are so small, they will occasionally succeed against overwhelming opposition. They WILL attack again. This is a given. However, I am not frightened of my own mortality. If a terrorist kills me, so be it. However, I would be willing to wager my life's earnings against this possibility. To say such a scenario is a remote possibility is an understatement. It is perfectly natural to fear that which you are ignorant of, or challenges your belief system. Truth is scary. To recognize it requires reasoning and an ability to accept ideas that may be contrary to your own. You must have the intelligence and flexibility to be able to modify your point of view if the facts change. Being resolute is functionally useless if you make bad judgements and are not willing to modify your outlook as facts change.\n\nMichael Moore, and the rest of us ""left wingnuts"" were not waiting in the bushes to ambush the president. In fact, we were reluctantly brought into this arena due to the poor judgements, deceptions, and outright lies foisted upon us by an arrogant leader to whom the average American is beneath contempt. Record deficits, a net shrinking of the American workforce, the collapse of our booming economy, and the spread of fear and ignorance; this is George W. Bush's legacy. Tell my daughter as she spends the rest of her life paying off the incredible deficit this charlatan has foisted on our children, and their children. When poor leadership decisions destabilize the world and take away everything you have worked for and believed in, then it becomes your patriotic duty to defend and protect those basic rights that separate Americans from lesser primates. Today, many career professionals have seen their industries crumble through no fault of their own. The administration's answer? Go back to community college. Tell that to people with advanced degrees, whose jobs have migrated overseas. Tell that to any one 50 years old or older. Some of us don't like shopping (or working) at Wal*Mart, or being thrown a bone by our leaders.\n\nRespect of the presidency is not a given; like any public servant, the president must earn the respect of his employer, the people of America. If he is doing a poor job, making bad decisions, using poor judgement, and killing Americans in a war based on premises now conclusively proven by the president's own appointee, Charles Duelfer, to be totally false, then he should be fired. He must show respect to the American people, not arrogance. He must perform to a certain standard. Make no mistake, he is not a king; he works for you, he works for me. We pay his salary, and he must be accountable to us, ALL OF US, not just his base.\n\nThis is why Michael Moore does what he does, and why ""liberal"" America feels as it does. This administration must be torn down if America is to endure; we can do better and we will do better.";Not for people in denial, nor for right wing idealogues.

The sad part is he has totally misrepresented them and has misused his liberty to express his opinion by turning truths into lies.  Anyone who believes this movie obviously does not do their own research and only believes what they hear on tv.  I would hope that people would combat their own ignorance by reading and researching instead of having to wait until they lose their jobs or means of supporting themselves due to a horrible president.

795;323.0;5.0;24.0;This movie is one of the best movies that I have seen in years. Michael Moore has done an excellent job in setting an example for the American people for how to be a true American. In his movie he has provided an excellent synopsis of the numerous books that have come out chronicaling the actions of the Bush White House in Iraq and the War on Terror. Those people that have bashed Mr. Moore for being un-American are some of the most hypocritical people that I have ever heard. Mr. Moore has shown us what a true American is by truly embrasing not only the right, but the obligation, of all Americans to think critically of their government, no matter who is in power, and anybody that critizes him for this should take a good look at their own actions and how those actions would be catagorized by our founding fathers.

Granted, Moore does occasionally go overboard, particularly with his assertions concerning 2000. Nevertheless, Moore hits home on a number of facts and does not mince any words (or images for that matter). He shows the aftermath of the bombing raids on Baghdad and displays the discontent felt by more than a few of our troops in Iraq. In addition to the serious and occasionally disturbing, Moore also injects a bit of humor, particularly with his statement about Bush spending so much time on vacation; his interviews with House members (especially Porter Goss, our new CIA chief); his quest to inform Congress about the Patriot Act via an ice cream truck; and humorous looks at John Ashcroft, Paul wolfowitz (so that's why he's so slick), and of course Dubya himself. Some people may criticize Moore for depicting Bush as in idiot, they forget that Dubya provides most of the ammunition.

1006;331.0;5.0;24.0;"This movie can be viewed from two different perspectives. On a superficial level, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" can be viewed as simply an entertaining movie. On that level, the movie easily scores a 5/5. Moore very skilfully manipulates (and I don't mean this in a negative way) our emotions as film viewers. One moment we find ourselves laughing or shaking our heads bemused by yet another Bush malapropism, the next moment outraged as Moore makes his case that the war was merely a way of finishing off what his father began in 1991 and as a way of enacting what many civil libertarians consider draconian limits on personal freedoms in the name of public safety. For me, the most poignant parts of the movie revolves around a woman from Flint Michigan who's children were serving in the military at the time of the Iraqi war. We watch unfold this mother's progression from a supporter of the President Bush and his war efforts to someone who, after being transformed through  tragedy, wholly rejects the President's case for the war in Iraq.\n\nThe other perspective is from the observer who coldly examines the facts as they are presented. From this perspective, I have to give the movie a 4/5, not because it was not factual, but because Moore really doesn't contribute a great deal new to the story (save the personal stories of some of the people presented in the documentary). For example, I watched a CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company) documentary on ""The Fifth Estate"" which detailed the family connections between the Bush's, Bin Laden's, and the Saudi Royal Family, a full year before ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" arrived in theatres. The same can be said of the BBC expose of the Florida election scandal; the BBC documentary came out only a few months after G.W. Bush became President. Rather, Moore re-packages this information, adds some human interest stories, and skilfully injects humour, to create a very good, though not entirely original in content,  documentary.\n\nDoes this movie have an ideological slant? Certainly, and to expect otherwise would be unrealistic. Does Moore want Bush defeated in the next election? Absolutely, and to his credit he's said as such on numerous occasions. However, I would ask those individuals who have given this film a negative review to do one thing. If you say he's lying, please provide examples, as Mr. Moore has documented his claims. Unfortunately, I have yet to read a negative review which claims Moore is lying in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" to provide evidence to back up this claim.";An impressive effort by Mr. Moore

Dr. Marvin SHouser sums things up well with this hypothetical: suppose there is a forest fire in progress and a conservative and a liberal are sent in to put it out, and given complete discretion in how to do so. the liberal will likely fill a teacup up with water, then run to the fire and throw it on. obviously this will do nothing. the conservative, on the other hand, will build a fire break and sacrifice the portion of the forest already engulfed to save the rest. however, the cameras will film 2 things: the liberal throwing the teacup of water on the fire and the fire going out. the liberal will then claim that what he did put out the fire, even though it did nothing. he will even go so far as to accuse the conservative of doing nothing to help. some even go so far the delude THEMSELVES into believing what they did worked! it the world of the liberal, appearance is all that matters, and if you dig down past the top layer, you get slammed with PC nonsense. this film in comparison to celsius 41.11 is THE prime example of this. Celsius was criticized for being too right wing and not entertaining enough. the first words in celsius is ""we begin with the premise that john kerry is an honroable man"" and all the speakers maintain a professional repsect for the opposition. the closest anyone comes to breaking that is Medved, who says in regard to bush's statement that we need to fight terrorism by doing something other than turning the other cheek by saying, ""Bush understands this. THe other side does not"". but even that maintains a professional respect. Celsius is a REAL documentary-created to inform, not entertain. it gives a factual breakdown of current political issues and the 00 and 04 elections. farenheit, on the other hand, features a bunch of clips that moore twisted completely out of context, and mixed in is rhetorical nonsense from moore himself. There is not ONE solid fact in this film. there's just a lot circumstantial stuff that even most liberals would dismiss if moore showed the whole picture. we've actually fallen so far as a country and become so pathetic that we ignore real facts and instead believe a guy driving around DC in a golf cart reading the patriot act over a megaphone. no wonder people were avoiding him-they thought he was retarded! but hey, it's PC, so people will actually believe this. open your eyes to moore's films and other liberal arguments and propaganda. there's no logic or facts to any of it, just a bunch of PC hyperbole that we've been turning into law and social policy for the last 80 years or so.";Typical liberal trash

Moore states his case and defends his points well - given some exaggerations, shenanigans and downright funny footage.\nIf there is one thing that Michael Moore is not, it is objective. He doesn't pretend to be. ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is his indictment of what he sees to be the Bush Administration's crimes and misdemeanors. Moore contends that the president and cohorts are forcing their policies on the American people, and the international community, with few qualms about truth or consequences. He lambastes Bush's Middle East policies pre and post 9/11 with skillful use of film footage, interviews, statistics, quotes and an ironic narrative. Granted, he cuts (splices) and pastes freely, at times, to make his points, and their are some leaps of logic...but his facts are...well, factual. On the other hand the ""fair & balanced"" news media in the US is not objective either. The film contains some impressive footage of ""shock and awe"" from the Iraqi perspective, on the ground, that Americans never got to see. I remember ""shock & awe."" US TV played it 24/7 and many people I know said it didn't look all that impressive - from the air. Moore shows the same footage of the tremendous bomb blasts from the ground in Iraq. He shows the footage played on al Jazeera, but not on the US major networks - of Iraqi civilians, women, children, babies, blown to bits because of phony information - information selectively fed & hyped to the American people by our government. We see and hear interviews with traumatized, innocent Iraqi civilians. He shows our soldiers, dead or terribly wounded, and listen to excerpts from highly emotional interviews with their bereaved parents. US troops who are disillusioned with the war are interviewed also. No, Moore does not give equal time to interviews with the many soldiers who believe in the US mission - but, intelligent audiences will have to balance the film's content for themselves and use their common sense to provide what Moore does not. We do this all the time when we watch 30 second spots on TV news.\nMoore takes us from the debacle of the 2000 presidential elections to our preemptive strike on Iraq and the present conflict. His portrayal of 9/11 and the tragedy at the World Trade Center is one of the most poignant and tasteful I have seen. Information from Craig Unger's best-selling book ""House of Bush, House of Saud"" is covered and documented. The social and financial connections between the Saudi Royal family and the Bush family are very disturbing, as are their ties to the bin Ladin family. What is even more disturbing is the estimated $1.4 billion that the Bush's and their close colleagues have made from the association. Among other favors in return for favors - the Bush Administration rewarded Saudi and Texas supporters with billions of dollars in Iraqi reconstruction contracts. And then there's Halliburton. And the Taliban officials who received the royal treatment when they visited the US, just prior to 9/11, to discuss building a pipeline which would carry vast gas and oil deposits from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. As the president of an American armored vehicle company says at one point, the Iraqi War is ""good for business, bad for the people"" - the Iraqi and American people, that is.\nA few years ago, Michael Moore spoke with then-Governor George W. Bush, who told him to: ""Behave yourself, will ya? Go find real work."" Well, Moore did and this is the result. Whether you like Moore's work or hate him - I am thankful that there are people like him, willing to do the research, share a perspective and risk censure. I thank him for his film. Please see it if you haven't done so yet.\nJANA";Excellent, Informative & Not For Everyone!
1314;338.0;5.0;24.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 was my introduction to the works of Michael Moore - and what an introduction at that!  I was a little hesitant to attend the movie at first, thinking Moore's documentary would be simply preaching to the choir.  After all, I find most of us are completely divided down the middle - we are either supporting the war and its ideals OR are completely against it.  I've met very people who are truly lost in between.  But after 2 hours, I was convinced that Fahrenheit 9/11 is an essential American movie right now and plainly delivers some hard facts that the White House has censored since Bush's inauguration.\nMichael Moore makes the ideal narrator, able to describe countless layers of information in plain English.  Personally, I've found myself dumbfounded with countless articles and news reports that are constantly delivering conflicting information.  Moore plainly goes through each layer of deceit, without fully stepping into conspiracy theories.  Though many extremists would like us to believe that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were completely staged by the government, Moore doesn't fall into that category.  He shows us how plainly September 11th was the product of Bush's negligence.\nMoore's documentary succeeds in putting raw facts out in the public eye and showing how each of them (while alone seem insignificant) result in a chain reaction.  Someone who has never followed politics can see step-by-step how an election could have been ""fixed"" and how statements by the White House officials have changed in a moments notice.  As Moore points out, one minute we're told to be on high-terrorist alert and to take all necessary precautions and the very next message is for us to go about our normal lives and still patronize restaurants and shopping centers without any fear.  *Sigh*  One thing, I found most disturbing was seeing how connected the Bush family is with the Bin Laden family.  Again, Moore doesn't try and point out a conspiracy theory here, but when the Bush Jr., Bush Sr. and many of their colleagues are making millions of dollars in profits because of this business relationship, it kind of makes you wonder why the all the Saudi Arabians were allowed to leave the country without be questioned.  An interview with one of the people involved int he Sept. 11th investigations even said, we were not there to point the fingers or make arrests, but its common practice to interrogate family members and friends of a suspect (i.e. Osama Bin Laden).\nOne of the hardest moments are sneak peaks into the war.  Actual testimonies from American soliders and their parents, including snippets of personal letters from Iraq that are usually censored before they even reach the families at home.  But don't be mistaken, the movie doesn't argue against all war, but directly shows how this one was mishandled and was used to protect the Bush Family's personal investments over the lives of every-day Americans.\nI'll be honest, I don't agree with every detail in Fahrenheit 9/11, but as a whole, there's a lot of truth that has escaped the public's attention.  The true message of the movie is: we have been fooled, lied to, used and abused by a very strong network of political figures and greedy corporate heads.  We can't undo what has already been done, but we can prevent this from happening again!\nGive Michael Moore a try - if anything, you'll see a whole new side to an already messy situation.  In troubled times, we need all the information we can get to make the right decisions.  Well, take it right from the skeptic's mouth, this movie has got a lot of really important information.";Revealing the Layers of Deceit
1336;339.0;5.0;24.0;"Michael Moore knocks down nine out of ten pins for the thought-provoking, humorous, and ultimately disturbing Fahrenheit 9/11, a title influenced from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the temperature at which books burn.  Well, this documentary is more a critique of the Bush presidency, beginning as it does with a prologue where Al Gore is poised to become the 43rd president, only to have victory snatched from him in Florida, and how Dubya became the winner of the most contested election since 1876.  What adds salt in the wound is how a series of minority representatives protested the ratification of Bush's election, only to be told to shut up by the president of the Senate, Gore himself!\nIndeed, what kind of president is one who when told of the World Trade Center, simply sits there for seven minutes reading My Pet Goat at a Florida elementary school?  Baaaa!  Or who says blatantly that is really helps having a father who's US president?  But what Moore presents is the dissonance between intelligence reports pre- and post-9/11.  In the former, a former acting FBI director tells a committee that Attorney General John Ashcroft did not want to hear anything about terrorist reports.  Saddam Hussein is also not considered a serious threat by National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.  And afterwards?\nThe GOP has been criticized for standing for Gas Oil and Petroleum, and Moore's showing the Bush family and the Saudi oil elite conjoined at the hip gives credence to that acronym.  Others tied in oil companies include Hamid Karzai, who became Afghanistan's first post-Taliban leader, formerly associated with Unocal 76,  Dick Cheney, ex-CEO of Halliburton, but there are others Moore has omitted.\nAs for the effects in this country, much is made of the Fresno for Peace group, who had their group infiltrated, but he doesn't adequately cover the ramifications of the PATRIOT Act enough.  What comes clear from Representative John McDermott (D-WA) is how fear (the red, orange alerts) and uncertainty is used to control people.  In one clip, Bush jokes how a dictatorship would be easier!!!!!!\nMoore's use of pop songs as backing for certain scenes range from hilarious to chilling.  An example of the latter is Papa Bush smiling and exchanges greetings with the Saudi sheiks, when R.E.M. and Kate Pierson chime in with ""Shiny Happy People,"" or the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" in scenes of Junior on vacation in Texas.  Anger-inducing is the Playstation/XBOX mentality the young soldiers in tanks have, requiring a song mirroring the situation while in Iraq made me angry.  Examples:  Drowning Pool's ""Let The Bodies Hit The Floor"" and the Bloodhound Gang's ""Fire Water Burn,"" with key lyrics ""we don't need no water let the mf burn.""\nWhich leads to the conduct of the war in Iraq.  The Iraqi people never committed acts of terrorism against Americans, and yet the civilians are the casualties in a war supposed to liberate them.  One angry and grieving Iraqi woman says there has been five funerals because of the bombing.  Indeed, Moore's narration uses the word ""invaded"" in regards to Iraq.  The footage of burned and injured Iraqis is disturbing and horrific.  Yet the onset of attacks against US soldiers lead the soldiers to wonder what they are doing here, clueless to the fact that the Iraqi civilians didn't ask for them.  One Corporal Henderson, he is willing to risk prison rather than return, and even helps Moore trying to persuade Congressmen to get their children to serve in Iraq.\nWhich leads to the rich/poor division in this country.  As in Vietnam and Desert Storm, it's the minorities in decrepit neighbourhoods like Moore's own Flint, Michigan that end up serving.  But disturbing effects are the Marine Mutt and Jeff pair who recruit African-American youth using a slick business-like sales pitch, and the amputees who have been abandoned due to Dubya's cutting veteran's benefits.  And who is benefiting from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq?  The American people or the oil companies?  As Bush says in one fundraiser, ""They call you the elite.  I call you my base.""\nI expected something controversial along the lines of Thierry Meyssan's L'Effroyable Imposture, but the fact that it wasn't tells how Moore was eschewing something inflammatory and wanted to present something that he wanted everyone to watch, and to reawaken moral and political consciences, for his base.";The degree at which truth burns and conscience awakens!
1360;340.0;3.0;24.0;"The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines propaganda as, ""ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause.""  Fahrenheit 9/11 most definitely fits the description of propaganda.  To Michael Moore's credit, he's been honest about his film having a bias and anyone with common sense would know this going in.\nMoore starts out with a recap of the Presidential election.  Among allegations of vote tampering, Moore cites ""numerous independent publications"" that claim Gore would have won had a recount been allowed in Florida.  Now, wait a second.  Just who are these ""independent publications?""  In the movie, Moore quickly scans over a few newspaper clippings but never elaborates.  In April of 2001, the Miami Herald and USA Today reported that, had a recount been allowed, Bush still would have won; in fact his margin would have widened.  A separate independent study done by the University of Chicago and financed by media giants such as the Associated Press, NY Times, CNN, and LA Times, (not exactly bastions of conservative reporting), came up with the same conclusion.\nMoore then jumps to the Senate hearing, presided by none other than Al Gore, to officially anoint Bush as the next President of the United States.  Election code states that in order for an objection to become official, a member of the House of Representatives needs to have their objection signed by just one Senate member.  One by one, house democrats parade their way up to the Senate floor to voice their objections, yet none were signed by a senator.  My question is -- why?  Where was Barbara Boxer during all this?  Where was Ted Kennedy?  Where were the democrats when they really needed them?\nThis is one problem I have with Moore, and his movies in general.  It becomes very difficult to trust anything Moore says because he ignores the questions that don't support his agenda.  Watch the above segment carefully and you'll also see how Moore twists everything so that the hearing appears to be an attack directed specifically against African-Americans.  Moore also refuses to, as the old saying goes, ""let the facts get in the way of a good story.""\nAnother example:  At the beginning and end of the movie, Moore holds up a copy of Bush's military records with the name James R. Bath blacked out.  Because Bath later managed money for the Bin Ladens, Moore insinuates that censoring his name is a kind of ""smoking gun"" that ties the Bush family to the Bin Ladens.  Perhaps, but that's kind of a stretch.  A more plausible and logical explanation could simply be that it was Bush's military records that were being investigated; not Bath's.\nThat's not to say there isn't a lot to chew on in this picture.  Moore goes into great length to explain a possible tie-in between the Saudi Royal family and the Bush family.  From Bush Jr. being bailed out of his failed oil ventures by angel investors (James Bath via the Saudis) to Bush Sr. being on the board of The Carlyle Group (a large defense contractor and military arms dealer), Moore's claim that the Saudi investment of $1.4 billion dollars in the Bush family, their friends, and related business is enough to make one pause.  Considering the Saudis control 6-7% of the investments in the U.S., perhaps we should change our labels to, ""Made in America (but financed by Saudi Arabia.)""\nContinuing down the money trail, let's talk about Dick Cheney's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee prior to 9/11.  ""You've directed me to buy the V-22, a program I don't need.  You've directed me to buy more M1's, F-14's, and F-16's... Congress has directed me to spend money on all kinds of things that are not related to defense, but mostly related to politics back home.""  Forget $1.4 billion dollars.  At a cost estimated at almost $1.4 trillion (with a `t') dollars over the next five years, money that could have been spent on democrat-favored programs like education and public infrastructure was instead spent on weapons the Pentagon never requested and didn't even want.  And who was President during this time?  Oh yeah, President Clinton.  And who controlled the purse-strings?  Oh that's right, a democrat-controlled Congress.  I guess that's why this footage never made it into the picture.\nThis is the other problem I have with Fahrenheit 9/11.  In Moore's mind, or at least in this movie, George W. Bush is the root of all evil, and anything not meeting his criteria is left out.  Now maybe Bush did sell his soul to the Saudis for a billion dollars and the solution to the world's woes it to throw the bum out.  Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest these same problems were going on long before Bush took office, or that anything will change for the better if this is done.\nI recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 for the issues it raises and the discussions it will generate, but its undeniably slanted viewpoint diminishes its persuasiveness.  It's a powerful movie, and its coverage of the Iraq war, the soldiers serving in Iraq, and parents of soldiers is truly heart-wrenching.  This is where the movie excels.  I just can't give the movie five stars because I left the theater feeling as if I needed to verify every allegation Moore makes, and it disturbs me that some people have bought into the anti-Bush rhetoric hook, line, and sinker.\nNot long ago, Canadian television aired an investigative report which claimed the moon landing was an elaborate hoax filmed by the late Stanley Kubrick.  Containing actual testimony from Kubrick's wife, as well as interviews of astronauts, scientists and even leaders like Henry Kissinger and Donald Rumsfeld, this ""mockumentary"" showed how easily images and media could be manipulated to deceive viewers in order to sell a particular viewpoint.  The same can be said about Fahrenheit 9/11.";Bowling for Bush in 2004
1382;341.0;5.0;24.0;"I am not a particular fan of Michael Moore, finding him often just too self-righteous for my liking. I must say, however, that I have new respect for him, having seen this movie. I accept that some of the footage may be taken out of context; certainly a great deal of it isn't. I have seen enough television in the past two years or so to know that. Some of the criticism about the movie is just wrong. For instance, I recently saw a film critic complaining about the scene where Moore approaches members of Congress to ask them why their children do not volunteer to go to Iraq. Specifically the critic said that these scenes were disingenuous, since members of congress cannot volunteer their children for military duty even if they wanted to. That is not what Moore says at all. He asks the members of Congress he approaches to ""try"" to get their children to volunteer, something totally different. It is not even debatable that the children of members of the U. S. Congress and Senate, at least most of them, never see military duty and that this war is being fought by men and women of color and sons and daughters of poor and middle-class white famililes-- while our president urges the rest of us to go shopping. Or in his case, he shoots another round of golf.\nSome of this footage will make your laugh, some scenes will make your cry, much of this movie will make you very angry. And sad. And frightened.\nWhy was Ashcroft sworn in on a stack of three Bibles, I ask. And who were the people that Bush was speaking to at a black tie event, when he said something to the effect that he was talking to the ""haves"" and ""have mores""? It brought a big laugh from his audience but not the theatre audience.\nI suspect that 99% of the people who see this film already know who they are voting for in November. But at least movies like this one are in some small measure an antidote to the poison that spews daily from talk radio.";This Movie Cannot Be All Propaganda
1407;342.0;5.0;24.0;People who have not seen the movie continue to dispute insignificant talking points and personal attacks.  I have yet to hear a cogent arguement against the material contained within the film itself.  People will continue to distribute articles designed to keep people from seeing the film while at the same time, people who have actually seen it will continue to read them knowing full-well that they are bogus and are rooted in a fear that Moore may be on to something.  I found the film far more unbiased than I expected.  The film is closer to the Green party than the Democratic party.  The movie points the camera directly at the Democrats at times showing them as weak and spineless.  We watch Al Gore cower as he ratifies the 2000 election while 10 different members of the House beg for a Senator (which Gore is, as President of the Senate) to allow them to vioce an objection to the results.  Those who have not seen the film do not understand that the movie is mostly about the state of America today, the unfortunate state that we find ourselves in, and how we got here (and by proxy, who got us here).

Watch a few episodes of his TV show ""The Awful Truth"" for evidence of this fact.  I feel so bad for all the low-level secretaries who have to put up with this sarcastic, brash buffoon who bursts in with a camera crew and no appointment to make trouble.\n\nThat being said, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Moore's strongest film, largely because it keeps Moore out of it.  The sort of aggressive grandstanding that has both made Moore famous and also most hurt his credibility is kept to a minimum here.  Even when he does, for example, take an ice cream truck around the Capitol to read the US PATRIOT Act over a loud speaker (yeah!  that'll change the world!), somebody made the very intelligent decision to cut away quickly.  Yes, he still pulls some of the same old stunts, but, unlike films like ""Bowling for Columbine,"" these are not the bulk of the film, but rather more like a signature:  could you call it a Michael Moore if there wasn't at least a bit of that?\n\nIt's been said that this is a film you should see regardless of your political views, and I agree with that.  When I watched the film, I had the thought several times that somebody was standing behind Moore with a cattle prod, ready to zap him if he didn't keep his tone on the voice-overs in check.  This restraint is what earns Moore the right, in my opinion, to at least be heard.  You know it's a passionate issue for Moore if he's willing to restrain himself so that more people will listen.\n\nIn the end, it's a film worth seeing and you might as well see it now, because it has the shelf life of deli ham.  If you really want to own it, wait a few months and it should be in bargain bins.  This is one of the reason that this should never be considered for Best Picture, as Moore has been campaigning for.  This isn't a film--it's an argument.  So, while it's not remotely Best Picture material, and its value is only so immediate (hence its quick move to DVD), see it.

In the patriotic zeal of the war coverage, Americans were only shown images of victory and good overcomes evil. Michael Moore shows the personal devastation on both sides. From Lila Lipscomb, a proud military mom, who lost her son in the war to the streets of Iraq where shell shocked parents carry their mortally wounded children in search of medical care. In light of the current information that Iraq was not responsible for 9/11, had no WMDs and was at least a decade away from reconstituting a formidable weapons program makes this even more tragic. The fact that our current administration still contends it would have done ""exactly the same thing"" underscores the need to vote these guys out of the White House on November 2.

782;355.0;4.0;23.0;"Michael Moore's magnum opus ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" has become the de facto anthem of, in particular, anyone anti-Bush, and in general, liberals everywhere.  This is for good reason.  Just as the 9/11 attack was a wake-up call to the American people towards the threat of terrorism, Moore's scathing indictment of the Bush Administration is a wake-up call towards the threat of America's own current government.\n\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" seems to be neatly broken down into two ""acts"".  In the first act, Moore weaves a scenario of political intrigue, conspiracies, and cloak-and-dagger what-ifs.  He makes some indisputably disturbing points; for example, why was the Patriot Act printed in the middle of the night, and voted on in the morning, effectively preventing any congresspeople from reading it?  However, I don't give Moore 5 stars, because I honestly found the first half of the film/documentary/political statement to be somewhat convoluted and difficult to follow.  Moore's soft, difficult-to-hear voice does not help.  The ""conspiracy theory"" involving the Bushes' connexion with the Bin Laden family and the Saudis seem a bit speculative and circumstantial, although they do make you think.\n\nThat said, there is nothing short of genius in the second half of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", which begins after Bush launches the Iraq war.  There is nothing confusing or speculative about the inhuman atrocities suffered by the Iraqi people.  There is nothing confusing about the Iraqi father carrying the mutilated corpse of his young daughter.  There is nothing confusing about the American mother Mrs. Lipscomb's inconsolable grief over the loss of her irreplaceable son to the war.  Lipscomb's journey from being a steadfast conservative to her ultimate disillusionment and complete loss of faith in the current administration is both sobering and heartbreaking to watch.  And there is, last of all, nothing confusing that both sides are dying for the greed and evil of one unjust administration.  Really sit down and think, ""why are we fighting this war?""  None of the 9/11 terrorists had any connexions with Iraq.  There are no WMDs in Iraq.  But there is oil.  And now there ARE terrorists in Iraq; we have become the terrorists.\n\nMoore's command of the mood and tone of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is masterful.  He begins with the feature with his characteristic brand of hilarious, scathing social commentary.  However, the tone of the documentary gradually and imperceptably becomes increasing somber in tone.  The ending is overwhelmingly poignant and powerful, leaving nary a dry eye in the house.  Moore brilliantly ends with this statement (not verbatum, from my memory):  ""Our brave fighting men and women sacrifice themselves to defend our freedom, so that we don't have to.  And all they ask for return is that we never send them into harm's way unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.  Can they ever trust us again?""  On behalf of the American people, I apologise to our brave soldiers dying for an unjust and pointless war.  I apologise to the Iraqi civilians for our rape of their country.

Leaving the theater I really felt that love of country one gets when reading the words of Lincoln, seeing the Mississippi for the first time or recalling the sacrifices at Normandy. What really amazed me was hearing two commentators on local talk radio actually encourage the U.S. government to arrest Michael Moore for treason.  I think that is the real lesson of this movie.

""Dissent"" is being turned into a dirty word just like ""liberal"" was turned into a perjorative.\n\nSee this movie America and then vote to restore our tarnished reputation among the family of nations.

936;358.0;1.0;23.0;If there was a way to give less than one star, I would.  The information given within this film is very onesided and biased.  It is also just a little piece of the whole story.  If you believe everything you see in the news, in print and in movies, such as this one, you are very poorly informed.  If you are really interested, look into things more deeply and find the pieces of information that are true while throwing the rest out.  Most of this film could just be thrown out.  I see the things that have happened, and are happing, over here on a daily basis for the past 3 years and things are just not as the media and Michael Moore show.  In the end it is all about making money and controversy is one of the easiest ways to do this.  In this point, Michael Moore did a great job, he made a lot of money using complete fallacy and personal bias.;entertaining, but worthless

973;362.0;4.0;23.0;"Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a ""fictitious President"" who was leading us to a ""fictitious war"", he has fast become a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will depend far less on the quality of the filmmaking (which by the way, is excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election. Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign. He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has become far less didactic than he was with ""Roger and Me"" or even ""Bowling for Columbine"". Instead, he has become an almost subtle alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.\n\nMercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election. This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S. troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib).  Finally, Moore does bring the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in Iraq, noting: ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" It is probably the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.\n\nWhat resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly perturbed Bush reads ""The Pet Goat"" in front of a Florida kindergarten class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S. Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach that kind of logic.\n\nMoore has grown significantly since ""Roger and Me"" in 1989 and not just around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts, figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly, but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film, then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden ""Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry"" and see which one you find least objectionable to lead the country.";Master Provocateur Ups His Game, Reaps Dividends
978;363.0;5.0;23.0;I am amazed by the number of people who claim to have seen this movie and gave it a single star.  Many of their statements are just not true.  Moore does not attack veterans he shows them in many lights most are just like the guy next door.  In fact Moore does not show any distaste for anyone serving in the military, he just points how some of the leaders of this country have failed them.\n\nThis movie is not vile or mean spirited though at times it is very very sad.  I urge you to not take anyone's word about this movie just see it for yourself.  After seeing this movie I did do some fact checking and was surprised it was so accurate.

The almost heretical episode of getting the Bin Laden family out of America after 9-11 - -Etc Etc Etc.\n\nI was genuinely moved by this movie... No amount of propaganda by the Bill Oreiley's or the Rush Limbaugh's can change that. I guess what moved me the most was the realization that many of our basic freedoms are being challenged - yes by terrorists - but also by the Bush administration. We are starting to reach a world of double think with Big Brother watching our liberties and  anyone who criticizes our government is unpatriotic...How untrue and How sad and How saddened our founding fathers would be to see the state we have come to...and yet one of the upifting messages was the fact that there are still genuine working class stiffs like Michael Moore (ok he's a little richer than he used to be), who have the big brass ones to show the facts as they really are.

He has managed to keep the flames burning with ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  In so doing, he has earned the ire of America's right.\n\nMoore has a wonderful discursive style of documentary making where seemingly complex issues are reduced to their basic building blocks.  Other documentary makers could do worse than emulate Moore's style.  However, there are undoubtedly occasions when he oversteps the mark.  For example, he gives the impression that America's Oregon coast is guarded by one state trooper.  This is clearly absurd but an impression is, nonetheless, passed off as fact.  Moore should take care with all his facts.\n\nIt is now widely understood that there is no real connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime in Iraq.  George Bush and his supporters will, in due course, face the wrath of the electorate.  Moore simply points out facts that some choose to ignore.  This is democracy working in spite of the efforts of Messrs Bush, Blair and co.\n\nIt is not clear how the mess in Iraq will be resolved.

1168;373.0;5.0;23.0;"It opens up semi-quietly, showing Al and Tipper Gore celebrating a ""Florida Victory"" after the 2000 election with a huge crowd of supporters. We don't really hear them cheering and having a great ol' time, though. Instead, we hear director Moore lamenting about how the last four years have seemed like a big dream and to many of us in the audience who were ready to see this movie, it does indeed feel that way. I still remember George W. Bush making promises and proclaiming that he would ""be a uniter and not a divider"". He also said he would bring dignity back to the White House...\n\n You can call this film a ""tired liberal argument"", a ""liberal soapbox"", or anything else that comes to mind, but you would be wrong on just about every front. Michael Moore may be a liberal, but he didn't say that liberals have the solution to everything. His interviewee's say that and some of the war-injured say that and the mother whose son was killed over the current struggle in Iraq say that. Moore's whole idea is to say that the man we have serving us in the White House is NOT the man for the job. For this, I applaud Moore and I call him a braver man than I. He hangs not just his private parts out there but his entire body.\n\n Michael Moore's documentary makes intelligent connections between the Bush White House and Saudi oil interests which include the Bin Laden family. He claims that one of Cheney's companies made a profit off of 9/11 due to new war contracts. He shows us that the war in Iraq is both unneccessary and quite deadly mainly because Saddam Hussein has nothing to do with 9/11 and never had the tools that terrorists would love to get their hands on (the famed ""WMD's"" that have become a household name).\n\n Of course, none of this will come as unfamiliar news since we have all heard the crazy things viewers have said about Moore and his ability to ""stretch and distort"" certain truths. Here, I've seen Moore do nothing other than what any other documentary filmmaker would do: persuade you to believe his viewpoint by shooting archival facts your way and showing you why you should care about it now. He has the right, as an American, to question his government. Everyone (even the Repub's) exercised this right not once(in 1992), not twice(in 1996), but THREE TIMES (in 2000). We do so everytime we vote. You will probably do it again in 2004 when you choose your leader for the next four years.\n\n What Michael Moore does NOT do is exactly what Pro-Bush sheep say he and most liberals do: Michael Moore does not hate our military. He does not use 9/11 to his advantage or to any other advantage. He follows the military on their exploits with curiosity and then questions why they continue to fight a war that doesn't need to be fought when the MILITARY begins to complain to the camera. Moore also meets a nice woman named Linda Lipscomb who works in the Unemployment Office in Flint, Michigan, the subject of Moore's very first movie. Her son has gone to war in Iraq and she supports him and the reason the troops fight all the way. She even confesses that she misunderstood the anti-war protesters, saying that she considered their protests as ""a slap in the face"" until she realized that they were protesting the reason Bush led us in there.\n\n Later in the film, we discover that her son was killed in Karballah in a Blackhawk helicopter downed by enemy fire. She no longer supports the war or Bush and her and Moore take a march up to the White House which is almost cast as a big, powerful building that taunts its opponents. It's been fenced off completely (due to construction) so nobody can even approach the gates and that's when Linda's emotions begin to get the best of her as she sobs uncontrollably, remembering her son, doubling over in an almost painful way. This brought tears to the eyes of many an audience member, including me. Not because I don't like the war but because you realize that actual human beings are needlessly dying.\n\n Moore also does NOT sympathize with terrorists. He wisely does not show what we have already witnessed hundreds of times: the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. Instead, he lets us HEAR it with just a dark screen to keep us company. He points out that over 3,000 people, even a friend of his was killed in the attacks. He points out that Bush rightly sent troops to into Afghanistan to ""smoke 'em out"" (repeated over and over by Bush in a cleverly-edited sequence) but that he sent only a mere 11,000 troops. This is incredibly alarming since, a) Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban are supposedly still alive and well in Afghanistan and b) just under 1,000,000 troops are in Iraq, fighting seemingly multiplying insurgent forces everyday.\n\n Michael Moore's film takes you on an emotional journey that will force you to laugh, make you cry, and encourage you to get mad and do something about the sad state of affairs in this country. This, despite what others will no doubt say, is a very important film and one of immense patriotic passion and such power that you might find that you've made an impression of yourself in your theater seat by the movie's end.\n\n **** out of ****\n\n --Matt\n\n (Note: There are two sides to every story. Many call Moore a liar. The National Review's Dave Kopel has written an article apparently showing the ""deceits"" in the film (59 of them, he claims) but Kopel does not often address the heavier claims made by Moore's film and hits on the minor ones. Because of that, it would be easy to call Kopel ""deceitful"" and ""manipulative"" as well.)";Bowling for Bush
1218;374.0;5.0;23.0;Michael Moore is, of course, a childish, smirking mudslinger who can make anybody he interviews look really, really bad through clever editing, and obviously enjoys doing it.  But he stands for good things, and he is not, as he's been labeled, a hypocrite, a hater of America, or even that much of a liar.  He sincerely believes that this country's citizens, whether or not they are Democrats, will be in serious trouble if Dubya is re-elected, and rather than being a piece of propaganda, Fahrenheit 911 is his attempt to show us that our president is a very greedy and dangerous man who is quite indifferent to just about everybody but himself and the people who make him and his buddies lots of money.  If this is true, shouldn't every American know it?\n\nNow, on the subject of Moore's alleged lies, footage is footage, and documents are documents, and he uses lots of both in the movie.  One of the most effective moments, which will leave conservatives gaping in frustration, is when he shows, a few months before the 911 attacks, footage of Bush, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, and the rest of the Bush buttkissers saying, in very smug and self-assured voices, that Saddam Hussein has no WMDs and has no means of acquiring WMDs.  He then shows all of these people, a month after the attack, saying the exact opposite in that same smug tone of voice, proving his point that the invasion of Iraq really had nothing to do with 911 whatsoever.\n\nWatch this film, liberal or conservative.  Some of it can be argued with, some of it can't.  What Bushies conveniently leave out in their attacks on Moore is what can't be countered because it is footage.;Moore does it again
1225;375.0;5.0;23.0;I can't really describe in words what I have in mind right now after seeing this beautiful documentary by Michael Moore. I find it very brave for a filmmaker to go and do such a good job in a documentary that might cost them their own life in a country that claims having freedom above all. I also find it great how Moore manages and expresses his own point of view, while others criticize him for having one. I guess many people cannot handle the truth especially now days. Many of those who criticize this filmmaker's point of view should consider thinking about this movie with an open mind. Just focus on the subject and forget how much you agree or disagree with Moore. How about this film as a documentary? Is it good? Is it bad? So how bad is it? Actually I might disagree about some of the points raised by this movie but that's deep inside my head and it was meant to be raised. You're free to think. It's actually much better if we do think. And to tell you the truth, my life was shocked few hours ago and this shock still affecting me.\nIgnoring the technical details in my review for now and focusing on the emotional side I got. This documentary kept me interested minute by minute and second by second. I loved the way music was used. I also noticed something else about me there in the dark room (cinema theatre that is), and what I noticed was being touched as a human much more than focusing on the technical stuff as an amateur movie critic. I guess the beauty about Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) is that it was meant to make us think, feel, raise questions, and mostly know (or get closer to) the truth in a positive way that might change your life.\nSometimes it is political and sometimes comic. It's even sentimental few times, but thought provoking after all and trying to stay as close to the absolute real truth as possible. Reminded me of Oliver Stone's daring, brave, great masterpiece that is JFK (1991) in many ways. I note here that both of them had great masterwork of editing using materials which we all surely saw on TV here or there and it involves conspiracy too.\nIn short: Important piece of work that needs to be seen by everybody;Important film that shocked me to the bone and needs to be s

Maybe for time constraints or because he was appealing to a larger audience, but there is much more of the story to be told.\nI would hope that every American citizen that makes less than the top 5% of income (that is most of you reading this) to watch this film.\nI implore EVERYONE who can to vote in this upcoming and all elections.

And by the end it was to this viewer an unqualified masterpiece.\nHe goes to great length to make it abundantly clear that all Americans should and do support our troops, even if we don't support this war. He effectively illustrates the horror of which they've been thrust into, and the futility of what they're up against. Only one child of the entire Congress of the United States of America is actually over there in Irag fighting. The look on the congressmen's faces of which he was interviewing when he asked if they would be willing to enlist their children in this war to show their support was priceless and telling.\nHe goes on to fill this canvas with such shocking persuasive anecdotes, interviews and news clips that most of the audience is left in horror, disgust or laughter.\nThere's no question that Moore is biased, but he's so thorough, so passionate, so sincere that by the end of the movie one can't help but wonder if there's not a whole lot more truth to what he's conveying than anyone was ever willing to admit out loud.\nEvery American, of every political, cultural and racial persuasion should see this movie for themselves. And from there, let their consciences be their guide.

If however you're looking for intellectual honesty and integrity of the facts a supposed documentary uses to prove its point, then this a one star, and barely even that.  This flick is horribly biased and distorted to the point of outright lying, as Moore is a master of redirection ans taking things out of context to get us to believe what he wants us to believe.\n\n-He shows the secret service guarding the Saudi Embassy and asks rhetorically why.  If he checked his sources (and it would be quite bizarre if he didn't) he would have known the Secret Service's bylaws say they can provide extra security to embassies when asked (and not just for the Saudis), but instead Moore implies there ""may be"" some financial favoritism between them and Bush.\n\n-He shows a video of a meeting between the Taliban and gov't officials, and Moore asked rhetorically why this is so.  If he checked his sources (which happens to be his own video) he would have known that it was to demand they turn Bin Laden over, but instead Moore implies there ""may be"" some financial favoritism between them and Bush.\n\n-He reports that ""while Bush was governor of texas the Taliban visited his state for a meeting with oil executives over building oil pipes in their country"".  Moore has to know that Bush had nothing to do with this meeting (it was actually with Clinton officials) so the only reason Moore would care to even mention Bush is to falsely imply that he did...without actually coming out and saying he did.\n\nYou get the picture.  Moore deliberately takes innoculous facts and makes them look like something they're not, and then asks a supposedly rhetorical question so he can supply his own intended answer which he repeats until you start believing it- Bush putting financial deals over the welfare of the country.\n\nWhen the facts he quotes aren't incriminating enough, he spices them up.  He can then honestly say that everything he says is true because he really doesn't say anything.  He portrays what he wants you to think on your own.  With this kind of deliberate misdirection, one can even make mother Theresa look like a Nazi war criminal.\n\nLike Bush or hate Bush, it really doesn't matter.

1359;379.0;5.0;23.0;"The most controversial film of the year has finally arrived to theatres.  It's the movie that A LOT of people don't want you to see, hence why it had to go through so many obstacles to get a public release.  It's also a movie that people cannot stop talking about, whether they love it or hate it.  What I'm talking about is none other than Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" which is an unrelenting assault on the Bush Administration.  There is a very clear purpose of this movie, and that is to show the incompetence and the unspeakable acts perpetrated by G.W. and company and their handling of the Iraq War.\nFrom the get-go, you know that Moore has an agenda and he doesn't shy away from it.  He never backs down from it, as well.  From the very first minute, President George W. Bush is shown to us in a very unfavorable fashion.  We see him as a slacker who really hates being at the White House since he's always vacationing.  We see him sit in a classroom for well over seven minutes when he is told that our country is under attack, holding a very bewildered expression on his face.  Moore brings us some pretty devastating evidence that points to a relationship between the Bush family and Saudi Arabia.  Not only that, but we are told that while every plane in the U.S. was grounded, the Bin Ladin Family was able to catch flights out of our country without ever being questioned by the FBI (according to Moore).  The film has some very humorous moments in it, which include Moore trying to get members of Congress to enlist their own children to go to Iraq--the expressions on their faces are absolutely priceless as they run away in horror and in disgust from Moore.  However, there are gut-wrenching and devastating moments like seeing dead and injured soldiers, and the breakdown of a mother who has lost her son in the war.  When you add all of these elements together, you get a very thought-provoking and disturbing portrait of the Bush Administration.\nMake no mistake, as Michael Moore never shies away from the fact that he has made this movie to get Bush out of office.  He admits that.  His agenda is always clear and he never tells you otherwise.  And yet, he doesn't just simply tell you that G.W. is an incompetent guy and leaves it at that.  He gives you his reasons and he backs them up with his evidence.  I cannot verify the accuracy of this film, as I am not a political analyst.  What I can verify is that Moore makes a pretty convincing case and this movie raises some serious accusations that really need to be answered, even if they only turn out to be nothing more than accusations in the end.\nIs this film nothing more than propaganda?  I don't think so.  Usually, propaganda is used in hopes that it will have everybody coming to the same conclusions.  You won't find that with this movie.  People who are for Bush will most likely still be for Bush after seeing the movie, and people who are against Bush will still resent Bush after the movie.  There is always a chance that the movie may change some people's opinions, but I don't really think it will change people's minds all that much.  However, what I do hope is that the film will have people thinking and asking the hard and tough questions that this administration should have to answer.\nI think that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a big triumph for Michael Moore.  He took a lot of chances and risks making this movie.  It is clear that it is a project that he absolutely believes in since he handles it with absolute care.  Whether you're on the Left or on the Right, I think this is something that should be seen by everyone, even if you don't agree with Moore's tactics or opinions.  Nobody should tell you how to feel about this movie, it should only be you who comes to such a decision.  A very well done and powerful presentation from Mr. Moore.  As always, he did not disappoint me. -Michael Crane";"""He did what anybody else would do... he went on vacation."""

363;385.0;1.0;22.0;While I can tolerate that Michael Moore has to right to express his opinion, I find it incredibly unethical for him to call this film a documentary.  A documentary is typically made to be as objective as possible.  In particular, you would not find many honest filmmakers intentionally including misleading films clips in a documentary.  The only thing Moore documents is how fanatical he and others are with their hatred of Bush and his administration.  Their treatment of this medium says more about them than it does about the president.;Bias attempting to pass itself off as documentary
388;386.0;5.0;22.0;I'm sorry to say that but I remember when I was living in NY seeing two anarchists being spanked by four policemen inside Penn Station, NY, just because they were distributing some fliers that questioned the legitimacy of the American voting system. The beating was as brutal as it would be in any third-world dictatorship. The fliers were confiscated and the two men arrested. That was the year of 1988. 18 years have passed and nothing changed: you do have a dictator as president, who employs the same brainwash routines used by his kind all over the world. Going to war is one of them. Patriotism is another one. And all of that in the name of goodness and God. The most absurd thing is not to realize that the terrorists only exist because of the American foreign policy over the years. Why did they blow WTC out, not the Eiffel Tower? The answer is as simple as it is absurd people keep voting for him hoping that USA can be free of terrorism. Collecting hate from all over the world is not a wise policy towards this goal. Moore's works are trying to reveal the evil inside and all around Bush. I suggest him making a movie about how the world sees USA today. We can't be wrong: we are billions against 59,459,765 voters. And we have 49% of the American voters on our side. All of that makes Fahrenheit 9/11 the most important movie and book of its time.

I am only 17 and I know that a few of my friends went to watch this film and came back just believing that the U.S.A was a terrible place to live because of President Bush.  President Bush is a great man with great morals and beliefs.  I cannot believe some one would have the nerve to publicly try to humiliate our President.  Michael Moore is an idiot.  He just needs to tell the truth before making a film and making a fool of himself.  I love the U.S.A and hate Michael Moore.  If you are a patriot to this great country, I advise you not to support this fool buy watching and listening to his lies.";A minupulator trying his best
523;388.0;5.0;22.0;"Beyond all the controversy there is one reason why this film has been so successful: it strips away the faade that this administration has erected in an effort to prevent the people from seeing the actual results of its mistaken policies.  Just as people will rubberneck to catch a glimpse of an accident, people are driven to see this movie to witness the unvarnished realities of the Bush administration: massive debt, overwhelming government growth, rampant militarism and the loss of world respect (just to name a few).\n\nMoore uses a good balance of humor and pathos to paint a portrait of how an unsuccessful businessman can ride the coattails of his wealthy friends and family all the way to the Whitehouse.  He goes on to show how this rich cabal uses their privileged position to further their agenda around the world with sometimes disastrous results.  Bush himself said it best when he addressed the audience at a fundraiser as the ""haves... and have mores"".  The unabashed hubris of this so called Christian is on display like feathers on a peacock.\n\nI can see from the one star ""reviews"" that many right wingers have not seen this film.  That's too bad.  They are depriving themselves of some truly first class humor.  For example, there is the hilarious introduction to our attorney general: ""In the year 2000, [John Ashcroft] was running for re-election as Senator from Missouri against a man who died the month before the election.  The voters preferred the dead guy.""  Even an Oxycontin addled ditto head should be able to appreciate the humor in that line.\n\nThere might even be a few republicans capable of comprehending some of Moore's more subtle jokes.  Take for instance the scene where he presents the military records documenting Bush's suspension for dodging a National Guard medical examination.  As the camera zooms in to show the condemning sentence and highlight Bush's name, the narration is interrupted for a couple seconds to play the guitar lick from Eric Clapton's version of ""Cocaine"".  Get it?  Now that is funny!\n\nMy favorite laugh-out-loud section is Moore's introduction to ""The Coalition of the Willing"" including Palau, Costa Rica, Iceland, Romania, The Netherlands, and Afghanistan.  If I'd had a mouth full of something when the clip from Nosferatu appeared, I would have spewed it all over the screen.\n\nOf course there are more serious moments that were just as effective.  The scenes that show how the war in Iraq is being fought by the economically underprivileged (definitely not Bush's haves and have mores), the gruesome footage from the war itself (surgical strikes -- nice clean war, yeah right Rumi), and the personal accounts of unnecessary loss of life drive home an unmistakable message: Bush and his cronies have made huge mistakes and the ""have nots"" are the ones paying for it.";Succeeds on all levels

It takes very little time to research the material to see that most of his ""facts"" are LIES. There is no truth in this ""movie"", it should be listed under fiction. If you watched any T.V. during and after 9/11 you would know there is no truth in this ""movie"". It's full of misquotes and outright lies. Moore should not call Bush a ""liar"" while he himself is lying. One example, Moore says ""There are no terrorists"" well I don't know about anyone else but when I turned on my television on September 11 2001, and seen two hijacked planes crashing into the Towers, I damn sure believed there were terrorists in this world. If he is right and there isn't then how come New York has a different skyline? And where did those 3,000 people go? If there are ""no terrorists"" then why are those people dead?

It's Moore's opinions drawn from these facts that people can choose to believe or not.  Moore presents the Bath connection and the connection to the Saudi royal family to support his claims that Bush's loyalty to the Saudis and the Bin Ladens presents a strong conflict of interest in his dealings with terrorism pre and post 9/11.  Moore shows the way the military preys on the poor for recruiting.  He supports his claim that the terrorist threat to the US is not what the Bush administration would like you to believe by showing the lack of protection at most of our borders.  When he talks about the 2000 election Moore shows the connections Bush had in Florida that helped him block the recount.  He presents strong arguments supported by facts, which is more than what can be said about the president.  There are a lot of reviews where people lament over all the ""lies"" in this film but don't present any examples.

770;393.0;4.0;22.0;"Michael Moore is obviously just as angry as any liberally minded American, and I am no exception. The helplessness that many feel under the current administration grows daily, and our faith in our leaders drops a little more each term.\n\nThe problem with Fahrenheit 9/11 is not necessarily the subject matter, but the way in which it is presented. There have been plenty of cool-headed news articles, TV shows, and radio broadcasts that lay out in great detail the many flaws and contradictions of George W. Bush, but none as venomous as Michael Moore's film. It is obvious that Moore is using every piece of data in his arsenal to dethrone Bush, but all too often he falls into the trap of sensationalism. Not to say that the actions of President Bush are not sensational themselves, but Moore 's version tends to boil the blood. Perhaps that is a good thing. Perhaps that's what voters need to get Bush out of office. The only issue I take with this sensationalistic approach is that it mimics the tactics of the far right. Radio personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or Ann Coulter all use the most extreme elements of liberalism as their ammunition while they ignore many points of raw fact. They form opinions based on deep-seated hatred of the ""other"" party simply because they are not ""them."" This is the attitude that I hoped liberal thinkers would not take part in. Unfortunately, this is the posture that Moore leans toward in his film.\n\nThe reason I take note of this, and believe it is worthy of discussion, is for the simple fact of credibility. I do this not to discredit Moore , nor do I do it to support Bush. I simply want a critical analysis, not just an analysis based on what I want to believe. In other words, I want to find out if everything Moore says is true, false, or smudged in-between. If I simply take what Moore tells me to be true, then I am no better than anyone who simply takes what anyone tells them to be true.\n\nMichael Moore uncovers little in his film that hasn't been addressed: the Bush connection with the Saudis, the Patriot Act issues, the 9/11 report, the alleged Iraq/al Qaeda connection, etc. These stories have been unfolding for the past few years and it was refreshing to see them all come together in a logical fashion. There are only two points that I wish Moore had been more careful in deliberating:\n\n1. The Saudi flight on 9/13\n\n2. The absent mention of Saddam as a murderous dictator\n\n1. The Saudi flight on 9/13\n\nI was discussing this with someone I know who's father is a big-wig at LAX. This person reminded me that the FAA lifted their ban on flights on 9/13, the same day Moore says NO ONE was allowed to fly. In fact, the FAA did lift their ban on many flights on 9/13. While most of the flights were still grounded, and many airports were kept closed by the FAA due to poor security, there were some flights that were allowed to fly (mostly flights that were already on route when the ban took effect). What Moore meant to say was that no NEW private or commercial flights were allowed at that immediate time.\n\nAlso, the independent 9/11 commission confirmed that the FBI did adequately interview 30 of the Saudis (it does not say if any of these 30 were from the bin-Laden family or not. We do know that some of the bin-Laden family was on board one or more of the flights in question which flew between 9/11-9/15). However, as Moore points out, it does seem highly suspect that the bin-Laden family was seemingly ushered out at the earliest convenience, and that they were not as thoroughly interviewed as they should have been in such dangerous time.\n\nThe point I'm making here is, while Moore 's statements were true, the whole picture was not painted for the public. He chose not to include the fact that SOME flights were being allowed by the FAA as a general lift of their ban. By avoiding this, Moore leaves us with a partial untruth, and these partial untruths are great ammunition for Bush supporters which ultimately only weaken Moore 's argument. By not revealing the fact that some flights were allowed to fly (whether or not it pertains directly or not the Saudi issue), Moore comes off as a manipulator of facts to his enemies. This in turn only discredits any true information he may have. By leaving out important elements, Moore 's enemies can say, ""Ah-ha! He twisted the story to suit his agenda, therefore we can't trust anything he says!""\n\n2. The absent mention of Saddam as a murderous dictator\n\nMoore paints a picture of how rosy life was before the US bombs hit Baghdad . He shows people in cafes, women walking the streets with smiles, and even kids flying kites. This can be viewed either as a portrait of how innocent Saddam's Iraq was, or how innocent people were killed (and still are) during the US attack. Of course, Moore is presenting the fact that many civilian casualties were killed, but the rosy picture portrayed could easily be read as, ""Saddam's Iraq was a swell place to live before the Americans arrived."" By not mentioning once that Saddam, at the very least, was a dictator that gassed many of his citizens and tortured many others, is irresponsible. This leaves the impression that Saddam's Iraq was just minding its own business, living in sweet harmony, when the US bombed away.\n\nNow, the case for or against invading Iraq is a different matter of which I am not commenting on here. I'm only pointing out that omitting some details of why Saddam was targeted by the Bush administration (right or wrong) were purposely left out to stir emotions instead of objective fact. Again, Moore is not necessarily lying, but he's leaving out important parts of the story. He's leading the public in a similar manner that a Limbaugh or Hannity might.\n\nOther than these two discrepancies, I felt that the film was very engaging and entertaining. Just the fact that the film was subject to banning and attempted banning in many cities attests to the power of cinema, and the power it has to sway the populace. This is why I commented on Moore 's approach. It is not meant to discredit him, as I mentioned before, but to hopefully bring to attention that even Michael Moore can make all the facts fit perfectly despite the fact that some facts are still clouded in mystery and subjection.\n\nEverything he portrayed in his film has been documented and covered by various books and articles over the past few years. So, while there is not much new evidence displayed here against Bush, it is nice to see all of the indictments come together under one roof, even if it is done with a sensationalistic flair of entertainment. But then again, if all this information was presented in a calm, cool fashion by a show like FRONTLINE, then millions of Americans might not ever see it, which begs the question, perhaps sensationalism is necessary for mass media to get its message across. But do the ends justify the means?";Entertaining Politics
774;394.0;5.0;22.0;"Finally, with ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" a bright and unavoidable light has been shined on things done in darkness. Any true American should shed tears when this important film tells how many legal Florida voters in democratic counties were disenfranchised on election day 2000, and how the subsequent wailings of leaders concerned about the damage done to our great democracy by what went down in Florida, fell on deaf ears in D.C. Something stunk that night in the sunshine state, and stinks to this very day, but, I guess it was clear early on that the we were entering a time when dissenting or questioning voices would be drowned out or silenced.\n\nFortunately, Michael Moore's voice could not be silenced and the Bush family power structure had no way to manipulate the results. That's right, Moore's pack-of-lies movie did make it into theatres and played to packed houses for weeks and weeks, and became water-cooler, lunchroom, chatroom, cellphone, email and dinner conversation all over our great land. Now the pack-of-lies is coming to DVD, and to the DVD audience, I say, welcome to the light.";what is done in darkness, comes to light
920;395.0;5.0;22.0;"Yes, that is how I feel about Moore's treatise of the events since the 2000 election.  I didn't think that I was the only one who noticed all those strange coincidences.  I'm grateful that he's made a movie for the average person, who in this day may not have to his or her disposal the meanings of the words, fascism and genocide.  Alas, there are still those even smaller minds (e.g., the person who wrote ""Moore Trash"") who awarded the DVD, Alex & Emma, with five blazing stars.  I do think that so-called romantic comedy remained in the theatres a bit longer than it took George the Second to get up from his seat in that Florida classroom after the second plane hit.

It is true that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but it isn't even needed in Mooron's case.  All he is interested in portraying is his own ideals regardless of the truth.  In that respect, the First Amendment doesn't apply to his movie, because it is nothing more than a delusional drama/comedy.  If you want to see a farce, then go ahead and see this movie.  However, if you are interested in factual information about our country and the President, please, for the sack of those that are dying to protect the First Amendment, go and do your research elsewhere when deciding who to vote for for President.

Thiers, ours, and the full truth. I bought the DVD to watch and ended up burning it in the fire. Not because of the content more because of our men and women fighting over there. Like stated ""This is another Vietnam"" My father was in that war and I thank god every day that he came home to me only to have people calling him a baby killer. COME ON PEOPLE. we need to support our men and women in any way needed and let them know we stand behind them and give them out stength.

Worth renting, but definitely not worth buying.  No wonder this clown got booed off the stage at the Oscars.";Tokyo Rose is Alive and Well in Michael Moore
506;409.0;1.0;21.0;Moore is great at what he does: Spinning a series of video clips to match his personal view of the issue. This movie is no exception. It's not at all a documentary, and if you know that, and loath/hate George Bush, and don't like to research the facts of a situation, but let a filmmaker with a hardcore view of the world dictate your views to you, you'll love this movie. LOVE it.;"Entertainment - not ""truth"""
558;410.0;5.0;21.0;I am a liberal.  I make no bones about it.  But I believe that the role of the press is to provide unbiased and accurate information about the political process.  Moore, though not unbiased, does give an accurate account of the current events surrounding the war on Iraq.\n\nEven I, a self proclaimed liberal, was a little unsettled by the release of this film.  I feared that it might be a proganda film, filled with inaccuracies.  My fears were quickly quelled.  There is no doubt that Moore only exposed that which he wanted us to see.  In the opening seqence he showed Gore winning a variety of states but failed to show a single state (besides Florida) being called for Bush.\n\nEverything he did show, however, was accurate to the best of my knowledge.  Moore did not engage in any of the silly accusations of the recently retired CIA agent that accused the administration of blackmailing the CIA into presenting false intelligence or any other wild accusatisions.  Intsead he focused on the Bush family's ties to the Saudis.\n\nFahrenheit 911 is also informative.  I watch and/or read some form of news media nearly every day but there still many facts presented that I did not know previous to watching this film.  Worth the learning experience.;Liberal, but Accurate
619;411.0;5.0;21.0;This is a brilliant film.  What is most damning is not any political slant that Moore may be projecting, but the video footage of George W. Bush.  Nothing Moore could say could make him appear any more incompetent and foolish than he already is.  I also loved the numerous clips where Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell and Rumsfeld all link Iraq to 911 and Al Quaida.  Juxtapose that with Cheney's whopping lie during the VP debate where he denied linking the two.\n\nThe connect the dots with the Saudi's and Bin Laden family was fun.  But the film has a lot of poignant moments as well, including the military mom that lost her son in Iraq.  Perhaps the scariest moment of the film wasn't the sound and footage of the terrorist attack of 911 or Karl Rove putting spit into his hair (yuk!), but Bush sitting there for 7 minutes continuing with his photo op after being told the country was under attack.  Most people would have politely excused themselves and looked into what was going on.  AWOL again.  The man who is sworn to protect us and this is how he handles a crisis?\n\nVery revealing film, a must see for every American.;Brilliant
653;412.0;4.0;21.0;"I would first like to say Thank you Mr. Moore. I thank you for never ever backing down when we were all supposed to be ""rallying behind our commander in chief"". Whether it was release ""Stupid White Men"", or this movie, you are a brave man. Plus, your movie raked in over $100 Million! Let's see ""Michael Moore Hates America"" outdo that.\n\nAs far as the movie itself. Truthfully, I knew a lot of the stuff that was presented in this movie. Not all of it; the stuff I didn't know was more shocking then what I did. The footage of the senate floor was very appaling. I couldn't believe that not one senator came forward. Where were you Russ Feingold? The Iraq footage was equally shocking. Wait, no, a little more shocking. These last four years have been hard on us all. Are we prepared, physically, financially, and emotionally for Four More Years?\n\nThis is not Moore's best movie. I still say that Roger and Me is the best movie he has made to date. Dude, Where's My Country? is also not Moore's best, although the title was hysterical. I have to say that Downsize This! is Moore's best book. Regardless, keep fighting the good fight, Mr. Moore.";Good...Real good....yeah...
666;413.0;5.0;21.0;"For all the controversy surrounding this film, the point is almost missed with a lot of people.  Had the mainstream, corporate media had done their jobs, this documentary would not have to be made.  The myth of the liberal media is constantly perpetrated by the right wing to goad them into being more lax on the conservative views and tougher on liberal views to prove that the media is ""fair and balanced.""  Had the media been liberal, there seriously would have been a tougher fight and challenge to the Bush administration in the days following the 2000 elections.  The lies of the Bush campaign would have been more fodder than Gore's exaggerations regarding Love Story, Love canal, and the Internet.  The most enlightening thing about this film is that I never knew that no Senator sided with members of the black caucus in the U.S. House to formally protest the 2000 elections in Florida (the disenfranchisement of the African American vote).  Why didn't Senator Feingold, the conscience of the Senate, come to their aid?  Is the U.S. Senate that cliquey that they can just tell members of Congress to sit down and shut up if no Senator signed their protest petition?  This was all new to me, because no where in our ""liberal media"" was that story ever mentioned.  Since I don't have cable, I can't see CSPAN to know what's going on in the bowels of our government.  For that reason alone, I'm grateful to Moore for bringing it to our attention.\n\nMy favorite scene in this film is the use of Bush's ""Top Gun"" type flight to the USS Abraham Lincoln to pronounce ""Mission Accomplished"" in Iraq, just a month and a half after the war began, and when just around 100 military members lost their lives.  It was a footage that Republicans hoped to use at their Convention but backfired because of the mess Iraq has become.  What made this footage even more brilliant was Moore's selection of the song from ""Greatest American Hero"" (""Believe it or not"") to illustrate his point (I especially loved the line, ""it should have been somebody else""--a not to subtle nod that the presidency does indeed belong to someone else).\n\nSome criticisms have focused on ""potshots"", the private scenes of Bush goofing for the camera before announcing that the war is on, Wolfowitz licking his comb to wet down his hair, Condi getting her face powdered, and Ashcroft singing horribly a song he wrote.  Yes, they are potshots, but the administration has brought it on themselves with their not too hidden disdain of the American people.  If people would read the history books, they'll see that this sort of ridiculing of the people in power isn't new.  During the reign of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the people burned in effigy members of the government, put on adult rated puppet shows showing members of the Royal family in a negative light, and worse.  The relations between the people in power and the people who are governed rests on a mutual respect, and when an administration has shown its contempt for American values again and again, ridicule is sometimes the only way to get back at them.  Besides all that, I don't recall hearing much protest against some of the things conservatives joked about regarding Clinton and his administration.  That's the beauty of living in a free society...our leaders are not above ridicule if they invite it upon themselves.\n\nThis film is a tad bit long and could have been cut some, especially the parts about the lone policeman patrolling Oregon's long border.  That's all interesting stuff that could have been a side feature mini-documentary on the DVD rather than be a part of the actual film.  I felt that it slowed the film down and sidetracked it just a little from the main focus of the film, which is the war in Iraq.\n\nWhat surprised me most about this film was how funny it was.  There haven't been much to laugh about since the 2000 elections and 9/11, but Moore brilliantly manages to find the humor in these strange times, mostly at the expense of the people hired to govern us, but also in the deceptive manner in which Marine recruiters go about looking for recruits.  I loved how the Marine asked someone his name and address to cross him off their list, while writing it down instead to send a brochure later.  I'm surprised that the Marines would allow themselves to be portrayed making false promises of wealth and fame to college bound teenagers.  That's one part of the documentary I'd like to see documentation on, because its simply too good to be true that Moore caught the Marines being deceptive like that on camera.\n\nThis film ends on such a devastating blow to the Administration, using the words of Britney Spears and George W. Bush concerning trust and not getting fooled again.  I loved that Moore read some passages from Orwell's ""1984"", the most relevant novel of the times about how the government can switch enemies in the middle of a war and its citizens don't blink an eye, and how war is used more to control the populace at home than to bring about a serious victory in another country.  Yes, when it all boils down to it, why should we send our young and less economically affluent to die in overseas wars for rich men who avoided war when they had their chance to serve?  When are we going to wake up to the truth that we are the ones who will ultimately pay the cost in blood so that a few can get rich and gain evermore power.  This film is the wake up call of our generation.  Will we heed that call before too many more lives are ruined?";Doing what the corporate media failed to do
697;414.0;4.0;21.0;I saw Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Did he take things out of context?  Maybe.  Did he edit his movie so that it looked to be saying one thing?  Sure.  But did he lie?  No.  Tha facts were accurate, and that is really what the sad thing is.\n\nThis movie did what the purpose was.  To get people talking.  To get people thinking.  Of course, it is controversial.  But it was suppose to be!!\n\nHopefully more people can see this movie.  It was well made and deserving of all the acclaim that is has gotten.  Would I call it a GREAT movie?

When you're making propaganda, the last thing you want to do is get bogged down my details.  You lose the emotional effect of your audience when you do that. Ask Karl Rove and George W. Bush on that.\n\nWatch the movie and then independantly search the truth and forget all about michaelmoore.com and ihatemichaelmoore.com (persumably, there is one).  You shouldn't blindly accept this movie as truth, but watch it as part of the process of questioning our President which we all need to do.;It interests me...

There is plenty to criticism the Bush Administration on, but believing in these ""black helicopter"" conspiracy theories, just puts one out on the fridge. Lets just take one example. We invaded Afghanistan so we can build a pipeline. Well, we have been in there three years now and NO PIPELINE is being built. The truth is two company's back in the mid 90s considered building a pipeline in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration even helped one of the company's bu talking with the Taliban about it. But it never came off. if was considered unfeasible and not worth it. So its a lie by Mr. Moore. I can document all 59 lies, but suffice it to say, if a witness is wrong on one materiel fact, they you must or may distrust all his ""facts.""

And the first thing that strikes me about the DVD release, though I saw the film in the theaters is, it was, as a friend pointed out to me, strategically brilliant to have the release coincide with the debates and the weeks preceding the election.\n\nThat said, when you look at this film on DVD, turn the sound off, and read the commentary using the subtitles, and make a conscious effort to just observe the leader of this country, and the factual information about him - ignore the editorializing (There isn't much, but when you see what is obviously an opinion and not the reporting of a fact, just ignore it.)\n\nThen just listen to the words that come out of the mouth of the current leader of the free world.

817;420.0;5.0;21.0;"In literature, one's premises and view of US politics and history are quickly destabilized and reconstructed by Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (Alexander Cockburn, and Jeffrey St. Clair) and Lies My Teacher Told me by Professor James Loewen. This is exactly what Michael Moore does with the tools of film and cinema. What was presented visually was common knowledge to those of us who choose to be inform and was consistent with The September 11 Commission's 567-page final report has confirmed key facts presented in Fahrenheit 9/11. These include; Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265 After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, he went ahead with his classroom event. After Bush was informed that the nation was under attack after the second plane hit, Bush stayed in the classroom for nearly seven more minutes, continuing to read with the children. Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 35, 38-39. Bush failed to have even one meeting to discuss the threat of terrorism with his head of counterterrorism Richard Clarke. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 201. Bush failed to react to the August 6, 2001 security briefing, ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 260-262. 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country after September 13. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 556, n. 25 [Note that Fahrenheit 9/11 understates the number of Saudis who left.] Individuals were interviewed by the FBI before being allowed to leave (although the report confirms that most individuals on these flights were not interviewed.) Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 557, n. 28. White House former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke approved these flights. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329. It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including: What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly were the flights arranged by the U.S. government? Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: ""At a time when 14 of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections."" Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew of Osama bin Laden, who ""was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth"" (WAMY), which the FBI has described as ""a suspected terrorist organization,"" and that the bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that ""has been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps traveling with President Bush. The film is correct on all major facts presented. Opponents tend to argue on cosmetics and semantics rather than the documented facts. Very reminiscent of what happened to Gary Webb and ""Dark Alliances"".\n\n(...)";Turning up the heat to Fahrenheit 9/11

That man has been giving us lies from the very beginning. This film is very less funny and moore like than any of his films. This is much darker, disturbing, and truthful.

Oh it is ok if a few slip through and make it up to the big time. They are not a threat. They always join the club and quickly forget where they came from.\n\nI guess my being raised in an orphanage and being treated like a piece of crap, for many years, has made me aware of what the rich can do to those living below their standards.\n\nCould what happened in Russia, Iraq and Germany, as well as many other countries in the world ever happen here in America?

949;426.0;1.0;21.0;What a disgrace, how many lies can you pile in one movie? If you don't research your information, this movie is harmful. It has already been proven that the majority of the movie is lies, taken out of content, fabricated newspapers and documents, made to make our military and president look stupid. Michael Moore admits to being a communist. His movie is pushed to groups like Hamas as a anti American movie. This is harmful to every one, because if you think their were no democrats killed on 9/11 your a bigger fool than Michael Moore. Dont waste your money on this slob. He has been quoted over seas stating that the reason americans are walking around with smiles on their faces is because we are too stupid to know any better. Michael Moore has no dignity, and deserves a kick in the backside right out the country he thinks is so stupid.;Fat Boy Steals your Money!
964;427.0;1.0;21.0;"Don't believe everything you see.  Michael Moore is very one sided and has one goal.  Do your own research and make an informed decision not one based on crap you see in a movie.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 begins on election night 2000. We are first shown Al Gore rocking on stage with famous musicians and a high-spirited crowd. The conspicuous sign on stage reads ""Florida Victory."" Moore creates the impression that Gore was celebrating his victory in Florida. Moore's voiceover claims, ""And little Stevie Wonder, he seemed so happy, like a miracle had taken place."" The verb tense of past perfect (""had taken"") furthers the impression that the election has been completed.\n\nActually, the rally took place in the early hours of election day, before polls had even opened. Gore did campaign in Florida on election day, but went home to Tennessee to await the results. The ""Florida Victory"" sign reflected Gore's hopes, not any actual election results. (""Gore Campaigns Into Election Day,"" Associated Press, Nov. 7, 2000.)\nThe film shows CBS and CNN calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, ""Then something called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other guy....All of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'""\n\nWe then see NBC anchor Tom Brokaw stating, ""All of us networks made a mistake and projected Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our mistake.""\nMoore thus creates the false impression that the networks withdrew their claim about Gore winning Florida when they heard that Fox said that Bush won Florida.\n\nIn fact, the networks which called Florida for Gore did so early in the evening-before polls had even closed in the Florida panhandle, which is part of the Central Time Zone. NBC called Florida for Gore at 7:49:40 p.m., Eastern Time. This was 10 minutes before polls closed in the Florida panhandle. Thirty seconds later, CBS called Florida for Gore. And at 7:52 p.m., Fox called Florida for Gore. Moore never lets the audience know that Fox was among the networks which made the error of calling Florida for Gore prematurely. Then at 8:02 p.m., ABC called Florida for Gore. Only ABC had waited until the Florida polls were closed.\nAbout an hour before the polls closed in panhandle Florida, the networks called the U.S. Senate race in favor of the Democratic candidate. The networks seriously compounded the problem because from 6-7 Central Time, they repeatedly announced that polls had closed in Florida--even though polls were open in the panhandle. (See also Joan Konner, James Risser & Ben Wattenberg, Television's Performance on Election Night 2000: A Report for CNN, Jan. 29, 2001.)\nThe false announcements that the polls were closed, as well as the premature calls (the Presidential race ten minutes early; the Senate race an hour early), may have cost Bush thousands of votes from the conservative panhandle, as discouraged last-minute voters heard that their state had already been decided; some last-minute voters on their way to the polling place turned around and went home. Other voters who were waiting in line left the polling place. In Florida, as elsewhere, voters who have arrived at the polling place before closing time often end up voting after closing time, because of long lines. The conventional wisdom of politics is that supporters of the losing candidate are most likely to give up on voting when they hear that their side has already lost. Thus, on election night 1980, when incumbent President Jimmy Carter gave a concession speech while polls were still open on the west coast, the early concession was blamed for costing the Democrats several Congressional seats in the West, such as that of 20-year incumbent James Corman. The fact that all the networks had declared Reagan a landslide winner while west coast voting was still in progress was also blamed for Democratic losses in the West; Congress even held hearings about prohibiting the disclosure of exit polls before voting had ended in the any of the 48 contiguous states.\n\nEven if the premature television calls affected all potential voters equally, the effect was to reduce Republican votes significantly, because the Florida panhandle is a Republican stronghold. Most of Central Time Zone Florida is in the 1st Congressional District, which is known as the ""Redneck Riviera."" In that district, Bob Dole beat Bill Clinton by 69,000 votes in 1996, even though Clinton won the state by 300,000 votes. So depress overall turnout in the panhandle, and you will necessarily depress more Republican than Democratic votes. A 2001 study by John Lott suggested that the early calls cost Bush at least 7,500 votes, and perhaps many more. Another study reported that the networks reduced panhandle turn-out by about 19,000 votes, costing Bush about 12,000 votes and Gore about 7,000 votes.\n\nAt 10:00 p.m., which networks took the lead in retracting the premature Florida win for Gore? They were CNN and CBS, not Fox. (The two networks were using a shared Decision Team.) See Linda Mason, Kathleen Francovic & Kathleen Hall Jamieson, ""CBS News Coverage of Election Night 2000: Investigation, Analysis, Recommendations"" (CBS News, Jan. 2001), pp. 12-25.)\n\nIn fact, Fox did not retract its claim that Gore had won Florida until 2 a.m.--four hours after other networks had withdrawn the call.";People need to do there own research.

974;428.0;5.0;21.0;"Clearly this is a movie with an agenda: to wake up America with the hopes of showing Bush the door in 2004.  It is all about igniting passions against what is portrayed as a corrupt and inept administration, not about presenting an unbiased look at Bush and Company.  Unlike certain ""so-called"" journalistic institutions on the Right, though, Michael Moore does not pretend to be ""fair & balanced"".  There is no pretense here.  The filmmaker is acting as a powerful advocate for his point of view, and in doing so, does not owe it to his audience to present ""both sides of the story"".\n\nLord knows we're bombarded with the ""other side of the story"" every day by an anything-but-liberal mass media that is increasingly wary of criticizing the Bush administration for fear of being blacklisted as unpatriotic.  (The movie itself almost didn't make it to the theaters when its original distributors pulled the plug, allegedly the result of Bush cashing in a political favor).  Let us make no mistake, though, whether you agree with Moore's point of view or not, and whether you have a favorable impression of the sitting administration or not, Michael Moore is indeed a patriot.  Contrary to what certain pundits and talk-radio hosts would have you believe, Michael Moore is not a flag burner, rather he embraces the flag, but more importantly, he embraces its true meaning.  Contrary to much of the movie's unfounded criticism, one only needs to see the first ten minutes to realize that the filmmaker is a man who truly loves America.  His mission in creating the film and criticizing the present administration is not to bring down America, but rather to save it from itself.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 is not a perfect film, but its an important film.  Whether you sit on the right, on the left, or somewhere between, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  Whether or not you agree with the film's point of view, Michael Moore should be applauded precisely because he is sparking the sort of heartfelt debate in our society that has been silent since the horrors of September 11th.  For the three years since the attacks, we, as a society, have been understandably numb as we began to heal from the shock of the new reality that has been thrust upon us.  As the scabs of our wounds begin to peel, though, it is vital that we bring a spirit of discourse back to this country, lest this freedom we prize so dearly degenerate into nothing more than a kinder, gentler totalitarianism.";Stirring Passions in the Midst of an Era of Numbness

As he did in a similar scenario in F 9/11's predecessor, Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore attempts to pin the blame for the terrorist attacks on the WTC and Pentagon on everybody from President Bush to VP Dick Cheney and Halliburton through slickly edited interviews with people who lost loved loved ones in the 9/11 attacks and the war on terror in Iraq, as well as folks who just plain don't like Bush.\n\nLike a poor marksman, however, Moore keeps missing the real target he should be blaming: al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as those in our own government who did not pass along the information alerting the President to this situation.  THEY are the ones that should be blamed for 9/11, and yet Moore points the finger at the Bush administration, judging them for all the evil in the world.\n\nNice try, Moore, but I'm not buying.;Michael Moore needs a new job....

All your emotions come tumbling out as the movie speeds by all the events since George Bush got (S)elected.\n\nMoore does quite a lot of footage on the disenfranchisement of black voters, recruitment of poor minorities by the armed services in the poor places in town, etc.  Then he builds back up to the Bush Administration and the movie ends in such a way that my audience stood up and cheered!  He got on the Democrats too, by the way, for their support of the war in Iraq.  He got on both parties for allowing the GREED to infiltrate the Congress.  The documentary was vetted by the CIA for factuality.\n\nEveryone should see it, it will give you a terrific ride and make you think for days about the implications of everything in the movie.";This is a great movie!
1247;435.0;5.0;21.0;Michael Moore's latest documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, is a film that everyone should see, liberal or conservative or moderate or whatever you may consider yourself.  Even if you don't agree with everything that Moore says, it will really get you thinking about politics and the Bush administration, which a lot of us as Americans have not been doing.\n  I'm 14, and I convinced my dad, who considers himself a conservative, to take me to this movie.  When we walked out, and for the rest of the day, I could tell he was thinking about the movie, and although he doesn't exactly like Moore or what he had to say, F9/11 forced him to re-evaluate his opinions on many, many issues addressed in this movie.\n  If there's one movie out right now that you should see, this is it.;Amazing
1266;436.0;5.0;21.0;Unfortunately, Moore is trying to raise the awareness of a public with absolutely no sense of history, as is made clear by the last reviewer. George Bush--whose daughters, like their father, have found campaigning in safety more attractive than going to war for the cause they supposedly believe in--is a greater president than Lincoln? Roosevelt? Truman? What has he accomplished except to squander the sympathy the world showed after 9-11, spend the surplus, and make the wealthy even wealthier? As Moore points out, Bush is inspiring more terrorists than we can kill while he turns a blind eye to our allies' (like Musharaff) giving a free pass to the man who we know sold nuclear weapons to Iran, the very country we armed Saddam Hussein to weaken. I have a suggestion, If Bush's war is just, why don't you guys head on over to your recruiter. Or would it be harder to be for the war--as Moore implies of Congress--if fighting actually cost you something!;Greatest President Ever?
1287;437.0;5.0;21.0;This was a very effective movie and better than I expected. The weakest parts are those which feature Mr. Moore himself, and fortunately he wisely remains behind the camera most of the time. He lets the story tell itself, through real footage of Bush and his cronies and war profiteers revealing their crimes and sins for all to see.\nHe also puts a very human and moving face on war, showing Iraqi civilians, GIs both in combat and recovering from crippling wounds, and the grieving families of American soldiers killed in Iraq, including the riveting Lila Lipscomb.\nSure, Moore selectively edits his footage to back up his opinions, but so does every single documentarian in the world. Every single one. If you don't think that is true, you're probably not quite clear on what documentaries actually are. They are not academic research or journalism, but constructed opinions regarding real life events and people.\nWhatever you think of Bush, Michael Moore, or Iraq, you can not deny the reality of these peoples' lives presented in this movie.

1457;439.0;5.0;21.0;"I saw Farenheit 9/11 this morning in a packed movie theater in a rich, politically conservative suburb of Dallas, TX where it received good reviews and even a standing ovation and numerous claps by some in the audience. I'm glad to see stories reported in the Washington Post, BBC, NPR, and in AP stories finally come together in this sobering documentary on the Bush Administration's reaction regarding Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq War.\n  Before anyone says it's 'inaccurate"", hopefully the reviewer has actually seen the movie and remember if it is inaccurate then director Michael Moore would be sued for slander and/or libel. That hasn't happened.\n  Instead Moore uses quotes from uses senators and representatives, footage from congressional sessions, interviews with U.S. soldiers and Iraqi people who have had family members killed, and shows how Choicepoints and Katherine Harris used inaccurate information to steal the 2000 election for Bush.\n  The movie starts off with the 2000 election and the confusion over who actually won Floriday. It made me very angry to realize how no U. S. senators responded to numerous African American U.S. representatives' and their constituents'  requests to have a full recount in Florida following the 2000 elections. All that was needed to do this was one signature from one U.S. senator but none came through.\n  The movie details George W. Bush's business connections with the Bin Laden family in the Carlisle company where the family and wealthy companies get rich off of oil and war, or defense weapons. Moore hits the nail right on the head and finally explains the detailed reality of Bush's critics going to Iraq for oil.\n  I was so shell shocked throughout the movie listening to a U.S. troop gladly talk about how he likes to play the song "" the roof is on fire"" when he rides in the tank on the way to fight in Baghdad, or burn up Baghdad.\n  Footage of U.S. troops toying with a dead Iraqi body tickling his feet asking the body if it's ticklish and referring to the dead person's sexual organs in an obscene way shows there are more than just physical caused by war: it also weighs heavily on the troops' souls and pshcye.\n  It also shows a mom living in Flint, MI, where at least 50 % of the population is unemployed or have exhausted their unemployment benefits. The mom proudly talks about how her family has always been in the military and how her daugher and son are in the military.\nWhen she learns that her son is dead from fighting in Iraq she later is seen surrounded by her family reading the last letter her son wrote to her from Iraq. He said he didn't know why George (W. Bush) sent the troops over to Iraq. ""we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction"" and he sayid ""Bush just sent everyone to war to fight a war for his dad."" Her son also said he hoped ""the fool (Bush) is not re-elected.) I cried through this, as I did at the beginning of the film when footage is shown of horrified people's reactions in NYC after the planes immediately hit the twin towers. I wasn't the only one crying since I heard some sniffles and people near me were crying during different parts of the film.\n  The movie was the hardest film I've had to watch because the Iraq war is ongoing and so much information has come out  that was detailed in the film just within the last few years. It's alot easier to stomach fiction and actors portraying someone. It's almost impossible to watch Bush say stupid remars such as  ""Your are the haves and the have-mores. I call you my base"" to people sitting at a fund-raiser dinner, while a U.S. troops points out to  Moore that he's only getting paid appx $2,000 to $3,000 monthly for serving in Iraq while Halliburton workers in the same area make appx $6,000 monthly to do construction. Moore also mentions how Bush cut terrorist defense spending prior to 9/11 and how he cut health and other benefits to military personnel and vets and how he's helped close numerous veteran hospitals.\n  The movie asks all the right questions about an administation that has almost made it a crime to do so,or at least accuse anyone who does question the Bush Administration as being ""unpatriotic.""

He's the definition of a hypocrite and ignorant fool rolled into one big ugly hairball of a subhuman being.  His pandering behaviour overseas is very shameful and insulting to all Americans.

Yes, soldiers representing the American people took pictures with bound Iraqi prisoners in an inhumane manner. Yes, that is an Iraqi child's arm sliced to ribbons. Yes, our sons and daughters are dying while the Bush twins wear fancy dresses.\n\nStep back from Michael Moore and just look at the movie. He really only appears as a narrator and an interviewer, cutting his stunts from ""Bowling for Columbine"" down to one chuckle-inducing trip in an ice cream truck.\n\nOne thing Moore's detractors keep bringing up is the fact that he's wealthy. Frankly, this is a hilarious claim to make considering the fact that George W. Bush and his entire family is not exactly self-made. I think making money off of your art is much more noble than through your oil tycoon family. So what if he was born into a middleclass family? Most of Americans *are* middleclass. He made his money, he didn't inherit it. Isn't that the American dream? To rise through your own efforts?\n\nYou can't claim something is totally fictional when it uses real footage. I'm sorry but, YES our president SAT there. If you really want an un-biased look at the film, just mute whenever Moore talks. Listen to the president. Listen to the mother. Listen to the soldiers.

The conservative 'documentry' that was made in response to this movie, 'Fahrenhype 9/11', actually contains a lot less truth than this one.\n\nI really suggest that you put your politcal sentiments aside and enjoy this movie.  Watch it looking neither to bash the president or with such a closed mind that you won't accept any information as fact.  This is a critically acclaimed documentary for a reason: it was put together very well, and no one should question Michael Moore's skill at drawing the emotions he intended to draw.  Get over politics and learn something about current events.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is more informative than CNN or Fox News was during the past couple months.\n\nIn short: if you're intelligent enough to look past the liberal bias and/or watch this movie with an open mind, I strongly suggest it.";"The election's long over; Intellectuals should buy this DVD."

Now we have the ironic twist, and the witty voice-overs!\n\nGranted, there are a few issues that Moore brings up that warrent further analysis, like the massive Saudi investment in the US, and how it can create conflicts of interest among politicians.  But the moment the film starts getting interesting, it switches gears, and begins a long, hysterical, tirade against Bush and his Iraq policy.  There are long, long, sequences, without dialogue, in which we are shown exploded bombs, and weeping mothers.  I felt like I was watching something Joseph Goebbels put together.  Many of the ""facts"" are not even accurate.  The Saudi citizens in the US did not fly out under the flight ban -it was afterwards.  FOX News initially said that Gore had won Florida, not Bush, the list goes on and on.  The worst thing about it, is that Moore knows he is manipulating facts, and yet does so with impunity.\n\nI was also hoping for some humor.  I didn't find any.  I simply don't find Moore to be particularly funny.  He also has a poor speaking voice.  the next time he does a film, he should get an actor to read the script for him.\n\nThe only reason this film won any awards is because of the politics behind it.

It was Voltaire who said ""I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" And that philosophy heavily influenced Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers.  More than any other nation in history, America is a country where the rights and beliefs of the citizens - even those who disagree- are protected.\n\nIf you believe that Michael Moore is a big fat liberal nutcase, you have every right in America to believe that. If you offer any opinion on ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when you haven't even SEEN it - you're showing off your ignorance, and in America I get to believe that too.\n\nCertainly Michael Moore made the movie to bash George W. Bush and to prevent his re-election.  But not only is his right to do that protected in America, (And I thank God every day to live in a country with rights like ours) but Mr. Moore brings up some very legitimate concerns.\n\nWhen the first plane hit the first Trade Center Tower on September 11th I heard about it on the radio immediately and I remember thinking ""isn't that odd? Maybe somebody was impaired - pilot had a heart attack or something...."" But this report was followed minutes later by the crash into the 2nd Tower and I immediately knew ""this means a terrorist attack of LARGE proportions"".  The President received this word while he was sitting in front of an elementary school class, and I've heard that his explanation for his actions were that he ""didn't want to alarm the children"".  I'm ALL for not alarming children any more than they need to be - but when you're the President and your country is being attacked on a scale that you don't know of yet - I think it's okay to say ""sorry kids, I need to go be President - I know you'll understand""..... or something like that.  Instead, Mr. Bush just sat there - for seven minutes.  Not the ideal response from my Commander-In-Chief.\n\nMr. Moore also makes a pretty convincing argument that ties between Middle Eastern Oil, the Bin Laden family and the White House don't look very good.  Perhaps things are utterly innocent between the Bushes and the Saudi's.... but members of the military are taught to not only do no wrong, but also to not do anything that has even the APPEARANCE of wrongness.  This movie has it's own agenda, but I give Mr. Moore credit for skillfully highlighting the appearance of impropriety.\n\nHis editing and writing are skillful, and he has a real knack for catching folks at inopportune moments.  I like the moment when he is standing across the street from the Saudi embassy - far away from the White House - when the White House Secret Service suddenly pulls up and asking what they're doing there.  Mr. Moore seems to politely say ""we're just here shooting a documentary, and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.... I didn't know that the secret service guards foreign embassies."" ""Not usually"", the secret service guy replies.  ""Do they give you much trouble - the Saudis?"" Michael Moore asks.  ""No comment"" - the officer says.  ""I'll take that as a 'Yes'"", Moore concludes. It couldn't have gone better for Michael Moore if he had staged it himself.\n\nFor those who say ""don't watch this!!!!"" I say: Why not?  It's not obscene. It doesn't threaten national security or my religion.\n\nComing away from this film my thought was ""I'm not certain Mr. Bush is doing the best job that he could as President.""  And I don't feel disrespectful or unpatriotic to want my President to do the best job he (or she!) could.  I remain hopeful - hopeful enough that I still voted for Mr. Bush in the recently completed election.\n\nYou can disagree with Michael Moore.

It also makes, or should make, you think; think if war is necessary or worth it, worth the cost, the chaos, and, most of all, the human suffering.\n\nAlso, being moderatley distrustful or cynical of your government is a healthy thing. It forces you, if you wish to have a good argument, to look the facts up yourself, to learn and make your own opinions, which I hope this film drives people to do.\n\nSo, 4 stars for content and 1 for guts- because now half the country is calling him a fat, stupid, communist...*gasp* LIBERAL!";here goes nothing...
490;448.0;1.0;20.0;I watched this at the invitation of someone who insisted I do so, saying it would convince me Bush was a disaster for the country. What I saw, instead, were Moore's usual diatribes, cleverly constructed to misrepresent the truth. We all know Bush was inexperienced in facing the camera during his early years in office and highly self-conscious about it to boot, all of which tended to make him smirk foolishly at inopportune moments, stumble haltingly over his words and look beseechingly around, as though seeking approval. Often he would pause in mid-sentence, as though painfully aware that his enemies were all around him, waiting for him to blunder. The resultant linguistic hesitancy he evidenced inevitably made Bush blunders a nearly self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nHe came into office without a lot of seasoning and it showed, though he seems to have gained more poise as a result of his nearly four years in office under the relentless fire of a demonstrably partisan media and his equally partisan Democratic opponents. The result of his early lack of seasoning, of course, was that he provided the camera with plenty of footage that made him look and sound kind of dopey. Moore used whatever he could find of this footage, along with some of his own rather ingenious interviews and commentary, to construct a picture of Bush the fool, using innuendo and out-of-context shots to suggest corruption on Bush's part.\n\nSo Moore makes the case that Bush is laughably stupid and, at the same time, cynically conspiratorial. Of course, if he is that stupid how much danger can he present to us as a cynical conspirator? He's either Bozo the Clown or Machiavelli, but he can't be both. (Moore gets around this conundrum by suggesting Bush is really the puppet of other, even more nefarious interests, including the infamous Carlyle Group, an investment company in which his father and James Baker, his father's crony, have interests, and, of course, those sneaky Saudis.)\n\nAdding a number of outright falsehoods for good measure (such as the claim that members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. unquestioned, when other planes were being grounded, immediately after 9/11 . . . definitively shown to be false), Moore shot a film that is highly entertaining but also demeaning to this nation and president. It's regrettable that he has such vitriol for his country or that he is unable to scope out a position of opposition based on fact and reasoned argument. But it's more regrettable that so many today have clambered on board his outrageous propaganda train and see nothing wrong with his distortions and misrepresentations and have even elevated him to a kind of cult icon. Lots of money in it for Moore, I guess, so he has, at the least, found himself another lucrative niche. But I'm sure the money isn't what interests him, right? He's in it for the betterment of society, isn't he, even if that means pushing the level of political discourse down into the gutter.\n\nWell, thankfully, this is all just about over and we'll soon know who the country wants as president for the next four years. Unfortunately the odds are that Michael Moore is unlikely to give up this particularly profitable niche. So brace yourselves for more of the same from the man who told our friends in France that Americans are really stupid.;Utterly Brainless Tripe But Cleverly Compiled
559;449.0;5.0;20.0;In several interviews, director Michael Moore has said that his main objective in making any movie is entertainment -- a film he would like to sit down and watch on a Saturday night.  He has overwhelmingly succeeded with F 9/11, a beautiful picture that is far more cinematic than the political hype gives it credit for.  The narrative is thoughtful, the music harrowing, the construction symbolic.  Every movie has a message -- be it about superheros, a dinosaur park, or aliens.  The fact that Moore's message is about the real world that we live in only makes it a more powerful cinematic experience.;Forget Politics -- A Beautiful Film
600;450.0;1.0;20.0;"I finally saw this supposed masterwork a short time ago. (Like about 45 minutes.)\n\nFirst of all, the movie is downright boring, the last half only shows some interest because of the heart strings being deliberately pulled.\n\nSecondly, think of the story you're being told.  Not oh-my-god Bush is connected to Carlyle or the war is bad message.  Look at the conspiracy theory Moore is showing us.\n\nBush and the Bin Ladens were in cahoots and they decided to ""screw"" Bush with the 9/11 attacks.  Why?  To gain what?  And after this he helps the Bin Ladens get out of the country.  The war in Afghanistan was really a cover to build an oil pipeline, and Iraq was a peaceful and happy place which we invaded for no reason.  There is no war on terror, and no terrorist threat.  We're kept in fear to to keep society together and the ""war"" is only meant to continue.\n\nThat was the message I got from Moore's film, and he can present all the ""facts"" and rich people know rich people innuendo he wants but this is ridiculous.  Has anybody who loves this film actually realized this?  Or does it just give so much they want to hear that the unbelievability just doesn't matter?

642;452.0;4.0;20.0;"Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore is a master showman. His documentaries have always done well at the boxoffice, but ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" proved to be a runaway hit. It will probably be a long, long time before any movie of this type again takes in so much money.\n\nIts success is also a tribute to his abilities as a filmmaker. Many argue that he doesn't play fair, that he's a left-wing nutcase. Others see him as a great essayist who readily admits his works are biased by nature. To me, the fact that he can stir great debate proves that he is ingenious.\n\nWhat makes ""Fahrenheit 9//11"" so controversial is that it takes direct aim at George W. Bush and his administration. It is perhaps the most savagely satirical documentary about a sitting President ever made.\n\nThe opening of the movie makes fun of Bush, who, having learned of the 9/11/2001 terrorists attacks while he visiting a Florida school, sits for a full nine minutes reading a book about a goat to a group of kids. This is an example of the `unfair' Moore. Why should the President be any less stunned by the event than the rest of us? When unreal events occur, it takes awhile for us to adjust to the `new' reality.\n\nWhere the movie really takes hold is later, when Bush and company decides to invade Iraq. People all over the world, including America, asked themselves what this had to do with the war on terror. Moore's point that the invasion was based on an agenda other than fighting terrorism is fascinating. [He zeroes in on the cozy relationship between the Bush family and the rulers of Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 9/11 hijackers.] His focus on the REAL sacrifice of our troops is fascinating. His juxtaposition of our government's assertion that the war is surgical, precise and humane versus the real suffering on the ground in Iraq is brilliant.\n\nIn an era in which all media outlets are controlled by giant corporations, Moore's voice, irritating as it can sometimes be, is refreshing. [Case in point: The movie was to be released originally by feisty Disney subsidiary, Miramax Films. The head of Disney decided that the film was too controversial, reportedly because, at the time, Disney was vying for some tax incentives in the state of Florida, whose governor is Jeb Bush, brother of George W.]";An exceptionally fine example of the documentary genre

I hear it's really biased.""  I wish these folks would smack themselves on the head and realize that administration officials have been feeding everyone THEIR side of the story for three-plus years, so what's WRONG with hearing an opposing view for a lousy TWO HOURS?  I'm not saying you need to agree with every single point Mr. Moore makes here, but what's so crazy about viewing the darned thing once before giving it a blanket dismissal?\n\nJust be warned, viewers may find precious little to refute in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", as Mr. Moore makes so many of his points by simply letting the president speak for himself, via the ample newsclips that were assembled for the film.  One of my favorites is the quote in the subject line, which Mr. Bush delivered to a roomful of fat-cat campaign contributors during a lavish fundraising dinner.  Actually, the entire quote is even more revealing: ""Ah, the haves and have-mores... some people call you the elite... I call you my base.""  And not only does the quote confirm Mr. Moore's assertions about who the president is truly ""for"", but it also raises (yet again!) questions about the leader of the free world's mental agility, in that he actually allowed those comments to be videotaped!\n\nBut, hey, if you still need another reason to watch this movie, it's also very, very funny in places.  And, of all forms of humor, political humor is always particularly fun, isn't it?  Also, the humor gives one occasional breaks from the serious, heart-rending, and tragic moments in the film, which I have to be honest and say are also here in abundance.\n\nThat's it for now.

It has never been this polarized. Those that manage the information flow are working overtime to silence or discredit the other side. Despite any negative things that can be said about this movie, here are the things that are true:\n\n* A lot of the information in the movie is very valuable because the press wouldn't touch it out of fear of reprisal.\n\n* NONE of the information in the movie HAS BEEN DEBUNKED. Period. There are plenty of radical attack sites with a bunch of strawman arguments, but NONE of them have actually disproven a single fact in the movie.\n\n* Even a staunch Conservative (such as myself) will be very moved by this movie unless they are so blinded by rhetoric that they don't want to challenge their worldview.\n\n* You can't argue with the footage. It's there. You see it.\n\n* The movie is a rollercoaster of sometimes funny, sometimes very sad, and sometimes over the top scenes. At times it will make you angry if you have a heart beating in your chest.\n\n* Much like the recent Presidential debate, there are scenes that simply make you shake your head, close your eyes, and just feel really sorry for our President. It got so bad at one point I almost had to stop watching. It's the kind of eye-opener that is necessary, but it doesn't make it any easier.\n\n* The soldiers are the real stars of the movie. They steal it. As much as I dislike Moore, I have to thank him for showing our soldiers the way they really are. It made me proud.\n\n* It's doubtful the movie is going to change your mind on much. If anything, it's an entertaining look behind the curtain covering the corridors of power. We ALL know that the Gov't does things they can't tell us about, and can't always be straight with us on the reasons behind reasons. You don't have to fear that you'll turn into a bleeding heart tree kisser with berkenstocks or whatever just by seeing this movie, unless you are truly worried you are that easily manipulated.\n\nHowever......\n\nThere is definitely Mr. Moore's spin on things. I almost wish at points you could turn off his commontary and just watch the raw footage to draw your own conclusions. It's very easy to decide which parts of his dialog to pay less attention to. And to be fair, at certain parts there is only ONE conclusion to make, and he nails perfectly. This movie should be seen by anyone planning to vote this year. Oh, and it has a very impressive soundtrack as well. Although he doesn't give equal time to bashing the Democrats, he does do it often in the film and doesn't hold back. If anything, this movie made me respect Mr. Moore enough that I'm starting to add his work to my library so I can gain the benefit of an alternate perspective. I'm STILL voting the way I had planned, but I'm paying much closer attention now. This movie accomplished what it set out to do, and more. That's why I give it a perfect score. At one point in the movie, our President tells Mr. Moore to his face ""Hey Mike, GET A REAL JOB!"". It made me see a different side of our President that I hadn't seen before, and made me laught out loud. You see a human side of our President. Definitely a good show.";Not for the biased at heart.

What this film did for me was show me with supportive facts how our president is much more inclined towards accruing power and money for himself over peace and fairness for the rest of us.\nThis film was a shock to my system... not because of any one thing I hadn't heard necessarily or couldn't deduce from a pattern of slimy practices (on behalf of said president), but from a well-done montage of the whole (including daddy-president's avarice) from Michael Moore's thought-provoking and courageous commitment to the truth.\nSeeing the damage this President (I happen to have an aversion to his name; I think you understand) and his daddy have inflicted upon the poorest of this country makes me furious. When the military is  looked at as the only upwardly mobile occupation in your area (poor Lila Lispscomb) then we have real problems (I served in the military so I know). And when we have a tyrannical commander in thief who is all too eager to endanger American boys for fattening his pocketbook (how THIS president is not impeached for lying to us about WMD and a former president IS impeached for lying about some cum-stains is beyond me) and then strip away more of our hard-fought freedoms with the so-called ""Patriot Act"" is just maddening beyond desription. Could someone please explain to me the difference between what Saddam did to Kuwait and what we did to Iraq? Please?!\nI came away from this film feeling angry at first (yes, even more than I am now) and then very sad for so many Americans who deserve better than watching their children try to make it out of ""slums"" only to become more fresh meat for the military.\nI'm afraid another four years with this president the American dream will be turned into even more of a night-mare for folks who are running out of options just to survive...never-mind the steeper slope this country now finds itself moving towards... a Totalitarian regime.\nAnd where's our media in all of this? Bunch of friggen sissy's!";Just plain scary
1335;475.0;4.0;20.0;"In at least one sense, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" lived up to some of the expectations I had for it. Moore stretches facts to their absolute limit, and sometimes a little beyond that, in order to make a point. Occasionally his ""factual"" points are revelatory, but more often they come off as manipulative, and sometimes disingenuous. Dates are fudged, opinions are stated as fact, and connections are made from the most tenuous of relationships. There's smoke here, to be sure, but sometimes it's hard to tell who's fanning the flames.\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is whether Moore is using these techniques of manipulation as a subtle play on the tactics of the Bush Administration. There should be no question, at this point, that Moore is a talented filmmaker who knows what he is doing. Among his many talents is that of satire. It occurred to me, while watching Moore stretch the truth at several points in the film, that he was using essentially the same tactics to prove his points that the Bush Administration has used to ""sell"" America on the war in Iraq and the terror threat in America. I'm no apologist for Moore, but I have to at least consider the possibility that in adopting the same accusation-by-implication, fact-stretching tactics as the Bush Administration has adopted time and again, he may be going for a deliberate parody of them. Moore is just talented enough to try to pull that off, but if he's doing so, he's playing it awfully straight.  I'm frankly not sure myself if Moore intended these points as stylistic satire or serious, but satirical or not, these are the weak points of the film.\nWhat I did not expect, and what I was most impressed by as I thought about the movie well after it was over, was the surprisingly powerful emotional wallop that the film packs. A short sequence early on, in which the sounds of planes crashing and general chaos are played over a black screen, comprises one of the most powerful depictions of the 9/11 attacks I have ever experienced. The faces afterwards, looking up in fear and wonder and shock, bring tears to the eyes. Brutally honest images of the wounded and the dead in Iraq, both Iraqi and American, bring a new perspective to the sanitized version of the war most of us have seen so far. The point-counterpoint juxtaposition of graphic wartime images with Britney Spears saying ""we should just trust the President"" while snapping her gum elicits an inescapably visceral reaction, embodied in a loudly-uttered expletive from the general direction of my seat and general groans from the audience around me. The lighter parts of the film made me laugh, but it was often a sort of incredulous laugh. Much of what was presented was funny because of the way Moore presented it, but in ways it was not funny at all. The shame I felt in watching senators get increasingly nervous and evasive as Moore asked if they would send their sons and daughters to fight in Iraq took me by surprise, and the empathy for the palpable, deeply-felt grief of a mother who had lost her son in Iraq was absolutely undeniable. Thinking of her loss and her sorrow, even now, brings the sharp sting of tears to my eyes once again.\nThe moving coda to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not a screed against Bush, but rather a tribute to the American men and women fighting in Iraq today, many of whom are there because they had very few other choices. Moore is saying that it is the least of us who are doing the fighting for all of us. He points out the imbalance inherent in this, and in doing so shows how these young men and women deserve our respect. More, they demand it. When, at the end of the film, we see that it is dedicated to those lost on 9/11 and to the soldiers lost in the Iraq war, we know that Moore is sincere in this.\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is at its best when it is at its most honest. The pain of the wounded and the brutality of the dead on the battlefield are real. The grief of a mother whose son is dead is real. The fear and the sadness we all felt on 9/11, and still feel when reminded of it, is real. This film evokes all of those emotions far more powerfully than I thought it could, and it is a credit to Moore that he had the talent to recognize when to let these stories tell themselves.\nIs the film manipulative? To be sure, it is. Is it disingenuous, maybe even somewhat dishonest? In parts, yes... but I reiterate that this may be intentional on Moore's part, intended as a satirical jab at similar Bush Administration tactics of exaggeration and obfuscation. Is it likely to change many people's minds about how they feel about Bush or the war in Iraq? I'd like to think that the film was the sort of tactical nuke required to shake people out of the trenches they have dug for themselves in our increasingly-divisive culture, but I know its not very likely. The film's weaknesses prevent it from being that effective.\nIs ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" nevertheless an important film which has a great deal to say about the America and the world we find ourselves in today? You're darn right it is.";The Temperature At Which America Burns?

1391;477.0;5.0;20.0;Granted, Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very controversial movie covering the most sensitive historic events and political topics significant in the early 21st century America. So for the sake of objectiveness, let's not judge it by the message it conveys or the method of how it conveys, just some facts and observations of my movie-going experience:\nI went to the local theatre early Saturday (June 26) thinking I could avoid the usual crowd on the public nation wide release day (June 25), but I found all 4 screens were sold out for the entire day! - totally unheard of for a documentary. I had to go early to the very first show on Sunday morning and fought to get one of the again sold out seats. During the 2-hour run of the movie, the packed theatre was filled with audiences' reactive sounds - laughter, sighs, curses, weeps, cries, sometime tears in the eyes not sure from previous laughter or the next weep. In the end, there was this long standing ovation with the loudest clapping of hands. I `m on average a twice-in-a-week moviegoer and I have never seen this kind of reaction to a movie in years.\nSo I suggest to go see this movie, you will enjoy the emotional roller coaster ride as you've never experienced before, regardless of your political stand - You will be guaranteed to laugh, to cry, and to be angry (either toward Bush or toward Moore, depends on your stand). And you will see why it won the best film in Cannes - it is not because of people's hatred of American foreign policy, it is because of people's love of American movie making.\nIn the year of 2004, you could vote for either Bush or Kerry for your love of the country, but you must watch this ONE and only movie for your love of freedom, democracy, and the cinema art.;Unprecedented history, unprecedented film

Of course I knew the Demeocrats' thesis on Bush's first election and the war in Iraq but I decided to see Michael Moore's film when it became clear that Iraq has been turned into a quagmire for the US Army, draining its resources and killing and maiming its volunteer personnel. The film was a nice surprise. It uses plain language and very well selected scenes, it avoids the silly conspiracy theories, presents only the facts and gives voice to some of the US soldiers who served in Iraq. The most moving part of the film is the middle-aged woman who was very patriotic and proud of the US military and then suddenly lost the ground under her feet when her son was killed in Iraq. The grave mistakes of the ""neocons"" team and the underestimation of the Iraqi insurgency is just showing up in full force.

His most recent, F. 9/11, as one reviewer said, this is his homage to Joseph Goebles.... and the film lady, Leni Reifenstadt(sp). Moore basically states in his film that the Bushes are in league with the arab oil merchants, I suppose to eventually own and rule the world. The implied conspiracies ramble on like some asteroid hurling towards earth to a quick and sudden demise of all humanity. If Moore had worked on Oliver Stone's ""JFK"", there would have been twenty gunmen on the grassy knoll, and car bombs exploding nearby to kill all the witnesses, with a teenage George Bush calling Jack Ruby to do ""his thing"". It's unfortunate that society, even the conspiracy nuts, have to be exposed to a humorless, sour,untruthful, unpleasant movie like Fahrenheit 9/11.

This disturbs me for three reasons:\n\n1. It means you have too much time on your hands and you have nothing better to do than write a negative review and waste space on Amazon.\n\n2. Or this means the people who do it are suffering from paranoia and equate Michael Moore with the boogeyman and they fear him so much that they need to write negative reviews about every single product of his without even reading it or seeing it.\n\n3.

For a bunch of people so apparently resolute on spreading the joy of ""freedom"" throughout the world, it's odd to see conservatives getting so enraged when an American exercises a bit of it at home. Sure, you might disagree with Moore's views. Sure, you might accuse him of presenting only one side of the story. But go make your own movie. Isn't that what a free press is all about? I'm sure you won't have trouble getting financial backing or a distribution deal. Fox News runs equally biased, equally risible ""news"" every day. I rarely agree with most of what Moore says, but I adore the fact that he says it and the way he goes about the task. His work is both a consequence and a cause of a truly functional democracy. Look at what it's achieved - people are finally talking about the issues; they're wondering if what Moore says is true; they're doing their own research and making up their own minds. If the conservatives are right, then truth will out and they'll be justified - so what have they got to worry about? If the conservatives are lying, then truth will out - and they'll get what they deserve. That's the way it's meant to work, even in Florida. So what's the problem? Moore isn't anti-American, he's simply anti the abuse of power. For my money, that makes him a true patriot. Like Gore Vidal, Moore sees the difference between the American Republic, and the American Global Empire which is its most dangerous enemy - and until conservative Americans learn to separate the flag, the Presidency and moral righteousness, and see that unthinking worship of any one of them can be used as a smokescreen for the debasement of the others, then the fear of seeming ""unpatriotic"" will be used to frighten and manipulate Americans to whatever ends those in power choose. I'm simultaneously delighted and disgusted by the existence of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"": delighted that America is still a nation where a citizen can mount this kind of attack on the government and live to tell the tale, and disgusted that the Presidency has been dragged to such depths by the Bush-Cheney junta that a wildly accusatory film like this is needed as a corrective. And as far as the claim that this is ""propaganda"" is concerned - sure it is, but give me a break ... conservatives still stroking their decks of ""Iraq's Most Wanted"" playing cards have lost all right to that claim.";What's all the fuss about?

However, as a filmmaker, and with a bit of research, it is a no brainier that this movie needs to be dismissed as a factual movie.\n\nI could go through the whole movie to point out how the art of editing was used to manipulate footage so that it would align with a point of view, but I'll only use two examples for the sake of time.\n\nExample 1:\n\nMoore showed us a crass statement from Bush that said: ""Some people call you the elite, I call you my base"" as he stood there among a bunch of rich folks, despite that the uncropped shot of that speech showed that Bush was sitting next to Al Gore at that fundraiser, not for a campaign, but for a children's hospital where they raised 10 million for the charity.\n\nExample 2:\n\nMoore uses the article from the Washington Post about bush spending 42% of his first seven month on vacation. Those 42%, as it reported in the Washington Post, include weekends, time traveled for presidential engagements, and time spent with foreign leaders at Camp David.\n\nManipulation of footage was pretty much throughout the movie.

532;498.0;5.0;19.0;"Michael Moore reinvents the pamphlet which is a genre that has widely been practised for centuries, but generally in writ (books or the press), and eventually on the radio. Michael Moore develops the genre by using the cinema as the medium carrying the pamphlet. He is able to use all possibilities offered by this medium : images, sounds, and even some special effects, but particularly elliptical editing that builds some striking and even shocking clashes between shots. This is very dynamic and effective to impress the public and to tune them to the discourse. Then he applies this mature technique to his subject to prove that George W. Bush is problematic as the President of the US for three reasons : his personality which seems to be shifting from one extreme to another and his obsession about Saddam Hussein ; the motivations and objectives of his team that seems to be aiming at only one target which is to strengthen the control of society by the state and its various agencies, and finally the dubious and non-transparent relations with the Saudis and the Ben Ladens, including his personal or family business relations with these. The objective of the documentary is to cast some doubt in the minds of the viewers about the facts and mottos that are ceaselessly repeated if not hammered in all media by all the members of this team of politicians. Finally the pamphlet insists on the very particular relations between the members of this team, first of all the President and the Vice President, with some private corporations that are making a tremendous amount of profit out of the Irak war. This is systematically contrasted with the very emotional interviews of some GIs and some parents of victims, both Iraki and American. All that makes a very strong pamphlet that will outlive the events it has been made for, the US presidential election in 2004, because of the great use of the cinema technology and techniques.

Yes, members of the bin Laden family were flown home 2 days after 9/11, with nothing more than a cursory passport check.  Yes, Bush really did waste 7 minutes while the country was under attack, wearing a stupid, deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression, while a grade school class read ""My Pet Goat"" and people died horribly in NYC. (He didn't want to frighten the children, he said.  He wanted to project calm.  What do most of you do during a crisis?  Do you deal with it directly, perhaps staving off more harm, or do you sit motionless, befuddled,  wondering what to do, while poor souls jump out windows of 100-story buildings rather than burn alive?) Yes, the Bush family really does have very strong ties and interests in keeping the Saudis happy.

Hoping to help other loyal, concerned Americans bring the Bush Administration to a hardly untimely end on January 20, 2005, Moore documents the perfidious nature of the crooks and warmongers who have misgoverned us since the Supreme Court stabbed us in the back after the 2000 Election.\n\nThe movie begins with the last, triumphant days of the Al Gore Campaign as it swept toward victory in November of 2000.  Moore then documents the shenanigans and insider dealings which produced the Florida fiasco and installed Bush and Company in the White House.  Moore does an especially brilliant job of documenting the sleazy tactics and underhandedness of W and his milieu, which includes some of the smarmiest people in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nNext, Moore shows us W. on September 11, 2001, sitting with a glazed look on his face as his world began to crumble.  Moore demonstrates that far from being the courageous, calm leader Republican propagandists portray, W. in the days and weeks after September 11 was more of a pawn than a king.\n\nThe most powerful parts of Fahrenheit 911 deal with the tragic war in Iraq in all its bloody details, details that the US media has never had the stomach to show us but which are essential to our understanding of exactly what our government is committing in our names. Moore also shows us exactly which Americans are doing the fighting and dying:  not the privileged sorts who run the government, but the poorest and saddest among us.\n\nFahrenheit 911 is a muckraker's delight.  It claws away our illusions and demonstrates that the Emperor has no clothes and that our ""gods"" have feet of clay.";Michael Moore Punctures the Bush Balloon

Too funny.  I saw it in the theater and didn't think I needed to see it again but all these lunatic fringe, right wing illiterates campaigning so vehemently against it have caused me to re-evaluate my position.

890;510.0;5.0;19.0;Moore's expos of the corruption and incompetence of the Bush administration may be a bit of a shock to those who depend on the corporate media for their news, but it is mostly accurate, although some minor details are omited or blurred (Moore mentions that Bush sat dumbfounded in the classroom for 7 minutes after being informed of the attacks, and the video of him sitting was indeed 7 minutes, but the timeline of the day shows that Bush stayed at the school for over 30 minutes after Card informed him of the attack, putting himself and all the kids in the school in unnecessary danger.  Anyway, the film is at times humorous, often moving, and truly patriotic.\n\nFor progressives and political junkies, this flick will not show you anything you don't already know, but it will give you an entertaining look at what is in fact a pretty grim administration.;A Great Film for the Layman...

Among these ""truths"" Moore reveals is the assinine assumption that the war in Afghanistan was not fought because the Taliban was harboring bin Laden and al-Qaeda but because the Unocal Oil Company wanted to run a natural gas pipeline from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea. Of course, Unocal has headquarters in Texas, George W. Bush's home state. The United States had to invade Afghanistan before Iraq to make this profit-making venture a sucess.\n\nMoore also depicts Iraq as a land of peace and joy (children laughing and playing, flying kites, etc.) Michael Moore neglects to show the dead children gassed by Saddam's forces, or Iraq's mass graves, or the torture videos, etc.\n\nMoore insists he's reporting facts- but when you only supply a part of the facts- well, it isn't really the truth, is it?\n\nIf you'd like a bipartisan depiction of 9/11, read the Commission Report.\n\nIf you want cheap, unreliable, dishonest fodder to ""Bush-bash""- this is your film...";Michael Moore is a STUPID fat white man....

Duh, like what is the Amazon.com reviewer suggesting? That anyone who regards Moore's film as a pack of lies doesn't ""truly"" know what it means to be an American? He's probably one of those idiots who believe that anyone who questions the ""facts"" of Moore's films are suggesting he didn't have the right to make it. He had the right to make it, and we have the right to criticize it and to criticize him. That's called freedom of speech, but the Amazon.com reviewer probably regards it as censorship. Get a dictionary, you damn fool!\n\nSpace is limited, too limited to counter Moore's film point by point, but I wouldn't do that anyway. I've read reams of articles about both the film and Moore's other works (including his books) and anyone interested in knowing the truth can get off their lazy behinds and do the same. The fact is the man cannot be trusted, and even those who share his political idealogy know he's a fraud and condemn him for it. Moore discredits the very people who champion him with his lazy and/or inept research, and his all too obvious lies.\n\nMoore is an overgrown child with a blind hatred for authority figures. This film is nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of an incorrigible twelve year old giving his teacher the finger to win the admiration of his classmates. Moore's hatred of George W. Bush may even stem from the fact that the Bush family was instrumental in getting Moore's filmmaking career off the ground (read the story on Moore in the current - as of this writing - Rolling Stone). He now bites the hand that fed him, perhaps because he resents his indebtedness to them.\n\nTo those of you who blindly accept what Moore says, learn to think for yourselves. Moore is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and he'll devour you and your pet causes, not George W. Bush.\n\nOn top of all that, the film is shoddy. The guy can't make a competent film, yet he's an Oscar winning filmmaker. He's a mediocre writer, yet he's a bestselling author.

As it were, Moore uses a twisted premise (Bush is evil and he is worse than any terrorist) and takes the audience through his ""logic"" in hopes of having them arrive at the same conclusion. The problem with this movie that it leaves out too many fact to justify Moore's rediculous conjecture.\n\nAlthough he tries to convice us that we went to Afghanistan for an oil pipeline, he fails to see that after all this time, there is STILL NO PIPELINE and there are no plans to build one.\n\nHis Halliburton conspiracyare also overdone. It's true that Halliburton was given a no-bid contract to help with oil operations in Iraq, but Bill Clinton gave Halliburton an identical no-bid contract to go into Bosnia and rebuilt the oil infrastructure there.\n\nHe tries to connect the Bushes with the bin Ladens by showing that members of both families have investments in the Carlyle group. Once again, his attempt at logic falls short. In fact, one of the largest investors in the Carlyle group is George Soros, who is one of the major backers of MoveOn. Org, an avowed enemy of the Bush administration.\n\nAll in all, Moore's attempt to convince us that Bush is evil just comes off as too emotional and not cerebral enough.";Full of half-truths and lies.

Career: Movie Director;Who's Smarter?
1049;523.0;1.0;19.0;Moore is making money off of September 11th. This is also not his first movie to distort the facts.\n\n[...];Moore is a liar.
1232;524.0;4.0;19.0;"I am a wife, mother of four, college-educated professional, and ex-welfare recipient (three desperate years spent struggling to GET OFF welfare, resume independence, and regain dignity) who by virtue of a previous marriage to a drug addict has likely seen more of the underside of society and politics than many in my demographic classification. I don't consider myself a fanatic, but am known for calling a spade what it is.  This being said, I agree for the most part with ""a customer (France)"" in that Fahrenheit 9/11 probably was not the most objective documentary I've ever viewed.  However, it did contain compelling questions that I don't believe should be ignored by any responsible voting American.\nThe answers that Mr. Moore suggests to these questions don't hold as much importance to me in the grand scheme of things as they seem to for other reviewers. Instead, I believe that the questions raised by Moore in his film MUST be asked and answered by (and to the satisfaction of) ALL Americans, if they are to be honest about their futures, their country, and its leaders.  Running from the answers in blind loyalty to party politics does all of us a disservice -- it's not about who supports whom or what kind of man Michael Moore is.  To me, it's really about what kind of leadership and future you want for your family and its progeny.\nTo clarify for the French reviewer: in my opinion, the emotional scenes did not weaken the message for many American viewers who are compelled to send their sons and daughters to fight for a war that, according to Moore and many others, doesn't seem to have a purpose that would benefit the average American citizen.  (I will admit my bias, since I have three children who are likely candidates for military participation.)  The mother in the film began by expressing her loyalty to US leaders and their decisions, and considerable screen time elapsed before she began to give any indication that she wasn't gung-ho for the cause.  It is my belief that part of her tears might be *because* of that loyalty and trust -- she literally gave her son to a cause that, if one believes the assertions in this film, was in large part misrepresented and in all likelihood, unnecessary.  (Well, some folks may think it was ""necessary,"" but this mother made the ultimate sacrifice to test the validity of that assertion.)\nAt the outset of the US invasion of Iraq, my eighteen-year-old son, who lives on his own, attends college part-time and works full-time, was very pro-war.  He carefully listened to the reports emanating from the media and read voluminously about the causes of, revelations and  discoveries involving, politics surrounding, etc. the war for many weeks, then months.  Each time I visited with him, his outlook regarding the whole scenario seemed to gradually change.  Today he is no longer in favor of the invasion, war, or occupation.  Now, my son is barely old enough to vote, but the war in Iraq is very relevant to him, and because of this, he continues to research all aspects of it.  I respect his viewpoints not because I agree with them, but because he has taken the initiative to look at all sides of the issue and draw reasonable conclusions.\nPerhaps Mr. Moore does not present an unbiased look at the issues he presents; very few filmmakers do, after all.  However, it isn't necessary to rip Moore's character to shreds in order for viewers to gather what I feel is the the message and essence of the movie: there are serious problems in the way the American people allow themselves to be treated by their leaders.  Rather than let Moore outrage us, I think it would be more productive to direct our outrage at the appropriate recipients.";Name one person who has no agenda.

The interviews with soldiers stationed in Iraq are saddening and chilling. Talking with Lila Lipscomb is also a heart-rending experience.

1344;532.0;5.0;19.0;"For one, Michael Moore brings out the truth like he always does. Now personally I dislike Bush for a lot of reasons, and this movie makes me dislike Bush more and more. Michael Moore digs deep into this film. First it takes the sounds of what happen on 9/11, and he moves forward when Bush was governor, he actually had the Taliban come to Texas to talk to them about running a oil pipeline through Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Bush had them in five-star hotel's and he gave them the good life when they were in Texas. Now the Prime Minister of the Taliban was confronted by a female reporter asking him why did the Taliban treat women like the low scum of the earth wearing the burqua. He replied 'i don't know how your husband puts up with you.' Michael Moore then talks to senators about the Patriot Act; it turns out that the politicians the people elected DONT READ THE DAMN BILLS! They claimed that it would take too long to read the bills and slow down the democratic process.\n Michael Moore then shows the BIG ties between the Bush family and the Saudi house in Saudi Arabia. It turns out that when Bush was given a company; Arbusto is one of them, it failed, but the Saudi Royal family gave him HUGE amounts of money to bring the company out of the pit's. They also paid huge amounts for his Presidential bid in 2000, and 2004. Also Bush was close to the Bin Laden family too. They gave him money for school and the failed businesses he ran. Then the family STILL has close ties to Al Qaida and the world's most wanted man Osama Bin Laden. The Bin Laden family claim that they disown Bid Laden and have no ties to him. Lie. They still give him money, and he still has close ties with his family. Then it goes back to the video were Bush was reading to the school kids on 9/11, when his advisor's told him that America was under attack, HE DID NOTHING! He sat there for 17 minutes waiting for someone to tell him what to do. He was not escorted by the Secret Service, and no one came to him. He was out there and thinking 'Oh my God, they told me it was going to happen and it did. I am in so much s*it right now.' He was clueless! Then Bush had the balls to go to Ground Zero and tried to portray himself as the hero as the men and women searched for survivors at Ground Zero. Then he waited three weeks to go to war with Afghanistan. He knew where the terrorist network was when he came into office by Richard Clarke. Then when the war in Afghanistan wound down and people got less interested in it, he went to go fight Saddam in Iraq. He scared the American people to believe that Saddam was behind 9/11, and that he harbored terrorist. So we went to war, and almost 900 soldiers have died fighting the insurgency and being killed by Islamic extremist and saying that America is much more safer now that Saddam was in a jail cell. Then Michael Moore decided to talk to senators to send their kids to Iraq, since they sent thousands of brothers, daughters, son's, friends, husband's, wives to Iraq, so why not send the senators kids to Iraq since they sent soldiers to fight for oil?  This movie is very strong, and there is some violence in this film. There is the decapating of head's in Saudi Arabia, there is a shot where this boy's arm is blown off, and there is this one scene where this mother lost her son in Iraq, and has gone as close to the White House as possible to give Mr. Bush a piece of her mind. This film is very strong, and one of the best documentary's I have seen so far. I smell another Oscar for Michael Moore.";Igonre all the bashing for this film....

1447;535.0;5.0;19.0;There were many reasons why America needed a film like Farenheit 9/11 but I didn't expect one of them to be its rumoured censorship. As a non-American, who has always been impressed by the degree to which America defends its rights, I am amazed. HOW CAN AMERICANS ACCEPT THIS? It gives the impression that they are spending their lives asleep.\nWhat Michal Moore has assembled in this film is a unique collage of perspectives regarding contemporary Amercian history and politics. Some have called it demagoguery, I think it would be more aptly called an expos. Moore supports his claims with such eye-popping, authentic documents, that people lean forward in their cinema seats to examine them, almost in disbelief and even when Moore has already projected them at a high level of magnification.\nTake for example one of Bush's war record documents. Moore not only has the unclassified copy, but he also exhibits the classified one. Another eye popper is the official list of Saudi nationals who are secretly transported out of the States on September 13th, a day on which all flights were supposed to have been grounded. This is confirmed by a government official. Another document illustrates a business deal in which a Bush family member is financially involved with a bin Laden family member.\nNot one to go half way, Moore has candy not only for the eyes. Often through the film, I notced the audience was dead silent. People were concentrating mightily on what was being said. One example is a large business meeting where a fellow with a thick accent tells a room full of businessmen that there is lots and lots of money to be made from this war.\nIt's not unusual for wars to provide boosts to economies, but the eager, almost hand rubbing look of contractors moving in to profit from blood and destruction explains much better than Moore can in his own words, the reason why so much attention has been and is being focused on Iraq: it is the #2 oil producer in the world.\nWhile documents and interviews make good support for documentary, Michael Moore does not settle for soundbites alone. Several powerful interviews are revisited through the film and American soldiers give some astonishing insights but the most poignant message in this film comes from an interview with the mother, Lila Lipscombe, of a recently kiiled American soldier. (I'm embarrassed and sorry I'm can't exaclty recall what his first name is.). Whether we're hearing her, or her husband speak we still get the same impression: these are good, decent, back bone of America people who simply want to know why the killing is necessary, and who sympathize and empathize with the suffering and grieving of others. You might  form different opinions about Michael Moore, but when it comes to this family you cant help but do one thing: share their pain.\nWhat I came to realize after watching this film is the difference between Michael Moore and George Bush. Bush believes that people who criticize him are criticizing America while Michael Moore knows that criticism of Bush has nothing to do with the Office of the President or the American people, it is simply a democratic response to Bush's policies and actions, which in Moore's mind are dubious.\nThe most important notion expressed in this film comes at its close. Moore states, over an enigmatic image that, in our world,  there is a specific, entrenched socio-political structure that exists and the only way we are going to make progress as a society is to overcome our ignorance and engage in democracy as responsible citizens. That's not the exact wording, but thats what I took from it.\nI strongly urge you to see it and consider his assertions. There are the occasional corny\nsend-up, along with harrowing war footage, the likes of which CNN seems loathe to broadcast. Yet ultimately, Moore's story is an authentic American one, that does not belong to him, but is being told through him and in his style. A tapestry that is part parody, part imitation of popular American culture, and part plain narrative.\nIt is to Moore's credit that the film is effective not simply as pop entertainment that tugs regularly at emotions, but also as a tragedy in which we are all implicated. Even before I left this film, I felt quite a gamut of emotions, one of them being shame for my lack of action to try and stop this invasion during which so many civilians needlessly suffered or died, and during which much of the country has been razed.\nMy impression by the end of the film is that the country of Iraq has been reduced to ruins, like a wrongfully  convicted criminal , as the jackals have moved in to pave the way for its exploitation.;The new standard
1466;536.0;4.0;19.0;I've been convoluted over my vote for Pres. Bush in 2000 for lots of reasons. Mainly the hypocritical double standards from my conservative brethren that bombards my sense of fairness on a daily basis. Just contemplating the rage, furor, and media coverage over the Clintons sexual indiscretions, missing files (that eventually turned up and then exonerated), a land deal that went bad, etc. and compare them to the dozens and dozens of far more disturbing and destructive scandals from The Bush Administration and the lack of negative coverage until this year...\nI felt compelled to see this film and decide for myself and I must say my present feeling with the President I voted for and felt so proud of in the weeks following Sept. 11 were confirmed. Moores partisan commentary is definitely over the top but there's no denying the content of this film. As a self described Patriot in the spirit of Samuel Adams I say Enough! We can no longer sit by while President Bush creates a rage of anti-American hate in millions of young destitute Arabs, who will grow-up, and in 15 years be the new and improved BinLadden army of terrorists.

197;538.0;1.0;18.0;One of Moore's main points is that the Bin Laden family was ushered out of the country after 9/11. Then, he goes on to treat Richard Clarke like a celebrity guest, the very man who approved the Bin Laden's to leave!\n\n(...)Great Americans have always been those who exercize discretion for their country when also exercizing their freedoms. Just because you have the right to be a swindling jerk doesn't mean you should be celebrated or are patriotic for it. Nobody is saying Moore is un-American because he speaks. They say it becaue of what he says.\n\nIt's truly reprehensible that Moore reaps profit from a film that positions himself to be the spokesperson for the troops. Troops who, the majority of, are supportive of Bush and certainly the mission.\n\nThe Democrats would really do themselves a favor to regain some dignity and distance themselves from such characters. I recomend that, if you must watch this film, make it productive.

42;539.0;5.0;16.0;"I used to be a Conservative Republican. I voted for George Bush in 2000. I used to think Michael Moore was a big fat, disgustiung ogre who had a chip on his shoulder against President Bush.  Watching him up there on the stage at the Oscars giving his acceptance speech in 2003 enraged me at the time. But one year after the Iraq war, things started coming unraveled that would change my faith in the GOP and give this movie an honest look.\n\nMore and more, I started hearing about bad intelligence.  One was the fact that Iraq had ""NO"" weapons of mass destruction, as alleged by the Bush Administration.  Intelligence made up by the CIA had us believing Hussein was manufacturing Uranium in the African country of Niger.  That intelligence was rebuked by PBS's Frontline story, ""The Dark Side"" and lead to the outing of CIA agent, Valerie Plame by Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, L. ""Scooter"" Libby.  Another was the fact that the Patriot Act was ""NEVER"" scrutinized when it was passed.  This was information I already knew prior to watching this film.  Democrats never stood up and questioned the blatant violation of the First Ammendment for fear of being, ""Unpatriotic"".  But what put me over the edge was the fact that Saddam Hussein was made a scapegoat to coverup the Bin-Laden/Bush linkage.\n\nI sincerely wonder if the Administration knew about 9/11 and did nothing to stop it.  There are so many questions that Michael Moore asked in this film that were never asked by the mainstream press (FOX, CNN,NBC, ABC, CBS). That leads me to believe that either Americans are dumb or just plain stupid for not questioning anything.  Judging from the results of the 2004 election, Americans have only themselves to blame for this debacle for not getting rid of the problem.  Me included!\n\nWhatever your feelings on Michael Moore, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Take the name ""Moore"" out of the mix and imagine it was made by someone else.  At least get both sides of the story and make a honest judgement on President George W. Bush and his decisions.";"""Fool Me Once, Shame On You!  Fool Me Twice..."""
222;540.0;5.0;18.0;"""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is one of those films, like Michael Moore's earlier ""Bowling for Columbine"" and Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" that polarizes audiences along political lines.  If you like George W. Bush, chances are you'll hate ""Fahrenheit 9/11;"" if you can't stand Bush, you'll probably love it.  There's little room for middle ground in today's sharply divided American electorate.\n\nMany critics of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" claim the film is factually inaccurate. However, very few details of the film have actually been refuted. What really angers many about this film is its premise: that Bush ignored the threat of terror before the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and then used the attacks as an excuse to advance a radical right-wing agenda that included an ill-advised invasion of Iraq (which had no involvement in the September 11 bombings).\n\nNot exactly a cut-and-dried documentary, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is more of an essay film that relies on documentary footage to underscore Moore's hypothesis.  The footage and facts are expertly woven into a devastating indictment of Bush's policies.  You may disagree with the way Moore connects the dots, but his evidence does come from the public record (including actual quotes from Bush and his administration).\n\nFor all the political weight it carries, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is entertaining as heck.  Most of the comedy occurs in the film's first half.  There are montages of Bush vacationing to (you guessed it) the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" and of Bush Sr. schmoozing with Saudis to REM's ""Shiny Happy People.""  Moore examines the ""Coalition of the Willing,"" finding that our allies include ""superpowers"" like Pulau, The Netherlands, and Costa Rica. (My favorite line: ""Afghanistan? ...Oh, yeah. They had an army. OUR army!"") Moore also milks the Patriot Act for laughs, hijacking an ice cream truck to announce its provisions to members of Congress (who admit they didn't actually read it).\n\nAs events draw nearer to the invasion of Iraq, the tone grows darker, and Moore gradually dispenses with humour in order to focus on the story of military mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son goes to serve in the war.  Moore's delicate, sensitive handling of Lipscomb's heartbreaking story belies his reputation for guerilla filmmaking.\n\nNear the end of the film, Moore offers this profound observation about our troops: ""They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us again?""  Unfortunately, conservatives refused to address this and other valid questions raised by ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", instead focusing on discrediting Moore himself.  They must have felt vindicated when Bush narrowly won reelection in 2004.  But the election results do not invalidate the hypothesis of Moore's film.  Rather, as our troops remain in Iraq, as American casualties mount, and as Bush's rationale for war fades into obscurity, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" remains all too relevant.";Burning Bush
243;541.0;1.0;18.0;I'm against the Iraq war as Michael Moore obviously is. However, I object to his using people's grief for its shock value. Doesn't he have any shame?

109;542.0;5.0;17.0;"Since copies of ""Farenheit 9/11"" are available inexpensively, I've been buying extra copies and giving them out to co-workers, second-hand stores, and to US troops serving overseas.  I've been pleasantly surprised by how thankful people in the military have been to receive a copy of this film.  Despite the immense effort of Pentagon PR firms (like the Rendon Group) to trash this film, there are simply too many powerful insights for it to be ignored (hence, all the rageful reviews from those who have been ""Hannitized"" or otherwise intellectually handicapped).  These insights anger war profiteers and moral cowards, but many free-thinking Americans can handle the truth.  For instance, the truth shared by George Bush in the film when, at a fat-cat fundraising gala, he tells the audience, ""Some people consider you to be the elite, I consider you to be my base.""  A rare moment of honesty from the figure-head of corporate power, the chief gopher of Big Business.\n\nTo read the opinions that dozens of US military members and their families have of Moore and his work, check out ""Will They Ever Trust Us Again,"" a compilation of letters Moore has received from US troops.  I'm sure he could've also done a book of hate mail he has received, but those comments are so predictable and boring there wouldn't be much of a point to publishing the thoughts of self-righteous lemmings.\n\nMuch more interesting would be the thoughts of Iraqis on this film.  I'm sure they appreciate the efforts of US citizens to question an illegal invasion that has killed over 100,000 innocent people.\n\nMy only criticism of this DVD is that there is no option for Spanish subtitles.  Spanish speakers, including undocumented immigrants, are a growing part of our imperial forces.  They need access to the perspectives Moore provides in this important film.\n\nLastly, Moore is also featured in the award winning documentary, ""The Corporation,"" another DVD that helps to free our minds from establishment indoctrination.";A favorite among US troops

608;562.0;1.0;18.0;I will start off by saying that I am not a fan of Michael Moore's. That being said I felt that this film was pure sensationalism from a disingenuous film maker. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a one sided self serving film from a man who thrives on calling himself a political activist. Mr. Moore is often times misinformed and blinded by his dislike of President Bush. With Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael Moore has 2 uncensored hours to force feed us out of context statements and his own political commentary.\n\nAfter seeing this film the only questions on my mind were, how can I belive what I just saw from a man who openly critises the President of the United States any chance he has and what about the other side of the story? All of the reasearch for this film seems to have been done with one intention and that was to subject viewers to Mr. Moore's views and not on the facts of what happened.\n\nMichael Moore should be congratulated, not because the film opened my eyes to the world but because the film served one purpose his own. Mr. Moore made a bundle of money with this bit of propoganda. If you enjoy fantasy and sensationalism this is your movie!;Propaganda
616;563.0;5.0;18.0;Excellent Extras.  This very affecting film puts the complex story behind George Bush's War on Iraq into perspective.  It's better on DVD that it was in the theatres - there's so much information to take in you can at least pause and review.  Moore clearly has his point of view, but you can't deny the reality of what your seeing for real in Iraq and at home.;You Can't Deny the Facts...
625;564.0;4.0;18.0;"I have never written a review before, but felt moved after reading some of the more negative reviews of this film. Here is my criticisms of the film: Moore's use of footage of Iraq before the war of being an idealic place.  The segment on the ""Coiliton of the Willing"" depicting very stereotype images of the countries.\n\nHowever, I don't understand the reviews that totally discount Moore's film being a bunch of lies. When Moore uses clips of the president saying  dangerous statements such as ""Bring it on"", he is not lying. When he presents the mother of a soldier who has died he is not lying. I was happy to see Moore step away from these segments to let the mother tell her story.  Letting someone share there stories, feelings and experience, especially one that we rarely have the opportunity to hear is not exploitative. The woman at the end of the movie that tells the grieving mother not to believe the protesting woman, that ""this is all staged"" reminds me of the negative reviews. The greiving mother tells the skeptical woman that her son died in the war and she discounts it by saying, ""well a lot of people have died"". Some people in this country want to believe something so bad that they will say something is a lie even when it is it in their face. Everyone take the time to watch this film so that you can wake up. You don't even have to believe all the assertions that Moore comes up with but please give it a chance. For me this movie was a release.";Poignant and Moving.
626;565.0;1.0;18.0;"While I think Michael Moore is an absolute idiot, and his ""documentary"" nothing more than a collection of lies, half- truths and out of context quotations creatively assembled in the editing room, I must applaud and respect the fact that we, as Americans have the right to speak our opinion, however biased and mean spirited they may be. One can only hope that the truly enlightened will see this movie for the waste of film stock and electricity it truly is. Better yet, they will know what to expect from Mr. Moore and not have to put themselves through the ordeal of watching this trash.";Even morons have first amendment rights

677;568.0;4.0;18.0;"Farhenheit 9/11 is a glimpse into the last 4 years of the bush administration. It mocks President Bush for every bad move made along the way. Although alot of the anti-bush theories in the film are seemingly a little ""far fetched"" the film manages to be very funny and entertaining. It may be a one-sided documentary but its an interesting, sobering, laughable, and entertaining one at that.";The side of the story that wasn't told.
681;569.0;4.0;18.0;"As a polemic this is first rate stuff.  Moore has shaped a wonderful propaganda piece on Bush and the fallout of 9/11.  Of course, the movie doesn't bear up well under scrutiny, but that's not the point.  What Michael Moore has done is sound the alarm, and it is up to viewers to look closer at their commander in chief, and determine for themselves if he is ""The Right Man.""\n\nMoore hits all the nerves in this movies, from those dumfounded minutes when Bush sat fixed in the elementary classroom to very poignant moments with a mother of one of the fallen soldiers in Iraq.  Moore makes his case for the Saudi connection: the unsavory ties with the bin Laden family, the charming Prince Banda who seems to have Bush's inner ear, and the seeming cover up of the Royal Family's role in all this.  He also goes after the Congressmen, in particular the Democrats, who voted for the war resolution, against what appeared to be their own better judgement.\n\nThis movie will strike a chord with all those who have questioned the motivation of the Bush White House, and no doubt infuriate those who stand resolutely behind their Commander-in-Chief.  Moore is the modern day master of agit-prop.";Agit-prop at its best
690;570.0;4.0;18.0;Fahrinheit 9/11 did not just keep my attention the whole way threw. It did the unthinkable it showed information on the president that i thought myself would have completely exploited him at all costs. But i admire Micheal Moore for not just dilivering a greatly entertaining film but also showing us what we need to see and here. There are many people, who are against Micheal Moore and in some ways i have been and still am. But the irony is that people will make up there minds of this film before they even seeing it. I know because i did the same. But after seeing the film i know that Micheal Moore has made a movie that is not entirely untrue, though he takes some trueths and twists them in key areas so that they stay true in fact, but the people and media get the wrong idea. But the accually  gist of it is that about 90% of this film is accually facts and untwisted facts. The movie dos have some problems though sometimes the music will overshadow the over all sounds and fell of the events takeing place at the time in the movie and though you really want to pay attention to the film. You cant because this problem becomes too anoiying. Though i only found this to be a problem for about the first 20 minutes of the film.\n\nThe movie is also verry violent in some seens and shows some verry raw and gritty images of the fight in ireaq, after seeing these seens of creul and violent nature (which also adds in some at times unnessessary language) there really is no reason to heed the film R rating like some of the media is trying to do. The conent alone should grant this and R rating. In the end Micheal Moore has made an acceptionally good movie, that will be the hype of conversations, leading up to the upcoming ellection.;Micheal Moores  VS.  George W. Bush
723;571.0;1.0;18.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 was a major disappointment to me. I have been a fan of Michael Moore's for several years and have found his other films to be excellent (Roger & Me, Bowling for Culumbine). I found this film to go way beyond the boundries of a documentary. Being in the motion picture industry myself, it was fairly easy for me to see the subtle manipulations he used to get the audience to feel the way he wanted. I think it's very sad when someone uses their talent & influence for their own personal desires without any regard for the truth. I wish people would keep art & politics separate from each other. You lost a fan on this one Michael.;Brain Washing
729;572.0;5.0;18.0;"Whether you're a liberal or a conservative (or anywhere else on the political spectrum), this documentary is a must-see. I took a conservative friend of mine to see this film in theaters over the summer. Like so many others, he was an avid supporter of Bush because he had never been told why he shouldn't be. I asked him on the way into the theater who he was going to vote for. He replied ""Bush, of course!"" Knowing that we were walking into a movie which was sure to introduce many new issues to him, I said nothing. When it was over, as we were walking out, I asked him the same question once again. He replied, ""Definitely not that *ss-hole!"" Not knowing it was going to have such an impact on him, I said, ""Who do you mean?"" ""George Bush,"" he said, ""I am absolutely not going to vote for George Bush."" This film had a wonderful impact on my friend and I am certain that it will on just about anyone else who watches it. I give this documentary five stars and a big smile!";A Must-See
730;573.0;4.0;18.0;By way of introduction, I consider myself a true moderate.  That means that I watch BOTH CNN and Fox News, and I listen to BOTH local AM radio and NPR.  Apparently, I am in the minority, as most Americans seem to want to listen to only the people who support their existing viewpoint.\n\nAt the time this film came out, I looked desparately for a detractor who had ACTUALLY seen it.  Much to my chagrin, even John McCain, my favorite national politician (at least until he started serving as water-boy for the Bush re-election campaign), dissed the film without having even seen it.\n\nAs a piece of film (for which it is rarely judged), this is a very well put together - with a nice contrast between the comic and the tragic.\n\nAs a political commentary and indictment of the Bush administration, there is a whole lot of stuff that I took with the requisite grain of salt.  First of all, the fact that only one officer patrols the entire coast of Oregon is not only not within the jurisdiction of the federal government, but is not really that significant.  Secondly, I do not really think that the Bush-Bin Laden family connection, and financial gain to be had from a war on terrorism, inhibited the administration from stopping 9/11, as is implied by parts of the film.  The problem I have with conspiracy theories is that they assume a level of competency that is probably not there.\n\nUltimately, however, I believe that there are parts of this film that are effectively indisputable and ultimately cemented my opposition to the Bush administration.  The most telling part of the film is the footage of Bush, continuing in his photo op with grade school children, for several minutes after being told the U.S. was under attach.  Just watch the blank stare of a deer in the headlights, without Moore's commentary, and tell me that this is the guy you want to be the next president.  It says alot about the true nature of his character and the tremendous influence of his handlers that he did not get up, right then and there, and do SOMETHING.  We already knew from the 2000 election that this guy was no Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, or Reagan, but that footage (conspicuously absent at the time 9/11 occured) has convinced me that this has got to stop.  And I still haven't heard a rebuttal from the Republicans on THIS part of the film.;Well done . . . if you are open-minded.
137;574.0;5.0;17.0;"Many people view certain elements of their country, such as culture and people, as an entirely separate entity from the government and power structures that rule it (in this context, phrases like ""love it or leave it"" have little relevancy). It is this sentiment that led Thomas Paine to say, ""It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government."" Noam Chomsky, a critic of American foreign policy, writes:\n\nThe concept ""anti-American"" is an interesting one. The counterpart is used only in totalitarian states or military dictatorships... Thus, in the old Soviet Union, dissidents were condemned as ""anti-Soviet."" That's a natural usage among people with deeply rooted totalitarian instincts, which identify state policy with the society, the people, the culture.\n\nIn contrast, people with even the slightest concept of democracy treat such notions with ridicule and contempt. Suppose someone in Italy who criticizes Italian state policy were condemned as ""anti-Italian."" It would be regarded as too ridiculous even to merit laughter. Maybe under Mussolini, but surely not otherwise.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the critics of this movie who call Moore Anti-American can't see beyond their Republican noses. Yes, you can be a critic of the American government and a patriot at the same time. Wow! What a concept! If any Repulicans and their chicken hawk friends knew history, they'd know that Jefferson advocated a revolution every 20 years just to keep the government from getting out of control. Moore is a true patriot in the old sense of the word.\n\nThe ""new"" patriots like Hannity and Limbaugh are totalitarians wrapped in the stars and stripes, depending on followers too dumb to see what they're really up to. Most Americans can't even recall when we were Saddam's best friends - that's when he was gassing the Kurds. Why didn't we get rid of him then?\n\nThe fact that the US Government encourages trade with China, a Communist country, is and always will be a slap in the face to the veterans of the Vietnam war, who were told they were over there fighting for FREEDOM from Communism. We also do trade with Vietnam, as if they are no longer Communist. Does something stink here? Trouble is, we have had a government that for a long, long time, we can't trust around the corner, and an uneducated citizenry with a very short memory. No wonder the rest of the world thinks we're stupid. I do listen to right wing radio, and never heard anyone knocking trade with China - instead they knock legitimate protests against it, like the WTO protest. Whose side are the chickenhawks on anyway?\n\nWhenever rich fat-a**ed chicken hawks are telling you to send your poor or working class kid over to fight for oil for Haliburton under some false pretext, it's time for a change.\n\nI disliked Bowling for Columbine, but I have to hand it to Moore for this one. Good job.";ANTI-AMERICAN?  I THINK NOT
803;575.0;4.0;18.0;"A foreword; Bush is a wimp, liar, cheat, thief, war-dodging scumbag who should be indicted and impeached on multiple fronts for his crimes while in the Oval Office.\n\nThat's what I thought BEFORE I watched this movie.  When it came out, I was glad to see so many people turning out to watch it.  It wasn't that long ago a poll showed 79% of Americans approved of Bush's overall performance as President.  It frustrated me to see so many of my fellow citizens, intelligent and otherwise, being taken by this Administration's fear-mongering tactics as an excuse to invade Iraq.\n\nMichael Moore presents a blistering documentary of the Bush Family's crooked past and present. If only 10% of the allegations are true, George W. Bush deserves to be impeached.  Moore is a courageous man for putting out such a film, in spite of death and censorship threats from the wonderful, caring Republicans; not the kind of people I want running this country.\n\nRemember to vote!";HAIL TO THE CHICKEN-IN-CHIEF!
859;576.0;5.0;18.0;Partisan Republican's say this movie is full of lies. They are lying. That's all they do. They are great at it!

887;577.0;5.0;18.0;"I've seen this movie twice now, and in the interest of full disclosure, have been a Moore fan since ""Roger & Me"". I've seen/read everything he's done-""Roger..."", ""The Big One"", ""Canadian Bacon"", ""Bowling for Columbine"", his TV shows, ""TV Nation"", and ""The Awful Truth"", and his books, ""Downsize This!"", ""Adventures in a TV Nation"", ""Stupid White Men"", and ""Dude, Where's My Country?""-but don't take that to mean I'm a non-critical viewer.\n\nMoore has been known to exaggerate, and some of his stunts come off as more juvenlie than effective, it's true. I'd be the first to admit that.\n\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" even contains some of that kind of grandstanding, but not a lot. This movie finds Moore comparatively restrained. He lets his facts and documents speak for themselves, for the most part. Theatrics and confrontational stunts take a back seat here. (Although, the scene of Moore reading the actual text of the USA Patriot Act through the loudspeaker of an ice cream truck on the driveway of Capitol Hill after being told that many members of Congress had simply not read it by a member of the House is particularly choice, and an example of Moore's trademark style being a very effective satirical tool to illustrate his point.)\n\nBut that's the thing about this movie. If even a half...a QUARTER...of the allegations made are true, we already have what John Dean called ""Worse Than Watergate"" in his book of that title. And Moore is more than willing to show his sources and back up his factual assertions, leading one to believe that the ratio is far higher than that.\n\nLook at the poor reviews on these boards. The vast majority of them are simple pot-shots. Pure ad hominem, with no real critique of the actual content of the film. The few that do address the contents, and cast them as distortion and flat-out lies, do absolutely nothing to back up their assertions.\n\nWhat's clear is that Michael Moore loves this country enough to be outraged, and put his money (and celluloid) where his mouth is when those in power betray it, as he sees it. Last I checked, this is simply participating in the public dialogue at a level he's earnbed with his previous efforts.  The current President is not the institution of the Presidency, George W. Bush is not ""America"" and to take issue with the former is not the same as taking issue with the latter.\n\nAs a sidenote, some may take issue with the whopping 10-15 seconds of film which might, to some, give the impression of Iraq under Saddam as being somehow idyllic, but he never says that, or even implies it strongly. Rather, I saw that sequence as a somewhat ham-handed visual depiction of ""calm before the storm"", and only the tiniest part of a much larger (and more relevant) whole.\n\nDon't miss the forest for the trees in evaluating this movie and making up your OWN mind. See this movie and do that.";Too much evidence to ignore
893;578.0;4.0;18.0;Well despite the somewhat biased and wholly expected spin I liked this movie. This is a good flick if only because it portrays to the world exactly how easy it is for a weasel to control a barnyard of mindless, milling cattle. It is nice to see someone has the guts to show these preening and obviously insincere clowns as privileged children playing politician. GWB really does need a good spanking!\n\nand... the parrot like rhetoric coming from the mouths of some of the American occupying forces showed them to be just as idiotic as the mommys and daddys who whine to God about taking their son(s) away from them. A second generation of moron!\n\nI also liked the way the movie very frankly focussed on the hypocrisy of sending (or recruiting) the lowest rung on the economic ladder to do the dirty/grunt work for the corporate elite. If MM were to have connected the dots (keeping the quality of American educational institutions low to ensure a fresh crop of eager dummies for the governments next illegal and unethical incursion) I'd probably give this one a five.;"to a liar the truth is ""propaganda"""

There's no way I could start on specifics here, but the following link is a good summary of the many deciets in Fahrenheit 9/11.

The way Moore depicts Iraq as nothing but peaceful to the world and it's citizens truly does sicken me.\n\nThe way he also says the election would've been won if recounted again no matter what for Gore in the beginning of the movie was completely false... along with how he accuses of Bush going to war just to please his former business associates.\n\n55% of the American people trust Bush and approve of what he's done, and I'm one of them.

Together with others who on that day walked for miles, getting comfort from others along the way, I seethed as I watched President Bush in this documentary, listening to a story in a school for a photo opportunity at the very moment I watched people die on Trinity Street.\n\nMichael Moore, currently reporting on the RNC, I thank you for making this documentary.  Thank you also for being witness to the exploitation and prostitution of that horrific day currently taking place by this administration at this event.

Then again, why behead a man whose head is useless, anyway.";Ugh
1084;586.0;3.0;18.0;If you begin this film with the undisputed knowledge that Michael Moore has an agenda, and that agenda is hating Bush and getting him out, then you should be prepped to watch this with the appropriate amount of judgement necessary to weigh the facts/opinions he lays out.\n\nA film with an unapoloagetic agenda, I do have to appreciate.  Moore carefully lays out what appears to be very shady goings on in the post 9/11 America, and the Bush administration in general.  I will say that I found some of his arguments and fact gathering very intriquing.  Ya gotta give the man credit for dogged research.\n\nThat being said, he is very selective about which facts he reveals, and how he lights them.  For instance...one segment has him talking to Secret Service agents guarding the Saudi embassy.  It would appear that the Saudi's are given special treatment by the secret service.  However...Moore fails to mention that ALL foreign embassies have assigned Secret Service agents.  There are several instances of selective fact statement, so I think it's important to remember that some of his more astounding 'black/white' angles do have decided shades of gray.\n\nWhat I appreciate about this film, and why I do recommend it, is because it sparked me to do my own fact finding and come to my own conclusion about the arguments displayed in the film.  It made me think, and actually motivated me to find out more about my government, and to help educate myself on my choice for president.  It's a welcome change when a film spurs action, and for that reason, I can recommend this...as long as one doesn't make the mistake of making Michael Moore's Bush administration one's own.;Well done documentary, but remember to bring your salt.
1116;587.0;1.0;18.0;Many of the things stated in this movie have been proven to be outright lies. Moore talks about bringing out the truth and then he includes a bunch of flat out lies, to make the point he obviously can't make with the truth. He obviously is on a mission to destroy Bush and doesn't care much whether his effort is based on fact or fiction. This guy might be getting a moment of fame from democrats, but his insignificant below average talent will vanish back into obscurity soon enough. He needs a long bath and a shave, inside as well as out.;Double Talk
1161;588.0;1.0;18.0;"First, let me start this by stating that I don't agree with Bush's policies and I don't agree with the way he's handled the war in Iraq.\n\n So why don't I like this film? Although I agree with many of the things Moore says, I think Bush has done enough wrong that there is no need to state facts in a misleading fashion to criticize him.\n\n The film begins with slow motion footage of leading Republicans being prepared for interviews (make up application, hair styling, etc). What message is this supposed to send? Are we supposed to actually believe that Democrats don't wear makeup for TV, but Republican do? A similar montage could just as easily been put together of top Democrats. I feel these images were a cheap attempt to embarrass and humiliate people.\n\n Second, Moore discusses how much Saudi Arabia has invested in the US and how much leading Republicans have invested in the defense industry. I don't believe for one second that Saudia Arabia is investing significantly more in the US than the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, or any number of other countries are investing. I also don't believe that leading Democrats aren't investing in the defense industry. If there has been special treatment by the Bush administration for Saudis (which I think there probably has been), I don't think it is ANY different than Clinton, Bush Sr, or Reagan.\n\n I didn't find any ""new"" information in the section on Iraq, but maybe this is because I live in Germany and the German media (not to mention all of Europe) is highly critical of the war. Perhaps there are things that are reported here that are not reported by the US media, I can't comment on that.\n\n Next is the Coalition of the Willing; countries like Morocco, Iceland, etc, were listed, but Japan, South Korea, Poland, Spain, Italy, and the UK were not. They are (or were) not contributing as much to the war as the US, but they were the 6 biggest countries in the coalition when the war began, and they were not mentioned. Maybe it would have been more effective to discuss how almost all of these countries had a majority of the population against their involvement in the war. Wouldn't this have as much impact?\n\n While the death of US soldiers in Iraq is terrible and is tragic because they should never have been sent, I think it was pretty disgusting to spend 15 minutes following the mother of a fallen soldier around and spend less than 5 minutes on a montage of fallen Iraqis. Of course she is in pain and so are all Americans, but this is American self-centeredness on a grand scale and it is probably one of the biggest things Europeans criticize Americans for. The message it sent me was that American deaths mean more than Iraqi deaths. There are plenty of insurgents that are fighting, but for every dead US soldier, dozens of COMPLETELY innocent Iraqis have been killed. In addition to the American mother, why not follow an Iraqi mother around? The German and British media have many specials doing just that, documenting surviving family members trying (and failing) to receive compensation from the Coalition, compensation which is ""technically"" available.\n\n I also agree that America is living in a state of fear, but I don't think this is a conspiracy by the Bush administration. The media knows that fear gets ratings. The network news must compete with the cable news channels and the cable channels need 24 hours of programming. I think this state of fear is the media and not Bush. The same arguments were made in Bowling for Columbine, and this was for the most part describing the state of the media during Clinton's presidency.\n\n Overall, I thought that a film could be made with the same message and just as much impact without including the embarassing images and using statistics out of context. Bush has really damaged world opinion of the US and burned a lot of bridges in Europe. Maybe this film is only intended for an American audience, but for foreigners, I think it painted no better picture of Americans than Bush does. After all the media hype, I really expected more from Moore.";This film irritated me to no end...

Even if all American's did watch this movie, it takes an open minded individual to truly grasp what Moore is saying.

I do not share Mr. Moore's socialist politics, indeed I view him as anti-American.  However, in view of the ballyhooed press I expected a more compelling movie.  As a propagandist, Moore is at his best showing dead babies, maimed soldiers and grieving families, but sorrow needs no cinematic skill.  Moore dwells upon these negatives of war torn Iraq with a blind eye; indeed Moore's vision seems akin to that of a one-eyed cleric. His occasional touch of humor also lacks art, having the routineness and impact of an average late night tv joke.  As a documentary, the film fails completely.  The dozens of significant factual deceptions documented in depth by Kopel on the internet destroys the film's credibility.  Without credibility, the movie becomes high schoolish; a movie clipping montage strung together to provide images and words for Moore's peculiar story, which is decidedly different from the many stories from which the images were extracted.  You may choose to beleive Moore's conspiratorial tale or not, but I doubt that Moore will have much to do with that belief.

In the interests of full disclosure, here's mine up front:  Bush is a failure as a president as well as a businessman; even if I approved of his domestic policy (which I don't), his hideous legacy in the Middle East, the consequences of which we will be dealing with for decades, would still tip the scales against him.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed Michael Moore's expose, even though it is largely preaching to the choir in my case.  Beyond the extent of the links between the Bush clan and prominent Saudi business interests, there was little in this film that was new to me.  Although I basically agree with the points Moore makes, I recognize that he is often unfair in the way he juxtaposes images and uses his commentary to create context.  An example: Moore would have us believe that Bush might very well have been pondering the above-mentioned Saudi links while he sat stunned before Florida schoolchildren following the attacks on the Trade Center, although it seems doubtful to me that he had received enough information to make such connections.\n\nWhile ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" may not be as ""fair and balanced"" as the Fox News Channel (LOL), bear in mind that a documentary has no obligation to be.  Moore's film should be seen as a powerful polemic rather than dispassionate journalism; he cares deeply about his topic, and he is up front about where he stands on the issue.  Much of the criticism of him comes from anger and jealousy that he has touched upon a deep chord of anger toward Bush in this country by those on the right who are not above spinning facts themselves.";The 411 on 911

Having said that, I support the idea of getting a look at other opinions and views.  One show I used to always watch was Bill Maher's old show, ""Politically Incorrect"" because it usually contained opinions from both sides and each side was given a voice.  And it was amusing.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" however is not such a case.  Its a film full of a bunch of little conspiracy theories that are presented as facts.  I wouldn't even go so far as to call them that because you can do the research on your own to find that a lot of the film's scenes are edited and distorted to present an illusion.  An illusion that is sadly being misunderstood by many Americans who are accepting this film as fact.  After picking it apart, to call it a documentary would be a joke.  Now effective propaganda?  You bet!  If you are the kind that doesn't really follow politics you would almost without a doubt walk away from this film, hating the Bush Administration.  But if you did your homework and found out all the liberties that he took with all the various parts you would find out what a fake of a movie this really is and how insulting it is to the intelligence of the American people.  Now I know your probably wondering what I am talking about but the truth is I could write pages and pages on the lies in this movie.  My advice is to watch the movie.

With Moore's film, we as the American public get to see a side of these travesties not covered by the media. (...) There was too much footage of September 11th and the present War in Iraq of the dying soldiers, wounded soldiers, Iraqi women and children, and families from both Iraq and America. If you laughed, that's disgusting because no matter how you feel about Bush, you have to give those people some respect. A good friend of mine is presently serving in Iraq. She's 27 and has 2 children. She also 3 siblings also in the military and 2 of which are also in Iraq. This is a REAL war for some of us and I encourage everyone to please keep an open mind when watching this film. I did subtract a star in my rating simply because I did feel that Michael Moore did unnecessarily bash Bush in a couple of moments by taking what he said out of context. I'm not even a Bush supporter and I will admit to that. I also think to some more easily influenced, it will give a false impression that Bush is somehow in favor of this war for profit or just trying to cover his own butt. I don't buy that at all.

903;623.0;4.0;17.0;"Moore turns up the volume in this relentless assault on President Bush, but when we get past his overt bias, and the fact that a film of this cadre has been allowed to play in the first place during a reign that he denounces with such vitriol, we recognize that F-9/11 does have a lot to offer.\n\nHis antics (such as reading the Patriot Act over a loudspeaker from an ice cream truck outside the White House) are as funny as ever, and some of his questions (why exactly WAS a Taliban official in Dallas in 2001 anyway) really do merit consideration.\n\nEven the most staunch critics of this film's message and ideology will have to admit that Moore did his homework this time around. Unlike BFC, even if the chronology of the footage in this context was altered, it would still be equally incriminating. The film is a blistering indictment chock full of factual information (service records, taped interviews, real video footage) that cannot be categorically labeled as false.\n\nMy gripes have more to do with some narrative decisions:\n\n(1) We spend a lot of time showing Bush and Company combing their hair and primping for TV. Doesn't everyone undergo similar preparation before going on air? The sequence is of no real value to the film and inflates the running time by several wasted minutes, especially when a single frame of preening is repeated over and over again.\n\n(2) Seems a little unfair to rope in a teen popstar to support the idea. She's a kid and for what it is worth, I believe she handled an unexpected question that was clearly out of her league rather graciously.\n\n(3) The episode asking senators to sign their kids up for war was a bit messy. If you were a senator and had a documentary film producer walk up to you with an application form and a TV crew, would you say, ""Gee since this may be in public view, and since you are such an important and appropriately authorized person for this job, here, let me sign up my daughter to be shipped to Iraq""? Can't see what the idea behind this was, especially because the senator says that he HIMSELF was in the navy.\n\n(4) The scenes at the end with a bereaved woman are a bit drawn out (even if moving at first) and seemed to blame the Republicans for sending her son to war. This to me comes across as self-contradictory as the woman herself had said earlier that army was a good workaround lifestyle for people in her impoverished town. When one signs up for war, isn't he expected to know what it entails? Sounds a bit convenient to want the best of both worlds.\n\nAnyway, these are minor gripes in comparison to the bigger picture that the film addresses.\n\nYou may agree or disagree with its assertions, question/deride the validity of its arguments, or use it as a point of reference, but at the very least Fahrenheit 9/11 hits all the right nerves. Some of the footage from US blanket bombing (oops, precision bombing) of Iraq is gutwrenching.\n\nA movie I highly recommend regardless of your political or ideological stance, if only for the perspective of the innocent being maimed in a land that posed or poses no threat to the US, even if they have WMDs hidden somewhere deep in the bowels of their natural oil fields.";HERE'S A REVIEW OF THE FILM, FOR A CHANGE
923;624.0;5.0;17.0;Economics runs politics and heres the proof. Some politicians are using their position to make a lot of money. We have to face this painful fact. The only positive solution is to read and vote without letting the apathy, that self serving politicans engender in us, run us down. Depression and apathy won't change the society and it just feeds the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nToday greed and consumerism seem to run our lives and i feel we need to find morals, find personal strength and take part in political discussion more than ever. It seems its become bad to talk about politics. Its seen as heavy or depressing or serious. But we need serious rather than seeking fun all the time.\n\nBush is just one man, dictators have always been here and they always will be. But now the techniques to control people are very advanced and based around manufactured fears and substitution games (eg you need to buy this to take away your loneliness or make your life so much better).\n\nHopefully films like this will help us all speak up with more knowledge and confidence. Lets try to stop hiding from our fears. Modern politicians use fear and your home and goods to keep you quiet and powering the system till you die.\n\nApathy, manufactured fear and ignorance = the governments we've got.\n\nCome on or we're dooommed..;The current political world
135;625.0;1.0;16.0;"This film was nothing more than a stupid attempt to influence the last election and a sad shameless cash in on the 9-11 tragedy and the war in Iraq. And yes I have seen the film because I had to watch it last year as part of a class. The attempts at humor are not funny and in bad taste as well. I didn't laugh at any one of those stupid attempts at a joke. The most disgusting thing though was when Micheal Moore used the images of a mother crying over her son who was killed in Iraq to make a political statement. He also edited footage that contradicted him. Go watch ""Farrenhype 9/11"" if you don't believe me. And the mother who was exploited in this film even criticized Moore for his potrayal of her son and her. Mr. Moore represents everything that is wrong with the American left these days. Hopefully though, he'll continue his stupid attempts because he only succeeds in making every left-minded person look bad. Guess who he's going to exploit next in his new movie ""Sicko""? The mentally handicapped! Wait to go Mike! Your gonna profit off of someone else's suffering as well. Michael Moore is a propagandist, not a documentary film maker. He's the kind of person who could make Hitler look like a saint. Avoid this crockumentary at all costs along with all of his previous films.";Exploitation of tragedy and about as factually accurate as a Nazi propaganda tape

But, no...the entire culture of America's intelligence community falls upon the shoulders of a man who was president for less than 8 months!\n\nLiberals take note:  wanting something to be the truth doesn't make it facts!

1077;627.0;5.0;17.0;Some of this is Michael Moores slant on things. Those parts are pretty obvious.\n\nSome things you cannot fake.

1105;628.0;1.0;17.0;"For this to be deemed a ""documentary"" is an absolute joke.  It is a blending of fact, fiction, half-truths, and one-man's opinion.  If Moore were any more desperate for the attention he is so clearly seeking, he'd strap a webcam on the bill of his cap and webcast himself ranting 24-7.  Just because someone says it doesn't mean it's so, and this movie is no exception.  If Moore told you that the gravel in his front yard was actually moon rocks, would you believe him?  Based on box office figures, I hate to say that it looks like plenty of you would.  Wake up, sheep.  The mainstream media may not be telling the whole truth, the White House may not be telling the whole truth, but this blowhard sure isn't doing it either.";Call It Like It Is
1182;629.0;5.0;17.0;Overall, Michael Moore presents a tremendous amount of information and opinion regarding the current political situation and the facts regarding our war with Iraq. For this reason alone everyone should see the movie, but in addition people watching it should think critically about what they are seeing.\n\nTo the earlier reviewer who gives the link to the website Fifty-Nine Deceits in F9/11, by Dave Kopel. I went to this website and find the arguments presented extremely weak. First of all, the author quotes a statement Moore said that seems to suggest Moore is not that interested in 9/11. It is very possible to be intensely interested in 9/11 and make the statement Moore made. Moore's statement is accurate, taking into account that the probability of another terrorist attack of the same level as the previous one in the US is slim due to new measures the US has taken.\n\nThe rest of this website contests minor points about the movie that do not affect the outcome or the veracity of Fahrenheit 9/11. Dave Kopel also makes use of the fine print in order to trick the reader. For example, regarding the Gore recount, I personally heard Pat Buchanan admit on television that all of the votes he received in the particular Florida county could not have been meant for him considering that they were so out of line with the percentages in other counties and secondly were inconsistent with the demographic base of that county. Going to what is legal as Kopel does has no relevance and makes the law supreme instead of what is right. There have been many laws that have been unjust, for example regarding slavery. The website is a weak attempt to discredit the documentary without proper justification.\n\nSo, watch the movie and keep an open mind.;Excellent documentary
1189;630.0;1.0;17.0;"I highly resent this film being even placed in the category documentary. This implies that the facts are all researched thouroughly, and it's a thoughtful compiling of those facts in history. Thoughtful? Facts? It's Holly wood folks.\n\n AS to the recent person who said MM has come up with a site to prove his facts consider this; the entire film was spewing one message; venom for the current administration in an election year. Duh. Any one who just believes these facts probably also believes that spider man really crawled up that wall. People, hollywood can make you believe anything. I saw numerous errors in the film, and as we know now the 9-11 commission has proven that no one left for Iraq after the bombings.  But I'm sure MM would say that was made up also.  As I said, you can make up anything in hollywood.\n\nAnd Michael Moore a man of the people? Would that be when he goes home to his multimillion dollar condo in Manhattan, or when he relaxes at his multimillion dollar resort home in Michigan?  I will say this.

1250;634.0;5.0;17.0;Fahrenheit made me hot!! Sizziling with rage and devestated with sadness, and guilt. Whatever responsibility this movie puts on Bush's shoulders, I, Too, feel the weight on mine. Each time I fill up my gastank. This film clearly states that America is at war in order to fuel our consumerism, cash flow, and corporations. These corporations we support by consuming their product. It also shows how the rich get richer. How Bush is at home with the have's and have more's. Greed is a weapon of mass destruction. THis film is fabulous in that it will educate a lot of people who need to be educated through their t.v's in order to understand it. Moore is my hero. He is bringing the heart of America, the real people who live here, work here, and he is squeezing until the pulse stops, we die and are reborn as our own army of ignorance realized. Loved it!;GREED  IS a Weapon of MASS Destruction!
1304;635.0;1.0;17.0;Im suprised people still call this crap a documentary,Its just filled with lies, Osamas brother was on the today show talking about what BS it acctually was, face it people the Bush administration didn't give the Bin Ladens special treatment, also I cant believe some people even like Michael Moore, when he was promoting his movie in France he basically said all Americans are stupid, just to get a quick buck, we should hang this traitor but since he weighs 400 pounds it probubly wouldent work.;Lame
1316;636.0;4.0;17.0;"People need to understand that criticizing the president of the United States is not the same as criticizing America.  America is a big country and everyone helps to make it what it is.  When some people don't like the way other people are taking it, no matter who those people are are how much power they have, they often speak out about it, and it is their right and responsibility to do so.  I'm surprised at the degree of flippancy with which the word ""Unamerican"" is being bandied about these days.  You'd think Americans would be much warier of that word, particularly for the associations it has carried since the 1950s when Joseph McCarthy wielded it like an errant locomotive and destroyed the careers of countless government officials and other Americans through the simple power of vague suggestion.  I'd really hate to see that happen again, but it seems that many right-wing Americans are not afraid to utilize such techniques to silence the left, then as now.  It's a dangerous game and we have to keep it in historical perspective.\nThat having been said, I think Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very important film, and a very important historical event.  In his propoganda (yes, I believe it is propaganda, but no one is criticizing George W. Bush's television ads, which potentially play to a much larger audience.  I suppose that would be be dangerously Unamerican...) Moore gives all Americans who oppose the war a very clear and decisive voice against our current administration.  While I don't always admire Moore's techniques, I don't think that the minor flaws that critics tend to gravitate toward invalidate the film or diminish its prevailing message.  Perhaps the war was good in certain ways.  It unseated a vicious dictator, and perhaps will mean a better way of life for the Iraqis that survive.  But I think Moore's film should raise questions in anyone's mind concerning the war's real motivation.  Doesn't it seem suspicious to anyone that focus shifted so quickly from Osama bin Laden (you just don't hear much about him anymore, do you?) to Saddam Hussein?  It felt to me like he just kind of came out of nowhere, and I didn't need Moore to suggest that to me.  And why Iraq?  Aren't there other oppressive governments in the world like, for example, Sudan or, (gasp) Saudi Arabia? To answer that question, Moore exposes the Bush familly's extremely suspicious corporate connections with Saudis and oil businesses like Dick Cheney's Haliburton, which has received almost $1 billion in no-bid contracts to harvest Iraqi oil .  No one who criticizes the film seems to want to touch that issue, and I think it is at the heart of the film.  It is a truly important question: if you received $400,000 a year from one group of people and $1.4 billion a year from another, whose best interest would you be quicker to serve?\nCertain parts of Moore's film bothered me.  I think he panders to his audiences emotionally and uses low blows to make his subjects look more ridiculous than they are, but no one can deny that he is a gifted film maker and feels strongly about the message he delivers.  I'm very proud that a  pro-American like Michael Moore is giving such a powerful voice to values in which I have believed for years.  There are very ugly issues on our table and we need to clear them off before sitting down to take pride in our nation.  Before you criticize what I have written, make sure you are actually criticizing, and not simply falling back on the fact that my arguments are common or ""old.""  If you have a valid argument, use it.  But if not don't just jerk your knees and raise your voice without saying anything.  Understand that my voice is one of many (common) voices calling for change in November, and I'm glad to have Michael Moore as a spokesman.";Anti-Bush is not Anti-American!
1326;637.0;4.0;17.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 is far from a classic piece of film rhetoric or propaganda, but for an indie film produced with limited finances, marginal film stock, and limited access to government records, etc, it's not bad.  Like Eisenstein's Odessa Steps or D. W. Griffith's Piedmont, S.C., Moore uses place (Flint and Washington) as a microcosm for abstract ideas about the inequality and incalculable costs of a nation's war-making ways.  And like both of those acclaimed directors, he uses montage effectively.  In fact, the shot of children playing in a near-bucolic Baghdag prior to the American bombing is reminiscent of Coppola's shot of a pastoral Vietnam village just before Robert Duval blows it to smithereens in Apocalypse Now.\n\nLess effective are Moore's own appearances in the film.  Far from the subtlety of a Hitchcock, they bear the sophomoric heavy-handedness of a Saturday Night Live skit.  Moreover, doesn't Moore understand that this much attention brought to the messenger can only serve to detract from the strength and lasting impression of the message?\n\nAlso, I'm surprised that the film spends so little time implicating Cheney and the President's men.  By concentrating so intently and frequently on an obtuse and arrogant-looking Bush, the film makes him a more memorable, colorful character than he deserves to be.  As far as the war's supporters are concerned, this film could actually strengthen true believers' attachment to the present leader as a misunderstood, misrepresented banner carrier.\n\nThe best-written, most effective parts of the film are the beginning and end, where Moore is able to make the point that neither in Florida nor in Baghdad could the conservative base and keepers of the corporate store tolerate a loss, much less a conclusive victory.  Quoting Orwell, Moore leaves us with a chilling reminder of why war in itself serves the interests of the privileged and the powerful.;He's No Eisenstein, Riefenstahl, Griffith or Coppola

1465;639.0;5.0;17.0;Riveting is an understatement for this movie. There are some who stay on top of the news and know most of what is presented in this movie and those of us are infuriated at the current administration. Now maybe more people will have knowledge and become less complacent about what is happening to us as a country.\nWhat I think is so wonderful about Michael Moore putting this information in movie form is, for those who do not read, who trust what is spoon fed to them on a daily basis from the media and a media which is pretty much under control of the Bush White House, will have their eyes open.\nMy only complaint, and this is a very small one, is that Michael Moore sometimes finds it necessary to edit things to emphasize his position, when it isn't necessary at all. The truth can stand on it's own. Example being the Senator who was asked if he would send his child to Iraq and had a surprised look, then it cut away to the next scene. I saw him interviewed and he is upset because he does have family members in Iraq (I believe nephews). It would be more advantageous to show things as they are, because, let's face it, it's pretty darn bad, all on it's own.\nGreat movie that will have a big impact.;Valuable Film with Invaluable Information.
1473;640.0;5.0;17.0;"Whew!  Ya know, I'm not sure, but I think this film may actually be anti-Bush.  I'd have to go see it again and take notes to really be sure - it's a bit subtle!\nOK, so ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not exactly the most even-handed treatment of its subject(s).  I doubt whether anybody could argue that fact.  Actually, it's quite a pretty piece of vituperation directed squarely and ruthlessly at ""Dubbya"" and his administration for practically everything they have done since entering the White House.  It runs the gamut of anti-Bush sentiment, from the shady way he ""won"" the election, to the large percentage of time he spent on vacation before (and even after) 9/11, to the quite specific ties the Bush family has to the Bin Laden family (oh yes), to his hamfisted handling of the largest foreign attack ever on US soil, to his cursory military strike on Afghanistan to appease angry US citizens before hurling us into a ""premeditated, unprovoked"" war on Iraq, which is explained in ""9/11"" as basically a ""Blood for Oil"" expedition...and so on.  Michael Moore interviews bereaved moms and disillusioned soldiers, he corners senators on the street and asks them to enlist their children, he rides an ice cream truck around the capitol to read the Patriot Act to our elected officials (since apparently none of them bothered to read it before signing it into law), he takes every tack he can think of to cast the Bush Administration in the most unfavorable light possible.\nAnd in fact, he does succeed.  This movie will get a lot of people riled up.  I don't remember the last time I saw a film in the theatre and the audience erupted into applause every 5 minutes - but that's what happened here.  People WANT to see these points made.  They want an honest accounting of the events of the last 3 years, and they simply are not getting straight (or believable) answers from Washington.  Do they get it from Moore?  Well, at least they get a take-no-prisoners accounting from the other side.  In my opinion, one ought to take ALL opinions with a grain of salt - including mine! - but it's pretty obvious that a) Bush and his lackeys are not straight shooters, and b) Michael Moore is out to get them.  These things should be considered before buying into either side's story.\nI'd like to make this point though with reference to ""smear campaigns,"" since it's quite legitimate to describe this film as such.  Six years ago we actually impeached a president because he lied about an extramarital sex act.  Well, ""we"" didn't - rather the GOP made it their political raison d'etre to bash the Democrat, and they succeeded in appealing to the lowest common denominator of self-righteous sexual indignation to get their constituents behind it.  Now, yes, a lie is a lie, but on the other hand, all lies are NOT the same.  I daresay - let me make this controversial point - that whether or not Clinton got some action in the Oval Office is not quite as relevant to our daily lives as whether or not Bush lied about the election, the elusive WMDs, or the ultimate reason for the war itself, which has killed thousands of our young soldiers.  How is it that we can impeach one president over a stained dress, while the next one gets away with so many really heinous atrocities against the trust and security of the American people?  What kind of country IS this?  At the very least, we CANNOT re-elect Bush, if we all still want to be here for the next election.  God willing, this film will help and not hinder John Kerry, who is at least conclusively the ""lesser of two evils"" this time around.\nSee this film!  Take its message with a grain of salt, but keep it in the back of your mind when you watch Bush founder as he tries to justify why your son or daughter isn't coming home.";A much-needed message from the other side.
161;641.0;5.0;16.0;"This is one of the greatest movies ever. It shows vividly how fragile the line between ""freedom"" and ""tyrany"" is (to quote Bush's best loved terms). Who has freedom? Who is the tyrant? Does the US Patriot Act protect the freedom of ordinary Americans? Why did the Bush go against the majority of the UN to go into Iraq? Why do so many Americans still believe the infamous ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" will still be found? Why do so many Americans still blindly follow a man like Bush, who most people outside the US despise (yes, including myself)?\n\nMichael Moore shows Bush at his worst, and shows why its so good not to be an American right now.\n\nThe really scary thing about this movie is to read all the 1-star reviews here on Amazon.

I left the theater feeling like I had been manipulated and force-fed an ultra-liberal's agenda.\n\nIt was touted as a ""documentary"", yet the purpose of a documentary is to present an unbiased and neutral view of a subject illustrated with historical facts. ""Farenhiet 9/11"" does nothing of the sort. It's a propoganda film, full of slant.\n\nMoore IS funny, in a way, and he did a good job with piecing together lots of footage in such a way that made The President look bad. I have to admit, I DID chuckle at a few things. But, if I were given hours of footage of Senator Kerry, in day-to-day life, I'd have had no problem at all putting him in a bad light.\n\nI don't know what the big deal was regarding the length of time Bush spent at the school upon news of the attacks on 9/11. What was he supposed to do? Freak-out all the little kiddies and announce to them that America was under attack by terrorists and, as a result, he had to leave immediately? Not an issue.\n\nIn the end, no propoganda film was ever going to remove The President of the United States from the White House.

Also see ""Fog of War"" with Robert S McNamarra, see ""Bush's Brain"", read history, view the timeline - It all fits perfectly. I'll tell you what makes Moore such a good story teller: Reality! Its all documented and available. Pull your heads out of the sand and look it up. To those of you who said: ""Wake Up, America."" - I echo 1000 times.\n\nWe have been duped again.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice ...";If the shoe fits...
377;652.0;1.0;16.0;So let's see here: for all the predicament of the Iraq war, for all the dodgy and ultra suspicious happenings, hampered investigations for 911, for all the innocent lives lost both from the american perspective and the world in general, for the quaqmire of the american economy, well, basically for everything we can blame it all on one person. Da current president.\n\n  Michael Moore either doesnt understand or pretends not to, that the system under which the U.S functions does so despite of particular persons. Nothing much would change had Kerry for example been elected and to propagandise the opposite is actually naive and suspicious in itself. Capitalism, communism, whichever such system based on classes functions the way it does regardless of who's in power.\n\n  The fact that this is ignored by Moore who launches a rather cheap offensive on Bush as if he is the critical part of the puzzle is enough to dismiss his film alltogether as populistic propaganda to be consumed only by the politically uneducated.\n\n  If one thing impressed me about this film is that Moore does touch (at the beginning) some thorny issues only to suddenly leave them be and proceed making jokes about Bush being on vacation too much. But Moore and anybody for that matter would also be on frequent vacation if his agenda was going according to plan and if he wasn't really needed to begin with. And lastly, there are more facts being ignored on this film than the ones actually revealed.\n\n  Moore is without a shred of a doubt a great entertainer as well as a very good filmmaker. But a political mind he's not, at least not a deep-delving one which is exactly where his problem lies: he has convinced himself that he's both.;Does more harm than good...
114;653.0;1.0;15.0;It's obvious that Michael Moore hates President Bush with a passion.  It's also obvious that this clearly anti-Bush propaganda film was completely ineffective in taking any votes away from Bush in his 2004 re-election bid.\n\nOr, if this pseudo-documentary WAS effective, then Bush would have actually gotten even MORE than the 62-million votes he received had it not been released?  Interesting.\n\nSpeaking of elections, my favorite part of this entire film was watching Vice President Al Gore telling the mostly black congresswomen protesting the election certification to sit down and shut-up unless they could get at least one Democratic Senator to agree with their protest.  They couldn't.  Gore seems almost contemptuous of their efforts to keep his presidential bid alive.  He looks almost embarrassed.  But I guess Michael Moore didn't notice that, or why would he have included it in a film that was supposed to be blasting Bush?;I finally watched this one on cable.
407;654.0;4.0;16.0;Of course this is a biased movie, but Moore poses many FACTS that you can draw your own conclusions on. The conservatives are outraged by this movie because it shows the dirty side of their leader. Sorry the truth is so hard for them to swallow.\n\nI'm so tired of conservative rhetoric being thrown about. F9/11 was a refreshing film that finally gave a voice to the people who have been seeing through these lies for years now. Bush may have won this past election, but Moore's work gave the alliance against the regieme more conviction.\n\nTHE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD!;Biased: yes. Truthful: more than the right likes to admit.
412;655.0;1.0;16.0;I'm glad that the rest of America cannot be swayed by a left-wing propagandist the way Jeff Shannon can. There is a big country out there between NYC and San Francisco.

432;657.0;5.0;16.0;"Politics is the only professional sport I follow; however, I really love a good documentary.  I am Canadian and I didn't have much respect for Michael Moore after hearing I had been living in a national paradise all my life - as he promoted in ""Bowling for Columbine.""  My dim view of his film making ability is entirely reversed by ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""\n\nMoore has made a film that really transends the documentary genre.  Everybody agrees that films like ""Thin Blue Line"", ""Radio Bikini"", and ""Fog of War"" are all incredible - I have seen them a number of times.  Fahrenheit 9/11 leaves them in a dustbin as far superior.\n\nThis film provokes a lot of emotion, that is was distinguishes it from most documentaries that stir up only outrage, horror or intellectual sadness; although the movie brings in all those feelings in too.  The film doesn't have the professional polish of a production like the ""Fog of War"" but I think that is intentional - it is clear Moore's object is the superficial productions and the polished presentation of the government Moore dislikes so strongly.\n\nGranted, I am more sympathetic to Moore's political stance than perhaps a conservative American would be.  I do have the perspective of my American and typically Republican voting wife to add objectivity to my review.\n\nI really did laugh at some parts: John Ashcroft singing is really funny.  The movie provoked the fear of September 11th without images, leaving the experience as personal and as unique as each viewer.  I cried like a grandmother at the horrors of war and the parallels between the Iraqi woman and the Michigan mother.\n\nFew dramatic movies have done what ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" has done.  I can more than sympathize with the political obstacle faced by a conservative viewer would have to appreciate this movie.  I have no doubt that it is the greatest documentary I have ever seen.\n\nThis is a must see movie.";I laughed, I cried, I was afraid . . .
446;658.0;5.0;16.0;This movie is a MUST see for everyone.  And than after the movie, please form your own opinion of the FACTS that are presented in the film.  Each person has their own views on if the President is the man to be in office.  Just like each person should form their own opinion of this film without name calling and degrading people or their stances.  If you would like to see a well down flick that presents facts, yes facts, they can and are proven in this film, and if you have the intellect to process the information presented and make your own decision and argue that reasonably than this film is a good watch.  Humans are rational people that are capable of making sound decisions, lets start acting like that and this country and world would be a much better place!;Alright lets look at the movie, not your party....
462;659.0;1.0;16.0;I think Michael Moore is a giant wuss whom is mad at the US for not giving him everything in life.  To fat and overweight to do anything include going the military to comprehend how the world really works outside of his house and from behind him Television.  I rate this 1 star because it was poorly put together and missing a lot of important information.  Only a quarter of the information is presented to the viewer.;Michael Moore
534;660.0;5.0;16.0;"I have seen the movie in the theatre and purchased the DVD.  I think M. Moore has achieved his goal with this movie.  In it, the viewer is confronted with different opinions and information than the normal drivel we are supplied by many of the ""news"" organizations.  After seeing this movie I began investigating what had been presented and discussing it with others, the main point of this documentary.  Many citizens of this country have become extremely complacent, allowing our government and the media to feed us our thoughts and needs.  This movie has rattled our psyche and it has made it use the best tool we have, our brains.\n\nA good follow up to this movie is to go and read the Wolfowitz Doctrine (can be accessed on PBS website).  If you watch the movie again it might put it in a new perspective for you, moreover you might need a pair of Michael Moore's free underwear.";Mission Accomplished - Really!
563;661.0;5.0;16.0;For those who say this film is nothing but a bag of lies, please point out exactly where those lies are. We all know that Moore is a bit of a windbag and can exagerrate (for instance, the segment detailing pre-war Iraq as a child-friendly wonderland is too much to believe)- but behind all of the bluster there is a solid foundation in fact. And if you're going to claim that the film is nothing but lies, try actually... I don't know... WATCHING the film first.\n\nFrom Saudi oil friendships... to inattention in office... to corporate conventions to decide who gets what part of Iraq's remains... to the pain of parents whose child died for no good reason... to the manipulation of the American public by fear and terror... It's just a shame. It makes me embarrased and ashamed to be an American.\n\nThe general sense I get about Bush is that he is out of touch with reality, while his admistration and family know *exactly* what they're doing and uses him as a mere figurehead. Whether Bush is a knowing conspirator playing dumb or an unwitting accomplice who is genuinely incompetent, I am not certain. What I am certain of is that this man does not deserve the presidency.\n\nI am not a liberal. I am not a democrat. I am not a republican. I am simply a person who wants the best for my country, and that is not something that seems to be on Bush's mind.\n\nI voted for Bush in 2000. I will not make that mistake again - a decision not based on this film but definitely strengthened by it.;If there are lies, please point them out
579;662.0;5.0;16.0;"Thank God for Michael Moore!  He's a true American hero and this film proves it.  I especially liked how he emphasized the Bush/Saudi connection.  There's several gruesome scenes that aren't for people with weak stomachs, but they help to tell the story like it really is.  As an American citizen, you would always like to believe that your Government is trustworthy and does the right thing, but this film shows just how untrustworthy the Government can be.  It makes you realize that if you, as an average citizen, don't take control of your government, the government will take control of  you.  It wasn't like the film suddenly turned me anti-Bush; I was against him ever since he stold the last election from Gore.  It just added many more reasons to support my views.  I think that anyone who watches this film and still plans to vote for Bush is in great need of a trip to the nuthouse.";A real eye-opener
581;663.0;4.0;16.0;Michael Moore has built his reputation on exposing corporate misdeeds and government corruption.  This movie is an obvious attack on Bush, but one that fails to provide much investigation into what really happened to facilitate the events of 9-11 and America's descent into fascism.  Also, Moore represents a voice for the communist-socialist critique of fascism (fascism being nationalist-socialist) - a tyranny that professes to be benevolent challenging one that appears elitist and arrogant.  Moore starts off with the 2000 election, displaying sympathy for the Al Gore cause (which is not a way to start a documentary if you wish to appear objective).  As he moves into 9-11 and its aftermath, he has a lot of entertaining and heart-wrenching material to lay on the viewer.  Moore is clever at putting together music, video, and voice overs to create a compelling story in this way.  However, he fails to present a lot of evidence about government complicity and elite agendas which can be found in independently distributed documentaries that have been produced about 9-11.  Moore's film only scratches the surface of a dark, disturbing story, and allows the viewers to think they have now been informed about Bush & 911 and that the situation can be improved by going out to vote for Bush's Democratic election opponent, a member of the same secret society and elite network that pull Bush's strings.  This film is vintage Michael Moore, and hopefully it will stir some people to start doing independent research into history and current events, a type of research that goes beyond entertainment and clever juxtapositions of sound and video footage.;Clever, But Flawed Political Documentary
598;664.0;5.0;16.0;"President Bush is the wrong man in the White House! Michael Moore's film was extraordinary and it shows that President Bush lied to the American people. Why would he go to Iraq and capture Sadaam and he wasn't even the one who committed the 9/11 attacks, it was Al Queda in Afghanistan. Afghanistan/Iraq have no connections and he swore that Sadaam had weapons of mass destruction! And troops were sent over there to die for nothing and it was sad to see the Limpscomb family hurt about there child's death. They haven't found any weapons of mass destruction and troops and civilians are dying for nothing! People are getting beheaded and so forth. There was an interesting scene in the film where Moore and the marine tried to hand out flyers for the military to the Congressman to see if they would send there children in harms way! You should have saw the look on the Congressmans face. That whole administration is corrupt and Moore did a very good job of letting out the truth! And why didn't they have cameras in the room when the 9/11 COMMISION INTERVIEWED PRESIDENT BUSH AND DICK CHEANEY?? There is a special feature with Condellezza Rice answering questions from the 9/11 Commission and she said, ""BUSH WAS AWARE OF THE SECURITY REPORT FROM THE FBI BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11."" But Bush was too focused on playing golf at his ranch in Texas! 9/11 could have been prevented and Moore gets a standing ovation from me on this film because it is the truth! What is America coming to if Bush is elected again? By me reading some of these reviews, people are just blinded that Bush is a liar and that he is corrupt just like his dad! Great film and I wish Micahel Moore the best!";INFORMABLE FILM
614;665.0;1.0;16.0;The problem with this country is that thier is no respect for our leaders anymore. This movie already adds to the long list of things the terrorists (or bad people) have to use against us. The sad thing is that a lot of Americans will believe this garbage. I do not disagree with everything in this movie. I only disagree with its delivery and the Liberal (Half-truth) approach by Mr Moore. I am one of the ones who has been serving on the front lines and I have been serving for over 17 years so I know the truth first hand. Bottom line is if you want to waste your money and believe in an anti-American who speaks from a Liberal standpoint only, then this movie is for you......;WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!
629;666.0;1.0;16.0;This movie would be laughable and otherwise ignorable if it wasn't for Michael Moore's attempt at trying to manipulate facts to change the outcome of an election. He is perpetuating a deception on the American people through this movie. His distoraiton and outright lies of facts is deplorable.

The director shows you the facts about what's going in Iraq and President Bush.  There are some things I disagree with of course, but there are things in here that would make any rational person reconsider voting for President.  The neo-cons are distorting the film's message and the only way you're going to know the truth about it is to see it.  Of course the Republicans are going to say it's a lie!  Why wouldn't they?

Go ahead, I dare you to research this information and realize that you're a dumb a**.  Its sad what America has come to.  Have you all forgotten the tragedy of 9/11?  Do you really want someone who changes their mind every 5 minutes running the country?  Or do you want someone who isn't scared to use force to protect us, our families and our children.

People who have taught us time and again it is OK to forge documents and edit film events no matter what the FACTS are. Contrary to Moore's belief system, things were not all kite-flying and wonderful with Saddam Hussein.  Check out the book SADDAM: KING OF TERROR by Con Coughlin for a reality check.  Coughlin did his research on Saddam Hussein before the war.\n\nMichael Moore is a lying hate-monger.  Don't let him polute your mind.;WHY WOULD YOU WATCH SOMETHING YOU KNOW TO BE UNTRUE?

818;676.0;5.0;16.0;I'm a well-educated (2 advanced degrees) and well-infomed former Marine Corps officer and I thought I'd seen and read everything there was to know about the war in Iraq, 9/11 and terrorism. I was wrong. This documentary opened my eyes to many facts that left me and my wife absolutely dumfounded. It was also very funny in places and generally very entertaining. I don't agree with all of Moore's conclusions, but the main thrust of his film, the deceits and treachery of the Bush Administration, are incontrovertible and have never been disproved by the Wing Nuts who claim he's a liar. You owe it to yourself and your country to see this amazing film.;Amazing and Entertaining Documentary
830;677.0;5.0;16.0;...but it definitely deserves Best Picture! It is poetic, beautiful and poignant. It allows its subject all the rope it needs to hang itself and then, without invective, allows us to pull the noose tight ourselves. It's Mike's best movie because he stays to the side allowing the events to speak for themselves. Anyone who says this movie is a bunch of lies has not seen it. It is mostly a collage of images that have been woefully absent in the major media since day one. There is very little commentary from Moore, there doesn't need to be. And everything is well documented and vindicated by the 911 commissions own report...;Maybe this movie doesn't deserve Best Documentary...
831;678.0;4.0;16.0;I saw this movie in the theater and have read 200 of the reviews already posted on this site before posting my own.  I soon noticed that people who gave poor reviews to the film stated how much the film lied and how biased it was. You can make those statements but you have to support them. It's not enough to say the film tells lies, you need to tell us what the lies are and support your claim with evidence. Few reviews do this. Also, many of the people who gave the film one or two stars admit to not watching the entire film, some admit to not watching it at all.\n\nThis documentary does a good job, if anything, of raising questions. It explores the connections of our current government to big oil companies currently at work in Iraq and Afghanistan, it explores connections between the Bush family and Saudi Arabia, it explores the social and economical makeup of the kids surving in our military, and it explores our efforts on the homefront to keep our country safe post 9/11.\n\nWas there some fancy editing? Of course. Every good movie has good editing. Were there some lies told? Of course there was. The decision to pull the Bin Laden family out of The U.S. after the attacks was not Bush's. One of the great things about our system of government is that through checks and balances, Bush, or any president, does not have that power. Be smart enough to realize you're being lied to, but then ask yourself why you hadn't heard of any of this before the movie came out. Who's hiding what?\n\nAlso, anyone blaming George W. for the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center wasn't paying attention in 1993. Remember, the car bomb in the basement that injured a few hundred people? Bin Laden had an obsession with the WTC and wanted it gone, and would stop at nothing to get it done. In my own mind, I assume that Bin Laden attacked on 9/11 not because he hated George W., but because he failed to level the buildings in 1993 and it took him almost nine years to come up with a plan that would work. If Gore had been in office on 9/11, the buildings still would have been attacked and we would have tapes of Gore sitting in a classroom instead of Bush. Michael Moore draws some of his own conclusions in this film and I did notice how careful he was to point out his own opinions when he wasn't presenting fact. I encourage anyone watching this film to draw their own conclusions as well.\n\nThis film does do a good job of raising questions about our current government. At times it gets long and drawn-out. At times it gets confusing. The plot at times jumps around like a Quentin Tarantino piece and doesn't always make it back to home base.\n\nOnce again, unlike most who reviewed this, I'm not making a political statement. I have no left or right wing. I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet. I'll wait until after the debates to do that, as any American should. If Bush is as dumb as this film makes him out to be, it will show in the debates. Keep in mind that even if you come away from this movie hating George W., you have to ask yourself if Kerry can do a better job, this movie doesn't do that for you. If you walk away from this movie and don't have some serious discussions with your friends about it - whether you agree with it or not, I think you've missed the point.;A review of the movie, not a political statement.
843;679.0;1.0;16.0;I've never seen anything so cleverly edited to present only one side of issues. The total goal of this film is to totally distort facts to impune our President. Anyone who sees this film and allows their opinion to be influenced is foolish. Mr Moore has a vendetta against Mr. Bush and will do or say anything to bring him down. I cannot recommend such a destructive and one sided film.;A Bunch of Lies

872;681.0;4.0;16.0;Michael Moore is the type of man who has his fair share of detractors as well as supporters, but don't let that deter you from watching this movie.\n\n  The film begins with footage of jubilant Democrats celebrating what they believe to be the victory of Al Gore as the new President of the United States of America, but alas, that happiness is short-lived with the startling news that, in fact, GEORGE W BUSH IS THE NEW PRESIDENT!\n\n  How did this debacle happen? How could a spoilt, over grown child like George W Bush possibly succeed the intelligent and sophisticated President Clinton as President of the most powerful nation in the world? Simple, get your brother and some of your Daddy's friends help you cheat on the vote recount in the state of Florida, where your brother happens to be the governor, and convince Dad's friends in the Supreme Court to rule in your favour in spite of glaring oversights, and blatant evidence of voter tampering.\n\n  Cut straight to the blackest day in the history of the 21st century, and we see footage showing that on the day the Twin Towers were destroyed, George was visiting a primary school to read with the kids (assuming the man had the intelligence to read as well as the kids!). And while the nation was in a state of sheer naked panic, George just sits there in the classroom and barely blinks an eye.\n\n  The second half of the film then concentrates on the Iraqi battleground, and the very human cost of war. The most poignant moment of the film is Lila Lipscombe reading the last letter her son wrote her from the Iraqi field before he was killed in action. He tells her that he and the other troops don't know why they are there, they don't want to be there, they all just want to come home to their families.\n\n  But perhaps the most galling aspect of this film, second to the gruesome images from Iraq, are the existence of a business relationship between the Bush and Bin Laden families. The implication being that this war on Iraq was instigated in order for Bush and co. to make millions (billions?!), but all at the expense of 3000 innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001.\n\n  Many detractors have gone for the juggular, and accused Moore of fabricating many facts, some going as far as accusing Moore of telling outrageous lies. But prior to seeing this film I read several books regarding this subject, one of them was 'September 11' by Noam Chomsky, 'Five Biggest Lies Bush Told Us About Iraq' by Christopher Scheer, Robert Scheer and Lakshmi Chaudry just to name a few. These books had already exposed Bush for the sycophantic bully that he is.\n\n  And yes, I for one hope that he falls flat on his arse by losing the next election.\n\n  For anyone out there who was skeptical about the connection between Al_queda and Saddam, or if you wondered how did it go that Osama Bin Laden was deemed responsible for September 11, and yet somehow, Bush suddenly declared war on Iraq WATCH THIS MOVIE.\n\n  Just a point of interest, the Bush administration claimed there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and the Al-Queda group based on the fact that Mohamed Atta (one of the leading hijackers) was in Prague the same time an Iraqi official was visiting the city of Prague. There were several claims that they held a meeting, but oddly enough, the 'sources' which claimed that they spoke at length were untraceable to all. And there has never been any evidence that the two men ever met, only that they were in the same city at the same time.\n\n  So, like I said, watch this movie yourself, and decide whether or not the real axis of evil (Bush, Blair and Howard) deserve to win their respective elections or not.\n\n  Another four years? More like another 6 weeks for Bush.;The Awful Truth, the sequel

Do you people even know what the word ""propaganda"" even means, well here is the definition given by Websters Dictionary, ""False information or ideas methodically spread to promote or injure a cause, group, or nation."" Now nothing that Moore has said in any of his films is false information! How can something be propaganda when it comes from the sources mouth? One reviewer commented on Bush commenting on the terrorists and then saying ""watch this drive"" without missing a beat by saying, ""cant he golf and not be bothered?"". NO he cant! He is the president, he should have not commented on his golf swing at all, he should have sayed what he sayed about the terrorists then went on his way. By saying what he sayed the way he said it, it makes him look like he doesn't care and his golfing is more important. Michael Moore is not anti-american, he just wants a better America! One reviewer commented about the woman who lost her son in the war by saying that her son signed on to the military voluntarily. Yes it is true that he did sign on of his own free will, but once you are in the military OWNS you and you do what they say. She was protesting Bush for carelessly sending people to die for an unjust war! He signed up for the military, but not to die for no reason.\n\nMichael Moore is a truth seeker not a propagandist, sometimes the truth hurts. If you want to be a drone and just do and beleive everything that Bush says, then you are a fool.

913;686.0;5.0;16.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 has been thoroughly dismissed by the Bush administration for its provocative insinuations. Notwithstanding the documentary is a valuable alternate look at a presidential office that has skillfully abused and manipulated information and power. Any impartial observer will be able to detect that the Bush administration has never been nor intends to become forthcoming in sharing the truth with the American people. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a much needed counterweight to the Bush's media campaign of war rhetoric and terror alert propaganda. If you want to become informed and understand both sides of the Bush administration - its public image and private affairs - then Fahrenheit 9/11 is a must see.;A Must See for Every American
942;687.0;4.0;16.0;"The most disturbing thing about this film is the reaction to it, especially by those who refuse to see it and only rely on their partisan support of President Bush as a means of judging it.  Having read extensively about most of the historical material, I really did not see much with which I was not familiar.  I was very grateful to Moore, however, for encapsulating this information into a 2 hour film and presenting it in a form which those unfamiliar with it could easily digest. I would have preferred that the entire film was an examination of the various connections between the Bush family, Arbusto/Harkin, Saudi Arabia, OBL, Halliburton, 9/11, etc.  If you are one of those for whom this information is completely unworthy of being seen because you will never believe there to be any connection (despite painstaking and extensive verification) then you should see the film and be pleasantly surprised that the whole film is NOT about these things.  On the other hand, if you are afraid that the very real words (on tape) of your own candidate will be used against him and his political allies, then do NOT see this film.  You will surely die of shame when you see what kind of unredeemedly inept, heartless and devious person it is that you so fervently support! Conversely, if you think that Iraq was equivalent to Afghanistan in the ""War on Terror"" then you will surely enjoy reliving the bombardment of Baghdad and be able to easily overlook the heartache caused to the families of those who have been lost in the war. In fact, you will find that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is as All-American as John Ashcroft singing ""Let the Eagle Soar"" at the Fourth of July picnic!  You should not be afraid of Michael Moore's documentary!  Any  discomfort or fear you have should actually spring from seeing the words and actions of your own president, as these are what this film is made of.";A Native Texan trying to be obective!
962;688.0;4.0;16.0;Michael Moore always has a witty way to approach things such as his ice cream truck stunt (where he reads the PATRIOT act to congress through an ice cream truck's speakers because they didn't read it). It really get's you thinkin' which is good today because it seems that there is so much dribble on TV and in the movies, but his fight is very one-sided.\n\nI suggest that anyone, be you Republican, Democrat or Green, that see's this movie also read what the Republican-Conservative enemy has to say as well. Slander-By Ann Coulter is a pretty fierce Conservative book that combats many of the things people like Al Franken and Michael Moore say. Just do your own research as well as watch this movie and develop you own opinion to the topics it brings up.;Excellent Movie, but get Both Sides of the Story
983;689.0;4.0;16.0;"In this country, we're supposed to be able to voice our own opinions freely, without fear of reprisal.  But it seems that freedom of speech is a hotly contested controversy, along with liberty and justice for all.  What a country.\n\nThe movie was very good, but it did not surprise me at all.  I feel that people who keep their eyes open and pay attention, and know how to weed out the media propaganda that we are all exposed to each and every day on television, newspaper and magazine media, etc., would see or have seen for themselves.\n\nI decided after Bush was ""selected"" that I would never vote again.

985;690.0;1.0;16.0;Again, Moore skews the facts to create the illusion of being a real documentary.  But he cuts up footage and uses answers to one question to answer a different question.  The facts have all been challenged and found a lie.  Also, a documentary provides both sides to an issue and lets the viewer decide.  This is an anti-American propaganda film.\n\nHe took an anti-American film to the most anti-American country in the world and won an award.  Wow... big shocker there.\n\nAs far as politics are concerned, Moore won't go on any shows that won't give him a list of questions before hand for a reason.  He's a dolt and not only has no education beyond what he cheated through in high school, but has no political background just like the other wacko hollywood types.\n\nBetter cling to this DVD.  When Bush wins 4 more years, this is all you'll have to get you through your crying fits at night.\n\nI'd have give this less than 1 star due to it not being factual but Amazon wouldn't let me.\n\np.s.

987;691.0;1.0;16.0;I am always surprised by what a gentleman Mr. Moore presents himself as when interviewed.  Heck, I'd almost be willing to break bread with him if given the chance.  Given that I have familial Hollywood connections, it's certainly not out of the question.  I've been trying to contact Mr. Moore for an interview to appear in my company newsletter.\n\nOf course, much of the controversy surrounding Michael Moore and his films is due to the questionable status of his citizenship.  I don't want to rehash the topic, as talk radio hosts have debated it to death.  But whether or not he is able to legally work within the U.S. is neither here nor there.  We know he lives in the States, and therefore he poses a danger to the country.\n\nThe single-star rating is applicable if his film is taken as a serious documentary.  As a fantasy/comedy film, I'd give it four billion stars.;Deport Michael Moore!
990;692.0;1.0;16.0;I have read almost all of the reviews and find many of them very entertaining. More entertaining than the movie actually. What is funny is the people who say they made up their political minds because of a movie. When you saw the movie Independence Day, did you leave the major cities for fear of an alien attack?  There are some truths in the documentary. There are also some twisted truths and some outright lies. To make up your politcal mind based solely on this is frightening. People will go to vote based on this and this alone for someone to run our country?\n\nMoore, by creating this documentary, had only one thing in mind. I do not even believe it was to reshape the minds of many. It was simply to make money. Has Bush made mistakes as the film suggests, absolutely. Would I rather have a Republican in the time of war, most definately. Do I think the Iraq war was a mistake, yes. We should have done it right the first time and finished the job.\n\nThe one thing I have always been glad to know and see is that most liberals or simply chronic complainers are good for not voting when the time comes. At least there is some relief in knowing that so a President does not get elected simply because of a documentary created by one person.;Movie To Help Make Up Your Political Mind
1001;693.0;5.0;16.0;"This movie is one that i would recomend to all Americans. It gives you a good look at ""W"" and how he has mislead us to belive that we needed to go to a war. A war based on his and his dady's beliefs. Most of the things in the movie, you would have already known, had you have watched any news source rather than FOX, but it also gives you a deeper look behind the curtin in wich the media has tried to cover up. Altho some things are exagerated, it is for the most and main part, true facts.\n\n  Its funny to see all these ultra-conservitaves try to write a review on this movie. Seeing as you can tell by reading the reviews that they have not seen this video. These are the kinda people that make me sick, all they do is listent to people like Bill O'Riley, who tell you not to watch this movie, based on lies that Bill spits, and they carry the message. Bill, and other Fox corespondents, spit out right-wing propaganda constantly. Now you may say ""well this here movie is propaganda!"" but it all depends on how you look at it. I think everyone should see it no matter what there political standpoint is. Wether you hate it, or love it, it will give you something to talk about.\n\n  Now I'm not a person who only watches and reads leberal movies and books, I enjoy looking at both sides of things. Dont think that I just chater about the evils of dubya. To tell the truth i don't know if Gore could have been the best President. The truth is nobody is perfect, and we will never have the perfect President. They will all make mistakes. But Bush has made one too many mistakes and ones that are major. War is something that should only be done in times were it is the only answer. Oil and money, are not good reasons for war. I wouldn't even call this a war. I pray every night for our troups, and wish them the best of luck, but we can't let this war go on.\n\n  Ive been rambling on and need to stop. I hope you will all buy or rent this movie.

This is nothing more than an irrational ""I hate Bush and I don't care if I'm logical about my argument because my hatred is enough to make my feelings valid"" vehicle for people who don't want to think and prefer to just surrender their minds to any popular demogogue.

I told them to see for themselves and make up their own minds after seeing 911. and I bet them that they would think differently.

1123;696.0;1.0;16.0;This movie is a well made propaganda piece, similar to the infamous Triumph of the Will.  It is intended for one purpose only, and that is to bring about the removal of President Bush from office.  Given that goal, no low is too low for Moore.\n\nThere are innumerable sources that show the factual errors in this movie.  (...)\n\nMake no mistake, it is a powerful movie.

1167;698.0;4.0;16.0;"There's a certain irony in the fact that this movie is giving FOX News commentators (and viewers, apparently, if the commentary below is any indication)such a case of apoplexy. Definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle cracked.\n\n Sure it's slanted, but you know what? Some of us are grown-ups and we can decide for ourselves what's factual and what may be specious. And believe me there is nothing here any less specious than one gets in a typical evening of FOX News broadcasting!\n\n What David Brock has labeled ""the Great Republican Noise Machine"" has steadily been eroding debate in this country by successfully intimidating the ""liberal media"" into giving this president a virtual pass. People like Moore, at least, offer something of a corrective on this score. It's refreshing to see that, yes, there are still impassioned, unintimidated liberals out there. And whether you're particularly liberal or not, I hope at least, you might concede that America needs the dialogue.\n\n But of course, in this widely polarized nation, there may be little chance that this film or any other (or any one of the many books published by liberal OR conservative authors) will ultimately succeed in doing much more than preaching to the choir. There is some faint hope that--precisely because this movie is such a phenomenon--that it may spark some useful dialogue though. One can hope at least.";See It With Someone You Love!

I believe when you consider the similarities of the events which bring nations to war (ie Pearl Harbor, WTC,...)it becomes painfully clear there is a consistancy for media distortion, falsehoods from government heads and many other things which help to sway public opinion. Go to the library, read some accurate history books, think things over and then decide if our leaders are being elected in truth and justice and are really serving the best interests of the citizen, or whether they are serving the intrests if the civilization which in the end is nothing more than the few who have sublime control over the masses.";A New Form of Coercion

As I recall, they went something like this:\n\n ""Many families have been devastated tonight. This just is not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him! Boston, New York, DC, and the planes' destination of California--these were places that voted AGAINST Bush!\n\n These comments made me realize just how deceptive this jerk is. Then his comments at the Cannes Film Festival reaffirmed this notion, that Michael Moore is an oppurtunistic, selfish individual who truly hates this country.

Perhaps Moore's critics don't understand that there is no REAL truth. Covering something from all angles, be it a war, an argument or a misunderstanding doesn't lead to pure truth, only confusion.\nIt's no secret that Moore has an agenda with this film. And I agreed with it long before I saw it. The point is President Bush must not be re-elected. And Moore gives us hundreds of reasons why. However it's the manipulation of the editing and arranging of montages that prevent the film from having any real dignity or class. Sure there is a sense of humor and huge understanding of American politics (you MUST pay attention to every last word) but Moore's point is too biased to really connect with me. Not that I think Bush deserves any sympathy or a second (or 1, 345, 456th) chance. It's just that his intentions come across too forcefully.\nYes, the war in Iraq is unjust and the biggest lie and waste of human life since the Vietnam catastrophe. And all for what? For money, nothing more than paper. If we ever come through this will we trust the Government again? Most ominously not. After watching this film will you ever trust the Government again? I promise you...you won't!\nThere are some powerful scenes, a woman breaking down in tears reading a letter from her dead son who died in Iraq for Bush's greed, every Senator Moore meets refusing to sign their children up for the Army while poor black kids from the projects willingly sign up, the charred bodies of US soldiers being dragged through the streets in Iraq. But the most effective part of the film was also the most ingenious. The opening to Fahrenheit 9/11 plays the sounds of planes crashing into the WTC on a black screen. Powerful effects without the use of images at all. Why? We've seen it so many time we need not see it again. Because terrorism is blind. Out of respect for people sensitive for such images being exploited yet again. And to heighten our awareness of the horror of just screaming and panic and the cheapening of human life.\nThere are parts of this film that will rile you up and enrage you, be it the skillful arranging of facts or the ignorant bystander calling the woman crying over her dead son 'staged'. Sadly though, it wanders off the point in the middle and kind of sags.\nIf it had been leaner then I wouldn't have gotten so impatient. But as it stands Fahrenheit 9/11 is an unapologetic firestorm designed to rip right through the Whitehouse and the Senate.

The facts that Moore details in this film, the myriad of connections between the Bush family and powerful families in Saudi Arabia, including the bin Ladens, the events surrounding the virtual overthrow of free and fair elections in 2000, the lies promoted by the administration in order to promote a pre-planned war with Iraq, the feeble attempts to bring to justice those responsible for the attacks and gross mismanagement of the so-called war on terror, the rape of the US constitution and erosion of civil liberties after 9-11, the ignorance, hypocrisy, and above all the gross arrogance that President Bush and his cronies have displayed for the citizens of this country and the world, even if only 10% of it were true, would STILL make the Bush Administration (Corporation, perhaps, more fittingly) the most corrupt, devisive, disingenuous, immoral and socially destructive administration to ever hold power in the United States.\nGiven the current state of the American media, where the ability to question what our government tells us has know become almost non-existent, Moore's film comes as a much needed voice of reason and sanity at a time in American history that is most dark. Some may come away from this film thinking that the forces of evil will always triumph, which is understandable considering the events of the last four years; however, this film also shows that there are still many people willing to stand up and fight for those sacred American ideals of freedom and justice for all, no matter how determined the powerful interests are to silence them. As citizens in a free society it is our duty as Americans to be informed about the events that Moore chronicles and whether one is a republican, democrat or independent, it is every person's responsibility to face the ugly facts presented here. In this film Michael Moore has simply given a perspective that is all but dead in American journalism; it is up to each American to determine what those facts mean to us. No matter how strong the forces of evil seem to become, they can only attain and extend their power with the willing assent of the individuals in society, which is ultimately where the true power lies.

However, Michael Moore and particularly this documentary give me faith in the competence of those in whom we place so much faith.

But this film is deadly serious, and several times I was surprised to find myself wiping away tears. The battle scenes are raw and gut-wrenching--not the heavily edited material we see on the news. And his handling of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center was stunning. Even if you've seen the same footage countless times on television, Moore makes it feel as though you're experiencing it for the first time.\nI expected a lot of SNL-type potshots at the current administration. But, like an episode of PBS's ""Frontline,"" this film also presents well-documented investigative reporting that follows the money trail to very disturbing conclusions--which none of the principals have made any serious attempt to deny.\nHype aside, this is a gripping take on a subject that should interest all Americans, regardless of their personal political ideology.

Whether it is Halliburton, Enron, or Unocal, Bush seems to have a hand in every company that becomes famous for malfeasance.\nThe film was particularly effective in showing the lack of a connection between the September 11 hijackers and Iraq. It was continually surprising how Moore used the film medium to portray underlying truths that are so easily lost in a haze of jingoisting reporting and isolated bits of information.\nThis movie is a triumph, and it seems to open new avenues of creative and journalistic expression for filmmakers.;What USA Today didn't tell you...

Or are we a nation that brings health, security and prosperity to its citizens? Should the taxes paid by the american people support the american people? Or should they support a cabal of global war profiteers, energy barons and Zionist religious extremists? These are the questions we should be asking. Who are we as a people?

He has ketchup stains on his t-shirt. He is one of the little guys, and, unless you're a CEO or lawyer or lobbyist or other parasite,  that's YOU AND ME. God bless him, he's fighting for the right things, not just for the poor and disenfranchised, but for the 90% of America that's doesn't wake up in the morning and check their stock porfolios over breakfast.

It also peers into the strong influence of the Saudi government and it's awful human rights record and it's cozy relationship with the Bush dynasty and it's oil companies.\n Some of things I saw ranged from outrageous and horrifying to some being laughably funny especially with how low the officials in Washington really are.

In all honesty, people should never label someone as a 'liberal' or 'conservative' because the truth is is that people I believe are a mix of both political perspectives.

1388;715.0;1.0;16.0;The problem here is that Moore's films, this one included, are not really documentaries, they are propoganda.  Moore does not explore an issue, allow any opposing view unless it is ridiculed with the cheapest tricks of misleading editing.\nNow Mr. Moore has made a film that could effect the outcome of a presidential election, but are the points of his film true?  It doesn't seem to stand up well to serious fact checking.  To many people, the effect is politically expediant, and they are delighted, but is this really good for America?;The golden age of propoganda

1404;717.0;4.0;16.0;"One could sum up Fahrenheit 9/11 just by looking at its movie poster.  At the top it reads, ""Controversy...What Controversy?""  The documentary has received so much praise and scorn, that you would have had to have lived in a hole to not hear about this film.  Not since The Passion of the Christ have people felt so strongly for or against a film, let alone a documentary.  The ever so contentious political bad boy Michael Moore has created an ambiguous political satire that delivers punches and blows at our president, Mr. George W. Bush.\n Mr. Moore has always been famous for his political humor and wild ideas on film rather than his journalistic views in his documentaries.  He has been known to stretch the truth and not tell all truths in his film works.  Is there any difference in his new one?  No. Mr. Moore is still very good at manipulating his audience and persuading them to believe what he wants to believe.  But is this really a crime?  I don't think so because most documentaries hide a lot of truth due to the directors' willingness to do almost anything to get their point across.\n In saying that, I must admit this is Mr. Moore's best documentary. Though it may be one-sided, you have to respect Mr. Moore and all the time and effort he obviously put forth for this film.  He has gathered facts from various sources to describe the entire presidency of Mr. Bush (mostly concerning 9/11 and the Iraqi war).  In fact I think the biggest question the documentary poses to the audience is how Mr. Moore acquired some of the footage, documents, and facts for his film.  It would be interesting to see a documentary regarding how he obtained all his information.  It is unbelievable and really impressive to observe all the research he compiled in completing this documentary.\n It is at this point that the documentary becomes extremely one-sided.  Mr. Moore may make an interesting documentary, but his accolades come more from his political humor, not from his journalism.  Portions of the truth are told but not necessarily the entire truth.  In the documentary he mentions all the great countries we have supporting us in the Iraqi war.  This is where Moore's sarcastic humor, for which he is famous, enters in as he mentions only the less powerful countries we have on our side.  Of course Britain and Australia is not mentioned.  Why would Mr. Moore neglect to mention some of the powerful countries that are supporting us? Because it would not cause Mr. Bush to appear so incompetent.  Many more of these ""half-truths"" can be seen throughout the entire documentary.  But when a documentary is extremely one-sided as in the case as this one, one must realize at the outset that some truths will be stretched.\n As I have mentioned, Fahrenheit 9/11 is entertaining because of its political humor.  It is highly entertaining to see Mr. Moore drive around in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone to congress members heading to work.  The movie's funniest ""prank"" is when Mr. Moore takes to the streets asking members of congress if they would like for their sons or daughters to enlist in the army.  The reactions are priceless.  It's also hilarious watching some of the congress members flee when they discover it is Michael Moore pursuing them.  Obviously he has become a threat to them and they fear being embarrassed on camera.  It's amazing to see how one man can cause so much controversy.\n\n  Unlike his other films, Mr. Moore is almost absent in this documentary.  Except for the stunts already mentioned, he mostly serves as narrator and lets the footage speak for itself.  For this reason I believe it is his best documentary.  He has put aside performing outlandish, and in some ways ludicrous, stunts to concentrate more on staying the course of the content.  Less of Michael Moore has given the documentary more substance and feeling.  It's comical yet ironic watching Mr. Bush look at the camera and call for all nations to help stop terrorist killers, but then turn around and say, ""Watch this drive"" as he hits his golf ball down the fairway.  It's also disturbing to watch Mr. Bush on the morning of 9/11.  It was conveyed that he was in a classroom listening to young kids read when he was suddenly escorted out of the room when the planes crashed.  Yet on the footage, he is indeed not escorted suddenly.  He just sits there pondering while looking at a book until finally guards had to urge him out of the room.  It was wise of Mr. Moore to take a step back and let his footage speak for itself.  In this, his documentary becomes more meaningful and powerful.\n\n  The documentary drags somewhat at the end of the film, yet when it was over I was surprised that I found myself joining in applause with others in the theater.  This documentary, as with his others, is extremely well done and especially brings out good points and questions. Your opinion of Mr. Bush will probably not change with the content of this documentary.  If you love Mr. Bush, you will be offended.  If you hate him, you will cheer.  Yet, the fact remains you will have much to talk about afterwards.  In my opinion, a well-done documentary will lead a person to discuss viewpoints with others long after the completion of the film.  This demonstrates that whether or not you hated it or loved it, you cared enough about it to discuss it.  I recommend this movie to anyone who will be voting this year. Prior to voting, it's always important to hear both sides.  Here is an opportunity to hear one man's opinion on Mr. Bush and his administration.\n  Mr. Moore scores well again for his time and patience in research that has produced a documentary with plenty of well-educated, timely shots at Mr. Bush and congress while remaining funny and informative.

1443;718.0;5.0;16.0;First off, this movie is surprisingly funny in many parts.\nBut yes, it is a partisan movie aimed at showing the truth about Bush and his administration.\nI think this movie succeeds as it carefully builds on a set of facts to support Moore's point of view. You may disagree with the conclusions, but the facts are unimpeachable. It's interesting to see three years of events condensed into two hours. Only then does the Bush White House get revealed for what it is.\nPolitics aside, this movie is very well done.

I'll agree that it is definitely spun against Bush, but I seriously doubt that all of this info is false. With top White House aides and GOP House and Senate figureheads being indicted, combined with plummeting approval ratings, outrage at the Iraq war, and general unrest of the American people, it's obvious that the American public feels that it has been lied to by the Bush administration and Conservative talking-heads in the media about the so-called ""integrity"" of this administration. It looks like, with the truth beginning to reach the light of day, Michael Moore was actually a sort of visionary and had a great deal of courage to voice dissent against this presidency when it was very unpopular to do so. This film makes so much more sense now than it did a year ago.

This documentary is insightful, and an eye opener, how you take it is entirely up to you.\n\nI have read some other reviews, naturally, because I wanted to see what others thought about this documentary.. I must say, blindness must run rampant around here..\n\nOne comment was made, something along the lines of 'Oh, I was in Iraq and everytime a soldier dies it seems like Moore is doing it.' .. Oh, well that's nice, that comment made me cringe. What kind of blatant statement is that? Moore did not send the soldier's to Iraq, capitol interest and neo-con greed did.. Oh wah wah I know it's a tough thing to hear, and I know it would be easier to just deny it. It is funny how people still believe that our president truly believed there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and that was enough to plunge the country into near civil war. Companies most closely allied with the administration are 'strangely' profiting immensely from the war.. hmmm, the only people benefiting from this war.\n\nIt is truly a tragedy in this country when near half of the population have to lie to themselves to feel comfort.\n\nOh and about the bashes against Moore saying he is fat, #1 - that is a low blow without any real merit, #2 - he is an American, and 50% of America is fat, welcome to America.;'Controversial' Documentary?

354;728.0;5.0;15.0;"This film is quite brilliant. As Mike LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle commented, ""In the 90-year history of the American feature film there has never been a popular election-year documentary like this one."" The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Millions of people across the world have now seen the film.\n\nMoore tells us about the botched war against Al Qa'ida, and how the US state was completely unprepared for the attack, even though bin Laden had declared war on the USA in 1996. He details how the Bush administration, although repeatedly warned of an imminent attack, prepared no counter-attack and took an amazing two months to launch a military response.\n\nMoore reminds us that the 9/11 Commission found `no credible evidence' of any link between Iraq and Al Qa'ida. Vice-President Dick Cheney responded to this Report by repeating robotically that there was `overwhelming evidence'. President Bush added helpfully, ""The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and Al Qa'ida is because there was a relationship between Iraq and Al Qa'ida.""\n\nMoore denounces Bush and Blair's diversionary attack on Iraq, a country which has never attacked the USA or Britain and has never threatened to attack the USA or Britain. This unnecessary war of aggression has cost the USA more than a thousand soldiers' lives, and $166 billion, so far.";Outstanding exposure of George W.'s many failings

408;730.0;5.0;15.0;Farenheit 9/11 is a funny yet emotional and eye-opening film focusing on the Bush Adminastration's connection with Saudi-Arabia and their acts before and after the September 11th attacks. It's a gripping and involved satire that digs deeper than any other film that director Michael Moore has done. With media footage and file footage about Bush and others, the film covers a veriety of subjects, including the patriot act, Bush's past oil connections and others.\n\nMichael Moore does an amazing job of getting the facts to the view. Unlike his other films, Moore rarely appears on camera, letting the film clips and interviews speak for him. This let's the viewer get the full story, rather than just stare at some guy who is talking about Bush.\n\nThe emotion is high in this movie. Graphic scenes of war-devastated cities in Iraq, a collection of scenes with a mother mourning over her sons death in war, and a thought provoking look at Iraq in the month leading up to America's attacks. However, there a comical parts, and the film has a satirical edge. From stealing a ice cream truck to read the patriot act to Congress or playing back a stupid remark that Bush had said.\n\nThis film is genius. It's sad that it did not effect the election, but it is good to know that there are people like Michael Moore out there who still feel the need to change something. The braveness in this film and the unbelievable amounts of data collected in it's entirity make it a film like no other. A film that not only is based on facts, but based on human emotions. I recommend this film to anyone who loves films. It is a masterpiece and is definately one of the best movies of 2004.;Genius Film That Should've Helped Election

They think they are better and smarter than the rest of us and they have the answer. So you get is a laughable public display like this ""Documentary"" telling people what is right and what is wrong for them. Unfortunately there are many out there who can't think for themselves or filter out the BULL that believe this jackass and others like him.\n\nBut what they fail to understand is that people see and understand what is going on, They can see through all the Bull **** and they are very capable of filtering it and making a decision.

460;733.0;5.0;15.0;This film is a real splash of ice cold water.  Moore reveals his view of the potential motivations behind some of the recent political directions. This film attempts to answer many outstanding political questions about the U.S. and asks many more.\n\nThere are funny moments, there are sad moments, and there are very sad moments. Moore uses his fantastic sense of humour to lighten the deep and serious observations suggested.  I especially enjoyed his choice of music to make his point or add humour.\n\nThe film will grab you emotionally and forces you to ask: how did this happen and how could this happen?  It is almost impossible to not react to this film in a soul-searching manner.  No matter what your opinion is of Bush or Michael Moore, see this film!  It deserved the awards and accolades it won and it deserves the buzz it is creating.  More films like this should exist.  It will leave you spinning.;Interesting presentation of Moore's perspective
466;734.0;2.0;15.0;"I recently watched interviews with five of the people featured in this film.  Every one of them said that they were upset with the way they were represented.  Their replies were cut and manipulated to fit Mr. Moore's purpose and did not at all reflect what they were saying.  As a concept, I actually think that's kind of funny.  However, considering the subject matter, there arises a very dangerous possibility.\n\nI overheard some kids (who couldn't have been over fourteen or fifteen) talking about how The Pentagon wasn't really hit on 9/11.  One of them said that Iraq was going to become a U.S. territory and, oh yes, the draft was coming back.  After all that, they started talking about this film and how awful our president is and how they can't believe he's getting away with all of this.  Well, I'll tell you how...IT'S NOT TRUE.\n\nMichael Moore obviously has it in for Bush.  This work, obviously nowhere near a documentary, is intended to slander, degrade and persuade.  If it were a ""Daily Show"" or ""Saturday Night Live"" special, I would've probably liked it.";People STILL take this as fact
470;735.0;5.0;15.0;"From an apodictic point of view, i.e. from a point of view that is free of biases and outside of history, however unlikely the attaining of this state is, this work should not be called a documentary. No references are given for its claims, although the checking of the truth of these references may be very time consuming. As an example of this, the attempt by Moore to connect Karzai to Unocal is not substantiated. It would be very easy to give references to substantiate this claim, but he does not.\n\nBut from this (apodictic) viewpoint, however fanciful it might be, one can make judgments as to the authenticity of the content of F/911. In that sense F/911 could be viewed as providing motivation to perhaps produce a work that would either substantiate or nullify the claims made in F/911. Such reactionary works have already appeared, and have various degrees of quality, if judged from this (perhaps fanciful) apodictic point of view.\n\n Such a point of view (again, however fanciful) would permit one to make judgments as to the ""best"" or ""worst"" parts of F/911.  The best part of this work is the attempt by Moore to challenge Senators and House members to sign up their children for Iraq. This of course will not happen. Their sons and daughters do not sign up for combat. That wealthy people do not fight their own battles is an axiom of history. The worst part of the movie is the interview with a few U.S. troops, whose attitudes about offensive operations are presented as representing the majority of the troops stationed in Iraq. In the heat of battle, it is very understandable that they would need emotional props such as hard-rock music to get them through it.\n\nWhen viewing this part of the movie, one naturally wonders what Bush would do in such circumstances. His seven minutes of silence and inaction in the Florida classroom, as portrayed in this movie, instill skepticism in his ability to think decisively, independently, and rationally in situations of stress. One thing is sure, Bush has never had to face the intense emotions of war that these soldiers did. Bush has never had to say goodbye to his wife and children and then march to war. Bush has never had to make on-the-fly decisions in the horrific situations of combat. Bush has never had to bury a loved one killed in war. Bush has never been in a situation where death is constantly tugging at his elbow. This goes for Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and others in his cadre of yellow abdomens.\n\nIt would also be incorrect to call this movie ""propaganda"", as this is a term that should be reserved to societies whose governments are oligarchies or dictatorships. It is more appropriate in a democratic or pseudo-democratic society to form a new category or framework to characterize works such as these. This new category might be called ""political aesthetics"", and would be a branch of aesthetics, for, like art, it sometimes provokes strong emotions in the observer and spawns possibly many new genres. In addition, it can require both detachment and involvement to appreciate it fully. Some works of art require, for their appreciation, that individuals detach themselves from their feelings and prejudices, and in many instances view these works from an ahistorical point of view. Conversely, an appreciation of art sometimes requires deep personal involvement, and requires that one ignore external criticism and the opinions of others. In both cases, one cannot speak of the ""truth"" of these works of art. One can only speak of appreciating them. The most important point to remember here is that art can be sloppy as well as ordered, it can induce delight as well as pain, and it can instill respect as well as disgust. This work (of art) is no different than any other.\n\nWithout extensive research and statistical sampling, it would be difficult to say whether this movie will influence the decisions this Tuesday. But whatever the outcome, this movie will without a doubt be remembered as the most iconic of all those made in 2004. Could Moore have made the movie better than what it is? Perhaps. On Tuesday, will we be fooled again (as Moore asks at the end of the movie)? Perhaps. Can we improve on the current administration?\n\nAbsolutely.";A masterpiece of political aesthetics

522;737.0;1.0;15.0;"In this review I will attempt to see past my own political allegiances and concentrate merely on the film, as that is what reviews should focus on.\n\nFirst and Foremost:  I find this film to be abysmally bad.  I am not a fan of Michael Moore, but can at least appreciate some of his earlier work.  However, this film implodes on itself.\n\nThe film is structured in almost a 2 part format.  Part ""A"" the remarkable buffoonery of George W. Bush.  However, the rest of the film seems to paint W. as a manipulative evil genius.  For me, this is a painful contradiction.  How could someone so inept and visionless as one part suggests, still be clever and insightful enough to ""trick"" the entire country and propagate a regime?\n\nAnother qualm that I had is Moore's now trademark style of editing.  I find it to be ""MTV paced"" with quick cuts and loud music, and other auditory stimulation.  A good documentary should let interviews play out, allowing the audience to come to a conclusion based on their own interpretation and intelligence.  With all these quick cuts and eye candy, I feel as if the film tries to force a point (that may or may not have any merit), simply to cut away to another snippet of information (which may or may not be taken out of context)\n\nThe film is also sloppy...which there is a certain forgiveness to be had in all documentaries (and I would be the first to argue function over form).

At the same time there's some wry humorous moments laced within the serious push of the film. Because it's real(and no, not 'reality tv' real) it's happening.\n\nAnd hey Moore hired a gag of lawyers and non-partisan fact checkers for every sentence of his narrative. EVERY fact in this movie is true, yes his opinions are there too. If you can't disseminate between FACT and OPINION within the confines of a 2 hour documentary... He's got a reader that goes along with the movie, not to mention his website has a rundown explanation, description and backing articles to his claims. The facts are the truth, the same way 'Bowling For Columbine' was.\n\nIf you see any ""glaring lies"" in this movie, let me know. Check out the facts for yourself.\n\nMicheal Moore has always been a master of persuasive arguement. Fahrenhiet 9/11 pushed his talent to a whole new level.

548;741.0;1.0;15.0;Greetings,\n(...) For all the death, destruction, and anger in the world today, it's easy to get caught up in a propaganda film like Fahrenheit 9/11 and place blame on the current president.\n\nMoore's anti-Bush / anti-American film is flawed in many aspects. I recommend watching the other propaganda film FahrenHYPE 9/11. In this film, they interview the soldiers and families that were used in Moore's movie. It is interesting to hear them talk about how most of the footage was used without authorization and edited to fit Moore's anti-message. Needless to say that they were angry that their words were edited into something that was never intended to be heard the way it was portrayed.\n\nAnyway, watch both films, and if you are at all intelligent, make your own mind up, don't rely on the Moore's of America to give creditable information. There is a lot out there that is easy to review. As bad is Bush is to some, look into Kerrys past and tell me he is a sure thing for a better replacement. I find it sad that we have these two to choose from. :(;Fahrenheit 9/11 vs FahrenHYPE 9/11
549;742.0;5.0;15.0;When Moore doesn't grandstand and lets his subjects speak directly, the result is deeply moving.  This film was by far the most nuanced, compelling, and evocative documentary made by Moore, whose work I've followed since the late 1980s.  When Robert Frost wrote about having a lovers' quarrel with his country, he was describing the kind of patriotism demonstrated in this film:  Moore wants America to be the best version of itself it can be.;Very moving
615;743.0;3.0;15.0;"Jeeze ... this film has become such a lightening-rod, I'd like to be as careful as I can in my review to leave my own political opinions out of it.\n\nThere were certain things I wanted to see when I sat down to watch the film.  I've always felt that in a documentary, structure and integrity are absolutely critical to the success of the piece.  That may sound fairly obvious, but Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' took a LOT of liberties with a TON of the facts it was using to build it's argument as well as jumping all over the place, subject wise (Tim McVey/NRA/Lockheed Martin/the media/K-Mart ... dammit Mike ... pick one and stick with it).  I wanted to see it demonstrated that Moore was past that and trusted his facts enough to present his argument.\n\nSo how did he do?  Well ... it's better then 'Columbine.' I still think Moore hit his high-water mark with 'Roger and Me,' but it IS better then the irresponsible 'Columbine.' For the most part, it passed the smell test.  On Moore's web-site he made sure to present the sources he used for his information so the audience could see where he was drawing his conclusions from.\n\nGranted, several facts have since been de-bunked by the 9-11 commission, but GENERALLY speaking he's much more accurate here then 'Columbine' was in its best moment.  The habit that Moore seems to have developed that drives me crazy though, is that he's too prone to (not always, but sometimes) build a particular argument on HIS INTERPRETATION OF facts, instead of the facts themselves.  This occasionally leads Moore to start getting really carried away with a few of his conspiracy theories (... a pipeline though the middle-east?).\n\nThe thing that Moore really has a knack for, is capturing the ridiculous side of human nature and being able to make people laugh at themselves during the worst of times.  I'm thinking of the segments with the ""office parachute"" or the sealed ""anti-terrorist pot-a-john.""  There's not enough though, I would have loved it if there was a little more of this kind of humor.\n\nMoore still jumps subjects a little too much.  I'd love for him to just sit down and make a film on JUST the 2000 election or JUST FOX New's right-wing bias or JUST the way fear is used in today's society.  As it is in Fahrenheit, Moore tries to cover every subject and as a result, some interesting work winds up feeling half-finished.\n\nAs a whole, if you take this as an Op/Ed piece, it instantly becomes a lot better.  For Bush supporters, you have to realize that this piece is NOT the least bit ""fair or balanced"" as Fox News would say.  For the Left, you also need to remember that Moore HAS an agenda and he's been proven in the past to be a little loose with the truth to make his point.  Just because it's such an open-handed slap at Bush, doesn't mean that it's good.  Don't be afraid to challenge Moore and to research his facts on you own.  What you may learn will only strengthen your own convictions.\n\nThere in lies the value in a piece such as this.  It will incite people who may not normally follow the political process to get involved and educate themselves.  The challenge for either side is to not just take it at face-value.";Take it for what it is ...
633;744.0;5.0;15.0;The only lies in this film are coming out of the mouths of the Bush Administration. How I wish that Michael Moore had not had to make this movie...but bless him for doing so.  Watch the movie. Then vote your conscience.;The truth hurts....
655;745.0;5.0;15.0;Usually I go to see movies for their entertainment value, and occasionally I will also see something that's genuinely inspiring or even moving, but often just to be able to laugh, admire great art and acting and a good engaging story are enough for me.\n\nThis movie is something completely different, as it's not trying just to entertain (though it does) or just be artful (though it is), but to tell the truth to the American people that they have been blinded from by the people in power who work solely for their own greed and ulterior motives, without any consideration to the American public they're supposed to serve, or to the world at large.  We're at one of the biggest crossroads not just in American politics, but in human history, and Moore presents that argument very clearly and understandably about how we've been duped and what we must do come November 2nd.  The stakes are higher than they've ever been, and Mr. Moore shows us that abudnantly.\n\nWhy the most important movie ever made?  Simply because if this movie helps accomplish it's goal of getting Bush ousted from the White House, it will be a victory not just for America, but for the whole world, and Mr. Moore is to be applauded for his willingness to speak out and for his great courage under fire.  I don't think it would even be out of the question for him to win a Nobel Peace Prize for the brave work he's doing to help turn our country and planet around.  People around the world detest what this President is doing, and they pray like many of us Americans that we will see the light and vote appropriately before it's too late and we get four more years of this madman running the country.  Worst case scenario, that Bush again gets to set about destroying the world for four more years, at least Mr. Moore will have opened the eyes of millions and millions of people worldwide, and the seeds of peace and truth will have been planted to come to fruition at a slightly later time.  In addition to wholeheartedly recommending this movie, I also highly suggest paying regular visits to michaelmoore.com (especially the MUST READ section) to get more truth coming out every day that the media, influenced too much by the right wing agenda likes to keep hidden.  Bravo Mr. Moore - you have our full support, appreciation and love for all you've done and continue to do.;The most important movie ever made
702;746.0;5.0;15.0;Mike you know you are a special man to tell the truth to the American Public after all these years of StupedMen Lying to the public. It is well appreciated.;Fanstastic Genius Man of Truth
724;747.0;1.0;15.0;I was not overly impressed by the movie. Most of the 'facts' were distorted or reported out of context, but I fully expected that.\n\nWhat annoyed me the most, however, was the 'demonizing' camera tricks used.  Nearly every clip with Bush or any administration figure was edited so the persons eyes looked almost totally black.  I wasn't expecting this and it really detracted heavily from the movie.;The demon-eye camera effects have to go
738;748.0;1.0;15.0;"First, I loved Roger and Me and its sequel.  Second, I think Michael Moore's politics has clouded his art.  With that said I think he has taken untold and incalculable risks in making this film for which he deserves a certain amount of credit.  However, if he wanted to further polarize an already divided electorate he has done just that.\n\nThe film plays fast and loose with the facts (Bin Ladens NOT being vetted by the FBI, being flown out of the country during the no fly days just after 9/11, lack of intelligence regarding Sadaam's WMD's, Florida voting intimidation, Mischaracterizing recounts in Florida of 2000...ad infinitum...ALL UNTRUE).  Michael Moore does not let the facts get in the way of a good story.  It is fiction from start to finish.  That doesn't mean it still wouldn't have been entertaining...it still could have been.\n\nHowever, if there is one seminal piece of footage that sums up this film it is the 9/11 event itself.  This film goes in to absolute ""Al"" gore (pun intended) detail showing us the carnage of Iraqi civilian casualties and American GI injuries.  However, when it came to showing 9/11 footage the screen goes entirely blank with just some sound effects of plane crashing into the tower and the screams of some onlookers.  Moore's stated reason for this is clear...audience attention.  However, his unstated motivation is equally clear...the visual images of the 9/11 attacks, victims and carnage would not convey the message he needed.  In fact, it might invoke sympathy for those prosecuting the war on terror.  This was the most intellectually dishonest move in filmmaking, fact or fiction, history.\n\nBy now I'm sure you understand I'm no Michael Moore fan.  However, I like art.  After viewing this film...I'd just wish I'd seen some.\n\n(...)";Know your facts then see this film!
739;749.0;4.0;15.0;I can honestly say, that just by seeing the film from start to finish, I can say that Michael Moore must have shown a lot of guts when it came to making this film.  It is easy to understand why many people would simply hate this film (they would call it lies, deceit, B.S., etc.).  But to those who hate this film without even seeing it, that is where I would have to draw a line.\n\nI did not like the film totally (I felt that there were too many cheap shots at Bush and company), but I do give him points for how he presents his information (if he says that he has people who check the facts he presents, then anything from those facts COULD be true).  This film does show that this is America, where we have a right to express our opinions, in the hopes that those opinions would never be suppressed by anyone.  Like I said, I don't agree with everything that Michael Moore says, but it is a good film.  Whether it's disputed truth or disputed propaganda, that decision is up to you.;It's a good film...not GREAT, but just good
766;750.0;1.0;15.0;"Moore starts with doom-and-gloom predictions about what a continued G.W. Bush presidency will mean to the U.S.; by definition this is propaganda. For people looking for a justification for antiwar/anti-American activism, this is a fair attempt, but don't try to verify the ""facts"" presented -- it is not possible in a real world. They must be verified using other fiction works.\n\nFrom the flight from the country during nonflight time to altered statements and forged documents, Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' -type effort seems to have no more reality in its perspective.\n\nIf you want a fun party movie, this may be one in a stack. If you want a documentary (Moore himself admitted that this was entered as a ""documentary"" at Cannes only because that was one classification in which an opening still existed), try something like Grasping for the Wind or something educational rather than a far- far- far-left panic piece.\n\nWe all look for justification for our nuroses, but this is probably the wrong one for most.";Fiction, but Fun
777;751.0;5.0;15.0;Some of the stuff in this film is a little over hyped, but it is an excelent documentry!!!! All the people who rate this one star is obviously a total Bush supporter who does not have an open mind. Bush uses Joseph Goebells (Hitler era) type of propaghanda so why can't anyone else?  This isn't propaghanda though its the truth. So if you don't have an open mind  don't watch it, because its your loss for not being open to peoples opinions.;Its mostly all truth!!!
785;752.0;5.0;15.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 is by far the most telling documentary in recent years. The right-wing spin is exposed! It is clear that Bush is a moron and Moore clearly depicts that. There is no question that Bush is using Americans for his own right-wing agenda. Anybody who votes for Bush is a moron and has no clear sense of what is right and what is wrong...;A must watch for every American...
790;753.0;5.0;15.0;Obviously Michael is opinionated and he raises a lot of questions. A lot of people trash this movie as being a tool of the left wing. But I have yet to hear any rebuttals to his facts as they are presented, just bashing. But any open minded, clear thinking AMERICAN will walk away from this movie thinking. YOu will laugh you will be moved but you also wonder. An excellent documentary!;thank god for freedom of speech
800;754.0;5.0;15.0;"Michael Moore has a specific viewpoint and a clear agenda.  There is no question that his movie is intended to provoke a response rather than merely provide a bland analysis of the Bush presidency.  It is fascinating to see footage of the president and his advisors that has never been aired elsewhere and is not a pre-arranged photo-op or soundbite.  Also, the image of Vice President Gore carrying out his duties in the Senate by dismissing the challenges to the 2000 election results is stunning.  That's right.... Gore is pounding the gavel to silence those who were trying to file official protests on his behalf.  Regardless of your opinion on that election, these scenes are highly entertaining.\n\nIn my opinion, Moore's movie is most effective when presenting the American citizens who have been investigated by the government under the guise of ""national security"".  The idea that someone would be visited by the FBI after criticising the president while working out at a health club scares me greatly.  I love this country and it sickens me to see such un-American police powers.  I now understand why one of the most conservative members of Congress in the last 10 years, Bob Barr of Georgia, has signed on as a consultant to the ACLU to fight the USA Patriot Act.\n\nIn Moore's previous films, he shaped the issues by adding his own voice at every turn.  With this film, he has greatly reduced this tendency.  Comparatively speaking, he is rather tame in his own personal commentary, particularly after the Bush- Saudi segment.  He also limits his use of ""ambush journalism"" that is a staple of his earlier works.  I can only recall one instance of him trying to goad someone he was attempting to interview and even that segment was less confrontational than his usual style.\n\nI highly recommend this film.";Informative most of the time, entertaining throughout
816;755.0;5.0;15.0;My wife cried for most of the movie.  If anyone doubts the facts, read House of Bush, House of Saud.  Moore worked closely with Unger.  For the people that think moore is angry in this doc., I agree with you.  however, i think his movies/books are made out of anger.  This is an amazing movie that shows people what is not normally seen of war/business/politics.

821;756.0;2.0;15.0;I did not vote for George W. Bush in 2000 and I do not intend to vote for him in 2004. I am not fond of Kerry either and I wish we had a third alternative. I went into this movie with negative opinions about the Bush administration and assumed that I would find a kindred spirit with this film. However, aside from being an endurance test for the rational thinker, this film is biased and stilted to the extreme that it verges on yellow journalism and scaremongering. One gross example is from a news archive when Bush was informed of the second plane hitting the Twin Towers. The film clip has a voice-over with Mr. Moore's wild speculation as to what President Bush was thinking at that moment.\n\n This is neither journalism nor a documentary. This is rapid speculation and conjecture and disallows for the viewer to develop their own opinion. Yes, the connections between favoured businesses, businessmen and world leaders is daunting and frightening, but presented in a format that is prejudiced and only presents details that support Mr. Moore's opinion. A documentary should recount history fairly and honestly, rather than supplant an accurate recording with supposition.\n\n  As a film, it was poorly shot, tedious and waxed with Mr. Moore's personal opinion of self-importance. In journalism, and this is rated as a documentary, the presenter should never become the story and should never eclipse the story. Mr. Moore has done both and butted heads with the Canons of Journalistic Ethics. I am amused... and worried...that anyone watching this film could take it seriously. The issues proposed in the film are relevant and important BUT represent the views, opinions and scare tactics of Mr. Moore who is visibly heel-bent on the downfall of this administration.\n\n Be afraid...be VERY afraid when so few people have so much power as to produce a film that has such a far reaching audience and there is no equal voice for opposition. This is a propaganda film disguised as a documentary and should not be viewed as an historical account.;Be Afraid ... Be VERY Afraid

In today's political discourse, the louder, more abusive person seems to win the debate.  It's time for facts and footage to win the hearts and minds of the people.\n\nMoore steps back and presents footage to back up his facts.  This movie is different from his others in that Michael is not on the camera much.  The subject of the picture is the victim, be it mothers, soldiers, Iraqis, or American people. How can anyone call Moore a liar when footage shows words coming out of Bush's mouth?  The Bush cabal has snuggled up to the Saudis.  There is footage of them together in this film.

While his film is a fine one in terms of entertainment, one would be hard-pressed to defend its absolute accuracy. It is unquestionable that Moore portrays only one point of view in his movie and it is undeniable that at points, the integrity of the facts he presents is lacking.\n\nMichael Moore is looking for a best picture Oscar this year. That is altogether fitting because this is not so much a documentary. It's more or less a movie like any other. And, as it is a movie, the audience should be advised that there are ulterior motives. The movie is aimed to serve both the economic and political goals of its director. Its viewers, if they are intelligent, should understand this.\n\nThe American people, as individuals, are possessed of a valuable quality called free will. This quality is what allows them to choose whether or not they want to spend their time and money in watching a movie. It is also the one that will allow them to judge for themselves the veracity of Moore's film.\n\nMost of movies are composed of bits of fiction and bits of what is true. Moore's film is no different. Quite frankly, one would be foolish to look at the work in question and accept it as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...because it's not. One would also be foolish to reject the entertainment value of the film wholesale because one disagrees with the slant, fiction, and fallacies that Moore used in making his point.\n\nFree speech is often the most recognized of our Constitutional rights, but in some cases, it may become the least admired.

Our troops have defended that right for centuries and I would think it sad to undermine it at this late date.\n\nTherefore, I affirm the entertainment value of this film and choose to disagree with the ideas expressed by it.

I would have liked the picture to be made in a more gentle manner . . . anyone who would be seeing a less overt movie would still be able to figure out its intent.

Unfortunately, it rapidly becomes clear that the sole purpose of 'Farenheit 9/11' is to get Bush, as often and as recklessly as possible. If Bush is involved, Moore spins and twists the facts in any manner possible to cast Bush in a negative light. During the 9/11 attacks, Moore casts Bush as a stunned doofus, unable to apparently comprehend or react to the monstrous nature of those terrorist attacks. Yet of course Moore's own infamous reaction shortly thereafter (""Many Families have been devastated tonight. This is just not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him! Boston, New York, DC and the planes' destination of California - these where places that voted AGAINST Bush!"") is hardly a paragon of logical, rational thought (translation: ""Dear Osama: Next time, please kill Republicans."")\n\n Yet at the same time, according to Moore, Bush is at the heart of and one of the chief beneficiaries of some nebulous, James Bond S.P.E.C.T.R.E.-like conspiracy with Saudi Arabia and the military-industrial complex. Well, which is it? Is Bush a doofus, or a mastermind? Apparently it's whichever at which particular moment Moore thinks makes Bush look the worst.\n\n The real problem with Farenheit 9/11 is that it is so flagrantly, unabashedly biased that it instantly polarizes its viewers and renders any intellectual debate nearly impossible. You either spend the entire time pumping your fist in agreed outrage at the screen, or sit nauseous in your seat hoping Moore will finally just move to France and be done with it. And unfortunately, as a moderate Democrat, Farenheit 9/11 is so extreme that I find myself in the latter half this time.";Means to an end

It does an excellent job of summing up the Anti-Bush platform and provides a great deal of information related to possible failures at the highest levels of our government.\nMichael Moore is not anti-American and he does not portray our soldiers badly.  Rather, he portrays them as good kids who are currently being led to their deaths for no reason.  He questions our leadership and our government and there is nothing more American than that.

1421;790.0;1.0;15.0;"(Note: six hundred words cut from original review for Amazon's length guidelines.)\nFahrenheit 9/11 (Michael Moore, 2004)\nSomehow, I had convinced myself, thanks to early reviews and trailers, that Moore's film was, despite its title, about George W. Bush and his antics. I could handle that. I think Bush is a total moron. But what was marketed to me and what I got were two entirely different things.\nMoore spends (as I should have figured) the first twenty minutes of the movie preaching the same pablum that got him booed offstage at last year's Oscars about Bush ""stealing the presidency."" (One is tempted to think he's probably be saying the same thing if Gore had won by a hair, since we'd be just as bad off, if not worse.)  He then goes on to show us how many people tried to lodge complaints against the (completely legal) judicial decision to install Bush, but how none of them managed to get a single Senator to sign the complaint (which is necessary for the complaint to be registered). Here is Moore's first piece of duplicitous spin (and we haven't even gotten to the opening credits!): he makes it look as if all the complainers were African-American. Hmmm. Those watching C-Span at the time will have a slightly different memory. And his implication here is, of course that the Senate, as a whole, is racist. (This becomes important towards the end of the film, and is one of the few places where Moore pays any attention at all to the actual art of filmmaking.) There couldn't be any other explanation (like, for example, the whole process was perfectly legal and executed according to both the letter and spirit of the Constitution, and none of the Senators would sign for THAT reason. What a silly idea!)\nHang on to your hat, folks, because it gets worse. I won't go into that much detail (because, after all, I only have a thousand words), but the movie bounces back and forth between this same kind of duplicitous spin and outright lies (my favorite: Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi military ""had never attacked or killed an American"" prior to March, 2003. There are probably some families of Desert Storm veterans who have grounds to sue based on that single line).\nThat theme prevails throughout. Moore presents a number of facts, connects them all, and then presents his interpretation as the only one possible. Problem is, in every case, he's wrong. There are multitudes of possible explanations for everything he says.\nHe runs out of ways to milk ""Bush stole the presidency"" and the single most overrated event in human history (9/11) about halfway through, so the movie starts looking like a particularly unfunny episode of Cops. Moore tries to present his Iraq footage in a sort of Errol Morris kind of way, but even then, Moore can't keep his fingers out of the pie. Here; he bounces between the usual duplicitous spin and outright lies, but also adds statistically insignificant sob stories in order to back up his assertions. Anyone who's taken a stats 101 course should be able to see through this ploy, but the audience who was with me seems to have been even more math-challenged than I am, because no one seemed to see the naked, amateurish emotional manipulation Moore was attempting.\nBut all of this is about the politics of the movie, and that's not what I'm about. Usually, I could care less about the politics. And had there been anything filmically to redeem this piece of pure garbage, I'd rush to point it out. But this is journeyman's work in its best moments, rank amateurism at worst. My guess is that Moore has the same mindset as a number of poets I used to know back before I got out of the ""slam"" scene: ""technical details don't matter as long as I get my message across."" Which makes the work, by definition, not poetry, but political screed. It's a harder point to argue with film (because film, pretty much by definition, just kind of sits there on celluloid without anything to oppose it, as poetry has prose), but if I could find a way, I'd do it. This film isn't about medium at all, and by the very nature of art that makes it weaker than it could have been. Even if you kept all the duplicitousness, lies, and silliness intact, some real attention to the process of filmmaking could have made this an incredibly powerful piece of work. But Moore is concerned with the message, not the medium, without understanding how attention to the latter will inspire greater understanding of the former. Lots of crap documentaries get made that are well worth watching because the images on the screen, and the interviewed themselves, are allowed to tell the story (Mule-Skinner Blues is a perfect example), but Moore isn't satisfied with that. He's got to wave his message in our faces, making sure we get a good noseful of the stink, because he doesn't trust the American public to come to HIS conclusions about all this unless he tells us what those conclusions are. Folks, he thinks you're stupid, pure and simple.\nI realize this review is completely useless. Those few people who have the ability to think critically will see this for the pile of steaming vomit it is. Those brainless morons who consider themselves ""conservatives"" while playing in their own religious filth will attack it without ever having seen it. Those other brainless morons who are willing to swallow everything told them without questioning it are going to go to this movie, swallow it whole as the gospel truth, and go around spreading the disease among those others too poor, too young, or too apathetic to get to the theater.

It's just that good.\nMichael Moore's fourth full-length documentary feature starts with the 2000 Presidential election debacle, but quickly accelerates to September 11, 2001, where the attacks are handled with surprising sensitivity and grace.  The majority of the film, however, deals with the Bush/Saudi/bin Laden connections that may have complicated America's response to 9/11, the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the backroom business deals that may have provoked both campaigns.\nFAHRENHEIT 9/11 does pull a couple of punches - Moore does not discuss Honduras' pullout from the ""Coalition of the Willing"" because of John Negroponte's appointment as Iraq's US ambassador, and he doesn't target the apparent complicity of American media as much as some may have wanted.  Other than that, Moore hits the target with surprising and devastating force (and some well-placed humor) every time.\nThis is a sobering indictment of the George W.

He blames Bush for September 11, and he thinks we were sent to Iraq for the wrong reason. Don't be fooled by what this overstuffed hot air balloon says. The 9/11 comission report contradicts everything Michael Moore says in this film about September 11. In the issue on Iraq, Moore goes on to claim that Saddam Hussein was a perfectly innocent man, yet he never tells of his record of genocide and torture, even though Moore knows he used chemical weapons (a WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION) to kill 100,000 Kurds. Saddam also launched 50 SCUD missiles against Israel during the Gulf War, which were chemical warheads and he was also believed to be behind the plot to assasinate George H.W Bush in Kuwait in 1993. Remember when Saddam said he apologized for invading Kuwait, and then he started firing SCUD missiles at Kuwait during the recent Iraq war? Get real here! Quit listening to this guy. Moore has defintelely given in to the liberal socialist agenda. He will not admit that socialism is a failure. Moore wants Bush out of office because he wants to make America a socialist country.

160;795.0;5.0;14.0;"I just watched ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", last night.  This is the film that has had citizens of the United States, France and other nations debating, discussing and deliberating.  While some see it as a true example of freedom of speech, and following the old addage that ""the truth shall set you free,"" others see it as a perpetuation of subversion, disrespect and even anti-patriotism, at the hands of the filmmaker and writer, Michael Moore.\n\nThis is the first of Moore's documentaries that I have seen, and I hope to see more.  His unique blend of ironic narration, juxtaposed with presidential footage, a supercharged soundtrack (interlaced with a combination of rock & roll and standards), and chilling figures and documents, backing up his belief that the whole ""War on Terror"" was one of the hugest,deadliest, coldest and most expensive tricks pulled on the American people, to date.  According to Moore, not only was the 9/11 tragedy a set-up, from the get-go, but due to the political and professional ties the Bush family had with the Bin Laden family, our soldiers were sent to start a war with a group of innocent people, in a country that had nothing to do with the terrorism, or the deaths of thousands of innocent casualties in the Twin Towers, that fateful day of September 11, 2001.\n\nThis film is enough to make anyone opposed to this war very, very angry at our government, the grand manipulators who played with our heads (through media coverage, as an example), and even at ourselves for falling for this cruel joke, devised by politicians who only bow to the almighty dollar.  Moore captures the tone of this anger very effectively, yet, I didn't find it one-sided, subversive or even particularly radical.  I just felt I was being presented with the facts that were coveted for so long, and that I was finally given a glimpse into a reality (more like ""surreality"") that many of us may have suspected, but few of us were able to prove.  I felt that Moore's interviews with people in support of the war were not manipulations.  He listened respectfully to Lila Lipscomb, mother of one of the soldiers, with respect and also with tolerance.  What's more, he doesn't let us forget that the young people fighting on the frontlines are just as human, real and have just as much dignity as those who are vehemently opposed to the bloodshed and heartlessness of violence.\n\nMasterfully done, Michael.  This is definitely one of those films that will stand the test of time.  It is truly a time capsule that transcends the generations.  I am sure people will talk about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" for many, many years to come.";brilliant and chilling.......

Words fail me at the disgust I feel for this man and hence the title of my review.  He is not an American, I don't know what he or it is.  I cannot begin to list the outright prevarications in the film.;The Man without a country

82;802.0;1.0;13.0;Make that NO stars!\n\nMoore and this movie are too ridiculous to take seriously. But notice the adoring responce of the Democrats--embracing this slob and plopping him next to the equally vile Jimmy Carter at their convention--compared to the hissy fit they're throwing on behalf of the sociopath, Boy Clinton, over ABC's docu-drama, Path to 9-11. Stunning hypocrisy!\n\nIf they'd devoted as much energy to getting bin Laden and protecting this country from Islamo fascist terrorism when they had the chance (and were entrusted with the nation's security!), 9-11 may have been prevented, and we'd all be in a much stronger position today.\n\nThe Stalinist left--Lotion Boys for the Jihadists--demonstrates its disdain and hatred of American at every turn.;Notice the Hypocrisy!

Watch this film and then do some checking on your own.;Why is America so apathetic?
270;805.0;5.0;14.0;Whether you like this movie or not, I give it 5 stars because it shows the Public what is going on. And for the people that say, don't believe what you see on this movie, well, Michael Moore doesn't use special effects. The footage of Bush IS actual footage. This may be propaganda but it is also and eye opener for the public, as to say that not everything is hunky-dory behind the scenes. There are things that are happening that you don't know about, and Michael Moore at least tries to make people see that. You don't have to agree with it, but there does need to be more awarness of what is actually happening with everyone on this planet. You may think that it doesn't affect you, but when Billions of dollars(your money) are going towards things that you might not even know about, then there is a problem. This film tries to show that, and I think it also tries to get people to speak up and say, that is not right, we need to do something.;It's About Time Someone Stepped Up...

389;810.0;1.0;14.0;I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight and I was shocked. I was told by numerous people that, all politics aside, it was a good movie.  Even if this movie were billed as a fictional account (it is billed as a documentary) of Michael Moore's vision of President Bush, it was a poorly made film.  It is a film that tries to argue a point of view but yet doesn't quite know how.  It makes random points without establishing any connection from one point to another.  Not only was this poor film making, the filmmaker flat out lied to it's viewers.  Is America this gullible?  I have a hard time believing that Americans could buy into this garbage.  Not only are the filmmaker's arguments random and pointless but they are made up, misconstrued, and false.  I strongly urge anyone who has seen this film to watch another film title FarenHYPE9/11.  Michael Moore is a liar.  From the beginning of the film to the end, he lies.  I have never voted for a republican president in my life, but after viewing this propaganda garbage, this November may be my first vote for a republican.  SEE FarenHYPE9/11.  Note: It may be hard to find in video stores because there are very few copies and those that exist, are usually rented.;Poor Filmaking
392;811.0;1.0;14.0;I'm giving this movie 1 star because Michael Moore presents this movie as fact. This it is not, Moore takes footage without the concent of the person hes interviewing on several occasions, and takes the footage out of context. A number of other things in the movie just aren't true, and have been disproven by the 9/11 commission. Watch it if you want but do not take it all for fact, do your own research to form opinions on this country and administration. Dont take an extremists opinion;A propaganda film for the ages
394;812.0;5.0;14.0;This is the first question viewers ask about a documentary. Guess what, all documentarians push their beliefs of the subject matter in their films. That's why they make them. I didn't give this film 5 stars because I believe every word said. I gave it 5 stars because it opened my eyes. I have never been interested in politics. I didn't follow the progress of this war. Therefore I didn't vote in the 2004 election. After watching this film I hate myself for that. I feel in some way responsible for whatever else happens in this war because of my stupidity in turning my back. Excellent films do more than entertain. They force you to think and feel emotion. This film did that and more for me. I thank you Michael Moore.;Truth or Not?
395;813.0;5.0;14.0;The first time I saw this movie, I wept.  The second time I saw it, I laughed and then got angry.  A couple more times, and I became motivated to change our great country.  Sure, there may be more substantive leftie documentaries out there, but Moore's effort stands out as a great piece of art.  This deserves all the accolades it gets (as well as all the conservative jeers, because it skewers their beloved leaders so aptly).  Buy it.;Moving

435;815.0;5.0;14.0;Michael Moore is a great American and a good Democrat. He really opened my eyes to how disturbing the war on Iraq is. I like the way it starts out cause it brings back memories of the 2000 election. I really think the threat to America was overlooked before it happened and the first several months George W. Bush was kind of a slacker president. He read My Pet Goat for 7 mintues before telling the class what happened on September 11. The war in Afghanistan ended up not being as big as the war in Iraq which to me is pretty strange because for me the reason the trade center was attacked was because of Osama Bin Laden and his cronies sending their warped believers off on a plane. Footage of the war and certain people's sick attitude about it were very disturbing. Its emotionally moving and will make you cry at times. Bush may have been reelected but I do not believe he is one of our better presidents that we have had. Next election vote Democratic.;A very emotional film. One of my favorite movies.
447;816.0;5.0;14.0;The re-election of Bush proves that there's an ignorant side to America. But, I suppose if I voice my opinion and state something negative about my country that makes me a bad guy. Sounds more like Communism than Democracy. Michael Moore is voicing his opinion, backed with facts, on his country. A country that he's proud of and wants to make better. I congratulate him on his work and release of Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\nNow for the 1 star reviews from republican conservatives who most likely haven't seen the movie........ It's a shame how most republicans follow and support other republicans when you should be supporting and following principles. Think about that.;The ignorant side of America

502;818.0;2.0;14.0;While the argument that this film's only aim is to achieve controversy is pursuasive, it is by no means conclusive.\n\nYes, it has necrophilia, incest, prostitution and intense violence, but to talk only about these things reduces the film to a petty little gratuitous teenage-angst rant. Or, as one reviewer has claimed, this is shock value without purpose, place, or reason is somewhat naive.\n\nThe film is a work of genius. Fantastic, visionary, apocalyptic.\n\nMicheal Moore displays the carnivalesque workings of the body to the full. Where others have chosen to shy away, Moore explores every crevice of the grotesque, literally dissecting it to its corporeal elements to discover just exactly where are heads are at. The dead body is central to the film. Typical outdated stereotypes of the human mind, and indeed of America, are discarded along with the decaying flesh. Namely, preoccupations with politeness, taste, manners, and rational, institutional values are laughed at and abused. These things, along with sexual life, eating, drinking, and defecation have radically changed their meaning.\n\nThe film is made in a time where America and its people are questioning and trying to define themselves. The warm closed insular security of the American economic womb has been violently ruptured. Jobs and moral values are no longer stable in modern-day America. Just exactly does it mean to be American? A number of middle-eastern influences confuse the cultural collage that the USA in a time where not many things are stable. Boundaries that did exist are no longer there. Being polite, reserved and rational with a nice institution to support you is no longer America.\n\nAnd this is where Moore comes in. Moore explores boundaries and then seeks to subvert them. Sexual boundaries do not exist. One is free to have sex with one's daughter or drink the breast-milk from your wife because there is no where to stop when there are no borders. By pushing the boundaries and bringing them to the fore, Moore questions what exactly makes us tick. Where are we when there is no one to define us? We may have the trappings of civilized beings, but we are after all bestial.\n\nThe home video camera work gives the film a haunting sense of reality and naturalness to what was previously considered to be unnatural. The dark sense of humour permeating through this real texture transcends this film from generic classification. It is a grotesque operatic romp mocking the polite film establishment, politics and society and repressive stereo types.\n\nIt questions why we find such interest in watching these things, and most disturbingly, what should we feel when we watch them.;Fahrenheit 9/11: The Future of Cinema
511;819.0;1.0;14.0;I am not a political person, but I do enjoy the occasional commentary on things when truthful.  This film is an obvious piece of propaganda with no distinguishing values at all.

It would be nice if people just threw away their biases and affiliations and just for once, opened up their minds.  In an age of unprecendent media viewership and domination of the world, it's hard to tell what to accept and what not to accept.  However, one always knows whether something is right or wrong.  A live clip of an explosive attack against a post of American troops, mutilated corpses, dead babies...those are nothing that special effects could ever touch. These things could never be staged.\n\nI don't care what your beliefs are, but if you just walked away from this movie, shrugging it off with whatever premanufactured dismissals of a work of this nature and magnitude, you are beyond ignorant.  A forceful generalization, yes indeed.  If you refuse to watch this film for any other reason than it's extremely graphic and rather disturbing nature, you need to open up your eyes to the real world.\n\nMichael Moore is obviously biased, but who isn't?  I will not say that I completely agree with his beliefs, having read all of his works and watched Bowling for Columbine.  However, in Fahrentheit 9/11, Moore barely interjects his opinions like has in his previous works.  He does something that very fiew journalists, news channels, politicians, and Americans have remotely done--let the evidence do the talking.\n\nI give this movie 5 stars as a concerned individual growing up in this world.  I am not even old enough to vote, and I have no political affilations.  I am giving it 5 stars because it realistically depicts the realities of this world.  Let me place an emphasis on reality.  Fahrentheit 9/11, though clearly biased and with certain discrepancies, shows you what numbers, campaign ads, newspapers, news stations, and politicians cannot--reality.;Republican or democrat, doesn't matter.

733;825.0;4.0;14.0;"I think the most important thing about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is: Some big ol' sloppy, public school-educated guy from Michigan didn't like something; he went out and made a movie about it and got people charged up.  Love it or hate it, that is America.  Love it or hate it, he can say what he wants and you can say what you want.\n\nThe important thing, I think, is that people get motivated -- one way or the other -- by ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  Is this movie good journalism?  Good documentarianism?  Not really.  It's more of an op-ed piece and there are things here I agree with and there are things I don't agree with; it's a bit like a lecture you can't stop if you have questions.\n\nBut the important thing people should take away from it is curiousity.  If you think Moore's facts are faulty, dig in and find out for certain.  If you think he's telling the absolute truth, let that motivate you to learn more and you may find your opinion shifting a little. If you think this is a bad movie, make your own.\n\nDon't be a part of one of the mobs -- not the mob that says ""oh, it's not a documentary 'cause documentaries have to be true,"" nor the mob that accepts it just because it's funny and selects your particular target.

734;826.0;1.0;14.0;"Michael Moore is by no means an idiot. It takes a mastermind to manipulate facts the way he does. Anyone that takes the things he says to heart honestly does not know a thing about what he is saying. One interesting fact about Michael Moore is that he had a private screening of Bowling For Columbine for victims and the family members of victims. When they arrived they were expected to pay for entry to the movie that he invited them to. Michael Moore spreads his anti american sentiment all around the world and ignorant people soak it up. Michael Moore is quoted as having said that the people on the planes during 9/11 were scaredy cats and that if there had been black people on the planes they would have fought back and crushed them because they don't take disrespect from anyone. That is how warped this guys mind is. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT ANYONE THAT WATCHES HIS MOVIES READ ""Micheal Moore is a big fat stupid white man.""

743;827.0;4.0;14.0;"""All art is propaganda; not all propaganda is art."" - George Orwell\n\n...and in my opinion, Michael Moore's timely screed *Fahrenheit 9/11* is Art with a capital A, a near-masterpiece of skewed filmmaking in the fine tradition of *Triumph of the Will* and *Birth of a Nation*, though far more left-leaning than its predecessors.  Composed, with almost equal ratio, of damning evidence and below-the-belt circus antics; dripping with well-deserved contempt for the Bush administration; smothered with borderline-exploitative pathos and bookended by a shellshocked white-liberal's politik angst: *Fahrenheit 9/11* is immensely entertaining and highly relevant in our spin-era, and a must see for any self-respecting liberal (affirmation after affirmation for the leftest paradigm), neo-con (c'mon! Know thy Enemy, yaas?) and film-student alike.\n\nTo be honest, I'm highly ambivalent of Michael Moore as a ""journalist,"" or, for that matter, a social critic.  Nor am I affiliated with one of the two political juntas that currently split the U.S.A in two: to give this review a proper perspective, let's just say I'm one of those ""moderates"" despised by both camps for not kowtowing to the prevalent rhetoric of-the-moment.  And yet, the talent that composed *Fahrenheit 9/11* cannot be denied - this man knows how to push buttons.  Scruffy and slovenly, Moore's working-class faade contrasts that of his contemporaries (Huff n' Puff blowhard Bill O'Reilly, Oxycotin spokesman Limbaugh, the pathologically perverse enigma that is Ann Coulter), but the essentials of media-manipulation remain steadfast - selective information coupled with highly-skilled editing tricks; shameless pandering; carnival-barker crowd theatrics ... but while his contemporaries tend to shovel all of the tribulations of modern society on the catch-phrase explicate ""liberal"" - lowest common denominator ad hominem expressed in the most blas manner possible - Moore's focus here is centered upon the figurehead, the cowboy in control, the inexplicable but all too real joke that is the DUBYA.\n\n""Was it all a dream?"" Moore wonders at the beginning of the film, tickling a major sore-spot for his core audience with scenes from the 2000 election fiasco.  I have to admit that it's a guilty pleasure watching Moore take on Bush Co. with both barrels loaded and plenty of ammunition to spare; and although 9/11's cut n' paste technique is often misleading (yes, I've read the 56 deceits page), the material in itself is a damning enough portrait of greed, corruption, hubris, Wizard of Oz stylized fear-tactics, base stupidity...it's all here, folks, in voluptuous quantity.\n\nAnd the music cues - oh, those music cues! - Moore displays as deft a sense at the mixing board as at the editing equipment, and the result is, at times, flat-out hilarious. Bush and family cavorting at the ranch and golf course to down-home country jams - gut busting! Bush's service record underscored by a few bars of Eric Clapton's 'Cocaine' - lip-quivering!  Sinister Arabic music, reminiscent of a villain theme for a James Bond flick, to introduce a rather offensive Saudi Arabian Bush Co. connection - sheer genius! The use of sound is not just confined to the humorous, however.  The black-screen treatment of 9/11, complete with screams and destructive rumbling, is highly effective, and I was surprised Moore showed restraint and did not include footage of the dual impact or the suicide-jumpers.  The burning of Baghdad is underscored by the dirge n' strum of a soldier's favorite carnage-score: the result is jaw-dropping, a horrific example of psychological triune-stroke to motivate battle-heat; when juxtapositioned with the burnt, mutilated Iraqi corpses, it inspired in me both nausea - for the brutality of life; and admiration - for the artistic will composting the film. *Fahrenheit 9/11* continued on, relentless, thoroughly exposing Bush Co. as a plutocratic nightmare to the concept of democracy; and my outbursts of laughter at the antics became edged with a growing hysteria-tone - for this absurd theater was/is all too real, not to mention readily and rabidly defended by the meme-drenched Republican masses.\n\nMoore does fumble from time to time.  Certain segments went on too long, the African-American representative reaction being a prominent example.  The patriotic mother/slain child segment also occupied a bit too much of the running time, despite it remaining the heart of the film and its most melodramatic example of Bush Co. betrayal.  My major beef with the film, however (thus the reduction of one star) is that Moore barely scratches at the surface in regards to some of the subjects he brings up: *Fahrenheit 9/11* can easily be seen as a liberal-slander greatest hits package, with all of the accusation and little of the depth.  Still, I know Art when I see it, and Farenhight 9/11 fits the bill.  Big time.  It's status as perhaps _the_ watercooler film of the year (alongside the Catholic Guilt Catharsis of certain other independent 2004 release), when coupled with its explosive success and critical timing, is testament enough. F 9/11 is the most important film released in 2004.\n\nHighly recommended.";Immensely Entertaining, and Relevant: Propaganda at its Best
747;828.0;5.0;14.0;"Why are there so many bitter, negative reviews of this movie?  Simply because this is a powerful movie that will influence the way that you think about important contemporary issues.\n\nThis movie presents a sobering, at times shocking, look at our President's actions since 9-11.\n\nThe President's links to Saudi Arabia, and to Saudi money have been documented in other places, but it is compelling to see it on the screen.  Perhaps most interesting is the time President Bush sat reading ""My Pet Goat"" while the country was under attack.\n\nThe movie also presents some footage from our troops in Iraq.  It is good to see footage of troops that is a more honest look at their lives in Iraq then you normally see on perky, everybody's-happy news programs.\n\nThe movie closes by following the grief of a mother who has lost her son in Iraq.  If that doesn't break your heart, nothing will.\n\nThe extras on the DVD make purchasing this item well worth it, even if you saw the movie in the theater.\n\nMany people argue that this movie is bad because ""it is a documentary and it is supposed to provide an objective view of the facts"".  I am a graduate student studying research methods, and it is clear to me that no research, or documentary for that matter, can be completely objective.  No matter how hard you try, everything you write or create is influenced by you, and therefore, not completely objective.  So, think of this movie as an editorial - it uses facts to prove a point.  The point Mr. Moore would like to make is that the Bush administration has made many mistakes and inexusable judgments since 9/11, and should be voted out of office this November.";Great movie for discussion, thought, and action
768;829.0;5.0;14.0;Michael Moore owes his entire career to the 1st amendment rights he so freely exercises. Bravo! He also owes the audience he holds sway over the right to have absolute truth told, in context, accurate and undiminished or flavored to suit his personal agenda. Unfortunately after analysis, much of Mr. Moore's efforts doesn't pass, or hold up under scrutiny. In that regard, it's merely opinion--conjecture and provides every viewer the opportunity to experience highly developed, dialectical based propaganda.\n\nUnfortunately, with the seriousness and nature of the subject at hand, propaganda does not serve, but detracts from matters of great import to our society.\n\nOpinions be had, Mr. Moore certainly has one. I can only hope that the masses that view this effort do so with the blinders off and preconceptions/misconceptions aside. You'll need it! F-9/11 is very convincing, except for one fact, which is that the average citizen will never really know the how and why, or the failures (if any). Why?  Because in adherence with national control over classified matters...we don't have the need to know. Anything else is merely thought provoking conjecture -- conspiracy theory, a waste of my time.

849;833.0;5.0;14.0;Many people don't want you to see this movie, which should tell you that you must see it.\n\nMichael Moore raises all the right questions about the trumped-up reasons for the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq. After seeing it, you'll find it very difficult to vote for Bush.;The truth is out
898;834.0;1.0;14.0;"Not since the Third Reich has someone put together such propoganda. It's rather obvious it's a ""cut n paste"" job that seeks to twist the truth buy using only half of it and then only the half that fits the scheme and fullfills the ends of it's creator.\n\n Most of this is dubunked by the 9/11 Commissions Report which I strongely urge to be read by those seeking the truth. One need only open their eyes to see the truth. Unfortunately in a free society we must put up with this kind of trash.";Simply unbelievable!
909;835.0;1.0;14.0;If you're a non-partisan - or you have a serious adult view of politics - you won't like it. If you already hate Bush, you'll love it for the cartoon it is.\n\nThe simple fact is, Moore has stated that he has an agenda with this film and it oozes out of every scene. From creative edits (like the senator who's response to Moore's question was left off, to make it appear that he had no answer) or the joke speech Bush gave that Moore presents as serious, to tons of curiously missing pieces of information (like Clinton's and the Dem's ties to Halliburton and the Carlisle Group, or the fact that it was the CIA and Richard Clark that flew the Bin Ladens out of the US and not Bush), it's all here (or not here, as the case may be) for the enjoyment of the extreme Leftist, partisan democrat.\n\nOne of the most disturbing segments is Moore's portrayal of a peaceful Iraq.. before we attacked. Moore ignores the fact that, according to Human rights organizations, literally tens of thousands of Iraqi's died every single year on average at the hands of Saddam Hussein. Does Moore actually expect us to believe that we're the bad guys?\n\nThis film is a good example of everything that is wrong with politics. Moore's extremism causes some conservatives to be extremists, and soon, they're all out of touch with the regular person. This film is a fantasy world for the political partisan conspiracy theorist. If thats you, you'll enjoy it.;Michael Moore's made a nice cartoon...
911;836.0;5.0;14.0;This is a very good piece of material that is a MUST for everyone as it raises key decision-points and presents elements for a serious discussion about the way in which you are voting.;Informative
925;837.0;5.0;14.0;Look, I don't believe everything in this film, but I enjoyed it so much I saw it twice in the theaters, and I even convinced my conservative sister and mom to see it.  Did it change their vote?  No, but they're glad they went.  It's NOT propaganda, as often claimed -- it's a visual op-ed piece.  It's Moore's opinion.  And it's intriguing enough to warrent a viewing by even the most skeptical:  And, after all, you can't really criticize it with any authority if you haven't seen the film, can you?;Watch It Unless You're Afraid to be Challenged
928;838.0;3.0;14.0;Mr. Moore's movie Fahrenheit 9/11, was technically good.\nI found to be very interesting, and I believe it will go down as one of those films that could change the world or at least the views on America.\n\nWhen tackling this type of subject matter, Moore should acknowledge his role for making more inner-hate within our county and around the world. I think people should see this movie, But should also know how much propaganda went into making it.\n\nBefore and after the movie I was on the fence on who I was voting for. But after present events, new findings, the GOP convention, and not relying solely on bias broadcast news (CNN), I have decided to go with BUSH for president.;Good but bias movie: And still voting for Bush...
984;839.0;1.0;14.0;"First and foremost, I have seen this film after closely reading what many a film critic have said.  The critics were right.  Moore twists the reality of this little place I call earth, and warps it to play his version of life.  Newsflash:  Iraq was not a nice little suburb filled with kites as Moore claims.  Saddam gassed, poisoned, beat, and terrorized those who opposed him, and he also had many a person shot in the streets for defying him.\n\n  Now, Tambo claims to be a Vietnam Vet.  Well, I am a veteran too, but I am a veteran of Iraq's war.  May I ask you something Tambo?  How would you feel about Michael Moore if he took video and photos of you while you were having your arm amputated, so that he could slap it into his ""mockumentary"" and make a cool 100 million off of your misery?  And may I ask you how you would feel if he did all of this without your permission, so that when you ask him to apologize for doing so, he refuses?  Michael Moore is a real American hero?  Yeah, and I am Spiderman.  Hopefully the agony and blood of US military personnel will make Michael Moore another 100 million so that he can feed his fat face some more cheeseburgers while he portrays himself under the facade of a common man.";Response to Tambo, the supposed Vietnam Vet
1010;840.0;1.0;14.0;I can't believe americans would pay to see some american complain and make fun about his own country.

1029;842.0;1.0;14.0;Terrible movie, Michael Moore twisted the facts to his own personal views. The story is not based on the actual facts, it is based on one sided view, which does not give you a balance of opinion. It is base on one focus political view. Clever on manipulating the facts. I recommend not even to waste your time see it.;Farenheit 9/11
1032;843.0;1.0;14.0;"Even if you hate Bush, the Iraq war and any conservative ideas, this movie is still crap. I spent the my money at the theater so I could at least talk about it.

1045;844.0;1.0;14.0;I heard a joke about Michael Moore. I heard that he saw the movie/documentary 'Supersize Me' and kicked himself for not filming his last 300 trips to McDonalds.\n\nThis film is put together well and has interesting footage that is worth seeing, but the propaganda it spews is just sickening. If you're a liberal you'll love it. If you're a conservative you'll hate it. If you don't care about politics, you'll probably be bored.\n\nYou did know that the whole purpose of this film was to convince you to vote Kerry, right? And if you saw it in theatres, well, you paid upwards of eight bucks to see a prolonged mudslinging fest that up until now only viewers of television campaign ads had to put up with.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't pay twenty bucks for the DVD.;Don't Bother...
120;845.0;1.0;13.0;I used to like the guy that made this movie.  that is, until I saw this movie.  sigh, well, i hope he made a lot of money off the suffering of others.  he's lucky this is a free country, so free that he was allowed to make a movie like this and show it in theaters and sell the dvd.  I can almost see why other countries don't allow bashing of their leaders.  this was the most ridiculous, one-sided load of garbage I had ever seen in my life. if he doesn't like bush that much, he can get out of the country.  Bush is human and honest and did what he could under the circumstances. If he thinks he could've done better, he can run for president, instead of mocking others.  he makes me sick.\n\nIn response to the famous scene of bush reading to little kids after hearing that the first plane attacked, keep in mind, that at the time, we didn't know what the first plane was.  at first, the news thought it could've been an accident, and was only later thought to be possibly, and possibly paranoid to think it, a terrorist attack.  my first thought was that in speculation that the first plane, (assuming all his opinionated facts are straight), could've been a drunk pilot, the second plane was the confirmation of attack, when bush was already in the classroom.  What could've been done about that?  Shoot down all the planes in the sky?  Which ones are full of terrorists? and there are innocent citizens onboard.\n\nMoore admits to having a grudge against Bush as well. So this is really just him getting payback for Bush telling him to get a real job?  Probably.\n\nWhether Moore's facts really are true or false or manipulated to fit his own opinion, the point is that Bush did all he could afterwards and was even mocked for htat.  now, we're as naive as we were before the attack.  we're like, gawd, chill out bush, you're so paranoid. its not like it'll ever happen again or anything.  if we're like that now, even after such an unexpected attack, then imagine how carefree we were before it.  no wonder we didn't know what to do. Bush is trying hard to protect the country, to keep the same mistakes from happening again, and people make fun of him for it.\n\nMoore needs to think, rather than judge.  when he's president and does a better job, i'll bite my tongue.  till then, he's a golddigger, and if this movie really is just his message to the world, and if he's so high and mighty as to assume he can make a movie about other people's faults and mistakes, then he should donate every penny he earned to charity instead of being such a hypocrite.;pathetic
1098;846.0;4.0;14.0;Ive been taught in my life to look at all the issues. While my familly has always voted on the side of the right wing, i was always told to think for myself. I know the differences in this country are whos on the right or left, and whos loyal to which side. I am more of a realist though, when it comes to the facts. While this movie does it best in showing you how much the president is incopitent in the handling of the countries afairs, it should be taken into consideration that this particullar administation, not all republicans are to blame. Having both my father and step father serve in vietnam, both enlisted men, come back and protest against what was going on showed me at a very early age the great country in which we live. These people sacrificed their lives for the good of this country. Blindly going into war just for the sake of america. They both lost many good friends, loved ones, and still grieve to this day. Seeing what we're in war for, and why were their is a travesty. Especially when people in office are benifiting handsomely while the common americans die denfending us from something that never threatend us. It is just a case of using common sence. IF you don't agree with bush, or kerry, look at what nader has to offer. just use your heads. Ignorance is bliss. But when the facts are presented to you in clear view IT is your duty as americans TO take a stand. TO honor all of those who have protected, and those who have died trying to protect our rights. Look at the deficite, look at the unemployment, and think what your children will have to endure in order to survive. If this administation is not serving the genneral publics best interest something must be done. Common sence also has alot to do with name calling as well. Calling someone Fat because they don't hold your idea of whats right is, to say the very least, a frustated at the facts statement. wheather you like Moore or not, he has provided the facts, what ever order they are in, They are the facts. Pretend bush is neither a repeblican or democrat. and vote with your consience. Or continue the name calling and watch the country split even further. We must all work together to heal the country. If we don't try and work together what are we hear for? Every one has different opinions, but unless we actually try we will fall.;The Truth Be Told
1110;847.0;5.0;14.0;The reviews of this movie here is representative of the current dilemna in America.  The people on the right acuse everybody that do not share the same views with the label Liberal as if that is a sin.  It reminds me of the protestants line that they use againts Catholics.  The one about idols.  Everybody else is just trying to find the truth and trying to keep an open mind.\n\nI agree that this movie is an opinion by the filmmaker.  But he just presents information and the viewer makes up his own conclusions.  If the people in the video clips were paid, cajoled or forced to say or act the way they did then its propaganda.  But since no such thing occurred then its just facts.\n\nAgain if your mind is open going in or at least unbiased then and only then that you appreciate the guts and couraged it took for Michael Moore to make the movie.  Specially in a climate of perceived increase intrusion of the government in the lives of ordinary Americans.  May more people have the courage to speak up when they see that something is not right.  Fahrenheit 911 is an excellent movie.  $100,000,000.00 is box office receipts so far speaks for itself.;A Must See Movie for every American.

If you want to see something that you can talk about, debate about and just plain think about, then this is for you. It opened my eyes in a lot of ways...even though I know that it was biased.

1162;851.0;5.0;14.0;This film was absolutely amazing. Every American should see this, regardless of whether he is a Democrat or Republican. America definitely needs more film makers like Michael Moore who actually focus on real issues, unlike who's J. Lo's new husband, and do extensive research. Obviously, the film is totally Democratic, but one just has to expect that. It is a truly informative, emotional, and entertaining film.;Excellent Film

1296;853.0;2.0;14.0;"Michael Moore should get more work after this movie, or at least the offer of more, especially for editing.  He's good.  He knows , just as many actors have to do for their trade, how to invoke an emotion.  That's why we pay to go see a movie.  To get our endorphins runnin' around and get that natural high going.  So he did a good job at this, and appears to have gotten a lot of people sparked up with elated emotions.  All good movies can do that.  That's why we take the time to get online or on the phone and share our experience.\nThat's why I gave it 2 stars.  Because he did good in that area.  Because it invoked an emotion.\nHe also distorted the truth. Because, in a very large part, this movie is affecting  millions of people to a degree that they viewed this almost soley as a documentary.  I don't think a view of wounded and dead Iraqi children followed by U.S. soldiers exclaming what a rush it is to fight a war is telling a documentary.  It's invoking an emotion the filmaker wants you to have.  Fighting a war, conflict,etc. (give it whatever name you want), is not edited, it's not something you see in your daily lives unless you are THERE.  If you want to take this film and others like it (Monster is one...great movie, I had tears in my eyes, and I also researched this too and found a lot that the movie takes great freedom not to tell you(will part of this be edited out?)) as telling the truth in 2 hours, that's your right.  To push that view to others by not researching it is your right too.  For other's to believe this view is their right.  And people are going to disagree...some who have not researched it, and others who have.  I have read about a dozen of the reviews.  And with the  exception of one (partially), they viewed this with great awe and adimiration to the point of believing what this movie had to say was truth and nothing but a true documentary; this lends creedence to me that people will jump on anything to keep that invoked emotion going because they will not accept truth.\nThe truth I see, that I have researched, is:  This was an exceptionally edited, well filmed movie.\nIt's also a personal attack on George Bush by Michael Moore.\nRegarless how many people Michael says supports his same or similar views  both before and after the movie was made, this movie is pretty much that.  He hates Bush.  So much so that the truth is clouded up on what's really happening.  And what is really happening is not a movie that many people are duping themselves about; it's about getting up off your couch, out of the establishments you frequent to get the ""word"" of other people you like, and look up the truth.  It requires some time.  But I would rather have an informed opinion, which I do have here, than to declare something to be true because of emotions governing me.  That makes me human.  It makes me intelligent.  It makes me know myself.  And, emotionally,\n""I like that"".\nI ""feel"" people reading this review will get an emotion from that last line.  Try researching it.";Editors dream guy
1303;854.0;5.0;14.0;Bravo to Michael Moore for daring to speak his feelings and making his ingenius documentaries. They are films everyone should see, whether they agree with Moore or not. Here is a man unjustly hated and criticized for believing in something and trying to make others see the light. All the more power to him! I am pleasantly surprised that this film, which just a short time ago was said never to be released, has become such a hit. I admire and respect Michael Moore and cannot wait to see how he shocks America next. America should lighten up and not take everything to heart, but then again, this is the country which considers Paris Hilton a goddess. Could we expect any better? I think not.;Moore rocks!!!

It's the second hour, with Lila L. and the soldiers, that was the most riveting and moving for me.  Believe me, there wasn't a dry eye amongst the five of us women.  The emotional rollercoaster took me from laughing at the ridiculous things Dubya and his cohorts say and do, to anger at what this administration's decisions have caused, not only for Lila and her family and all the American soldiers and their families--but also for the innocent Iraqis. The theater was packed, and everyone stood and applauded when the film ended.\nI could understand why we went to war in Afghanistan--but why has Dubya quit talking about bin Laden?  Iraq was a war of Dubya's choosing, not a war to keep Americans safe.  I also urge everyone to see the documentaries ""Uncovered: The Whole Truth about the Iraq War"" and ""Unprecedented: the 2000 Presidential Election"".

1378;856.0;5.0;14.0;"After Michael Moore received a twenty minute standing ovation at the recent Cannes Film Festival and had its highest honor, the Gold Palm Award, bestowed on him, Quentin Tarantino explained to him that a significant number of Cannes' voting members were not the least bit political.  Tarantino assured Moore that the award was given on the basis of filmmaking expertise and not due to the film's political message.  Even at Fox News, a conservative cable network, the film was given a positive review on the basis of the technical expertise displayed on screen.\nFrom a purely technical standpoint the film is a masterpiece, moving briskly from emotional scene to scene, the camera's all-seeing eye recording all.  The technical virtuosity, highlighted by excellent photography, delivers to viewers a close-up of government at its nastiest ""it's all for sale"" level along with the consequences of those brazenly materialistic actions, that of sending young men and women from the least affluent areas of our society, victims of the social rip offs of the privileged top dogs, to do their fighting after destroying avenues to a better future in pursuing their greedy agenda.\nThe charge has been raised that Moore's film is not objective.  The objective of any film about any serious subject is to make a statement in the eyes of the filmmaker.  Commentators of the right reveal their viewpoint regularly.  What is unusual therefore for Michael Moore to do the same?\nThose who criticize have the opportunity to rebut the content of what appears on screen, as well as the chance to present an alternative film presenting what they consider to be a correct statement of they way things are.  As for Moore, it is impossible to rebut the touching segment of the woman from his hometown of Flint, Michigan who changed her opinion of the war after her son serving in Iraq wrote from the battle zone and sharply criticized Bush administration policies.  Not long after he wrote the letter he was dead.  This woman was not a performer.  This was real life.\nWere those statements and images from American servicemen on the scene rigged?  The emotional scenes included individuals shouting emotionally about destroying the enemy as well as those regretfully relating how big a mistake America had made in invading Iraq.  Were those scenes of destruction of civilians, including helpless children, faked?  Were those evening missions breaking into houses of innocent civilians actors playing fictional roles?\nWere those statements and images from American servicemen on the scene rigged?

Were those scenes of destruction of civilians, including helpless children, faked?

Did Bush serve in the National Guard with James Bath, who in turn set him up in business later with Osama bin Laden's chief American representative?  Are Bush's father, along with his longtime political associate and friend, James Baker, active members of the Carlyle Group?  Does the Carlyle Group, which also includes Henry Kissinger, maintain the closest possible ties, and lucrative ones at that, with the Saudi government?  Does the Saudi government behead people, one of the reasons stated why we needed to liberate Iraq?  Was the man who handed the big aid bundle with a smile to Saddam Hussein in 1983 actually who he appeared to be in the picture, none other than ""liberate Iraq from its oppressors"" Donald Rumsfeld?  Did we not hear Bush and Cheney assert 1) that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and 2) that Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were linked?  Did they furnish verifiable proof?\nGo see the film and decide for yourself about Fahrenheit 9-11 regardless of your political persuasion.  It has much to say about the current American political scene and says it in a daringly provocative way with technical expertise.";A Documentary Classic
129;857.0;5.0;13.0;Michael Moore is truly revolutionary.  I was blessed to be able to see him live and to hear his message in person.  He has a vision for our country and for our values.  He sees that we have a problem.  The problem is that we are killing and fighting for an unwinnable cause.  That kids are dying for oil and big business.  He also wants us to listen to what people are saying, Good and Bad, to be informed.  We are living in times where the president is allowing ultra-conservative men on the supreme court who are only in their early 50's.  Our president is making it so our core values of liberty and freedom and human rights are being dimminished daily.  Michael askes us to fight with peace and with the power of the ballot.

139;860.0;4.0;13.0;"I will never forget the first time I saw Michael Moore's anger-provoking film, Fahrenheit 9-11. It was June 2004, and I was sitting in a jam-packed theater in ultra-conservative Lancaster, PA. I went to see the movie with a buddy of mine, and the two of us were the only non-right wingers in the theater. We were also only two of a handful of people under the age of retirement in the theater as well. What my friend and I thought was well-placed sarcasm and humor, the right wing Republicans thought was anti-American, biased, Bush bashing. I remember laughing hysterically at certain points of the film...only to encounter the look of death from countless white, right-wing extremists who were dead-set on their blind patriotism. Upon leaving the theater, the real fun began as heated arguments escalated between spectators as they exited.\n\nRegardless of your personal politics, or your thoughts on Iraq, or your thoughts on Michael Moore, the record needs to be set straight on a few things. Does Moore promote a particular agenda in this film? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Does Moore distort certain facts and stack the cards to favor his particular point of view? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Wouldn't it be nice if those mindless sheep (Republicans) who scream bloody murder over Moore's ""factual inaccuracies"" in F-911 would get equally heated and steamed everytime Bush or Cheney or Rumsfeld spout lies to the American people about war or weapons of mass destruction?\n\nThose who oppose this movie have a particular agenda of their own...they want to stifle any and all opposition to the current militaristic, ""my country right or wrong"" philosophy that has an iron grip on this nation. To them, a free press and freedom of thought and speech is ""dangerous"" and ""unpatriotic"" and aids and abets ""terrorists.""  What a joke!\n\nNow...to the film itself. I have always liked the fact that Michael Moore dares to ask the tough questions to the people who most need to be asked them. However...Moore goes one step further and catches them on tape. Remember in Bowling for Columbine when Moore confronted Dick Clark and Charlton Heston over welfare-to-work policies and gun issues? Moore offers us another dose in F-911 when he camps out on the U.S. Capitol Building trying to encourage Congressmen to send their sons and daughters into the military to fight in Iraq. Their Congressmen's silence is deafening.\n\nMoore employs plenty of his smart-alecky, sarcastic humor in Fahrenheit 9-11 to underscore several points: Bush's secret financial relationship with the Saudis, America's historic partnerships with Iraq and Bin Laden, the Bush Administration's botched response to the 9-11 Commission, the ridiculous ""Coalition of the Willing"" nonsense, the Patriot Act's true intentions, and the invasion of Iraq as a decoy and diversion.\n\nAs with all of Moore's films, Fahrenheit 9-11 mixes drama with satire, humor with gripping seriousness. The most poignant parts of the film deal with 9-11 survivors and their relatives and also the relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq. These scenes are almost too painful to watch.\n\nF-911 has some fairly violent and distrubing images, however. One scene shows footage of a public decapitation in Saudi Arabia, and there are several other scenes that depict images of innocent civilians injured and maimed or even killed in the current Iraq war.\n\nThe only part of 9-11 that I thought should have been left out was the first 10 minutes of the film when Moore recounts the Bush presidency from Election Day 2000 up until September 10, 2001. It is clear that this was intended to smear and humiliate Bush, and served no overall meaningful purpose in critiquing Bush's policies post-911.\n\nOverall, if you are open-minded and want to explore the current situation in Iraq from a different angle than the everyday spin you get on Fox News, then this film is definitely worth checking out. The DVD is packed with plenty of nice extras, including footage on the release of F-911 and the notoriety it garnered. There is also a great extra on Arab American comedians and how they have incorporated the post-911 backlash against Arabs into their routines. Other extras include footage of Condoleeza Rice's cherade in front of the 9/11 Commission and Bush's press conference spin following his private meeting with the 9/11 Commission, along with a segment on Abu Ghraib and the handling of prisoners by Army personnel.\n\nFreedom of speech is a wonderful thing, isn't it?";The film the Bush Administration does NOT want you to see!

What I don't understand is how the h--- Bush was RE-elected after this film was made?!!? This movie gave such insight into the crookedness of politics and how Bush and his crew are profiting financially from the moves they make. Michael Moore did a great job, bottom line, he uncovered numerous facts that most of the public is unaware of and really NEEDS to be aware of. George Bush should NOT be in the position he's in, and the clips of him in the movie really show his smug, arrogant characteristics. Dont get me wrong, he's great for a laugh. (His verbal slip ups, quite amusing...and his statement when he choked on that pretzel- l giggled..) l think EVERY american should see this film. The fact that the title of the documents Bush recieved months prior to Sept 11 was ""Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S."" and yet they were STILL ignored, is unbelievable. He was too busy on his Texas ranch and playing golf to take it seriously and now look what has happened. My favorite part of the film was when Michael Moore is standing outside the building where all the congress members are coming in, and he's handing out military recruiting brochures, asking members of congress to consider getting THEIR children to enlist and go serve our country! They look at him like he's insane - it's priceless. See this movie, and convince everyone you know to see it. What have you got to lose? You're sure to come away from this movie with some astonishing information...";MUST MUST MUST SEE - DONT WAIT.
162;862.0;5.0;13.0;"This is one of the most controversial documentaries in the past few years. And, boy, is it a joy to watch! Especially for all of us liberals. Nothing that director Michael Moore presents should be new to us, but the fact that this film caused so much controversy is positive. If you are a republican you will put Mr. Moore on your ""enemies"" list, if you're a liberal you will most likely be showing this movie to all of your republican friends going ""see? see? i told you so..."".\n\nMr. Moore goes to many lengths to show how, in the end, the links between the Bush family and some ""sketchy"" groups, as in helping the Taliban regime rise to power in Afghanistan in the 1990's only to be marked as enemies a decade later when the interests changed. However, one should watch these kind of opinion pieces with an absent mind and then form an opinion, as Mr. Moore does not ask the question ""what could be the ties of the Kennedys, Clintons and other politicians to also some 'sketchy' individuals or organizations?"".\n\nNevertheless, this is a must see movie. For Republicans and Democrats. In fact, throw a party, have some Republicans and Democrats come together, and watch the movie! That should be fun and stir some waters! That's all we need! Action! Controversy! Get the people discussing issues. In the end, bring the power to ""we the people"" and don't let it sit in some closed circles, Republican or Democrat, as it only hinders Democracy!";Controversy! And why we love it!
195;863.0;5.0;13.0;"Rush Limbaugh is fond of saying that liberals hate him because he shines the light of truth on them. Apparently that explains why conservatives think Michael Moore is the worth thing that ever happened to them. After his previous film, Bowling For Columbine, right wingers were up in arms, especially because Moore himself confronted NRA spokesmen Charlton Heston in his own home and asked him why that orginization always held rallies right after a gun tragedy happened...and the rally would be in the same city as the tragedy. It was powerful stuff to watch, not because you wanted to see Heston shrink and stumble for words, but instead because certain questions need to be answered. In Farenheit 911 Moore is doing a lot of asking and a lot of conservatives are doing a lot of dodging,i.e.especially when Moore tries to get Congressmen to explain why none of their kids are in Iraq fighting the ""good fight""\n\n  Moore, as a documentary film-maker is ruthless and that's why he is effective. Nowhere else will you see footage of a perplexed George Bush sitting in a schoolhouse chair on the morning of 911, seemingly frozen after getting word that something big was shaking out there. Painful to watch, but necessary. It used to be the presses job to give us the facts but these days there seems to be a gag order on members of the media, especially when it concerns this administration and the war in Iraq. You don't want your wife outed for being in the CIA, do you?\n\n  Moore made no secret of the fact that he was trying to influence the outcome of the  2004 presidential election by putting this film out when he did...and it almost worked. But in the end Carl Rove and the other masterminds who work for Bush managed to prevail through smear and slander. They managed to trash Moore and his film and sent the swift-boat vets to take care of John Kerry. Republicans everywhere condemned Moores'film as a pack of lies but they had no real way of explaining away the facts presented in it. Limbaugh condemned the film but admitted to his listeners that he's never seen it himself...instead he took the advise of people who told him it was a ""cut & paste job"". Strange coming from a guy who often complains that people critisize his show without ever having heard it. But let's get back to Moore...\n\n  ""911"" is a must for people who want to try and make sense of what happened in Washington and around the country after...and in some cases before...September 11, 2001. It becomes apparent that the Bush administration was not focused on the terrorist threat before that tragic day and after it was history they tried to take advantage of it in the form of convincing Americans that the country of Iraq and it's leader, Saddam Hussein, were an ""imminent threat"" that needed to be dealt with immediately. But ""911"" is also about much more than that. It is about corruption in all of politics and how that effects those of us in this country who still believe that America is a great place and freedom is a great blessing. The caveat in this movie is that our freedoms are under assault, not from without bit from within(,e.g the Patriot Act, illegal immigration, the silencing of the media)and the only way that we can protect that freedom is by dealing with the cold, hard facts.\n\n  So we can harp on the fact that Michael Moore is an overweight guy who dresses like a slob or we can attest to the fact that he makes one hell of a documentary and forces us to think.";The Heat Is On the Neo-Cons

Much of the footage was assembled rather than shot by him, and speaks for itself.\n\nThe detractors who regard his documenting of grief as exploitation must prefer emotions served up sanitized or hidden altogether. The film so convincingly records the administration's manipulative exploitation of people's feelings and fears, that I marvel how people who see it can still delude themselves into believing that it's OK for their government to wage genocidal war abroad and war against their own liberties at home.\n\nI suspect that many of them might have watched the film, but not seen it. Michael Moore holds himself to a standard of truth that is light years ahead of that of our government.

Yet, this film is an example of a contrived presentation of the ""truth"" that can anger a Canadian, like myself, who is already against the war before watching the film's introductory credits.\n\nThis film is a work of propaganda that seeks to convince its audience to agree with a particular point of view by showing a collection of carefully screened and selected snippets of ""reality"".  Michael Moore interviews only those US soldiers that have doubts about the war.  Mr. Moore carefully chooses to interview a mother of a fallen soldier who is emotionally traumatized and angered by the on-duty death of her child, who had VOLUNTEERED (not conscripted) into the US military.  Mr. Moore thoughtfully decides to show footage of Iraqi children killed by US aerial bombardments rather than footage of Kurds massacred by Saddam's soldiers.  Mr. Moore deliberately wants us to watch scenes of US soldiers in Iraq arresting a terrorist/insurgent suspect (who could possibly be released later on) rather than a horrific scene of Saddam's secret police abducting a political dissident (who could well ""disappear"" forever).  Mr. Moore degrades America's coalition of allies by listing only the smaller allies (Morocco, Coasta Rica, etc.) and not mentioning the larger allies (Britain, Australia, etc.).  Thank you Mr. Moore for showing only what you want us to watch and omitting everything else that goes against your misguided anti-Bush crusade.  None of your facts are erroneous, but there are a lot of deliberate omissions designed to give a distorted view of ""reality"".  Further, Mr. Moore prefers to interview women rather than men, or rather, HYSTERICAL (and irrational) women who will provoke an emotional (rather than cool and rational) response from the audience.  Why doesn't Mr. Moore interview a parent of a fallen soldier who can rationally look beyond the death and understand the ""bigger picture""?  Further, it is not natural for any mother to become traumatized by the death of her baby boy even if he had died fighting a more ""just"" war such as the war against Nazi Germany?\n\nFinally, could Mr. Moore stop demonizing the Saudis?  The Saudis are like any other people, even if one is disgusted by their method of capital punishment (public beheading) which is actually more swift and humane than death by electricution or lethal injection.\n\nYet, I will give Mr. Moore's film some stars for showing us things that one does not see on CNN, but always watch with a critical eye!  For example, one learns from the film that the Bush family has business ties with rich Saudi families such as the Bin Laden family.  Then again, I personally find nothing nefarious and shocking about this Bush family secret.  Any member of the Bush family should be free to make money by associating with persons from so-called ""evil"" countries as long as this is done while not holding public office.  Unpatriotic, perhaps, but certainly not unethical.";Propaganda Alert!  Watch only with a VERY Critical Eye!

I really expected this film to be an indictment, but the movie was just transparent spin, cut and pasted.\n\n  Michael Moore should have tried to tie everything up more neatly. I also found the extended segment on the dead soldier's mother to be exploitative and beside the point. If decisions to go to war were determined by how much mothers loved their children, no one would ever go to war.\n\n  And just why did he include a Saudi beheading? How does that contribute to Moore's argument that the government is scaring us with terror alerts?\n\n  This movie is high on stimulus and low on cohesion.

It's usually clear that he's trying to make some point in his ""documentaries,"" but he never clearly states a point and defends it with evidence. He prefers to crash gates and rattle people and use the awkwardness of the situations to make the subjects look bad rather than arguing a point or smartly dissecting an issue.\n\nIn ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" however, Moore produces his most journalistic piece of work to date. Yes, there are plenty of moments in which he has injected his bias, his commentary. But there are plenty of facts -- evidence, anecdotes, quotations, records, first-person accounts, etc. You might not always agree with Moore's tone or how he has pieced together things, but you will be hard-pressed to challenge the facts he has presented in F911. And that's what it's all about, anyway -- putting forward more facts than are typically given by the mainstream media, who, quite frankly, are fearful of losing their access to the White House and who, like the general action-movie-going public, really do enjoy the excitement of explosions and battles and sexy news.\n\nMoore gives us more. And he does it in more than the 20 seconds you might get from TV news while not going overboard or muddying the waters with information that is not relevant to the core story. The core story is that that invasion of Iraq was not about Sept. 11. You're still left free to draw your own conclusions, too.\n\nEven when you do think Moore might have set someone up or taken something out of context, you still must remember that he uses multiple sources. OK, assume that the comments from the tank soldiers were stretched a little -- maybe a little out of context. Dismiss them entirely if you like, because they are just one example in a string of examples that Moore uses to show the humanity (or lack of humanity) with which the war was conducted -- in response to Rummy's on-the-record comments on the war's humaneness.\n\nAgain, Moore gives you more than one example for every point he addresses. If you don't like one of the examples, there are plenty more. It doesn't make the whole work without merit. (Remember, it IS still a work designed with a message in mind. It's not totally neutral -- but then the movie itself even gives strong evidence to show that mainstream reporters are not reporting the war in a neutral matter.)\n\nSo don't throw out the baby with the bathwater here. Recognize a fact when you see it. Dismiss the tone if you don't like it. But do think for yourself. Keep an open mind.

You will be missing out tremendously by not seeing this documentary.  The most important part of this film, in my opinion, was the last 5 minutes. When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not understand what the heck Mr. Moore was trying to get at in his narrative towards the end.  The second time I saw this movie, I finally understood what he meant/ and what point he was trying to make. I'm not going to ruin that part for you.

376;882.0;4.0;13.0;Michael Moore has made a name for himself as the consummate documentary director, creating many movies that present his take on a critical issue and that chronicle the moods of Americans and the world at the time. Fahrenheit 9/11 continues Moore's foray into political documentaries, this time focusing on the war against Iraq and the man who got us into the mess, George W. Bush.\n\nMoore spends most of this documentary talking about the war, but he begins the film with a presentation on the election of 2000 and how Republicans and their colleagues helped to rig the election in favor of Bush by purging minority groups from the voter roles in Florida. Then, he quickly shifts gears to the war itself, showing the president sitting in the Florida classroom as one of his aides whispers in his ear that the U.S. is under attack.\n\nWhat follows from there is Moore's attack on the president and his war, showing how Bush and his team manipulated facts and twisted the truth to get the American people to approve the war effort. Moore makes many personal attacks on Bush and he portrays the president as having a one- track mind and as being rather stupid. One of the major criticisms of this film is how it takes things out of context, and this does appear to be a valid complaint. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and others are shown making quotes to the camera and sometimes, they are quoted out of context. Moore includes a quote when he needs one, to drive his points home, regardless of how the quote was originally intended.\n\nWhere this documentary succeeds most is when it sticks to the facts. The parts that talk about the phony weapons of mass destruction claim and the use of fear to sell the war to the people are among the best in the documentary. Another thing that keeps the movie entertaining is Moore's sarcastic wit. One of the funniest moments in the film comes when Moore decides to drive an ice cream truck around the U.S. Capital and read the provisions of the anti Patriot Act through a loudspeaker. He does this after learning (accurately) that most of the people in congress voted for this anti- liberty measure without even bothering to read it.\n\nBesides the quotes taken out of context and the attempts to make Bush look either like a complete fool or a cold, uncaring villain, there are a few other things I didn't care for. I didn't like the sidetracking by Moore, such as when he shows scenes of abandoned businesses and houses from his hometown of Flint, Michigan- similar to what was shown in his first documentary, Roger and Me. And I felt he got a little carried away with Lila Lipscomb and her concerns about young people going off to war. This adds some good drama to the film, but I would prefer if he stuck with the facts.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 is a pretty good documentary even though it's obviously one- sided and gives no opportunities for any opposing viewpoints. Many people are angered at Moore for making this documentary while others applaud his efforts with great enthusiasm. Whatever position you take, you should still take some time out to watch this documentary. It shows how a group of people can successfully manipulate the truth and then add a dose of fear to the equation to convince millions of people that armed conflict is necessary and moral.;We Gotta Get out of This Place

440;888.0;5.0;13.0;I think it speaks volumes about the legitimacy of Moore's works when the best the right-wing idealogues can muster in opposition of his journalistic escapades is to call him names.  Yep, he's fat.  Very good of you to observe that.  Unfortunately, calling him fat doesn't lessen the shame of realizing you've been living in ignorance.\n\nIs he sensational?  You bet.  But in this day and age if you're going to get America's attention you almost have to be.  Does he ask the right questions?  Always.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a landmark piece of journalism for 21st century America - a must see for any concerned citizen who wants to know what conservative America would rather not know.;"God bless Michael Moore! ;-)"
461;889.0;5.0;13.0;"depend greatly on our own point of view.  Sorry to be quoting old movies but the last few months of blogfests have taught me how true Obi Wan's line was.  Moore has many facts dervied by many papers and stated by many authors.  His critics have the same thing, facts from others that support the opinion they want to express.  More often that not, p[eople will choose who to beleive based on who they WANT to beleive and not question the authenticity of any fact that supports their side.  And to be fair, this applies to both fans and critics of Moore.\n\nThis movie (for simple labeling purposes) got mislabeled as a documentary.  It's actually an editorial piece.  The quality of an editorial piece is in it's power to persuade people to it's opinon.  I generally like Moore's movies and books, and generally support his opinion, but the premis of Farenheit rubbed me the wrong way.  It tried to paint Bush as the kind of villan we don't see outside of Satuday morning cartoons or 1960s comic books.  Not to mention the president being involved in vast conspirices for money and world domination seemed so implausible when the last guy with the job could cheat on his wife without it being all over the news.\n\nWatching the move at release was interesting.  It painted a rather convincing picture, and taking into accounts the CBC news I watch, I was finding it harder to completely dismiss the conspiracy theories.  With the more recent news, from studies stating faulty intellegence about WMDs to freudian slips made by Bush during the live debates, from lost explosives to fresh hate mail from Bin Laden, I get afraid Moore may be right.  I'd prefer to think that Bushes less than stellar desicions were made due to a recationaly attitude to the irrational fear we all had after 9/11, but in the grand scheme of things, that isn't any less damning.\n\nThis movie is very powerful.  That's something that can't really be denied regardless of your political opinions.  It's simply Moore's version of events.  History will be the one to decide if he's the Pied Piper leading us to our death, or the lone voice chanting the Earth revolves aroung the Sun.  This movie will probably make most of us uncomfortible, and some may dissmiss Fareneheit because of those feelings, but I'm reminded of some words from one of my teachers: ""If I ever find myself in the position of being 100% ethically corect, I know my thinking's screwed up somewhere.""";Many of the truths we cling to..
489;890.0;5.0;13.0;This movie was extremely entertaining.  Even if some of the facts were twisted it's still necessary to watch this to get an idea of what a baboon of of president we have in office.

If you're looking for something that will inform you about who to vote for this coming election, turn to Farenheit 9/11.  There was plenty of footage of Mr. Dubya making an ass out of himself in a way that other presidents have not seemed to achieve.  For those of you conservatives who listen to Rush Limbaugh, this movie is no different than what he does.

That should be enough for any sane person who loves this country to demand these morons be kicked out of office.  Personally, I think that most of this film is probably right on target---I mean the facts are there to back up all of the claims Mr. Moore makes.  Thank God he has the courage to make a movie like this.  I am terrified for our country if Bush and his cronies are given another four years to destroy this country.  Even if you are the most closed-minded conservative Bush lover you MUST see this movie.  I have a feeling most of the reviewers who are critizing it haven't even bothered to watch it.  Open your eyes and see what is really going on.  It made me sick to my stomach to see innocent women and children slaughtered in Iraq and for what?  The undeniable truth is that no weapons were have been found or will ever be found.  Do you know why?  Because they don't exist--even Bush has admitted that.  Face the facts people---get him out of office.;God Bless You Michael Moore!
550;893.0;5.0;13.0;Unfortunately, most of these reviews don't actually review the movie as much as they declare reviewers' political affiliations.  If you take a step back, Michael Moore has compiled a documentary that raises key questions and highlights current issues.  Wether you agree with him or not is your business, however as a documentary, this is well put together and extremely thought provoking.  It is compiled mostly from released documents, news segments and historical facts, some of which seem to be questionable to the population at large.

I think individuals are smart enough to figure things out for themselves and this movie helps to shed light in areas never explored.  Regardless of how this movie is slanted there are many undisclosed and disturbing FACTS about the events of 9/11 and the war in Iraq presented here. This movie doesn't dog America!

656;899.0;1.0;13.0;"This movie destroyed every shred of liberalism in my body, and I am honest when I say that I was pretty much a left-winger when I went in.  To call this movie a ""documentary"" is to defecate on every worthy documentary ever made.  Half of the movie is a collection of clips in which George W. Bush speaks like a total idiot, and I agree that he is not a very good public speaker...at all.  But, that doesn't make a movie.  Anyone can watch him do that by watching television.\n\nIt is not entertaining to watch an overweight man with a greasy baseball cap get into an ice cream truck and read the Patriot Act into a loudspeaker while passing by several people, most of which are probably wondering what the heck he's doing.  The same goes for his little ""stunt"" with the Marine where the honorable Mr. Moore walks up to several Congressmen and asks them to send their sons to Iraq ""to help out over there.""  Apparently, this man has not heard of the concept of ""choice.""\n\nWhat really infuriates me is what happens in the last 45 minutes of the film.  Mr. Moore shamelessly exploits the unbearable grief Lila Lipscomb (a grieving mother who lost a son in Iraq) has to deal with.  He videotapes her while she relates the horrible moment when the phone call came in, and even follows her to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where she vents her cries and screams at the White House.  Everyone who has a heart has been sympathizing with everyone who has ever lost a child.  After viewing this part of the movie, I lost every ounce of respect I had for Mr. Moore.\n\nI read right through the Anti-American Michael Moore, and it is very clear that he is trying to get the whole country angry with the current President; he is also trying to get right-wingers to agree with him through the use of shock-value and by distorting the facts.  Congratulations, Mr. Moore!  You've not only failed with me, but you've accomplished the opposite of what you set out to do!\n\nThe paragraph above was the end of my review, and here comes the recommendation part.  I'm not going to say that I wouldn't recommend it, because this is the kind of movie that viewers will either love or hate.  If you are very liberal (not slightly, because that's where I was) and can't stand Dubya, I highly recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 (I know this is throwing off the whole attitude my review started with, but I'm being fair).  If you are conservative in any way, though, stay as far away from it as possible.";Heinous.

Making up what if's and falcifing stories is just lame. It is sad that people actually belive this is non-fiction. Its all a fake story he invented. Michael Moore is trying to use his massive influence for his political agenda, which saddens me. Funny thing is, he hates Kerry too, so who do his followers vote for?

As an American soldier that fought in Operation Enduring Freedom IV, I came home to this movie that totally belittled the US Army.  Mr Moore portrays the US Army as an organization that thrives on tricking young, poor, uneducated Americans into enlisting for the US Army.  While that is totally untrue he even still protrays the Army as a killing machine that enjoys killing innocent Iraqi civilians.  Althought the movie is dedicated to those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan; if you have an ounce of patriotism and pride for the country in which you live then I highly recomend passing on this movie.

I laughed for a while, until I was thoroughly insulted by the overall presentation...\n\nMichael Moore had an amazing and potentially convincing set of facts that he could have used as the basis for a genuinely moving condemnation of the current (and former Bush) administration(s). Instead, in the name of ""entertainment,"" he resorted to a presentation of material that is, at best, misleading, and at worst, outright deceptive. Not because of a lack of factual content-that was present. What wasn't present was a respectful presentation of information that even a moderately educated and open-minded person would hope for. The film resorts to overly emotional and exploitative presentation of facts that end up overshadowing the content that really could have had impact.\n\nI went into the film with high expectations. I wanted to see a balanced presentation of information that subtly and impressively drew conclusions regarding the lack of honesty and integrity of the current administration. Instead, I saw a poorly conceived attempt to make the President look like an idiot-and despite the fact that I personally have HUGE problems with the present administration, I left more angry with the insulting and emotional presentation of the facts Moore sited than with the actions of the Administration he was trying to condemn.\n\nSure, if you have leftward leanings, you might leave the theater shouting ""YEAH!!...See??? I told you Bush was a dishonest moron."" But then again, it's easy to pander to an audience that's already convinced of your main premise. It's preaching to the choir.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, viewers coming from the right hand perspective probably perceived the overly emotional and biased manner in which the information was presented, and left feeling nothing but insulted. Moore missed an opportunity to present facts in a credible manner that actually might have swayed people on that side of the aisle in the direction he hoped.\n\nSpeaking of swaying opinion, can anyone who saw this film actually believe that it could alter the opinion of anyone? It's a scary thought to me that people could be swayed by scenes like Moore's insulting presentation of the President in the classroom when he was informed of the first plane hitting the tower on 9/11. The dramatic music. The focus on the President's face that-if you watch-simply took a snapshot of time when his facial expression could have been interpreted as confused. And you know what, he might have been confused for a moment at that time. What was the plane? A commuter jet? A prop job? What should he have done? Jumped up in the middle of a room full of children and shouted ""Holy SH*&^, kids. We're under attack!! Get under your desks!!!"" Gimme a break. Could he have gotten up, and gracefully and quickly exited at that point? Sure. He stayed with the children in that classroom for 7 minutes. Maybe that's 6 minutes too long. I don't know. Moore offered no real alternatives to what should have been or could have been accomplished at that point in time.\n\nI consider myself to be a centrist. I no longer identify with either Party-partially because of the partisan crap that is personified by this movie, as well as it's poorly thought out literary response by the right, ""Unfit for Command"" (yeah, sure, it was initiated by Swift boat personnel, right...). It's films like this and books like that that make me want to avoid the entire political process-because everything get presented on such a slant that I just tend to fall right off.\n\nIt seems to me that we'll only make real progress toward bipartisanism when somebody actually steps up to the plate and says ""I will not engage in the political rhetoric that is intended to impugn the integrity of people on the other side of the issue."" Some people say that you have to fight fire with fire. No you don't. You fight fire by taking a different road that leads to real integrity. You don't engage in the childish argument that says ""Well, they shot first, so we had to respond.""\n\nThis film does nothing more than continue to drive a wedge between people, pander to its already zealous audience, and insult the integrity of its viewers.\n\nAnd it's a damn shame, becaue Michael Moore had the facts that people need to be exposed to.";An unfortunate missed opportunity......

That its main target is richly deserving of our contempt and mockery does not change the fact that this film is intellectually incoherent, contradictory and too full of baseless assertions, fatuous ""reasoning"" and downright untruths. The sole fact that he completely ignored the dominant role of Israeli-loyalist neoconservatives in starting the war is reason enough to discount the whole movie. I'm as big an opponent of the president as there is, but let's get a few things straight: he did not steal the 2000 election by disenfranchising black voters in Florida. A bunch of idiots who weren't on the voting rolls because they hadn't voted in 10 years, were felons, went to the wrong voting district, or who were never registered to begin with got mad because they couldn't pollute the system with their illegal votes. The Bush family may be too close to the Saudis, but that didn't cause 9/11 and it wasn't Bush who allowed the bin-Laden family out of the country after 9/11- it was Bush's nemesis Richard Clarke, who only did so after the FBI said that they were not suspects. And if Bush were such a puppet of the Saudis, why did he invade Iraq against the vehement opposition of those same Saudis? And the way Moore portrays it, it's only the poor defenseless black kids who are being victimized by slick and dishonest military recruiters- it's actually rural white kids who are disproportionately represented on the front lines of this war. The military cannibals will take their prey wherever there is poverty and lack of opportunites. No, the real power of this film is in its images, not Moore's discombobulated attempt to fit them all together into a coherent whole. The look on our idiot's president's face as he sat dumbfounded in that Florida classroom for 7 minutes on 9/11 is worth the price of admission(even though I actually bought a ticket to Spider Man and snuck into Fahrenheit to avoid supporting Moore). The scenes of Iraqi atrocities, Bush's arrogance and juvenility, and the unctuous Congressman's reaction when Moore suggested having his son enlist are also great ones. This propaganda movie isn't going to contribute to general enlightenment. It will provoke Bushies, and serve as red meat for lefties, but it will certainly influence the moron majority for whom this film will serve as their only source of information on the state of our country.

Alas, though, its focus was not only one-sided, but also ironic.  It condemed Bush as if he was the root of all evil, yet did nothing to report all the wrongdoings which have been done by some of America's greatest presidents.  Michael Moore simply has a beef with the world because his hometown of Flint is a welfare ridden town because the people there obviously cannot get jobs.  I do not really know why this is, but I can garantee you that if I lived in Flint I would see to it that I had a job and I would work my ass off just like I do now.  I think that the people in Flint need a lesson in hard work, and not a merely a scapegoat, that being the president.

Riding around in an ice cream truck is the level of sophistication Moore uses.\n\n Also, he uses a grief stricken mother of a soldier killed by militants - sheer explotiation when she asks God ""Why did you send my boy to die?"" and Moore uses it in political attack.\n\n Also, the Bin Laden family has proven that the dates of leaving the US were wrongly reported in the film as is the doctored front page story about Gore 'election' (it was a letter to the editor title!).\n\n Overall, over the top accusations which have been proven wrong or are just American-hating. Ultimately this independent voter was turned off the so-called Leftist version of the 'truth'.";Interesting but ultimately just spouting off and irritating
1171;919.0;1.0;13.0;How can so called educated people be deceived into thiking that this piece of a demented man's mind could be conceived as a movie or a documentary.  It is not even entertainment.

1178;920.0;4.0;13.0;"I wouldn't complain so much about Michael Moore if 1) he wasn't so crummy to people who don't deserve it (I don't mind when he picks on the head of GM or Charlton Heston), and 2) if he didn't have the disturbing ability to insert himself into touching private moments that don't need Michael Moore's presence.\n\n Happily, both of these tendencies are mostly absent from Fahrenheit 9/11. Republicans and Democrats take it on the chin, but the ""average Americans"" are offered up without condescension, a rarity in the past for Moore. (He does get a few cheap shots at small countries like Costa Rica and Iceland, though.)\n\n As for my second point above, it might be useful to compare two scenes. In Bowling for Columbine, we get a scene where Moore comforts a woman on camera. The woman needs comforting; Moore is there; he comforts her. But there's something smarmy about the event ... it's not clear why we have to see Moore with his arm around the woman, except to point out that Michael Moore cares. In Fahrenheit 9/11, however, there are several emotional scenes, particularly those with the woman whose son was killed in Iraq. Moore remains mostly off-camera for those scenes ... he lets us see the woman's grief, it's powerful and important to what Moore is trying to say, but he leaves it be, he doesn't insert himself for no reason.\n\n As usual, Spinsanity takes on Moore's cavalier attitude towards facts, and there's plenty to kvetch about, but even here, Moore is improving. As Spinsanity notes, the film ""appears to be free of the silly and obvious errors that have plagued Moore's past work."" They do go on to note that the movie ""is filled with a series of deceptive half-truths and carefully phrased insinuations that Moore does not adequately back up,"" but to be honest, that doesn't bother me much ... I have no objection to Moore the rabblerouser, editing his footage for maximum impact, I just don't like it when he lies. And there would appear to be very few lies in Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\n I'd have to say there's some irony in the fact that Fahrenheit 9/11 is Moore's most successful film at the box office, and also the least ""entertaining."" Perhaps Moore should have been trusting his audience all along to get his arguments, without the cheap stuff.";Moore's best film is his least entertaining
1186;921.0;1.0;13.0;"This movie, or documentary, or whatever the hell it's being called these days is really nothing more than a two-hour campaign ad. Politics should not be debated in the movie theater. That space is reserved for tv ads nearing November. The ""facts"" stated by this mockumentary are biased and disillusioned. Not only are the clips pieced together in discriminatory ways, but they also are placed in such ways as to further the Democratic effort. It doesn't need help from big, fat, white men. The basis of this movie is pure hatred. Hatred for America and hatred for our current president. It isn't against Michael Moore's constitutional rights to release such crap, but if any voters base their opinions off of such a movie, then America is in for a whole lot of trouble. The purpose of this movie is to cause hatred. Al-jazeera television can stir up enough of this around the world, so we don't need hatred right here in America.";Liberal Propaganda
1188;922.0;5.0;13.0;Watching that movie was a real catharsis. Moore exposed what I believed in for more than a year. I was able to see the hidden agenda before the attack on Iraq, but everyone around me, including my partner, were all gung ho for it. They were totally brain washed by CNN, Fox and others. I felt alone. Now Michael has vindicated that feeling, and everyone is able to see what I felt and believed (of course I was following the international media and that helped). Michael: I like your style. You are able to portray a serious situation in a very entertaining way.

1236;925.0;2.0;13.0;I just arrived home from seeing Fahrenheit 9/11.  I went in a great supporter of Michael Moore - I own ALL of his books and DVDs, and I would count myself as a biased supporter IN HIS FAVOUR.  As such, my opinion of the film surprises me more than anyone.\nThe film lost a lot of credibility when Mr Moore was listing the countries involved in the coalition of the willing.  Many small countries were named, but neither Australia nor England were mentioned.  An amazing oversight.\nAlso, I was deeply offended by the way in which Saudi nationals were presented at the beginning of the film.  I am sure that Mr Moore would be amongst the very first to agree that not all Saudi people are criminals.  It is obviously absurd to even suggest such a thing.  And yet, during the film he seemed content to find any picture of a known political figure with a person wearing the Saudi national dress as an example of collusion.  I was not alone in seeing this as a very unbalanced portrayal.\nI went into the film a strong supporter.  I left with more questions than answers, and the knowledge that this is one DVD that I will not be buying.;I can't believe I am writing this....

1277;927.0;4.0;13.0;This film is partly documentary in the ordinary sense, but it stands to reason that the documentary elements serve a larger objective, which is to ridicule and demean the 43rd President of the United States. The film is `satire' basically, in the sense that the magazine Private Eye, which has a certain international distribution, is satire. Its modus operandi is basically to select and highlight whatever will show up its subject in the most unfavourable way, and to bolster its selections with a cartoon treatment of the principal actors in the drama. As the work of a committed opponent of this president and this war it doesn't attempt `balance', and I'm at a complete loss as to why anyone ever expected it to. One doesn't expect a prosecuting counsel to show balance, and Moore is an advocate making a case.\n\nIt's also in the nature of the case that the more anyone investigates and thinks about political situations the more unedifying details turn up. This puts supporters of this particular war in an awkward bind, because sooner or later they have to explain what their standard terminology actually means. Supporting the troops, for instance, might mean wishing them a safe return. On the other hand it might also mean wanting them to continue doing what they're doing, and anyone advocating that can reasonably expect to be asked why. Similarly, fighting for one's country might mean defending it from attack. However it's hardly reasonable to condemn Iraqis for doing exactly that on their own soil, or for simply disagreeing with the proposition that the intruders know what's best for them. Stressing the positive aspects of the operation would be a quagmire too, as someone doing that is liable to come across as a complete lickspittle doing Moore's job for him even better than he's done it himself. The clip from the actress whose solution is not to think about the issue at all but to give unswerving and unquestioning loyalty seemed to me perfectly fair and to the point, as that is precisely what many are doing in practice. The usual attempts to hitch patriotism to this dismal outlook only highlight its uncomfortable suggestion of Goebbels.\n\nBy the time this film was made I expect most thinking people had long made up their own minds about it all - and indeed most unthinking people including the actress who believes that thinking is a bad idea. There are probably not many converts to be made, but there will be some, and this film can only encourage people to use their brains, however reluctantly. In the main it will entertain those who share Moore's basic outlook and enrage those who don't, and I imagine that is the general idea. I had done my own analysis of the issue ages ago, but I was still startled by the revelation of just how little legislation the US Congress actually even reads. If the issue were, say, drainage in rural communities, that might be bad enough. When it turns out to have been true of the Patriot Act it seems to me that those who routinely identify liberty with everything their country does need to wake up. All in all, the film is not quite my idea of a 5-star effort but it's a very effective rehash of familiar arguments whether one feels it really justifies the hype that has attended it or not.;LAMPOON

1319;930.0;5.0;13.0;"Michael Moore's movie ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a friendly and implacable reminder that the nature of democracy is that it takes eternal vigilance to keep it. If we want to be free, we have to practice the principles of freedom. One of them is open and transparent dialogue about the actions of the leaders of the republic. When one of those leaders, be they the mayor of the town council or the president of the United States, acts in ways that trample on and defeat the principles of democracy, it is then necessary for those acts to be exposed.\nIt is apparent from this documentary that the Bush family has had and continues to have a long and inglorious relationship with the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden family. It was especially nauseous to find out that the Bush administration allowed members of the bin Laden family and principle members of the Saudi royal family to leave the United States immediately after the attacks of 9/11. Just what were they thinking? That we would never find out?\nAnother principle is that behavior has consequences. The acts of the Bush family in support of the ""haves and have mores"" has helped those individuals reap an obscene amount of money from the suffering of others. The consequence for the Bushes are that one more of their family members will have the chance to go down in history as another one-term president.";Film shows Bush links to Saudis
1340;931.0;5.0;13.0;Michael Moore's new documentary puts together lots of known facts about Bush in a way that is very damaging to this hale-fellow-well-met Prez who has not the brains, creativity or courage to be a real leader for the country. Too bad for us. I read a lot of reviews before I saw the movie, so I was prepared for most of it (some of the war scenes were pretty horrific, though).  But the part that made me most proud to be an American was the coda at the end where he talked about the brave sacrifice our troops were making, most of them from the middle and lower classes, and for what? $17K/year and the chance to get killed for a pointless revenge trip on the part of the President.

1471;937.0;2.0;13.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 will disappoint the non-partisan viewer twice: on the way in and on the way out.\nOn the way in, I came to the movie expecting a biting, hilarious satire of the present administration a la Saturday Night Live's ""Strategery"" silliness, perhaps with a serious point to make. What the first two-thirds of the movie actually provided, however, was merely unflattering video footage of Bush 43 and others in the administration overlaid with conspiratorial commentary that we're all familiar with involving Florida, Texas Air National Guard, Halliburton, Prince Bandar, etc. I thought that there was a lot of raw material there, but I fell asleep twice during this part.\nThe one part of the movie that began to live up to these expectations shows Moore in Washington with a handful of Marine Corps enlistment documents trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist. That was funny, and it had a point to make, but that was all there was of this sort.\nWhat woke me up was the amazing videotaped story of Lila Lipscomb. She works at a welfare office in Flint, MI (Moore's hometown) and has two children in the military. In the initial interviews we see her describing herself as a conservative Democrat who is proud of the work she does, proud to be a part of the American Middle Class and proud of her children's service.\nThen her son is killed and we see her transformed by her grief. That, plus some scenes of amputee veterans brings a very somber and serious tone to the movie. But it goes nowhere in particular with it, and it contrasts incongruously with the first part of the movie. So, the second disappointment is on the way out ... the movie could have been a lot more but its slanted, partisan failed-attempt at satire ruined it.\nThe other movies at Cannes must have been dull, because this one is not all that great.";Disappoints Twice

127;939.0;1.0;12.0;"Let me start by saying that this film doesnt tell the truth! About now you think I am a GOP fan boy. However the film doesnt tell the truth because mr Moor doesnt go far enough. Yeah we all know the Bush's have oil dealings with Saudi Arabia. The problem is thats only the surface of the corruption. Following is a list of things this film skips over.\n\nOn the morning of Sept 11\n\n- Standard air defence mechanisms systematically failed, simultaneously. When a plain deviates from course an attempt is made to contact the plain. If there is no responce Jets are scrambled to intercept the plain and guide it back to the airport. This is actually pretty common. It happens about 60-100 times a year. Without fail there is an innocent explanation for the course deviation nearly all the time. Now the fighter jets that scramble are far faster than any jetliners and if this happened on the morning of 9-11 the fighter jet would have reached the first plain in time to shoot it down. Now assuming the military was just incompitant as the administration would have you think. Than why were they still asleep for the next 3 attacks? The military records of that morning suggest that interceptor jets were scrambled too late, too slowly and from the wrong locations. An interesting side note is usually when there is a failure of this magnitude someone is punished or fired. In the case of 9-11 the military commanders in charge were promoted! Another interesting fact is that fires could not have caused the collapse of the towers. No high rise has ever collapsed due to fires. The idea that the fire melted the steal beams and the towers collapsed is dead wrong. To melt the steal beams the fires would have to be far hotter than 2000 degrees. Experts say the fire from jet fuel is hot but not hot enough. Now assuming the tops melted and collapsed don't you think the floors below would have at least momentarily provided resistance to the collapse? Instead both buildings collapsed in under 15 seconds. For a building that tall that is free-fall speed. Also the first two firefighters that came the closest to the 80th floor where impact was made thought the fires were manageable. They didn't describe a raging inferno. Istead they radiod for two lines to be brought up to put out two isolated fires. Minutes later without warning the towers collapsed on them. Prior to the collapse the seismologist at Columbia university recorded two spikes indicating large burst of energy that shook the ground just before there collapse. They were 2.1 and 2.3 on the richter scale respectivly. You couple that with dozens of survivors who's testimony says they heard other explosians on other floors prior too the collapse. A building colapsing on its own would not have produced all the dust that you see in in the video. Only a high energy explosian can reduce concrete to dust. If you can think back to that day on the news about 5 pm  they announced that building 7 collapsed. It was said that fires once again melted a 47 story steal frame building. Later on the govt changed there story and admitted it was pulled. Pulled is the technical term for demolishing a building. Why did they lie to begin with? Could they have also detonated the towers? We will never know if the steel in the debris tested positive for explosive residue,since before they could be examined the steel was sent on ships to china to be sold as scrap metal! Than there is the stock market. There was massive short selling of stocks just before the attacks. American and United Airlines as well as Morgan Stanly were involved. Somebody new ahead of time that these Airlines were going to down in the stock market. Morgan Stanly had offices in the world trade center. All three were affected by the attacks. Somebody profited millions by shortselling these stocks. Another good question is how could the pentagon been attacked? It is the most highly defended building in the wetern hemisphere yet they say a plain hit it. And this is after the govt already new we were under attack.\n\nAnyways I could give you details forever. I suggest that you just read a good book like The New Pearl harbor. If you cant read go to infowars.com and buy the dvd 9-11 The Road to Tyranny by alex Jones. He is concerned with getting the truth out so there is no copyright on his dvd you can make copies and distribute them for free for educational purposes. As far as Moor is concerned I don't understand why he didn't bring out facts. He probably new no theatre would carry a movie that told the truth so he wouldnt make any money on it. He was more concerned with getting Bush out of the whitehouse by having people vote for Kerry. Let me make this clear the democrats are just as responsible. All they think about is there careers so they won't say anything extreme that might make them look ""un umerican"". The truth is extreme though.

I just knew this Michael Moore was nothing but a trouble maker, and that he should have spent his time on other better projects.\n\nThen, my daughter promised she would take me to dinner if I would only see it with her.\n\nWhen the camera honed in on Bush sitting in the class room reading ""my pet goat"", and then he found out about the second plane hitting the WTC, I expected to see him jump out of his chair and rush out of the room. I certainly would have seen Al Gore do this, and I expected no less from Bush. He sat there, biting his lip and shaking his head in acknowldegement, whether he intended it to be that obvious or not.\n\nI was glued to the edge of my seat from then on.\n\nMike Moore's use of scenes, while documenting what was happening throughout the film was superb. I had to hand it to him for showing scenes that we, as Americans, were not shown on National Television, or in our local Newspapers.\n\nWhen the film ended, I sat and bawled like a baby. I knew right then that this Country had been lied to and duped worse than any other dictator had ever done before in the history of this World; and he did it right under our sleeping noses. That is what I was the most angry about.\n\nI, after almost a year, would still recommend this documentary along with his ""Bowling for Columbine.""\n\nWow!

226;949.0;1.0;12.0;"Sometimes when someone believes so obsessively in a certain philosophy it becomes hard for that person to destinguish between opinions and facts. What one needs to keep in mind is that the ""facts"" cannot ""speak for themselves"" (as the editorial review says) if they are not believable as true facts or not sufficiently proven. The viewpoint in the film is weakly presented and seems to be based more on what Moore wants to be true than what he can prove to be true. The argument is tenuous and juvenile and reasoning is often subsituted by low and base satire, the kind that could be made of anyone (for example, footage of Paul Wolfowitz combing his hair with saliva or superimposing the heads of the party members on cowboys). The great irony is that Michael Moore never seems to consider the possible humor of filming a hypothetical documentary of himself trying reach around his fat to his less readily accessible parts in the shower or trying to fit into his briefs in the morning. The true shallowness of the film can be seen in one scene in particular, the scene where Moore is standing outside the congressional building passing out military enlistment flyers to congressmen asking them if they want their children to enlist. After a few hours of doing this, to the point where congressmen become annoyed with him and run away, he triumphantly concludes that his prediction was correct, that the congressmen would be repulsed by the flyers (although the thought probably never crossed Moore's mind that it may have been him repulsing the congressmen rather than the the flyers). The bottom line is that Moore seems to assume that proof is not necesary, that all people everywhere will automatically agree with him and the liberal doctrine and do not need to be presented with a mature argument of why they should follow it. I am sure that many Moore-ist liberals will go ahead and vote this review ""not helpful"" simply out of suspicion that I disagree with the film, but there are no ""facts"" in it that ""speak for themselves."" The only thing that speaks for itself is the obsessive urgency to sway the election results, an attempt that in the end proved to be inconsequential and unsuccesful.";I wonder who the Amazon editorial reviewer voted for....
235;950.0;4.0;12.0;"When Farenheit 9-11 first came out, I was not emotionally ready to see this film.  I was afraid it would bring back the trauma I felt in 2001.  I had visited the World Trade Center as a child and a teen.  New York City was one of my favorite places to visit.  I went there about twelve times before I turned 18.  I finally decided that I would never really be ready, so I decided to watch it.\n\nMoore devotes very little screen time to the day of 9-11, having only a minute of audio and another few minutes of stunned N.Y.C. passersby and a shot of the missing persons' wall.  In a way I was both disappointed and relieved.  I did want to see that day from Moore's perpective, but then again, why relive the images we all saw that day and for days after?  I was not traumatized, but I was deeply disturbed - for political reasons.\n\nMichael Moore's Farenheit 9-11 is unquestionably anti-Bush and biased.  But Moore's evidence of conspiracy-like connections between the Texas Bush family and the Al Saud royal family of Saudi Arabia is brilliant.  The volume and scope of Moore's research is staggering.\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of the most controlled and restrictive countries in the world.  The government follows a fundamentalist Wahhabi Islam that no other country adheres to.  The U.S. State Department says in their Human Rights report that Saudi Arabia is guilty of torture, violence towards women and children, and throwing people into prison for circulating petitions.\n\nSo disturbing is the fact Bush allowed all of the Bin Ladens in the U.S. to flee the country two days after the disaster, without letting law enforcement question the family members.\n\nThe Saudi-Bush connection is not the only target of Moore.  He targets the military for actively recruiting young, poor minorities in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Moore also interviews some troops who have deep reservations about the war and about their commander-in-chief.\n\nIn the beginning of the documentary, the botched Florida election results and the plea of African-Americans to the U.S. Senate brings shame on George W. Bush and the Senate.  Moore portrays Bush as a yokel, but a sly one, with vast power and connections that seem to make him unstoppable.\n\nI am incredulous that even after Farenheit 9-11 was such a big smash at the box office, that Bush was re-elected.  After we viewed the film, my husband said, ""Bush has no conscience.""  Isn't that a scary thing to say about your president?  But after seeing this film, it is the logical conclusion.";Farenheit 9-11 Burns

I saw the movie at home, and Moore does not make an endorsement of any candidate or political party.

For example, how do we distinguish the ""bad"" guys from the civilians in Iraq?  Seems like a pretty easy job in simplistic land, but in reality there is a lot of grey.\n\nThis was the first ANYTHING that dared to question the status quo and consequently the Bush administration and its policies.\n\nThink about that for a second: the first ""anything"" that questioned the administration.  You can call it a work of fiction if you like, but even then it was still the first anything that questioned the administration.\n\nHow many of you have studied history?  If you have, you can use examples from political, military, sociological, even financial history to easily and conclusively demonstrate that ""bad"" things happen whenever someone or group is left unchecked or even unquestioned.

Sociological example - Tuskeegee Syphilus Experiments in the US.  Financial example - Nick Lesson and Barclays, Enron, WorldCom, every single financial analyst on CNBC in the late 1990's.\n\nSo perhaps, just maybe, history has told us that unchecked power is not a good thing, and because of this any attempt to question that unchecked power should be well-received by all men, especially in a time of war.\n\nPS - Think for yourself-It is more laborious, but it just might save your life sometime.";Is everything in its Perfect Context?

Bush spent the time ina classroom on 9/11/01, He then found out about the attacks, and said basiclly screw it, Ill remain reading to these kids, while millions of innocent americans are being killed, hes basiclly sayin its not him he doesnt care, and it also shows that only 1 member of the congress has a soldier in Iraq, other than that the poor kids are the only ones there, Moore went around and got 2 thats right TWO people to EVEN listen to him about that, out of all the members of the congress, TWO PEOPLE listened, and only one of those two, slightly agreed, This film shows how Bush is not fit to be president, and how greedy, and careless the repulic really is about the average american, and guess what Bush was re-elected in November of this year, that shows how stupid people can be, Moore made this documentary or film or whatever you call it in hopes of getting Senetor John F.

364;958.0;2.0;12.0;"As someone who voted for Bush in 2000, but not in 2004, I can certainly appreciate a great many of the criticisms found in this film.  I think more conservatives should take off their ideological blinders so they may see that the conduct of this administration is not as perfect as the Sean Hannitys and Rush Limbaughs of the world would have you believe.  With that, I found the facts presented in this film to be disturbingly rank with bias.  One could easily make a scathing indictment of the Bush administration by presenting all the facts, not just the negative ones.  For example, while it is clear that we have not been ""greeted as liberators"" as predicted by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, there are those in Iraq who are eternally grateful for the job our soldiers are doing.  I am just scratching the surface.  Research the facts presented in this film, and you will find that they only tell half of the story.  I gave this film two stars because it did bring to light a few interesting points and I thought the piece on the grieving mother of the fallen soldier was very well done.  I think this film is definitely worth watching, just take what you see with a grain, no, make that a tub of salt.";Moore presents facts too selectively

HOW ON EARTH CAN I SAY SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE?\n\nMichael Moore's movie, while incontestable on the subject of Iraq and WMD's, the ridiculousness of the supreme court actions regarding the recount, and no senator signing any African-American protest to the vote, has no business borrowing from Ray Bradbury or 9/11 for titular material. Sure our military is in Iraq allegedly because of that day, but he should have titled it BUSH/10W-40 instead. Eyewitness accounts of the ""attacking"" planes having no windows and not even being American airlines at all have less credibility than Moore's manipulation of the 2000 election coverage? Not a single clip of the collapsing WTC tops in a free fall because the bottoms of the towers disintegrated underneath? Why wasn't the preposterous fact that the Bush administration and most media networks propagated such utter nonsense by  telling us that  the collapse of the hurricane force resistant  WTC was because the burning jet fuel (basically the kerosene in our heaters) melted steel and the tops came crashing through the rest of the towers? All of this in complete defiance of the of the laws of nature?\n\nYes, this movie is patriotic in that it reeks with dissent which I believe is VERY American. But to absolutely positively ignore the science of planes hitting buildings and having those buildings selectively preserve or destroy terrorist DNA and two of the buildings undergo total pulverization because their tops on September 11, 2001 were all of a sudden too heavy to support were some things that really needed attention.

746;973.0;5.0;12.0;Moore's film, an exercise in political spin, was obviously inspired by the political manipulations of one Karl Rove, Bush's political guru and master of double-speak.  There has been a lot of hue and cry about Moore's political ax to grind and this film wears it on its sleeve.  There is no doubt that Moore despises everything Bush stands for and that is the beauty of the film -- its unambiguous disgust at the current administration and their web of lies and deceit.\n\nGranted, Moore pushes the envelope in terms of making his points.  Some of his facts are indeed somewhat exaggerated and the juxtoposition of imagery is obviously manipulated to reinforce his points.

I would be willing to bet, based on the content of several of the negative reviews on this site, at least 80% of the people have not seen this film.  Most of the facts in this movie are supported by many sources, including: The 9/11 Commission Report, The House of Saud, and Against All Enemies (Richard Clarke).\n\nWhile I don't agree with some of Moore's labor-related ideals or some of his more elaborate conspiracy theories, I believe that there is something better for this country, and George W. Bush is not it.;Thought Provoking and Very Partisan
791;975.0;4.0;12.0;I'm not an automatic Michael Moore fan. I think his manipulations are often far too obvious and his constant wisecracks and slacker 'average' guy shtick is tired and sometimes offensive.\n\nI saw F 9/11 expecting more of the same. Impassioned appeals to patriotism, silly gags on powerful people and some good, honest criticism. For the most part, the film delivered - it was flag-waving, patriotic and mind-numbingly manipulative at times. But I left the theatre feeling vindicated in some way: for once, a mainstream movie was talking about the ugly side of the American Imperial project and did so in a very well-researched and thorough, yet entertaining way.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nMoore spends a lot of time in the film exploring the connections between the Bush family and big Saudi and American money. It's a complex relationship and I think it's extremely important for people in the States to understand this. Bin Laden's own family were allowed to flee the states without any formal questioning. The US invaded Iraq although it posed no immediate threat. Bush's buddies routinely get contracts for weapons building and 'reconstruction' projects when there are wars. For the first time in a mainstream film, the connection between politics, corporations, profit and war were made. And i think it's a connection that is very hard to ignore.\n\nAlthough Moore doesn't get too involved in the racism that Arab Americans have suffered post 9/11, he does spend some time on the fact that the US Army is desperate for young recruits and often goes into poor neighbourhoods, with plenty of people of colour to prey on, in order to fill its ranks. The scenes in Flint following around Army recruiters are classic documentary filmmaking. Moore backs off and lets these folks speak for themselves. It's powerful.\n\nWhat i didn't like:\n\nThe opening scene and the soppy patriotic undertones. The whole scene with the mother whose son died in Iraq. Moore spends WAY too much time with her. Maybe it's because i'm not an American, but it seems pretty obvious to me that if you loose a child in a war that the world is largely very critical of, you're going to turn around and put some blame on the president who lead your son to death. I found this scene long, manipulative and I found Moore insincere and trying way too hard to make a point. I also didn't like the silly montage of countries that supported bush's war. Moore goes far out of his way to belittle them - it gets racist at some points and just plain dumb at others.\n\nOverall all though, I thought it made some very timely and important arguments. That Bush and his friends, family and supporters are very powerful business people with direct profits to be made in the business of war.

Capturing the best elements of Reefer Madness, Birth of a Nation, and the works of Heinrich Himmler, Fahrenheit 9/11 has undoubtedly staked out its place in the annals of great documentary.\n\nPrepare to have your presuppositions and values put to the fire in the cinematic pyromania that only Mr. Moore can supply. In addition to deconstructing the ""lies"" and ""half-truths"" that the proletariat have been brainwashed into accepting (via journalism, the Internet, rap music, personal experience, anecdotes), the true ""people's champion"" provides some startling revelations...For instance:\n\n*There are TWO President Bushes!*\n\n*During Saddam's reign, the Iraqi people lived in peace, flying kites*\n\n*Most U.S. Congressmen cannot read* :(\n\nUpon first hearing the title Fahrenheit 9/11, I have to admit I was a little skeptical. After all, Bradbury's book/film (trite account of utopian society where all books/independent thought are incinerated) of a similar name was a complete drag. But in true heroic fashion, Moore charges headlong into scandal, armed with nothing more than his girth, camcorder, legions of high-priced lawyers, and an ice cream truck. It's little wonder that some obscure British journalist called Mike ""the most important living American."" Such valor would normally warrant a Congressional Medal of Honor or an induction into the Justice League...But alas, a right wing conspiracy is in effect...Maybe in a better time...a better place...Moore will receive his just desserts.

29;986.0;4.0;10.0;"Let's face it. Chances are you either loved or hated this film before you even saw it. Personally, I liked it a great deal. I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? This lack of trust is important in the context of the current 2008 Presidential election cycle. It has seen an unusually high level of participation of young people and it has seen voters of all ages largely rejecting potential nominees perceived as Washington insiders. Much of this can be traced back to the level of cynicism Moore displays in this film.\n\nAlso, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about ""his base - also known as the haves and the have mores"". What could have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think that although it is somewhat dated at this point, it is still an important film and is worth viewing - just realize that this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go over the top quite a bit.";Good exploration of Iraq war...with some over-the-top moments

957;990.0;5.0;12.0;I think that this movie transcends so called left or right thinking. Mainly it is about political, militairy and economical manipulation and about the cynical and macabre way this game is played. Offcourse it is aimed at the Bush administration and US policy in general. I think Michael Moore does a terrific and courages job in showing the machinations behind the Bush election and his war efforts. It mercilessy gives us a look at a stolen presidency (with the shocking footage of a hammering Al Gore in the Senate while us representatives try to oppose the outcome of the elctions) and the range of lies, crinimal intentions and acts by the Bush administration. For me, it confirmed things I already was worried about. For instance, the support Bush senior gave to Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. Also the war on Iraq was a deliberate attempt to attack this nation, for reasons which had nothing to do with arms of mass destruction.\n\nMoore does not go as far as accusing Bush for ignoring or 'staging' the 9/11 WTC attacks, but he clearly points out the (hidden)plane flights for the Bin Laden family after the attacks, and the way (public and private) investigations to the causes of the attacks were blocked. The question remains: what did Bush c.s. know or deliberatly did't WANT to know in relation to the WTC attacks? just look at the benefits for the administraion (patriot laws, wars on taliban and hussein, oil reserves in iraq, profits for us business, safety of israel) and one day, as every US politican or priest always claims, the truth will set us free.

Among other things, his claims that the Bush administration sheltered and flew the BinLaden family out of the country after the attacks of 9/11 were proven to be false by the 9/11 Commission.

1173;1000.0;5.0;12.0;"I saw this movie on Mon. June 28th with a packed house in St. Louis. I went in trying to view the movie with an open mind knowing that it is not a true documentary where the director follows a timeline of events and lets the viewer come to their own conclusion. No, Michael Moore let's us know from the get go that he has an agenda to sell and he is going to sell his way, with direct, sometimes overhanded, and emotive, but ultimately factual. What Mr. Moore does provide, even though it is sometimes disjointed and ""leaning over the line like the Tinman in the 'Wizard of Oz'"" I.E., He states that Bush allowed a large contingent of bin Ladens and other Saudis, mostly students, to leave the United States immediately after 9/11, while commercial flights were still grounded. 'In fact, the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission has found that most, if not all, of these evacuations took place after Sept. 13, when the ban on commercial flights was lifted.'- New York Post 6/22.\n\n In the film, President Bush says of the war in Iraq,.. 'The fight for civilization.' Yet Moore shows the mismanaged and under-trained, and oft immature qualities of our young, 'lower-mid class to poor' soldiers who are doing the dirty work. A point that even the right-wing Fox pundit, Bill O'Rielly,t cannot deride, for even O'Rielly has stated in his own column...""Clearly, something is very wrong when inexperienced, poorly trained military reservists are allowed to run wild and abuse prisoners. Clearly, something is wrong when enormous mistakes are made in the occupation of a country whose defeat was a foregone conclusion. I mean everybody knew the USA would defeat Saddam, so why was the aftermath of the war so screwed up? Is this another intelligence failure? Is this a strategic failure on the part of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his team? We don't know because Mr. Bush rarely holds anyone publicly accountable for doing his or her job poorly.""\n\n The 'biggest' (pun intended) weakness of the movie is, Michael Moore. He actually becomes a detractor to his own message when he adds his contrived diatribe to the segement,'What was Bush thinking?' It ran like this: President Bush, with knowledge of the first WTC attack, sits with a classroom of children reading the book 'My Pet Goat', when his assistant breaks in to tell him of the second crash, Moore narrates with a glib cartoonish sarcasm while Pres. Bush sits with a 'deer-caught-in-the-headlights' look for over seven minutes AFTER he was told of the SECOND World Trade Center crash. Michael Moore unfortunately takes away from the classic footage, he should have let the film speak for itself.\n\n Another clear idea is the 'elite' tie-in. Connecting the dots is easy, from H.W. Bush to James Baker, to the Saudis, to Cheney and Halliburton and so forth. Clearly, the Saudis have an 'in' with the Bush's and their cronies. Ultimately, with this film Michael Moore preaches to the choir. The crossover audience between Mel Gibson's 'Passion of Christ' and Fahrenheit 9/11 is very small. Is it propaganda? Yes. Is it as Bill O'rielly states, ""na zi-like"" propaganda? No! The points Michael Moore makes are factual and the reality is sometimes disconcerting, but while the un-informed may wallow away in their ignorant bliss, others must fight an unpopular battle for truth and justice, and here, Mr. Moore is at his best. He ultimately gives purpose for anyone with a conscience to want to know 'WHY?....exactly why are we in Iraq?' Moore underscores 'Oil', but leaves numerous avenues open for discourse. I saw this movie on the same day as the 'secret' transfer of Coalition power to Iraq, June 28th. I left thinking the transfer was ceremonial and not another Bush 'triumph for democracy' as several leading news networks have claimed, for we are still losing our countrymen, both soldiers and contractors because....why?\n\n See the movie, judge for yourself";Are we polarized yet?

1212;1002.0;5.0;12.0;"Let me repeat an obvious insight of several other reviewers: If FAHRENHEIT 9/11 misstates any facts, Michael Moore is open to being sued. He has a seriously-vested interest in getting his facts straight, because there are probably a thousand conservative lawyers with ten million conservative dollars who'd love to nail his butt to the wall. As you read this, they are probably eagerly viewing and re-viewing F 9/11 for grounds for legal action. If they don't file suits--and right now it's four weeks and counting--it means they couldn't find any misstatements. In short, if there are no lawsuits, the right wing can engage in all the smear tactics it wants--but MOORE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.\n\n Stay tuned to Fox News; that's where you'll first hear about any lawsuits. On the other hand, I suspect it's going to be a long wait.\n\n Here are some of the points Moore makes, which are undisputed by anyone who has read the newspapers for the last 3 years with an open mind:\n\n 1. With a full recount, Gore would have won the state of Florida, hence the 2000 election. Right-wing pressure tactics extending up to the Supreme Court prevented a full recount.\n\n 2. There were unprecedented, large-scale protests at GWB's inauguration. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus attempted to keep the ""election"" from being certified by the Senate based on the egregious disenfranchisement of minority voters in Florida, but could not find any support in the Senate.\n\n 3. The Bush administration had warnings about the 9/11 attacks and chose to ignore them.\n\n 4. The President George W. Bush is an inarticulate man who spends a lot of time on vacation. On the other hand, he sometimes projects a warm persona to voters.\n\n 5. He's also a privileged rich boy who has been bailed out of every mess he's ever made in his life, and there have been a lot of them.\n\n 6. He doesn't like being questioned about his motives and policies, and he can be sarcastic and defensive in response.\n\n 7. Pres. Bush and his highest advisors lied to justify the invasion of Iraq.\n\n 8. The president's family and VP Cheney are neck-deep in financial ties and dealing with the Bin Laden family and with corporations which stand to make huge profits from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n 9. Like all wars, Iraq has led to the death and brutalization of innocents caught in the crossfire. These include U.S. soldiers.\n\n 10. Bush refers to the richest people in the U.S., the elite, as ""my base,"" and rules in their interest.\n\n 11. In contrast, the servicemen and women who are actually fighting in the Muslim world tend to hail from impoverished communities which have been on the receiving end of the president's economic policies.\n\n 12. The supposedly ""liberal TV news"" (I don't know whether to laugh or gag when I hear that phrase) have done an atrocious job of covering the truth about Bush.\n\n 13. There's a lot more, but the above are highlights.\n\n Parts of the film are funny. Moore has the satirical propaganda skills of Rush Limbaugh, along with far greater respect for the facts. Some of the film lags, especially if you've been reading the newspapers.\n\n But mostly it's sad, the saddest film of the 21st century to date, because so many Americans think so highly of this disastrous president, and display such hostility to fellow Americans.\n\n For me, the saddest and most terrible moment of FAHRENHEIT 9/11 comes when gold-star mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son was killed in Iraq, journeys to Washington and is confronted by a Bush supporter near the White House. Without bothering to talk to Ms. Lipscomb or learn her story, the conservative woman angrily asserts, ""This is all staged."" That's what's happening in our country today. Half of it is confronting the other half because they simply refuse to believe the clear misgovernment of an administration whose policies from Iraq to the economy to the deficit to the environment have been one disaster after another. In this election year, we Americans have to face an obvious fact: George W. Bush is incompetent, or worse.\n\n Just remember that he once said with a straight face, ""I'm a uniter, not a divider,"" and keep listening for the next lie.";The Saddest Film of the Year
1223;1003.0;1.0;12.0;Where are all these facts and statistics coming from?  The internet?  The news media?  The fact of the matter is that if you interviewed TRUE soldiers in our fine military (the ones that are here and the ones currently fighting in Iraq), an astonishing majority of them would tell you they will be voting for Bush again... 4 more years.  WOW!! These young soldiers who are being put in harm's way are supporting the Commander In Chief who sent them to Iraq in the first place.  Astonishing!  They must be making quite a difference over there that we are not hearing about.  Instead, people like Moore are bringing over a one in a million incident and blowing it up like it's common practice.  Give me a break people.\nMany of you say you think Bush is a liar and swear never to vote for another president that hasn't been in combat.  Why is this even an issue?

1253;1004.0;4.0;12.0;"Flawed, but when it's good it's really good.  Moore has done better in the past and is capable of more subtlety than shown here.  The first half is a waste, since everyone knows of Bush & Co's oil and Saudi ties, but Moore is stretching here.  The second half is more relevant and gripping.  Not much news here that isn't reported elsewhere.  But Moore does it with more verve than cable news and doesn't spare avenues that Fox and neocon media suppress, so I suspect many wingers will be shocked, while lefties have seen it before.  Nor will it change mindsets: lefties will push history faster than they can manage or comprehend, and righties will cling to the womb of various states of denial -- two of many themes in Moore's work that persist in F911.  My complaint is that Moore overworks his case.  Still, many sequences are chilling and masterful.  As for occasional shrillness, it appears that the right's overwrought demogogue and major whiner, Rush Limbaugh, has met his leftie counterpart in the more streetwise and droll Michael Moore (it's about time lefties borrowed some of the right's arrogance and flimflam, but I'd say Moore could be more effective if he didn't shout so much).  Limbaugh and Moore express views not shared by moderates like me, but Moore's style is cleaner, less juvenile, more coherent and professional.  His editorializing is an example of how NOT to make a ""great"" documentary - on the other hand, it's visually riveting and might be the biggest populist movie since Capra's films of the 40's.  I disagree with some of it, and it's sophomoric in spots, but I want the DVD so I can watch something with style and bite for a change instead of generic History Channel pablum, PBS handwringing, or right-wing rants and calumny.  3 stars for the politics and cinematic flaws, 5 stars for Moore's nervy delivery which, though personalized, at least avoids descending to Rumbaugh's level of meanness and bunk or Al Franken's unfunny cuteness.  Moore is easily funnier than Franken, who never said or wrote anything funny, period.  Moore's work has irony and satirical grit that neither Limbaugh's nor Franken's lack of talent can match.  A uniquely American documentary in presentation and attitude that should inspire 'doc' makers to be more creative.";Not Moore's best, but a fitting match for Limbaugh

1280;1007.0;4.0;12.0;... this is actually a very funny film. More political satire than documentary, Moore show Bush and Co with their pants at their ankles, and were it not for the fact that this dunce is supposed to be the leader of the free world, the film would stand up exceptionally well with any of Mel Brooks' great films of the seventies. Sadly, most of what is in the film actually happened, and though Moore jumps to conclusions on lots of stuff, in all honesty, his subject is such a complete dullard, I'm sure W'd go to the film and carp about the actor who played the President.\nThere's plenty to be concerned about here, yet Moore steers clear of indicting the Christian Fundamentalist Fascists who also have a large stake in seeing W re-elected. Ashcroft, a modern day Goebbels, Rumsfeld (did someone say Goerring) and Cheney (Herr Himmler, so good to see you again) play W like a fiddle and it shows clearly throughout this film. This is almost a scratch and sniff film, the odious nature of which comes through in the aforementioned quartet's reckless disregard for the truth all the way through to the moronic US servicemen extolling the virtues of some Dokken tune they listen to before they go out to kill. And to think we all thought Kubrik was stretching it a bit with Slim Pickens... (for the infantile ME and X generations out there, it's a reference to a film about nuclear war - ask your parents).\nAmong the questions running through my mind while I was watching this was how in the heck did Moore get his hands on the footage here. And why weren't Bush's handlers turning cameras off before W embarrassed himself and the Office. I was hankering for some trash talk from Potty-Mouth Cheney, but you just get him grousing about Halliburton allegations. You know he wants to wave the digit at someone but felt too repressed at the time.\nIt remains to be seen if the American public has the guts to vote for integrity. There is nothing in the history of the US since Reagan to suggest that the electorate will evaluate the candidates based on reality instead of ideology. More's the pity. The US has dug itself into several holes that it desperately needs to get out of, especially regarding its deficit, its moral standing and its ability to set a role model for democracy throughout the world. All empires collapse at some point. W is very much a Nero for the Twenty-First Century. Problem is that he doesn't just take the Roman Empire down with him as he fiddles about. Those of us north of the 49th parallel have grave concerns. We're way too close to that sucking sound of things going down the tubes.\nWe're all watching you people. Laugh at this film.

For instance cutting scenes of a early 2001 Condelleza Rice and Collin Powell saying that Iraq posed absoltly no threat to America or even its near neighbors, against scenes when they change they say Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. He had me sold from that point on. For those whom say Mr. Moore is unpatriotic, I tell you that patriotism without questioning is ignorance, ignorance should not be a American value. With taht I say, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulture, and Rush Limbaugh are COMMIES!!!!;Most important movie of the 21st Century
1354;1009.0;5.0;12.0;"---Why do the Nations Rage, and the peoples plot in vain?----\nPsalm 2:1\n--Vanity of vanities, all is Vanity-\nEcclesiastes 1:2\nThe Psalmist's, biblical poets, did not grow up in 21st century. They didn't see growth of the war machine. They would have probably asked why were fighting over oil. They never witnessed 9/11. Yet they understood that every generation has been through the Horrors of war. In that situation I think they asked some of the same questions, that Michael Moore did in his new Documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Of course the psalmist left us with a little more hope, ""Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling...Blessed are all who take refuge in him."" Whether you accept that, at least the thought of taking refuge in a sovereign God is more comforting then what Moore, on the other hand, leaves us with. Wallowing in despair, unable to move. I've seen the movie and while I think it brilliant I'm at a loss from what I should gleam from it.\nIn late 2000 it seems the election was stolen away from Al Gore by the Fox News Channel. It also seems the Democratic Party did nothing about it. Millions of voters, and local representatives were upset. But no senator's would lend their aid to the disenfranchised voters of Florida. Bush became president, he went on vacation, the economy went to crap and then while the world was viscously attacked, our country bumpkin leader sat with a bunch of kindergarten children and read a book about a happy goat.\nI sum up Moore's early moments with much scarsam. Because I consider myself a moderate republican. I think Clinton was corrupt, just like Reagan was corrupt, like Carter was corrupt, and so on. I like George Bush as a president; I even for the most part understand the war in Iraq. Do I think it was necessary? Well no. But I do understand that before 9/11 every Democrat would hold Iraq over the Republican Party as the unfinished war. I remember countless arguments with friends saying ""how come we didn't get Saddam out of power?"" Do I also think that in the long run, 20 years from now Iraq will be a in better place? Yes. Do I have my problems with the Bush administration? Absolutely, yes!\nAfter all those questions I guess your probably asking? Did you like the movie? I whole heartily did. Just like I liked Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me, and even The Big One. Fahrenheit 9/11 is moving, brilliantly cut together, and Moore's narration is sharp. No matter what anybody has to say about this film, you can't argue that this movie is compelling. Even if it's one giant fabrication, or a giant piece of propaganda, which I myself am not about to agree with or disagree with. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a well made, powerfully moving film, and does what every documentary strives do, it gets people talking.\nThe movie makes you laugh, It horrifies you, it makes you cry, and it stirs a sense of social justice that I think is vital in this day and age. Sure, I could probably write a book about the holes in Moore's logic (I'm still convinced some speech or debate class in high school should look at everyone of his movies and count the number of argumentative fallacy's he breaks) but on the merits of a movie, you can't argue with how well made it is.\nMichael Moore has always had a keen sense of social justice that I loved. He tries to look out for the little guy. Many of the people he talks to are composites of you and me. I loved the little old lady who talks about Halliburton near the middle of the film. That little old women is the voice of the masses I think. She doesn't have that many facts, but she sure is passionate with the scraps of knowledge she's gleamed from CNN or Katie Couric.\nMy qualms with the film are three- fold. The biggest is Moore's shaky creditability. Lets face it, the guy has been making things up since Roger and Me. Every one of his films has walked the line from creative retelling to outright lie. It taints every idea in the film. It makes a moderate voice like mine very skeptical. Unfortunately I haven't done the research to oppose his ideas, but at least I can distance myself from them while I watch.\nMy other problem is that Moore lays things on a bit too thick as the film progresses. Things go from bleak to worse, as an American I was grasping for something. Near the end of the film I just wanted a solution, a suggestion, even a small iota of hope. Moore presents us with such a bleak picture. He asks probing questions, but you're left feeling like ""what the heck can I do."" Except succumb to the fact that Michael Moore is better person that I am. This is why I like what Solomon wrote and the second quote above. In the end it's all vanity. It all passes away. One day were fighting Iraq, the next there are allies in our ongoing war with some other country that ticks us off. People are fallen and evil at their core. It's why we don't get along. It why we cheat and steal, and the greatest man can be the world our biggest enemy.\nThirdly, was the way Moore portrayed Muslims. It seems the best way to get his point across that the Saudi's are bad is by placing ominous music over pictures of Bush and his father in photo-ops with men in turbins. He also uses silly silent movie clips to make the point that the coalition of nations is made up of the US and small inconsequatil countries with backwards ideas. While their may be truth in the comments, using broad stereotypes was not the smartest idea.\nAll in all Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11 is brilliant and bold. But will it sway voters? Probably not. This is a movie for those who agree with Moore, I don't think I will swing to many others. I would recommend anyone give it a try. You might just leave with a few ideas in your head and that's never a bad thing.\n***** Out of 5";Brilliant and Watchable

1377;1011.0;5.0;12.0;"I was already deeply depressed at the abhorrent behavior of my own country since our current administration was s(elected) into office. The attacks of September 11th were horrible enough for the destruction and loss of life that it caused. Our hero Michael Moore's follow-up to his controversial documentary ""Bowling For Columbine"" is the most powerful, not to mention the most awakening documentary that I've ever seen by anyone. (CAUTION: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)\n Where the last one was focusing on our obsession with guns and trying to peer into the reason why America has such a high rate of gun violence, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an outrageous and not to mention deeply frightening look at how Washington D.C. used the attacks of 9/11 to push it's own political agenda and the alliances between the Bush and The Bin Laden families and how dirty deals between the families caused Bush and Osama to become mortal enemies. We see many things where the ties between the oil companies that Bush and Cheney have played a significant part and the Saudi Arabian government officials and the many Bin Laden relatives who worked and lived in the United States and that the administration allowed to flee almost immediately after the attacks in NYC and D.C. You won't believe what this area will show to you. Be warned though: You will be very angry when you are done seeing this part wherever you lie on the political spectrum.\n I always was certain that the war in Iraq was motivated by our countries excessive thirst for petroleum and how Iraq is the world's second largest source of petroleum and that oil companies have been given contracts to rebuild the country for it's oil but this movie goes even farther and the things I saw just made me so incredible guilty especially for how our countries oil addiction has been one of the main causes of many of the wars we've fought in the Middle East. Being aware of this, I have chosen not to own a car just so I don't support Halliburton (The company that vice president Dick Cheney was head of) or other corporate creeps. The pictures of the many Iraqi children playing basketball, on playgrounds, laughing and reading with their parents and relatives immediately followed by the balls of fire and bombs going off and the aftermath made me cry in horror at the resulting suffering that has resulted from our administrations illegal war. Many of the Iraqi's even though they hated Saddam Hussein were infuriated at our countries unlawful attack against a country that had little if any capability to attack it's neighboring countries.\nAlso a lot of things that really shocked and horrified me that this documentary showed was how the government would recruit soldiers for the war in Iraq, not from the well-to-do neighborhoods but would recruit them from a lot of the poor and ghetto neighborhoods like many areas in Flint, Michigan, Moore's hometown where his 1989 ""Roger and Me"" was filmed at, and many other run-down areas. Many of the poorer neighborhoods where the soldiers were recruited from, were made even poorer as a result of the administration's policies.\n I was always very scared of what has been happening in the political world but even then, this really shocked me and left me really teed off big time! Okay, maybe some of the things emphasized may or may not be exaggerated but this is the best example of why we need to wake up and realize what Washington is doing and how their dangerous and murderous policies are causing the deaths of thousands or even millions of lives and ruining countless millions more.\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is also smartly done and even goes the distance to take some swipes at the Democratic Party and how a lot of the members of that party really dropped the ball on the 2000 Election and that they just sat back and admitted defeat when they could easily have prevented the disaster that America has been both subjected to and causing to it's population and against other countries. This is sure to cause more controversy just like ""Bowling For Columbine"" did but this is one of the most honest and heartbreaking, not to mention powerful documentaries of all time and if you really do care for America and for the international community then you must see this right away because it will make you want to make a difference and try to make our world a much better place than it is now.\n While this is extremely serious in it's tone, there are parts of this documentary that are really funny and smartly incorporate humor into the movie to bring some laughs without taking away it's important tone. One part will make your stomach turn in three hundred and sixty turns.\n For all of those who are criticizing or bashing Moore for `liberal-propaganda' or dribble like that, do you even know what liberal or conservative mean? Neither liberal nor true conservative would've been waging this horrific war in Iraq, nor support frauds who have ruined so many lives and the future of so many more around the world. I for one am offended and appalled at the American attitude towards the international community and that seeing this documentary has made me realize just how low we as a nation have gone but that at the same time, we can turn this whole thing around and realize how our politicians have been screwing us over a hundred times due to their self-interest and murderous greed. I give my complete gratitude to Mr. Moore for helping to blow the whistle on the epic corruption of our leaders in Washington and for awakening us up to the dangers of them.\nGo and see this today! If you are a true patriot, then you must vote for new leaders who care for the people and not the special interests of greedy businessmen or oil companies.";Extremely important and shocking!

Our military has done a great job under extreme conditions.  I hope they will someday trust again after being lied to as to the reason for the war.  This is a must see if you value our freedom of speech and wonder how bad things are in Washington right now.;Bush was not honest about Iraq

1435;1015.0;5.0;12.0;"I was stunned to learn of the cozy relationship the Bush Dynasty has with the Saudis. The Bin Laden family claims to have shunned Osama and yet the aftermath of 9/11 continues to funnel millions of dollars into the family coffers.\nSome critics have complained that Michael Moore selectively shows footage of Baghad pre-""Shock and Awe"" featuring children at play, etc. Those same critics are missing the point. Iraqis are people just like we are. They have homes, families, loved ones. Judging all Iraqis to be the same as Saddam Hussein is narrow-minded bigotry. Whereas Faux News showed us a sterile bombing campaign and Administration assurances that civilian deaths were at a minimum, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" shows us instead grief-stricken Iraqis burying their dead and bellowing rage at the United States.\nAn incredibly powerful and disturbing film. Every patriotic American needs to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and learn the truth.";Eyes Wide Open!!!

Since then, we are divided between half that feels trapped in a nightmare and perhaps half that feels challenged by a holy war. This movie telescopes the shared American experience of the last 3 years into a painfully honest yet healing, masterful film.\nIf you're on the left, go see it because it helps to put a context around the pain that you have been feeling, and there are interesting details throughout.\nIf you're on the right and find yourself angry at friends and relatives that disagree with you or seem unpatriotic or don't seem to understand that we were attacked and that 9-11 changed everything, invest 2 hours and go see it. It will take you back to that day when we were all Americans, and let you see what the last 3 years have been like for those who ended up on the other road. Maybe it will help us heal as a nation.\nNo matter who you are, go see it because it's a really fine and engrossing film.;Laughter to lighten, catharsis for our shared grief
119;1018.0;1.0;11.0;This is a horrible movie. As an American Moore should have more respect for the man that represents our nation.

I whatched about 30 minutes of the film and walked out, not because I support Bush(which I was nuetral about in the election) but because it is terrible and unamerican to do to our president. Just because you don't like him doesn't mean a movie should be made. Moore should had thought twice about making this film.;Should be illegal.
123;1019.0;5.0;11.0;"Thanks goodness someone out there is brave enough to question the incredible hijacking of this country by this Hitler-like regime. It is incredible the lengths this administration has gone to in an attempt to justify it's manipulation of America and the rest of the world. The ""Right"" (which has grown to be synonymous with Christian fundamentalists, thanks to their complete annihilation of the boundary between church and state) wanted to hang Clinton for such things as having tried marijuana or having an affair (which happened to be a personal matter, completely unrelated to his job performance), yet Bush had a long and well-known addiction to Cocaine, womanizing, alcoholism, etc. Such behavior makes Clinton's antics look like a tea party by comparison. But that same party feels that Bushs' indiscretions are acceptable now that their man is up. Often characteristic of the Christian Right hypocrisy.\n\nIn addition, we have terrorists that have entered, and will continue to enter our country to seek revenge on our soil as long as we continue to unfairly bully, discredit and ignore their and others concerns, especially in regards to how such groups/countries are treated by the USA. So the longer we drone on with this ""war on terrorism,"" the more people we anger in the world. If not due to our direct attacks on them/their country, certainly our negligence of their plight or our complete disregard for their concerns about our actions (or lack of, in some cases) will undoubtedly leave a wound sufficient to fuel some long term hostility. If we haven't angered enough people directly in the war, we've angered them indirectly with our arrogant, self-righteous, entitlement perpetrated by this administration to justify our mistreatment or abandonment of people/countries harboring both our allies and enemies.\n\nWith all of the anger and disdain the Bush administration has single-handedly warranted towards our country, the potential for us to be targeted for terrorism has risen exponentially. Since we live in a free country, it is extremely difficult to prevent those that seek to harm us from entering our country, this has been modeled numorously. The degredation of our global citizenship, the greater the desire to harm us. Bush has not fought a war on terrorism; he has positively ensured the future of disastrous and destructive terrorism, both domestically and internationally. This will be targeted towards both us and our allies, worst of all far too many innocent people.\n\nThe Administration has no regard for those men and women and their families that are so selflessly offering themselves up to execute his evil agenda. After all, it's not his family over there on the front lines. His behavior has been worthy of impeachment more than all who came before him. From his slow, basically non-existent response to Katrina and his dumbfounded stall to the news that our Country was under attack to his insistence on chasing down and threatening anyone that doesn't agree with him. Particularly if we are going to take into account his alcoholism, cocaine addiction and womanizing among other things. He actually infiltrated a group of 10 anti-war protestors in one small town. Do we not have bigger fish to fry as a nation, than him using his time, energy and our money to track down every group or individual who disagrees with him. Or rally congress to ensure that two people that love each other can NEVER (via constitutional amendment) be allowed to marry? Is this truly the best use of the leader of the free world's efforts? When you go over the short list of top priority concerns for this great Nation and beyond, gay marriage is right up on the top. Gee, I can think of about a thousand things I'd be so much more concerned about, like our rates of homelessness, abused and neglected children, the many millions that go to sleep each night hungry in this world, illiteracy, poverty, unemployment, uninsured populations, crime and gang ridden cities, FOREIGN RELATIONS, the economy, our budget deficit, our Social Security System, to name a few.\n\nNot to mention his endless insistence that otherwise discarded stem-cells cannot be used to save millions of lives because they are a form of life and therefore should be held sacred as one would treat any other human life. Human life sacred!! What about the human lives he is over desecrating daily in Iraq, on both sides? Oh, so human life is only sacred if it's human stem-cells on American soil? Who cares about any other form of human life or how many will lose their lives because of his not supporting stem-cell research. Those lives are not important. So apparently human life is only important in certain situations and applies to only certain humans. Like if you're Iraqi, your life is not sacred and therefore we will kill you. Thousands of Iraqi civilians have died or been cruelly and inappropriately detained as a result of our ""war on terrorism."" But save those stem-cells, by god they fall under the sanctity of human life. What so many of his followers don't understand is that as busy as he is off bullying other Countries, he is simultaneously at home, quietly and not-so-quietly sticking it to the American public as well. So thank you, Michael Moore. Though because your documentary was created a few years ago, you had no way of knowing all of the follow-up material that would be available for a sequel by this day and age, and imagine the possibilities we still have 2 years to go. Wake up America! When are we going to put the skids on this out-of-control drunken frat boy, whom so eloquently demonstrates the old adage ""it's not what you know, but who you know."" For Mr. Bush and his supporters I have one question (actually many), but with your sanctity on human life, could you just explain to me who Jesus would bomb?";Thanks for your courage, Michael Moore!
130;1020.0;5.0;11.0;This film is right on point.  No wonder it has won so many accolades and foreign and national film awards.  The film chronicles how Mr. Rove and company seized power in the United States in 2000 with their figurehead president: George Bush.  Mr. Bush, a failure at all he touches, not to mention his cowardice shown while hiding out in the National Guard during Vietnam.  Of course clear and convincing evidence has shown that Mr. Bush did not complete his required service in the Air National Guard, even though he was in a safe stateside slot.\n\nThe film also shows the heartfelt sadness of a mother who lost her son in Iraq.  Complete with a scene of a foolish Bush apologist in Washington, DC trying to persuade the woman who had lost a son that another woman protesting the war was not for real.\n\nThe film, of course, portends the change in American values set forth by the Bush administration, and their legions of self-serving cronies, apologists, and dupes.  The film also shows how the groundwork was laid for the United Sates to cast off the honorable goals of its framers to become a government of dishonor, torturers, liars, dupes for cash, dupes for free, and arrogant popinjays that thumb their noses at the Constitution, Congress, the courts, and of course the people of the United States.  Further, the film shows how the Bush administration has used 9/11 for constant political gain, and the justification for all manner of questionable and illegal activities by the Bush cabal.\n\nWe now know that the Bush administration has condoned and committed torture on human beings, unlawful renditions, illegal wiretapping on American citizens, and an ongoing list of desecrations to the Constitution.\n\nThey who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty or security.  -- Benjamin Franklin;Truth in Government

It doesn't aim to present ""the facts"" and let you decide for yourself - that's what the news is for (unless you're watching Fox). Rather, it's taking a particular view of certain facts and expressing it with maximum emotion. This is seen by some reviewers as unfair or somehow inappropriate in a feature film only because it happens so rarely in that medium. Not so in others. When the likes of Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly spew their conservative vitriol all over radio, television and print - or when Gore Vidal does the same for the liberals - nobody seriously accuses them of being ""biased"" for the simple reason that nobody expects to hear a list of facts. We expect to hear an argument, and that's what we get. They're arguing about policy and ideology from passionately held positions. That is precisely what Moore is doing here, no more and no less. As a fair and even-handed ""documentary"" it deserves 1 star. As a feature-length essay, it's highly effective. Love it or hate it, this kind of thing is essential in a democracy, and unavoidable.

Dissent is an act of courage and responsible citizenship, not treason.  Furthermore, the exercise of our constitutional right to free speech is one of the most American activities a person can engage in. The accusation of ""treason"" by some of these reviewers reminds me of events during WWI, when many American citizens were held as prisoners of conscience, sentenced to years in prison because they dared to speak out against the war.  Eugene V. Debs was one such prisoner, sentenced to 10 years in  federal prison for giving a speech in which he criticized U.S. involvement in WWI. You can read this Canton, Ohio speech for yourself in _Eugene V. Debs Speaks_ by Jean Y. Tussey if you would like to know what the government was labeling sedition at that time. The Sedition Act prohibited any ""profane or abusive language"" against the United States government. No matter whether you're a liberal or a conservative, let's agree that we should not return to those days when in this supposedly free country a person could be imprisoned for stating his beliefs.

The first time, I left when Moore not only implied, but flat out stated that all Republicans and Conservitives (by which he means anybody who does not think exactly like he does) are racist and malicious.  It became abundantly clear that Moore was in no way interested in saying anything worth hearing.  Eventualy, however, through pure force of will, I managed to sit through the entire thing, much to my chargin.  The rest of the movie was, in my opinion, no better than the first few minutes.\n\nTo say that Moore plays fast and loose with the facts (as we have already seen him do with his many other films and books including his Academy Award Winning ""Bowling for Columbine"") is obvious and, most likely, besides the point: all documentaries do fudge the facts, if only a little bit.  They all of them present selected and carefully culled facts to emphasize the point they are trying to make and minimize legitimate criticism.  Moore, though, turns what is often a fine tool into a blunt instrument, clubbing viciously at opposing viewpoints and even more viciously at those that hold those viewpoints.  In fact, it seems that the target of Moore's ire is not the view, but the person, which is a major blow against his credibility as we can hear very distinctly the sound of Moore's very large axe being ground.\n\nThe hostile atmosphere and vague, often incorrect, ""facts"" of this film create the overal impression that Moore is doing nothing but preaching to an already shrill quire and, perhaps, attempting to affect national politics in his own, blunt and obvious way.\n\nIf you're looking for reinforcement of preconceived notions and a hearty pat on the back, this is a film for you.

Yet I was willing to go see it if it showed footage from the war in Iraq that I could not find in the mainstream media.  The movie does have genuine clips of Iraqi civilians who were bombed, and for this reason alone it should be seen.  The palpable grief of Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, is also moving, as is the grief of all mothers who lose children, whether in necessary or unnecessary wars.  But after that, the virtues of the movie diminish and start to be overshadowed by its problems.  Sticking just to the question of war footage, Moore himself seemed to imply before the movie's release that he had footage of Iraqi prisoner abuse older than the Abu Ghraib photos, yet there is nothing so raw and clear as that in the movie.  There is only a scene cut and presented in such a way as to imply sexual abuse, when actually the footage may be about something quite different.\n\nDave Kopel's online essay, ""59 Deceits in Fahrenheit 911"", describes how problematic Moore's style really is.  ""59 Deceits"" has its own problems, but it provides links to other pieces defending Moore's movie, and to critiques of Kopel's own piece, including point-by-point rebuttals.  Having compared Kopel with his critics, I would invite other fans or critics of the movie to decide who does a better job of transcending their own problems, for instance by inviting the opposite side to respond and not merely dismissing their views.  I find it significant that Kopel does invite Moore to respond, and this should be no surprise, since Kopel is a lifelong Democrat who, like Moore, supported Ralph Nader in 2000.\n\nIt's impossible to see this film and not be moved by the suffering depicted in the U.S. and Iraq.  It's also practically impossible, unless you hold Michael Moore's political views, not to feel infuriated that such suffering should be presented in a movie that was openly made for political purposes.  In short, if you agree with those purposes, you won't feel manipulated, but if you disagree in any way with Moore's politics, you'll feel manipulated toward his views, rather than genuinely persuaded.  Considering that the American public was largely manipulated into supporting the invasion of Iraq, a movie like this hardly leaves you hopeful.\n\nBut manipulative politics is not the chief problem with the film.  I find some things in Moore's political worldview attractive, especially when Fahrenheit is shining a light on problems at home, and drawing attention to how those problems might be linked to war.  The greater problem for me while watching the movie was not that I was listening to someone with radical politics, but instead a feeling that certain facts or realities - and yes, certain sufferings - were being systematically kept from me, as if I could not be trusted to make up my own mind.  Michael Moore has written that Americans are essentially stupid:  ""Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet....in thrall to conniving, thieving, smug pricks.  We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. We don't know about anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing.""  Not that Fahrenheit 911 cares to show us anything about what it's like to live in foreign countries such as Afghanistan or Iraq.  The movie assiduously avoids trying to educate us about life beyond our borders, besides showing us sweet scenes of everyday life that go down easily.  No doubt Moore feels that Saddam Hussein's police state was already highlighted enough by the mainstream media, and that his job as a film-maker was to point out the dark side of American involvement.  But in this way, his movie unwittingly argues that the mainstream media is doing a good job, or at least a passable job, of educating Americans about Iraq.  It clearly is not.  The Bush administration may have rightly called attention to certain living situations far beyond our imagination in our democracy, but neither Moore nor I would assert that the White House has fairly educated us about what Iraqi society was like before American intervention.  If that's a problem, and Moore says our ignorance is a problem, you'd expect Moore to try to address it.  No attempt is made.  Perhaps he doesn't trust us to make up our own minds.  Maybe he thinks Americans have been kept fully in the dark about their negative impact on other countries and cannot be trusted to hear anything else right now, even if hearing other things would help make an emotional connection between Americans and Iraqis.  Perhaps he doesn't feel the oppression in Iraq was really something worth looking at right now.  Any of these attitudes is a serious problem, and would be in any individual.  All the more is that true for someone who calls his films documentaries, and who does call in his films for compassion.\n\nAnd there are many inconsistencies here.  Fahrenheit is very respectful towards the horror of the 9-11 attacks, but it uses the attack on the Pentagon as a sight gag, despite the fact that a third of the people who died were civilians on an airplane.  He has said this about the Lila Lipscombs of our country: ""I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end.""  Finally, Moore has publicly excoriated U.S. support of Israel, yet he says nothing about Israel in Fahrenheit, presumably because he did not want to lose the large Jewish vote on the left when it came time to unseat Bush.  No doubt, too, since he wants to paint U.S. foreign policy as being in Saudi Arabia's pocket, he doesn't want to analyze how that nation, besides rarely agreeing with Israel on anything, actually opposed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Nevertheless, it's a strange issue to omit, because U.S. support for Israel is widely reviled in the Middle East; it's something that Americans do need to look at; and talking about it would be a great way to indict Bush.  Moore attacks Bush, his personality and his politics, in every possible way, but says nothing about Israel, a country right at the heart of Middle East violence.\n\nAs noted, both fans and critics agree that the movie is not objective.  Fans of Fahrenheit 911, and even some critics, often say that it wasn't meant to be ""that kind of movie.""  The fans say that it was meant to show the side of things which runs against the mainstream, and if it doesn't attempt anything else, so what?  But then why call it a documentary?  If a movie known as a documentary raises questions about whether, for instance, the film-maker is playing fast and loose with the documents or the material he is trying to document, then the movie is ""that kind of movie.""  Any movie purporting to be factual is going to call up such questions as whether facts were documented and presented in context, and whether there was misleading or deceit going on.  So why is the movie's lack of objectivity said to be a non-issue?  That attitude is a serious problem.  What it really says is that the question of deception is not so important as the question of who will sit in the White House, or in this case, the objective of unseating Bush.  The lesson being taught here, whether fans of the movie are aware of it or not, is that truth is not so important as political victory.  I am fully convinced that this is the attitude that got us into war in the first place, and is no way to avoid future wars.\n\nMichael Moore is a dragon-slayer, not in the traditional sense of someone who might actually be doing something good, but in the contemporary sense of someone who is willing to deceive (by careful selection and omission) in order to get his man.";Michael Moore, dragon-slayer
272;1032.0;2.0;11.0;"I give ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" two stars because it was edited well, and I always find Michael Moore amusing.  I was a huge fan of Moore's ""TV Nation"" program back in the '90's.\n\nLet me speak freely, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a work of propaganda.  Some folks cringe when they hear the word, ""propaganda.""  It's not a bad word.  The third ed. of THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE defines propaganda as: ""The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.""  Moore's detractors use the term ""propaganda"" constantly to discredit him.  Moore's supporters are afraid of using the term, although it accurately reflects what his film is.\n\nMoore's film holds a mirror up to its audience.  Those of the left who wish to see the work as a factual account of the wrongdoings of the Bush administration will see this reflected in the work.  Those on the right who wish to see this film as an unfactual account concocted to knock a sitting president will see this.\n\nMy biggest concern about the film is the lack of critical thinking amongst its audience.  News departments around the country were interviewing scores of audience members who had just left the theatre after seeing the film. There werwe so many who said they were going to change their vote because of the movie.  Many said that the film finally showed the truth about the Bush presidency.  Anyone who changes their vote or declares a propaganda film has just altered their interpretation of the truth worries me.  How many Germans were swayed to accept the anti-semitic ""truth"" of the Nazi party back in the '40's when ""Jud Suss"" was released?\n\nOur nation urgently needs to be critical of propagandistic films.  After watching ""Fahyrenheit 9/11"" my first impulse was to run to the library to do some serious fact-checking.  It would be insane to think that this film is entirely factually accurate.  Moore is a muckraker, and thank God there are muckrakers on both ends of the political spectrum.  Would Moore be more forthcoming with his sources or his editing techniques if watchdogs on the right weren't putting his feet to the fire?\n\nWatch ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" for the amusement value.  Moore is a funny guy.  I cracked up when I saw the ""idyllic"" scenes of pre-invasion Iraq.  Whatever you do, viewer, please, PLEASE view Moore's films CRITICALLY.  Do not believe every single event in them.  Go to the library, do some fact-checking, after you watch a propaganda film from either the left or right.  Don't tell the hometown reporter that you're going to change your vote.  Don't be stupid- DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!";Amusing, but annoying...

His mocking of 9/11 and our men and women in uniform is disgusting and disrespectful.  I urge anyone not enlightened into the whole political scene to not watch this movie, as it will give you the absolute wrong idea about our soldiers, our country, and our great leader George W Bush.

Of course it was made to represent Michael's point of view, but that can't take away from that fact that nothing in this film is a lie.\n\nThis is indeed a shocking film, and includes very graphic scenes of war.

Most of the facts here are shown as actual video clips or newspaper articles, very little is actually just someone telling you something.

If you don't bekeive this, you better start reading your history book.  Most kids fighting are poor kids who had no better options.  This movie cast great respect and sympathy toward the poor who are econimocally forced into the military to fight our wars.  I know many join because they are patriots, but many see this as their only choice.  My family has lost 3 to war.  I feel for those fighting or waiting for their return.  I beleive this type of corruption is within both parties and we need to take our country back from the rich elite businesses that create most of our policy.

It means that some southerners couldn't get their head on straight and now, we are stuck with this president for another miserable four years. The east coast gets the picture. New York gets the picture. Pennsylvania gets the picture. Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire gets the picture. Even our own capital of D.C. wants this terrible president and ignorant human being OUT OF OFFICE. But before this chaos ensued, Michael Moore made Fahrenheit 9/11, a thoughtful documentary showing the people that couldn't already figure it out who W really is. He wants to please his daddy. He wants presidential fame. All he's doing right now is making a mess of things, and Moore showed us all Bush's treachery. Some people just can't figure themself out, and those people make up half the union. Basically, America, you made the wrong choice in 2004. You screwed up real bad. And you WILL pay. This powerful documentary only further proves my point. Senator Kerry, I support you, and your motives. You were my unanimous choice for president, along with millions of others who wanted you.

When Mike Moore does a film, he always starts with a very good beginning. As the film progresses, we see all that we thought had happened, but never really confirmed. Yes, Bush did actually take a vacation the first days in office, I actually have the taped news report from 2000, and no, it definatly wasn't FOX. With the progression of the film we also bear whitness to alot of opinions from a wide variety of people, the most compelling to me, was the homless woman, screaming at the white house, one of those moments. Also, another thing that was brought to our knowlege is that, however ""Brave"" our solders are...They are mostly men. and alot of those men joined the army as some gung-ho fancey. Now don't get me wrong, some of our troops have joined for noble causes, but there are those few, racist, wicked men, who just want to shoot some muslims, either because of the sterio-type that all muslims are terrorists, or due to religious belief. Now, in many a review i have seen the terms ""Bucket of Lies""  ""No informational Value"" and ""Just a Bush-bashing Film with no sence of Truth"" I just want to say, This does have informational value, It ISNT complete lies, and there is some truth to what moore has said. Now, could this be a vendetta film? Perhaps..but if it is...its the best damn vendetta film i ever saw. The thing is...It is a very well made film, regarless of content. Somewhere in the middle of the film , we meet a very republican mother, whos very proud of her son whos over in Iraq. Then one day, he dies, and WHAM! her entire perspective changes, We see a group of solders in a tank, ready to bombard a city, and of all the songs they can play, the listen to "" Let the Mother F**kers burn"" We see what might have been, we see what could have been, and we see that as americans, we are only human.\n\nNow for the republican stand point:\n\nAs many of you put it: This was a pure anti-bush film. Mike Moore seems to hate almost everything, and you can tell. This movie was Bush-Bash after Bush Bash after Bush-Bash, and didn't even give republicans the benifit of the doubt. We see what could be proof of a vendetta when bush turns down Moore, in a confrence telling him to ""Get a life"" He probably should, but you have to admit: He's made it pretty good so far. Along with what seems to be vastly embellished truth, also, Moore always seems to want to put in vastly greusome pictures to proove his point. Another thing, I don't think anyone should bring polotics to the emmys, no matter what you opinion is, but moore seemed to deem it absolutly fit, so here you go. As far as alot of the material goes in the movie, it seems moore expects to change everyone's beliefs, but to be liberal, shouldn't you have to let people believe what they want to? Isnt that, like a rule or something? who knows, but one thing is certain, this movie has caused quite the ruccus, be that a bad thing or a good thing.\n\nTo end my review, I would like to call apon the Great Charlie Chaplin, to give us a word of advice, We ALL need.\n\n""The Great Dictator""\n\nWe all want to help one another, human beings are like that.\n\nWe all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.\n\nWe have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.\n\nWithout these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.\n\nThe aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".\n\nThe misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish...\n\nSoldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.\n\nDon't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.\n\nIn the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written "" the kingdom of God is within man "" - not one man, nor a group of men - but in all men - in you, the people.\n\nYou the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.\n\nSoldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!\n\nLook up! Look up! The clouds are lifting - the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.\n\nThe soul of man has been given wings - and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow - into the light of hope - into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up.""";Come on! Its a movie by Moore!
1095;1060.0;4.0;11.0;I just saw F911 and had a severe occurence of deja vu.  This is just a recap of Dude Where's my Counrty.  I see what he's trying to do, but I don't think it will make a real difference.  People who hate Bush will watch this movie and it will cause them to hate bush even more.  The people on W's side either A. Won't watch it...or B. Watch it and pick out every bit of controversial information that M.Moore presents as fact.  Michael Moore is the democratic Rush Limbaugh.  He is extreme...he bends facts...presents theories as facts.....but at least he is on the side of good.  But seriously...is the antidote for a rich, self interest pandering, skull n' bones, silverspoonified white guy....a slightly taller, rich, self interest pandering, skull n' bones, silverspoonified white guy?  So Kerry will be more civil with France?!  Who cares?!  I hate all politicians...your vote doesn't matter!  If you like this ridiculous system of goverment then quit complaining!  It's going well for you.  If you hate this country like I do...then leave(I can't because I'm a felon).  Voting is pointless unless you live in a few select states.  And even then...it matters very little.  4 stars because I like the way Michael Moore conveys things and his humorous antics.  Anyone who says M. Moore is doing this for money is a fool.  He speaks from his heart and I believe he is a good man.;I've already read all this in his books?!
1096;1061.0;3.0;11.0;The film lacks any sense of visual style or sophistication.\n\nIt bludgens the viewer with the simplistic viewpoint of the\n\nfilm maker.\n\nToo much time spent on whiney crying people, no time spent\n\nat all showing the WTC falling, but the target audience enjoys wearing\n\nthe hair shirt, and has opted out of independent thought.\n\nFor real quality propaganda, Triumph of the Will is the\n\ngold standard against which all propaganda movies must\n\nbe judged, and 9/11 falls sadly short.;Not the best propaganda, but adequate for the susceptible.
1097;1062.0;5.0;11.0;I am thankful that we live in America, where someone like Mr. Moore can make a movie like Fahrenheit 9/11 without fear of government reprisal or (overt) censorship. I am a Michael Moore fan so went into this movie expecting it to be good. It was that and more. Anyone seeing this movie will come away with, at the least, a few questions that need answering. I have heard many people saying that this is a horrible movie. The majority of them have not seen it. Do yourself a favor and go see it before you talk about it. It you still think it's bad, well that's an informed opinion and one I can respect. The thing which impressed me about Fahrenheit 9/11 is that Michael Moore is very clear that while he does not in any way support the Bush presidency or the administration war machine, he also has tremendous respect for the young men and women who have chosen the military as a way of serving our country. I have rarely seen this expressed so effectively. As an african-american woman, the most heart breaking moments for me were the senate hearing regarding the election of GWB when the voices of many african americans were heard protesting the election results and each time Al Gore asked if they had the signature of one U.S. Senator.  Not a single senator out of 100 could be found to support the resolutions. Why did we not know that these hearings were happening? Where was the U.S. Senate when people were clearly asking for help? For Shame! I won't even go into the questionable financial issues which are raised in this film. Go see this movie with someone who you don't agree with politically. Have discussions about it and the issues it raises. Debate and discuss and then in November go and vote your conscience.;God Bless America
1165;1063.0;4.0;11.0;"""Fahrenheit 911"" has generated unprecedented interest and controversy---just look at the number of amazon reviews, and it will be quite awhile before the DVD is released!\n\n Even as a member of the ""choir"" to whom the movie was supposedly preaching, I dragged my feet about going to see it. I thought that Moore, known for his ""pouring it on"" , sometimes to the point of absurdity, might do our cause more harm than good.\n\n This is not the case. In this movie, Moore has restrained himself from exuberant, ""over the top"" claims and attitudes, and presented us with a work that, although it has its light moments and even some hilarity, will make the audience soberly ponder the path of our current administration.\n\n My sole criticism is Moore's voice-over during the footage of Bush, at the Florida elementary school, hearing about the attacks. Moore speculates that Bush may be thinking of his family's business involvements with the Bin Ladens, and other connections to the international oil scene. I think that Moore is giving Bush far too much credit! The man does look stricken, frozen even, but it's probably because he is waiting for someone to tell him what to do. Where are his advisors when he needs them? Such a crisis is far beyond the man's abilities to comprehend and deal with alone, and he knows it.";"Not as ""over the top"" as other Moore productions"
1169;1064.0;5.0;11.0;"Its to bad that certain folks who condemn this movie as a pack of lies, have NEVER seen it. They are also the first ones who whined about the Reagan movie and got it censored to the cable channel. They call Moore Un-American and a liar, yet offer no PROOF to their assertions. If it were truly a pack of lies, EDUCATED folks should be able to see right thru it, and demand their money back, but so far I haven't heard of ONE person do that yet. The online blogs have been trumpeting the FACTS in Moores movie ever since 9/11. Its ALL in the Public Domain. Most Americans haven't seen this stuff because the lazy, corporate whores in the mainstream media haven't done their jobs. Like Moore has stated, they jumped on the War bandwagon, kissed the Presidents butt, and NEVER asked the tough questions of this Administration. Proof positive that the ""Media"" is far from librul. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Dissent is the HIGHEST form of Patriotism"", and as an American, or as a person who seeks the TRUTH, you OWE it to yourself to see this movie....then Dissent is up to you. See you in November.";Tells it like it is.
1187;1065.0;1.0;11.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a movie, nor is it a documentary. It is a tediously long political ad posing as a movie. It is 100% a 'Bush bashing', obviously designed to aid the Democratic party in regaining the White House. As a registered voter who votes for the person and the platform, not for the party, I am thoroughly disgusted with this blatant effort to depict our President as a conniving, evil person who, according to this political ad, premeditated the attack against the United States; provided no aid whatsoever to the survivors of those killed; premeditated the war in Afghanistan; and now the war in Iraq.  According to Fahrenheit 9/11, he did all thisfor money (as if he needed any). I am sickened to know that many thousands of voters in this country, who vote based on emotion, good looks, charisma, etc., will take the infomation contained in this political ad as totally factual, without even questioning the veracity of the information presented. Incidentally... I would like to know who paid the bill for the research the 'movie maker' did, as well as the costs involved in obtaining the various news clips, both public and private, and the production of the so-called movie.  Could it have been the Democratic party???\n\nIn ending I would just like to say this:\n\nThe Democratic Party must not feel very confident that the inept candidate they have put forward for the office of President Of The United States is capable of carrying the election.\n\nWhat other possible reason could there be for such a disgusting political ad as Fahrenheit 9/11????";Blatant Abuse Of Entertainment Media
1191;1066.0;1.0;11.0;"Let's face it! All liberals originated in France. I find it ironic that someone like Michael Moore calls his movie a fact. Prove it, Michael, and don't give me that liberal crap! We all know you liberals believe that family values mean ""Big Brother in Washington"" and that you supported both Carter's and Clinton's nominations of ""too soft on crime"" judges to the Federal Supreme Court, circuit courts and district courts.\n\n Liberals have their own versions of words, especially when it comes to the words lie and truth. The word lie to a liberal is any subject that exposes the ""actual truth"" of the liberal agenda. They are afraid of this and don't want people to hear, because they know they're wrong. The word ""truth"" to them is anything that is concocted to meet the criteria of their belief system. Notice how the mainstream press protects anyone on the left these days? NBC, CBS, ABC and especially CNN does it, and it's done in such a clever way.\n\n This movie is more like fiction than it is a documentary, it cannot be proven since this is only through the eyes of a bleeding-heart liberal. This is just out of desperation to bring back the political gain of those politicians Moore hates the least, and it's through this bogus movie he made in order to dupe voters into voting for any of the candidates he supports.";Because Liberals Are DESPERATE!!!

1252;1068.0;5.0;11.0;If anything I was expecting the film to be more biased and manipulative than it was, given the amount of negative publicity it has received from many film and media journalists.\nLike all of Moores works the film is explicit and unapologetic in its attempts to undermine, in this case Bush, and this is pertinent given the nature of the protean beast that Moore is dealing with.\nThe film does not meander like Bowling for Columbine did, and is more like a film than a documentary in the sense that it is highly structured and deliberate. The most important aspect of this film is the heartbreaking footage it contains - if you hate Moore and can't see past this then your not going to appreciate it as he is usually present in either voiceover or person - however if the man himself does not offend you then you should find yourself saddened by much of what you see, and these images are REAL regardless of how they are montaged to persuade the viewer. For example Pre-war Iraq may not have been the quite the free and easy place Moore portrays it in this film yet the dead bodies we see are not staged, nor is suffering of humans in front of the camera - all of it directly tied in with the Bush policies.\nMoore shows us footage which should disturb, and while there may be violins playing in the background (literally) it is important footage which should be seen.;Should convert a few fence sitters at least
1278;1069.0;5.0;11.0;"No matter what your views on Moore or Bush this is a compelling, thought provoking look at the self-confessed 'war' President and his team. From Congress looking appalled at the idea of reading proposed bills before passing them ""Do you know how long that would take?"" to Bush not knowing how to react when he was given news of the first plane hitting the TT to the torment of parents whose children were killed in Iraq; Moore takes the audience on a rollercoaster ride of every emotion and reaction to the current situation in the USA. A MUST SEE.";Thought provoking

1346;1071.0;5.0;11.0;"I attended this movie in a traditionally conservative area, but the showing was sold out.  I was very surprised by the emotional force of the movie.  I read and heard professional and non-professional reviews and comments before seeing this movie.  I expected to see things that were dramatic, but with questionable interpretations.  I'm still waiting.\nMichael Moore does provide his commentary on the events and issues of Iraq and terrorism, but he presented facts, not fiction.  Fact:  Bush sat in the kindergarten chair for several minutes after being told that the country was under attack and did NOTHING.  Fact:  the Bin Laden family was whisked away with U.S. approval without proper questioning, while middle age citizens and groups are being infiltrated by government spies, or they are questioned by the FBI.  Fact:  the Patriot Act was rushed through Congress without it being read.  These and many more scenes are facts.  The administration gives alternative explanations for why all these things occurred, but they can't refute the facts.  By the way, why did it take this movie to give us the truth about Bush's sitting in the classroom for so long, then later have his people talk about how immediately he went into action?  Any of those kindergartners could have told him to get up and move.\nTo me, the most powerful scenes involve the pro-war lady from Michigan, who then loses her oldest son in Iraq.  Her pro-war comments were presented without interference from Moore, who interviewed her.  The camera then shows her reaction after she learned of her son's death and as she reads his last letter that his hostile to the war.  More disturbing is the scene of this poor lady as a woman in Washington tells her that her account of her son's death is fiction.  Only the coldest hearted of ""compassionate"" Republicans could fail to be moved by that scene and many others.  I too have a son in the military.  Please see this film before November.";A more important film has not been made.
1361;1072.0;5.0;11.0;I went to see this film with every intension of cutting it to pieces and discrediting Michael Moore.  I also do not support either political party but i do believe that stopping Sadam torture his people was a good thing but that's as far as i can go. If this film is true (of course it's also part of the fault that Clinton didn't do anything either)I have much discust for Bush.  To see our soldiers fighting and dying while Bush is entertaining was a deplorable act.  I was also amazed by how many of our US Milatary also don't like him and why none of this wasn't covered or shown on network TV.  It seems like both our media and political leaders are in bed together in this love/hate relationship.  Personally i do not vote anymore because no matter who you elect they are all crooks.  Things you see on TV never seem to be what really is happening in this world.  Which brings to me my next statement of Television.  I have pretty much STOPPED watching news programs because of lies from the media and our political leaders which is also why i don't vote.  I have also changed my religion which states in the Bible that we shouldn't get politically involved anyway. Our main stream church has their political agenda also which should not be.\nI'm glad i saw this film and i hope more people will see this. If this film affected me and like i stated i do no like Michael Moore but i give this man alot of credit for making this.  Thank you Michael Moore.;I wanted to hate it, but couldn't

Instead, Michael Moore has given us one of the most stirring call to arms I have ever seen. He shows us how useless in fighting back against the 9/11 terrorists were our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, how feeble and incompetent is our homeland security. In chilling detail he makes an indictment of how the Saud Royal family is in bed with both Osama bin Laden and American business, and his message could not be any clearer: we are 2-1/2 years late in invading Saudi Arabia, occupying Mecca, and installing an American-style democracy in that terrorist stronghold. We must go to war now! Thank you, Michael Moore, for opening up my eyes!\nMr. Moore, I am signing on to your holy crusade!;Michael Moore's Stirring Call to Arms!
1383;1074.0;5.0;11.0;i thought it was great. some people need to stop complaining about it. notice how those who dilike the movie feel the need to insult those who did. that's not nice. remember its a movie stop complaining about how you feel moore distorts the truth, since many think its garbage, stop taking it so seriously. i think this is moore best film to date and i love bowling for columbine. glad to see a lot of people are enjoying this movie.;best movie of the year
1395;1075.0;5.0;11.0;It appears that the nit picking of facts has begun. What the public doesn't realize is, the media is not nit picking the real facts Moore gives us about the causes for the war in Iraq. Why did we go to war? Oil. Did Iraq attack us? Nope. Were they responsible for 911? Not by a long shot. Did Bush IMPLY the Alqaeda, Iraq connection? Damn right he did. I don't see them discussing this on television. They mention a few things here and there and than label the whole film as a big fat lie. Did they mention how the ironically named, Patriot Act goes against every constitutional right we have? How they used fear to force every American to give up certain rights. Bush was four years of Fear and manipulation. Its time for his reign of terror to come to an end. Behind his moronic smile, is the mind of a war mongering money hungry murderer. Sending in our young men and women to die for no reason, is the same as murder.\nIf you are scared of the truth, you are truly UnAmerican.;Why are you so afraid of the truth?

The movie focuses on the evil dollar and corruption. Even if this movie was completely b.s. it doesn't take a genius to see that Bush is a greedy moron along with his dad, cousin, brother, and all the other stooges that support him. People are saying that Moore is lying or showing half-truths. Ok, go believe every word (...)Bush says. The great thing about this movie is that it shows scenes from say 2003 where Bush will say a lie, and then later on it will show a scene from say 2001 where he says the opposite. It is obvious who the liar is. When someone is president you desperately want to trust them because they are supposed to lead this country and display honesty. Sadly, just as a man says in the movie, you can't trust people you don't know and you can't trust people you know either.  People who rely on so-called ""hard-facts"" from the media need to understand that you should never believe anything you hear or see 100% unless you've seen it for yourself.

1410;1077.0;4.0;11.0;Michael Moore has created an important work.  It may be the first film ever made that has a direct influence on an American election and on the outcome of a war.  For that, Moore deserves respect as a filmmaker, whether you agree or disagree with his message.\nI was surprised that the movie revealed nothing that most of us haven't heard before. The beauty of this film is that it outlines a damning scenario with a singularity of vision that is so clear, no one can miss it or even misunderstand it. In some ways Farenheit 9/11 reminded me of a campaign commercial on steriods.  It put the opponent in the worst possible light, avoided any nuance, and rarely gave voice to the opposing view.  But so what?  All meaningful documentaries have a point of view.  Many people condemn this film as propaganda, but what they are really saying is that they don't agree with its point of view.  Personally, I think Moore went easier on Bush than he could have.  The other side can make its own movie.;Familiar Theories More Powerfully Presented than Ever Before
1431;1078.0;5.0;11.0;Plenty of folks feel this film is merely propaganda, but they have not been able to present any evidence that Moore's statements in the film are incorrect.\nThe film takes the viewer through a wide range of emotions--humor, sadness, frustration, even anger.  Moore never attacks our troops, but he does reveal what can happen to good kids put into a nightmarish situation, and we are forced to squirm in discomfort.\nMoore obviously cares deeply about our country, but not necessarily those in power.  Moore seems to believe that our country deserves better.\nThe ultra-rich will dismiss this film, but Moore's point about economic disparity cannot be dismissed easily.  Kids from poor towns enlist in the military and get paid a decent wage for getting shot at while protecting the business interests of corporations.  There's something wrong with that picture, and Moore isn't afraid to say so.;The Truth Isn't Propaganda
1434;1079.0;5.0;11.0;I went to the independent theater by my house and went to see this film with an open mind and, yes I did hate moore for Bowling for columbine for all the Propaganda he did and his lil' edits to prove his point.  But I must say he did a great job for moore....Hey people people people, atleast has the b*lls to do it.\nAnd yes Moore makes Bush look like a joke even though Bush was a joke as a president this whole time.\nIt also braught alot of laughs too.  Moore can use humor in his own ways which brings up some of the things he said about bush.\nBut towards the end is getts really sad and I won't say why you'll just have to see it and if you hate moore and wanna make insults of him and his wieght just to make your self happy THEN DON'T REVIEW THIS FILM.  I will admit I hated what he did to make his point in BFC.\nBut I will say this has got to be the most important film of the year....hell even EVER MADE!\nGo see this film.

1438;1080.0;5.0;11.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 is outstanding, well done, and compelling. Michael Moore did an excellent job of weaving the story together using mostly stuff we already know from the news. However, it was actually a rather mild treatment of president Bush, which was nice of Moore.;Outstanding - Well Done

Most of the people surrounding me have said they hated the film without even seeing it.  I think this shows how afraid Bush supporters are afraid of the truth.  There maybe some minor disputes about the film's accuracy, mostly from people who have yet to see this work.  But they perhaps are the same people who see Fox News as really being ""Fair and Balanced"".  I would urge everyone to see this and make up their own minds before condemning or praising it.  I have never seen an entire theater cheer at the end of a film until now.  And rightly so.  To those who call it unpatriotic, just think of how this country was born.  It was born by brave people questioning those in power.  If anything, this movie has restored my patriotism.  And I consider Michael Moore a great patriot.  But please, do not criticize this film until you have seen it.  That seems the most un-patriot and hypocritical action possible in a free society.";Great Film
103;1083.0;5.0;10.0;I saw this movie on the 4th of July it was a special screening in Ann Arbor MI. At this I not only saw an excellent documentary but the mother from flint who is in the movie was also there. Unlike one reviewer stated that she was somehow tricked by Moore, she spoke quite passionately about how she thinks that the war should have never taken place and specifically addressed the fact that people do come up to her and ask her about her part in the film and if she knew of Mr. Moore's agenda. She also said that she got the final say of what was included in the movie about her and her son's story. I felt that it was important that people knew this and did not get the wrong idea about that part of the movie.;clearing something up!
104;1084.0;5.0;10.0;Michael Moore has been called a traitor by conservatives for making this film, for them, anyone who questions Bush or his actions should be condemned or even jailed, as one reviewer suggested on this board.  Is it not an American's duty to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions?  If a president deceives the nation on such a grand scale as Bush has, is it not reasonable to call his fitness to serve into question?  Moore has been accused of hating America for recognizing the wrongs of our nation in films like Fahrenheit and his previous works.  By this logic, a parent who questions their child's wrong behavior and tries to convince them to correct it must be full of hatred towards their child.  Moore makes the films he does out of love for a nation that he hates to see being mislead, the young men and women unnecessarily being sent to die or be wounded, and the millions of hard workers in this nation being left behind while rich corporations make off like bandits.\n\nPeople have attacked the credibility of the film, yet give few, if any, specific examples of inaccuracies.  Every line of the film is backed up with sources that Moore has made available on his website and the companion book.  Even so, can anyone dispute the words coming out of Bush's mouth?  Did Moore hire the Tonight Show Bush look-alike to make Bush appear to say some of those ridiculous things?  Did he hire a talented makeup crew to make those Iraqi children look like their faces were scorched and limbs blown apart?  Did he hire a talented actress to give a convincing performance of a mother whose son was sent to his death in service to his country?  No, these are all real and unavoidable.\n\n This movie is a splash of cold water into the face of all Americans to wake up and realize the despicable campaign of fear and deception waged on this nation by the powers that be, to profit off the suffering and death of innocents and the sacrifice of our servicemen/women.  If America would care more about who occupies the Oval Office than who is the next American Idol, we wouldn't be stuck with this incompetent fool of a president, surrounded by his father's cronies calling the shots.  It's time for America to stand up and take our country back.;A Sobering and Galvanizing Wakeup Call

At the time it was released, I drove over 100 miles to see it (as it was sold out locally).\n\n  It's still a thought provoking movie. Looking at current events and what was depicted in the movie, it is interesting just how on the money Moore was with most of his conclusions. Bush DID start this war, an unjust war that we are still in (Congress never declared war, BTW).\n\n  The extras on the DVD are very good and brings some of the info in the movie up to date.

This production is one that ALL real Americans NEED to view a whole lot more than they need to worry about managing their 401K's (which will never pay off) or watching Saturday's or Sunday's or Monday night's big game or any of the other ridiculous distractions that the CFR and the Order of Skull & Bones et al have instituted to further line their already overstuffed pockets and simultaneously keep Americans from thinking for themselves; studying what's right and wrong in our nation, asking important questions, demanding answers, and taking appropriate action.\n\nMichael Moore is a genius!  If you truly love the America that our founding fathers created for us, this is one work you should definitely view.  Otherwise, I hope you love the idea of living in a nation controlled by fascists because that's what we have today and it's going to get worse; a lot worse unless we all wake up and take corrective action.\n\nIgnore the critics for once, and see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".";An Outstanding Work Masterfully Crafted
171;1088.0;3.0;10.0;Did George W. Bush allow his business relationships with the Bin Laden family to dictate American foreign policy?  Did he intentionally lie about the weapons of mass destruction being in Iraq?  Is the whole 9/11 response in Afghanistan and Iraq really an elaborate scheme of the President to create favorable business for his wealthy business acquaintences?  Is Bush in the pocket of Saudi investors?  And the bottom line question:  is the current war in Iraq without purpose?\n\nThose inclined to distrust Bush will love this work, and grant a quick five stars for its collage of facts, emotions, and righteous indignation, combined with winning sarcasm.  The few remaining neo-conservative partisans will trash this as a psuedo-documentary that traffics in wild conspiracy theories, and which treats with childish disrespect a very serious war and terrorist threat.  Furthermore, they will decry as unfair this very deliberate hatchet job on Bush.\n\nMy own bias is that Bush went into Iraq hoping to plant a beach head for democracy in the Middle East.  The war has proven far deadlier and muckier than expected, but hopefully a stable government can still be erected in that suffering land.\n\nAs for this work, it is decent.  As a propaganda piece, the war mom's conversion was powerful, and impossible to ignore--probably the highlight of the show.  On the other hand, even with this winning segment, I constantly felt that Moore was using everyone he encountered.  Additionally, some of the scenes were sophomoric, such as the director riding around D.C. in a truck, reading the Patriot Act through a megaphone.  His effort to recruit congressional members to enlist their children in the military also came across more as peevishness than serious commentary.\n\nBottom-line:  Anti-War activists should buy this movie and watch it weekly--perhaps on Sunday mornings, after singing Kum By Ya with friends.  Die-hard Bush fans should avoid this like the plague.  Those with ambivalence--probably the vast majority--will find this an uneven, but ultimately intriguing film.;Political hit piece that is intriguing, yet at times childish and obscure

Completely ignoring the fact that this movie has very little in common with real documentaries, this movie begins with a rambling, incoherent conclusion  that repetitiously attacks Bush and his administration in every way conceivably possible. Now, I realize most of us already have opinions on a subject and it is good to be honest about the fact that none of us can truly be impartial. But the whole point of a well-crafted argument is that you provide your audience with copious evidence, and you present it in such an artful way that the audience reaches your conclusion by themselves by the end of the movie. This even-handed persuasion obviously escapes Moore, as the first few minutes of the movie consist of a very hateful rant about Bush and his policies. Only after this rant  does Moore begin to provide any evidence as to why we should hate Bush.  The feeling I got from the movie was of a little kid tattletaling on his older brother. That's not to say I don't agree with the general conclusions. But the point of a movie like this should be persuasion. Liberals don't need convincing that Bush is despicable. It's the moderates and conservatives who need persuading, and this crude and poorly put together ""documentary"" surely is not going to do that.";A poorly argued liberal rant.

Liberal media is all NEGATIVE sides, making Bush seem like a bad guy. The last terrorist attack was on 9/11, after that it was his first priority to protect America, he has succeded. There hasn't been a terrorist attack on American soil since then. But Moore makes it look like we haven't done anything about it. Saying he's taking too many vacations. Second of all the War in Iraq, I support it. It's the War on TERRORISM, not the war on Afghanistan. We have proof that Hussein used WMD's, he's killed a million of his own people with vaious poisons. Yes, poison does count as a WMD. We also went into Iraq because they disobeyed the agreements reached after Operation Desert Storm. We asked Hussein to disarm, he said ""No,"" ok, so what does that tell you? Moore also went around to members of congress to sign their sons and daughters up for the armed forces. Wait a minute, its solely the individuals choice to join, not their parents. Moore you are wrong there. What I don't understand is that we are fighting a War and we won't support the presidents descisions? I've also heard people say that America is the world's police, no we aren't, NO ONE ELSE WILL STEP UP BUT US. Moore exploits only a small portion of Iraqis that think that America has no business there. When actually, more people support it than don't. Moore, you are wrong again.

I'm a liberal, and I dislike Bush as a President.  I came into this film hoping to see incendiary information and novel insights; I came out dissapointed.\n\nThe problem isn't that Moore is too biased, too angry, or a demagogue looking for public opinion.  I have seen all three viewpoints vigorously debated on this site, but that's not the issue.  The issue is that his film is disjointed and feels rushed.  The points Moore uses to tie Bush to the Bin Ladens are shoddily presented, and hints that Bush may have welcomed the 9/11 attack further cloud the issue.  Instead of picking a target and homing in, Moore seems content to attack Bush from every conceivable flank, leaving too wide a field and too little substance for things to sink in.  Further, too little of Moore's material is insightful or shocking.  The footage of Bush sitting in a classroom while the first significant attack on American soil since 1812 occured is compelling, but too much of the documentary is ""been there/done that.""\n\nA documentary like this may reflect our country's freedoms and partisanship, but it doesn't reflect a well-constructed film or something worth spending money on- look elsewhere.  4/10";Political affiliations aside, this is an unimpressive film.

249;1098.0;1.0;10.0;"Though this movie is a bit more than the typical bs you watch on tv, it doesn't really tell us all of the truth either.\n\nMoore just ripped off parts of what Alex Jones does. Alex Jones is the original reporter who uncovers the whole new world order and all the conspiracies related to it. For example you don't see Moore talking about how the pentagon was hit by something other than a plane and how the WTC and Oaklahoma buildings had more to their demolitions than the public is aware of. Those are the things that really matter.\n\nWhen Moore was asked by Alex Jones himself why he does not talk about any of the new worlder order issues, Moore said ""it's unAmerican"". So It's unAmerican to talk about the truth? I guess it's only ""patriotic"" if you remain ignorant about reality and do not question anything.\n\nUnlike Moore, Alex Jones is not in it for the money. He clearly states you can copy his films all you want.";Just a tip of the iceburg.
259;1099.0;4.0;10.0;"I was a little apprehensive about viewing this film, but after watching it, I must say that my eyes have been opened a little wider than before.  As a staunch Bush supporter, I was afraid that Moore was going to slam him and his policies unmercifully, but instead, he provides stimulating ""food for thought"".  For example, I found his analysis of Andrew Card's informing Bush of the attack on the World Trade Center very disturbing.  I didn't know that Bush sat in the classroom for almost ten minutes before doing anything.  That is simply unacceptable, even to a die-hard Republican such as myself.\n\nI found Moore's analysis of the Iraq war to be very interesting.  The interviews with the soldiers and family members were especially emotional, especially in the case of Lila Lipscomb, who tearfully reads a letter she received from her son just days before he was killed in a Blackhawk helicpoter crash.  Other scenes, such as the soldier describing the type of music that they liked to listen to when going on attack (""Let the mother#@%^& burn!"") was very disturbing to me.  Finally, being a parent myself, the scenes of the dead Iraqi children were especially difficult to watch.\n\nThere are many items pointed out in the film that I had no idea about, especially the Bush family link to Saudi oil, and how members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to leave the United States after the terrorist attacks, even though all flights in the United States had been banned.\n\nMoore also looks at the disputed 2000 presidential election and claims that George W. Bush was elected by his father's\n\n""friends on the Supreme Court"".  The errors of the networks in projecting a winner in Florida on election night is also looked at.\n\nI have been and always will be a Bush supporter, but I must admit that this film has opened my eyes more about him and revealed things that I didn't know before.  I thought that this was a very thought-provoking film and it did a very good job at explaining Bush's past and some of the events in his presidency that may have been handled incorrectly.  Moore also manages to add a little humor, such as when Bush and his cabinet members are being made up for television, or when John Ashcroft tries his hand at a singing career.  I highly recommend this film.

281;1100.0;1.0;10.0;This work has already been shown to be full of deliberate misrepresentations, distortions, and outright lies.  Moore admitted his bias up front, and people that were included in some of the scenes have complained that their viewpoints were totally distorted.  The liberal Hollywood community pointedly failed to even nominate this turkey for anything such as a Golden Globe or an Oscar.  The effect of this silly mish mash is to reduce Moore's credibility on his other projects rather than to say something real.  Alhough he may look like the proverbial 800 pound gorilla, all he can produce is minor monkey shines.;Moore has no credibility

331;1103.0;2.0;10.0;By now Michael Moore is a true love-him-or-hate-him guy, another face that can ignite rage in some people and smug smiles in others.\n\nI liked Roger & Me, back in 1988 when he could get away with making that film and not get noticed by too many people.  I thought Bowling for Columbine was interesting--at least someone was trying to make a film you could think about, bias or no bias.  There've been shouting matches over whether or not this film is a 'documentary', which should tell you something.  Some dismiss it as 'propaganda', others think it's the 'Truth'.\n\nMy problem with this movie is not the anti-Bush stance, or the questions asked, it's the fact that I can't figure out what the film is about.  This film has no thesis, it hardly has a point to make.  It seems like a long rant about the last four years, starting of course, with more moaning about the 2000 election, suggesting that life would be just rosy if we'd elected the other candidate of the big business party.\n\nGive me a break.  As a documentary, the film is not very good.  As a Moore heart-tugger and audience-reaction-getter, it can be effective.  I don't think you'll learn anything from this movie.  It will either reinforce your views, or give you a fit.  What are you supposed to do with this movie?  Picket the White House?  Moore has all of the resources and by now the money to make a good documentary, but instead he wastes our time with a movie designed to get people NOT to vote for Bush, so you can see how much documentary integrity he cares about.\n\nI like some of Moore's work, including his TV show The Awful Truth, which pointed a funny bone at some issues (the guy dressed as Hitler going to Swiss banks, or 'Corporate COPS'.)  Yes, Bush is a mistake, the war is wrong, but Moore is not the answer.  I'm betting he still has the ability to make food for thought, but you won't find it here or on the 18 billion extras on the DVD, like Bowling for Columbine, which was filled with so much extra 'Moore' that I sold the thing on eBay.;One film won't educate you
334;1104.0;2.0;10.0;Yes, Moore has certainly exercised his First Amendmant rights in making this movie. It is interesting to note, though, that he has a stable of lawyers at the ready to set upon anyone who speaks out against this  entertaining film. Ironic?\n\nThis was an enjoyable piece of fiction, but calling it a documentary is a stretch. Some sources are misquoted, some facts are misstated, some are patched together in a misleading fashion, and I'm sure that some would argue that some are falsified. But falsified is too strong a word -- the fact is that Moore has taken some creative liberties to support his viewpoints, as he has mentioned in the press and on his web site.\n\nThat doesn't take away from its entertainment value. Watch it, enjoy it, but do your own research instead of accepting what's being thrown at you without question. And don't be incensed when you learn that the film is misleading -- it is just a movie after all. Moore takes the pseudo-documentary craft to a new level. The film itself deserves four stars, but I can't in good conscience rate it that highly as it is sorely mislabeled.;Entertaining & thought-provoking, but misguided

339;1106.0;4.0;10.0;"This is an astonishing film; it is astonishing because of Moore's courage to expose president Bush and his present cronies' blatant connection to corporate America, making loads of money from the spoils of the Iraqi war, (these connections are a matter of public record). It is sickening to realize that these so-called leaders are making a disgusting amount of money from the deaths of American boys and innocent Iraqi children. Further to this, the insidious method this administration applied through the media, the out-right propaganda, to justify attacking a sovereign country, spreading fear about terrorism and placing Iraq in the ""terrorist mix"", when Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction, nor are hiding terrorists and have done nothing to the American people, was blatant dishonesty and frightening in every sense of the word. The Bush family are connected to the bin Laden family, also public record. (Their business partners for goodness sake!) It is also public record that the only people allowed to fly, when the whole country was grounded and on red alert after 9'11, was the bin Laden family. Before the smoke even cleared after the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York, the bin Laden family was high tailing out of town, with the approval from the Bush administration - also public record. It has been three years since 9'11, and the masterminds behind and responsible for this terrible act of terror, Osama bin Laden in particular, has never been brought to justice. Why? Have we forgotten about this man, is he no more a threat to us, or has he been conveniently swept under the rug, lost behind the smoke of the (unnecessary) Iraq war? The answer to this question is a simple one: money, lots of money, and its Saudi Arabian money.\n\nAustralians were lied to as well. Our media has never really taken our prime minister to task about Iraq. The only reason, the main reason, our prime minister sent Australian troops to Iraq was the threat of WMD'S. Well there were never any weapons, but our politicians, like Las Vegas magicians, divert our attention with one hand, while doing something else in the other - slight of hand. Our media should be ashamed of themselves, because journalism is no more about truth but about pushing the party line. People are dieing and those at the top are making millions and the media continue to focus our attentions away from this ghastly reality. Sadly, however, looking at the election results, we continue to buy the lies, hook, line and sinker.\n\nMichael Moore had an obvious agenda when making this film. Although his filmmaking style can come across as ""biased"", too one sided, the bottom line is that the facts speak for themselves. Our mainstream media are in business to make money and not to expose the truth. So it is fortunate we have individuals like Michael Moore who care enough and have the courage to tell the real story or at least point out the red flags that continue to pop up in this whole mess.\n\nThis is a confronting film and one everyone should see.";It's about money...
341;1107.0;3.0;10.0;"As powerful as this movie is at times, I was disappointed in it's overall presentation. Michael Moore's often buffoonish approach to disarming the objects of his attacks is less effective in this film, mostly due to the seriousness of the subject. I would have preferred that a more intellectual director would have tackled this one. It's pretty easy to make George W. Bush look like a moron: all you need to do is present footage of him talking. I've read a great deal about the Bush family and this movie taught me nothing new (that doesn't mean YOU shouldn't see it though). Furthermore, the fact that Moore casually insinuates conspiracy theories based on a relationship between the Bush family and the bin Ladens is a little obnoxious. Like all Moore films, this movie is a bit chaotic and fails to really stay on target with any sort of statement other than ""Bush sucks."" This is definately entertainment, NOT a thesis backed up by relevant points. One minute the soldiers in Iraq are heroic victims of Bush's policies, and then suddenly later they are portrayed as bloodthirsty meatheads. The movie is all over the place. I prefer more academic ""documentaries"" (if you can even call this a documentary). If you are not very aware about current events or politics, this movie might be helpful to you. Otherwise, I would recommend movies like ""Control Room"" or ""Manufacturing Consent"" (or anything with Noam Chomsky's name on it for that matter). This movie seems counter-productive to the very necessary discussion on the conflicts between Christian and Islamic cultures, the effect of U.S. foreign policy on other countries, and the real roots of terrorism. Films like this are calculated to achieve an emotional response that will stir people up and make money. Certainly there are important points made and I do agree that Bush is an incompetant president, but I am uncomfortable with Moore's overall approach. Still, the movie is very much worth seeing. It includes a lot of footage that you won't see anywhere else very easily. However, the film isn't as good as Moore's ""Bowling For Columbine,"" and I predict that in another 10-15 years, people will have forgotten all about ""Farenheit 911.""";Subject is too serious for such mud-slinging entertainment.

It is amazing to see how sooo many people fail to make even the slightest effort to look into other views even if they KNOW there are serious problems with the facts of the movie.  It is AMAZING to see how people make decisions based on half truths as long as they are PORTRAYED as if they are facts.  For all of those that looked into other sources, (as any resonable person should do before making an educated decision) my hats off to you, for those who have not done so, I respect your opinion, but unfortunately most of your view is based on half-facts and being manipulated by a skilled movie director.;Interesting Movie
401;1109.0;4.0;10.0;"I liked this movie a lot. Not because it was the greatest documentary ever, or that it was the most accurate: I liked it because it showed how free we really are in this country. We can call the president of our country a stupid liar and subtly play the guitar riff from ""Cocaine"" in the background while Mr. Moore's narrative spoke of what G.W. Bush was doing during the seventies. There are many nations where this would have gotten Mr. Moore into a great bit of trouble.\n\nI think Mr. Moore's methods are relatively sound in that he shoots from the hip and aims for the heart. Was everything in this movie 100 percent accurate? No. Was this a piece of propaganda? Yes. But at the same time it was propaganda, it dared to ask questions that not many people in the media are prepared to ask. Is the war in Iraq just? Was there another way out? Is everything being done to keep our troops safe? What is the real cost of the war?\n\nThere were some amazingly powerful moments in Fahrenheit 9/11. Lila Lipscomb, the mother of an American Soldier who died in Iraq , reading her son's last letter to her. Lipscomb herself was the person who encouraged her son to join the military. Also very powerful was Mr. Moore's showing of the similarities between his run-down hometown of Flint Michigan and comparing them to pictures of post-battle/bomb Iraq.\n\nThere were many parts in this film that I thought were appalling, but more than the rampant corruption in the government (which is almost par for the course these days. .) were the lies that the Marine recruiters told the people they encountered. Telling a sixteen year old that the Marines could set him up with a career in music, or getting complete contact information from on boy so they could ""take [him] off our list"" is simply wrong. That is sick. That in itself sets in people's mind, from the start, that these are people who should not be trusted, and that is not an example of the integrity that has been a beacon of the Armed Forces.\n\nMy only real complaint in this is the fact that many people see everything Michael Moore does as truth and not a hyperbolic representation of the facts. There are even more, who lean toward the right, who see him as a liberal poster-child of anyone left of center. I know this in not Mr. Moore's intention, but it is a side-effect.\n\nIn my mind, this movie accomplished some things. It showed that people who are liberal still love the United States . A consistent theme in the wake of September 11, 2001 was that people who question the government are traitors and that most of those who did the questioning were liberal. This film showed people who love their country enough to encourage their children to enlist in the services, and still love their country after their child was killed.

Being imbuded with patriatism from birth, (mind programming) makes a lot of people easily controlled by the government, all they have to do is say somebody is threatening our country (lie), and immediatley millions of people will think going to war is a good idea. Same with religion, how to get people to think war is a goos idea? say it's gods work, in the name of god. The bible says killing is wrong, yet millions of 'christian' americans supported murdering iraqi's, why? pure mind control. What micheal moore doesn't realise is that when John kerry gets into power, which he will, he's going to use his four years to advance an agenda to crearte a one world government also, democracy is a lie, we live in a one party fascist state unfortunatley, until we decide to do something about it.;new world order

Bush became president in the most disputed, criticized elections in U.S. history. It was the elections where the Supreme Court, the governor of Florida, and the U.S. Senate cast the conclusive vote.\n\n'Farenheit' not only has succeeded in keeping the debate heated over the past elections; the film also will have you wonder about one of the most upheld premises most Americans have taken for granted since kindergarden: ""The United States supports freedom in the World.""\nThe Saudi-U.S., or to be more specific, the Saudi-Bush relationship is a perfect example to attest the opposite. Here you have a monarchy made up of almost 5,000 princes, who along with their local associates, have investments in the United States worth a stunning $860 billion. This number would make approximately 7 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product.\n\nBesides the big money involved from the Saudis, what do you think is the Bush administration's main priority in its 'war on terror'? How much of a 'black sheep' is Osama in the Bin Laden Family? What are the Bin Laden-Bush links? What deals existed between the Taliban and a major Californian oil company? Was the Taliban ever given the red carpet in Houston, back in 1997, when a well-known individual was the governor of Texas? Does Halliburton play a big role in Bush's government corruption or is this just another leftist diatribe?\n'Farenheit 9/11' probes into these and other questions with staggering details and a big dose of sarcastic humour injected by Moore's narrating and acting (check Moore handing over applications to U.S. congressmen and talking them into having their children enlist for military duty in Iraq)\n\nIraq could not be left out of 'Farenheit.' Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke could not put it more bluntly when it came to demystifying the rationale behind invading Iraq: he was being pressured by the administration to fabricate incriminating evidence that would link Saddam Hussein to the Sept. 11 attacks. He even went so far as to say that Bush had plans to invade Iraq even before 9/11. Recall that Clarke's statements were made during a senatorial commission (included in the film) months before the most revealing documentation to date rebutting Bush's casus belli in Iraq came out this October.\n\nIn spite of huge anti-war protests worldwide and the constant flip-flopping of pretexts and all other nonsensical rant to justify the invasion, little could be done to stop the war machine. But what happens when the 'freedom-poised'- U.S. and coalition soldiers take over Iraq after six weeks of 'shock and awe' blitzkrieg?\n'Farenheit' includes some disturbing scenes that the media for some reason neglected: Iraqi mothers and fathers crying hopelessly for their dead children,whose blood -stained, torn bodies are being pulled out of what remains of their homes after an air raid; entire families being terrorized in the middle of the night all while marines drag off men from their homes in the most humilliating fashion all while their children, women, and relatives stand by in panic; hooded prisoners being paraded around and fotographed as if they were trophies of war, with all the chauvinistic and dehumanizing attitude that surely nourished the prisoner-torture atmosphere that sufficed later in the Abu Ghraib case.\n\nMost war correspondents in Iraq have said that their being embedded with coalition soldiers has put restrains to portray a balanced, objective picture of the conflict. Yet, the Swedish cameraman who provided most of the takes to Moore was an embeddded journalist himself, and blames CBS, CNN, MSNBC, and others for refusing to accept his material. More interestingly, he says that most of his takes showing U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners and night raids are commonplace and not random incidents, so he questions why aren't the embedded journalists reporting them as they should (For more complete info, check the Swedish journalist's interview on the DVD features).\n\nNow, the documentary falls short of 5-star rating because it fails to address one of the most fanatic and dangerous driving forces behind the shaping of the Bush administration's foreign policy. These missing dots are crucial understand the present Afghan, Iraqi, and U.S.-U.N-Europe diplomatic crises. First, the  agenda of militarizing the world oil-rich regions and the unilateral 'preventive war' doctrine as stipulated in neo-con  manifestos(for example, the Project for the New American Century). Second, the role of Israel's hardliners for regime change in what it deems unfriendly countries (Iraq, Iran, Syria)and their policy of ethnic cleansing in Palestine's occupied territories.\n\nThis important omission, however, should not deter you from buying or seeing this film; a whole lot of important material still is shown uncensored in 'Farenheit 9/11,' which besides exposing how scandal-ridden and disastrous the Bush administration has proven so far, it also puts the heat on the media's reluctance to distinguish fact from unchallenged government propaganda.\n\nTo make a long story short, 'Farenheit 9/11' remains a living testimony of why Michael Moore's at the top of political documentary-making in the United States and why you need to cast your vote in November. This film is a must-see, if not a must-have.";I'll give it 4.5 stars

However, it doesn't hold a candle to ""Bowling for Columbine,"" which was witty, poignant and funny. Moore's anger showed through in this film, a quality that was out of character for him. I may not be able to be very objective about the subject matter of this film, since I am on the opposite end of the political spectrum from Moore. But you can't take away his talents in story-telling. Moore missed an opportunity to show how little power the politicians really have once they get sucked into the system. People should not come away from this film thinking that they have experienced a indepth analysis of the Bush Administration and how it operates, although I think they will anyway.

1083;1130.0;1.0;10.0;"If you take this as total fact, then I'll gladly sell you the deed to a bridge in Brooklyn that I own.  I love that people say we never should have gone to war with Saddam, that he never posed a threat or attacked us.....WRONG!  I have a big glaring fact to back that up.  Remember back in 1991 when we beat Iraq in the first Gulf War and he signed a treaty with the U.S. and U.N.?  Remember that?  Ok, good.  Now, during the 12 years between that treaty and the launching of the 2nd war, how many times did Iraqi armed forces fire on British and American aircraft in the no-fly zones?  Hmmmmmm?  I seem to recall that the International Rules of Engagement do specify that an act of war is considered when one country commits an attack against another.  So, according to the rules, we had HUNDREDS of reasons to invade Iraq.  This fact is so poorly missed in Moore's distortion of factual truth.  If you watch this film, it does get to you, but it is so anti-Military that this ex-marine did all he could from tearing down the screen.  His interview with the mother who lost her child in Iraq is sad, but here's the thing....HE WASN'T DRAFTED!  HE CHOSE TO GO!  Let me run that by you again, just like I did in 1992, I CHOSE TO JOIN.  Meaning, that as an adult (not children like Moore calls us, an 18 year old may be young, but is still a legal adult) I knew the consequences of joining the military.  I knew that I may have to go to war if the country calls for it.  I'm saddened to see the apathy that permeates our society.  The youth of today have no concept of history, they don't know what it takes to defend freedom.  Telling me, as Moore does in the movie, that Saddam didn't consort with terrorists is like saying that Steven Speielberg never directed ""Jaws"".  Shame on Moore for capitalizing on the deaths of my fellow soldiers who removed one of the most BRUTAL dictators next to Adolf Hitler.  Bravo to the soldiers who wouldn't give Moore the time of day.

I did not find there any good questions and I was not presented with answers worth hearing. I think it was an anti-government, anti-American and an anti-truth production of a very uninformed mind.

Moore has no interest in the truth, though there is some overlap with truths during the course of the movie.  His goal is to evoke anger and passion against the government.  Viewers must be careful to keep a balanced view.\n\nYou or I could take video of virtually anyone (Bush, Moore, any former president, anyone) and find 90 minutes worth of footage to make them look ridiculous. This is just plain unethical and abhorrant.\n\nViewers should also be aware of Moore's real view of us - not in the movie. He is apparently constantly public disparaging the U.S. and its citizens.

1220;1138.0;4.0;10.0;"Upon hearing his Oscar acceptance speech, a rather large part of the select Hollywood crowd booed Michel Moore at open stage. And with similar contempt have been treated most of those in the minority opposing/questioning the War in Iraq. All these were taking place while the official politicians and mainstream media were going along.\n\n Now that Mr. More set out to give a fuller version of his position, people from several quarters are quick to hold him at higher standards than the current executive has ever been subject to. The saddest part, as Mr. Moore concedes, is that while such treatment is understandable from career politicians it becomes way out of place when coming from the anchors in the official (oops, I meant mainstream) media. Indeed, one can only shriek at the viciousness with which the likes of Matt Lauer &CO are attacking ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and, worse yet, Mr. Moore himself.\n\n Anyway, coming to the Fahrenheit 9/11, pity on those who needed Mr. Moore's movie to open their eyes to what has happened for all this time. Pity for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it should have been the jobs of the elected (and not only aspiring) political opposition and the mainstream media to question this administration's rationale for going to war. Secondly, Moore does only a partial and somehow biased job--and there is plenty of reasonable critique addressing this at Amazon.com --at untangling the reasons for the war. Overplaying the emotional card with the poor Flint MI mother or somehow justifying the War on presidential family ties or oil interests seems a little myopic/naive. As a film-maker, Moore passes; As a historian/documentarian he fails; As a pamphleteer he passes with flying colors! Henceforth, the four star rating.\n\n Now, I would like to pose to you, the reader, the following question: How will Moore's movie change the political debate in this country? For it is clear that taking things out of context of what has been the ""civil"" bounds and using them with an electoral goal may poison for good the future political debate. Indeed, if the non-written agreement around transmissible material is broken, as in the case of Mr. Wolfowitz's licking his comb or Mr. Bush's driving a golf ball, the hell may break loose. In any event, nothing prevents the current administration's backers from bankrolling a similar project directed at their political opponents. So, is this yet another first step in an arms race whose result has not necessarily been more responsive/responsible politicians? Then, as consequence, the cynics or the uninvolved citizenry may well fall back on the same arguments, ""they all do it, it's all a scam anyway,"" for not making the most of the wonderful democratic machine at work in America. Let's only hope that the most effect of Mr. Moore's movie will be indeed the mobilization to vote of the 50% segment of uninvolved citizenry.\n\n As a side note, there is no need to bring back the memory of Mr. Clinton for his consciousness cannot be all clear after Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sudan, etc. In Mr. Clinton's defense one can only invoke ""it was the economy stupid!"" and not the litany of relative and partial metrics.\n\n As a second side note, here's Mr. Moore's acceptance speech: ""Whoa. On behalf of our producers Kathleen Glynn and Michael Donovan from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this. I have invited my fellow documentary nominees on the stage with us, and we would like to - they're here in solidarity with me because we like nonfiction. We like nonfiction and we live in fictitious times. We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fictition of duct tape or fictition of orange alerts we are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush, shame on you. And any time you got the Pope and the Dixie Chicks against you, your time is up. Thank you very much.""\n\n To sum it all up, beyond laughter or despair, this movie should mark a moment of sobriety about the current and future states of the affairs of the realm. Provided that the electorate and the politicians do their jobs, (on November and in Congressional Comissions/Committees, respectively), Fahrenheit 9/11 will remain just a talented pamphleteer's opus and not some bad omen for things to come. And only then the biggest failure of all, the American Media Establishment, will not afford not to take notice.";"""Veritas odit moras / Truth hates delay, "" Seneca's Oedipus"

Some of the skits lead to some ""Candid Camera"" style laughs. Michael Moore standing between the Watergate, the Saudi Embassy, and the Kennedy Center gets questioned by a Secret Service agent, funny stuff. Michael Moore with a corporal trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist. Funny reactions! The unplanned, improvised human reactions to the information he produces make you laugh and move you at the same time.\n\nSecondly, Moore does an effective job of dramatizing some of the real costs of war. The documentary footage of some of the casualties of war is tough to watch at times, especially scenes from a VA hospital with amputees. The footage of the effects of the war on the civilians of Iraq is equally disturbing. Interviews with soldiers add a real poignancy to the emotional complexities of those who have a job to serve in a war that they either do not fully understand or that has led to their disillusonment. These human stories where his subjects speak in their own voices are a valuable documentary function to appreciate the spiritual, psychological, and human toll of war.\n\nWhere the movie can be attacked, however, is in his unceasing dislike for Bush and his efforts to establish conspiracy motives for much of our actions in Iraq and in the post 9/11 world. I believe his hatred of Bush, the GOP, and monied interests blind him on how to most effectively make his points. At times, Moore informs me. I learned a lot on the connections to the Saudi government with the Bushes and how political and business concerns impede an effective response to terror. But Bush is not really even a human being in this film. Sure, I hate Bush! Just about everybody left of center hates Bush! A documentary should aid to inform us about who Bush is as a character and a human being, what motivates him, and help us to understand him. A balanced portrayal of Bush would include how his Christian conversion influences his decisions as a crusader beyond a sheer paralyization to monied interests. A balanced portrait would also deal with the fact that funny money has become inherent and endemic to politicians from both sides of the political aisle as I've learned from my studies of Lyndon Baines Johnson and the Texas oil money that funded his rise to power as a champion of liberal causes. Moore spends a lot of time emphasizing how the administration manipulates Americans by an unrelenting message of fear. A conspicuous silence on this count was the total lack of mention of the very real anthrax scare and how this tangible reality of a biological attack put some flesh on the fear that drove us to war.\n\nI felt Moore got us to laugh at Bush by making him a straw man, but if Moore's goal is to elect a democratic candidate, he could have been much more convincing with either a more coherent story arc or a more human Bush.\n\nI am torn on the focus on one mother's pain at the loss of her son. Made me feel her pain; made me worry that he was exploiting her a little bit as well. But I leave that for you to determine as you watch the film.\n\nMoore's obvious liberal bias weakened the film a little bit for me, but I was entertained, periodically informed, and definitely provoked to confront some of my attitudes.\n\nLet's hope that this film sparks necessary dialogue on its strengths and weaknesses, rather than becoming a mere antiBush political rally [there will be plenty of those whether this film existed or not!]. For me, it was entertaining counterpropaganda and I encourage you to view it with an open, engaged mind.\n\n4.5 stars.\n\n--SD [late July 04]";Worth the admission price, maximize impact?
1371;1147.0;5.0;10.0;"I think that every responsible American needs to see this film.  I kept asking everyone I know if they noticed the jump from the bombing by Osama bin Laden to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and search for Saddam. Osama, Saddam, Osama, Saddam, not real easy to accidently mix up! In fact, its quite a jump! Is it really a jump or accident or did the bombing give the Bush administration an opportunity to attack an oil rich country whose military was already compromised?  I was amazed that so few didn't know that there was not a real connection but rather an elaborate lie.  Still the invasion and the search for ""weapons of mass destruction"" went forward against the better judgement of U.N. inspectors who did not find anything.  Most of the rest of the world was against U.S. forces being sent to fight an imaginary war. I have the highest regard for our military personnel and my heart breaks everyday when I read the names, ages, and home states of each of the soldiers that are killed. The loss of American and Iraqi life is saddest part of this war. Our sons and daughters are living the horror of war daily and some are losing their lives while Haliburton and Bush oil are reaping record profits.  Their lives and the lives of their families will never be the same. The families of innocent people in Iraq are in the same boat and we cannot deny, as responsible Americans, that we have dirty hands too.  No matter what your political affiliation, I dare you to see this movie with an open mind and see if maybe there is some material you should check out yourself.  I'm going to bet that you can't deny the truths told in this movie or find convincing truthful data that will dispute the truths found here!";Responsible Voter

1399;1149.0;5.0;10.0;Whether or not you like Michael Moore (I do not agree with all he believes), you must admit he was very brave in making this documentary. This is patriotism at its best! To describe the President as he does and document all his charges for the entire world to see, is just incredible. A number of people say that when we are at war we just just follow the White House words faithfully, to stand beside our President. Well, what if he is wrong, should we all go down with him? Moore has been vocal with his objection to this war when it was at the height of its popularity. Now more people are seeing what this wae is about.\nSome say he is putting up half-truths and outright lies and does not document something that does not support his view. For example, that he did not show the Senator who had a relative in the war. He did mention in the movie that all but one of the Senators he tried to petition did not have kids in the war. He says that Bush spent his first days in office leading to 9/11 (42% of the time)on vacation. He showed a clip of Bush talking tough and then asking the reporters to check out his golf sweing. This coming from a man sending our young people to their deaths! He did not make that up. The way he documented the link between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens also is not made up. How many people knew that the Bin Ladens were responsible for financing George W's first oil company? Also, which companies are the ones that are making a killing (pun intended) from this war. The Patriot Act, the single piece of document that could lead to the destruction of the American way of life (I am a banker and I know what this law allows the government to do).\n  Moore asks if you are looking for someone who is responsible for a killing, who would be the first you would interview? The family, most likely. Why, then, were the Bin Ladens able to leave the country shortly after 9/11 when even the President's own father could not? They left without any questions asked of them.\n  I believe that everyone, whether you agree with Moore or not, should see this film and then decide for themselves if this is a just war.;Patriotism At Its Best!!!
1401;1150.0;5.0;10.0;First of all, maybe you don't have to be left to love this movie, but what do I know, living on Upper WEst side.\nThere is an esprit de revolution in the groups that see this in liberal places, not sure it's true or not in others, laughing at the same times, and for me,\nwhat was omitted in virtually every review is the utter sadness running beneath all the shifting songs, info and humor. I cried non-stop, admittedly the only one.\nHe, Moore, was BRILLIANT with the way he did 9/11. NO towers, no planes, what a relief. But even sadder.\nI do not agree with those formal reviewers who praise him for staying out of much of the film. He's not like Woody Allen, except which do you prefer: When Woody is IN a film or not. Right, IN. Same for me with Michael Moore, who manages to be essentially sweet if also salty and funny.\nThe potshots re: his not being levelheaded and giving two sides is a total joke. He got part of the jig saw puzzle we will never fully get. MOST interesting is all the help he got with facts and footage from I'm guessing--least likely sources. Amazing range of non public material, often not shot, never, by Moore.\nTo those who think he's a wacko, I say, He's OUR WACKO and from Flint, to rise to this level of imagination (NOT LIES) is so brilliant. Especially Michael wondering whatever is BUSH thinking in that school room with the goat book, is a highlight. But then too:\nthere are many. I could watch this four or five more times. Also, I think when the DVD comes out we should buy it to send to those undecided voters. BUT last, I'll say, this did NOT leave me crazy for Kerry, tho I'll vote for him. It left me crazed, aka: deeply disturbed about the old boys network that I fear will never end, left the film dreaming only of moving to Nicaragua, or some such place where wealth isn't so sickenly followed by the few to the detriment and death of the many.

1412;1151.0;4.0;10.0;"In ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" director Michael Moore provides a certain realization supported by both concrete and questionable facts while George W. Bush provides the comedy. In a film that is not merely a machination to poke fun at Bush but also to question and challenge his authority, Moore wants to arouse the audience's senses on a President that has exceeded the exercise of power. Consider this film as a campaign against Bush and its true success can only derive from the inauguration of a man other than him. Well at least in the eyes of Michael Moore.\nMichael Moore is known for his satiric wit and comedy in films such as ""Roger & Me"" and the Academy Award-winning ""Bowling for Columbine."" In ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" he tones down his screen presence and jokes and instead, said he'll let Bush provide the comedy. In this film, we have a more mature side of Moore because by temptation, it could easily have been a film that ridicules the President's mannerisms and so forth. Instead, the main focus is on the citizens of the United States and even that of Iraq. Moore means not to degrade Bush personally but exemplify how Bush has degraded the United States with a failed presidency.\n(...)";We want MOORE!

1437;1153.0;5.0;10.0;Do you have the courage to maintain your intellectual curiosity during these anti-intellectual times?  If so then see this film and enjoy.  As usual, Moore weaves many fortunately found stories together into a compelling narrative whilst not allowing the viewer to leave the theater pessimistic, depressed, hopeless or bitter.  Instead expect to leave more patriotic, aware, skeptical, and mature.  This is the new liberalism that elevates dialogue and returns us all to the opportunities to work together for fairness for all.

1455;1156.0;5.0;10.0;"Having seen Bowling for Columbine earlier, I was pleasantly surprised that in Fahrenheit 911, Michael Moore did bring the end of the movie to a full climax. Unlike Columbine, which left some nagging questions untouched, in Fahrenheit, the ultimate answer was delivered (in the form of a quote - make sure you don't miss it!), in the last few seconds of the movie. Bravo.\nAs a citizen well-informed how corrupt and discredited the last 20 or so presidential administrations are on Capitol Hill, I did not expect any major new revelations from Fahrenheit 911. I was wrong. In the first hard-hitting episode that I have not seen anywhere else, black voters protest in the Senate from being scratched from the voting rolls and not one senator, even a Democratic one signs their bill. It reminded me of the early stage of the disenfranchisement of the Jews in Hitler's Germany. In both cases, ""representatives"" of the people ceased representing their constituents to favor personal enrichment. (They obtained ""special"" loans, mortgages, and other favors from the ruling clique to pay for their obedient going along. History repeats.)\nThe second scene that recalled shades of Nazi Germany even closer was a meeting of corporation heads organized by Halliburton where a bunch of CEOs discuss the financial windfall of Iraq ""once the oil starts flowing."" It was eerily ressemblant of Hitler, Krupp, Otto Ambros of I.G. Farben and other CEOs discussing the financial windfall of WW2 ""once the Romanian and Russian oil starts flowing"" in 1933. Perhaps the French writer (whose name I forgot) was right and capitalism DOES inherently decay into fascism over time? To judge from this scene, our biggest present-day corporations  sure appear eager to embrace this form of militarized robbery. Will those CEOs be as eager to face a war tribunal and potentially a firing squad for it? Funny how that didn't came up. Just like in 1933.\nOverall, Fahrenheit 911 is definitively a movie worth seeing and thinking about. I could add only two small wishes. 1.) I wish Moore read Al Martin's book ""The Conspirators"", to understand that none of the Bush company failures were failures, but successful financial scams to drum up financial contributions, and 2.) It took 40 years after WW2 for the truth to come out that the Nazi war effort would have never amounted to anything without the huge financial infusions from the Rothschilds and the US Federal Reserve - the very circles making a windfall on the ensuing massacre. Will it take another 40 years for the truth to come out whether  the same financial circles who pushed us into Iraq this time?

""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Moore's most accomplished film in that his evidence is pieced together in the most coherent and accurate fashion of any of his other films.\nBe forewarned, this is a propaganda film and how you receive Moore's perceptions and point of view will shape how you feel about this film in general.\nBush and his cronies come off the worst and this of course is Moore's point. But even though I think that Moore has a lot of guts to even attempt such a thing, he is smart enough to realize that that his film will divide most who see it. But Moore's most important contribution is that he will have all who see this film...THINKING and analyzing the connections he makes between real events and real people.\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is shocking, frightening and thought provoking: what other film in recent history has had this effect?\nGod Bless Moore and God Bless America for allowing him the freedom to do so.";Connections
85;1159.0;2.0;9.0;"I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a ""1 + 1 = 3"" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is ""If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie.""\n\nAs for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.\n\nI want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.\n\nAs for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?\n\nI suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right? Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.\n\nIn modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want. Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.\n\nIn conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.";The magic of Moore

All of the people who have been critiquing this film, are no doubt conservative, but are also immature, misinformed, and can only bury their heads in the sand, rather than accept the truth. I am sick of reading reviews where people say that he only shows one side of the story and that the documentary isn't true. Moore does a great job of having backed every single thing he says up with solid evidence. You cannot deny evidence. And all of the scenes it shows of Bush? Like one reviewer said, Moore didn't hire some guy to dress up as President Bush and act retarded. Moore didn't hire actors to play army recruiters and politicians. Everything in his film is 100% authentic. And how can he show the other side of the story? There is no logic argument against the facts that Moore portrays. Do people think he is making this stuff up? Again, everything said is backed by evidance. How could people not be sad by watching a woman make a trip to Washington DC after her son was killed in an unnecessary war, and then having the door slammed in her face? That should even make a conservative sad- and if it doesn't, than you are completely heartless and have absolutely no sympathy. I am sick of hearing right-winged idiots talk about how military personell and veterans ""know the truth and support our country and think Moore is a liar"" whenever there is an entire book ""Will They Ever Trust Us Again?""

113;1162.0;4.0;9.0;"I'm late to the party, but I finally got around to watching Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" today and I'm glad I waited. I never read the reviews or the hype on either side, and I'm not a big fan of Moore's, so I had no preconceived notions about the film. I was surprised that his documentary didn't really focus on the events of September 11 other than to frame them as a pretext for invading Iraq, which any literate person knows by now as an irrefutable fact. I think Moore exploited 9/11 to market his movie, but I disagree that he would be averse to any conspiracy theories that suggest that 9/11 was an inside job. Who knows, maybe he's working on a new film to highlight the 9/11 Truth movement; if not, he should be.\n\nI remember watching ""Roger and Me"" on video back in the summer of 1994 that inspired a trip to Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan to see for myself the wasteland portrayed in his first (and perhaps most authentic) documentary. Moore uses some of the same techniques in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" that he used in ""Roger"": interviews with senior citizens, the disenfranchised poor, various authorities, and a family of military veterans, interspersed with comic relief in spoofs, pop music backdrops, and unflattering innuendo of his target. In ""Roger and Me"" it was Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors; in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" it's George W. Bush. Both are portrayed as avaricious, secretive demagogues oblivious to the plight of the common man. By all accounts, this is an accurate assessment.\n\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is even more relevant now than it was in 2004 because of the subsequent release of the disappointing and disingenuous 9/11 Commission Report, and the surfeit of evidence that points to counterfeit intelligence and deliberate duplicity that led our nation to war. It's also more disturbing because the situation in Iraq is worse than it was two years ago, the death toll is rising, and there is no end in sight.\n\nCritics of the film have produced a rebuttal entitled, ""Fahrenhype 9/11,"" featuring conservative shills like Ann Coulter and Dick Morris, claiming to ""tell the truth about terrorism."" Director Alan Peterson's answer to Moore's award-winning film is utterly laughable in light of all we have learned in recent months about the so-called ""war on terror"" and the role of high level government conspirators who likely engineered the ultimate ""wag the dog"" scenario to launch their arrogant campaign of global domination. But, it's always enlightening to see both sides of the story, especially once you're informed.

For example, the clip where Britney Spears says "" we should all support our president Bush"" was take out of context much  like the American soldiers in Iraq acting psychotic and making them seem like they lost it and were killing everyone randomly. But yes, the Bush administration and politicians and the goverenment in general are all corrupt and evildoers. This is how the American society is. The rich justs keeps getting richer and the middle and lower class are becoming poorer. And everything in our society is in favor of the rich. For example, Paris Hilton.  If the Paris Hilton incident happened to someone else that person would've been behind bars for 5 to 10 years. But poor Paris was whining and crying and said ""this isn't right"" by serving only 20 something days. Our US laws and our government are a big joke.";great documentary movie

267;1175.0;5.0;9.0;Well...after reading some of the reviews that said this was banned on bases you will think not so shocking if you have watched this movie!  The movie does not tell you what to think and if you don't believe something in the movie then you still will not believe it when the movie is over so what is the harm in watching this movie?!  I absolutely love this movie.  I was opened up to Michael Moore when I watched Bowling for Columbine and have been following him closely since then.  I wanted to see this movie at the movie theater, yet the people who I know did not want to go and support this movie...their choice!  I did however buy it the day it came out and was pleased I bought it.  I absolutely love it and it opened my eyes to controversies that I thought might be happening, but was sure how they would go about it.  I think my favorite part in the movie was when Michael Moore and a recruiter for the military stood outside the Capital building and tried to Recruit the children of government people.  Just funny how they don't want to send their own kids but would send everyone else's in a heartbeat.  Food for thought...I also loved the way it went from serious to silly and also posed thought provoking questions.  I think everyone should watch this movie at least once and if you don't like it then don't watch it again!  Everyone is entitled to an opinion and if you don't watch this movie and  judge it,  then you are spreading ignorance,  if you watch this movie and then don't like it at least you will have a base to go from!  I don't think this movie will change opinions but I think it will provide food for thought.  My biggest peeve is that people who have not seen this movie talk about how bad it is...yet they have nothing to base that opinion on!  This movie is in no way unpatriotic!  It is actually quite patriotic-Michael only wants the best for the people of the United States and especially for our troops all over the world! Hope everyone who checks out this movie at least watches it to form their own opinion!;Opens your eyes...
271;1176.0;5.0;9.0;"I watched ""Rodger and me"" a few months ago, and sometimes found Moore to be a bit too biased, so I really didn't really know what to expect from this movie. True, he sometimes draws a bit far-fetched conclusions on pretty loose facts, but rather than dismissing the film as propaganda, we should take this as an encouragement to think for ourselves! Beliefs that cannot be questioned are not beliefs, they are myths. From my point of view, Michael Moore has made a brilliant documentary, which despite some far-fetched ideas essentially comes down to be just so true. In this fantastic world of precision bombing, war seems to be just another videogame. You just have to watch the last 20 minutes to get to know what war is REALLY about.";just so true

292;1181.0;4.0;9.0;"I just finished watching this film and I have to say that it raises substantial questions about George W. Bush. I'm aware that no one will ever know the whole truth but there are things that can't be ignored ie. "" did he really use 9/11 as an excuse to invade Iraq ""? (since he never had a problem with them when they were on good terms). Because all the Iraqi oil is going into his hands, IMHO greed and self-gain certainly do play a role.\n\nIMO a leader of any country is elected to:\n\n 1. Protect and defend his Country\n\n 2. Better the Country and the lives of his people\n\n 3. Be a good role model to his people\n\nYes, I think being a leader is a hard job but I also think that if someone is going to run for this position then they should truly want to do it for those reasons. It always surprises me that a majority of people who end up as leaders have led such priviledged lives. How can they know what the general population needs? I wish that someday someone honest, noble and inspiring will lead my Country. I guess there is a reason why people say ""there are no honest politicians"". Here, I read about corrupt government officials stealing tax dollars all the time.....*sigh* maybe that's because the majority who get to the top are scumbags ~ But I won't give up hope because I always believe that when it comes to good vs. evil, good ALWAYS wins.";~ Decide for yourself instead  ~

And as I left the theater I felt Angry and also ashamed, ashamed that I had known nothing about any of this period!\n\nThe day after seeing this movie I started watching CNN; I started carrying more about what my government was doing and how they did ""business.""\n\nI have three friends in the military; two are in the navy-one in the air force. When they had leave and were home to visit. I sat them each down and showed them this movie. Well to say the least they didn't care for it at all. (Personally, I'm just glad they watched the whole thing). They were after all the perfect candidates for the military. They got crap grades in high school, they never got jobs so they just blew there savings, and really like shooting things (seriously).\n\nLater on while we were watching T.V. A GO NAVY commercial came on and all three admitted that if they were sent to Iraq they wouldn't re-enlist and just take what ever jobs they could when they got home.\n\nNow on to Michaels film. Personally I don't see Bush as a criminal mastermind (Dick Cheney maybe) I see bush more as a puppet. Now on to the part of the film that I loved ""The War On Terror.""\n\nThe fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction and the fact that were stealing there oil basically proves.....yes we are in this war for all the wrong and greedy reasons. Don't think I'm some ANTI-War idiot I think that the people in Iraq did need help. But, all we did is make things worse for them.\n\nThank You\n\nP.S.\n\nKeep up the good work Michael.";Your all missing the Big Picture!

Michael Moore accepted the award in honor of our service men and women overseas.\n\nThe movie is a documentary. It takes an anti-administration position. The movie is entertaining and pushes for changes in the Government's position in Iraq and in other issues. The movie gives this viewer the feeling that it is about 50% spin and about 50% truth. However, the film is still chilling since a USA Administration in power has such awesome power that the truth is hard to differentiate from the Administration's own spin. Blues, you are wise to be concerned. Reds, do not be blinded by the Administration's own spin.;Entertaining & Thoughtful - People's Choice Award Winner
396;1184.0;5.0;9.0;"A lot of people who criticize this film do so claiming it's biased and not a documentary. Moore stated in interviews from the outset that his intention was to motivate people to vote against Bush. I wonder if the same people who criticize the film are concerned that Bush was re-elected, in part, for the belief he'd select conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. Like Pascal's Wager, what the ""right"" fails to realize is that if their beliefs are wrong, a lot more suffering and needless restrictions on human rights occur that wouldn't have occurred had the ""left"" agenda been realized and been in error.* Likewise, I ask in relation to the film, what's worse?: A film that masquerades as documentary (when the ideal is to be unbiased) or a pre-judiced supreme court nominee who will masquerade as judge?\n\n*These comments are assuming that fetuses don't suffer (and there's no credible evidence that the contrary is logically possible.

420;1188.0;1.0;9.0;"The review I was looking for was on the first page a week ago.\n\nOut of all the reviewers, He was a soldier at present serving in Iraq. That review moved me more than any out of the 711 I searched through to find it. It was so moving that I just wanted to write and say as for all the rest all I could think is that it is just a movie and if it offended one person who puts his life on the line for our country and flat tells you why and the reasons were very good and his information not long and drawn out but more informative than all the opinions I read and all I wished was I could of found that one review which moved me so much because he gave some facts from the frontline and he loved his country and is trying to do his job and that he was offended by this movie and I think that said it all. So because the movie has made it's way into my home and not by me because I was not even going to watch it because of the pain it caused just that one person putting his life on the line and believing in the cause I can only add how sorry I am that you are there and gave some facts that I completely  believed more than this unbelievable amount of reviews without facts and only opinions. I would just like to say I enjoyed your review and still have not saw the movie but would like to say I am sorry that you were offended and pray you are well and make it back home to the America you love!!!! God Bless You. Thanks for the facts. Be Safe. God Bless America and God Bless You for what you are doing and because you love your country. I believe in you and not some stupid movie.\n\nAnd I am a movie lover. But it seems to me this one is not going to be a movie that i will find entertaining and there are so many that are very entertaining. I love art , but not just total clueless bashing. I hope Bush gets us out of Iraq and you are a true american whom touched my soul and I hope all these other reviewers read your review which was to the point and the best review I read. It is very late or early depending on how you look at 5:15am and I am only sorry I could not find your review but maybe now that I have let others know where you are they may have the chance to read it. It seems these days they will pay the most money for the lowest type of charaters. It is really shocking what vulgur types get paid. I still have not seen the movie but it is so shocking these days what type famous people get paid millions to be vulgur. I bet I do not have to explain that. But instead maybe they should be paying more for our military men like you who truly love your country. Been up all night and am a bit cranky but just wanted to hopefully get others to read your review. Maybe even Mr Moore??\n\nWhen I first read your review it was on the first 3 or 4 pages.\n\nI have not been able to find it up to the 700's. I only mentioned the fact about the millions paid to vulgur types because maybe and I cannot be positive on this because I have not seen this movie but it sounds like a bunch of speculation bashing of the president. I do not like movies that are maybe in bad taste and less artistic. From the reviews it sounds more like personal opinions. Mean Spirited. But when it offends the very people who are defending our country and believe in the cause it can't be a good thing. Give me a good Mel Gibson movie,Give me good drama, Give me action, adventure, comedy, but do not give me mean spirited movies. Honestly, In fact you would have to tell me what else this man has directed. I love movies. I  am a movie buff and I love some really out there stuff.

421;1189.0;5.0;9.0;"This is a great film! The people from the Academy Awards and those at the Cannes Film Festival can't be wrong, even Ebert & Roper agree, Michael Moore is a great documentarian. Before you start bashing the movie please realize that a documentary doesn't necessarily have to be objective. Some are confusing documentaries with journalism. Although a documentary can strive to be objective there are no rules prohibiting a director from presenting a subject matter from a certain perspective. Some Americans are so lazy, they expect everything to be presented to them in a way in which they don't have to think. Come on people wake up and use your God given brain. And please people, do read the news; don't expect to get your news from a documentary.";Viva Michael Moore!!
423;1190.0;5.0;9.0;I found it very sad to read some of the other reviews for this film. It appears to the rest of the world that Americans cannot accept criticism and one other reviewer (you know who you are!) proved the point true exactly! I am English and am thoroughly ashamed of our Prime Minister's role in this 'war' and can only sympathise with the American people for what they have to live with! All that Michael Moore does in this film is highlight the facts that already exist. It would seem that most of the non-American world already knew these facts, but the ones they didn't only serve to inform and educate us all of the ridiculousness of the times we live in.;True
448;1191.0;1.0;9.0;Ah yes, I remember Moore's statements on how no one who saw his movie could vote for Bush. The bloated liar was so convinced that Bush would lose, and his film would have a hand in it. It appears that the American people are not as gullible as Moore thinks. In the movie Moore makes fun of and villifies Bush... a lot. But on this day after the election I have just one question for michael moore. Who is laughing now?;Ineffective
531;1192.0;4.0;9.0;I found this film to be rather tremendous, and strongly recomend the DVD version to all other parents whose children occasionally have difficulty sleeping.  Sure to get the tykes dreaming sweetly before the end, much like Disney's Cinderella.;Terrific
551;1193.0;5.0;9.0;Michael Moore is an American hero who fights for the truth. This is a great movie. It features touching images and stories that are (and this is sad) not shown by the American mass media.;The untold truth!
564;1194.0;5.0;9.0;Notice that while a few Bush supporters complain in their typical vociferous, name-calling style, this DVD gets an overall rating of 4 stars. Do yourself a favor: watch this before Nov. 2 and make your own judgment. It's a powerful film.;Eye-opening
574;1195.0;5.0;9.0;I had never seen a Michael Moore movie and didn't know what to expect. While the film maker makes clear at the onset that Moore is biased against Bush, it is actual footage of President Bush that exposes himself to his own words, behavior and actions.  Moore poignantly handles the darker side of the war from a very personal perspective with the families and soldiers. He is very supportive of the plight of the soldiers and families and uses no trickery but rather employs the real words and footage, and its effect is very moving and powerful. Moore forces us to see the realities of President Bush's zealous march into Iraq, looking for the concocted WMDs. While parts of this movie were sad to see, others were outright funny. One sees the hilarity and hypocrisy of the pro-war Congressmen who wouldn't dare send their kids to the front line, never mind the fact that both Cheney & Bush did all they could to avoid seeing facing any real combat during the Nam war. Moore is brave to examine and question the rush to Iraq and showcase, those who stood to gain and the unfortunate who bore the real cost from this action. I'd highly recommend this film to all teenagers and adults.;Real footage, Real people, Real captivating
597;1196.0;4.0;9.0;"Yes, commentary, not documentary.  But it's still wildly entertaining, though not quite as amuzing as Bowling for Columbine.  If you've read ""Dude, Where's My Country?"", then you will have a good idea of the content of Fahrenheit 911.  However, don't overlook the special features:  Condolezza's testimony before the 911 commision (Ms. Rice, what was the name of the PDB document?  Uh, I believe it was ""Bin Laden Determined to Attack within The United States"".---HILARIOUS!).  There is also some very eye-opening footage of Iraq before the war (looks a lot less like a hellhole than George would have us believe).  And don't miss ""W"" addressing the media after he and Cheney talked to the 911 commission (""I'm glad I took the time.""  WHAT?).\n\nThe thing, though, about this movie, is that you have to view it as entertainment.  Mr. Moore's points are not all valid, but you have to admit the guy's opinions are very thought-provoking.\n\nFor a great companion piece to this film, check out the documentary ""Outfoxed"".  The hypocrisy and lies of the Bush regime in 911 is hilariously well-matched by Rupert Murdoch's hypocrisy and lies, supporting this administration and their invasion of Iraq in ""Outfoxed"".";Great Commentary
644;1197.0;5.0;9.0;See this movie! It reports everything that the republican media doesn't tell you! Don't listen to republican rebuttal! They're afraid of the truth!

Every ounce of information is well documented and outlined and includes the source of information! You can't argue with that!;Great movie. A must see!
657;1198.0;5.0;9.0;If you have not seen this movie because you may have different political views than Michael Moore, that is no excuse.  His movie takes what we are all too afraid to say, and slams it into our faces.  I believe that everyone should see this movie.  You may not agree with everything that is in it, but it will truly open some eyes.  There are things you think you know, but you do not know for sure until you have watched this powerful movie.  It will make you laugh, cry, and most of all, spit in anger.  I recommend this movie to everyone that thought something wasn't right with our government over the past 4 years, and to those of you who saw nothing wrong.;Democrat and Proud
667;1199.0;5.0;9.0;Republican or democrat, liberal or conservative, rich or poor, left or right, who cares, just watch this.  It would be nice if people just threw away their biases and affiliations and just for once, opened up their minds.  In an age of unprecendent media viewership and domination of the world, it's hard to tell what to accept and what not to accept.  However, one always knows whether something is right or wrong.  A live clip of an explosive attack against a post of American troops, mutilated corpses, dead babies...those are nothing that special effects could ever touch. These things could never be staged.\n\nI don't care what your beliefs are, but if you just walked away from this movie, shrugging it off with whatever premanufactured dismissals of a work of this nature and magnitude, you are beyond ignorant.  A forceful generalization, yes indeed.  If you refuse to watch this film for any other reason than it's extremely graphic and rather disturbing nature, you need to open up your eyes to the real world.\n\nMichael Moore is obviously biased, but who isn't?  I will not say that I completely agree with his beliefs, having read all of his works and watched Bowling for Columbine.  However, in Fahrentheit 9/11, Moore barely interjects his opinions like has in his previous works.  He does something that very fiew journalists, news channels, politicians, and Americans have remotely done--let the evidence do the talking.\n\nI give this movie 5 stars as a concerned individual growing up in this world.  I am not even old enough to vote, and I have no political affilations.  I am giving it 5 stars because it realistically depicts the realities of this world.  Let me place an emphasis on reality.  Fahrentheit 9/11, though clearly biased and with certain discrepancies, shows you what numbers, campaign ads, newspapers, news stations, and politicians cannot--reality.;Republican or democrat, doesn't matter. Please watch this
683;1200.0;3.0;9.0;"Moore's film, while funny and intertaining, should not be called a DOCUMENTARY. I am sorry to break it to everyone, but this film was so slanted it was teetering on fiction. Facts, soundbites and footage were arranged with dramatic flair to wage war on Moore's sworn enemy--George W Bush and our government's policies. It's great we live in a country that someone can make millions bashing the government that is actually fighting for that very RIGHT. I applaud Michael Moore for his guts and creativity but I believe\n\nhe has irresponsibly taken advantage of the public's Hollywood-induced gullibility; in an effort to weaken this country's already questionable solidarity.

61;1201.0;5.0;8.0;You people should take that Declaration of Independence and burn it to ashes because after seeing this film I can't believe that anyone in their right mind would still be voting Republican. I'm not even American and I'm a more active democrat than all y'all! The evidence has been placed before the American people yet they have failed to overturn this evil administration that misled the world into a war with Iraq to satisfy their greed and their insatiable craving for oil. When I was a kid I always dreamt of going to America and being part of the American dream but I think I speak for many people when I say that the international community has never had a lower opinion of the United States. To blindly support a dyslexic moron in a presidency that is more focused on robbing poor nations of their resources is not the honorable image of America that I carried in my heart as a child. Now that I am an adult, I am witnessing the rich Republicans sending the poor of their own country to be killed by poor people in other countries, misleading the American public with falsified evidence to support their war machine, blowing up children and civilians in foreign countries in order to gain access to their resources in effect stealing from the people who have nothing while all the time declaring to the world in a self-righteous attitude that the worst is yet to come. America may have accomplished great things in the past when truly great men were elected as their presidents but the fact that the Bush administration is in control of the world's fate even after this documentary has exposed them for the lying bunch of baby-killers that they are should be enough to prove to the world that indeed dark forces are in control of American politics today.;I can't believe George Bush STILL won the elections!

Are troops need support not people trying to make a name for themselves every good american should boycott making mr moore anymore rich than he already is if he wants to make a difference maybe he should run for president instead of hiding behind his one dimensional films of propaganda we are americans and I think its time michael moore  woke up and started to act like one also he refers the service members as children. Well mr moore news flash everyone one of the service members are their by their own free will because there hasn't been a draft in a long time so don't treat them like they are children because they aren't their heroes defending are constitution against foreign and domestic threats and are way of life. So please do all the american people a favor and stop act because most people know what your all about I say to everyone who is thinking about buying this DVD buy something else because you will enjoy it alot more.

783;1204.0;5.0;9.0;"This is a must see.  George Bush is a most dangerous man.  This movie only touches upon the secrets which are glossed over by the mainstream media.  Check out the picture of the young George Bush at an oil well dedication in the book entitled ""The Prize.""  It's easy to see what the motivating factors are behind this war.  Iraq has the 2nd largest known oil reserves on this planet.  I really find it hard to believe Bush wishes to see democracy in a predominately Islamic fundamentalist society.  We really have more in common with the minority Sunni's (which is why we supported Iraq in the war against Iran).  Do a search for a classic photo of Rumsfield and Saddam shaking hands during Donald's visit to Iraq.  The US military was completely aware that biological weapons were being used against Iran at that time.  Currently, our media is not covering the Niger yellow cake story because it would be inappropriate before the election.  Talk about forged documents.  So, thank you Michael Moore for getting a very small yet disturbing amount of information to those who are not afraid to ask the difficult questions for fear of being labeled ""unpatriotic.""

Another thing that pissed me off, they didn't give me a refund at the movie theatre.  A movie as horrible as this one, you should get a refund.  I can't believe that there are morons in this country that no only think this piece of crap was good, but also believe all the BS in this movie..

889;1210.0;1.0;9.0;Ahh yes, when you've got Fidel Castro, Hamas and the Iranian government on your side surely you must be a true patriot. Why keep pretending to be patriotic? This film is being used around the world as anti-american propaganda. Wake up people, that's exactly what it is. Michael Moore is making an impact on world events all right. The result of which will add up to more dead Americans and more terrorism abroad. Why buy the dvd? Just send your money to the Taliban, Al Queda or Saddam Husseins legal team instead.;Moore, Castro, Hamas and Tehran: Friends forever...

Jeb and W have their team ready to do it again this year folks....and this time we better be ready to fight back!;Please see this movie!
977;1212.0;5.0;9.0;I was impressed.  I mean, I've never been a big Michael Moore fan -- I'm still ticked off at him for backing Ralph Nader in the 2000 elections, and I think his reasoning is often overly simplistic and fuzzy-minded.  But I think this movie did an excellent job of making his leftie-pragmatic viewpoint accessible to mainstream America, and the information is presented in a very thoughtful, persuasive manner.  There are many, many things in this movie that I have simply not seen in the media before, or even heard about -- notably the squelching of Congressional dissent in the 2000 elections, a travesty presided over by Senate leader Al Gore, and some of the gut-wrenching footage from Iraq, which, amazingly, was fairly restrained, considering how much more, and much more gruesome footage must be available.  Anyway, I guess now I'm more grateful that Michael Moore is out there.  The current climate of trying to cut off all discussion and debate on issues of national disagreement, the my-way-or-the-highway attitude of the GOP media machine, is profoundly un-American, and if left unchecked may threaten the foundations of our very society.  (Debate and honest differnces of opinion makes us stronger and wiser, fellas!!)  So, I respect Moore for his persistent role in keeping civic discussion free and open, even if I don't always agree with him.  If you think you disagree with Moore, but haven't seen the movie, see the movie, and then decide how much you still disagree with him.;If you think you disagree with Moore, at least see the movie

Of course it is biased, overwrought, and serves the political purpose of the director, Democrats, and Mr. Kerry.  The republicans are upset about it, and would like it suppressed  and understandably so.  Now we have the Swift Boat book and TV ads with the exact same reaction from the Democrats. I am sure there is in truth it also; but again it is overwrought and written for a political purpose. How can each party be so upset at one of these pieces of propaganda and embrace the other?";It's a crazy country.
1042;1214.0;5.0;9.0;"Thank God Michael Moore is out there, speaking for the common man. Though this controversial documentary had a hard road making it to theaters, ""Farenheit 9/11"" has proved that Americans have had enough of the Dubyah Regime and are ready to move on (to the tune of 116 million dollars and counting!).  Bush and his far right conservative circle want to keep his ties to the Bin Laden family and to the Saudi's a secret but Moore and other's like him are determined, fortunately for the rest of us, to make sure that these truths see the light of day.  Republicans are gonna bash Moore for this direct hit on their moronic golden boy because they want to keep him in office four more years so the upper 1 percent of our country, the wealthiest, can continue to profit while the middle class shrinks to nothing and those at or below poverty level continue to grow.\n\nMoore, of course, is gonna be biased against this dictatorship, (whoops! I mean presidential administration), and opponents are quite willing to say he lies and creates propaganda against their beloved King George II in order to derail his bid for re-election.  Moore doesn't have to make up things or create propaganda for this film, Dubyah has given him more than enough ammunition---Bush has backed himself into a corner with his lies and outright deception on Iraq and our reasons for being there. Bush has done NOTHING to help our country, has only divided after a national tragedy should have brought us together and helped us stand together as a nation.  Bush has alienated us from the rest of the world although he gives us the impression that there are many nations behind us---a lie that Moore exposes with humor in the movie.\n\nThe only thing I wish Moore would have touched on a bit more was Bush's use of the church and Christ as a banner he wears to, not only gain support for his ridiculous decisions, but also to explain his reasoning for making those decisions.  People I know vote for this man simply because he is anti-abortion and anti-same sex marriage----they give absolutely no regard to his complete annhilation of our relationship with the world community, the complete lack of interest in guarding our envirnoment and the blatant attack on our civil liberties and rights as American citizens.\n\nI'm proud to live in America and I am greatful that we are (for the time being) a country in which we can speak our minds without fear of harrassment or imprisonment.  America deserves a better president and our soldiers NEED a better Commander and Chief---one that won't send them into harm's way to suit his whims and his pathetic need to avenge his father's failure to catch a dictator a decade ago.  I hope that 9/11 is a film that will jolt American's awake from an apparent deep sleep that allowed this administration to steal our rights, send our young men and women to war without a real reason and give tax breaks that really didn't help any of us that really needed it.  WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!!\n\nI plan to see this film again and will ABSOLUTELY buy a copy of this dvd as soon as it is released.  I may also buy it as gifts for anyone I know who is silly enough to consider voting for that clown in the Oval Office again.  As for Michael Moore, I salute you for your efforts and look forward to your future documentaries and books.";We need MORE of MOORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1059;1215.0;5.0;9.0;I will start this off by saying that I am a fan of Michael Moore, I loved Bowling For Columbine and I have read quite a few of his books.  Biased as this movie might seem to the uneducated eye, it is right on the money.  Michael Moore has a team of accrediable fact checkers, so while it may seem what he may be telling you is one sided it is nontheless the truth.  For those of you who support Bush in all his endevors, you may not have heard some of the things he has said when he strays from the speech his writers prepare for him for nearly all public performances.  As sad and hard to believe as it is The United States is one of the most hated countries because of this whole Iraq thing.  When he strays he says the most appaulingly idotic things.  I for one am ashamed that I am represented by a President who sounds uneducated.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a wonderful documentary that envoked many emotions in me, sadness, anger, and embarrassment. I suggest that even if you are not a fan of Michael Moore and like Bush watch this and see the other side's point of view.;Michael Moore gives us what we truely deserve, truth.
1068;1216.0;3.0;9.0;"Anyone who sees this film, and still votes for Bush, is a brainless ditto-head, whose thought process and critical thinking skills have been erradicated either by overexposure to Fox ""News"", Rush Limbaugh, or Karl Rove has taken over your brain.  Dispute whether this is a documentary or propaganda all you would like. Doesn't matter.  Was the Iraq war really fought for oil and war profiteering or to remove despot from a rogue state? Even that doesn't matter, at least not at this point, anyway. Is this scene or that fact or fiction? Even THAT doesn't matter. Like Moore, hate him - it's inconsequencial.  For this film contains one astonishing scene, caught on tape, that calls into question Bush's fitness to be commander-in-chief.  The infamous 7 minutes.\n\nWhile our nation was under attack, Bush was advised by Andrew Card(?) as he read My Pet Goat to some fourth graders in a Florida school. There he stood, seemingly terrified, like a deer with its eyes caught in the headlights, with nary a clue what to do, for over seven minutes.  Unbelievable.  What an absolutely amazing display of ineptness and utter lack of leadership skill. If there is one sequence that exposes this president as the fraud that he is, it's that one.\n\nHave you ever been paged in the office and had to drop what you're doing because business crisis had emerged? Have you, in your life ever had to react to an emergency situation that required immediate action?  Our nation was under attack.  There was no question about it.  Our ""quick thinking"" leader sat - obviously terrified, reading My Pet Goat, in a critical situation when thousands (millions?) of lives were at stake, when time was of the essence, as our NATION WAS UNDER ATTACK BY TERRORISTS!\n\nThis scene alone should disqualify President Bush for a second term, he is simply, as evident by this sequence, unfit for command.  ""War President"", indeed.  When I heard about this scene, before I saw the film, I almost dismissed it.  I found myself (gasp) siding with the Bush apologists.  Uh uh, see it for yourself.  It completely calls into question Bush's ability to handle crisis situations.  I think it will even give hard right Bush supporters pause.  Disagree over ideologies - right vs left, there ARE fundamental characteristics that the leader of the free world must possess that transcend these ideologies.  Highest among them is the ability to handle a crisis.  Anyone who can't do it has no busness in the oval office.  Clearly Bush, as evident in this scene, doesn't have the right stuff.\n\nHaving said that, the film completely misses the boat regarding an item critical to its thesis.  That item is The Project for a New American Century.  More attention needs to be focused on this document. For this, clearly, outlines the reasons we went to war in Iraq.  911 was viewed as a once in a lifetime window of opportunity to execute the neoconservative agenda; the democratization of the middle east through the use of force.  That they did, to the tune of approaching 1000 US military deaths, 10-15 thousand Iraqi deaths, and $200 billion US tax-payer dollars.  Moore leaves this out of his film.  Perhaps it isn't sensationalistic enough? I would love to know why. For me, its omission was a disappointing missed opportunity to bring the damned and damning document - the PNAC document, to the attention of the masses.\n\nFool me once shame on, shame on you.  Fool me twice? We won't get fooled again.";Unfit for Command
1114;1217.0;2.0;9.0;"Let me begin by saying that politically speaking, I have historically been a moderate.  So many people let their political views cloud their appreciation of this film--so in my space here, I am going to really try and present the REAL deal about this piece that everyone is making such a fuss over.\n\nI saw this movie to see what everyone was talking about and was curious.  Although it has it's intriguing moments (extra footage and interviews were very interesting to watch) and Moore does have a different sense of humor--I found a lot of the film's content to be, well, false.  Is there anyone else out there who feels/sensed this too?  I've been following the events of 9/11 and politics for some time, so I really find it UNSETTLING that people keep throwing the word ""DOCUMENTARY"" in the mix.  To be called such, I think Moore really SHOULD have spent more time checking facts.  It's a MOVIE!!  Moore is expressing his views on the events that so emotionally charged this country.  I am sure many others out there share his views--and thank goodness we live in a country where freedom of speech and expression is allowed--but that's all this movie is!  He presents what I could only call a deeply biased attack on the Bush Administration (this is, of course, what is popular in today's political arena).  I guess what I am trying to say here is--go see the movie if you are interested because it does have its good points, but do so with the understanding that a lot of his assumptions and statements are not based on truth.  Then again, what in Hollywood IS based in truth/facts?";But is it factual?  Umm... No.

1134;1219.0;4.0;9.0;In order to appreciate 9/11, it is necessary to choose the proper genre.  While a balanced presentation of fact is not required of a documentary, Moore's use of falsehood and innuendo to make his case disqualifies the movie as such.  However, the film succeeds in evoking a high pitch of emotional fervor, ranking it as possibly the best propaganda piece of recent filmdom.  Only the occasionally too-blatant use of mockery in commentary and musical effects keeps this work from measuring up to the German productions of the mid to late 1930's, and denies it a 5th star.;Brilliant propaganda film

What hypocrites they are.\nWhat we have here is left wing version of McCarthyism,this time seeing right wingers under the bed and showing a paranoid attitude to the US Government.\nThis film just gives ammunition to terrorists and,let us not forget,was made by the same man that in the last election told people not to vote for Al Gore.";Michael Moore and his left wing version of McCarthyism.
1170;1221.0;4.0;9.0;"Aside from Moore's arguable politics, his Fahrenheit 9/11 picks up where the superior Bowling For Columbine left off: its investigation of America's burgeoning culture of fear. In a way, Moore's decision to focus on issues of such dramatic political implications (Iraq War, Saudi-American collusion) is unfortunate, because it drowns out some of his less contentious and therefore more cogent observations. His delivery in 9/11 condescends where Bowling for Columbine enlightened; it chokes on its own venom where its predecessor stung with its charm. But what appears to be Moore's central focus -- the culture of fear in America -- remains, albeit it more obscured by the fog of so much agression and self-righteousness. In Bowling for Columbine, Moore drew attention to profound and disturbingly comical distinctions between American news, which is obssessed with violence, impending attack and celebrity worship, and Canadian news, which concerns itself with the new speed bump just laid in front of your local high school. The dangerous sense of threat, paranoia and even apocalypse this engenders in American audiences is not even the most devastating of its consequences. The real misfortune is that this hysteria-rampant journalism distracts millions of Americans from the more local, grassroots news Canadian outlets report: stuff that is happening right in our backyards and is thus of more immediate importance and more susceptible to the efforts and opinions of concerned individuals. One wonders whether the federal government fears that our increasingly technological and media-driven culture is slowly but surely rendering centralized government obsolete and would rather scare us into continued dependence and conformity. Fahrenheit 9/11 powerfully elaborates upon this charge, honing in on the predictable target of the multi-colored terror alert system, a much-criticized tool by which Tom Ridge & Co. allege to inform the public on the potential for terror attacks. Moore does a compelling job of exposing the many conveniences of such a method, particularly its power to distract voters from more local and immediate concerns such as health care, education (America's literacy rate ranks only 49th world-wide!), or growing signs that a reinstatement of the draft is on the horizon. This last issue is surely one that the fed would rather spring on us than debate at the possible expense of frightened or embittered voters. Moore's movie may be heavy-handed and conveniently editted, but it is frequently eloquent and moving in its cinematography, courageous, and, with regard to the culture of fear, enlightening.";The Fear Culture

Like someone saying you are going to die and someone saying wait a minute that is biased I want to hear a lie saying that we might not die.\n\n First off amongst the Western World our proud country is ranked number one in terms of poverty, amount of people without healthcare, amount of citizens that are in jail, amount of pollution being produced etc. While the Dutch are becoming models of the International Labor Organization (ILO)concepts of Flexicurity and Development, and while places like Norway and Sweden have the lowest amount of poverty in the World. In the US while farmers no longer count in the census as 3 companies own and grow almost all the food in America--this form of production has shown to be inefficient as despite the US being world's largest and most powerful agricultural exporter it also has an estimated 30 million people suffering from inadequate diets with the amount of children living in poverty rising by more than 15 percent in the 1980s.\n\n Market led development instead of being efficent--this pattern of development is instead a paradoxical system of rapid growth of food(in the case of food) production leading to perpetual overproduction accompainied by ""reinforcement of social exclusion and thus the growth of hunger"" . (Frederick H. Buttel, 2000). Mean while currently everyone in Cuba is properly fed as small farms have in every case proven to be more efficient allowing for more workers and better distribution of food.\nThis is occuring while, America is currently experiencing massive balance of payments crises, as massive growth of trade surpluses accumulated in Asia and the EU by the year 2000 the U.S. ran up a $430 billion trade deficit while, Western Europe's 350 million consumers increasingly have purchased European made goods (Petras, 2002). As Petras (2002 ) states during the year 2000 ""over 2/3 of EU trade was inter-European"" (p. 294). In Latin America, European MNCs, particularly the Spanish, have outbid U.S. competitors in buying up lucrative privatized enterprises. Meanwhile, the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has been designed to balance out the powers of Europe, has so far been characterized more by exploitation than integration and is not yet a common market (Montezemolo 2000: 4).\n\n While our currency is now only half that of the British pound and while more of Americas public is heavily indebted, according ""The Guardian"" and ""The New York Time"" our military is also spread out and the US not only can not afford proper health care for its soldiers it won't allow anyone to go home even if their contract is through because it is so massively understaffed.\n\n The facts are grim the US is seeing massive unemployment and poverty like nowhere else in the Western world. If there is another side to this it is at least companies like Nestl?, Monsanto, et cetera have still been making huge profits. Which while ? the world population (which includes people living in the US) live on 2 dollars a day, our president won't rest until OPEC stops trying to tax the rich by stopping tax heavens, and god willing He will continue to make the middle class pay for massive subsides which go to a handful of Transnational Coroporations (TNCs) (for farms the latest farm bill was 75 billion dollars to encourage over production as ""The Economist"" reports this has led to the Rocky Mountain's being filled with butter, while many in America go without food).\n\n So there is your second side enjoy, sometimes the truth like DEATH's money is a one sided coin.

Regardless of political beliefs (I am somewhat conservative), I have to say this is one of the most entertaining movies of recent years. Michael Moore has seemingly done the impossible, and that is he got people to talk about and examine politics in the midst of an election year.\n\n Yes, the media is biased on both sides. It doesn't take a Rhodes scholar to understand the motives of the New York Times and the Fox News Channel.\n\n But calling parts of the film outright lies, may be premature, especially considering that certain claims are backed up by the presentation of the documents themselves, i.e. the National Guard Report.\n\n I did want to see more on the alleged business relationships with the bin laden family. That seemed like a missed oppurtunity.\n\n More perplexing, however, was the idea that the Patriot act was so scarcely read. (I only know one senator who admitted to reading it, a republican, no less.)\n\n That's the genius of this film. It raised questions I wouldn't have thought about asking.\n\n The comedic elements were also effective, especially the Hee-Haw themed election coverage and John Ashcroft's absolutely atrocious singing.\n\n Whether you Love Moore or hate him, you will not be able to stop talking about this movie. I'm currently undecided as far as the election goes, but I will definitely be doing more homework leading up to it.\n\n See this movie, if not just to have more to offer in criticism than fat jokes and calling someone a liberal, which seems to have replaced ""Communist"" in political vernacular.\n\n The literal definition of liberal, by the way, is a person who favors change and progress.

There is a school of thought that believes that FDR knew about the Japanese plans to attack Perl Harbor well in advance, and deliberately sacrificed the men who died in that attack for a pretext to get into WW II. Director/writer Moore's film is the same kind of reasoning. It is possible to believe it, and some people probably always will.\nThe Conservative Right has been attacking Moore as a fraud and a hatemonger over this film, and in doing so I think they go at least one level too far. Moore is an angry partisan of the Liberal Far Left, but he has not come completely loose of his wrapping. The truely pathetic Pearl Harbor plot  - mongers believe that FDR ordered the base left defenseless specifically to incite an attack. A similar position is taken by the deranged idiots who maintain that the 9/11 planes were flown by CIA dupes. Moore does not go that far.\nFor myself, as a reader of Von Clauswitz and Machiavelli, I would be greatly conforted if I believed that Bush had plotted to get us into the war on terror, and to justify the invasion of Iraq. Both are clear necessities of statesmanship, if we are to live in a world that is not run by thugs in dish towels. It is periodically necessary to remind the barbarians how unpleasant it can be to annoy their betters. However, since I do not believe that Bush is that cleveer or far sighted, I must reluctantly conclude that Moore is full of dung.;You'll believe or disbelieve, depending on your politics
1347;1232.0;5.0;9.0;Michael is to me one of the most important directors out there today.  This film made me laugh, it made me cry and it had a huge impact on my political views.  As a liberal, i went into the theatre anxious and came out in shock.  Some will complain that the movie was very one-sided, but I think that Moore was aware of this and and some people are too naive to realize that this movie's purpose is to let people see what is going on and what the Bush administration is about.  This is by far the most important film of the summer and I recommend it to everyone, political or not!;Everyone should see it!
1348;1233.0;5.0;9.0;"It is hard to know where to begin reviewing Michael Moore's film.  So much controversy arose prior to its release that it was hard to allow anyone to go into the movie without having a strong bias, either for or against Mr. Moore's actions.  After seeing this film for the third time the most interesting aspect of the experience has not been the actual content of the movie, which if you have read ""Dude Where's My Country"" is already covered, but the reaction of the audience to the actions of the Bush Administration.  Some people have yelled out ""That Bastard!"" after finding out his connections to the Bin Laden family while others were vocal about the disgust they had in the inhumane actions of some of the military personnal in Iraq.  This movie however revealing it may be is probably extremely offensive to many strong republicans for the movie is not only an attack on the Bush Presidency but also the Republicans that got him there and helped pass his agenda.\nStrongly Recommended if you feel that the masses are being subjugated by an elite ruling class in America.";Most important documentary ever.

Did you see how many pepople's lives he's ruined in Iraq? Did you see how many Americans he sent to Iraq to be killed for no reason? What type of person would elect that man to run again to lead this country?;A wonderful and informative movie
1416;1235.0;4.0;9.0;"Fahrenheit 9/11 is a powerful movie which has the potential to change American consciousness. The film represents a milestone for the liberal media and has created a stir which may ultimately effect how people, including Americans, view our Democracy.\nThe movie as a whole isn't nearly as spectacular as the effects it will have. Some of the points are reinforced by examples which seem to have been grasped on a stretch. Moore could have made a much better case against the Patriot Act considering all of the fine examples of its abuse by the American government. Moore could have also mitigated his point, while still leaving it in, about the plane which left the U.S on September 13 carrying the Bin Ladens. Although this was a suspicious action Richard Clarke has clearly shown that it was not a decision made by Bush or his immediate circles.\nThe thesis of the movie is well delivered and supported: These young soldiers, representing mostly the bottom strata of our society, are being sent to Iraq to fight a war that has little to do with the reasons given to fight it. These young people are dying for nothing. They are merely security guards for the huge corporations which seek to benefit from Iraq's resources. The war in Iraq is immoral and represents a huge blemish in the United States' record as a ""leader of the free world.""\nWeighing in all of the positives and negatives, I would still say this is a movie which every American should see, regardless of their opinions going into it.\nI tip my hat to Michael Moore.";The Power of One Movie..
1428;1236.0;5.0;9.0;Ignore the ubiquitous claims of bias that will inevitably come in the next few weeks (and mostly from those already hopelessly biased themselves), ignore the minute dissection of very trivial details that will come from Moore's enemies, for all of these things will completely miss the point.  The fact is that Fahrenheit 911 is an incredible piece of filmmaking, and the emotional impact of the film is staggering.  Personnally, I wept at the end, and I'm not one who cries easily.  Frankly, if you can sit through the last hour of the film and not be moved, then you're probably either dead or else in deep denial.  Kudos to Michael Moore.;An immense achievement
1454;1237.0;5.0;9.0;"Definitely his best work. I was prepared for a weak ending, but he tied it up well (not gonna spoil it). Moore does a great job of presenting complex material, esp. the ties among the companies of the Bushes and the Saudis. Most of this material I already knew, but I had never seen the disturbing footage of Congressmen challenging the Bush ""election""/selection, while all 100 Senators left them hang out to dry. I also never saw the egging of the Presidentail motorcade at his inauguration.  The photos of the Bushes shaking hands with the Saudis were weak (every President has to do that). Some of the best footage came from daily soldiers' lives in Iraq.\nMoore puts together a cogent, tightly constructed argument and supports it well with publicly available video and documents, and surprisingly little of his own invective. He lets the facts speak for themselves, facts any person can verify later.  Well done, Michael. Thank you.\nCan't wait for the DVD, which I hope includes the pile of stuff that you wanted to include, but had to cut in the interest of time.";Just saw it -- one of the best documentaries ever
1470;1238.0;4.0;9.0;"After being totally bowled over (pun intended!) by Michael Moore's last film, Bowling for Columbine, I eagerly awaited the release of Fahrenheit 9/11 and saw the movie on opening day.  The film begins with a recap of the 2000 election, making a strong case for the idea that the President now in office was not the one America elected almost 4 years ago.  It was excruciating to watch Gore presiding over Congress as various African-American democrats of the House of Representatives put forth petitions to oppose the Supreme Court's decision on the election; unfortunately, NOT ONE democratic senator was willing to provide the required signature to contest the judgment of the Supreme Court.  If I found this painful to watch, how must Gore have felt at that time?\n\nFollowing the opening credits, Moore flashes back to the events of September 11th.  In a brilliant film-making decision, Moore has viewers watch a black screen with only the unmistakable sounds of the two planes hitting the World Trade Center in the background.  Even when the images begin, Moore never shows the World Trade Center itself; instead, he focuses on the reactions of New Yorkers at the scene.  I found this entire segment to be incredibly powerful as well as incredibly moving.  During these scenes, the theater in which I sat was filled with utter silence.\n\nUnfortunately, the next section of the movie was a bit less effective, as Moore discussed the connections between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family and detailed the long history of ties between the Bushes and Saudi Arabia.  Although this information is certainly important and relevant, I felt the movie became somewhat bogged down at this point.  However, Moore again heightened the drama as he moved on to the Iraqi war.  Moore speaks out against the war by giving viewers an honest look at the many costs associated with it:  poor Americans deciding to serve our country due to a lack of choices in their own lives, current and former soldiers speaking out against the war, American troops in Iraq making crude references to dead Iraqis, and seemingly innocent Iraqi citizens being led from their houses in the middle of the night.  Of course, the most striking scenes involved injury and death:  maimed American soldiers, disfigured Iraqi civilians, dead Iraqi children.  Moore handles the gruesomeness of war with his usual unexpected grace.\n\nThe final part of the movie centers around a woman from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.  Not being able to send her children to college, she encourages them to consider the many advantages the military has to offer, and she prays for her daughter's safe return from the Gulf War.  With her son and the Iraqi war, however, she is not so lucky, and she speaks openly and movingly of her grief.  The moments she spends in front of the White House sobbing over the loss of her son provide another heart-wrenching viewing experience.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not mention the film's music, as the songs chosen for each scene served to perfectly accentuate each point Moore was trying to make.  Particularly inspired was the use of the Theme from the Greatest American Hero for when Bush was landing on the aircraft carrier to announce ""Mission Accomplished.""  As Joey Scarbury sang ""Suddenly I'm on top of the world--It should have been somebody else,"" the theater erupted with laughter.\n\nAlthough Fahrenheit 9/11 provided a mix of both humourous and sober moments, I felt that Moore did not manage the emotions of his audience as masterfully as he did with Bowling for Columbine.  In addition, even though I agreed completely with his message, I thought he had a tendency to become preachy at times.  Finally, Moore himself has a much smaller on-screen role in this movie than in his earlier films.  This may have been due to the nature of the material, but I felt that the movie lost something as a result:  I believe that Moore's disarming interview techniques with unexpected subjects (such as Marilyn Manson in Bowling for Columbine) produces some of the most memorable moments in his movies.  However, these criticisms are minor and certainly do not detract from the fact that in Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore has created another powerful, intelligent, must-see film.";Extremely compelling

71;1240.0;5.0;8.0;"First, I give this 5 stars because of the subject matter and the subject matter's importance, AND the supplemental interviews and DVD extras; but not for the quality of the documentary filmmaking.  More about that in a moment...\n\nThe subject matter is very, very, deadly serious.  Easily the most important subject matter of this decade and certainly one of the top issues of the last 40 years.  Regardless of whether you consider yourself in one political camp or another, or neutral; you should know that the documentary looks at both individual, very personal concerns such as a mother who lost her son in the war, and also examines much broader, political and economic aspects and questions that deserve attention, and intelligent, calm discussion.\n\n****  Even if you have seen the film and disagree, you should WATCH THE DVD SUPPLEMENTAL footage.  If you miss these additional parts, you are missing 50% of the information.  Please see #2 below\n\nAnd if you are critical of the main documentary's viewpoint, you may welcome the fact that the supplemental material is largely unedited, running footage devoid of any particular viewpoint from the film's authors.\n\nThis documentary well deserves the praise for being one of the first to approach this subject at a time when virtually the entire Western world media would not (or could not) go near this topic.  When national fever is high and any questioning of the war effort is considered ""treason,"" ""unpatriotic,"" and ""morally wrong;"" our constitutional rights such as free speech and free assembly are in serious danger.\n\nThe documentary portrays this, but (unfortunately) only in a sidelight fashion (one of many problems).  In fact, I'm not sure the filmmakers realized this was one of the greatest overriding issues.  If common citizens were better informed, the insane actions and atrocities would have never happened.\n\nYet, the documentary displays this serious, national problem of the absentee press graphically and without any possible misinterpretation.  Both within the US and in other parts of the world, censorship and denial is taking place.  But it doesn't make the points strongly or clearly enough.\n\nBecause this film and its issues have been seen now by tens of millions, it is part of our culture and that effect is growing.  To dismiss it without seeing it in its entirety (plus the supplemental materials!) is going to cast doubt on anyone who tries to discuss the documentary but doesn't know firsthand how the information is presented.  Basically, you can't attack the documentary's ideas unless you watch the documentary.  Hearing about it from your uncle or coworker will not be an acceptable working knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, since these are gigantic political and life-threatening issues, every citizen has a duty to be as informed as possible.  We can't have a country that goes to war, invades another 2 other countries, kills and permanently maims tens of thousands of its own soldiers and tens of thousands of citizens in the other countries, puts another 20,000+ in jail for six+ years, commits acts of torture by the thousands, and then has a substantial part of its own population refuse to consider this as right or wrong, and refuses to spend 2 hours of their time watching a easily available documentary that might shed new light or viewpoints on this situation.\n\nThat being said, Michael Moore's and his filmmaking team's documentary skills and decisions are sometimes good, but other times quite poor.\n\nThis documentary has several problems, and these have nothing to do with facts being correct or other content issues; this is strictly about the documentary filmmaking *process* and the decisions made in the creation of this work.\n\n-- Big Problem #1:\n\nIf you have a film titled ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", don't start the film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities.\n\nAny filmmaker knows that every minute, and every second, of their footage is precious, especially the first 10 minutes.  A documentary on our nationwide election problems is just fine.  But that's another documentary; maybe a really good one, but I don't think it should have been included, except perhaps at the end.\n\nBy starting off with material not directly related to the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Moore has given his critics ample fodder for criticism and rejection in the beginning, even if the reason for that rejection has flaws.\n\nThis decision was a huge presentation blunder, and stole precious resources that could have been used to set up and structure the rest of the material, and prepare the audience for what was ahead.  In its final form, this information is irrelevant to the next 90 minutes and barely remembered after it's all over.\n\n-- Big Problem #2:\n\nAs mentioned above, the filmmakers did not appear to have a good grasp of the subjects they were documenting, and there's no strong sense of what is important and what's not.\n\nThe results are missed opportunities, a barrage of information, and a lack of clarity.  The information is not well organized, and it's not summarized or reviewed at times when a new viewer needs time to catch their breath.  This is a problem with editing and pacing; and understanding how a viewer or audience will mentally keep track of everything.\n\nThat doesn't mean the material is incorrect or faulty, it means it's assembled and presented poorly.  As a comparison, I'd say it was like reading a book by starting with the last chapter, then backing up one chapter at a time.  Sure, you read the book and all the words, but the people, information, story, and connections are going to be a lot harder to put together with that kind of approach.\n\nWe see a lot of really important information.  There's no doubt about that.\n\nBut what are the most important points?  You might name 3, but someone else might name 3 completely different ones.  And both would be right!  However, this shouldn't happen if the documentary is well made.\n\n-- Big Problem #3:\n\nThe film doesn't possess a good structure.\n\nIt's not a particularly linear piece, neither does it follow several simultaneous information or storylines. It doesn't have a ""scientific"" approach or any other good format.  Instead it's an assembly line of data but fails to add up to a finished product, and following this analogy, some information falls off the assembly line and is easily forgotten.  Again, this doesn't mean the data is wrong, this is a mistake of filmmaking; and in all fairness, it's the sort of mistake one would expect from someone not well skilled at creating documentaries.  It's not amateur, but it's not tight and coherent either.\n\nThe material is both dense emotionally explosive, and hard to digest, especially if you aren't familiar with all the facts.  But the presentation doesn't work to help the viewer through this, and connect the many pieces of information or give time for pause and review.  Instead, the presentation is relentless and has a zigzag structure which takes away from the power of the material rather than combine it to something stronger.\n\nFor instance, we see critically important censorship and denial on the part of the media, but it's not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all the other information and data, and neither are the implications of this media black hole.  This needed stronger, more focused presentation. The great crime that a war for ""freedom"" has denied ""freedom of the press"" is very likely lost to many viewers.\n\nAdd to this a seemingly never-ending series of musical jokes and segments, which I can't even guess at their purpose.  Here we are watching this [literally] deadly serious material, and suddenly we have silly rock music and images, like some low-grade music video.  This type of decision is truly amateur and pathetic; and just as shameful as the people being being joked about.  If the documentary filmmakers don't treat the subject with seriousness, how can they ridicule other people?\n\nBut this documentary shouldn't have jokes.  In fact, no ""true documentary"" would ever take this lunatic approach, and this behavior easily opens up the entire subject to ridicule.  It's incomprehensible how any documentary would be created with this type of approach.  Shame on the producers, distributors, and anyone else involved with the production for not stepping forward and ""telling the emperor he has no clothes.""  This juvenile, dimwit approach disgraces the production and insults everyone who has suffered from the craziness of  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  This should never have happened.\n\n-- Big Problem #4:  Every moment of the film should be about runaway crazy ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" but it isn't.\n\nAs an example, President Bush bangs the podium and exclaims the usual nonsense about terrorists hating freedom and hating American goodwill.  So why not show the real reasons?  Like the fact that the United States sold arms to Iran and Iraq as they fought each other years ago, creating immense hostility throughout the Middle East towards the US?  A little information, to either remind or inform the viewer of the real reasons for the hatred goes a long way to proving how we received an endless stream of lies and misleading information about the entire situation.\n\nBetter yet, since you are doing a documentary, why not ask a variety of experts on the subject, and have them explain and agree or disagree with ""terrorists hate America and freedom"".\n\nInstead, precious moments in the documentary are stolen with largely dead or irrelevant material, such as when Michael Moore stands outside the Saudi Embassy with Secret Service coming to ask questions.  It's interesting, but belongs in the supplemental materials section.  That is not something that qualifies as national hysteria or ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  And it opens both Michael Moore and his entire team to criticisms of grandstanding and trying to be performers and part of the story instead of good documentary filmmakers.\n\nHere's one of the most important things you should know:\n\nIn the original film documentary, we see a US military raid on a civilian home suspected to harbor terrorists\n\nTo my utter dismay, we see in the supplemental materials this is part of a much larger story with 10 times as much impact, with disgusting, barbaric and outrageous disrespect for ordinary citizens by our soldiers.  Unfortunately this is lost and jumbled in the original cut.\n\nThe Swedish reporter with the US military unit tells us that no one, including Swedish media, would present this shocking and horrifying behavior.  Furthermore, only the supplemental material lets us have an idea of the type of documentary footage Michael Moore and his team had to work with.  In this well-documented sequence from the Swedish journalists, we see one of our military units invade an ordinary family's home and our soldiers physically and mentally abusing and terrorizing ordinary citizens, including tormenting a crippled old man. Apparently they didn't understand its importance.\n\nTHEN!  ... we find out that one of the soldiers was drunk, and soldiers hit the old man's penis repeatedly, and this all happens with the commanding officer watching calmly to the side.  Why on earth wasn't this included in the main documentary?  This isn't as bad as Abu Ghraib torture sessions, but it's dynamite material nevertheless.\n\nAnd then we are told this is not anything unusual; in fact it's commonplace!\n\nShowing our military behaving like this is extremely important footage, and shows why people in Iraq and the Middle Eastern world have learned to hate the United States more and more each year.  Yet, this crucial segment is poorly presented and largely lost in the original documentary.\n\nCompared to some of the segments mentioned above, this is clearly more important.  But, it was cast aside.  I cannot understand this.\n\nIt's hard to speculate, but if this was left out, we have to ask ourselves what other material has been discarded?  This is, unfortunately, just plain bad decision-making in the documentary process, a real lack of comprehension about on the part of the documentary filmmakers; and poor workmanship compared to other documentary work.\n\n-- Final thoughts:\n\nAt this point you may think my opinion of the documentary is poor and maybe not worth viewing, so let me avoid the film's mistake and summarize this:\n\nThis is an exceedingly serious and important documentary, and I recommend it along with the supplemental materials to anyone who considers himself a good American, of moral conscience, or anyone who has interest in American politics and actions.\n\nYou don't have to agree but you should be familiar with the material and see all of it.\n\nThat's why it gets 5 stars.  You need to watch this.\n\nHowever, I'm very critical of the documentary skill, or lack thereof, and a much better and threfore less controversial documentary could have been created from the same materials, and might have had a more positive impact and received wider acceptance.\n\n  Even so, this needs to be seen.\n\nAnd if you are confused how I can give five stars to something with this many problems, let me repeat that just delving into this subject in the national, political environment of the time of its release was breakthrough and revolutionary.  It would have been ""great"" in the hands of others.";Extremely important subject, tainted by poor film making

94;1242.0;4.0;8.0;"This has to be one of the best documentaries I've seen in years.  After having seen it, I have little doubt that the media will hate it, and that politicians from both parties in power will villify it.\n\nThe film starts off with questions surrounding the 2000 Presidential Election, particularly the media's refusal to question what had happened, and the refusal of Democrats in the Senate to even challenge the actions of the opposition, their own candidates, and the courts.\n\nThe screen then goes to black, and you hear the sounds of the attacks on the World Trade Center.  You'll know what is happening without pictures, trust me.\n\nAfter that, Moore chronicals the events leading up to 9/11, the Administration's perceived lack of action and direction, and the events leading up to and including the war in Iraq.  Moore calls into question actions taken by the federal government to hinder investigations, help the bin Laden family, Saudi involvement in 9/11 and in the decision making processes of our own government, and so forth.\n\nMoore goes on to point out what he sees as the hypocrisy of politicians and the media.  He shows the recruiting tactics of military recruiters who leave wealthy neighborhoods alone while actively targeting poor and minority groups.  He shows the absurdity of media attempts to perpetuate fears, particularly when it benifits the current political leadership.\n\nMoore takes no prisoners, particularly amongst the media.  While many will interpret this film as ""a liberal attack"" on ""conservative values,"" the film really goes after the media as the main culprits behind what Moore sees as the failures of our current government and society.\n\nLove him or hate him, Moore is brilliant.

Now, wouldn't you think with all the communication he has available he could have posponed the reading of ""My Pet Goat"" and headed back to Washington, D.C.  Yes, a straight thinking individual would have done that.  I came out of the theater in shock and grabbed this documentary as soon as it came out on DVD.

124;1246.0;3.0;8.0;"I avoided this documentary for quite some time, particularly due to all the hype over how powerful it was, and from other voices how lame it was.  Well, I finally watched it to discover that I found it to be neither overly powerful or overly lame, but a fairly normal documentary put together much like others, focusing on the Bush family.\n\nIgnoring the Republican/Democrat verbal boxing matches (lets face it folks, there is no discerning the two parties apart any longer, all we have are Republicrats) this documentary did actually have some information that all Americans, regardless of partisanship, should have knowledge of.\n\nMost important, in my opinion, are the Bush/Cheney ties to the Bin Laden family.  Perhaps it is true that they have cut off their black-sheep son Osama, but there was no reason to personally, and at tax-payer expense, fly Bin Laden family members out of the United States before the public caught wind of their presence.\n\nAlso, a personal opinion, is that there should not be that much camaraderie between supposedly ""competitive"" oil sources, meaning American/Eastern oil sources.  If this high-level billionaire club competed more than co-joined, I believe we *might* see lower prices.  No promises though.  But it does seem like a horrible friendship to keep during wartime, which is what makes Moore's presentation of ""hand-shaking"" Bush/Bin Laden pics so funny when presented to the tune of 'Shiny Happy Faces'.  That was a nice touch.\n\nBut the Bush's (both SR and Bubba) oil connections to the Bin Laden's should, IMHO, have been made available to the public long before any elections were held.  Plus, the tie in with the powerful Carlyle Group and their connections to Bush, Bin Laden, Cheney, and the new Middle Eastern Oil Pipeline project (a major project never covered by the media in the USA) should be of interest to everyone.  And, not to surprise anyone, but also Enron's Ken Lay's involvement.\n\nTo me, I found the most humiliating moment of this documentary to be when President Bush addressed attendees of one his high priced political dinners, referring to him and those present as the ""Haves"" and ""Have Mores"".  How smug of a statement to make at an elite mixer while it is the ""Have Nots"" who are dying in his war.  This was the one piece of text, that, IMHO, makes this DVD worth a rent and a watch.  Unbelievable in its arrogance.\n\nThe other alarming item I find with the new Republicrats is that, during the Clinton administration, millions of people died in the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, which was/would have been, a virtuous cause to aid a foreign country; but in the next administration outright war is declared on a country that was unproven to have executed the terrorism, the families of the terrorists were freed, and war was declared against a country that needed much less of our aid than Rwanda, all because they happen to have oil underneath their land.  Would that Rwanda have had oil, or some commodity to interest the 1%-Extreme-Wealth of our planet Earth, perhaps not so many would have died.\n\nAgain, just my two cents.  I believe this film is worth watching as a documentary on war politics (not just Bush or Republican but Past, Present, Future Republicrats) to inform yourself of the behind the scenes schemes of the wealthy and some heart-breaking reality's of the ""Have Nots"" who never made it to Bubba's little dinner party.

133;1248.0;2.0;8.0;For the individual who is well read and keeps up with current events, much of the content on this DVD will not come as a surprise. Moore's documentary argues that the Bush administration not only handled the terrorist attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon in an incompetent manner but that George W. Bush along with members of his family had ties with the individuals who were either directly or indirectly responsible for the 9/11 attacks. The film opens with the aftermath of the 2000 elections and moves on from there. Moore rehashes much of what was already reported on such as Dr. Rice's ignorance regarding the report on Bin Laden submitted to her a month before the attacks. He also rehashes former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke's interview on Good Morning America, after he quit his job, where Clarke elaborates on how the Bush administration was obsessed with linking Iraq and al-Qaida together when in fact no such link ever existed. There are some entertaining parts of the film such as the former phone worker who was questioned by the FBI at his apartment after calling Bush a derogatory name at his local gym which was overheard by another gym member. With the exception of the revelation of Bush's relationship to James R. Bath, much of this won't come as a surprise. If one wants a better in depth look into the 9/11 attacks I recommend picking up a copy of House of Bush-House of Saud by Craig Unger, Superpatriotism by Michael Parenti, and Forbidden Truth (two French authors) which elaborates in detail the U.S. government's early diplomatic relationship with the Taliban regarding establishing a pipeline. Also PBS Frontline put out two excellent specials, which may not be on DVD yet, entitled House of Saud (history of the U.S.--Saudi relationship up to 9/11) and The Man Who Knew which is the story of the late FBI agent John O'Neill and his attempts to foil the 9/11 attacks only to fail due in part to diplomatic red tape and an apathetic U.S. government.;Review of Fahrenheit 9/11
134;1249.0;4.0;8.0;"While I understand that Michael Moore had a skewed agenda in producing this movie, I think a lot of what he has portrayed cannot be ignored.\n\nThe truth is that George W Bush is just as corrupt a politician as most in WA.  He can hide behind ""God"" all he wants but if Jesus came back, he'd be one of the first ones to be thrown out of the temple.\n\nTo think that we as a country are not driven by power and gain is ridiculous.  Of course Bush shelters the Saudi's just like almost every other president has done because we are not in the business to care about freedom unless there is profit to be gained.  We don't invade other countries unless we can get something back for it.  We don't invest in other countries unless it benefits us.\n\nWe have no problem giving weapons to monsters, to use them for our cause, even though time and time again those monsters turn those weapons back on us at a later date.\n\nWe barely fought a war on terroism because of Bush and his Iraq agenda.  People don't like to be lied to and that is where Bush made a mistake.  They concocted a story to get us to back them when the rest of the world wouldn't even back Bush.  I think that if American people truly knew the reasons, agendas, and politcally motivated decision making that takes place in WA everyday, we probably couldn't even handle it.  If we knew the depths of the lies, we couldn't even process it.  It's much easier to trust in our government then to comprehend it's weaknesses.\n\nI would never ever enroll in the military.  I think the govenment is disrespectful of these men and woman who put their life on the line every day for us.  When things go bad over there and our children come home injured beyond repair from chemical warfare etc., our government pretends it didn't happen.  And if you are not a lifer, forget getting help assimilating back into society after you've killed and had to watch war atrocities.  You're on your own and good luck finding a decent job when all you've been trained to do is fire artillery.  We as a country fail these miliary personnel every day.\n\nSo, if it takes a Michael Moore to throw things in our faces to make us want to find out the truth or pay attention to what our pitiful government is concocting, then so be it.

I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why would anybody ever trust us again? Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate John Kerry could not? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about ""his base - also known as the haves and the have mores"". What could have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think this is an important film and is worth viewing - just realize that this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go over the top sometimes.";Good exploration of Iraq war...with  some over-the-top moments

We all know the outcome - Bush won - Kerry lost - and tons of fun raked in millions.\n\nThanks Michael for four more years of Bush.

Another downside to the DVDs is the fact that Morgan Freeman is no longer the narrator of the beloved show, but all of his dialogue has been rerecorded by Jeff Foxworthy so they had to change the name of the show from ""Good Times"" to ""You Might Be a Redneck if and Goodtimesv."" Yes, ""Good Times"" is now spelled ""Goodtimesv"" and I don't know why. I think it might be a typing error as this DVD package was clearly rushed to the shelves and doesn't even feature any special features or audio commentaries.

192;1258.0;5.0;8.0;"Many claimers exist out in our world who are denouncing Michael Moore as idiocy and the father of inaccuracy, but those very comments are clearly hogwash and an attempt to character assassinate Michael Moore. Why they would ""attempt"" to do that to a man who is actually revolutionizing our world with his film, instead of a man, that is Bush, who has almost destroyed our country? Obviously, they have nothing better to do than spout off ""their"" inaccurate claims that he is incorrect. All one needs to do is visit MichaelMoore.com to ""verify"" the supposed ""inaccurate"" facts with news stories and data to backup his claims.\n\nAnother ""true"" erroneous assertion that Bush supporters ""continue"" to make is that ""our"" media is liberal. HA! Have they not seen the partisan documentary ""Free Speech for Sale,"" or ""The Myth of the Liberal Media""? The media in America is far from liberal. The gatekeepers, are almost always white, conservative, and Republicans. Don't believe me, stop being brainwashed by the ""conservative"" media and (again) watch, ""The Myth of The Liberal Media."" Ben Bagdikian's book, ""The Media Monopoly"" is an excellent book talking about how media power ""is"" political power. Hence, the conservative power of the media as gatekeepers to skew, censor or shape news discourse.\n\nRegrettably, Republican ideology generally avoids change that occurs in society and instead pushes for things to ""stay the same,"" or for them to ""go back to the way it used to be."" But if people ""go back"" to the way things used to be, they will again unleash many of society's ills that we continue to desperately fight against. Moreover, I cannot comprehend why anyone would want to re-elect our current Republican president once more. But unfortunately, these buffoons did!\n\nAmong many other things, earlier last year, Bush advocated writing discrimination into the Constitution, he has been handed nearly everything to him in life because of his last name, he cannot sufficiently articulate on par with most other politicians, he continues to push through legislation and tax cuts that benefit the very rich, and he has aligned himself with extreme right-wing organizations and people.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one of the nation's most powerful driving force is deeply embedded into the Republican Party: The Religious Right. Unfortunately, religion has been used for hundreds of years to oppress based on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and religion.\n\nToday, of course, we do not experience the extreme religious fanaticism that occurred centuries ago. Nevertheless, with the Religious Right backed by millions of dollars and millions of faithful followers, they easily continue lobbying their agenda to Washington. As it is now, it is also a very threatening situation when seven of the highest-ranking Republican senators receive a 100 percent scorecard from the right-wing organization, the Christian Coalition.\n\nIn his book, ""The Most Dangerous Man in America?: Pat Robertson and the Rise of the Christian Coalition,"" Robert Boston sheds much light on Robertson's theocratic rhetoric, which threatens the separation of church and state on many interrelated issues. Most absurdly, during an address to the American Center for Law and Justice in 1993, Robertson commented, ""There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore.""\n\nThe author also makes known many of Robertson's sordid actions and claims, which include his ability to communicate with God directly, and the insensitive comments he made shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that were also very similar to Jerry Falwell's. Unfortunately, President Bush has certainly done his part to please the Religious Right. For instance, many will never forget when he appointed extreme right-wing John Ashcroft as our country's attorney general.\n\nRegarding Ashcroft, in my letter-to-the-editor published in the San Antonio Current on Jan. 25, 2001, I said, ""During his time in the Senate, John Ashcroft sponsored unconstitutional legislation violating the Bill of Rights. He is against the Fourth Amendment. He refused to protect abortion clinics from right-wing organizations. He praised Confederate soldiers for fighting to uphold slavery. He blocked the nomination of a gay man for an ambassadorship. He fought federal judgeship of an African American, and blocked efforts to bring an end to racial profiling.""\n\nIn the end, I just want a president who will fight for all civil rights (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and others), be liberal-progressive, have common sense and not cave in to corporate interests. It did not happen last year, and this hopeful reality may be far off in the distance. But like most people who share my sentiment, I will stay optimistic but also realistic, and hope undecided people and people who have been complacent and apathetic to voting in the past, will eventually start to use their power to initiate some change because we definitely need it.\n\nAnd Michael, Michael Moore: God Bless You for making this film. Although Bush is president again, I know God will help us...and these brainwashed people who voted for him...I pray that they will see the light as many of us have already seen it, for years. God keep our country safe from terrorists, ultra-conservative Republicans destroying our country and from complacency and apathy! I have faith!

The opening says the following Interviews and Commentaries are for entertainment, the views and opinions belong to the individual speakers. The film starts by predicting a victory in Florida for Al Gore, then the networks change their projection and declare a Bush victory. Over what time span? [If Gore won his home state of Tennessee he would have been President.] Why did NO US Senator sign on to that petition? Was the fix in? People protested at the Inauguration. Bush was the vacationing President.\n\nOn September 11, 2001 two airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center towers. [Bush looks clueless after receiving the news.] The film asks whether Saudi money went to George W. when his father was President. Were there any other connections? What about the Carlyle Group? The attack on the WTC meant a larger military budget. There are connections between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family. Why did Bush use 9/11 as an excuse to attack Iraq? Can fear be used to scare people and justify government oppression? The FBI knew Al Qaeda had supporters in America who were taking flying lessons. Do Congressmen read the laws before they vote for them?\n\nThe film shows the ""collateral damage"" on the people of Iraq. Brittany Spears trusts Bush, why don't you? The Bush administration said there was no threat from Iraq in 2001. Was this a mistake? Is the high unemployment in parts of America a way to generate troops for the military? Then we see the invasion of a house in Iraq to find a suspect. ""What did he do?"" Why do they hate our troops in Iraq? Why did Bush try to cut wages and benefits for soldiers? Will the bombing of Iraq create business opportunities in rebuilding Iraq? Would Iraq be invaded if there was no oil? Should Congress ask their children to join the Army? These are all good questions.\n\nThere is a quote from George Orwell about the need for war to keep a ruling group in power. Orwell was a cynic, peace is more likely to keep a regime in power. A loss in war usually leads to regime change, as in 1952 and 1968. What about 2008? This film is sort of slow-paced, but that is the result of using facts and not staged events. It provides reports that you won't see on corporate television. After Reagan was elected he raised the lowest tax bracket from 9% to 15%. Social Security taxes were raised by 50%. This allowed the highest tax rate to be cut by 50%. Most people were taxed more so the wealthiest could be taxed less. Real wages fell as well. These economic policies led to today's recession.

Bush's close ties with the Bin Ladens was an eyeopener though. One politician I feel a bit sorry for, who was portrayed as one of Bush's corrupt elite henchmen (ie Dick, Donald, etc), is Colin Powell - he's already expressed regrets over his part in the war, something that Bush and his posse will never do. Also, seeing who the ""American Soldiers"" were fighting over in Iraq (young kids/adults similar if not a bit younger than me) put a new perspective on reports of them being killed or injured (this was the first time I've seen footage of injured soldiers out of Iraq).

However one feels about Michael Moore's in-your-face, unrelenting style, or his facts/research (he was armed to the teeth with researchers and backed up facts this time), the key point of Moore's work (here and in his other films and books) is that he presents his take on issues but does not ask or want viewers/readers to take him at face value.

Taking cheap shots at Dubya may make those who hate him cheer, but it is not particularly compelling for those of us who might actually be trying to remain objective.\n\nThis is basically the same stuff you'll find on Fox News or Rush Limbaugh, just spun in the other direction. Is that helpful?\n\nPost-election, this film loses much of its immediacy.  I agree that Dubya should be out of office, but I seriously doubt Moore's film will change many minds either way. If you already loathe Dubya, you'll love this film. If you support him, you'll end up hating Moore more!\n\nAll the bomb throwing and conspiracy theory spinning reduce the power of his case, reducing it to a joke skit you might see on ""The Daily Show"" or ""Saturday Night Live.""

Hell, even 60 Minutes ran a piece last year about how potentially powerful the evangelicals are, politically, in the US.\n\nThere is a lot of debate going around right now as to what ""neo-conservativism"" really is, and whether or not it actually exists. I don't feel that it's too much of a mystery. Yeah, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, etc. don't carry cards in their wallets saying that they are ""neo-cons,"" nor do they sport neo-con T-shirs under their shirts and ties, nor do they have a secret handshake, but there is a very real movement afoot among them and others like them; and it's purpose is to build a world in America's image: not just a world of democracy and capitalism, but a world that practices these things EXACTLY like America does; no more, no less. The tragic events of 9/11 have given them just cause, as they see it, to say, ""No more, Mr. Nice Guy,"" and bring their ideology ""out of the closet,"" to a greater degree, as if to say to the democrats, and the rest of the world, ""Okay, your way didn't work with these terrorists, so now we're going to do it OUR way""...and, in this way, the 9/11 terrorists gave them exactly the grist they needed for things like a Homeland Security Dept., ""The Patriot Act,"" and the Iraq war.\n\nThere is no question in my mind that fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity is behind the neo-con movement...the only question is to what degree are they fundamentalists themselves, and to what degree are they just pandering to fundamentalist fears and values in order to secure 70,000,000 votes every election. The disorganized democratic party needs to wake up to how much political power the evangelical movement wields and how unified they are in their vision of one nation, and one world, under the Christian god. They are potentially every bit as dangerous as the fundementalist Islamic terrorists that the neo-cons have waged war against, perhaps even more so.\n\nMoore completely misses the religious aspect of the ""war on terrorism,"" making it mostly just about Saudi oil money, and I feel that as much sediment as this movie stirred up, some people just found that a little hard to believe. If he had brought up the whole ""holy war"" aspect of this conflict, it would've brought the wrath of the bible thumpers down on him (although it's hard to imagine that Moore would be intimidated by that), but it probably would've ruffled some more of the RIGHT feathers as well. Furthermore, Moore seems to get a little more ""grandstandy"" with each documentary, driving in thumbtacks with sledgehammers; and I think this tends to appeal more and more to the ""choir"" that's already on his side, and less and less to people on the fence whose minds might otherwise be changed by his movies. The ""ice cream truck loudspeaker"" bit in this movie, might've been a little much, for example. I know some pretty liberal people who think that Michael Moore's getting to be too much of a smart ass. If it gets to the point where too many people ""run and hide when they see you coming"" how effective can you be?\n\nFundamentalist religion, and the corresponding belief that ""man""--as God/Allah's favored species--can do whatever the hell he wants here on earth, is the single biggest threat to humanity...and those of us who can still think for ourselves need to wake up to that fact, while we can still save our civilization.

Moore's film cut made it look like Bush was SERIOUSLY pandering to this group.  He did this throughout the ""Fahrenheit"" mockumentary, and I would recommend that you watch the rebuttal-film, ""FahrenHYPE 9/11,"" to see just how extensively Moore's ""end justifies the means"" philosophy makes an absolute travesty of documentary filmmaking.\n\n""FahrenHYPE"" was hastily put together in only four months after Moore's picture came out, and it has its own over-the-top right wing political ax to grind, but it's quite straightforward with its message, and it doesn't use gimmickry and duplicity to push its pro (2004 pre-election) Iraq war agenda.  If, however, you can get beyond having to watch some clips of the shrill Ann Coulter, and a few others, the film's real value--amounting to well over half its 80 minute length--consists in pointing out the many spliced, diced, and edited fabrications and distortions (lies, really) that Moore used to go after a president who so sorely lacked the intellectual heft, the ecumenical breadth, and the moral gravitas for the job.";Creep!
305;1270.0;3.0;8.0;"I'm not going to claim to be the smartest person when it comes to politics, I'm not. I don't know (and neither do you, fellow reviewers) everything that is going on behind the scenes in America, so I can't really say that what is presented in Michael Moore's highly praised ""Farhenheit 9/11"" is %100 relevant. Afterall, as someone who considers himself to be 100 percent democrat, even I can see that this documentary is lop-sided. From the beginning, it is almost evident that Moore has a personal axe to grind with Dubbya, as displayed early on when the kind gentlemen that is our president, greets Moore with the sentiments ""Get a real job."" But then again, who doesn't have a problem with Bush these days? I have to say, on a personal level, what has happened to America over the past four years, and some of the values Bush stands for, downright piss me off. And the funny part about this movie is, none of the information was surprising to me. It shows Bush as the true moron he is at times, such as when he is doing an interview in a small-town where he says that the people ""don't know the meaning of hard-work"" or in the extra-features, after an interview with the 9/11 Commission, telling the reporters that he talked about ""stuff"" and ""things"" and ""topics."" Not the best P.R. guy, eh? His past is dug into quite a bit here, and not surprisingly, the connections with the Bin Laden family. Make no mistake, there is ample Bush-bashing here. If you're a supporter of the dude, it's gonna infuriate you. But I hardly think Moore is providing us with false information, afterall, his nasal-voiced narration is mainly done over stock footage and interviews, can't really make this stuff up folks (editing my ass). It doesn't have all the answers, or any at all, but let's not make outrageous statements like ""Anti-American"" or simply cutting Moore down by mentioning his weight, something which the average American seems to struggle with. Just watch the movie. Absorb what is presented to you, do more research, and then develop an opinion of your own. I don't take this work as gospel; I knew who I was voting for before this movie came out. Just like I don't need Ben Affleck and Bruce Springsteen to help me make up my mind, I didn't need this movie to do it either. This film and other propaganda, pro or anti-Bush, should be taken with a grain of salt. The people making these films have their own political agendas, and are usually only telling half the side, which is the case with ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" I didn't want Bush as my president, but I don't exactly see him as the embodiment of all evil, just the embodiment of all stupidity (sorry, couldn't help it). But the bottom line is: The film is well-made, and in typical Moore fashion, entertains and informs. Just try to view with an open mind.";Worth Seeing, No Matter What Your Views.
322;1271.0;4.0;8.0;"It seems that a film documentarian has two main jobs. First, to shoot or find some compelling footage that keeps our interest; second, to assemble that footage in a way that tells a larger story or makes a significant point.\n\nMoore has accomplished these two goals in spades, using footage from a wide variety of sources to build a damning case against President George Bush as pertains to the so-called war on terror.\n\nMy main criticism of the film comes from a conflicted frame of mind. On one hand, Moore has exaggerated facts and manipulated situations to such an extent that his film can't be truthfully labeled anything other than propaganda. On the other hand, the propaganda is in line with the daily rants of popular right wing radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. When a liberal like Moore uses extremist methods to build an argument, it balances out their right wing extremism. But it also rings a little false now and again. I guess it's just not possible to have it both ways, but the coloring of the facts did leave me cold at times.\n\n  Highlights of the film include footage of a woman who lost her son in the Iraq war, which left my girlfriend and I wet-eyed. Testimony from US soldiers in Iraq also paints a picture of a majority who have desensitized themselves to the deaths they are causing through the use of bravado, and others who are miserable at the carnage they see around them.\n\n  In another segment, Moore shows the footage of Bush when he is told that the nation is under attack. Rather than respond with authority, Bush sits there for several minutes, reading a storybook to children as part of a promotional visit he had planned. Moore notes that no one told Bush what to do, and that his response was therefore to just sit there. Close ups of his face, slowed down to emphasize a nervous rocking, lead us to wonder what thoughts Bush was thinking, and to conclude that they were probably not the thoughts that we want our leadership to have.\n\n  Also of great interest to me were interviews with Iraqis, which humanized them, and footage of the aggressive recruitment tactics that Marine recruiters use in poor neighborhoods.\n\n  Some of the other segments worked less well for me, and the string of connections between the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia, and big oil was almost boring for me, since I had already read that the ties existed.\n\nThere is one great scene, however, in which Bush is seen joking at a dinner that he is addressing ""the Haves, and the Have-Mores...some people call you the elite; I call you my base."" That is so disgusting.";Powerful, yet funny

If you must see this piece of propoganda, be sure to immediately view the REAL documentary called FarenHYPE 911 right after seeing it. I did and i was shocked at how Michael Moore lied to us. He distorted and fabricated the facts, he lied, he twisted the truths all in the self-serving name of making money to help line his pockets with money and help pay for his 2.5 million dollar condo. This guy is a sham. The fact that the public believes him as if he is some kind of truth-telling god is a sin of the worst kind. I'm glad people are starting to come forward with the truth about how he lies and distorts the facts. Books and articles are being written about him, and they are not flattering at all.  What is scary is that before i saw FarenHYPE 911, i actually believed his movie. Thank-you to the producers of the REAL documentary for shedding light on what a liar he is. He totally dishonored and  disrespected the families of the men and women who fought in the war for his freedom by making his movie. He needs to be stopped. And if you want the truth about his other piece of crap, go to [...]. The only GOOD thing about Farenheit 911 is that Michael's scruffy, obese, over-fed disgusting face and body are seen in the movie for less than five minutes.

Nothing is more eye opening than watching deceptive people being their usual deceptive selves...over and over again. Some highlights: Congress critters scurrying for cover from the unfriendly cameras, businessmen talking about how to divvy up the loot from the occupied Iraq, El Shrubbo talking about ""smoking him out"" and then saying ""I don't care where he is"". And of course Britney Spears showing us that quite a few of the MTV watching airheads NEED to be drafted. Yep, it's a monumental tragi-comedy playing out here as we go from the Florida Fiasco of 2000 to the destruction and desolation of Ground Zero to the ongoing disaster of Afghanistan, which is a brief stop since we are on to bigger and better things in Iraq in no time. Along the way we learn that our country is bankrolled by Saudis, El Shrubbo snorted lines and went AWOL after dodging combat in Vietnam (a perfect role model for his freeper following), and most importantly, many people can be cowed by fear and nationalism into going along with anything someone with an Austrian or Texan accent tells them. Where it really does its damage is when it shows the victims suffering the consequences. As in dead and wounded and those they left behind. The war supporters are up a creek trying to justify those kind of sacrifices for the Big Lie. But this movie is also ultimately inspirational for it shows us that no matter what the next four years hold, we can rest assured knowing the Republic of Palau will be there sacrificing with us every step of the way.";A Political Screed...and a damn good one!
410;1279.0;4.0;8.0;"Although Moore's efforts to get Bush out have failed so far, his film still is a refreshing picture that gives some great insights into the actions of the current USA government. On the other hand, like some other reviewers I think Moore misses out a lot of opportunities to make an even more powerful indictment. Moore makes it appear as if the main goal of the Bush government is oil and business contacts - there may be some truth in that, but this is really an all-too simplistic view. The word neoconservative is not mentioned at all - why not mention the ideology that so strongly drives this cabinet and indict it (which is easy enough), and why not say more about Bush's fundamentalist religious convictions? And on the level of actions - where are Guantanamo Bay and other cases of ignoring the Geneva Charter? These may be some of the most heinous and typical actions of the administration and provide most excellent ammunition for critics - but we do not hear about them.\n\nInstead, Moore spends a large part of the film (about the entire second part) to tell what a misfortunate idea it was to invade Iraq - sure, he's right, but we all know that (well, *many* do). There is the story of a mother who lost her son in the war, which is very moving for sure, but such stories have been in the newspapers and journals all the time. I'd rather see him offering some revealing material (as happens in the first hour) than making a documentary like anyone else does.\n\nCertainly there is a lot positive in Moore's narration about the war, too. The Orwellian quote about war was right spot-on, and if anything Moore convinces you even more that the war in Iraq was a misfortunate idea. Particularly amusing is it when he goes asking conservative Congressmen to let their sons serve in the army - of course their reactions are expectable, but one of them draws such a terrified face when he's asked this (""why, *my* son in the army?""), that he perfectly betrays his own hypocrisy. It is not the rich who sustain this war, as Moore aptly concludes, but mostly the poor ones like those from Flint, Michigan where, due to sheer disinterest of the administration, half the population is without work. Here Moore creates a great image of a government that is so rigorous in foreign policies while it cannot even sustain the situation within its own borders. The same is true for the Oregon coast, where due to budget cuts only one agent can patrol. Does the government actually care about security once the cameras are gone, you will ask yourself. And that while they constantly abuse the ""fear factor"" and have such laws as the Patriot Act that affect the most harmless imaginable citizens.\n\nLike many, I do have my doubts about some of the evidences Moore brings up in the first part of the movie about the Bush family's links to the Saudis and the Bin Ladens. Much of the evidence seems merely suggestive, particularly that of the oil pipeline deal in Afghanistan. It really goes a bit far to suggest, as Moore does, that Hamid Karzai was merely appointed because of his business contacts. But even if only a small part of the entire story is true (which I'm sure of) then Bush has quite something to explain. Particularly convincing is the part that narrates about the contacts of Saudi oil sheiks with companies Bush ruled (and ruined) in the 80's, and the dependence of the USA on Saudi investors - how can you act against the Saudis if they're such good friends of yours and effectively own 7% of the country? Again, there is a great hypocrisy in all this, and that is what Moore brings out so well during the entire movie. It is unfortunate that he feels the need to exaggerate things so often, since (as another reviewer aptly observed) the mere facts are saying enough. That, and Moore's reluctance to touch some of the Bush administration's most controversial actions keep this from being a 5-star film.\n\nFinally, it seems to have become fashion to say that the Democrats lost due to their total disrespect towards Bush, and that Moore is the best example of this attitude. What sense does this make? As if the Republicans have always been so flattering towards their opponents, and as if O'Reilly is such a nice guy. Sure.";Convincing, but could have been better
429;1280.0;2.0;8.0;"I suppose the reason SNL and Jay Leno are funnier in their spoofs on politics is because they are intentionally funny. The humor in this, and others such as ""Bowling for Columbine"" are funny only in the serious play on the ironic -- remember the bank giving away free guns with a new account? But in this the issue is not guns, but the use of serious irony in interpreting political action. The target audience, those that like it, I think need no persuasion. They cheer the movie because it presents their point of view. Perhaps little else in movies does. Those that do not share the point of view react with horror. Isn't this a Straw Man argument? Putting supposed thoughts in someone's head while they sit in a class room is not science or fact especially when the information given suggests guilt by association. Who else did business with the Bin Ladens? IBM? How much gas have you used in your car? So who are the merely foolish for watching this? Those that watch this for the entertainment value are not entertained since it pretends to be too serious. They may only get angry.

In fact, Mr. Moore has a clean slate with me since I haven't seen any other movies of his either. What propels me to write a comment anyway is the content (or lack thereof) of many of the negative reviews presented here. Why do so many reviewers have to resort to name calling and insults? Why are so few negative reviews containing any substance, i.e., factual contradiction of the opinions expressed in the movie? Mr. Moore must have made at least that much of an attempt to present what are facts in his mind, otherwise it would have been a pretty short movie!\n\nOne cannot help but wonder - simply because of the lack of factual rebuttal - if there isn't more truth than fiction to the movie. However, whether one agrees or disagrees with the movie's theories, likes or dislikes Moore's opinions, name calling and insults are inappropriate! It is downright scary, given their vast number, that those people who resort to such inappropriateness are exactly those that declare they support Mr. Bush. Even if one knew nothing about Mr. Bush, wouldn't one have to wonder what kind of person or leader he might be if he appeals so strongly to people who demonstrate such poor judgement when it comes to inappropriate behavior and, by extrapolation, values and ethics?\n\nEven if this movie were to be based on nothing but lies and misrepresentation of facts, the simple fact that it accomplishes to reveal this particular character flaw, if you will, in a great number of its opponents DOES make it an excellent movie in my opinion!!

The Carlyle Group, a military supplies group of which George Bush Sr. was a major affiliate of, was in the process of creating a missile program that would benefit the both the Bush family and the Saudi family when if it was sold to the military. However, this missile program was actually cancelled by the Bush Administration. Kinda hard to get money out of a cancelled program.\n\n3.

Fox News, however, called the state for Gore during the first count.\n\n4. Mr. Moore implies that Iraq was a nice country. I mean, doesn't kids playing in the local parks show that? Come on, Mike. Saddam killed 1 Million of his own people. Do you think that 900 American lives can compete with that?

Rarely is the most effective way to gain votes for a particular candidate to actually cater to undecideds by rationally convincing them to vote for the desired candidate.  Rather, it's to energize those that already support the candidate in question to actually get out and vote.  As such, the movie does an excellent job energzing Kerry Supporters to get angry enough at Bush to vote, and in some cases, actually get involved in the campaign.\n\nIfyou're an undecided voter looking for rational guidance, this movie is clearly not for you.  No one that either already likes Bush or is undecided is going to see anything compelling here -- far too much of the movie is intentionally biased and overtly presented in a way as to deliberately make Bush look worse than he deserves (which is quite an accomplishment, since he is quite adept at making himself look terrible without any outside help).  This movie is quite humorous in the process, so it definitely earns high marks as a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  However, it earns poor marks for actual informational value -- which is of concern in a movie that bills itself as a documentary, and why I docked it a star.  This movie will make Kerry supporters mad enough that they'll be more likely to vote, but won't actually cause anyone to learn anything they didn't already know or believe anything they didn't already believe.\n\nSee this movie cause it's fun, and, if you're liberal, to get energized.

1214;1298.0;5.0;8.0;This is a powerful movie. No matter your political leanings, there are core truths in the movie that I found indisputable. There's no faking a mother's grief, whether in Flint, Michigan or in Baghdad, Iraq, no way around the horror of 9/11 itself, no getting around George W. Bush's seven minutes of 'deer in the headlights stare' in that Florida classroom.\n\nMy biggest reaction to seeing the film was the shock of realization of how much our news media censors itself. From Al Gore gaveling down members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the near riot during Bush's drive down Penn. Ave. at the 2000 inauguration, to the suffering of Iraqi civilians and American soldiers: Why is this the first time I've ever seen this footage?\n\nIt's sad that America never had a proper debate about the Iraq war, as we had for the Gulf War (one of Congress' finest hours, IMO). Moore's movie is a catylst for that debate now. I just hope it isn't too late.

If you ever wanted to know what patriotic freedom looks like, Michael Moore's montage of news footage, TV reports, interviews, and speeches is a profound example.  I was surprised at my reaction throughout the film, tears streamed, as my internal dialogue went in to overtime.  Why was I crying?  I think firstly, I was so proud to live in a country where we can both air ""Dirty laundry"" and honor our fallen soldiers and the victims of 911 in the same forum.  Next, I cried at the thought that the world it seems, will know that we are not ""ugly Americans"" simply apathetic and politically lethargic. Michael Moore had two plus hours to awaken the sleeping optimist, revive civic consciousness and renew interest in affairs of state.  His intention is clear, provocatively precise and to the point ... to exercise the First Amendment unabashedly; and he did.  Mr. Moore has the whole town talking and more importantly thinking!

If you are someone who is undecided on who to vote for than you must see this film and even if you support bush or don't support bush this is a must see. In this film Michael Moore shows how this country went down hill ever since bush made it into office and how the war on terror is all just a war for oil. This movie will take you through ever emotion from sad to happy and everything in between. Some may not agree with what i have to say but I have one last thing to say and that is "" Clinton lied but nobody died!!!""  -Daniel Damnation";Thank you Michael Moore for the TRUTH!!!!
1432;1304.0;5.0;8.0;Michael Moore did his homework. This film is a real shocker and eye-opener. It amazes me as to how Moore got a hold of exclusive footage. I recommend this film to everyone, even if you like Bush. The media always tries to show one side of things and F911 attempts to show the other side that never makes it to our television sets. This will make you experience all emotions within one sitting: frustration, anger, relief, and sadness. One thing is for sure, once you see this film, you will not want this fool to be your president for the next four years. What good has he successfully brought to our nation during his time in office? What? NOTHING? If anything, he is the weapon of mass destruction.;"""Once a fool, shame on you."""

1456;1306.0;4.0;8.0;"This is not a documentary. It's a mostly truthful, but bias look at the Bush administration. Most of this film deals with the Bush family connection to terrorist funding saudis, the Bush response to 911, and the Iraq war.\nI admit that this movie is very emotional. The first part I cried at was a clip of George W Bush reading to a group of children in Florida on the morning of 911. In the clip he is told about both planes hitting the towers. You would think as president that he would spring into action and get on the phone, but instead he sits in the class room like some sort of moron. The most emotional part of the film deals with the unnecessary human suffering of the Iraq war. Everything from clear footage of operation Shock and Awe, amputated US troops, and the families of dead US troops is troubling and sad to watch.\nFor a film that covers a very serious subject, I didn't like some of the sarcastic humor in this film(such as making fun of the coalition members). I also don't like how Moore edited the film to fit his agenda. For example: There is a part of the film where moore is talking to members of congress about sending their kids to Iraq. One of the congressman told Moore that his nephew was serving in Iraq, which is cut out of the film. What is shown is the congressmans reaction to the question before he answered(which made him look bad). Tricks like that are not neccessary, especially when your dealing with the Bush administration. They create enough bad news; no need to make things up...";Every American should see this film at least one time
1459;1307.0;5.0;8.0;The film is a well-organized gathering of information - most of which I knew but with a few nasty surprises. Whether you think of yourself as patriot or nationalist, whether intelligent or just  having common-sense, I don't think you can honestly complain about partisanship here. If the editing helps make a point Moore clear, it pretty much follows independently verifiable facts. We know from past experience that when government tries this hard to censor and control information it's pretty deep in the muck. Moore actually just  compares and contrasts excerpts from the Administration's own movies pretending to be History in the Making - e.g.: the Mission Accomplished banner on the aircraft carrier (haven't more people died since that stunt than had before), the constant, non-stop, repeated insistence that Saddam and Osama are buddies (Bots in the White House?) - and this, along with the breathtaking arrogance of these leaders, is what makes the film so hair-raising. The grief is not over -  its worse than ever now that our own government has been hijacked.;"Pay attention; stay alive"
1474;1308.0;5.0;8.0;I am really annoyed by the fact that the media in the US has had so many efforts to discredit this movie. Actually, it is one of the most important and relevant pieces of film ever made. Unlike Moore's previous work, his personal interventions are reduced to a surprising minimum and the material speaks for itself. We all know that the movie expresses a liberal point of view. However, if only 1/5 of the material showed there was true, it would be enough to reconsider many political positions (and BTW, regardless of what Fox News says, the movies is quite accurate in many things). I would say that regardless of your political affiliation, you should see this movie. If you are a Democrat or a Liberal, it will give you more reasons to be politically active. If you are a conservative or a Republican, it is a personal responsibility to watch this, digest it, criticize it and assume the full consequences of your vote. It is not about convincing or propaganda. It is about putting in the table matters of the utmost important in the year when they matter the most. My respect and recognition to Moore for his bravery. I invite all viewers to leave aside the hype of the movie, watch it because of its importance and make your own mind about it. A democracy is about debate and discussion, and not about media punditry.;An important film
1475;1309.0;5.0;8.0;"If I were judging Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" strictly for its quality, I would give it four stars rather than five. It meanders too much in its mid-section, as Moore simply goes on too long with his polemics about President Bush and his ties to the bin Laden family and other wealthy Saudis. ""Bowling for Columbine"" had a more concentrated impact and took (or at least seemed to take) fewer cheap shots. But for historical importance, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" flies off the charts in a way that few films in history ever have. Is Moore preaching to the anti-Bush choir here? Of course, but he does so in a way that his opponents cannot afford to ignore--in a way that Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe preached against slavery in the 1850s. That's because Moore's essential purpose is bigger than simply to bash Bush; once Moore gets to the war in Iraq, he sweeps away all criticism in a heartbreaking, horrifying depiction of the carnage of war. (Warning: Moore does not flinch from showing the burned, mangled bodies of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians, so the squeamish should stay away.) The film's most heartbreaking section depicts Lila Lipscomb--a nice, upright, patriotic mom from Moore's home town of Flint, Mich., who slowly succumbs to grief and despair as she comes to the realization that her son died fighting an unnecessary, ill-conceived war. (Some have accused Moore of using Lipscomb for propaganda purposes. Did he? Perhaps. But Lipscomb clearly wanted her story to be told.) Of course Moore wouldn't be Moore without a few merry pranks. At one point, finding out that none of the senators who voted for the Patriot Act had actually read it, he rents an ice cream truck and rides around Capitol Hill reading the bill's text over the truck's loudspeaker. A little later, he and a disillusioned young Marine walk around Capitol Hill, trying to get congressmen to sign their children up for military service in Iraq. But those merry pranks, as always, have a point as deadly serious as the war footage. You can quibble with specific points of this movie, and it can't be taken as straight reporting. But as an ""op-ed piece,"" as Moore himself calls it, it makes a very persuasive case that our current president and his Cabinet have been led by greed, stupidity and vanity into making grievous errors of judgment that emperil this country. This is an unforgettable portrait of a moment in American history, etched in acid, tears, and blood.";Not a perfect movie, but an extraordinarily important one.
1479;1310.0;5.0;8.0;"I left the movie theater thinking that I'd been mugged.  This movie made me cry a lot at what's being done in my name and with my tax dollars.  I was able to laugh a little -- thankfully -- because Michael Moore can find irony and wry humor in even the most horrifying events.  The winners in the movie are (1) the average Iraqi people who are presented as human beings with lives and feelings and loved ones, and (2) the American G.I.s who may be able to come home a month or two early IF the American people wake up.  The big loser in the movie is George W. Bush because maybe, just maybe, the conservative Republicans will begin asking questions before election day IF they see this movie.\nThe two saddest parts of the movie for me were (1) the happiness and joy of the Iraqis in Baghdad before Bush started bombing them to kingdom come, and (2) the mother near the White House being challenged by a right wing nut case about the death of her son in Iraq.  The destruction of the Twin Towers was handled in a deeply sensitive way, and the sound of the bombs over Baghdad made me shake in my shoes.  The movie theater was packed to overflowing, but you could hear a pin drop when the United States of America began killing the people of Iraq.  Sad.\nBush was made to look like the clown that he is, but Michael Moore could have left ""W"" out of the movie completely, and I would have been equally devastated.

Bush's presidency, if you care about your country, dare to make yourself uncomfortable for an evening - to weep with the Americans and Iraqis who have lost their loved ones, then be shocked into outraged laughter a moment later.\nMichael Moore certainly isn't attempting to present us with an unbiased view. He is attempting to send a wake-up call to America, to remind us of the recent events and connections that have been glossed over, re-interpreted, and just plain denied by the current administration and the news media. And with an astonishingly hard-hitting mix of news footage, behind-the-scenes outtakes, and candid interviews, ingeniously accompanied by a catchy soundtrack, Moore is asking us to stand up in November and take our country back.;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
57;1313.0;3.0;7.0;Some people would consider this movie a documentary, especially many in Hollywood.  It is more of an editorial than a documentary in that it takes certain facts from a large body of information, and uses it to argue several viewpoints.  These are that the Bush administration did not take seriously warnings about the threat of Al Queda, the Bush administration did not react fast enough or with enough power to destroy the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Bush administration mistakenly went after Saddam Hussein, and had been planning this for a while, and that the Bush administration's ties with the Saudi royal family is biasing them from really going after the threat of Al Queda and those within Saudi Arabia who support it.  Each of these points is argued in other movies, documentary shows, magazine articles and books.  Examples of the latter are referenced occasionally in this movie.  What this movie does is pull many of these sources together, and present them in a cogent manner.  What the movie fails at is to put forward a sense of objectivity.  From the get-go, the audience can clearly tell that Mr. Moore has no liking of G. W. Bush.  The movie makes little attempt to explain the reasoning of the president or his advisers.  Because of this, the arguments of this movie should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nThis movie was released in 2003 after the Iraq War began, and the DVD came out in 2004, probably in hopes of affecting the US national elections.  The election did not turn out as Mr. Moore had hoped, but the failures of the US occupation of Iraq, and the resurgence of the Taliban can only lend credence to the points of this movie.;Lots of good points, but overly biased

Long before it was fashionable, long before most of the country woke up and realized how harmful and unnecessary the Iraq war is, Michael Moore was a powerful (and often lone) voice that spoke truth to power.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 is not only a must-see film because of its relevance. It's also witty, engaging and very often funny. That Michael Moore manages to take such serious material and put it into a context that makes for a riveting documentary shows that, as a filmmaker, he's second to none.\n\nAfter Katrina, I heard a lot of people who tried to avoid blame for having voted for Bush saying that they didn't know, they couldn't imagine how bad he would be, they thought the was right about the war, blah, blah, blah. Well, screw them. Fahrenheit 9/11 was out there, proving beyond any doubt that emperor Bush has no clothes.

83;1319.0;1.0;7.0;"The problem with Michael Moore's movies is that he's got an agenda to push. Forget about offering counter arguments. Case in point: Fahrenheit 9/11. This movie is chuck full of clips taken entirely out of context and purposely made to look George Bush stupid with ""dumb music"" playing in the background. There are clips that are supposed to show the President's ineffectiveness but they are utterly pointless. Let's take the scene where George Bush is at the elementary school and he's told the news about the Twin Towers by his secret service agent. The President continues to sit in the classroom listening to the child who's talking. I suppose that the purpose of this scene is to show how idiotic the President was by not reacting. Firstly, we don't know what the President was told exactly. No one knew at the time that the attack on the Twin Towers was a terrorist act. Secondly, what exactly did Moore expect the President to do? Panic and leave? Tell the child who's speaking to stop and run out? What he did instead was to do what we would expect a President to do during a time of crisis: he kept his cool and left the school without raising any alarms in front of little children. There is another clip where the President says that he's not concerned about Osama Bin-Laden. Again, this clip was taken out of context. The President has said repeatedly that he's not interested in individuals in the axis of terror but the entire network.\n\nWhether or not you're a George W. Bush fan, Michael Moore's work is here to appeal to our emotions and spin the facts. This movie deserves zero stars.";Pushing an agenda
84;1320.0;1.0;7.0;"He sharpened his propaganda sword in ""Bowling for Columbine"". Then he gained 700 pounds and made ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". If this film carried a fraction the weight of Moore himself it would be a substantial film indeed.\n\n""There is no terrorist threat!"" That is a direct quote from Michael Moore. I swear I am not making that up!!! I have seen him on TV saying those exact words; if you have doubts check out his biography on the IMDB. They credit that quote to him as well. To be fair, I don't know whether he said that before or after 9/11 but it really dosen't matter. Either way it shows a profound disconnection with reality, and you can be sure that this film is entirely colored with the same type of rhetoric. Here is another typical Moore quote. ""The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not 'insurgents' or 'terrorists' or 'The Enemy.' They are the Revolution, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow, and they will win.'' Its almost impossible to believe he actually said that. If stupidity was a sport he would be olympic champion. They are not insurgents or terrorists? Let me tell you, if I were a terrorist and I had to pick my campaign manager, Moore would be my first choice. These quotes don't have anything to do with the movie in and of themselves, but you need to see what Michael Moore really believes to put the film into some sort of context.\n\nWhat Moore is doing in this film is nothing new and its really very simple. His film uses tricks that date back even before the great Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl. Moore is merely using clever editing and movie magic to completely manipulate the truth. Moore has theories but no facts to back them up; so what does he do? He goes out and completely fabricates the facts. What you as the viewer has to decide is: Do I care that Moore gets his point across, even if it's in a dishonest way? I personally don't like to be lied to; you may feel differently though.\n\nJean-Luc Godard the famous filmmaker and founding member of the French new wave said of Moore: ""Post-war filmmakers gave us the documentary, Rob Reiner gave us the mockumentary and Moore initiated a third genre, the crockumentary."" I didn't say that; a French filmmaker did. Now if a Frenchman (they are generally very anti-war/Bush) can see through the lies of this film, it shouldn't be a problem for any American to do the same.\n\nDon't get me wrong, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a pack of boldface lies and manipulations but if you watch carefully you will see upon closer inspection that Michael Moore is, in fact, enormously fat.\n\nThis film is cleverly edited for sure; you have to give Moore credit for that. But it is not honest in any way.\n\nI can hardly wait for ""Fahrenheit 9/11 """;Propaganda extraordinaire
18;1321.0;5.0;6.0;"In Fahrenheit 9/11 the strange relationship between the Bush family and the Bin Laden's is exposed.  Both families had interests in the Carlyle Group, one of the major arms suppliers of the US military.  That partially explains how it was possible that 24 family members of the Bin Laden's were flying to their home country after the attacks, the only planes officially permitted to fly at that time by... the White House...  All other planes were kept on the ground.  An ex-FBI agent claims this to be totally absurd.  If you have a suspected murderer, you first talk to whoever is close to him, family members first.  That's what any cop would do.  Why didn't president Bush let this happen ?  Was he afraid something could have been revealed?\n\nThis picture also shows there never really was any serious effort to find the suspected ""Bad Guy"", Osama bin Laden.  It took the US military two months to start looking after him, sending only 11.000 troops to Afghanistan, just enough to have a new president in office, who helped US corporations in to build a new pipeline.  The search on Osama bin Laden was stopped before it ever began.  In this picture, you will literally hear Bush say : ""I don't know where he is and don't want to spend much time on it"".  So here we had the biggest ""foreign attack"" on the US, performed by 15 Saudi's, under alleged orders of Osama Bin Laden, and Bush doesn't care !?  Probably because either he had nothing to do with the attacks, or worse, because it would have been too dangerous for him telling the full truth, should they ever have captured him alive.  We must never forget Bin Laden was a CIA-man.  And the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.\n\nAlthough Bush doesn't care finding Bin Laden, he insists in fighting a ""war on terror"" !  Who are the enemies then ?  Well, it seems that YOU are, or maybe I am.  After 9/11 everybody suddenly became a possible ""suspect"".  A Fresno peace group was infiltrated by a secret service agent !  A retired man going to a gym was visited afterward by the FBI (!) because he made a casual remark on Bush.  And at airports breast milk was considered suspect.  This ""war on terror"" was above all a war on the liberties of the American people, although it's called, with a certain irony, the ""Patriot Act"".  And the American people believed it.  The objective was having the American people to turn to their ""leader"" to protect them.  But protect them from who ?  The most dangerous men at that time had their office in the White House.  They were the ""leaders"" - like Cheney and Rumsfeld.  And in this atmosphere of fear the war on Iraq was started, in March 2003, when Iraq had nothing whatsoever to do with the alleged ""foreign attack"" on 9/11.  Rumsfeld says in this movie, after you see some images of dead babies, children, women and men in Iraq, that the military puts ""a lot of humanity in the war effort"".  I don't believe in God, but Rumsfeld does give me a pretty good idea of what the Devil looks like !";The republic of fear

98;1323.0;4.0;7.0;This film comes from a very biased viewpoint and should be taken as such.  This is no different than listening to Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  Moore tries to present his viewpoint in a humerous entertaining way and that is hit or miss.  I don't like his stunts such as getting Congresspeople to enlist their children.  I think that detracts from his narrative and it isn't that entertaining.  What I think most people should look at is that it is not 'liberal' to question the government's motives.  I lived through the 60's where civil rights participants were followed and bugged for years.  These people were in peaceful groups and did not use violence.  What a waste of resources, especially when the FBI and CIA could have been following the violent racist groups dedicated to making the white race supreme.  Now the government sees antiwar protesters as enemies of the state.  This deserves attention.  Also the Bush administration ties to Saudi business interests should be closely investigated.  We have lost billions due to the protection of Haliburton.  That money is not going to rebuilding Iraq nor protecting our troops.  Can you get any more unpatriotic than that?  Anyway Moore's points are valid, even if he goes overboard on the issues.  His facts are not always correct which detracts from his message.  He should tighten up his narrative so that people who don't agree with him would at least try to delve into the criticisms.  My professor told us to read newspapers/magazines from all points of views. You can't be a critical thinker without seeing opposing views.

128;1327.0;4.0;7.0;Propaganda or the Truth?\n\nAfter watching Fahrenheit 9/11, I was deeply shocked by the matters that were brought to the attention of the world.  It is more of a reality shock which some of us are too naive to realise the actual truth in what is going on the USA.  Moore possesses an incredibly charismatic way of depicting the truth and goes about it by creating a documentary film with all the facts in front of our very eyes.  Moore ironically portrays Bush as a lying, deceitful man who possesses no integrity and would do anything to remain in power.  He also shows Bush as having a low level of intelligence and that he cannot cope in such a high position without his advisors whom he relies on considerably.  He is portrayed as incapable of thinking anything for himself, a view which I think is upheld by most people.  Michael Moore reveals `secrets' that we do not know about politicians and uses documents as proof.  He felt that we all had a right to know and disclosed this to the world.  He shows us what the media may not necessarily show and this is why Fahrenheit 9/11 is truly exceptional in terms of quality and content.\n\nMichael Moore uses many techniques in Fahrenheit 9/11, which work to strongly to expose George Bush as he really is.  He uses cuts to manipulate what George Bush is saying, uses emotive language and shows parents mourning over the loss of their children to gain the sympathy of the viewer and feel a strong anger towards Bush.  An example of how he uses cuts is when he may show the war in Iraq and burnt bodies being thrown in the back of a truck and then cut to Bush on holiday, which leaves people in shock thinking `how could he do that?' and that is exactly what Moore's intentions are.\n\nMichael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 was released in 2004 before the election with the intention of people voting against George W. Bush.  For those who are opposed to Bush and his principles believe to an extent what Michael Moore is saying is true even before Fahrenheit 9/11 was released, their views on Bush may be now have been further enhanced.  On the other hand, people who are in favour of Bush may be unaware and shocked at some of the material Michael Moore exposes in Fahrenheit 9/11, but they nevertheless remain supportive of Bush.\n\nIt can be argued that Fahrenheit 9/11 is too biased, however, Moore is only human and we all are capable of having a biased view on one thing or another.  If Moore were to show the Bush's more favourable side, then perhaps more people would appreciate the argument that he is trying to portray.  Nevertheless, Michael Moore did what he thought was best and expressed it passionately and he certainly did not care what people may think and I respect him for that.  I also respect him for creating such a documentary on the most powerful man in the world and not worrying about the repercussions.\n\nHuni\n\n(Harjinder Khaira);Propaganda or the Truth?
153;1328.0;1.0;7.0;It strikes me as extremely odd that anyone can hate Bush that much. Oh, all right, we all have our idiosyncrasies, but this just tops it all. The very fact that Moore is willing to waste so much time and money one one president is just pointless.\n\nI must admit, the information was presented very well. But it wa so carefully edited you started feeling that no one, and I mean no one, can be that bad. Also, I got a distinct feeling that too many of Bush's speeches were taken out of context in an attempt to ridicule him.\n\n  I was also slighlty disturbed by some images shown in this movie. I have major problems with anyone using human pain to further his own cause, something that was done repeatedly and effectively in this movie. For instance, the images frm 9/11 were meant to channel your anger towards a carefully presented target-Bush.\n\n  This  is an imformative movie, so long as you think for youurself and realize that this is just about as biased as it gets.;Pathetic!

176;1330.0;5.0;7.0;"+++++\n\nThis movie documentary that was written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore looks at the role played by money and oil after the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  The majority of the movie contains archival news footage with Moore narrating but there are some interviews.  This is balanced with Moore's own brand of humor and satire.\n\nIt's title comes from the 1953 novel entitled ""Fahrenheit 451"" that depicts a society where independent thinking is discouraged and books are burned.  (451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that's needed for paper to burn.)\n\nThis movie was written and released just before George W. Bush's re-election in 2004 as president of the United States.\n\nThe end credits of this documentary reveal who it is dedicated too:\n\n""This film is dedicated to...all the soldiers from the Flint [Michigan] area who have died in the Iraq war...the 2,973 who died on 9/11/01 and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our [that is, the American government's] actions.""\n\nAs a very brief overview, this movie begins with the strange events that occurred during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush.  Then we hear and see the horrors of September 11, 2001 and the president's response to these horrors.  From here, the documentary tells and shows us key things with respect to the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war.  The movie ends with a ""Congressional Recruitment"" by Moore.\n\nMoore also has some candid interviews in the movie.  Most revealing is the interview with a serviceman that had recently returned from Iraq.  When asked if he'd return to Iraq if asked he said ""No"" even if this decision meant ""possible jail time.""  His reason:\n\n""I will not let anyone send me back over there to kill other poor people [e]specially when they pose no threat to me and my country...I won't do it.""\n\nAs I mentioned above, the majority of this documentary contains archival news footage, some of it graphic.  Despite Moore's occasional narration, this footage speaks for itself.  (I found it helpful to turn on the English subtitles when viewing this movie.)\n\nOf all this footage, one thing stood out for me: when Bush referred to himself as the ""war president.""\n\nWho will you see or hear in this documentary?

181;1331.0;5.0;7.0;"The above quote, from George Orwell's fictional book ""1984"" that was published at the onset of the Cold War in 1949, is a sad commentary quoted in Michael Moore's 2004 documentary entitled ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  The book, which depicts a dystopian society that is always at war that is never meant to be won, is used as a comparison by Michael Moore with the current state of affairs by the U.S. Government.  The documentary begins with a brief look at the highly questionable results of the 2000 presidential election that permitted with the candidate with the fewer number of popular votes, George W. Bush, to become president of the United States.  While on a very lengthy vacation at his ranch in Crawford, Texas in August, 2001, Mr. Bush ignored U.S. Government warnings about a potential terrorist attack that would use hijacked airplanes only weeks before the dreaded terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 that saw the destruction of the World Trade Center in NYC, an attack on the Pentagon and leaving about 3000 people dead.  The notion that all domestic flights in the U.S. were grounded immediately after the attack is incorrect, as a number of secret flights carrying Saudi citizens (including blood relatives of Osama bin Laden, the man responsible for the attack) were allowed to leave the U.S.  Hence, Mr. Bush ensured that even though 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001 were Saudi citizens, no departing Saudi citizens could be questioned by U.S. law enforcement officials that were investigating the horrific attack.\n\nWithin weeks of the attack and Americans living in fear, it was then easy for Mr. Bush and his White House staff to promote the Patriot Act (especially former Attorney General John Ashcroft), which reduced the rights, freedoms and privacy of all Americans and the Taliban-controlled nation of Afghanistan was attacked by U.S. forces to weed out al Queda terrorists.  However, as Michael Moore points out in his documentary, some officials in Bush's administration wanted a bigger target to attack, and the preferred choice was Iraq.  In less than a year, Mr. Bush and other White House officials were repeatedly calling for an invasion into Iraq; and on March 19, 2003, they got their wish as U.S. forces did invade that nation, which had never attacked the U.S. The justification used by Mr. Bush and other White House officials to invade Iraq was the claim that its former regime possessed weapons of mass destruction in violation of United Nations resolutions.  However, in the months following the invasion, no such weapons were ever found, nor were any facilities found where any such weapons could be built.  In other words, Mr. Bush lied in order to justify the sending of thousands of U.S. troops into harms way in costly war.  Since the invasion (at the time of writing this review), over 1870 American military servicemen and servicewomen have died, over 14000 have been wounded and an estimated 23000 to 25000 Iraqi civilians have been killed.  It is interesting, as Michael Moore pointed out in the documentary, that of all 535 members of both houses of Congress, only one (at the time it was filmed) had a son or daughter serving in the U.S. military in Iraq.  With Mr. Bush thwarting efforts to investigate the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the close ties between the Bush & bin Laden families and the involvement of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney with the oil industry and military-industrial complex respectively, the reasons for invading Iraq become quite blurred; but the killing continues unabated while Osama bin Laden remains at large.\n\nOverall, I rate Michael Moore's 2004 documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  What has kept the U.S. a free country for more than 200 years is the right of its citizens to question the actions of the government, which is exactly what Michael Moore did in this very insightful documentary.  Just watch out for John Ashcroft singing.";"""The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous."""
25;1332.0;5.0;6.0;I had heard a lot about this film but until recently had never seen it. My only question is, why aren't Bush and Cheney in jail. I researched the occupation of Iraq quite a bit before seeing this film. I wanted to be able to make an informed opinion. Frankly, I think their needs to be a part 2. With all that's come out since this was originally done their should be a follow-up. I think people need to open their eyes and stop defending this man. It's unbelievable that Bush may get away with this. He's shown us just how far the rich will go to get richer.;The truth hurts sometimes
12;1333.0;5.0;5.0;"I'm both impressed and agitated, but indecisive though. What is really the truth? Moore's mockumentary is thought-provoking and gives the impression that it depicts the stifled and hidden truth. But we've learned to be critical of any  documentary that uses propaganda-like means - and Michael undoubtedly does employ rhetorical devices that has (used in any other topic, notably with evil intentions) the potential to short-circuit balanced reasoning and which is predominantly emotional. Not that Michael has any vicious in mind, not at all, quite the contrary.\n\nOn the other hand, Michael Moore has never denied that he is not polemic and doesn't harness emotional propaganda-like material. And he has never denied that his documentation style is in part unbalanced and unfair. It seems he has come to the insight that this is the only way to raise awareness and to give some parts of American society a wake-up call. For the European audience, predominantly accustomed to think critically of the United State's warfare under G. W. Bush, of any warfare and patriotic militarism whatsoever, it seems a little too much. From the perspective of an American journalist and filmmaker it might be the legitimate way to depict grievances and clear things up, that would otherwise be falsified and sifted out by the mass media, courtesy of the U.S. administration and its alleged lobbyists.\n\nIntermittently some scenes struck me as slightly questionable. We don't know what George W. Bush was really thinking when he learned terrorists have attacked the Unites States - and we don't know how other politicians would have looked in this situation - not even Barack Obama. In this case, Michael is toying with speculations, not with facts. Nevertheless, as mentioned, may it be legitimate facing the atrocities following the attacks.\n\nVery riveting and revealing was the quote of George Orwell book ""Nineteen-Eighty-Four"", expounding the function of warfare for a modern society. And it was daring as well.\n\nIn conclusion and maybe a little surprising, but assuredly not as a u-turn I daresay: Time has told and proved that this movie was an overdue antidote against the treacherous, fraudulent warfare propaganda spread by the American government in those years. Fahrenehit 9/11 is without question a gem, absolutely worth seeing and something that will reverberate in your mind for a long time.";Back then an overdue antidote

I mean people lived in fear, and all the facts in this movie show makes you wonder, how the bule motherfudge did Bush get re-elected?

I thought it was pretty funny.  It's sad that I'm thinking of the goverment of the county that I'm in like that.(Or is it our president?

30;1336.0;1.0;6.0;"...and to paraphrase this comedian's live act ""'Fahrenheit 9/11' now there's a movie that has people up in arms. Michael Moore could be narrating ""On September 10th, George Bush took a sip of water"" (audience reaction) oh f**k""\n\nThat is the feeling I got throughout this film as Moore narrated.  While I enjoy his films and the persona he shows in them, he may never make a film as bad as this one. He seems to be conspicuously absent on the screen for much of the time and that makes his narration feel intrusive, as if he's trying to distance himself from the material in any small way he can so he doesn't seem too mean spirited and instead give off an aura of truthfulness.  While some of the things he says in this film are eye opening to the casual observer a number of the conclusions that Moore comes to are rash and speculative (which I don't mind, since he does this all the time) which makes most of his films entertaining, if not insightful, but this film is missing a true humor about itself because it was intended for a specific political purpose (with effects expected) in mind. To me, art never works that way since people often see the art much later than the intended effects, such is the case with me. Apart from the controversy, this film just doesn't entertain, or inform us. Moore wants to call Bush a criminal, but never does (for libel reasons, no doubt) so he just implies it. That's the problem with this documentary, it seems to pull the most obvious of punches when that's the reason for its existence, to knock out the opposition.  When you repress the execution of the major point for any reason, the result is going to come out badly, but that doesn't mean it isn't funny, it just isn't very good, or lasting.";I believe Todd Barry summed it up best....

240;1338.0;4.0;7.0;"I have felt really alone in my opinions for a long, long time.  Especially after Bush was re-elected. I felt like the only one in the entire country that sees the truth about him.  This video gave me a lot of hope, that maybe people will see it and change their minds.  This video is extremely one-sided, I will admit.  If you hate Bush, you'll love it.  If you voted for Bush, you may feel stupid, but you will probably just be mad.  Michael Moore's opinions are very, very strong and if you do not agree with them, his documentaries tend to fall flat.  Also, I do not believe that all of his ""facts"" in the video are necessarily true.  Some of them are a little far-fetched, and even while I do not support the Bush administration, some of what was said in the video just doesn't seem reasonable.  But other than that, the footage of the war was real and I was saddened to see what's going on over there (for both sides.  The footage of the Iraqi children, the dead baby, and the other dead civilians was enough to make me look away from the tv for a few seconds).  And knowing that this war has no real purpose makes me sadder than anything else.  Anytime people die in a war with no cause leaves me with a churning anger in my stomach.  I was not alive during the Vietnam war, but I can still feel the anger that has lingered in the country over such an unnecessary bloodshed.\n\nI don't really like Michael Moore, but this documentary was exactly what I needed.  I watched it after learning that one of my good friends is going to war sometime this year.  It was suggested to me I watch this.  I have been against the Iraq war for awhile now.  It wasn't always that way.  I was at one time a huge Bush supporter/war supporter and one of those crazy Republicans you dread getting into an argument with.  Of course I feel like a moron for that now, and I have since become a Democrat.  But at the time (just after 9/11), I felt terrified and unsafe in this country and, like everyone else in America, I turned to the guy who said he had all the answers, the guy who said he would protect us from another terrorist attack and secure our future by avenging the 9/11 deaths (something that I DO feel was necessary, by the way.  I am not against all war, but striking Iraq after Afghanistan was pointless and had *nothing* to do with it).  Now I feel cheated and lied to, and also very powerless.  I feel like those of us in America that are against the war no longer have a say.  We are pushed to the side and called anti-american.  Michael Moore finally gave us the voice that was taken from us when Bush was re-elected.  I do not know what the next four years will bring, but I know that if things continue as they are, America will never recover.  And that is sadder than anything.";Finally. . .

264;1341.0;3.0;7.0;"Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, generated considerable controversy with good reason. It is difficult to imagine anyone viewing the film, especially during 2004, an election year, without developing rather strong feelings about the subject matter. From the title of the film alone, the viewer prepares for a gut-wrenching experience in preparation for watching a documentary that intends to shoot from the hip and does so relentlessly and without apology. Producer/director Michael Moore's appearance in his own film makes it clear that he acts purely from personal motivation in creating such a film at such a strategic time. The question that many are trying to ask is: is Michael Moore pro-American, anti-American, anti-Bush, or what? How can any person conceive of such a disturbing film to show to a public that is still living in the trauma of the event s of September 11, 2001 unless he is trying to convey a message? Even more of a question is: just what are we supposed to understand from this film? Is this Michael Moore's day in the sun, or is it an indictment of President George W. Bush?\n\nMoore's dislike of President Bush and the Bush family is obvious from the start. The film paints a very negative picture of the Bush family as being driven only by oil-based wealth that is linked directly to the Bin Laden family, the Saudi royal family, and various personalities that are all apparently ""in on the deal"" in terms of generating profits from all the events that developed before and after September 11, 2001. Moore makes it a point of presenting the idea that the tragedy of September 11, 2001 was a carefully orchestrated event performed with the knowledge and, more than likely, consent of the Bush family at a time when Bush was, as the film states, ""on vacation"" as his popularity rating plunged. The film is truly a cynic's delight in making the point that everything that took place on September 11, 2001 had but one purpose: to generate more wealth for the Bush family and the Saudis, both of whom enjoy an immense amount of protection by the Secret Service.\n\nMoore's appearance in the film adds an element that makes him open for caustic criticism, as he is neither photogenic nor particularly tactful. The one element that compensates for what many may believe to be Moore's exaggerated ego in making himself a feature in his own film is the obvious sincerity in which he pursues his subject; nobody viewing the film can doubt that he believes very strongly in what he says. His visit back to his hometown of Flint, Michigan hits hard, as he shows the economic devastation in the city and the aggressive efforts to recruit the many young people affected by the economic blight into the military. The footage showing the bereaved family of Sergeant Michael Pedersen hits home in a way that cannot be ignored, unfortunately, by anyone viewing the film.\n\nThe filmed carnage of the war in Iraq, a major feature of the film, evokes memories of the Vietnam War for persons old enough to remember that era; persons from later generations for whom the Vietnam War is only a name from history cannot ignore the grim reality that the war in Iraq is something that has already impacted American society permanently. The film, however, makes a compelling point that the one and only motive for launching the war in Iraq was commercial and suited the needs of the Bush oil empire more than protected the American people, which was the reason President Bush appears in the film as stating as the objective of the war. Add to that the sight of Lila Lipscombe, the mother of Sergeant Michael Pedersen , who, by her own admission, is a ""conservative Democrat"" and who states openly that she is proud to be American, weeping over her son's death, and the result is a frontal attack that provoked talk in the Bush administration of possibly banning the film. Had the Bush administration taken such an unprecedented measure, Michael Moore would have become a martyr nationwide immediately, and the impact of such an action on Bush's chances for re-election would have been felt acutely.\n\nThe actual attack on September 11, 2001, interestingly enough, takes up so little time in the film that it might seem to some viewers almost insignificant, but it is, in fact, the focus of the entire film. Moore depicts the attack as an event of which the Bush administration had ample prior knowledge and could have prevented simply by monitoring the many Al Qaeda members, most of whom were Saudi nationals, residing in the United States and studying in American flight schools at the time the attack took place. President Bush is depicted as a President-on-vacation throughout the entire period of crisis, and the message that comes across is that the September 11, 2001 attack was only one part of a scheme to manipulate the public into a mindset of terror so that a grandiose scam could be carried out that would generate profits for American firms connected with defense contracting and fossil-fuel energy sources, as well as the Saudi royal family, who, according to the film, is so close to the Bush family as to be regarded as related.\n\nThe film makes no pretense at being balanced in its views. No attempt is made to convince the viewer that the report is nonpartisan or unbiased. The audience sees exactly what Michael Moore wants it to see, and Moore does a superb job of presenting his views in a clear, concise manner on film. The viewer is, therefore, compelled to decide whether to accept the film as an accurate documentary or political propaganda aimed at dislodging George W. Bush from the Presidency. Bush's rather hostile policies toward the underprivileged sectors of the population will probably mean that the film will generate almost unanimous support of Moore's views, especially when they see the exploitation of the victims of the economy. In light of the way Moore pointed out accurately that many of the people living in the economic plight in the United States live in conditions not altogether different from those that exist in war-torn areas of Iraq at that time, persons who wondered if they had anything to hope for in terms of simple survival would surely have expressed their views in November 2004. History relates, however, that Bush was re-elected as President, so if Michael Moore's goal was to prevent re-election, clearly he did not achieve his goal.\n\nIs the film worth seeing? From a historical standpoint, it is. It is, however, definitely not for the faint of heart, and a person who seeks to keep stress levels down might find the film unduly upsetting. However, even if a viewer agrees or disagrees with Moore's documentary, the film has recorded beliefs held by the public that will not go away.";Impossible to Ignore, Unfortunately

Most of the claims Moore makes are now commonly accepted especially the primary one, that we were misled into a war in Iraq and that the Bush regime is a crony of liars and scoundrels.  It's important to consider this film in its political and historical context though.  This came out shortly before the 2004 election and Moore was crucified by right wing media pundits for it (although he was widely cheered by others).  The only real exception to Moore being correct is an aside that has not been validated or revisited; his mentioning some oil pipeline across Afghanistan which hasn't been talked about in a long time, probably for a good reason.";fairly dated but good
296;1344.0;3.0;7.0;"Either you love him or you hate him, but there's one thing you can't forget while viewing this movie and that is this is not a fair movie, meaning there is no side defending the Bush administration and their actions and Micheal Moore has admitted this, not in these exact words, but this is a man who chased Charleton Heston out from a room in his own home so you can't be upset while watching Fahrenheit 9/11's Moore antics. This is a fearless man.\nThe reason this review misses two stars is there was something strange with the delivery of this movie. It deffinately clouds  the mind with emotion. For instance the begining of this movie begins with the haunting audio of the chaos and confusion on the streets of NY just moments after the attack so immediately my heart sank straight to my stomach. Then we see President Bush's reaction when the news was delivered to him during a visit to an elementry school in the middle of a book, which he sits, visibly confused, and decides to continue the story he began with the children and yes, perhaps he could have, or should have, explained to the children that the president is a busy man and apologize for his must needed departure. Then again this is a man who can barely speak infront of adults, would he have sent these children into a panic had he actually opened his mouth? Perhaps he made the best possible decision that he, himself, could handle. Michael Moore made too big a deal out of this in my opinion, and I am NOT defending the President, and I would be the last to.\nVisually, this movie will break your heart, frustrate and anger you. From the Iraqi man holding the deceased baby, the greif and sorrow of the woman whose son was killed in battle, the story of the Iraqi American being detained in the prisons. Yes, these are unjust,horrible and shameful crimes. I was and am appauled. I walked around for days frustrated all over again as I was after 9/11, after the start of the war and after his re-election (which I was no part of). Then I watched a few other documentaries reguarding the Bush administration, one that stands out is Mark Crispin Miller's A Patriot Act and something dawned on me. From a Patriot act I walked away pretty informed, from Fahrenheit 9/11 I walked away really mad and upset. Did Michael Moore just pull on me what he claims to despise and blame the media for, and that is cramming my eyes with the blood soaked footage of the war and 9/11 to make an opinion for me as the news delivers unfavorable images of minorities and people of poverty to make panic and opinions for those who are ignorant to circumstance? For profit? I'm not saying he's wrong in what he's ""saying"", he is very right. However,I dislike a hypocrite, and apparantly no one knows an American like Michael Moore. So let's be careful.\nI do give him great credit for his fairness to the military. At first you'll be horrified to see some Marines blood thirsty, ready and excited to fight and kill and at the music they listen to while in battle. Then there are those Marines who are deffinately doing their duty, but either frightened, repulsed, confused and one in particular taking a stand in reguards to this war. He balanced this completely fair.\n Over all I will say this is deffinately one worth watching. But if you're like me, a house wife with raising kids as your main thought pattern, then you may want to watch this movie twice because this is the type of movie where the visuals cloud your mind with emotion and strongly overshadow the actual information.";No Middle for Mr. Moore

332;1350.0;4.0;7.0;Before watching this movie I had never seen a Michael Moore film.  Although I had heard much talk about Moore's films being works of fiction or at the very least subjective, I couldn't believe that such films would be labeled documentaries if such were true.  Well I was wrong.  In an extremely egotistical rant Michael Moore presents his version of what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan while taking quotes and interviews out of context.  This film is not objective and as a fan of film I am disgusted at the cloaking of the reality of this movie.  Instead of observing the reality of the situation and presenting the facts to the public, Moore begins with a thesis and strives to prove it.\n\nAll that being said this movie is very well made.  As a piece of propaganda it is extremely effective.  Anyone who is not thoroughly educated on the subject matter will fall into Moore's trap and automatically see the Bush Administration as treasonous actors in politics.\n\nMoore is a very shrewd individual and I give him credit for producing a fine work of propaganda, but not a documentary.;Most definately NOT a documentary, but well made propaganda

Spoiler alert:  Moore sums it up best saying ""our soldier's give us the greatest gift, their sacrifice in the line of duty, and all that they ask in return is that we don't send them to war carelessly.""\n\n  In light of the horrible death toll of up to 50,000 people this week from the tsunamis in Asia, I wonder if G.

Why does Moore have a section about the Oregon State Police when it is funded by Oregon State and not the federal government? The most appalling thing about this obvious piece of propaganda is that Moore claims he is behind and supports the soldiers in Iraq %100. Why is there not one positive image of a soldier throughout the entire film? He depicts them as uneducated, brutal savages for his own gain.";Not a documentary, too much bias obviously
36;1354.0;4.0;6.0;"I don't know why I didn't go see this film when it first came out.  Probably a combo of being tired of politics and thinking it could not tell me much more then I already knew at the time.\n\nFor the most part it's a good film.  Moore does a great job in that it's a great vehicle for questions, discussion and debate.\n\nI am only knocking it a point for some of the ""antics"" Moore did for the film.  I didn't care of the bit with the ice cream truck where he drove around reading the patriot act since congress didn't read it.  The ever\npresent ""ambush"" of congressmen is a rather tired bit and overused.  I think it took away from a well crafted film.  I liked the cabinet people going through makeup, the bit where Ashcroft was singing and the\nBushisms.  One thing that was really well done was the seven minutes where Bush sat there doing nothing or reading to the children.  I remember it when it happened and it showed the difference between a leader and this man.  A leader acts.\n\nOther parts of the film where sad and gave me an impression of exploitation.  Such as the woman talking of the loss of her son and later appears at a protest upset and can only mention loosing her son.  Even though there are hints of exploitation, Moore didn't go full into exploiting the collapse of the twin towers.  There is only a couple after shots and a blacked out image with sound tracks.  Very effective I found as even though I had seen it; I still listened.\n\nOne thing I found interesting was his section involving homeland security and the Oregon coast.  One man for a large territory.  There was even an extra about old volunteers trying to patrol South Florida.  Very pertinent info when thinking of the current reports of the lack of security on our borders.\n\nProbably one of the most provocative things was his explanations of molding the people by instilling fear.  The use of the terror alerts and reports of eminent attacks.  I think it did mold people for the war.\n\nThe addons are interesting.  I found the axis of evil comedy troop interesting and yet alarming how people are treated.  There were interviews of Bush and Rice which do offer support to the claims of cover up.  The PDBs and the ""Hairsplitting"" of definitions.  Politics I guess.\n\nOverall; I can put of with the bit's that were pandering and I would recommend the film as it's a good provocative piece that will cause discussion and debate.";Finally saw it and it was ok

Thats basically the sum of the reviews for this film (those of you who've posted a review but have stated clearly you refuse to ever watch the film, are waisting the time of people who actually want an honest opinion.  Go tread somewhere else).\n\nMichael Moore's film comes at a time in our country where political commentary and reporting have reached an all-time low.  In this day and age, we as Americans are forced biased politcal view from every media outlet available, including films.  This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are listening to.  Michael Moore does not hide his political agenda at all, and does not mix intentions.  It's for this reason, he and his film have been labaled ""anti-American"".  However, in my mind, this is as American as it gets.  Right or wrong, Left or Right, Red or Blue, whichever way you swing in politics, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Even if you come away from it with nothing but hatred for Moore, isn't it worth that much to solidify your beliefs?  As an American, I want to know everything I can, and the things that Michael Moore explores in this film, are only one piece of the overall pie when it comes to American Politics.\n\nI loved this film's intentions, as I do most of Moore's other films.  That does not mean I (or any American) hate this country, or the people in charge of it.  To me, what it means, and what Moore represents, is the voice from the other side.  A different point of view.  The silent majority if you will.  I don't always agree with the things Moore says or does, but I truly respect the fact that he is out there, doing what he does, because no one else is, and we NEED someone out there ruffling feathers.\n\nIn terms of the film itself, and the quality of it, I still enjoyed it.  It was funny, scary, depressing, and ultimately, very informative.  I thought it tried a little too much at times, given the broad scope of charges Moore heads up, and would have probably enjoyed another 45 minutes or so to back-up some of the things mentioned.  That's not to say I believe Moore is not being 100% honest with us, it simply meens I wished for a more complete documentary given the topics at hand (I've the feeling that certain parts of the film's research and production value took a back seat to the turn-around time Moore had to get the movie in the theaters and finally into your homes pre-04 election, which he ultimately did)\n\nBottom Line, every American owes it to themselves to at least watch the film, and make your own opininon.  I feel sorry for the people that bash it without having even watched it!  Those are the truly pathetic people of this country, so blinded by agenda, and personal beliefs that they refuse to even entertain the possiblity of anothers point of view.  Thats as anti-America as you can get.  If you've seen any of Michael Moore's previous films, you know what to expect.  If you believe everything the Bush organization tells you, then you have no idea what to expect.";As American as it gets!!!

This documentary was fun to watch just from the standpoint of how distorted and slanted the facts and the editing was. I, however, like more truth than fiction in the documentaries I watch. I give it a low rating because of the way it was marketed and presented (as a documentary presenting the truth). If it had been marketed and presented as a work of fiction, I would've given it a much better rating, just because they did a good job making some of the footage look good on the big screen when in fact they had recorded it off the internet. They also did a great job editing to suck the audience into believing what was presented was true. It reminds me of when Orson Welles did his radio program ""War of the Worlds"" and people actually thought that we were being invaded.....

885;1365.0;2.0;7.0;"Yes, it is possible to dislike both George W. Bush *and* Michael Moore.  I did not vote for Bush in 2000 and will emphatically not be voting for him in 2004.  This does not, however, make me like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" any better.\n\nMoore's movie is a repellent pseudo-documentary and a tragic lost opportunity.  What could have been an intelligent and witty film emerges instead as a sleazy hatchet job embodying all the journalistic ethics of a supermarket tabloid.  From the notorious fake ""news clipping"" (really a letter to the editor -- with a false date) to the deceptive editing to the continuous barrage of grossly misleading innuendos, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a masterpiece of distortion and con artistry worthy of Bush himself.\n\nDave Kopel has put together a widely-read list of ""59 Deceits"" in Moore's ""documentary.""  Be sure to read the full version -- with extensive references -- at davekopel.com, not the brief PDF summary.  It's true that Kopel includes some minor and debatable points, but most of the complaints are fair -- and devastating.\n\nMoore's ""Factual Back-Up"" on his Web site (michaelmoore.com) is fascinating, in a perverse way.  He simply ignores many of the serious flaws noted by Kopel and others, while offering proof of other facts that no one has disputed.  Most amusing is his brazen audacity in citing references that actually *undermine* his position.  To defend his statement that ""Gore got the most votes in 2000,"" Moore quotes from articles entitled ""Recount Provides No Firm Answers"" and ""Review of Ballots Finds Bush's Win Would Have Endured Manual Recount.""  No kidding!  Check it out for yourself.\n\nOf course Moore falls back on selective quotation when necessary.  For example, no one disputes that Fox was the first network to call Florida for Bush, but Moore conveniently omits the fact that CNN and CBS were the first to retract it for Gore.  Moore's ""Factual Back-Up"" is a jewel of misdirection; he simply omits the following key segment from page 15 of the CNN report he cites:\n\n""9:54 p.m.: The Decision Team recommends that CNN and CBS retract their Florida calls for Gore.  The two do so and are the first networks to retract ....""\n\nIt is depressing to think that more people saw this trashy schlock on its opening weekend than will *ever* see Jhally and Earp's superb anti-Bush documentary ""Hijacking Catastrophe.""";Good intentions, sleazy filmmaking
910;1366.0;1.0;7.0;9/11 is not even mediocre fiction. Moore is nothing but a bitter fat kid looking to strike back for being consistently chosen last in gym class. As an individual, wholly lacking in talent,integrity,and substance, he has succeeded, at one level,in demonstrating that America is truly the land of opportunity. Where else would a charlatan, creating his own version of reality, meet with such astonishing success?  Simply put, he is a creative, unscrupulous,liar, with a curiously gullible following.;Michael Less
1058;1367.0;4.0;7.0;"I finally got to see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", and I don't know where to begin describing it.  The first adjective that comes to my mind is ""horrifying"".  How honest is Michael Moore with this film?  One thing is for certain: he is honest about his intent, which is to help defeat Bush in 2004.  The quotes he uses from the Bush administration folks are genuine, as they are provided in the form of video clips that feature the suspects.\n\nAs usual, Moore injects a lot of his personal emotions...  he is a master at this.  There is speculation which appears a bit wild at times, particularly in the first half of the film.  However, the basic information is there and the questions arise from it.\n\nMoore asks tough questions about why Saudi nationals were allowed to leave the U.S. during the days immediately following 9-11, why people aren't more concerned about the close ties between the Bush family and the Saudis, why we let Bin Lauden get such a big head start on us before we went into Afghanistan, why we really went to Iraq, etc. ad nauseum.  For the most part, he steers clear of using fallacies as he presents his questions and arguments;  he mainly uses real information as a springboard.\n\nI would imagine most avid left-wingers will at least try to see the movie.  Most right-wingers will probably not bother, preferring to wish the film would go away.  After all, it represents an attempt to upset the status quo, and it is a radically different way of looking at things than what they are taught to think by conservative TV and radio programming.  My hope is that many ""undecided"" voters will see it and find themselves as horrified as I was at how Orwellian the Bush neoconservatives are made out to be;  if the Bushies keep hammering away at us, we may well soon believe that ""War is peace"".\n\nInquiring minds want to know, and Moore provides plenty of fodder for thought.  This film may help us realize how repugnant politicians are in general...  and particularly the delusional little cabal currently running (ruining) the United States of America.\n\nThere are some out there who hate free speech and would like to suppress it in order that only one narrow set of views is available to Americans.  Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity immediately come to mind.  People of that ilk must be squirming in their seats every time they hear about Michael Moore or about the success of this movie.  As they plot various ways to suppress the voices of dissent, we should be thankful they are being made uncomfortable.  These people seem to want a one-party system in America.  I believe they are out of touch with what a majority of Americans feel about this country.\n\nMichael Moore has referred to this film as a ""comedy"".  I certainly wouldn't call it that, as I found the laughs to be few and far between, especially in the second half of the movie.  I would place this in the ""horror"" category.  The Iraq footage is terrifying, and it is not for the faint of heart.  The interviews with the troops left me feeling empty.  Some of them expressed a sort of joy in killing Iraqis, including citizens.  I think it's likely that only a handful of our troops actually feel the same as those depicted in the film, but when I see their attitudes and behaviors displayed on the movie screen and pair it with the images of Iraqi prisoner treatment, I believe these troops aren't to blame for their actions.  Problem behaviors such as these begin at the top, through macho/arrogant leadership and that leaderships' misguided attitude toward the rest of the world...  it seems like it's ""God Bless America and God Damn All The Others.""\n\nThere is nothing comedic about that.  We simply can't command the respect of the rest of the world, we need to earn it.  At this point, thanks to our current administration, we need to earn that respect back.  They all loved us after the September 11 attacks, now many of them hate us.  How did that happen so fast?  Moore points out these things and explores them...  and to his credit, he isn't shown much throughout the movie.  He is mostly there as a voice-over.  Considering how self-aggrandizing he tends to be, I found this to make the film that much more watchable.\n\nIf you disagree with what Moore says in ""Fahrenheit 9-11"", I hope you have at least bothered to see the film.  If you refuse to go see it, then maybe it is because you are afraid of being exposed to things that run counter to your belief systems.  Moore's film should horrify true left-wing believers and hardcore conservatives alike...  hopefully enough that a wholesale change will come about at election time.\n\nFirst half of the film:  2.5 stars.  Second half:  5 stars.  Overall rating:  4";"Classify under ""Horror"""

This production was created with much thought and careful consideration.\n\nAnd I can't reduce it to simply 'mud-slinging' in an election year.

1300;1377.0;4.0;7.0;I would really rate this 3 stars, but gave it an additional star because it shows some of what NO ONE ELSE has had the guts to show us.\n\nPros:\n1.  Engaging from start to finish\n2.  Good balance of narrative, emotional stories and starchy facts.\n3.  Good variety of sources and interviews\n4.  Goes where no one has gone before to connect the dots between this administration and big business.\n5.  Moore is narrating most of the time and not in front of the camera as in some of his previous movies.\n\nCons:\n1.  Nothing about Blair and the British Intelligence - both provided significant input in the case for war.\n2.  Shows some no-name countries that are members of the coalition.  Neglects to mention that Britain and Spain were two major supporters of the initial coalition.\n3.  A bit cartoonish at times (for a documentary), but perhaps needed to be so in order to not bore the American public.\n\nOverall:  Highly recommended.  You should see this!;Poured on too thick at times, but quite good

Like most, I laughed and I cried, and left the theater exhausted emotionally, and in a state of alarm\nA Bush victory in the next election would lend confirmation to their belief that they can do anything to the country, and get away with it because, despite the events since 9/11 as  documented in Moore's film, books and other sources (mainly foreign) they will know with certainty that:\n1. The media can be ""bought"", and spew only what they want.\n2. The American public has become passive. It is nicely over-recreationalized, ill-informed, comfortable with the belief that what they hear in the (see above) media is the truth, and reluctant to (or ignorant of how to, or too lazy to) protest or resist what they do. It has surrendered its sovereignty. It's gone limp, even the cynical contingent, and they can lie with impunity. It will be almost expected!\n3. It is also afraid of appearing un-American, disrespectful of the Presidency and un-patriotic. After all, as we Americans have been told since birth, the United States stands perennially for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". They can push, pull and twist these twin concepts out of all meaning, and use as necessary. Works like a charm!\n4. Countless have died to serve their greedy policies, and it's ok. They bought that they were fighting for ""freedom"" and ""democracy"". As to the Iraqi dead, out of sight, out of mind.\n5. All in all, a dictatorship is not all that hard to install, if backed by enough money.\nA line in an old movie (The Day of the Condor) resonates now in my mind.

It is the role of Michael Moore to fearlessly pursue truth in the face of the current Right Wing bureaucracy that is gratefully inspiring us to resist the media and the madness of the warmongering administration and demand change.  FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is a well conceived, well constructed, and yes - funny, if you can get far enough away form the absurdity of the speeches, comments, conversations, and 'songs' of the leaders of this now universally unpopular nation to be able to appreciate just how ridiculous these players are. It is also utterly terrifying in its reality view. This is not an art film, not a documentary by itself, but this little movie is a huge statement about just how far off track we've gone. Hopefully, Michael Moore's genius will be a much need wakeup call to us as voters empowered with our freedom of speech to make some MAJOR changes!;The Satirist's Edge: A Wakeup Call of Monumental Importance
1414;1381.0;4.0;7.0;"Michael Moore had a chance to do a phenomenal film on American society and foreign policy but he allowed himself to be drawn into a partisan pre electoral film: this will substantially reduce the historical value of the film.\nThe first third of the film on George W Bush is shooting below the belt (and I'm French so I supposedly should have liked that). His placing thoughts into the president's mind at the time the planes hit the towers is a nasty slanted cinema gimmick. For the President to feel distressed in such a circumstance and keeping a face as he measures the importance and the consequences of such an important drama shows dignity. The trick of placing a voice over with ridicule comments does not.\nSo you'll have to wait until the film gets out of the finding ridicule in George W. Bush (which fortunately comes soon enough) to get into a great film.\nThen Michael Moore takes us with his great talent into real and deep political problems (including the Bush family economical involvement with the Bin Laden family), and the film gets into its claimed humanist tone keeping drama out of the grave tone. These later two third of the movie are just superb.\nThe reaction of the senators being requested to have their children enlisted will go down in history.\nSo don't get this comment wrong: despite its partisan aspect, it is a great film, an absolute ""must see"" whether you are a Republican or Democrat.";Philosophy or politics
1420;1382.0;4.0;7.0;For years I've regarded Bush as a menace to the country.  When the first huge tax cut passed I felt that the nation had been raped.. I was cautiously hopeful that things would be O.K. when Bush first shoe-horned his way into office, but since then they've earned my loathing.  Moore makes the case plain as day.\nBut my sense is that this movie is tragically flawed.  It may be helpful to the 2% of the electorate still on the fence, but it won't reach the more important segment of the population, those Clinton-Republicans that Kerry has to reach in order to get elected.\nBasically, the bias is just too obvious.  It felt as if Moore were throwing red meat to the choir - people like myself - when he really should have bent over backwards to make the case to the millions of people who had not been paying attention to politics.  Those multitudes with misplaced respect for BushCo.. We need their votes - we can't do this by ourselves.\nFor example:\nAlthough the Iraqi oil-grab war was full of deception and wrong, everyone knows that Saddam was running a monsterous dictatorship.  Moore should not have pretended that Baghdad was Shangri-La before the invasion.\nMoore should have mentioned that the Coalition was not only Palau and Nicuagua, it also included Britain & Australia & Poland - for the 15% of the troops they contributed.  The more accurate his story, the more believable.\nMoore left out some noteworthy details about the arms-manufacturer owned by the Carlyle Group.  They also designed the Crusader artillery system, which Rumsfeld canceled in 2002.. So the conspiracy may be there, but it isn't as tight as Moore makes it appear.\nMoore showing Bushco getting makeup done before press conferences, or putting the Gang of Four's heads on cowboy's bodies.. It was funny for people who already felt that these guys were sinister.  It was over-the-top and off-putting for anyone who hadn't yet made up their mind.\nHe would have done better by putting out Bush's full, real premise, which I believe was something like 'America Needs Oil - we can't let the EU take control of the region!' - and then showing the deceptions inherent in their policies from that point of view.\nFor example, the oil would have been on the market anyway, so the only real beneficiaries were the facilities companies, Halliburton, Exxon etc., who beat out their Russian & EU competitors.\nThen there's the war profiteering, poor planning, prisoner-abuse, Ahmed Chalabi, media deceptions, financial cost, etc.\nHe could have streamlined this movie and been more careful to include more objective data.  As it is O'Reilly can take pot-shots at this film and as a result the millions of right-leaning voters won't go to the theatre. They may side with Limbaugh's Lemmings instead..\nThe GOP is now throwing as much mud in the air as it can.. Hopefully this will still effect the race, but I still think Moore over-shot the goal.  This was a lost opportunity.;Great but flawed, It won't swing the election.
1426;1383.0;5.0;7.0;"All documentaries have a point of view, and all news media have a point of view -- stop with the semantics of ""Fair and Balanced"" or ""Truth"".  FARENHEIT 9/11 is one long OP ED piece to justify why Michael Moore thinks the way he does about Iraq and Bush.  Even in interviews he says ""This is based on my opinions!""  All facts presented support his argument, and they are all true.  But he is presenting only the items supporting his view!  It's something talk radio hosts and political candidates have mastered over the years, and is nothing new.  Rush Limbaugh would find a close and fast friend in Moore if they could put aside their ideology.\nThe movie is entertaining and disturbing all at once.  Never boring, always engaging!  It's a great 2 hours no matter what politics are behind it.  Masterfully edited, beautifully scored, and well stated throughout.  Gone are the usual Moore stunt interviews, and present are some truly heart-breaking moments ... most notably with a mother who loses a son in the war.  I don't care what side of the politics you are on - the segments with Linda Lipscomb going to Washington DC after her son has been killed captures how a patriot feels after losing her child.  Truly moving!\nGo see this movie no matter where you fall, because for the first time we have a film that inspires debate in this country.

I wasn't until his Oscar Winning film ""Bowling for Columbine"" I fully cherished his work (and his books too.)  I just came from seeing ""Farhrenheit 9/11"" and I have to say THIS WAS INCREDIBLE.  In a packed theater, people were laughing, applauing at certain times ( at least seven times thoughout the film), and really paying attention to what was going on in the film.  At the end, there was an enormous appluse.  This is a very important film for EVERYONE to see.  This is one film that will definitely be in my DVD collection when it comes out.  Congratulations to Michael Moore for winning the Palm D'Or at Cannes for his film.  This film will make you laugh, remember, think, and enjoy.";Best Film of the Year
1450;1385.0;5.0;7.0;Michael Moore, known for his on the street in your face documentary filmmaking for the most part just lets the images speak for themselves, and boy do they.  Fahrenheit 9/11 shows many things about the current and recent state of the government, while his favorite target is Bush himself.  Whether Michael is showing how the Saudi royal family has had important business connections with the Bush's, or whether Michael is trying to recruit senator's sons to join the army, Michael shows how not just Bush, but our government has ignored the crucial problems for personal convenience.  This movie is emotionally powerful and intellectually stirring.  I urge everyone to go see this film, for once you do, there is no looking back at the world in the same way.;just sit back, and watch it play
1483;1386.0;5.0;7.0;"I cannot think of another movie in modern times where your enjoyment depended so strongly on your political views. There was a movie made a while ago which starred Joan Allen called ""The Contender"" that Republicans bashed as being too liberal, but they didn't seem to take that film on as personally as they are this film, ""Fahrenheit 9\11"". And it really is this simple. If you are a Democrat there's a 90% chance you'll enjoy this film. If you are a Republican there's a 90% chance you'll hate this movie. I say 90% because nothing in life is 100% except as the old joke goes death and taxes.\n Most people should know by now what this film is about. We have all heard the controversy surrounding it for quite some time now. But not until Wednesday were audiences allowed to see the Golden Palm winner at the Cannes Film Festival.\n Michael Moore takes a look at the Bush Administration and accusses the Bush family of having ""ties"", and we've seen how confusing that word can be lately, with the bin Laden family and makes a point of saying there is much going on behind the American people's back concerning the war in Iraq, members of the Bush cabinet, and other issues such as homeland security.\n I admit I have been dying to see this movie. I couldn't wait. I'm a fan of Michael Moore and his politics, I feel it's important, at least when talking about a movie like this to be upfront as to what your political views are. Because some views will prevent many from having an open mind and enjoying this film. I am a liberal Democrat, and I'm 110% against the right-wing.\n I was extremely interested through-out the entire lenght of the film and was completely surprised to learn what I did. Some things the American public already know such as Dick Cheney's involvment with Halliburton, the prison-abuse scandal, and according to Richard Clarke, President Bush's preoccupation with Iraq before and after 9\11.\n Many member of the right-wing have already came out and advised people not to see this film. That say it is nothing but lies. But, if you see the movie, and this is what I like best about it, Moore never actually makes the claims. He uses the New York times, the L.A. times, interviews from Good Morning America, the Today Show, the 9\11 investigation hearings, and Larry King to support his claimes. He shows clips of these interviews where OTHER people make these accusations NOT Moore. I firmly believe 100% what I was shown. And don't kid yourselves, Moore is not the first to say these things.\n But, political ideas aside is ""Fahrenheit 9\11"" worth seeing? Yes. It is well-made, very, very funny and displays Moore's conviction to the subject. Some may say he makes it too personal, but because of that he can see Moore gets his facts straight. He devoted a lot of time to this exactly because it was personal, and he wanted to present the best case he could against Bush.\n Every American should see this film. Consider it the political ""Passion of the Christ"". Take the whole family to see this, we, the American people, need to know what's going on. Anyone who plans to vote this year I pled with you, go see this film. Not that it matters, because I think of this as more than just a movie, but, it's one of the best films I've seen all year. It stirred me up and is a great conversation piece to discuss with people.\n I haven't given much away because that wouldn't be fair. You need to see this and just be prepared to be shocked at what's going on behind our backs. This is a MASTERPIECE and I plan on seeing it again.\n Something else that needs to be pointed out is people will assume MY political beliefs cause me to be bias towards the film. Let me explain something. One of the things I feel makes a movie great is when it gives you something to think about. When it's thought provoking. Whether you like or hate this film, it's NOT one of those movies where after you leave you'll forget about it 5 minutes later. It has a strong lasting power. It makes you think and raises I feel very important questions that deserve answers. Also as I already stated, the movie is a conversation piece, it may cause a debate. This is what makes a movie great. How many films cause such intense feelings after seeing them? How many movies stay with us long after we have seen them? And how many will cause a debate? Not many. And the ones that do we often consider great movies. That is half of the reason why I recommend people see this film and why I call it a masterpiece.\n Bottom-line: As far as I'm concerned, an honest look at the Bush Administration showing us things many of us never would have dreamed possible. Liberals rejoice and vote Kerry in '04! It's time we take back the Presidency and Congress.";The Heat Is On

63;1389.0;2.0;6.0;"This ""documentary"" was so-so, and way too favorable toward the brutal, anti-Semitic, porn-obsessed Saddam Hussein. The movie portrays Iraq as this desert oasis that the United States destroyed--filmmaker and poseur Catholic Mickey Moore didn't bother to interview any of the women that Uday Hussein had raped, or relatives of people who were tortured to death in Saddam's meat shredders. This movie was more of a hatchet job than an objective presentation of facts, except this time, propagandist Moore isn't trying to befuddle a gracious Charles Heston (""Bowling for Columbine""), and then later re-editing his footage to make Heston appear in the worst possible light. He pulls the same trick on anybody outside the Democratic Party tent, who by the way, voted to invade Iraq, although they'll now tell you that President George W. Bush was so beguiling that he fooled everyone. If the Democrats were fooled by Bush, whom they ridiculed as a poor public speaker, they should not be governing. Hoewver, Moore doesn't care about facts, he cares about who's a Democrat or Republican. If you really want to see an expose of how Washington, D.C., is controlled by moneyed biotech interests, see ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" with Denzel Washington.

It is with his same sharp insight that he delivers a stinging critique of the Bush Administration in this awesome documentary. If you missed it the first time around because you were clinging to the belief that our leader must know what he is doing, don't hesitate now.

While he makes great arguments, I just felt like he was forcing my hand a little too hard to have me believe everything.  Some of his theories are convincing, but on a general level, I found his documentary extremely opinionated (then again, it's Michael Moore right?).  It just felt like I was being pressured into believing something, which sometimes seemed a little far-fetched.\n\nWhile I appreciated Michael Moore's ""gesture"" by trying to open everyone's eyes to the reality of the situation and different quite probable theories, it felt a little too like ""force-feeding"" for my taste.

155;1395.0;4.0;6.0;I've seen this film a couple of times and while it's not my favourite of Mr. Moore's work, there is certainly a lot of food for thought there.  I find myself thinking about Farenheit  9/11 whenever the stench of  stealth bubbles up in Washington, which seems to be more and more frequently and more and more serious.  Michael Moore probably has more patriotism in his pinky finger than can be mustered up in the whole of  Washington, yet Mr. Moore takes the criticism for speaking out.\n\nSuggest you check out the writings of Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, USMC, particularly the excerpt from his speech regarding war and the reasons for war which he delivered way back in 1933.  Chilling!;Fahrenheit  9/11
158;1396.0;4.0;6.0;I had to watch this movie twice the first time.  It was so confusing I had to sit down and write out a flow chart of who was who and what each connection was to each other.  That was the only way I could even attempt to grasp this huge conspiracy theory.\n\nThis is Michael Moore's masterpiece, a throughly researched and picked apart documentary of how September 11th could have would have should have and how it's lead to our Iraq occupation.  After having watched this, I didn't feel one way or another about it.  I don't feel conspired against, I don't feel deceived, and I don't feel angry.  It was clear to me after the Gulf War of the early 90s that we thought there was going to be a revolution and Saddam Hussein would be ousted by his own people, but it didn't happen.  We were wrong, it was a lightening war, and now our gas prices are through the roof.  We thought that we were going to find Ousama Bin Lauden quickly, we haven't yet.  And, perhaps most importantly of all, Michael Moore wanted to vote out George W Bush, and he didn't.\n\nHaving looked back on all these things, I am rather amazed yet at the same time I feel an odd understanding of things.  The reason I do not give this movie 5 stars is because it is a personal attack against George W and not truly against his political stance.  On the day that the towers were hit, he was in an elementary school class and they timed his reaction once the news was whispered to him.  If I were him, I would sit there with a blank look on my face too.  Who's in charge here?  I AM.  I'd just be glad I didn't wet my pants.  He likes to portray George as stupid, I don't believe he's stupid.  And when I am looking at the state of the economy I don't blame him for it unlike everyone else.  I blame myself, like a lot of others should do.  You choose so many things for yourselves, world.  You blame George for your state of unemployment, rising costs, and dwindling finances, but those who yell the loudest don't get off their lazy asses and put our shoulders to the wheel.\n\nAnd, I write this long after George won the second election.  That I was shocked at, because the people seemed so angry.  But why did he win again when Michael Moore made such an effort to call for a coupe?  Because people are angry, but they don't care enough to vote.  I was amazed as angry as people are that they simply do not care.\n\nStill, this is a good movie.

183;1400.0;5.0;6.0;Not much new can be said in praise of this superb film. I'm always struck by the beauty of  Jeff Gibbs' score. The successful use of other music, including Jarvo's 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten' and most of the pop elements, is indebted to the deeply felt original score Gibbs has created. Synth effects, maybe, but the pieces are beautifully conceived, if not entirely without precedent. The brutal effect of the film depends so tenderly on the musical score, one is reminded of Britten's high valuation of the usefulness of music. Moore's vision is commendable, and beholden in turn to the musical tableaux of Jeff Gibbs. The soundtrack CD is fine, but needs the film as much as the film cries out for Gibbs' music.  Highest recommendation for both film and musical score, both Moore and his composer. [2007 update: It's unfortunate, isn't it, how the conservative/fascist think tanks that blight the American social-political landscape actually hire people to scour [...], among other sites, in order to vote 'negative' on reviews that repudiate their vicious political agenda?

The 'votes' against this review are one example - negative 'votes' for what is really a non-political review of a film, a review focused almost entirely on the film's musical score! One can find this tactic throughout the amazon site. No matter. This is a great film that exposes Bush for the fraud he is, something the American public finally realized in 2006.

The best review was by a liberal published in Slate magazine [...] The film Michael Moore should have made is ""911 in Plane Site.""

244;1406.0;4.0;6.0;Michael Moore is taking on the most powerfull regime in the world- America's government. Or to be more precise-Bush.

252;1407.0;5.0;6.0;This movie is great.  I haven't seen it and don't plan too but i love everything that michel mooore does and i don't car what anyone else says!  wooo wooo!!;Horray!
23;1408.0;5.0;5.0;This came out before it was cool to hate Bush.  Moore should be thanked for that.  While not his best effort (editing was a little poor, IMHO), there are some must-see moments.  If you've decided you're going to defend our rotten president no matter what, you're sure to hate this movie.  If you think the media has told you what you need to know about America under Bush, you're sure to be surprised.;See this movie
276;1409.0;4.0;6.0;I didn't think that I would like this movie... but I did. With all the news that's come after it was put out, and there being no real reasoning for the Iraq war to have even happened, I think it turns out that Michael Moore was right after all.;This movie really opened my eyes
277;1410.0;5.0;6.0;Last evening - F911. If y'all have never gleaned, I am not terribly informed on a political basis and typically just steer clear of discussions in politics. I have no basis but emotion and intuition on which to place most of my discussion.\n[...]\nI am still absorbing so many of the longstanding connections to all the wrong folks that this family has and how designed the presidency of Dubya is and continues to be.\n\nAnd it just puts an awful lump in my gut when thinking about 9/11 and how much that man and his family have actually benefited and profited from that day's events.\n\nThen, on DVD we watched VERONICA GUERIN, which was also an amazing film.\n\nAnd both left me feeling like - against such big meanness - what can anyone one person do?;Rrrrrrrrrrrr....
279;1411.0;5.0;6.0;"F 911  hits the bullseye dead on, and then hits it again repeatedly for the next 90 minutes. Critics be damned, The Prez and his cronies hang themselves here with their own sound bites, none which are edited out of context, and none which are monkeyed with by Moore. What you have here is another Michael Moore painstakingly researched documentary (like all his others)with no filler, and since the 911 Commission's report has been released, no points to question, or called by some, outright lies. The facts are there for everyone to see, and hear, but some won't accept because of some false political ideology, or worn out political dogma. But they are here, folks. Straight from the commander in chief's mouth, and memos, and press conferences. Step right up folks and see the President sell the public a bad bill of goods. Some say it's not a documentary. WRONG! Documentaries HAVE to have a point of view. If it doesn't it should be called the evening news. F 911 is explosive, and outright depressing in the way the current administration are willing to go to war so the ""powers that be"" can make lots of easy bucks. Moore has balls, no doubt, big brass AMERICAN balls.";another winner from MM
280;1412.0;4.0;6.0;"I am currently a junior in college and majoring in Political Science so I was very interested in seeing this film. When you are aware of the source (Moore) and his views on the country this ""documentary"" can be a helpful educational tool, but you must not take 100% of this to heart.\n\nMoore does not make things up, BUT he does present some of the facts of the movie in a way that makes them more shocking than they are in reality. For example : Moore makes a big deal of the fact that the Bush family has personal/business ties to the bin Laden family, which taken on its face IS shocking, but when you research it you will learn that anyone with a business hand in oil has relations with the bin Laden family, and it is a huge family, who disowned the infamous Osama. So the fact that the Bush's associate with the large bin Laden family shouldn't be quite as shocking as it comes across.\n\nSo while his movie is filled with actual facts some of the things he points out aren't really as uncommon as he would like us to believe (like the segment which he is SHOCKED to learn that members of Congress don't read all of the bills they pass in their entirety... well DUHHHH they are thousands of pages and there are tons of them!)\n\nOn the otherhand some of the things simply are shocking, and there is no way around them, such as the mother of a fallen solider sharing her story of how her sons final government check was docked the days of that week in which he was dead. That's disgustingly disrespectful of our government.\n\nI have to say I enjoyed the film. Moore has a way of infusing entertainment into his fact. He does make several points and theories as to why the wars following 9-11 happened.\n\nI think that if you view this movie with a sceptical eye you will be satisfied with it. Just go into viewing it after you learn a bit about Moore and his agenda. As with everything that has to do with politics there is always an agenda, and if you go into this movie aware of Moore's agenda you will know what to black out and what to take in. Just read up on his facts and listen to all sides of the story. But Moore's point of view is as valuable as anyones and worth all of the recognition.";Review
286;1413.0;5.0;6.0;This important 'film of our times' is not to be missed.  It is a scathing and mostly truthful view of this inept and foolish administration that is leading us down the wrong road in so many ways, domestically and internationally.  True patriotism is not a 'party dependent' concept.  Yet the right wing would have you think it is, as they feel they have the market cornered on patriotism, morality, and truth. Moore, like millions of Americans and people around the world, shows his patriotism, outrage, and concern throughout this masterpiece by exposing Bush for what he is.  Mainly, an arrogant, inept fool who uses 'god' to illegally invade another sovereign country based on WMD lies and the fear of terrorism brought to focus on 9/11.  Even though it was mostly Saudi nationals who attacked us that day, not Iraqis!  Most of the world believes that our retaliation in Afghanistan was a 'just war', whereas this Iraqi invasion was folly and wrong.  The geological areas that were hit on 9/11 (NY, PA, D.C.) even voted against Bush last November.  That says it all.  If you care about America, see this great, truthful patriotic film, or ignore it at your peril!  I have a lot of respect for Michael Moore's work, and his penchant and talent in exposing hard truths, which is in many cases the road less travelled these days in America.  God Bless Michael Moore!;One hundred stars!  An eye-opening film!  Moore is a genius!
290;1414.0;3.0;6.0;"Before starting my review, I should probably say that for the most part, I agree with Michael Moore's politics. I dislike president Bush and his regime, and think they have been very destructive in their first term (here's hoping the second term isn't so bad). That being said, Moore's controversial ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a disappointingly mixed bag. Unlike ""Roger and Me"" or ""Bowling for Columbine,"" it's straight propoganda. Moore hits the audience over the head with his message, giving this reviewer a severe headache by the film's close. While Moore doesn't appear on camera as much as his previous films, his narration is near-constant - his narration combined with the endless news footage and documents gives this an irritating ""slide show"" or ""court case"" feeling. While Moore's previous films had interesting human stories, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" gives us only the plight of Flint war mother Lila Lipscomb. Moore attempts some of his trademark pranking, but it's unsatisfactory (particularly in the awkward Patriot Act scene - a prank that peters out before a punchline). After a while, the film just gets dull. That being said, there is still plenty good to say about it - the scene where Lipscomb goes to capitol hill is undeniably moving, and much of the ""found footage"" (Bush in the classroom reading ""My Pet Goat,"" the unforgettable ""Now watch this drive"" scene) is great, and many of the individual scenes (the opening, homeland security) are well done.\n\nThe DVD has the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Since a startling amount of this movie is grainy news footage, there really isn't much the DVD can (or should) do. Suffice to say, the image looks good enough. The real value of the DVD is in the extras. Some of the extras, especially the scene with Condelleza Rice (""I believe it was called 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the US'"") and the documentary about Arab American comedians. The worst extra is about the release of the film, which is fifteen solid minutes of people saying what a great guy Michael Moore is - dull, dull, dull! Another extra worth checking out is the theatrical trailer, which is surprisingly effective.";Excellent Propaganda but a Middling Film
300;1415.0;3.0;6.0;The things I can admit to in this movie is that it is extremely well done the editing is quite perfect and the movie is a great documentary, if it wasn't for the fact that i totally disagree with the subject i guess the movie would get the four stars from me for sure.\n\nIf you're a smart person you would be able to see as I do and the mojority of Americans (since they realected George Bush) that the facts that Michael has presented to you in his latest documentary, the facts that supposably cut all corners and cover everything that George Bush really is are twisted facts they have been edited in a hundred different areas to present the best possible argument to drop the bomb on George Bush and even with all the intewiews and facts he presented, if you have watched the news are countered in a thousand different ways to suggest that Michael is just a big luni who needs a proper job rather than stir up trouble.\n\nIn the movie he interviews about three American soldiers (all teenagers by the way) and asks them what they feal as they're shooting down the enemy in the meen time he has the song burn mother!!!!burn.\n\nAnyways I suggest that you watch the movie for yourself and review your own personal fealings, i still suggest that you watch the movie and hopefully you're not dumd enough to be sucked in aswell.;Open your eye's America!!!!!!
404;1416.0;3.0;6.0;"I enjoyed all the well deserved Bush bashing, but this is hardly a documentory. That's fine, but while it offers a different perspective on the war people are too quick to say ""this is the truth!"". How can you possibly discuss foreign policies in the middle east without mentioning Israel and its ties with the US ?? The fact is that Michael wasn't so much concerned with the truth, but more so with defeating Bush. Any negative comment on Israel would have worked against this goal. Sad, but true.";Good, but not documentory

I heard statements that BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE is an anti-gun movie, when actually it is an exploration of the conditions in our society that make violent crime so high. Incidently, Michael Moore is a member of the NRA himself.\n\nIn Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore does make statements that are hard to believe. Still, it is worth it for every person to watch and think for themselves. Why did some documents released from Bush's guard duty days have names blotted out, and what connection did the persons with these names have to the Bushes and the oil industry? What connection has there been with them and the Bush family in the past few years?  What is this nonsense about a ""Coaltion of the Willing""? Truthfully most of the countries listed in this coalition participate little but in name.  Why aren't GWB's children, members of Congress, or rich kids fighting this war instead of kids from the lower and middle classes? These are some of the key things to get out of this video.\n\nMichael Moore was one of few persons with the guts to question motives for this war before it started.  He was right, there was no WMD. Since he was right his opinions should be heard.  Watch this movie and BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE.  Both movies make you think, which is what those idiots that say these movies are trash don't want you to do.";Worth watching to see another point of view.
481;1418.0;1.0;6.0;The truth is that this is nowhere close to an accurate, objective documentary. It attempts to bash President Bush without realizing he has implemented successful and beneficial policies while in office. No president has been perfect. Many presidents have had to make the tough pronouncement of war. Michael Moore has no respect for the country or what the president has on his shoulders, and it comes through in this film. I wholeheartedly ask you to not consider this as truth or as the whole picture.;Half-Truths and Blatant Lies
527;1419.0;1.0;6.0;"The lies and far-fetched subject of his new movie is just a micro-cosm of what this man really feels.  Instead of making a documentary with at least some fact behind it, Mr. Moore has made what is essentially a ""Hate Bush"" Movie and filled it with lies.

586;1423.0;3.0;6.0;"Alright for the most part this is a failry decent movie and attack on Bush. I myself support Bush but i still saw this movie to see the other side. There are a few moments where the film got funny when Bush was first in office and they asked him what hes goin to do and he responds "" Well you'll see im singing stuff and making some decisions, you'll see."" Now that got me cracking up, but while he was firts in office there realy is not a lot you can do ohter then sit there so i don't blame the man.\n\n  However when Bush found out abut the attacks while he was in that classroom he did just sit there when he found out, yet by his face expresions he appeared to be in shock. Perosnally i thnk anyone would be also. He did not look to intrested in reading that book anymore and appeared he was thinking on what he could do. Now This movie was only made for Bush to look bad and there are plenty of good things to say about the guy, even tho this war in Iraq is complete crap, at least let Bush finish what he started and not let Kerry take over and try to finish it becuase that will lead toa failed mission.\n\n  I still support President Bush this movie only shows the bad, well if i were anyoen also look at the flip side because im sure there is a lot of good just not seen.";Not a Bad movie but some points that are missed out on
662;1424.0;5.0;6.0;Should be required viewing for every American. Infuriating. Funny. Entertaining. Heartbreaking. One can agree or disagree with Moore, but this is a powerful film. A little overlong, perhaps, but a must see documentary. Thank God, for Michael Moore!;GREAT!

27;1426.0;4.0;5.0;"""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an outstanding documentary covering some of the general facts and questions about 9/11.  The movie even goes so far as to examine the thoughts and feelings of the soldiers during the advent of the ""war on terror"" and does a good job of getting footage of the Iraqi people after the initial devestation of their cities.\n\nMoore couples witty humor with poignient moments and keen insight into the motivations and tactics of the leaders who are the faces of the elite running this war.\n\nMy only problem with the movie is that it is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is so much more confirmed information that was left out of the movie.  However, I know that the general public in the very least was exposed to the many questions presented in this movie and, perhaps, started the journey down the rabbit hole into exploring more obvious questions from 9/11.\n\nAs a starter into 9/11 conspiracy research, this movie is a good foundation.";Great film for the general public, but just the tip of the iceberg...
827;1427.0;3.0;6.0;I had the chance to view the movie for the first time on 9/23/04. I thought it was well done but contained a lot of fiction for a so called documentary. I recommend it only if you do your homework on the issues before watching the movie. If you choose to watch the movie before you do your research accept most information as fiction until your homework is done. Michael Moore is also a brilliant opportunist. He knows the sheep on the right and the left will either be outraged or in love with his movie. WHICH MEANS BIG BUCKS FOR HIM.;Brilliant Opportunist Ficumentary
1011;1428.0;3.0;6.0;You really have to be a fan of Michael Moores style to appreciate his way of presenting facts. F-911 is definitely watchable, but does drag a little at the 90 minute mark, but then proceeds to almost 2 hours.  While the information (or facts) presented affect all of us, the film will have more meaning to Americans.  Your president, afterall.  Not to say that John Howard is any better, mind you.;Interesting, but does drag at times
1041;1429.0;4.0;6.0;Michael Moore has never been secretive about his biases so the criticism of Fahrenheit 9/11 did not influence my decision to either see or not see the film.  I knew that it would be anti-Bush but I saw it with an open mind (although half expecting to be played with by Moore's clever but not always honest portrayal of what he sees as the truth).  I was impressed with the film because it does raise some interesting questions, and it did make me want to go out and verify some of Moore's claims independently.  On face value Moore's film is about exploring the (sometimes sinister) machinations of big business and big government.  However, I felt that above all that this was very personal for Moore.  Here is a man who is angry about the result of the 2000 election, shocked and saddened by the September 11th attacks and bitter about his government's response, in particular the war in Iraq.  And while it may sound trite, thank God we have the freedom to openly criticise and question the powers that be.;See it with an open mind
1175;1430.0;4.0;6.0;"The biggest difference in Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, in contrast with other documentaries, is that it does not bother with the customary phony facade of objectivity.\n\n Most documentaries are politically motivated propaganda meant to lead their viewers to false or distorted impressions, by what they emphasize, by what they leave out, by speculation or rumor insinuated to be proven fact, etc. One common trick is to speak the truth as it were through a mouthful of garbage so that it seems to emerge with a stinking odor that causes most listeners to disbelieve it. Or to set up a villain (actually, an actor) who speaks the truth with his tongue obviously in cheek, so that the listener will get the impression that he is being lied to. The producers of ""historical"" documentaries know a thousand tricks of deception, and outright lying is only one of them.\n\n Michael Moore must be aware that the public falls for the slick tricks that are standard fare in other people's documentaries. He simply did not use them. You know right away that he doesn't like the president. Rather than condemn him for ""hating"" Bush, at least appreciate that he didn't hide his personal opinions, as many other, less honest propagandists, usually do.";The real difference is forthrightness
1176;1431.0;5.0;6.0;Thank you Michael Moore for having the interest and courage to do this film.  I think all Americans should see it, it's wonderful.  I have always seen President Bush as shady and uncaring and have always felt something was wrong with his Administration.  This film tells the truth and is quite humorous as well.  I loved it and I will own several dvd's of it when it is released.  See it, you won't regret it.;A freat film
1201;1432.0;5.0;6.0;Farenheit 9/11 probably will not change any voter's minds, but it still is an excellent documentary with great direction and scathing humor, and still has time to leave a huge emotional impact on the moviegoer. I loved this film and for me, it was one of the most important films that I have ever seen. It is still propaganda, but it is propaganda with facts.;An Excellent Documentary!
1205;1433.0;4.0;6.0;Upon the release of Fahrenheit 911, Michael Moore has arguably established himself as the answer of moderates and liberals to the likes of Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThough many are outraged about the allegations of Fahrenheit 911, and perhaps rightfully so, it is not so apparent that there have been deliveries from the most outspoken voices of the GOP that have answered Moore's indictments in this film with strong, highly reasonable, clearly expressed responses. From what I see and hear on most of FOX News and the like, the only discussions from neocon pundits, including Ann Coulter, Joe Scarborough and Sean Hannity, center around name calling and portraying Moore as an anti-patriot who is aiding the terrorists without effectively deconstructing the perceived merits and flaws of Moore's documentary.\n\nI do agree that this film is slanted, but the so-called extenuating circumstances that critics have tried to espouse in defense of the Bush White House hold very little weight. And who are these critics? Again, Coulter and company.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There are annoyances from the leftist view, but when you have guys like Savage, Hannity and Limbaugh espousing their venom under the guise of news talk radio, leaving little room, if any, for other points of view, perhaps for those other opinions to receive any undivided, uninterrupted attention this documentary had to come out.\n\nI often wish that we could have some scholarly, well-informed, well-balanced discussions on a regular basis. I think that the conservatives would serve themselves well if they had more of the intelligent analysts like George Will, William Buckley, and Bill Kristol. They might not be the most exciting, but they do not go off foaming at the mouth, indoctrinating one-half of a nation that they have, in essence, divided.\n\nOh, yes. Our nation is divided. It does not help when you watch programs where the so-called moderator allows one guest to voice, essentially, the moderator's sentiments in full and then join this first guest in double-teaming against the dissenting party, not allowing this second guest to complete the first two sentences without being interrupted. Again, I think that what has been happening on certain programs on MSNBC, CNBC, FOX, and various outlets has contributed to the popularity of Fahrenheit 911, because it is one rare source that one can hear some degree of satire about President Bush.\n\nThere were promises of uniting as opposed to dividing, but this juvenile attitude that one is so much more entitled to put others down than the next person is creating a rift. It especially is troublesome when idealogues are so full of themselves that they communicate as if they do not have to heed the facts, especially if the facts do not agree with their perceived standards. If they saw Fahrenheit 911, they might conclude deep down inside that Moore has managed to hold a mirror that reflects their arrogance.;A Thought-Provoking Display of Uncompromising Liberalism
1211;1434.0;5.0;6.0;I have see this movie four times and each time I come away with something new to think about. Moore FINALLY puts to rest the hyped connection between Al Qaeda and 9/11 despite the best intentions of the current administration to keep this lie afloat. I feel that the movie also presents a fair assessment of our military, many of whom question the very War they find themselves in. I think that every thoughtful and truth seeking American should see this movie, particular younger people . They'll be the ones to suffer from our bellicose foreign policy.;Powerful and Scathingly Funny
1215;1435.0;1.0;6.0;"This is I think the most important political movie in years. Some might call the film controversial, it is not for the Democrat leadership. A long list of Democrats is very positive about the movie. Senator Bob Graham (Democrat) told the New York Times at its premier in Washington: ""there might be half the Democratic Senate here."" And indeed a lot of prominent Democrats where seen and interviewed by the press during the premier party of Fahrenheit 9/11. Tom Daschle (Democrats leader in Congress) was seen, as was Barbara Boxer and Terry McAuliffe (Democratic National Committee chairman). Terry was asked by CNN, ""Do you think the movie was essentially fair and factually based?"", answer: ""I do"".\n\n Kerrie's daughter event went to the world premier of the movie in France, where she was seen in her see through dress (...). But Kerry him self says he did not see it and does not need see the movie, because ""I've watched it for the last four years."" (CNN)\n\n This leads me to think that this movie will show you a worldview that is representative for the majority of the Democratic Party leadership. In an US election year, that alone makes it a very important and powerful movie.\n\n In a lot of other reviews or on ""Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11"" by David Kopel you can see that the film is not very accurate on facts and is also not very consistent in it self. It is basically floats on (bad) feelings about American politics. As a European this leads me to our very own history. In World War II, it was the first time we created mass movements by mass media means. I never could really empathize of how the people in that time get all so energized with hatred by propaganda that was so out of touch with reason and facts, it all seems based on the most primary feelings. I always wondered, how this could prevail in a Western civilization that was made big by the contribution of reason?\n\n Fahrenheit 9/11 has an obvious and blunt disregards for facts and reason (the film even contradicts it self often), so I was shocked to see the alignment of the Democratic Party leadership with it. A more accurate reaction came from the Wall street Journal, they called Michael Moore the Leni Riefenstahl of our time. Although I thinks that is a bit over the top, Leni Riefenstahl, did something unique and did not have the knowledge of History, Michael Moore definitely knows history and uses it.\n\n Go see this movie, the Democratic Party reveals it self!";Feelings generate the truth!
1324;1436.0;4.0;6.0;"I would give the movie 5 stars but it was not quite as viscerally entertaining as I had been lead to believe by the ""buzz"" surrounding this movie.  For example, the 7 minutes of Bush sitting there reading a book about Goats after the second plane struck the WTC is not as compelling on film as I had expected.\nOn the other hand, I agree with everything said in this film (except how unemployment is calculated) and I think a lot of it just needs to be said.  I don't think that Bush and Bin Laden conspired to wage war exactly and Moore doesn't say this, but the family ties between the Bushes and the Saudis is a story that has been ignored for the most part by the mainstream press.\nI really liked the ending and his conclusion that perhaps war is being waged as a way of suppressing the lower classes, how the lower class produces the people willing to fight to preserve the property and freedoms of the upper class.  I have been thinking much the same thing about the Bush changes to the federal tax code, which force working people to pay for the federal government while taxes on unearned income (dividends, capital gains, inheritances) are taxed less and less.";Not as entertaining as I expected, but still good
1373;1437.0;5.0;6.0;"Just came back from seeing this movie; my wife and I thought it was outstanding! Those people who would argue the merits of the Iraq war based upon political affiliation are way off base. This is a question or right versus wrong, not liberal versus conservative. I strongly urge everyone to go see this movie. If you take only one thing with you as you leave the theatre, let it be the idea that you can't always believe what you read in the newspaper or what you see on the t.v. news shows. While I don't think that the movie connects all of the dots correctly, it magnifies enough of the dots where the viewer can than do a little investigating themselves. Don't simply believe the critics in the media who say this movie is a waste of time. See the movie, then check the facts yourself.

With sometimes satirical narration by the man himself, we get a glimpse at the administration of George W. Bush, from the 2000 Florida election debacle to post-9/11 hysteria and the invasion of Iraq that has cost the lives of close to one thousand of our soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians so far.  The Bush/Bin Laden connections; Dick Cheney's Haliburton past; the complicity of the news media in rallying support around this war, particularly with respect to Fox News; the passage of the now-venal so-called ""Patriot Act"" without a single objection in either house of Congress--all of these things and more are bought out in savage detail.  For me, the most troubling and disturbing moment in FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the sequence in which Bush is reading to kids in the school in Florida at the moment one of his aides tells him of the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower--and we look at his glassy stare.  Some have merely chalked it up to showing a brave face on Bush's part; others chalk it up to his supposed ineptness.  I didn't feel either way, though.  I could see the wheels turning in his mind--that with the World Trade Center now nothing but a seven-story pile of rubble, he had been given the perfect excuse to launch a war.\nIt is very easy for Bush's supporters to say this film and its creator are both unpatriotic, that it is slanted so far to the left that it isn't even worth the time to comment.  But from the opening moments of the Iraq war, those same supporters, with the complicit help of right-wingers like the Fox News Channel and blowhards like Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh have shoved plenty of their own propoganda down the throats of the American people under the guise of patriotism, freedom, and democracy.  And NONE OF THEM has EVER served in combat.  Not one.  But they have no problem sending poor or working-class kids over there to get killed for a slogan.  Those are questions Moore is asking and demanding straightforward answers to, and that's what makes him a true patriot.  His film merely serves to balance the scales, and if it means turning the far right's apple cart totally over, then so be it.  This is what America is all about.\nHowever one feels about Bush or America or Michael Moore himself, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 demands to be seen at least once.  It demands us to ask of ourselves how we got to where we are now, and how we can get back on track to make this nation of ours great once more.  Any film that can ask the tough questions and provoke such a firestorm of response is, for me personally, a masterpiece of the highest order.  So it is with FAHRENHEIT 9/11.";Infuriating, Provocative--In Short, An American Masterpiece
1375;1439.0;5.0;6.0;I almost didn't go to see this because I had been told there were a lot of mangled bodies of Iraqi women and kids and maimed American soldiers. Well, there is some of that, but it's perhaps 10 minutes total in a two-plus-hour film. This takes the high points of  everything I have gathered about Bush and the war over the past couple of years and puts it into a video package. It's even funny in spots, which is a good trick given how grim the subject is. Take a friend to see this.;Less violence on screen than I was led to believe
1380;1440.0;5.0;6.0;"Michael Moore has powerfully and artistically documented the follies, faults, and vindictiveness of the Bush regime.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is an exhaustive collection of snippets of interviews, speeches, war footage, and news reports that cohesively serve one purpose - to convince moviegoers that Bush has got to go.  I can honestly say that very few movies have impacted me as much as Fahrenheit 9/11 (another movie to consider watching is Afghanistan's first movie after the fall of the Taliban named ""Osama"").  However, Fahrenheit does not come without its fair share of faults.  I found the filmto be closed-minded, and I felt that some of the facts/events/speeches were taken out of context.  Yet, its only natural that Michael Moore does that.  Moreover, I felt that Moore was trying to denounce Saudi Arabia because they ""owned 6-7% of America.""  He criticizes the Bush regime for their pampering of the Saudi Arabian ambassador in order to propagate that Bush was after oil and resources.  Yet, Moore (perhaps unknowingly) shows that he's hypocritical because he denounces America's cruel actions in the Middle East while he himself denounces the economic activities of Saudi Arabia.  Aside from these flaws, the film's power of influence never ceases to amaze me.  Critics of the film will find that Moore's film is no better than the Bush regime in terms of brainwashing.  However, one cannot argue that the numerous true facts presented in Moore's movie campaign speak for themselves.";4.5 Stars (Powerful Movie with Minor Flaws)

This is MM's best work, IMHO. But, I must admit that it WAS slanted. although, this doesn't take away from the experience. He does NOT slant where it is important (like the mother's reaction, and the angered Iraqis). Although I am not sure if his coalition facts are straight.

1418;1442.0;4.0;6.0;Watching this, I was often reminded of the conspiracy theories I hear about on the radio shows of some Religious Right nut cases. The pattern is the same. Some very interesting facts and personal relationships which are normally obscured from the general public are brought to the forefront of our attention. Then, our host makes all sorts of cross connections between them to prove his pre-decided conclusions. Contrary evidence is ignored. Threadbare connections are given much more significance than they're due. Casual, incidental aquaintances are portrayed as tightly coordinated planners. Then, voila! You have a worldwide conspiracy out to dupe the public! Moore reminds us that the Religious Right don't have a monopoly on this sort of thinking. But there's a problem. You can't dismiss all of Moore's conclusions as paranoia. Some of them are true. But which, and how many? This is our puzzle. Moore brings up many facts that can't be ignored. They cry out to be connected. But which of these connections are valid? How much does it really fit together, and how much is wishful thinking? Moore does much of his connecting through emotional rhetoric and innuendo. Time and again, we must decide for ourselves how many of his links can be trusted. There's our task. As for the movie's over all style, it's typical Moore, which I happen to enjoy on a visceral level. He can still splice together very selective quotes and scenes to serve up a big helping of delicious irony. Many of his points are old liberal boilerplates. I don't need him to tell me that war is horrifically cruel to civilians, that the poor do the fighting and dieing, that certain groups and companies profit off war, and that W is a dimwit. And I certainly didn't need all those ugly extreme facial closeups. To show the Iraq war was unjustified, he uses the same arguments the anti-war people have been using for a year and a half. Not that they're wrong arguments. He just adds nothing new to the debate. The viewer's mind will not be changed after this. Still, all those facts .... It's time we sweep aside his implied connections and do our own connecting. There's still a chance he's right. This movie is a challenge to us all to investigate the facts, come to our own conclusions, and act on them. Don't ignore the challenge of this movie.;Connecting some interesting dots, Moore style
1425;1443.0;4.0;6.0;"Let's clear up a few things with this movie. Does Moore have an agenda? Of course he does. His agenda is to get Bush out of office. Is the movie one-sided? Yes, as the Bush administration is not seen in any sort of positive light in the movie. Is the movie therefore devoid of any political and educational value? Not in the least. Moore and Miramax have stated on numerous occassions that the facts of this film were checked, re-checked, and checked again, and it shows. In theory, you could save your money and just find archives of all the stories that contributed to the facts of this movie. There are also important interviews with former FBI and congressional members in the film as well.\nEven if you are a die-hard conservative/Bush supporter who feels that Moore's views are without merit, fine. Lord knows conservatives aren't the most open-minded people. However,  you can't ignore the FACTS that are presented in this film, nor can you ignore the footage of the soldiers and Iraqis that are shown here. The casualties of this war are even greater than the fatalities, as you will see soldiers missing limbs and suffering permanent physical/mental damage from the war, which is the kind of stuff the major news outlets seem reluctant to show.\nTalking about the media, if you wonder why every news station is making their own ""Does Fahrenheit's Facts Check Out?"" segment, its not because they really have evidence of false facts, but rather they're just covering their own butts because the media is shown in quite a negative light in this film, especially Fox News. They're covering up shoddy reporting by attacking Moore (anyone who saw Matt Lauer's interview with Moore can attest to that.)\nThis film is more aimed towards people who really don't know about what's going on in our government. I brought my friend who's never been political about anything to see this and he was appalled when he learned what was going on. To be fair, anyone who sees this movie needs to realize that this is still just one side of the story, and should not base all of their political thinking on it. Still, knowledge is truly power, and the power attained from seeing this movie is very real and tangible. And for all those nay-sayers who say that the film is full of lies, all I have to say is: Prove it. Don't just say, ""The film isn't entirely accurate,"" give me pure EXAMPLES of how this is so. It should be noted that all of these sorts of criticisms have been disproven by Moore, including a high profile one in Newsweek. I'd highly recommend that you go to Moore's web site to learn more.\nIn conclusion, this film is a scathing view of the current administration, and these views are ""justified"" via facts/interviews/information throughout the movie. Not everything is cut and dry in it, but it definately leaves you with something to talk about. I recommend everyone see this movie, and to bring all your friends/family as well. And don't give me the excuse that ""I don't care about the government"" or ""This film will just make me cry/angry."" Just because you ignore these issues does NOT mean they are simply going to go away. You owe it to yourself as a citizen to know what it is the government is doing on your behalf. Remember, our government, and especially our President, are our representatives to the rest of the world. We elect them to represent us, so you owe it to yourself to check that they are faithfully representing you, so that you can make the decision in November whether or not to keep them in office or to kick them out. And on a side note, if you haven't already, REGISTER TO VOTE! I don't care if u vote for Bush or Kerry or Nader, but lets at least have it so that more than 50% of the country is voting in this next election.";Don't hide from the truth.
1453;1444.0;5.0;6.0;"There's little that's brand new in Mr. Moore's well-crafted documentary, but it brings together a great deal of information (most of which is in the public record) in thought-provoking ways, with a personal and occasionally humorous touch. The result is thoroughly entertaining and moving. I've already heard the movie being decried by ultra-conservatives as ""full of lies"" (odd considering that that was *before* the release), but in fact the line is mostly quite clear between the well-documented facts and Moore's own conclusions. This is a movie that everyone, liberal or conservative or neither, should see for its clear-eyed view of the facts and its up-close interviews with everyday Americans and Iraqis who have suffered terrible losses.";Thoughtful and Entertaining

1468;1447.0;5.0;6.0;Farenheit 911 had the audience applauding and booing as they watched. I had seen many of the news clips he included, however they had been limited on TV.  Moore gave more footage to the events which had a fuller and more significant meaning.  In the past 4 years there have been so many events not shared with the public by mainstream media. It is so important for citizens to have open dialogue which this movie encourages. We don't have to all agree, but we should be able to work with the facts and not the spin of fear. I highly recommend ALL citizens should see this movie AND vote.  Think of what is at stake.;Do something. The truth can set you free.
1476;1448.0;5.0;6.0;This was the best movie I've seen in years!  Compelling and insightful, it stirs every emotion from sympathy to rage.  Perhaps most importantly it fits together all the pieces of this administration's corruption into one vivid, chilling puzzle.;Everyone must see this film!
33;1449.0;3.0;5.0;"Jeeze ... this film has become such a lightening-rod, I'd like to be as careful as I can in my review to leave my own political opinions out of it.\n\nThere were certain things I wanted to see when I sat down to watch the film. I've always felt that in a documentary, structure and integrity are absolutely critical to the success of the piece. That may sound fairly obvious, but Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' took a LOT of liberties with a TON of the facts it was using to build it's argument as well as jumping all over the place, subject wise (Tim McVey/NRA/gun control/urban violence/Lockheed Martin/the media/K-Mart ... dammit Mike ... pick one and stick with it). I wanted to see it demonstrated that Moore was past that and trusted his facts enough to present his argument.\n\nSo how did he do? Well ... it's better then 'Columbine.' I still think Moore hit his high-water mark with 'Roger and Me,' but it IS better then the irresponsible 'Columbine.' For the most part, it passed the smell test. On Moore's web-site he made sure to present the sources he used for his information so the audience could see where he was drawing his conclusions from.\n\nGranted, several facts have since been de-bunked by the 9-11 commission, but GENERALLY speaking he's much more accurate here then 'Columbine' was in its best moment. The habit that Moore seems to have developed that drives me crazy though, is that he's too prone to (not always, but sometimes) build a particular argument on HIS INTERPRETATION OF facts, instead of the facts themselves. This occasionally leads Moore to start getting really carried away with a few of his conspiracy theories (... a pipeline though the middle-east?).\n\nThe thing that Moore really has a genuine knack for, is capturing the ridiculous side of human nature and being able to make people laugh at themselves during the worst of times. I'm thinking of the segments with the ""office parachute"" or the sealed ""anti-terrorist pot-a-john."" There's not enough though, I would have loved it if we had seen more of Moore's particular brand of ""gallows humor.""\n\nI'm still of the opinion that Moore still jumps subjects too quickly. I'd love for him to just sit down and make a film on JUST the 2000 presidential election or JUST FOX New's right-wing bias or JUST the way fear is used by the media in today's society. As it is, in Fahrenheit, Moore tries to cover every subject and as a result, some incredibly interesting work winds up feeling half-finished.\n\nWhile watching this, realize that it needs to be taken as an Op/Ed piece.  If you do that, the whole film instantly becomes much better. For Bush supporters, you have to realize that this piece is NOT the least bit ""fair or balanced"" as Fox News would say. For the Left, you also need to remember that Moore very clearly HAS an agenda and he's been proven in the past to be a little loose with the truth to make his point. Just because it's such an open-handed slap at Bush, doesn't automatically mean that it's good. Don't be afraid to challenge Moore and to research his facts on you own. What you may learn will only strengthen your own convictions regardless of which side of the political coin you're on.\n\nThere-in lies the value in a piece such as this. As always, Moore's ""every-man"" image will incite people who may not normally follow the political process to get involved and educate themselves. The challenge for either side is to not just take it at face-value.";Take this for no more then what it is ...
40;1450.0;5.0;5.0;"""The man who fears no truth has nothing to fear from lies.""  Thomas Jefferson\n\nNo better example currently on DVD can be found proving Jefferson's timeless truth.  It is not the opinions or interpretations by Moore that his vociferous (compensating with volume for what they lack in numbers) detractors have a problem with, it is his undoing of millions of dollars worth of corporate propaganda and censorship by his exposition of facts.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the original ""inconvenient truth"", inconveniencing right-wingers, a complicit media, and derelict journalists alike with a litany of non-repudiated inconvenient facts such as: the billions of dollars of Saudi investments in American real estate and business and Bush's cozy relationship with some of those investors, the Saudi billionaire bin Laden family and the supposed black-sheep member of their family, anti-Russian-CIA-operative Osama, who strangely offered his assistance against Saddam Hussein when the latter threatened Saudi oil by invading Kuwait, the many bizarre and now notorious events preceding and following 9/11, etc, etc.\n\nThe corporate media monopoly takes a major hit by Moore's exposure of facts they deliberately excluded, as does the post 9/11 reality they had created for mass consumption.  How does Moore's famous video-clip of Bush staring like a deer trapped in a hunter's headlights after being informed of the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center gel with the media's heroic portrayal of the Great Leader, arm draped around a battle-weary firefighter, shouting soundbites from the 9/11 rubble?  People investing millions of dollars manufacturing 9/11 ""truth"" are not pleased.\n\nTHIS then, is the reason to see this film.  To see and hear facts, stats, and pictures that you have never, yet, seen or heard in the mainstream media, no matter how often they repeat the lie about their being liberal.  Whether you agree with Moore's often-implied opinions and interpretations of those facts is irrelevant.  (I, e.g., think too much was made over Bush's strange, possibly suspicious, stupefied stare.  However, in a country with a free press it would have received much media coverage.  Like most of the material in the movie, I had never seen it or heard about it before this movie!)\n\nMany people, of course, don't deserve to have a democracy and avoid the truth because, as Jack Nicholson famously memorialized to Tom Cruise (portraying military prosecutor Iglesias): ""You can't handle the truth!""\n\nAnd many are thankful that they have corporate media lackeys to protect them from the truth.  If you are not one of them, it is still not too late to see what the mainstream media does not want you to.";The Original Inconvenient Truth

86;1457.0;2.0;5.0;"I am not sure where to start with this movie, or this persuasive visually essay. After all, that is what it is. Anyone who states this movie is entire fact, despite political stripe, is really not being honest with himself or herself. Many of Michael Moore's arguments and positions on topics really follow a ""1 + 1 = 3"" formula. For instance Fahrenheit 9/11 opens with the Bush/Gore 2000 election. How different news channels weren't displaying solidarity with the results of the election. Then the film states how Bush stole Florida from Gore. How did Bush do this? Well his brother Jeb was the governor at the time, which is how! Now I am not saying that isn't shady, and I was living in Florida and voted in that election, I recall how crazy that entire process was. But you know how this entire situation could have been avoided? If Al Gore won Tennessee (his home state) and Arkansas (President Bill Clinton's home state, after all Gore worked with him for eight years). Had Gore won these states, he wouldn't have had to worry about Florida! Nevertheless, jolly old Michael Moore omits these types of facts throughout the entire film. I know many people on the right side of the fence were upset with this movie and feel it shouldn't have been made. My response to that notion is ""If you are that upset GOP, make your own movie.""\n\nAs for President George W. Bush, I have a question. Is he the dumbest kid on the street or is he the devil himself? Because I find myself getting really confused, I am not sure how he can be both. I imagine someone who is really evil to be very intelligent, not to be stupid. Consequently, President Bush seems to be both, as ominous as Hitler, but as dumb as Porky Pig. I am confused, but I think that is the ruse behind Moore's mix message in this movie.\n\nI want it to be understood I don't think Bush is the brightest crayon in the box, but I don't think the fault of the world is his pratfall. It just isn't one person who makes decisions in government; any college level course will explain that information to you. There are many shadowy and dark figures in American politics that are both Republican and Democrat. These factors fall into every element of contemporary America.\n\nAs for 9/11 itself, what a terrible thing to happen to any country, the fact it happened in New York City was unspeakable. I am able to say I had been to the WTC before and after the attack. Seeing the aftermath was quite moving, to think one of the greatest cites in the world became a target of hate and pain. As for the human-interest story about the solider that was killed and his mother coping, was touching. However, what about every soldier's family who had to deal with a death related to the War on Terror? Not just in this current war, but in every war that was ever fought? The bloody shirt technique was both moving and a low blow all at the same time. As I write this, I feel conflicted, but please remember that movie making has the magic of editing. Was that mother's pain fake, no? Was her son not a hero, of course he was. But every war has a casualty, which is why it is war. And for every mother, who is upset her son/daughter is involved with this war, there is another mother/father who is pleased her son/daughter is defending the United States. I think Michael Moore should have selected more than one family for his visually diatribe, what do you think?\n\nI suppose I understand Moore's plan, blame people here in the United States because after all if Al Gore were president we wouldn't have terrorists, right? If Al Gore were president we would all have better public schools, lower taxes and no crime, right?  Finally, if Al Gore were president there would be no plot against the United States, United Kingdom and other countries, in regards to blowing up public airlines? Right? Remember that the WTC was attacked back in 1993 by terrorists, when Bill Clinton was President. Just some food for thought.\n\nIn modern times, we as a country should stand together and be a democracy, blaming each other and falling apart is giving terrorists what they want.  Especially with all the horror going on with issues around the world today. My greatest concern is this; once Bush is out of office are we still going to be blaming him? Or are we going to be moving forward? There are still some hard core GOP members who still hate Bill Clinton for things that are wrong in this country. Come on people.\n\nIn conclusion, the moral of the story is don't believe everything you see on TV. This movie should be an inspiration for people everywhere to tap into their critical thinking skills. The problem with this country isn't Bush, Michael Moore or the War in the Middle East. It is that fact that more people are involved in voting for the next American Idol, not the next American President.";The magic of Moore
121;1458.0;2.0;5.0;"Michael Moore......a funny man with a funny cause. This movie is like a poor man's version of a Monty Python film. Moore takes some general ""facts"" about events related to the Bush administration and then procedes to fabricate some hilarious conclusions.\n\nI have to admit that I laughed quite a few times during this movie. The charges levied against our current administration are enjoyable because they are so reaching and ridiculously extreme that you can't help but chuckle. Unfortunately, Moore isn't kidding....he actually thinks he is uncovering something important!\n\nThere used to be a great series on tv called ""Connections"" by James Burke. In this series, Burke does a remarkable job of tying together seemingly unrelated events in history into an insightful understanding of the effects that disparate events have on each other and the future.\n\nWell......Moore attempts to do the same here, but he certainly lacks the keen, intellectual edge of Burke and his own clownish actions in the film take away from any legitimacy that he may be trying to portray.\n\nBesides, I've noticed a huge amount of hypocracy from many of these wealthier liberal types: while they bash corporations and greed and governments, they are simultaneously investing and earning huge sums of money from these very same entities. For example, Moore owns stock in the Halliburton Corporation. This is the very same company that he bashes with accusations of war profiteering based on past connections with Vice President Cheney.\n\nMany of our infamous liberal politician's and celebrities follow Moore's example. At the same time that they are leading the less educated and less informed down the path to liberal nirvana (socialism), they are cashing in big time in the same way that those naughty conservatives do - I guess their conscience looks the other way where wealth is concerned.\n\nOverall, this movie has some entertainment value as a comedy, and it has a great deal of monetary value for Moore....which was the real point of his making this film, not his ""patriotism"".";Funny....but it's no Monty Python!

148;1460.0;3.0;5.0;"Oscar-winner (""Bowling for Columbine"") Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an agitation propaganda documentary. You'll probably like it or not depending if you support John Howard and George W. Bush. Moore's agenda leaves no room for complex analysis of the evidence he uses to support his point of view. Instead we are treated to a 112-minute long blame game.\n\nMoore's film is a scathing political attack on the presidency of George W. Bush. The blank, vague look on his face much of the time speaks volumes. Especially when on September 11 2001, after been told a second plane had struck the World Trade Centre, he sat for seven minutes in a Florida kindergarten, reading ""My Pet Goat."" This footage was only available because the kindergarten teacher had her own video camera running.\n\nMuch of the film is about the murky connections between the Bush family, the bin Laden family (Osama bin Laden's father was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia), and the Saudi royal family. Interspersed with his footage of the grim reality of war, even the Arab news channel Al Jazeera would have shied away from. You get to see the devastating effect of supposed smart weapons on Iraqi children in brutal detail.\n\nAlthough Moore himself didn't go to Iraq, there is also extensive coverage of the US troops there, operating in and around Baghdad. They are in turn scared, angry at been there, and pumped full of adrenaline at getting to play with very big, dangerous toys. One sequence shows a patrol ridiculing a hooded detainee, one man (unlike the prison guards at Abu Ghraib, he was smart enough to wear a balaclava) sexually humiliating the prisoner.\n\nOne of the final powerful, though once again painful to watch, sequences was of grief stricken mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son Michael Pedersen had been killed in Iraq. His last letter home was full of anger at Bush, saying ""He got us here for nothing whatsoever."" In tears outside the Whitehouse a Bush supporter tells her she should be blaming Al Qaeda for the death of her son.\n\nMuch of this information is not new, but just isn't presented clearly by the news media. Here it is packaged in a way, has clearly sparked heated debate amongst Americans. A filmmaker who wasn't Michael Moore probably could have handled the material more deftly, and with much less hatred, but Moore gets across his anger to you. You will leave the cinema feeling like having a long talk with John Howard about getting the troops back now.";Propoganda Misfired

242;1463.0;4.0;5.0;Michael Moore is an unapologetically terrible person.  I am disgusted by his shameless exploitation of greif to sell a political message.  He is also unapologetically in love with himself, as evidenced by pulling this film from the Best Documentary category in hopes of winning a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 is a muddle, and the viewer is never entirely sure whether the film is accurate.  It also meanders from point to point haphazardly.\n\nSo why the four stars?  Because this is a fantastically entertaining movie.  I don't care how accurate Moore's research is, I don't care how self-indulgent the man is, and I don't care how overhyped this movie is.  It is still worth a watch, and is worth more than a little attention.  While Moore's politics are certainly exaggurated, his point is a valid one, and should be a caution to any concerned citizen.;Docutainment
284;1464.0;3.0;5.0;I watched this film last night, and having sympathy with many of Michael Moores views, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was in the end a little dissapointed. I felt the movie would have had a much stronger impact had it adopted a more neutral tone.\nMichael Moore's self-righteous pushing of his own agenda quickly became irritating, clouding many of the issue's he raised. Anyone with a reasonable knowledge of world events will have noticed him being economical with the truth (e.g. the omission of Britain from the coallition) with the sole purpose of manipulating emotions. I found this a little rich considering his scathing attacks on the US government's fear promotion tactics.\nNonetheless, this is an important film. These issues needed to be raised, it's just a shame a greater focus wasn't place on the facts in hand rather than Moore's own anger.;Wasted opportunity
295;1465.0;4.0;5.0;"i don't think anyone is going to refer to michael moore as being impartial or dead-pan in his moviemaking style.  keep in mind that this movie is no more emotionally manipulative than a bush campaign commercial; it just hits you in a different way.  the fact that someone out there finally had the gumption to let out a loud, unforgiving, blustery scream for accountability in the halls of power is what's most admirable here.\n\ncontrary to popular belief, the bold faced lies that the self-righteous right likes to rant and rave about are few and far between in this movie.  there is emotionally manipulative footage, yes.  but emotional manipulation is what it takes to get people to change their minds, even if it's for their own good.  it would be easy to make a clean, objective documentary about the dismal failure that is the bush administration; heck, the facts sure are there.  sadly, the vast majority of americans can't be bothered with that or drawing their own conclusions and as such, the bush campaign was very effective this fall as it relied on many of the same tactics as michael moore's movie.  john kerry and the democratic campaign played it safe and avoided character assasination, exaggeration, under-the-table sponsorship of ""non-partisan"" activist groups and all the other bullsh*t the RNC has down to a fine art and they lost, obviously.  if it's never been crystal-clear before, it is in this day and age: now is not the time for subtlety.  despite all this, the case made against bush amidst all of the unnecessary footage is about as solid as you can get.  check out michael moore's website for a blow-by-blow factual backup of every last claim in this movie including sources.  even i was surprised at the amount of fact-checking that went into it.  zell miller's speech at the republican national convention had more truth stretching in it than this movie by a long shot.\n\nmake no mistake about it, fahrenheit 9/11 hits you at a gut, visceral level. it does not shy away from the full-on carnage and gore of the iraq war when most news cameras would cut away.  this movie is simply fighting fire with fire; there are no opposing viewpoints in it at all because the same tactics are being utilized by the republican party to try to convert people although there are many, many more lies necessary to make their case.  it only makes sense that the right wing would hate this movie with all of its fury seeing as to how it was released during a pivotal election year.  calling it an attempt to slander the president is a cop-out; a weak answer to such a stunning piece of art as well as telling commentary on the direction of the political winds of our time.  there is no slander in this movie.  everything that appears in fahrenheit 9/11 is real and sums up the post-9/11 world that we live in today. there's no need for him to make a damn thing up; it's happening right in front of our eyes.\n\nno matter how you slice it, michael moore is only doing what any concerned american would do.  blind acceptance and trust in any administration has and always will mark the downfall of a free people.  if you love michael moore, if you hate michael moore, or if you just don't know yet, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  it received standing ovations in my home (and very red) state of north carolina, and that says a lot.  the endless, brain-dead blather about michael moore being unpatriotic or un-american has to stop.  this is america; it is our job to preserve the good name and legacy of her for future generations.  this movie just might be the first baby step toward achievement of that goal.";mixes documentary and propaganda but engages from the start
315;1466.0;5.0;5.0;Most of u people think that Moore is just making fun of bush. Your wrong.  He is just expressing his views on how Bush reasponded to 9/11.  Also alot of you people think that the info in the film is fake.  Its not.  Moore has 3 lawyers that say that is true.  If you can provide info to show thats its true then i will believe you.;u people are wrong
320;1467.0;5.0;5.0;An entertaining yet insightful look at the 9/11 tragedy and its aftermath. Michael Moore informs, shocks, saddens and amuses the viewer with an amazing documentary that challenges the facts as we (think we) know them and cuts through the spin. Even if you don't like the director or are a die-hard republican, the film is a must see. It is worth every second.;Amazing piece of work
329;1468.0;4.0;5.0;"The name of this film might suggest a study of 9/11 and the events and people surrounding it, but make no mistake about it, the one person that Moore is going after is George W. Bush.  And everything in this film was contructed to instigate Dubya's donwfall.\n\nWell, let me clarify the word ""constructed"".  Most people tend to fall on either side of the fence when it comes to this movie, the conservatives would say it's all liberal propaganda, and the liberals would hail Moore as the champion of undisputed truth.  To be fair, they are both right, and they are both wrong.  If you'd just keep a clear head as you watch this movie, and do a little research yourself, you'll find that Moore does manipulate history to mislead people's thinking, but there are also areas that's been well researched and supported.  Examples: While Moore pointed out that the Bin Ladens in America were the only ones allowed to fly immediately after 9/11, they were in fact put on flights one week after normal air travels had resumed in the country; on the other hand, the Bush family's strong business ties with the Bin Ladens and the Saudis are very well documented by other sources and dates back to Bush senior.  So when I use the word ""contructed"", I don't mean Moore had gone ahead to invent fictional facts for the purpose of his political agenda, but rather, he has found a way to creatively and artistically put together the truthes and the half-truthes in a presentation against Bush.\n\nIs it a good documentary, hmm, debatable.  It's very opionated and by no means fair-handed.  Moore does build a strong case against Bush, criticising his character flaws and delivers seemingly a mountain of evidence on his questionable relationship with the Saudis.  He stops just short of implicating Bush in the attach itself, although I doubt he would mind if his audience was being led down that path.  Is this a good movie?  Sure.  I found it to be both insightful and entertaining at the same time.  Moore is a skilled filmmaker, and knows how to find humorous and yet revealing angles to tackle an issue.\n\nLove him or hate him, Moore and ""Fahrenheit 911"" probably has helped to inspire a new level of civic enthusiasm that's unseen in this country for many years, manifesting itself in the high level of voter turnout at this last election, ironically, the result was probably much to his chagrin.";Don't Believe Everything That You See
393;1469.0;2.0;5.0;"Obviously, Michael Moore wanted to make a provocative film, and ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" succeeds on that score: Endless debate has centered on this film. However, I was surprised by how leaden it was compared to his more entertaining (and effective) ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Roger and Me.""  Although some scenes were undeniably powerful - such as interviews with the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, other sections did not work very well, particularly snippets of political speeches taken out of context.\n\nHowever, to me, the biggest flaw was Moore's mixed messages about the armed forces. He repeatedly hammers home the message that the men and women sent to Iraq are from poor neighborhoods and signed up because of a lack of other opportunities in their lives, making them sympathetic.  However, in interviews with soldiers in Iraq, he depicts them as ruthless killing machines - carelessly killing Iraqi civilians while listening to Drowning Pool.  Why does Moore undermine his message so severely?\n\nOverall, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a middling documentary, but the fact that it was so successful cannot be denied. The American public was seeking out in a film the answers they didn't think they were getting from politicians and even the media. Perhaps that's the legacy of this film, especially as it seems so outdated already, just weeks after the election.";No Moore
464;1470.0;3.0;5.0;If you don't know by now Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentary about Why the Bush family should not be in America or presidency. Michael Moore attacks with video and film footage on the history of the Bush family and its ties with the Saudi family. Michael Moore starts with the senior Bush and then goes after President Bush by using suggestive ties between the Saudis and Bush families.\n\nThe director tries to use film clips with commentary to convince the viewer that President George W. Bush is guilty by association and corrupted by oil money. Greed from the highest position in the land is thrown into convincing fashion by film and research facts. Can this hold up in a court of law? Probably not! I'm sure this film would be part of the evidence collected to bring down President George W. Bush if it was brought up in a court of law.\n\nThe director would have us believe that President Bush is not American by his ties with the Saudis. I believe the true purpose of this film is to bring down the current President Bush's regime and vanish the Bush name to corruption. Michael Moore does have some balls to take on the President Bush though. Its one thing to take on the NRA, but the highest and most powerful person in the world!\n\nOnly in American can a film director take on the most powerful leader in the world and get away with it. I believe if all of this was true of the Bush family with its billions and billions of dollars at stake in oil and secrecy held in trust, that President Bush or his family keeps it a secret by using his so called influence. Maybe a disappearing act!  Would the Bushes let a documentary film director film and distribute a film with all this bashing of the family name? If this was true!\n\nWith the majority of the media already under the influence of political parties, can a blatant attack on President George W. Bush by a filmmaker be crushed before it was made? Of course it could. Maybe the political hype and influence in film was underestimated by the Bush family as comes with the territory. Can a film bring down a presidency? We shall see! Any ramifications from this film are still being made and will show in the future.\n\nEveryone blames or believes in the highest position in America.;Only in America!
474;1471.0;5.0;5.0;"This film is very controversial, mainly because of its so called ""lies."" Though some parts of this movie are slight stretches of the truth, you can't deny the many facts that are presented to you.\n\nIf you like the President, see this movie. If you dislike the President, see this movie. It doesn't matter who you are, just watch this movie and learn something new.";Good for a few laughs, at least
620;1472.0;3.0;5.0;I first saw 9/11 in the theatre when it was released, and bought it when it came out on video.  I was very surprised to find that the section where Lila Lipscomb visited Washington and had words with a Bush supporter was not in the movie.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nDissappointing.;Why is this so different from the theatrical version?
651;1473.0;5.0;5.0;"If anyone shall diss George W. Bush, this is the way to do it.  Michael Moore, one of the finest documentary filmmakers of today, produced, directed, and wrote ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", proving the truths of the last two years.  He takes his 2002 Oscar acceptance speech (Best Documentary Feature--""Bowling For Columbine""), which had some cheering fanaticly and some booing irately, into greater depths.  Few other filmmakers have dared to explore such subject matter.  This film has been highly praised by many critics and recommended by several celebrities including Madonna and Linda Ronstadt.\n\nThis blunt, fearless filmmaker explores how this country and the military has been deceived by Bush, especially with the War In Iraq.  The featured documents, interviews, and archive film scenes help prove his point wonderfully.  Beyond that, he argues his subject matter beautifully.  The film starts with how Bush managed to slide into presidency in 2000, then shows his ""workmanship"".  Once the Twin Towers footage from 9/11 is featured, it begins growing into emotion and anger.  Moore brilliantly keeps audiences interested in every scene through his witty remarks, his interviews, and his personal reactions to every scene.  Through everything, he expresses his true compassion for this country, the people, and those highly affected by Bush's deception.\n\nThis film features various celebrities: Britney Spears, Rick Martin, Ben Affleck, Stevie Wonder, and others.  The words of the politicians and the average US citizens also add to the personal film connection.  The various arguments prove various points that this country has.  This features how some have learned the true meaning of ""anti-war"".\n\n""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a must-watch film for every citizen, especially before the upcoming election.  This proves the truths of what has happened.  Republican, democrat, independant, pro-war, or anti-war: many are sure to react emotionally to this subject matter.  This is sure to be a big wake-up call for many viewers.";A Wake-Up Call For This Country
659;1474.0;5.0;5.0;"Although I was aware in some measure of what I experienced when viewing this DVD on the day I received it from amazon.com, yet it all came into focus.  At the end of the full contents of the dvd, including features, etc., I sat back and in my mind I let it all sink in.  I must have spent an hour just digesting all that I viewed.  The opening, showing a close up of Bush, sitting there in front of the children, with his usual photo op, staged and choreographed as has been the practice of this presidency, worked in reverse and actually showed the naked truth for a change. Here was the seven minute void, showing an presidential aid whispering in his ear that the country had been attacked. The close up showing Bush's expression and demeanor,the eye movement and freeze, captured by the video was startling, the picking up of a book and the vacant stare, all that was missing was a, ""dunce cap."" Without someone pulling his strings and feeding him hidden written notes.  Here was the birth of a self proclaimed, SUPER SUPER COMMANDER-IN CHIEF."" This video clip when viewed world wide will definitely not leave a positive impression to all the terrorists lurking in the shadows.  The aforementioned was in my opinion a highlight of this dvd.  Of course all the other video clips and speeches were also of great significance.\n\nThe vido clip which described  the joint appearance of Bush and Cheney re:9/11 so called investigation by a committee held behind closed doors, not under oath, was described by Bush as he appeared before reporters, ""as a friendly conversation,"" or words to that effect, was extremely revealing.  A reporter asked if appearing jointly with Cheney was a way to keep their stories straight, Bush as is his wont, fixed a sickly grin and uttered something ridiculous.\n\nThis documentary was excellent and I would personally rate it in excess of *****.\n\nFinally, this documentary has been critized by many of the younger generation who with adoring eyes, wave banners depicting, ""we love Bush,"" and, ""four more years,"" which to me equals, ""four more arrears.""  If there were a draft, and there was a strong chance that these banner wavers would follow their Commander-in-Chief and share the agony of what is going on in Iraq, I truly believe the displays would take on another meaning.\n\nI mean to share this dvd with a few friends of different ages, just to see and learn their reaction.\n\nMy profound thanks to, ""Michael Moore,"" who made this possible.\n\nRobert Lyons, Reno, Nevada";Fahrenheit 9/11: A thought provoking experience

Watching this movie changed everything for me, and I felt privileged to have been shown the flaws in our government.  Bush is an idiot.  I cant help it, I tried to keep an open mind, I knew that Michael Moore would portray him in the worst way possible.  Still however, I found myself stunned by the things I was seeing, I couldn't believe my eyes or ears. 90% of the movie's stunning information is given by the actual people in question, so you don't have to second guess the film, there's no room for questioning.  Michael lays everything down right there in your lap and lets you feel the way you would naturally feel without trying to manipulate the viewer into thinking his way.  That's what people need to understand about this film. This is not a film for democrats, blacks, poor people or any one particular audience.  It is for the American people and America needs to wake up...stop saying things like ""im not supporting that pig while he puts my great country down""  Michael is not putting our country down in this film...our president does the job quite well enough. If you are one of these people--you are mislead--plain and simple.  I urge you to open your mind for a minute and see what is really going on, and stop letting your political preference stop you.  Most of the people that need to see this movie unfortunately will never see it and will end up voting for that moron again and let America keep washing down the drain. When you are finished watching the movie, you can watch some of the special features which are also GREAT! Especially the one with Bush after meeting with the 9/11 Commission he LIES like a dog you can read it on his face.  That needed to be in the movie in my opinion!  And Condoleeza Rice's testimony is a good laugh too.  The administration is so incompetent you won't believe it.  One thing is for sure, don't miss this opportunity because you will NEVER see anything like this on TV. And another thing I don't know ANYONE republican or democrat who has watched this film and can honestly say that they think Bush is the one for the job and we are going in the right direction.  Hey maybe Kerry isn't the one either but what do we have to lose look at the situation as it stands 4 years later. Check out this film and you will agree I guarantee it.

It is a film with an uncomprising vision - an unshakable determination to try to cut through all of the lies that the Bush administration has told to the American people and get at the truth behind the ""war on terror"" and the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Though the film does have contain much of Mr. Moore's wit and humor (him driving around in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act to baffled Washingtonians is my personal favorite) at heart it is a deeply serious film, which calls on all Americans to think about just why this war is being fought, and what it is costing the Iraqi and American people. This is a film full of warmth, compassion, and an uncomprising respect for the human rights and human dignity of ALL people.

1198;1481.0;3.0;5.0;This is a documentary which presents the view that the US-led war in Iraq is a tragic and purposeless waste of time and life, which ultimately only serves to suit the financial and political power structures within the US. I don't agree with Mr Moore's team on everything, but I agree with what he is trying to do - paint the full picture of the tragedy that is modern day Iraq (which is always difficult to get from the press). Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good and timely film. Open discussion of such complex issues itself justifies the film, despite what some ultra-conservatives might think. But at the end of the day, his lack of impartiality and blatant selectivity, including the derisive and selective theatrical style, will not, in the end, suit his ultimate cause (which is 'reality'). In the end he uses techniques and a selective style which he also accuses in those with whom he has disagreement.\n\nMy advice is, if you want a rule of thumb for these kind of political documentaries, you would do well by simply believing the truth is somewhere in the middle. Much of what Mr Moore implies is difficult to substantiate, which by any measure would mean that some of it is probably true, some isn't. People are not very good statisticians by nature (let's face it who is), therefore you often get polarised views from such documentaries - one is either very much in agreement, or very much against. A little moderation does not go astray here.\n\nYou could argue incessantly about the details, and Moore's attack on the Bush Administration might well contain strong elements of truth, however this doesn't necessarily justify blanket accusations and the blatant selectivity. Carefully placed and themed music, selectivity of example, bias justified by humour (with ridicule), camera angles (also justified by humour) and at the end of the day, the same applied to his conclusions, means truth becomes subservient to polemic, the cause, or cinematic effect. This is not really the answer to a tragedy such as modern day Iraq.\n\nNevertheless there is a lot of good stuff here that is worth mentioning. This includes that having business or family contacts doesn't necessarily translate to astute political leadership or social understanding, that the poor and the young often seem to get the raw end of the deal, that fear is often at the root of political or social strife, or that mineral and oil resources, and who owns or uses them, play a bigger part in our lives than we often think.\n\nSelectivity of example includes the following: other people than the poor and unemployed go to fight in Iraq, and the portrayal of Iraq that all was well and happy prior to the US-led invasion was grossly inadequate. What also is not mentioned is an important security issue with regards to the Iraqi style of government-regardless of WMDs- there was, (rightly or wrongly), a perceived potential of future terrorist complicity, something that was difficult if not impossible to minimise through the former regime. One of the best ways to minimise terrorist activities is through resources available to government and through international co-operation, the fact was, that Iraq was perceived (rightly or wrongly) to fail in all such respects from this perspective-regardless of the presence or non-presence of WMDs. However this doesn't necessarily justify what might be labelled, in this circumstance, a 'pre-emptive' invasion.\n\nThe level of Saudi involvement in the US is, at best, ambiguous in nature, as such trade relationships have benefits for many on both sides (not just those who own resources or trade with them). Put simply, the irony is that less business integration might create more, or different problems.\n\nOne final point-there is no such temperature as '9/11'-the title contains mixed, non-compatible concepts (ie temperature mixed with date). A small, completely irrelevant technical detail one might say, where concepts have been mixed within a title for obvious dramatic effect. But this is the difference between drama and reality. If you apply this technique to the rest of the film, Mr Moore's film becomes, at least partially, self-defeating. Small, (apparently) irrelevant truths and non-compatible concepts have been altered or mixed for dramatic effect, which is pretty much what he accuses others of doing.;Hot and cold
1372;1482.0;5.0;5.0;"If you attend the screening of this film only to watch ""Bush bashing"" you'll be disappointed.  Moore presents the facts and lets them speak for themselves.  The movie - winner of the Cannes Palme d'Or - is skillfully directed, edited and narrated.  This fact-checked documentary has a message, and it's a freighting and thought provoking one.  Interwoven through out many of the scenes lies the warning that with the wrong leadership in Washington this Republic as we know it now could perish.";Powerful - Thoughtful
1389;1483.0;4.0;5.0;"I loathed ""Bowling for Columbine"" and am not a huge fan of Michael Moore in general, so I didn't expect to like this movie very much. My expectations were lowered further when I heard a friend of mine pan it--a friend who *liked* ""Columbine"" and last year's anti-capitalist screed ""The Corporation,"" which I found horribly biased. So, I was surprised to find myself liking it, and impressed at Moore's restraint in making a film that, while biased, is probably his least biased film to date.\nNow, there are some problems with the film. Moore doesn't fully explore the implications of some of what he says, as is his wont. But there's so much footage in here that needs to be seen and which *hasn't* been in the mainstream media. We haven't been shown our dead and maimed soldiers; we haven't been shown the dead and maimed Iraqi civilians; we haven't been shown our soldiers and their families refusing to toe the party line... and these are things we must see, to understand the consequences of our government's actions.\nIf you'd rather remain ignorant of what's going on, skip this movie. But if you'd prefer to be informed, please see this movie, regardless of your politics. Take the presentation with a grain of salt, but remember, none of the footage was staged.";Impressive
1400;1484.0;4.0;5.0;The puckish Mr. Moore freely skewers President Bush as he mercilessly exposes the calculated path that led the United States to where it is today.  Although the conservative media has complained that the film is tilted and one sided, it's no more unfair than listening to an hour of G. Gordon Liddy or being exposed to Rush Limbaugh three hours a day ad infinitum.  This film also shows Moore's growth as a film maker deftly mixing the (unintentional) comedy of the current administration with the sadness of a mother who lost a son in Iraq and showing the desparation the armed forces are experiencing in their quest for additional cannon fodder.  A good diversion!;More from Moore!
1429;1485.0;4.0;5.0;"I remember (not too long ago) when Rush Limbaugh was having a field day with President Clinton's marital infidelity and the Whitewater debacle. In fact, there was nearly an impeachment over it. An impeachment! Over something that had nothing to do with American policy (foreign or otherwise).\nI'm a registered Democrat (yep, I sit on the left side pretty comfortably), but I had to eat some crow when I found out my man, Mr. President himself, had lied to the public about his affair with the young intern (and possibly others like Jennifer Flowers). I had to ""zip"" my lips shut because what he'd done was wrong. And he finally had to admit it. Shame on him. But does such an action deserve as much media attention as it got, and a near impeachment?\nNow let's zoom to the current date and Mr. Moore's film. Here we have a President who pretty much stole the White House (there is room for argument here, but when your brother is the Governor of Florida, and that was the deciding state with such a closely contested presidential run, you have to have some doubts about the validity of it.). We also have a President who's business acumen is less than impressive prior to becoming the Commander-In-Chief. And he probably didn't even know who the Heads of States were in any other country besides those in the western hemisphere (I'll let his foreign policy speak for itself here). None of this is impeachable either, but you can see where this is going. President Bush is, in my humble opinion, a moron, a puppet President. I felt this way before going in to see Fahrenheit 9/11, and felt it even stronger after watching the film.\nBut let's talk about the validity of Mr. Moore's film for a moment and not get too political (well ...as best we can anyway).\nThe Bad: Mr. Moore tries hard to make ties between the Bin Laden family and the Bush family. I think we can safely say that he didn't do this very well in the film. It's kind of like six degrees of separation, and when you're in politics those connections can be made in even less than six degrees. The thing that struck me as ""bad"" about this portion of the film was that all of these connections were made long before the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. That would be like the lead paint industry being blamed for ground water contamination since there was no way to know (at the time the paints were made) that lead was really that ""bad."" This might be an overly-simplistic example, but I didn't want to lose anyone so early on. You get the point.\nThe Good: Well, pretty much everything else. Oh sure, Michael Moore's documentary is extremely stilted toward the anti-Bush sentiment. But did that really surprise anyone? If you read newspapers or magazines at all, you HAD TO HAVE KNOWN about the controversy surrounding this film before its release in the U.S. (which almost didn't happen).\nFor some reason, President Bush reminds me of Gerald Ford. But while Ford stumbled physically (to the excitement of Chevy Chase and the Saturday Night Live gang), President Bush stumbles mentally and professionally. He can't make decisions without someone telling him what to do (if there's any doubt about this, just watch the first 1/3 of the film where he's been notified of TWO planes hitting the Twin Towers, but does nothing for many minutes while doing some PR work at a school. Not very flattering). And then, if you can handle it, watch the end of the film when he tries to remember a famous quote and, again, looks like a complete idiot (I guess no one could get to the teleprompter quick enough).\nThroughout the film the anti-Bush message is strong but if there is another message, it's that fear is even stronger. Similar to Mr. Moore's BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE documentary, this film also focuses on the fears that drive our decisions, and how the current administration fed those fears to its own advantage (the colored code alerts for the country, the new homeland security branch, and the impossible and improbable links between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein).\nIs this film for everyone? Definitely not. Is it something to be watched-with a kernel of skepticism-by those who wish to see it? Most definitely so.\nIt certainly is a film to be reckoned with in the documentary world. Although its message is so far to the ""left"" that some will ultimately throw up at its filtered messages, others will praise it for bringing light to the dark Bush administration that still remains an enigma to many.";Conservatives Turn to Eat Some Crow
1467;1486.0;5.0;5.0;michael moore has done something so many other people wouldn't have done. question the government. i had to travel 40 miles to go see this film. well worth the gas money, moore did take pot shots  bush. (which isn't too hard to do) but what got to me was near the end. with the woman who lost her son in iraq. it wasn't funny anymore.  i kept thinking about those poor kids who were lied to, and are now fighting for the bush families oil interest. everyone should go and see this movie. right or left wing, doesn't matter. it gets people talking. well done mr. moore. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!;only for the open minded..
1472;1487.0;5.0;5.0;Fahrenheit 9/11 was better than I thought it would be.  I was afraid Moore would use most of the movie to poke fun at President Bush.  He clearly does criticize and make fun of the president, but the film goes way beyond that.\nIt spells out clearly in a way everyone can understand the web of business relationships that the president's critics charge have tainted his handling of foreign policy.  It puts a face to the suffering of the families of the people killed in the invasion and occupation of Iraq.\nThe movie is completely biased against President Bush, but it still is a valid documentary.  No one going into the movie should expect it to be unbiased.\nI can sort-of understand how right wing ideologues feel appalled to see a feature length film criticizing their point of view.  After all, I can't think of a mainstream film this critical of the left.  Rightwing ideas predominate other media, though, so I don't think rightwingers should be indignant about one movie showing the progressive point of view.\nThis movie is a great rallying point for people who already disagree with the president.  It is not scholarly nor does it try to be.\nProgressives will get good laughs and some tears out of this movie.  Rightwingers will probably find the movie silly, and hopefully they will get a glimpse at how silly FOX News and other rightwing media seem to people who don't share their ideology.;It was as good as or better than Bowling for Columbine
1477;1488.0;5.0;5.0;"This is truly one of the most emotional and moving documentary which I have to admit, I have ever seen. Michael Moore is truly someone who exemplifies a human conscience, to take a firm stance against the hypocrisy of the ""right-wing corporate"" media that is owned today by so many cable news networks,such as Fox News and high war-profiteering industrialists, e.g. Halliburton, which till this day continue to exploit so many ordinary working class citizens, towards an endless war for the sole purpose of capital interest, power, greed, and oil..";Conscience still exists...!
1478;1489.0;4.0;5.0;"First off, I want to point out to the reviewer that talked about Michael Moore eating McDonald's three meals a day, you're getting your movies mixed up. What you're thinking of is Super Size Me (and Michael Moore didn't even direct that movie). But that also makes me wonder if that person even saw this movie. But this goes out to some of the 5-star reviewers, too; a lot of the reviewers say that this movie looks like it's going to be good. Come on, people; can't we SEE the movie first and THEN review it?\nAnyway, Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very interesting movie. Michael Moore's dismay against President Bush is still evident here, and basically he talks about the events leading up to, and resulting from, Bush's inauguration and the World Trade Center attacks, as well as the unnecessary war with Iraq. And whether or not you agree with Michael's statements is relative, but at least he backs up his claims. Throughout the movie you'll find video clips and files of goings-on; also, you'll see what Bush was doing during these tough times and what he SHOULD'VE been doing (at least, according to Michael).\nI knocked off half a star because in the last half-hour of the movie, things started to drag. But this is still a very good movie. If you really, REALLY love George W. Bush though, you'll probably won't like this, but everyone else should see it.\nAnthony Rupert";4-1/2 stars -- Controversy sells!
1482;1490.0;5.0;5.0;No matter what your opinion on politics, Michael Moore or the war in Iraq, you must see this film.  Unlike other documentaries by Moore, he is rarely seen in the film.  Also despite what some people have said, this is not purely an attack on Bush, nor is it anywhere close to an endorsement of the Democrats.  The documentary pieces together information, both from our nightly news sources and from info and interviews that were never broadcast for the public before, and puts together an argument for why we are probably actually at war.  Luckily there is a bit of humor (at the expense of Bush, Ashcroft and the like) to break up what is otherwise a truly unsettling, rage-inducing, heart-breaking depiction of the contrast between what we thought we knew and what may be closer to the truth. Please watch the movie.  Protect and work to restore our freedoms and those of others around the world.;you must see this
1484;1491.0;5.0;5.0;"This is a profoundly disturbing film.  It is a very human film -- more human than previous Moore films -- which is evident from the start, when we see the events of 9/11 in New York not via the oft-seen picture of the planes crashing into the towers, but via the expressions of the people on the ground.  The emphasis on people continues throughout, as we see documentary footage on the ground in Iraq, the reactions of a gung-ho military mom who learns of her son's death, the juxtaposition of injured Iraqi children with news briefings on the ""intelligence"" of the targeting missiles, and scenes of amputated veterans whose benefits Bush seeks to decrease while the military continues to aggressively recruit soldiers from those who have no way out of the poorest areas of the country.  In a cinematically engaging manner, and with strenuously documented information, the film cannot help but portray the morally insupportable stance of a war which is provoked by greed and sustained by misinformation and fear-mongering.  The only thing that might be more disturbing than the film itself is the choice of some viewers to suppress any human response to it.";Disturbing

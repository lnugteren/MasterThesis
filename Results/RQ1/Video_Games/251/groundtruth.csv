235;1.0;1.0;1133.0;Do not buy this game. It is a total waste of your hard earned money. Just read some of the reviews and you will see this is nothing more than a gimped console port. Everything that makes this game a PC game is missing.\n\nI would recommend waiting for Battlefield Bad Company 2 for the PC instead. It retains much of what is still desirable in a PC game.\n\nHere is a break down of the differences between Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

246;2.0;1.0;1016.0;"The perks of buying the PC version according to Infinity Ward (IW):\n\n1. Text chatting. Now you can text chat to your buddies in-game while online, what fantastic innovation.\n\n2. Adjustable graphics setting -- gotta give them points for adding that feature, while console users are stuck with their 720/1080 resolution, you can max it up all the way depending on your hardware. Amazing stuff...although every game has had this feature since the beginning of PC gaming.\n\n3. The ability to use your mouse and keyboard. Now you can unplug your xbox controller and use your computer accessories for a more accurate FPS experience(!).\n\n4. You'll have a fantastic smooth time connecting to IWNet; its so perfect, it'll even give you XBox Live error messages.\n\nNow, the negatives:\n\n1. You're paying more for an inferior product. $60 vs $50. The consoles have a valid excuse for charging more -- $10.00 goes to the console manufacturer (Sony or Microsoft), Activision is just being greedy here; really quite unacceptable, especially in today's economy.\n\n2. Dedicated servers removed -- don't even get me started; I'm sure you've heard of the petition which is nearing 200,000 signatures to re-include dedicated servers. We're left with a terrible online experience. I played the first Modern Warfare (MW) on the PS3 which had peer to peer online play and it was disastrous. Expect drop outs and poor performance. The host of the game will always have the advantage because they have the better latency.\n\n3. No mods. This is surprising because so many other popular games were developed from mods including -- Counterstrike, Team-fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead. The only reason I can think of why IW/Activision would want to do such a thing would be to charge for content later on. I remember paying for 3 maps for the first MW -- and to tell you the truth, it really wasn't worth it.\n\n4. Steam required. When you install the game you are required to install the Steam platform and link it to an e-mail address, and your Steam username. This makes reselling the game next to impossible.\n\n5. Feels and plays more like a Modern Warfare 1.5 then a Modern Warfare 2.0; the graphics are alright for todays standard, but I was expecting a lot more from IW for a two year development cycle.\n\n6. Short single player. Since they've gimped the multiplayer aspect, and the single player can roughly be finished in 6-7 hours, I suggest you rent this on the console if you have one.\n\n7. Multiplayer only allows 9 vs 9 (18 player) matches. MW1 allows up to 64 -- does more mean more enjoyable? No, not necessarily, but at least there is choice and server admins were able to set it to their liking.\n\nInfinity Ward have really let their fans down. The multi-player made the original spectacular; with the removal of dedicated servers, competitive and fair play is dead.\n\nBusiness schools should take note because this would make a wonderful case study on how a company has ruined one of the most anticipated  franchise in such a short amount of time. MW2 was literally a license to print money for Activison/IW. With such a terrible management decision, reinstating dedicated servers will be the only hope to redeem themselves in the eyes of their consumers -- however I think this fiasco will not be easily forgotten.\n\n*** Update 11/18/09\n\nTheres hope yet! Hackers have released a patch so you can start/join a dedicated server; its disgusting that this has to come from the underground scene and not Activision/IW. It seems that the hacked copies ""freely"" available over the Internet is now the superior version.\n\nHackers have also found hidden modes via the console -- Global Thermonuclear War, One Flag CTF and VIP mode -- future downloadable content already in the game? How low you've fallen Activision/IW.\n\n*** Update 04/16/10\n\nI've given up on this game and probably this series for good -- The 'impenetrable' IWNet is plagued with hacks and cheats.  I suggest you all save your money and get Battlefield Bad Company 2 instead;  I've been enjoying the experience so far, its a game that involves more strategy and not your standard Modern Warfare, run and gun. Even the NY Times agrees that Bad Company 2 is a better game than Modern Warfare 2. [...]";Disappointing
217;3.0;1.0;536.0;"I actually bought this game even though it will be the last Infinity Ward game I support by purchasing. I've been a huge fan of said developer since Call of Duty 1, a PC exclusive, since day one. I've purchased every single Call of  Duty game developed by Infinity Ward over the years (including the expansion for CoD1 which wasn't developed by them). I never had a problem purchasing their products. Until now. This is the first time I've ever felt like a total tool and a moron for purchasing their ""PC game"".\n\nThe game IS phenomenal. The graphics are noticeably improved over Modern Warfare 1, despite using the same graphics engine.  The overhaul is there, but a lot of current gen games have better visuals.  Sound design is great as always. There's a lot of recycled sounds and some new ones. Multiplayer is more of the same which isn't a bad thing, and the new co-op mode, from what I've played so far, seems fun. That's where my positive review ends. So basically you get more of the same, with slightly upgraded graphics.\n\nHere's where things turn bad.  For starters, Activision is charging $60 for this game, a move that completely goes against the grain of PC game pricing trends. Why? Because they can.  It's a business move, yes, but it's completely immoral and greedy. Corporate greed rears its ugly head.  Activision are the new EA.  You would think for $10 you would get, oh I don't know, a longer than average single player campaign right?  Well you don't.  If you thought Modern Warfare's campaign was short prepare to get slapped in the face with a campaign that can easily be completed in one session.  Bigger price, smaller experience.\n\nBut most people are probably buying it for multiplayer anyway, so let's discuss that. Basically it's all been said before. This is a console port, right down to being limited to 9v9.  Want to get your clan together for some 32 vs. 32?  Nope.  16 vs 16?  Nope.  Oh come on then....at least give me some 12 v 12.  Sorry Charlie.  You get 9v9, just like the console. And just like the console you can't sort servers and pick where you want to play, you can't tweak game parameters via a developer console (another PC industry standard that Infinity Ward think's it's too good to implement), and, OH, no dedicated server support.\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised the PC port even allowed me to play with a mouse and keyboard....\n\nIt's painfully obvious that Infinity Ward prefer console development at this point (particularly the 360, which gets exclusive content before anybody else for the second game in row now), and it's even clearer that Activsion are greedy jerks.\n\nIt was a good run, Infinity Ward, but just like real life I won't associate with conceited, big-headed people. You won't get any more of my money.  MW2 gets one star for actually being a fun game, but insulting PC gamers by lying about features that never made it to the game (dedicated servers, more people per server than the console versions, etc), and the fact that your publisher is price gouging, keeps it from scoring higher.\n\n** APPENDED MULTIPLAYER INFO **\n\nOkay so I've put in a few hours of multiplayer over the last few days and my worst fears were confirmed consistently.  Horrible latency just ruins the experience.  The game measures latency by a 4 bar system, similar to a mobile phone's signal strength.  So rather than seeing what your latency is as measured by miliseconds, you will see 1-4 bars.  Usually 3. Very rarely in my time playing MP did I ever have 4 bars, unless I was hosting the game.  I kept a close eye on other player's latencys(using the TAB button) and probably 70% of the players had 3 bars as well, with usually just 1 or 2 people having 4 bars - one of which was the player hosting the game - and a couple unfortunate fools who were somehow getting by with 2 bars or less. The person who hosts a game enjoys a SIGNIFICANT advantage over even those with 3 bars. The killcam proves it. Time after time after time I would get killed and, through the eyes of my opponent thanks to killcam, notice that there was about a half second difference between what I saw and what actually happened. Then I'd hit the TAB button and sure enough, that guy has 4 bars and I only have 3. Ridiculous. I have a fast enough internet connection (2 MB up), and don't notice these latency disadvantages with other shooters, so I have to put the blame solely on IWNET.\n\nIt's really unfortunate and it's just the way it is which is sad as the multiplayer seems really fun and the levels are well thought out. The reality is if you want to play Multiplayer you're going to have to put up with a LOT of frustrating deaths, even if you get the drop on somebody, because he is enjoying a significant latency advantage.\n\nThe matchmaking is also broken.  It's supposed to match you based on latency (therefore location) and skill, so why was I constantly in matches with people with 1-2 bars of latency, versus lieutenants and generals when I was only a lowly specialist?\n\nBottom line is if you have either console and a PC, just get the console version because that's all you're getting on the PC. The PC version has no right disgracing the other games on your hard drive by pretending to be a PC game itself.  This game fails utterly. I would rate it half a star if I could.";Fun game, but shame on Activision and Infinity Ward
208;4.0;1.0;253.0;"When Call of Duty arrived on the PC scene, we were given an intense World War 2 first person shooter that blew away all other similar shooters at that time. For once, Medal of Honor had been matched and beaten at its own game. The sequel to Call of Duty, United Offensive, brought one of the best multiplayer World War 2 experiences ever seen in a game to the PC platform. Both titles were only\non PC, I would like to emphasize.\n\nThen came Call of Duty 2 and the Xbox 360. Since that point in time, Call of Duty on PC has never been the same. We were handed a game that looked better than the original but was lacking in multiplayer content and had minimally improved single-player. By the time the developers had stuck a ""3"" to the end of the title, the PC platform was nowhere to be found. Completely abandoned. Left to dry.\n\nBut PC gamers were thrown a couple bones with the releases of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and the most recent PC Call of Duty game, World at War. Finally, we had the games back on our platform. They weren't the best in the world, but they were solid experiences all around. Again, the single player had dimwitted respawning A.I. foes and did little to give us an innovative experience, but the multiplayer in each games provided solid, replay-value-packed shooting that could hardly be looked down upon.\n\nAnd now, here we are again, going through rough times. She and I just aren't making ends meet anymore, if you know what I mean. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a complete disgrace to the PC platform. Yes, unlike several years ago in the case of Call of Duty 3, we actually have a Call of Duty game on our platform and for that we perhaps should be grateful; but even with that being said, it's difficult to cope with what exactly is happening here. There are so many negative points surrounding Modern Warfare 2, I would probably be sprouting grey hairs on my head by the time I was finished pointing out each of them. Instead, I'll get straight to the points. And there are many of them, so bare with me.\n\nWhat should normally be a $50 game at launch is now $60. Suddenly, we're being charged as much as the console kids for this game. What should normally be a PC-optimized port with support for dedicated servers, mods to change player limits and gameplay experiences, and more, is instead one in which we have no dedicated servers, no modification tools, no ability to extend the maximum amount of players in a server, no ability to record demos for the sake of footage and server moderation and administration, and even no unique PC features other than mouse control, text chat, and the ability to change graphical options. Yes, most of which were present in Wolfenstein 3D in 1992. And now, the icing on the cake: When we're not struggling to play the online portion of the game while leeching off another bum's connection, we can instead feast on a handful-of-hours, rinse-&-repeat single-player experience that features little to no replay value due to its linear, scripted gameplay.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the last straw for us PC gamers. We deserve more, because Call of Duty originated on our platform and if not for us, Modern Warfare 2 would not exist today. The heart and soul of Call of Duty should still remain embedded in PCs all over the world, but instead Infinity Ward has taken the path of ignorance and downright disrespect towards those who helped make their franchise possible. For these deeds, they can shove their money being horded from console gamers where the sun doesn't shine.\n\nI want a divorce.";I want a divorce.
1;5.0;3.0;5.0;"I'm a fairly intrepid gamer, but I don't play multi-player games (hard for a 66 year old to compete with the reflexes of a bunch of teenagers :-) ),so cannot comment on it for this game.  I prefer the solo experience....with no-one watching. LOL\n\nI also wait until games I want fall in price to under $40, so I am usually 2-3 years behind.  I'm far from cheap but I don't believe ANY game is worth more than that.\n\nI have now completed all 4 levels, including veteran, and some of the Special Ops addition (included).  Took me about 4 days.  Was well worth $20 for the entertainment.  The stats say I played it 1 day, 18 hours, 28 mins, so 42 1/2 hours total.\n\nPros: Vivid & stunning graphics.  Smooth play.  Nice surprises.  Great detail in weapons....too many choices, really. Fun vehicles...snowmobile, zodiac...I wish there was more.  Story line a bit over the top, but good.  Replayability has some promise, but no where near as good as COH as far as that is concerned.  Creative ending credits are cool. I'd give it 4 stars if it had a save game function.\n\nCons:  Storyline: How the hell did Ivan become the main man of Russia?  I thought I killed him and blew up all his facilities up in ModernWarfare 1!!\nNo Save Game ability...as usual.  This really pisses me off.  I do not like to be dependant on some programmers view of when a game should be saved.  Sometimes they really get it wrong.  This game does a pretty good job, but there were times when it was just very wrong IMO.\nIt's dependant on STEAM...what can I say.  Thanks you asshat hackers for making that atrocious necessity exiist,  although I suspect they'd do it anyway to encourage the ""social"" gaming aspect.  I hate it because I'm a solo player and should not have to tolerate it in order to play a game...alone.\nFinally, there's no way to skip the rather long opening credits of the ""top dogs"".  This is poor judgement on Activision/Infinity Ward's part and a transparent ego trip.  To be forced to endure that crap each time you start a new game is plain stupid, especially since they re-run the full credits at the end.";Good Solo
228;6.0;1.0;158.0;I beat the game already. Its pretty disappointing to have paid 60 dollars for 6 hours of fun. As there is a crappy multiplayer system for this game, there is 0 replay value. You'll get better bang for your buck by going to the movie theater 5 times instead of playing this overpriced game.\n\nInfinity Ward, you can do better. Your multiplayer system is a joke. Lack of Modding capabilities is a step back. Blatant contempt for a fan base is pretty lame as well. I never thought that I would dislike a company more than EA, but congrats, you've done it.;Disappointing
223;7.0;1.0;127.0;No 32 man servers?  Who is going to host?  WTF warring on MW2 will not happen.  Quick survey of 120+ COD clans, ZERO - EXACTLY ZERO clans plan on creating a MW2 faction.  Heck most of these have LFD factions for goodness sake.\n\nNo multiplayer = fail.;NO DEDICATED SERVER = FAIL
219;8.0;1.0;114.0;I am a huge fan of the original Modern Warfare. I purchased it for Windows and then for the Mac when it was released. I've been playing the Multiplayer for several years now and I've even gotten several of my friends to purchase a copy so we could play online. I was excited to see the new MW2 and preordered. I should have waited. The multiplayer is a complete disappointment. No dedicated servers, no control at all for the user base. If you liked the original MW multiplayer experience, do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.;disappointment
218;9.0;1.0;107.0;The reason console games cost a little more is because of the expensive, proprietary manufacturing process (Sony, Nintendo) and license fees (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo).\n\nThere are no proprietary technologies associated with manufacturing a PC game.  There are no license fees to the platform.\n\nThis was an attempt by a greedy company to capitalize on the success of COD4 and the hype of MW2's release by charging above-market costs.  The problem with hype is that you have to live up to it, which this game clearly does not.\n\nAdditionally, it looks like they made a lot of people mad with the lack of dedicated servers.  People play this game on home networks with asymmetric internet access:  your upload is much slower than your download.  This means that to host a game without a dedicated server, someone has to use their slow upload bandwidth.  Again, this looks to me like an attempt to control cost by not having to pay for and maintain dedicated servers and bandwidth without regard for performance.\n\nSuch a greedy move should be met with no less than abject failure.\n\nSo, I'll wait until I see this on the 5 dollar rack, which should be by about next week sometime based on everyone's feedback.\n\nActivision:  If you read this, please learn from your mistake, and understand that you can't charge extra money for hype nor lame.;Let this be a lesson in hubris
60;10.0;4.0;102.0;"First and foremost.. Yes, I've played my share of both multiplayer and singleplayer. I've also been cal and cevo main, I've played games like cs (1.6, css) and cod4 among others semi-professionally. Also my review may contain spoilers. Just keep that in mind - Thanks.\n\nSo I'll start with the singleplayer. All I have to say is, wow. It's like a very entertaining and very good interactive movie. The action is very fast, very brutal. I had no problems playing the campaign, except at the end. The game did crash once on the very last level however, but I didn't have any problems afterwards. My first time through playing it, on veteran, I beat it in roughly 6 hours. So it's short but what a ride. Speaking about rides... There's a lot of them! You ride on snowmobiles, helicopters, jeeps, cars, trucks, boats, and even a little underwater transport (Think James Bond in Thunderball).\n\nThis game is VERY violent, which should be obvious. But I was actually quite a bit surprised with how dark this is. Several times I came up behind someone (Above and even below sometimes as well!) and had to use my knife in a pre-set action sequence that showed me pulling the guy in and then either holding my hand over his mouth and stabbing him, or pulling him in and slitting his throat. It could definitely be upsetting for some people, keep that in mind. Heck, one mission involves you disguising yourself as a Russian to get close to the enemy where you take park in a absolute massacre at an airport. You, with several other Russians, go into an airport and start shooting innocent civilians. For those who might be offended, bothered or anything else by it you can skip the level but this should give you an idea of how much darker this game is.\n\nThat being said, this had some interesting plot twists and drama to it. Fighting in Suburbs in the states against Russians was quite a powerful few missions that left me with chills. There's a lot of death in this game, not just people around you but let's just say you go through quite a few characters and it's sad to see the things that happen to them.\n\nThe voice acting is absolutely superb. It's not over the top, or too corny. The military ""lingo"" if you will is very well done unlike most games that try to play in a military type setting. The music is also great, I didn't find it annoying or too over the top like in some games and it helped create a great atmosphere. My only gripe was some of the sounds with the guns, I love guns personally and most of the guns here didn't really sit well with me. Some of them sounded great but some rifles just made me wanna mute the sound.\n\nThis game looks great as well, it's not quite as good as Crysis, but maybe the next call of duty, or the one after that will get there... But it's still a very beautiful game nonetheless. The gameplay is solid, and it's much better this time around opposed to the first modern warfare. You don't have (Or at least, it's not as noticeable) the same ""Infinite respawn"" problem that the first game had which was such a good thing. The game always tells you where you need to be going and the maps are laid out that way so you're never lost.\n\nAll in all, the singleplayer game was a great, if not dark, experience. If you can handle the violence it's definitely worth the play.\n\nNow, onto multiplayer.\n\nSo, this is where most of the PC gamers flip out about.\n\nSo let me try to explain most of this.\n\nOk, first of all there is absolutely no dedicated servers. It's all match-making. Which is great for consoles. But not for PC's. For example, I've played several games where the host had problems and either the game would completely drop, or the game would try to find another acceptable host in the game. Causing for what seems like a break in the game that lasts FOREVER. There's no servers you can pick from, so you can't pick to play on a server with the lowest ping, to make sure that you're getting as lag free of a game as possible. You have to rely on whoevers hosting it and MANY times (At least in my experience) the game would get horribly laggy several times per map.\n\nThat may not seem like a big deal but believe me, after it happens a few times I can definitely see how it would piss some people off. I'm extremely laid back and it was starting to bug me, so then you know something's wrong.\n\nAlso a big thing with PC games is having a server to play. Usually most people who pub will pick a server and if they have friends who play there or just have a nice time there will keep going back to that same server. It's like, why would you pick your favorite starbucks shop over the next one? Maybe it's the people? Or just the little things. You have this sort of community in the server but now you can't have that. So I can understand why people would have a problem with that as well.\n\nThere's also no console in the PC version, which is annoying. Because I like to record some demos and maybe make a video (Not of pubs of course), a lot of people make gaming/frag videos, it's just a fun little thing to do and to show off. But you can't do that here. You can't also see your fps, ms, or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking about not having console commands or dedicated servers... Scrimming or any sort of league play is going to be quite a challenge. I honestly can't see how it will work, as far as I'm concerned there simply WONT be any competitive play with Modern Warfare 2.\n\nHowever, the multiplayer is fun. The new perks, weapons, and awards and things you can unlock are great. As you progress through ranks you can unlock emblems and titles that display on your name. It might be a cool or cute little icon or whatever. There's A LOT to unlock. Perks you unlock (Things that give you like faster reloads, more damage, longer running, etc) can also be upgraded.\n\nYou can customize your kill/death streaks as well which is really cool. So instead of just having the same 3 that everyone had in the first game, some guy might have his first perk at 10 kills and it might be an attack helicopter, at 25 kills, it'd be a tactical nuke. It's just really fun. You can also play as support from an aircraft overhead and rain down an incredible amount of ordnance on the playing field.\n\nThere's no more leaning in this game, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you look at it but I've found myself more often that not at a corner wishing I could just lean a little so I can get a peak and take some shots.\n\nBut all that said, this really does feel like a very cheap port. Don't get me wrong, I know they still put some time and effort into this but so much is missing it makes you have to sit back and scratch your head.\n\nOn one hand, you have a great, engaging and powerful single player mode but on the other is a fun, yet broken multiplayer that's lacking so much it almost feels like you're being chained down.\n\nIt'd be like if you lived in some small town in the middle of nowhere and there's 1 car dealership and you HAVE to get a car. But when you get there, the dealer will only sell you this one car, missing a lot of the basic things that you almost need in a car these days (Can we say, no power steering? LOL) and you just feel like you're just getting screwed and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nOk maybe that was a bad example but you get the idea I hope. I'm not pissed off like most people, but I am a little sad.\n\nEDIT: I also forgot to note that the matchmaking itself, is pretty awful. I don't know what it's doing but it never picks a good server, and depending on the time of day you're playing you can easily not find a single game to join. So you have to go through the menus to pick which game type you want to play (I also forgot to mention that) and then wait for the game to pick a server for you once again. Which can seriously take forever, sometimes I never even found a game but if I could see servers, I could just pick one from a list. In 10 seconds I could find a server I liked and be joining it but here I'm waiting, 5, 10 minutes. Nothing. But once again, it all just depends. It seems to average out a lot of things and I just end up with a really mediocre (At best - In regards to server quality, etc) game.\n\nEdit 11/15/09: A few things I forgot to mention... First of all, you can't change the audio. There's just a master volume you can turn up or down, so you can't turn down the sound for music, or anything like that separately. The music in multiplayer can get extremely annoying, like if the game is about to end, it plays some music but it's so loud and overbearing that you can barely hear anything going on in the game so if you're trying to hear someone, sorry, not gonna work. There's also a lot of things missing in mp like for instance, if you join a game, and you're in a lobby.. You can't type to anyone. The only way you can talk to someone when you're in the lobby is by using a mic, if you don't have a mic, too bad. Also unless you're the one hosting the game, no one can kick (or vote kick) someone off which is VERY annoying. Leveling up is much slower compared to the first modern warfare.\n\nI haven't found a way to host a game. You're only allowed to join a server and matchmaking picks someone to host when everyone joins the lobby but often times the host it picks, are pretty awful. Either they drop from the game, and the game has to pick another host which I've encountered the changing of hosts dozens of times and it's extremely annoying. Or they just don't know what to do so if someone SHOULD be kicked, they don't do anything about it.\n\nI also realized I forgot to mention about spec-ops in singleplayer, it's ok. It's nothing great, nazi zombies from world at war was way more fun and had a LOT more replay value. There's some fun missions, but overall it's just not that great. Once you beat it, there's little reason to go back and even playing on veteran most of them aren't difficult because they're extremely short.\n\nI also haven't found a single map in mw2 that I really like (In multiplayer) some are just ""ok"" but I definitely don't have one that I WANT to play and this isn't just me, I've heard this from just about everyone who plays it. The maps aren't that good and it really puts a kink in playing mp.";Could've been better, but it's not *THAT* bad.
239;11.0;1.0;98.0;What if I play single player campaign and could care less about multiplayer vs mode?  Is it really worth $60 for 5 hours of play? Are you people out of your minds?\n\nAnd from what I hear regarding the multi-player it has a lot of drawbacks as well....\n- No customization or developer console\n- No dedicated servers.\n- Limited number of players.\n- Only plays in IW servers that are laggy\n\nBiggest problem of them all is ignoring customer wants/needs, more then that disrespecting them....;$60 is asking too much for 5hours of play
207;12.0;2.0;65.0;I've gotta echo many of the reviews here.  Infinity Ward really dropped the ball here.  I only wish I had come on here earlier today before I dropped $60 on this package.  When there's a big hype for a game, you sort of expect the game not to live up to expectations, but this time around, it was almost as if the the developers purposed to fall far short.\n\nSingle player is pretty nice.  The graphics and soundtrack are really top-of-the-line.\n\nBut 98% of the game time people look for in Call of Duty is the multi-player.  The multiplayer game itself is just as stellar as past iterations of the series.  IW again set the bar high on this.  To summarize some of the changes, each class now has several new options.  First is your primary weapon, as per usual.  Second is your secondary weapon.  This can be machine pistols of various sorts, handguns, shotguns, or launchers.  I love this change, as it rearranges some of the old choices into means that make more sense.  (Primary among these is that I no longer have to choose shotgun as my primary weapon!)\n\nNow also, instead of grenades, you can opt for other equipment, such as throwing knives.  An interesting twist, though I'm not sure how much I'll use these other options.  One upside that I've noticed so far, however, is there are far few random grenades being bandied about.\n\nFinally, there's the new perk system, which is a great improvement over the old system, as good as it was.  There are new perks, tweaks to old perks, and some of the old perks are removed.  In addition, the perk categories have all been rearranged in a more balanced manner.  For example, 'Sleight of Hand' is now a blue perk, instead of a red one.\n\nAdditionally, there is the 'death streak' perk.  The old overpowered perks (e.g., martyr) have been moved to this category.  These perks are activated if you hit a certain death streak, in order to give you a slight advantage and get you a kill or two.  So if Last Stand is your death streak perk, if you die four times in a row without getting a kill, the perk will be active for you until you get a kill.  This nicely keeps some of those perks around, while keeping the game balanced, fun, and un-annoying.\n\nFinally, you get to choose your own kill streak bonuses.  Rather than the default UAV, Airstrike, Helo of COD4, there are a dozen or so bonuses that you can unlock and activate.  If you don't like UAV, you can replace it with another similarly powered bonus, such as the new radar jammer.  And the new kill streak bonuses are really fun to play with.  Most are more interactive than the fire-and-forget bonuses of COD4.\n\nNow the bad news...\n\nInfinity Ward has completely stripped the multiplayer game of the usual client/server paradigm.  Basically, what this means is you pick the game mode you want to play (e.g., Team Deathmatch) and you'll be automatched into a room with up to 18 players.  Two obvious downsides to this: you don't get to pick which room you join, nor will you ever play more populated games, like 16-on-16 or larger.  Clans are all but dead now.  And you can forget about having a 'regular' server where can always join up with familiar players.  Additionally, even the most minor tweaks that you could make on dedicated servers (e.g., disabling unpopular maps or hosting a single map 24/7) are not available.\n\nYes, I should mention that you can form up a team before the automatch, to ensure that you and your friends are in the same room, but this is no substitute.  For one, it requires a great deal more effort to invite all your friends to the same team each time.  But it also requires being actual 'friends' with someone, such that they would accept an invitation.  My experience with online play of the COD series, was that I would have a large number of players who I would know, who would know me, who I'd see from time to time on certain servers, and who I know I'd always get a good game with.  But this new game has been completely divested of this community feel.\n\nThe fact that these things have changed are enough to turn me off.  But they have widespread effects on the multiplayer experience, as well.  Because of the mandatory smaller room sizes, the game becomes more of a game of cat and mouse, where the person who can sneak around off the radar and knife people becomes the dominant player.  Sorry, but that's not why I play COD.  Because there's not a critical mass of players on the map, it's nearly impossible to monitor all the approaches and flanks.  And gone are the days when there was a definite 'front line', so that you didn't have to check your rear every 2 seconds.\n\nI never considered myself someone who valued dedicated servers.  For example, I was never one who played mods all that much, if ever.  But having actually played the new matching system, I must say, I greatly prefer the client/server system.  I understand what the 'whining' is all about, even if I disagree with the whining itself.\n\nAll in all, the multiplayer aspect has great potential.  I love all of the changes they've made to the multiplayer game: the new class customizations are really an improvement upon previous iterations.  But until Infinity Ward fixes these problematic aspects of the PC online multi-player experience, I'll probably go back to playing other FPS games.  I just don't find 9-on-9 games all that exciting.  It's too bad that I paid $60 for this...;Where are my dedicated servers?

237;14.0;1.0;56.0;The sequel to the very sucessful Modern Warfare sadly lacks many of the features that made the first game great on the PC platform. Such features include:\n\n- No dedicated server support: In Modern Warfare 2, all games will be hosted by players on a peer-to-peer system. This severely affects multiplayer balance, as the host will always have the advantage of having zero latency, while other players will suffer from increased latency when compared to a dedicated server, since the latter gives you the option of selecting a server close to you.\n\n- Maximum of 18 players per match: This is a consequence of the above. Since games will be hosted by players, you are limited to how much upload bandwidth a home connection can provide. The first Modern Warfare could support up to 64 players per match.\n\n- No console commands: You won't be able to change the game's settings to match your gaming setup, such as changing the Field of View (FOV) from 65, the default value for Xbox 360 games, to something better suited for PC gaming.\n\nI see no reason to justify the inflated $60 price tag for a game that is in many aspects inferior to it's predecessor. It's clear that Activision has decided to create a quick, cheap port of the Xbox 360 game instead of taking their time to deliver an experience that matches the (reasonable) expectations of the platform.\n\nI would not recommend anyone to buy this game for the PC. There are other developers that still focus on providing good gameplay on the PC, and those should be supported. Instead, if you must, buy this game for the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, as you'll be getting the same experience, and very likely, much better support for the game.;Lacks many features from it's predecessor.

If you friend or family member wants to borrow the game, they will need your login credentials.\n\n- Lack of standalone patches. This is a major incovenience as Steam will try to install the latest patch version even if it's problematic or broken. It is also impossible to backup these patches, requiring you to download them each time.\n\nThis game is a complete failure than any self respecting PC gamer should avoid.";DRM

Everything is greatly tweaked, everything looks nice, and the co-op is top notch. But if you plan on making a 5* product on the PC, IW, you can't cut features and then raise the price. There's absolutely no excuse for reason for charging $60 for this game. That's a -1*. Greed should never be rewarded. Then there's the lack of dedicated servers. P2P isn't the worst thing ever, but it's not good. It really is only as good as the host. That's another star removed. Then we took out mods. And the reason this was taken out is because now PC gamers have the ""privledge"" of spending $10 for 3-4 maps when they need some more cash. In other words, mods were taken out to solely make money. Greed. -2* for the greed and the removal of mods. That leaves us with 1*. That's about all this game is. A 1* title on the PC. Console, easily a 5*.

250;27.0;1.0;39.0;"Betrayal. That's the single word that best summarizes this sham of a release by Activision and Infinity Ward.\n\nThey have betrayed everyone possible at every step they could. They betrayed their own PC roots by not including dedicated server support, a staple feature of practically every multiplayer first person shooter in the past 10 years. With the removal of dedicated servers also goes custom map support, mod support, and competitive (clan) gaming support, again, all staples of practically every multiplayer first person shooter in the past 10 years. They further betrayed all PC gamers by raising the price by $10, with absolutely nothing to make up for it.\n\nI would claim that they even betrayed Steam, the very platform they base the game's activation server and anti-cheat server, by not allowing digital download copies of the game to be activated on release day. This will no doubt cause a flurry of cancellations from Steam as impatient gamers go out to buy the boxed copy instead.\n\nIt's also ironic that they betrayed the very reason that they gave for dropping dedicated server support: simplicity for casual players. Instead of browsing a list of available servers, many players are now told that they must change their NAT settings from ""strict"" to ""open"". If you don't know what I just said, don't worry, I'm sure most people have no idea what a NAT even is.\n\nI can give many other examples of such betrayals, but I'll leave it with this: I believe that Activision has betrayed the entire gaming industry. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said that one of his goals was (and I quote) ""to take all the fun out of making video games."" Supporting this game would in fact be supporting the very antithesis of what gaming is all about.";Betrayal

Purchasing the game is nothing less than a declaration of you willingness to loss those benefits, and you're communicating that fact not just to IW, but to all of the publishers who are watching closely to see just how much they can get away with offering gamers a lesser exchange for their money.  And don't pretend for a moment that this is just about PC gaming.  The trend in all of gaming is away from game ownership and towards gaming as a rented service.\n\nThe publishers' utopian wetdream is a market where the gamer owns nothing.  They pay explicitly for every hour of gameplay they experience, and even then are only allowed to play within the strict and permanent boundaries erected by the publisher.  And when the publisher decides you should stop playing an old game because it is no longer profitable enough, they terminate it and offer you the 'choice' of buying a new game, or to not play at all.\n\nI've read a lot of commentary that is dismissive if not outright disparaging of the passionate furor exhibited by a select few over the MW2 issue, saying things like, ""what's the problem, just let the market decide.""  Yes, absolutely, the market should decide, but don't ""let"" it happen.  Realize that you, as a game-purchasing consumer, *ARE* the market.  The market is nothing but the cumulative purchasing choices of all consumers.  The only power you have as a consumer is to accept or reject the exchange offered by publishers.  If you choose to purchase MW2, you are personally endorsing the continued erosion of value that gamers receive in their exchange with publishers.\n\nA lot of people think that they can complain about issues like this, but then buy the product anyway, and somehow that influences publishers to react to their complaints.  The only thing that influences them is WHETHER OR NOT YOU BUY THE GAME!  Bitching about something and buying the game is equivalent to buying the game and saying nothing -- it's equivalent even to buying the game and saying ""Great job guys, keep up the good work and be sure to strip away more of my consumer benefits next time.""  Because the only thing they hear is the sound of you purchasing the game - registering yet another gamer tacitly accepting reduced benefits, lowering the standard by which all publishers measure the market for all games.\n\nThere are more games than I could play in a lifetime, and no single one of them is great enough that it's worth trading away the freedoms that I want to enjoy as a gamer.  The only way I can compel publishers to respect and uphold those freedoms is by using my own incremental market vote to communicate the value of those freedoms, and to hope that others do the same in sufficient volume to convince publishers in no uncertain terms that it's more profitable to provide them than it is to take them away.";Nothing less than the continued erosion of consumer freedoms

194;49.0;1.0;22.0;Whenever I join a game it is very hard to play because of high latency. I leave to join another and of course I can't pick my own server so it throws me into another lag infested server. Thanks a lot for not letting me choose my own server. What a horrible game!;Horrible lag
202;50.0;1.0;22.0;"The single player campaign is intense, but the real value in the COD franchise games is in the Multiplayer. There, MW2 fails like no other COD game before. Why the developer would do something like this is beyond me.

Multiplayer = Terrible
180;51.0;1.0;21.0;This game is a huge disappointment and as a PC Gamer I am disgusted by the way Infinity Ward has stabbed us all in the back.

199;53.0;1.0;21.0;This game is NOT worth your money - the PC Version.\n\nShort and simple, it has had features from the previous version, and all standard PC FPS games, REMOVED.  The price has increased by $10 when all the perks of owning the PC version are no longer present.  No dedicated servers, no console, no custom maps and mods - this is a gimped version of a great game.  It is obvious the developers have abandoned the PC gamer and do not deserve your money.\n\nIf you are used to playing FPS on your PS3 and other consoles, this will not directly affect you.  You can read online at numerous sites for very detailed reviews.  As a PC gamer, stay far far away from this atrocity.;Console game ported to PC
210;54.0;1.0;21.0;For console players this game will be a step up but for the PC it's nothing but a step backwards. Infinity Ward found its success thanks to the PC gaming community and in its latest installment the only lesson learned is that gratitude is a fleeting sentiment.\n\nYou'll be better off waiting for competing products from the likes of DICE in months to come but if you must play modern warfare then be prepared for constant host swaps, unreliable pings, a lack of community and don't even think about leaning to look around a corner. The single player storyline is recycled and uses the same gimmicks that were hardly fresh in the first title and if you were among the numerous complaints that the single player of Call of Duty 4 was short then the single player campaign of Modern Warfare 2 will be over before you can bat an eyelash.\n\nCall of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is, perhaps, the greatest step back a successful video game franchise has taken with a single release.;A 60$ Slap in the Face
168;55.0;1.0;20.0;Welcome to the future of PC gaming, where your $2000 rig is effectively neutered to play like a $300 console on MW2. IW and Activision are selling a game that is LESS of a game than CoD4 in terms of functionality. IF you buy this, you're buying a PC game that has been completely ported to a console format.\n\nAll of the other one-star reviews should spell it out very clearly. Since MoH:AA, 2015 and IW ONLY had the support of PC gamers. PC gamers made this franchise what it is. Now? Now we're worthy of being written off for the sake of the almighty dollar. If your idea of thanking your fans and supporters is to spit on them, then you must be IW.;No dedicated servers = no fun

187;57.0;5.0;20.0;if you buy the game, unlock all the weapons and perks and still don't like this game, thats one thing. but people need to stop giving this bad reviews because they don't allow hacking or they don't allow you to kick players that are too good or too bad etc.  I hated world at war because it seemed like every match was private.  when i found a match i got kicked because i was too good.  Not to mention people hacking and pirating the game.  Hopefully more pc games do this because pc gamers are never happy and always complaining.;stop whinning
161;58.0;1.0;19.0;Infinity Ward can pick the corn out of my poo for shipping this game as is.

It is good only for a run through the single payer mission....which is OK but very short...maybe 6 hours.\n\nSave your money. Would make for a good rental, if you could, but no real replay value. At least rent the console version before you buy it, as that is exactly what you are getting with this 'PC' version.

Well IW killed the competitive community so why not the modding community as well?\n-Locked at a dreadfully low 65 FOV.

184;68.0;1.0;17.0;Infinity Ward treats the PC version and community like garbage. This is by far worse than any EA DRM such as Spore. What they did was gut all features that made the PC version of any game special, such as Dedicated Servers, Mod tools, Modifications period, and the graphic tooling a PC version gets. Instead they locked down everything in the name of IWnet so they can sell you DLC or map packs, and force you into DRM, controlling everything you do. Oh and they raised the price, did I mention that? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!;DO NOT BUY

Another great game at a price--yes, even $60--that is actually cheaper than games sold just ten years ago when calculated in 2009 dollars.\n\nBut here's the sad part: when no company wants to risk releasing a game on the PC in the future, all we'll have to do is look here on the pages of Amazon reviews to find out why. Hope you like consoles because the sad fact is that the one-star naysayers are pounding the nails in the coffin of the PC game at an alarming rate.;Enjoy it while you still can...

114;74.0;5.0;15.0;">>> Update: 26 Dec 2010:  First off, the Amazon ""fun meter"" is broken! I am trying to rate this game for 5-stars of ""fun"", but the ""fun meter"" does not budge from 1 star.  Now, I am happy to report that Steam is very, very much improved!  The highest compliment that I can give it is that it no longer interferes in any negative way when you are playing a game that requires it.  Once you're past the installation process and establish your Steam account, you're free to enjoy your game.\n\nNow, I did buy COD Modern Warfare 2, on a half-price sale from another online vendor for $29.95 back in late November.  I got it purely for single-player action.  I get all the multi-player action I want from ordinary day-to-day life on a planet with 7 billion other people.\n\nThe single player is just absolutely frantic, high-intensity, frighteningly accurate, and completely immersive.  It delivers a degree of visual reality that is simply stunning (an overused word that is completely appropriate here).  The plot lines are intricate and too plausible -- I dreamed about some of them at night.\n\nAnd, yes, I guess it seemed like it a bit short, and yes, I'm sure to buy Black Ops next... when somebody puts it on sale for half-price.  If you're a multi-player, you are probably justified in disliking the game and the support structure it has.  If you're like me and only do single-player, then be advised that Steam is OK now and you'll have a great time.  Fine-tune your gaming mouse because you will need to be at your best to do well in this game! <<<\n\nA guy at work bought the hooptie edition of this game with the night vision toy. What a joke! He even had to go buy batteries to run this thing and we all laughed at him.  But the part I can't stand is that even if all you want to do is enjoy single-player action, with no interaction with anybody else in a multi-player mode, you still have to go through all the agony of dealing with STEAM!\n\nI hate and despise Steam.  It ruined my ability to play the Half Life franchise, starting with HL2.  I swore then that I'd NEVER buy any game that REQUIRES you to link up to Steam for any reason, especially having the wretched thing running your game for you.\n\nSo, as much as I've enjoyed Call of Duty up 'till now, I'll never buy another issue in this franchise until they make involvement with Steam an OPTION, and not a requirement.  I guess they're making tons of money off this game, but none of it will be mine....";Steam is no longer horrible.  They FIXED it... now, all of us single-players can enjoy this game, a LOT!
0;75.0;1.0;15.0;Y en espaol lo hago!\nEste juego es asombroso! pero mataron la versin de PC haciendola como si de consola se tratara :S\n?/10;I am first to Review! XD
182;76.0;1.0;15.0;They basically downgraded this PC juggernaut into a console game, if I wanted the console version I would have bought the console version. I've bought every IW Call of Duty on PC since the start of the franchise, not getting this one. As an ex-clan leader from the vCOD days the whole MP system is just dumb and is a complete regression on MP.;Console game on PC
142;77.0;1.0;14.0;The game has a lot to live up to when compared to its father COD:MW. The single player is similar to the first version of the game. It is very fun at times. Occasionally it feels like you just get thrown into things with very little explanation. They did not put as much thought into this version as they did the last. The graphics are basically the same as lat versions as well. That isn't a bad thing because the previous version had great graphics at that time.\n\nUnfortunately that's all the good things about MW2. The multiplayer is one of the worst I have ever seen. Almost all games are forced by MW2's proprietary system to be 6v6. It also removes dedicated servers from the situation. You have very little control over what your gameplay experience will be. There are already cheaters and hackers in the game and there is nothing you can do about it except leave. (Since there can be no admin no one can be kicked). It has been hit or miss for some people whether you get a lag free experience. And since there are no dedicated servers the game is hosted on one of the player's computer. If he leaves you basically get put on hold until another computer is made the host. This has caused problems for many people. Even though this game bears the Call of Duty name, it is but a shadow of what made Call of Duty great. Many people will still purchase it but it really is a middle of the road game. I have played for a day or so, but I am already to move on to another game. This game just doesn't have the staying power of the previous versions. If this is the path of the COD series, I will not be purchasing any more.;Big disappointment
158;78.0;1.0;14.0;I got this game despite the fact i knew IW remove the key features that made me love COD4. I decide to give it a shot. I was disappointed more than i expected. Single player last almost 6 hours!?!?!? What is that? 6 hours?  Single player -> Fun but so short i couldn't taste it. And i put Veteran so i it can last longer.... Multi player...  LAG LAG LAG and i have two ISP so i can choose between DSL and Cable. I CANT'T choose with who to play what to play which map to play. When Host go out game stop , you have to wait. wait for people, wait to load pretty much you have to wait all the time for something in that game. not just regular waiting to load the game like in any normal game with dedicated servers. This game made me sick. I hate those guys from Infinity. I cant play with more than 18 people , not that i actually saw more than 14 together.... Pretty much i feel sorry for getting this game. Just going to use it untill Bad Company 2 is out for PC.\n\nDO NOT BUY! Unless you are mentally disabled person who doesn't care for good online experience. If you hate have fun online, if you don't know ANYONE and you are not part of group of people , and you do not have AT LEAST FIOS 20/20 DO NOT BUY this game.\n\nIf you doesn't care with who you play, don't care to have options, and love submission this is your game. If you like to be treated as dirt, If you like to be treated as garbage, If you like to be treated as slave, If you like your intelligence to be insulted buy this game.\n\nBut if you have at least a little bit self respect. And you want to be treated as a respected customer DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Because IW/activision will not respect gamers wishes. They just going to do whatever it takes to make more money, They will not care that you are willing to pay BUT to get what you want. No, they WILL take your money BUT NOT GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT!!!\n\nThis game could be the greatest hit ever for PC. But is THE GREATEST FAIL EVER FOR PC. I loved COD franchise, but as sad it is, this game killed it for PC.\nWell done InfinityWard. I bought all my games. But i know ill pirate my next COD game if they doesnt go back to all the stuff we had before.;Do NOT BUY!
163;79.0;1.0;14.0;I was excited for this game until the announcement of p2p multiplayer.  The single player is ok although not as good as the first.  The multiplayer on the other hand is terrible.;Major Dissapointment
173;80.0;1.0;14.0;As a huge COD4 fan, it pains me to say it, but this game absolutely sucks. Everything that was right about COD4 is gone, missing or completely dumbed-down.\n\nInfinity Ward made this game for the consoles (PS3, XBox 360) and then took that neutered version straight to the PC.\n\nRead the other reviews -- they are right. And there is no other way to put this then to state it plainly... Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 sucks.;Ugh, completely disappointing in every way
174;81.0;1.0;14.0;I hope this is not the start of a terrible PC trend.

Don't do it... make them patch full functionality back into the game first (the coding is all still there, being based on CoD4 by the way...).\n\nA very poor offering for IW's hard core fans of the game, who have been abandoned and cut adrift by the company, which doesn't yet realize or fully understand what they've lost.";A Simple Console Port...

185;84.0;1.0;14.0;Having grown up with the Call of Duty series ever since the first one, it was to my dismay to find that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been an utter disappointment.  The single player is short but sweet with fast pacing, action packed sequences that keeps you wanting to play like nearly all of their previous series.  Unfortunately the multiplayer amounts to nothing much than a console port and has lost what has made Call of Duty so uniquely fun.  Gone are the fast paced, momentum driven battles old, only to be replaced with unreliable client based hosting and generic console shooter with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nIf you have a console that can play the game, rent it, go have fun in single player and dabble around in multiplayer for a bit and save your money.  If you think the multiplayer is anything like the first Modern Warfare you're going to be in for a big disappointment.;Fun singleplayer, lackluster multiplayer... rent it for console...

196;86.0;1.0;14.0;"In my experience, games (especially sequels) should get better as time goes on. However, MW2 took the complete opposite and made what WAS once a great franchise into a monstrosity of a game. As mentioned in so many reviews this game has completely killed off any sort of customer friendly tools and options. It lacks almost a 100% of features that MW1 came with that made the game so great. There isn't really much to say that hasn't been said here but if you're expecting greatness you won't find it here, this game has redefined the meaning of ""hype"" save your money and go get some pop/pizza and Battlefield 2 for $10 and have a blast online with a game that includes vehicles and everything else this doesn't.

That's right guys, the time tested server list is gone, no longer are you allowed to choose which games you want to play. IWNet will do it for you.

This may seem like a small complaint but it is proof positive that this game was intended for consoles and consoles only, and that buying it on the PC is really not worth it except for the improved graphics, and yes they are improved by a huge margin this time around.

I like to play a game with tactics, so I play crouch only with limited burst runs from cover to cover and limited perks with almost no kill streak items. Instead all the servers are bunny hopping sprinting no realism wastes of my time. Our COD4 server is a beefy monster that often hosts max player games, but we can not do this with MW2.

I buy these games to play online and have fun, yes I do play the solo missions just for the sake of playing it, but it's not my main reason to buy an FPS shooter game.

However, the price is now only $20 on PC, so it's definitely worth buying (was questionable at original $60 release price I had paid).\n\nBAD:\nThe PC version didnt' just get relegated to the back seat in favor of consoles; it got shoved in the trunk.\n\nThe ""removal"" of lean (Q or E to peek around corners, in use since COD1) in PC version is a travesty (why not just remove from only console versions?).  You now have to walk/run Rambo around corners and get shot up, without any idea of what enemies or terrains lie ahead, which really detracts from the gameplay and realism.  I guess we're ""lucky"" they didn't remove crouch and prone as well.\n\nYou HAVE to install Steam, and MW2 installs in its subdirectory.  If you prefer to install to a non-system hard drive partition (ex. D:), but have Steam installed in C:, you're out of luck (and 11GB) and will want to reinstall Steam to the other hard drive/partition.\n\nMUCH less graphic and audio tweak options than previous COD and other PC games.  It's officially a console port now.\n\nOther posters have already detailed the multiplayer issues with MW2, but the much smaller gameplay and no server mods are especially disappointing.  No kick/ban now, so you can't play for 30 minutes without cheaters/hackers ruining the game.  I'll stick with original MW1 for multiplayer.\n\nGOOD:\nGraphics are quite good, but sometimes skips frames once or twice per stage (I have Core 2 Quad Q6600 + 8800 GTS).  Interesting use of snowstorm (obscures vision) and ice-climbing mechanics; snowmobile's fun and new, but the ""heat-seeking"" handgun bullets while riding is ridiculous.\n\nNew weapons to try out.  Dual-wield with left & right buttons controlling them individually.  The riot shield is an interesting addition (blocks bullets but you can't shoot, although you can melee with it).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI'd still have purchased this regardless (had pre-ordered months ago), but am quite disappointed in Infinity Ward's shafting of the PC customers.  If there's a next release, I'll definitely wait until all the customer reviews are out.\n\nPC was where MW1 (COD4) shined with betters graphics, customizations, and servers, but I'd definitely rate MW2 below MW1 (COD4), and perhaps even COD5.  They could've just kept MW1 mechanics and multiplayer, used this new storyline and new maps with improved graphics, then shipped it, but decided to cripple it.";"PC version crippled; COD4 had better multiplayer"
135;98.0;1.0;12.0;If you are reading these reviews, you've already passed a ton of rants, so here goes a quick summary:\n\nSingle Player\n- They spent no time in making a decent plot for the campaign. It is confusing not because you are stupid, but because there is no plot.\n- Not any different than any other FPS war game.. of which there are many.\n- Nothing new.. seriously.. nothing. Replay Modern Warfare 1 if you are bored, or better yet, play Operation Flashpoint.\n- It only lasts 4-5 hours on hard mode.\n\nMulti-player\n- Mainly a rehash of old MW\n- New kill-streak perks are nice\n- No Mods\n- No Clans\n- No Clan-adminned servers\n- No dedicated servers (not that you haven't read that in that last 100 reviews)\n- No Custom Maps\n- Peer-to-peer games means if someone quits mid-round, you have to pause until everyone reconnects. Say goodbye to fast paced fun;A game you'll play for 2 days and throw away.. just what IW wants - DO NOT BUY
137;99.0;1.0;12.0;IW increased the price to $60 for no reason other than greed and removed a ton of features.  I'm suprised they chose to support the mouse and keyboard instead of requiring an xbox controller to play it on the pc.  IW will not allow or support any custom modding or maps.  Don't waste your money just keep playing the first modern warfare.;IW hates PC gaming

141;101.0;1.0;12.0;CoD:MW2 features a 5-6 singleplayer campaign, a step back in PC gaming (15 years ago we had listen servers, not anymore!), no lean, no modding tools or console commands, no ability to kick/ban players in rated matches, high pings when not the host (and when you are you have 0 ping while everyone else has ~150-200 if you're lucky), no leaning, only 9v9 multiplayer.\n\nNot only that, they're charging an extra $10 for this!\n\nThe list really just goes on and on people.\n\nThis game was originally developed as a console game that was just ported to PC by adding mouse support, it's quite obvious.\n\nPlease for the love of everything, do not buy this game for PC. This game embodies all that is going wrong in PC gaming, and if you're buying it, you're supporting PC gaming going into the crapper.;This game is a step backwards for PC gamers
146;102.0;1.0;12.0;Don't buy this. Only you guys can break this trend. Devs. are really getting out of line. Boycott and if they wan't us to by it then lower the price where it should be. 30 dollars!;60 dollars for this game on pc? not worth it.
150;103.0;1.0;12.0;I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This game is a joke, and representational of the attitude Infinity Ward has towards their customers & fans.\n\nFirst off, single player campaign is only 4-6 hours long...For a $60 game that's completely ridiculous. I don't care how proud of the campaign IW is, it's not that great anyway.\n\nSecond, Multiplayer is complete garbage. IWNET doesn't work, bad lag is common, graphics are not impressive, steam anti-cheat doesn't work (already hacked), no dedicated servers, no server browser, no clan support, etc. etc.;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
153;104.0;1.0;12.0;If you enjoy PC gaming just keep playing CoD4. This game will be far less enjoyable as they have downgraded the online component in EVERY respect.;Console port
191;105.0;4.0;12.0;"Edit: Although it is somewhat expected, I am still surprised by how this review deemed 'unhelpful'? I would really appreciate your comment if you think it is 'unhelpful'. Please, don't just discredit reviewers or this game without even trying/playing/or even look at others playing the game. It is a 'REVIEW'...if any of you do not understand the definition of 'REVIEW', please buy a dictionary; heck, you may even get the definition online for free.\n\nUpdate: After two days of playing (roughly 6 hours of online game play) and advanced from Lv. 1 to Lv. 19, I have only encountered TWO instances(servers) that my ping will show 'yellow' instead of 'green'. While there are some instances in the game that will show some shutter, they last just 1-2 seconds and everything will be back to normal. There are also ONE instance which the host disconnect during gameplay and the system takes approximately less a minute to find and re-setup the game which returns to normal(like nothing had happened). I agree this is the downside of this random 'host' system and some GOOD dedicated servers (these will still happen with cheap/high latency servers) can minimize these inconveniences. Please note I would only refer to these as 'inconveniences' as I don't the game deserve 1 star just by these few minutes of break. To be fair, at least for me, 1 star are granted to those games that are very close to 'unplayable'. Maybe it is just me, I am really having a hard time trying to understand how this game could be 'unplayable'.\n\nI, too, consider the $60 MSRP ridiculous and a shame for IW to have such decision. However, I based my review on the $20 promotion which renders it a better buy; if it is at $60, the game at best will have 3 stars. I mean, that's another dilemma in this capitalist world. The company can charge whatever they want for their products - there is not like price ceiling imposed or anything - $49.99 price is just a unspoken industry trend. If you think it is too much, don't buy it - as simple as that. A 'REVIEW' system, as I mentioned above, is for those who share their experience AFTER they experienced the game - We just to know what is your experience with the gameplay itself but NOT your experience how sad it is you couldn't afford the game for whatever reason (I find it pretty hard to belief one could not afford the game if their system satisfied the requirement (cost at least ~600) for a smooth gameplay). I find it 'STUNNING' to see why people can rate 'Crysis' five stars knowing that their system may not even run it smoothly or need additional $1000+ upgrade just to able to play it but not give this game a break? I know some will counter me saying that at least one can spend $1000 to upgrade their system just to play Crysis - may I offer your a solution to those who 'afraid' (just afraid, not actually expereinced) shutter/delay/lag while playing online? Upgrade your internet connection to the top tier grade even it is $100 per month (mine cost ~$80).\n\n** This is only a brief preliminary review on the multiplayer aspect of the game. If I have more time on the game, I may extend it a little. One thing for sure, the graphics are noticeably better than MW1.\n\n** Maybe I should clarify my specs since your computer spces and Internet connection are directly related to your gaming experience.\n  My review is based on: Core i7 OC-ed to 3.6Ghz...6GB DDR3 1600...GTX 260 Core 216...ASUS p6T...playing on 1680x1050\n  Internet Connection: Download: 12Mbps up to 16Mbps; Upload: 1.5Mbps\n\nI got the game this morning via Fedex. After installing the game, the FIRST thing I did is to jump into multi-player.\n\nIf you have been following the critics the last few weeks, you will no doubt knowing that the biggest uproars amongst PC players is the complete omission of the dedicated server functionality. As a long time PC gamers whose sole interest is on the fun and ever-changing multiplayer aspect of online gaming, I too was concerned about the decision and frustrated by the IW's seemingly selfish decision (for the sake of making more money rather than open up the game). I, too, has signed the petition and have once decided to boycott the game. However, forgive me, with the $20 credit towards future purchase I decided to go ahead and pre-order it (the only reason I get hooked is because I can use the credit towards L4D2 which will release next week). I just want to try it out and the worst thing I figure is to throw $40 into trash.\n\nTo be honest, I am genuinely surprised by how quick it is to find a game room and the gameplay is smooth as butter! I haven't checked the ping myself...but why do I need to? Regardless whether it is 1ms or 100ms, they are just numbers and as long as it runs smoothly I am a happy camper. Don't get too hooked by just the numbers; as long as it stays below 100ms, you shouldn't have notice any significant shutter. I mean to be honest, how many of you can really say you benefit from the difference between a 3200dpi or a 6000dpi mouse sensitivity? Only the pros can tell.\n\nPlease make no mistake, while I am happy with the online performance - I STILL THINK IW SHOULD ADD BACK THE DEDICATED SERVER OPTION!! It is just the right thing to do. Open up the game to the world and there are tons of talents minds who will develop mods and things that will only refine the game - and as such, generate even better reputation and extend the longevity of the gameplay - which in your company term, MORE MONEY!!!";Much better than expected!

Facts - The majority of these people haven't even purchased the game and they are only rating it that way out of protest. This is the vast majority of reviews right now for the PC version on Amazon. If this game was so bad then why are the other console versions so high in the ratings? Why has the vast majority of MAJOR critics given the game such high honors? I HAVE the game. This game is everything I wanted it to be and more. The fact that online play is limited to smaller teams I believe is a great thing. Opinion - I have no interest in playing with 64 people on a map that is so small that you die three times while spawning. Fact - Graphics are unbelievable. Opinion - For that reason alone I believe this game is worth every penny. Fact - People don't have jobs right now. Opinion - This is the true reason why there is such a protest against this game. I believe that IW has made this game harder to pirate, and that is why there is such an outcry. No Dedicated Server - I can see a point to this, but Clans will find a way.

I wish I had read more about the game before I bought it, no wonder Infinity Ward hid so much of the game before release, since it blows.";Mo money mo suck
119;114.0;2.0;11.0;"Although this release is one of the biggest of all time, it will most assuredly be looked upon as a case study for any future developers.\nI rank this release debacle up there with Star Wars NGE.\nThe outrage shown by PC gamers being ignored is nothing short of incredible.

127;115.0;1.0;11.0;"As a fan of Pc gaming and the Call of Duty franchise i was greatly disappointed in the much anticipated Modern Warfare 2. Everything that I know and love about Call of Duty 4 have been removed, leaving behind a crippled port of the console version. I would recommend spending your hard earn cash else where.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2/dp/B00269QLI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a>";DO NOT BUY!
133;116.0;1.0;11.0;Yes, this is Call of Duty 3.5 not 4.5. This is not an incremental update to CoD4, it is actually a downgrade. This game is a step backwards from its predecessor CoD4:MW. If you buy this game, you are paying a greater price for what amounts to a stripped down CoD4. The game makes some refinements to CoD4's multiplayer but follows the same formula and does nothing new or innovative. The engine is recycled and is showing its age.\n\nDedicated servers have been removed from the game. Dedicated servers and modding are what extend the life of a game when the formula gets old. Multiplayer deathmatches are now limited to a paltry 6v6, which is anything but epic. Clanners will be hurt most by this. The matchmaking system is also very flawed and laggier than a dedicated server. There is no option to opt out of hosting, or to choose to host, and if the host leaves, it will take several seconds to choose another host.\n\nYou cannot even select what map to play. The online service IWnet has full control over the parameters of the game you're joining. If you don't like the map, the best you can do is cast a vote to skip to the next map, and you will need a majority vote. Or you can leave the game and hope for better luck joining the next. If you find an annoying, racist or offensive gamer has joined your game you won't even have the option to boot or ban him. Players have almost zero control over the game's administration.\n\nThe single player experience is great but will be over in one afternoon. The multiplayer lacks the longevity to last the years that CoD4 will. If you are PC gamer, do not buy this game. You will not be getting the standard features you'll come to expect from a PC FPS, and this is worrisome for the future of PC gaming.\n\nI haven't even scratched the surface on what's wrong with this game. If you have to buy it, buy it used, or just play the single player at a friend's place. Hardcore PC gamers should not stand for this. If you already own CoD4, stick to that game. It is the superior one. MW2 does not offer enough incentive to abandon CoD4.\n\nSave the future of the PC gaming industry. Do not allow other developers to get away with skimping on PC gamers the way IW has. Do not allow $60 to become the accepted price tag for PC games! If you support this game, you are doing fellow PC gamers are disservice. If you want an alternative shooter, I would suggest Battlefield Bad Company 2 which is proud of the fact that it does include dedicated servers and isn't a sloppy console port.;Call of Duty 3.5
134;117.0;1.0;11.0;Infinity ward did a lousy port of a console game to the PC. The lack of dedicated servers forces us to a lag fest, leaning was removed because the xbox controller doesn't have enough buttons, custom maps are gone because they don't want ppl to be able to compete with the paid DLC, there are no mods so there will be no promod or pam mod for competitive, and if all of this wasn't enough they want us to pay premium price for a gimped product!;Rip-Off
145;118.0;1.0;11.0;This review sure is bittersweet. Without a doubt, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is my favorite game of all time. I got that game the first week it came out without bothering to even read a review, given IW's reputation and past experience. I have been looking forward to this game the moment I beat MW.\n\nI was given a gift card in May, 2009. I promptly pre-ordered MW2 and StarCraft II. Since I used up all my funds with these two games, I threw away the card. A few weeks ago, I learned about how IW crippled MW2. I wish I had not thrown away the gift card, for I would have canceled the pre-order.\n\nDespite all reservations, hesitations, doubts, uncertainties about the news on a lack of dedicated server, I held optimism for IW to pull through with IWNet. Despite all what my head tells me on this would be a mortal blow to this PC game, my heart said that the game will be great.\n\nThen, I heard of the news that IW has lowered the maximum player content to 18 players.\n\nI finally received the game yesterday, and I crossed my fingers and hoped the game was as good as IW's previous work. It finished installing this morning from the 11GB download off of steam. (I do not know why it had asked me to download the game, when I had the 2 game DVDs, it's as if it took 2 dual layered DVDs to install the inane Steam client.)\n\nThis morning, I loaded up single player, boosted up the resolution, and fired away at the first mission. It gave me all the good chills that the original did. But alas, I hear the single player is short, and not very replayable. Multiplayer is where I game, multiplayer is where I breathe.\n\nI started playing, and got a kill right away. Good old times. Then the lag hit. Then the host left, and it took awhile for the game to find a new host. It is not instantaneous, it takes about a minute to reload the game. More lag.\n\nConclusion: if they do not patch this game up, this will be the very last IW game I will ever buy (actually, that will be MW, since I got this game for free. You can see how disappointed I am if I am complaining this much over a FREE game I got.)\n\nNo self-respectable PC gamer will ever live down this insult shoved upon us by Activision, and their newest bed-mate: Infinity Ward.;Everything that can be said... has been said.
151;119.0;1.0;11.0;Due to there being no dedicated server support I cannot give this game anything above 1 star. All I get is constant lag (and I have a 60mb/s connection w/Verizon Fios). I am selling my copy today and pre-ordering Battlefield Bad Company 2. Infinity Ward should be ashamed of themselves... especially after charging $10 more compared to the console version.;Horrid Multiplayer Experience
188;120.0;1.0;11.0;"9v9 Max? (6v6 in TDM)\nNo dev console?\nNO DEDICATED SERVERS?\n\nNo thanks, jerks.\nIf they wanted to ""improve"" the multiplayer experience, try starting with something that has been working for over a decade (dedicated servers), instead of starting with a system that has been proven to be full of fail time and time again (matchmaking: see Op Flashpoint or FEAR 2).\n\nWay to screw the entire PC community that made the franchise what it is today.\nDon't buy this game if you were expecting CoD4 level of multiplayer.";No console ports, please.
189;121.0;1.0;11.0;First, basic gameplay changes like not being able to lean(seriously? this has been present from the beginning of the COD series).\nDidn't play all the way through the campaign yet, but it really isn't anything groundbreaking, and as far as multiplayer is concerned all I have to say is, 9v9 limit and matchmaking on a PC? What were they thinking....\n\nThe game play itself feels alright, but the complete lack of dedicated server and especially mod support is just scary. Mods like HoB have molded previous CoD games into a much more enjoyable experiences than this series can provide in stock mode.  I have created maps for several of the previous call of duty games and I have seen first hand how the creativity of the community is what really made this series great until now. I think IW's decision to take this away from us has produced a much less than acceptable game in Modern Warfare 2. This game is a giant step backwards for PC gaming. If you are looking for a complete console experience, then by all means buy this game, but if you are used to any of the benefits that PC gaming has typically provided, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nEdit: went back to play a little today on multiplayer, and all I have to say is this game is going in the trash, the game has only been out for a day and hacks galore are available and being used. So much for more secure servers, now we don't even have the power to ban and kick hackers, we have to wait for IW's slow arses. Pitiful excuse for a PC game.;Horrible decisions by IW
190;122.0;1.0;11.0;Do not buy this game. Don't say that we didn't warn you.\n\nAnd to think that 'COD United Offensive' 2004 was its high water mark!\n\nIf they can not handle making Modern Warfare games then just go back to WWII.;Horrible !!!!!!!!
52;123.0;1.0;10.0;"The Call of Duty series originated on the PC.  Its wild success established Infinity Ward as one of the greatest development studios and enabled them to offer future releases on other platforms. Infinity Ward reached the pinnacle of its success with the release of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which had a thrilling, albeit somewhat brief, single player campaign and a revolutionary multiplayer experience that became, and still remains, the gold standard for first person shooters.\n\n With its release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Infinity Ward has continued to amp up the intensity, if not the duration, of the single player game, but has ruined the multiplayer experience that contributed to Call of Duty 4's incredible sustained popularity.  Other reviewers here have adequately summarized the embarrassing deficiencies.  Notice that even otherwise ""positive"" reviews acknowledge that the multiplayer has some serious problems.  For example, IGN says: ""The PC version is also locked to the same restrictions as the other versions, so 32 person matches are a thing of the past, you can't create dedicated servers for match hosting, and that also will result in a lack of future mod support and PC-specific expansion. ...this is definitely a downside for those familiar with the expandability of PC gaming and freedom that comes with a more open source platform, ....  It'll hurt the hardcore PC community, but it's a decision IW made.""\n\n With Modern Warfare 2, Infinity Ward has failed to meet basic industry standards and consumer expectations.  If the multiplayer changes had been necessary in order to implement some new features, such as cross platform matches (PC v. XBOX or PS3), then maybe I could understand, but there is no such added functionality.  Bottom line: pay more for less, MUCH less.\n\n Infinity Ward decided to lobotomize the PC multiplayer experience long ago in the development process, and must have known the overwhelmingly negative reaction that would follow, but they said NOTHING until shortly before release, after many had preordered.  This deceptive betrayal plainly reveals their disrespect and contempt for the PC gaming fans of the Call of Duty series.\n\n Activision and Infinity Ward are attempting to establish new, lower, industry standards for the PC gaming experience by removing key features in order to save development costs, and thus increase their overall profitability.  If they succeed here, then other studios and publishers will soon follow suit.  Take a stand.  Do not buy this game until basic multiplayer functionality is restored, or at least until the price of the game fairly reflects its value.";A tragic waste
83;124.0;1.0;10.0;MW2 could be a good game if the developers actually catered to their audience.  Instead they examined all of the problems and challenges that console gamers have and made a game that fits the lowest common denominators--and therefore granted the PC all of the downfalls of the console.\n\nThe weapons are not as distinct as they were in CoD4.  It's hard to find a weapon that stands out as they all the weapons in a class sound and feel very similar.\n\nSingle player was dreadfully short.\n\nSpecial Ops was the highlight for me.  It's a new mode to the CoD franchise, and it is pretty fun.  Now if we could get a game like that that has all the fine tuning PC gamers expect it would be a great addition to an otherwise lackluster game.;PC players dissed
125;125.0;1.0;10.0;"I was eagerly awaiting this game and all the excellent reviews it received made me happy to finally have it in my hands. What can I say; I should have paid closer attention to the reader reviews, and not the biased reviews of game journalists that line their pockets with free gifts and ad revenue from Activision.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I can safely tell you that the story of MW2 can be completed in less than 5 hours. I took my time and explored the game. I was extremely disappointed to find out that the game is so short, but it is being touted as a ""multiplayer"" game, so I quickly jumped on line.\n\nLet me say that my experience with the game was even worse from that point on. I had friends drop from matches, and everyone was experiencing a lot of lag. We could not host the matches ourselves, and there are no dedicated servers, so the game would automatically pick the ""best"" host, causing our ping's to shoot up into the high 150's for most matches, sometimes reaching all the way into the 300+.\n\nWhat came as an even greater surprise was the fact that the game caps out at 9 vs 9 matches. Apparently 9 vs 9 is a ""multiplayer"" experience. All my hopes of large scale battles went away. Why does a PC game only support 9 vs 9 matches? What happened to 64 vs 64, or at least 32 vs 32. Imagine killing the same 9 people over and over again during the course of the match. Where is the fun in that?\n\nSoon after we encountered another issue. We could not kick players that would cheat or idle. This made some of the matches become basically 3 vs 5, and completely ruin the fun. Also when the ""host"" of the game leaves (remember, the game picks the ""best"" host for you) there is a delay before it finds another host. During this delay everyone basically waits and twiddles their thumbs.\n\nEventually we tried to figure out how to chat amongst ourselves... And we could not do so! The game has no party chat. What ""multiplayer"" game in this day and age has no party chat? Communicating with your team members is essential, but this is absent from the game!\n\nI can go on and on about the huge lag spikes, higher price point, lack of console access, weird exploits that render your opponent immortal, but why bother? I believe I already made my point that you should NOT be buying this game on the PC.\n\nIf you want a great FPS, wait for Battlefield Bad Company 2, which not only has all the features Modern Warfare 2 is missing, but actually looks like it will have the support of the modding community, which Modern Warfare 2 does not.";A complete waste of money: the single player story is only 5 hours long and key multiplayer features are missing.
63;126.0;1.0;9.0;Well after reading other reviews and issues concerning this game. I do not think this is worth buying for the PC. Main reason for me is it does not support dedicated servers. Seems to me to be nothing more than a piss poor port of a console game. I will just wait for Bad Company 2 for the pc.;Rather wait for Bad Company 2
65;127.0;1.0;9.0;What everyone else is saying.  It is seriously worthless to me since I am an online player not focused on singleplayer.  DO NOT BUY IT IF YOU PLAY ONLINE.;Ditto
67;128.0;3.0;9.0;"OK, I know on all platforms they sold over 7 million copies, 12% was PC. It looks like they put forth 12% of effort to port this marvel from console. Come on! No advanced graphics options, is this PC or what? No lean? Can't kick hackers? Host migrating? No actual ping displayed? No mods? No dedicated servers? Most weapons sound like silenced variants. Almost no recoil.\n\nBut I bet we will get plenty of DLC.\n\nSome SP mission are fun, including UAVs, I'll give you that. Scripted to hell, but it is still fun. Graphics is very crisp. Problem is it's about 4-5 hours long. Good movie these days is about $10 for 2hr+ flick. So about $5/hr of entertainment. With CODMW2 you shell out $60 for 4hr, thus paying $15/hr.\n\nIt is a sad fact that game development of major A title costs upward of $40 million. Mainstream gaming has been heading console direction for a while. There are many reasons for that. This is very good example of the trend.\n\nEDIT: More thoughts on SP gameplay... (I didn't even bother to spend a lot of time in MP.) Since MW2 took after World at War, it is very irritating when game switches between characters all the time. Quickly you lose track of who is who. Plot is impossible to figure out. I wished MW1 continued... May be I'm getting old but in order to enjoy hectic combat you really need to be a 14 y/o high on red bull with strobe lights flashing and techno blasting at the same time. Half of the time your screen will be splattered in red with ""RELOADING"" blinking... No matter where you turn, there are always at least four new enemies pop up like jack in the box at your 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock and you never have time to reload. This game tries to be serious and Serious Sam at the same time. Jeebus Chroist, pick your poison and stick to it, Infinity Ward! I really enjoyed MW1, combat was tense where needed, not non-stop glow stick fest at the Annual Big Rave. And yes, you will miss no-lean in about 2 minutes into the game. And yes, AI can lean and use cover to fire...\n\nOn a positive note: Game runs very smoothly maxed out and what features that still remained in the game were pretty well polished. Voice acting, motion capture, models, explosions are superb. I'm running it on Windows 7 64bit, E8400, 4G of RAM, HD 4890 and 2 Intel X-25m in RAID-0. Not totally surprised since there is almost no draw distance (try Arma2 for a change ;-) Also I liked smartly designed level loading, while you watch pretty meaningless movie, game will be loading in the background.";PC gaming is dying
69;129.0;1.0;9.0;The fact that activision felt the need to treat pc gamers like a bunch of idiots is simply amazing. Their outright greed in pricing the game $10 higher than normal retail with no justifiable reason sets a dangerous precedent for the industry that I just can't condone. Some might call this a by-product of capitalism, after all it's their game and they can charge what they want, but then I won't support this precedent by purchasing the game. The lack of dedicated servers and mod support despite the overwhelming preference of pc gamers for support of these features is just spitting in the face of gamers. The fact that they only did this in order to force dlc on gamers instead of letting the community support the game by making their own custom maps and server settings is seriously troubling. Oh, and did I mention that the new servers already have hackers on them, only this they can't be banned by server admins, since, well, their aren't any server admins since we have no dedicated servers. This whole ordeal has seriously become a fiasco and a lesson in how not to treat a pc release. Sure the game will still sell millions, but ultimately, it won't have the longevity and support from the pc community it could have. Infinityward had the chance to make something special, but perhaps through no fault of their own, the pc version has been crippled beyond belief. There's a reason pc gamers shell out the money for a nice rig rather than going the console route, and with Call of Duty, all those reasons were simply flushed down the toilet.;not gonna stand for activision treating pc gamers like this

Infinity ward seems to be marketing towards the game console community these days.\n\nPS. I also have an Xbox 360 and refuse to buy FPS game for it, because they all ways feel like I'm running/turning/shooting in molasses.;Not for the PC gamers SADLY.....
74;131.0;1.0;9.0;There is a lack of dedicated servers, latency issues on the listen server-only IWNET(Infinity Ward NETwork), lack of console commands, lack of support for matches larger than 18 players, and inability to vote to kick and ban cheating players immediately, this is one of the most locked-down, inflexible, and gamer-unfriendly, game ever created. Also your not buying the game on the disk your buy a validation code on the back of the manual, you download the game though Steam, and you need an internet connection to download the actual game.\n\nAnd the campaign is short only six and half hours, I paid over sixty dollars for this!;Avoid!
77;132.0;1.0;9.0;Well, I just finished the campaign mode, and I REALLY enjoyed the single player of this game.  If you liked Modern Warfare 1 single player, you will enjoy MW2 single player.  The downside is that the single player is REALLY short.  I finished it in about 4-5 hours in regular difficulty.\n\nThat said, I really enjoyed MW1 multiplayer and was looking forward to MW2 multiplayer.  However, on the PC, this was a horrible experience.  Right off the bat, you will realize that this game was designed for console systems.  The game auto selects a 'server' and you typically end up in a game with 7-9 other people.  The game says it supports up to 18 player multiplayer, but the most I ever saw was 10 total.  Latency was an issue as I am used to being able to pick a server at 15-30 ms pings, and now the best I get is 100ms (which the game nicely tries to mask as connection bars).  A good test of connectivity was trying to sprint.  In MW1 if I had a bad connection to a server, my sprint would always drop out and make me 'walk' again.  On a good server, this was never an issue.  In MW2, this is always an issue.  It is very difficult to sprint for your full duration without being dropped out early due to latency on it's automatically chosen 'best' server.\n\nRegarding gameplay, for some reason, the game feels more like World at War to me than it does like Modern Warfare 1.  It just doesn't feel as crisp or controlled.  Of course, I've only had the game for 2 days now, so maybe I need to give it more time.  The no lean thing also takes away from the gameplay.  Again, this is attributed to the game being developed for consoles.\n\nAnyways, bottom line.  At $60, if you REALLY enjoyed the single player in MW1, go for this.  If you are a console gamer, I suppose this is a good console game too.  If you are a PC gamer, the price is kind of steep for what you get.  It would have been better off as a $24.99 expansion to the single player game as MW1 multiplayer is far superior.;Fun Single Player - no Multiplayer
91;133.0;1.0;9.0;The single player is awefull. It's a rinse and repeat throw 100 guys at you from all direction and shoot your way out of a box. The graphics are good but showing thier age.\nI was expecting the single player to be good but surprised at how really unimaginative and boring it is.\n\nThe multiplayer is unplayable. No dedicated servers, random servers you are forced to play on with tons of lag.;This game is bad on all levels.
105;134.0;1.0;9.0;All i can say about this game is that i wasted money... i practically just gave some scammer $60, then got slapped in the face...!!! This game\nwas aimed at making profit and nothing else! Such a shame as i own every call of duty game, i loved them all until i received this one...\nTo tell you the truth i was REALLY disappointed too, because after COD MW1, and knowing how much fun that was playing! I was expecting something\nrelatively the same, but no i got a piece of garbage that was just hidden a box... I should have read the other reviews before buying...\nit was my fault =(.\n\nDON'T DO THE SAME MISTAKE I DID! DON'T WAIST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!;Worth as much as a ROCK!

112;136.0;5.0;9.0;I started playing this game today, and it is simply fantastic.  I jumped right into the multiplayer and although very different from what we are all used to playing it is done very well.  The games may be smaller, but are intense and fast paced.  IT is very easy to find a game and hop right in, and start killing or capturing flags or blowing stuff up.  I was not sure about the game when I first heard how it was going to be changed, but IW has done a great job and creating a pleasing experience.;MW2 review
116;137.0;1.0;9.0;"Since the firsts days of the Call of Duty franchise, the players played and loved these games, even to the point that some people even bothered to make modifications for these games. And now, after the amazing success of Call of Duty 4 & co, how Activion is thanking us, the (so called) PC crowd, those who bought their games in the past? By giving us a console port! No dedicated servers (you can't rent a server and manage it the way you want ex: kicking people), a limit of 18 players per game instead of 32 (just like the consoles, HOW convenient!) and they even decided to protect their wonderful servers with the inefficient VAC anti-cheats program made by Valve. Speaking of Valve, you must know that in order to play Modern Warfare 2 you must have Steam installed on your computer in order to play (what? You didn't know?). Of course, they're trying to convince us that replacing all that by what they're offering is a good deal... Matchmaking servers, which mean you no longer have to scroll through a ""painful"" list of servers (no more exercise for you fatties!), add a friend list (oh how creative) and the VAC anti-cheats (in cheaters language: open buffet, all-you-can-eat). In Left 4 Dead, they used the matchmaking concept and I absolutely hated it (you can deal with it since it's only 4 players per game, but 18?). Let's say that you're in a great game with funny players and bang you get disconnected for no reason, you'll never be able to join back that game because the matchmaking system will send you somewhere else... Wonderful isn't? I'm telling you, don't buy this game, don't encourage their lame practice business, vote like me, with your wallet.";A Day to be Remembered in Infamy.
120;138.0;1.0;9.0;If you are considering buying the PC version thanks to the long set precedent that the PC versions of shooters are ultimate FPS experience, you are in for a rude shock.\n\nLong standing FPS feature such as dedicated servers, the ability to kick and ban players from servers, the ability to make changes to certain game settings like your Field of View on the console are long gone.\n\nYou are left with a watered down experience that is a mere shadow of its predecessor in terms of accessiblity.\n\nInfinity Ward claimed that many of the changes they made were to make the game more secure and hack proof, yet the intarwebs are rife with videos of a hacked PC client already making the rounds.\n\nBy supporting this game, you are supporting the notion that it is OK to take out standard features that are a staple of the PC gaming community, and charge us the same amount for it.  Even the digital downloads of this game cost the exact same as a retail box copy, but you are only left with a disk and a sense of disappointment in yourself for having not spent your money elsewhere.\n\nIf you are dead set on buying a copy of Modern Warfare 2, I suggest you buy a used copy, where none of the proceeds actually make their way to Infinity Ward.;A Waste of Money for PC players
124;139.0;1.0;9.0;This game is a huge disappointment.  No dedicated servers, no mod tools and nothing like you've come to expect from the previous CoDs.  It's a shame, the CoD series was a shining example of how to do a great PC shooter and it's become nothing more than a poorly ported console game, and they charge $60 for a DRM laden, crippled version on top of that. Listen to the hundreds of reviews here and elsewhere: Do not buy, save your money.;Huge Disappointment!
132;140.0;1.0;9.0;No multi-play value for pc users who want to play with their clan mates. That alone earns this game a 1star out of 5.;Way to Go Infinity Ward...
143;141.0;1.0;9.0;CAUTION: this may contain slight SPOILERS\n\nUnlike most negative reviews here, I actually own and played this game.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the COD series. I own and enjoyed all of them, as well as Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (COD's spiritual predecessor). That said, this game is a huge disappointment. They took what made Modern Warfare great, and ruined the multiplayer. They added a part early on where the player participates in a civilian massacre at a Russian airport- having played through this part (which may be disturbing for many), I don't really think it adds much to the story and merely serves to drum up controversy and free press/hype for the game.\n\nThat said, the singleplayer is fun. If you liked the original [MW] single-player, you'll love this. The graphics are improved and runs smoothly on my PhenomII x4 w/ Radeon 4870 at 1920x1080 (didn't bother to run FRAPS, but it never hiccuped). The scripted in-game dialog and cinematics are flawless, and the story is captivating, with many throwbacks to MW (Capt Price and 'Soap' MacTavish are back!).\n\nIf single-player alone can justify the inflated price tag, then so be it.\n\nHowever, if you're like me, and spent the initial 10 hours beating MW single-player and happily wasted the next 50-100 hours in multiplayer, you'll be sorely disappointed:\n  1. No more dedicated servers.\n  2. Due to #1, no more custom mods.\n  3. No custom maps too. You'll have to buy these as DLC.\n  4. 18-player limit. Just like the console.\n  5. Game-matching interface geared towards quick matchmaking. Clan games will be a thing of the past here.\n  6. LAG!!! 100msec is unplayable. IW, if you can't allow dedicated servers, then fix yours!!!\n\nSo much for that 100-hour longevity of the original... I've already stopped playing this, and I went back to the original.\n\nSurely, the company did this in the consumers' best interest, did they? Coding up a dedicated server and increasing match sizes to be over 9-vs-9 isn't a daunting task. One could argue that this was done to curb piracy, but that argument becomes moot when there already are pirated MP servers, and the game requires online activation anyway.\n\nNo, the reason IW/Activision did this was to sell DLC mods and map packs to PC users. They wanted to turn the PC community into a cash cow that would buy all of the map packs and mods. No more free community mods. No more free maps. You'll have to give Activision more money instead.\n\nFor a company who owe their original success to PC gamers, Infinity Ward has sold out to the profit-centric mentality of Activision, and even went on the record to defend the soul-sucking and greedy comments made by the infamous Activision CEO, Bobby Kotick.\n\nMW2 will likely be my last IW game, on any platform.\n\nSummary: Fun singleplayer, intentionally-crippled multiplayer. If you want to reward companies who treat gamers like this, then by all means send them your money. I wish I hadn't bought this.\n\nWarning: Don't buy a USED copy of this game for the PC. Once activated with Steam, it becomes permanently linked to that account. Yes, even the retail version requires Steam. Not a complaint against Steam really, since I now embrace Steam as a necessary evil (its DRM is less-intrusive than StarForce rootkits or SecuROM install limits, and actually allows you to redownload previously-bought titles unlimited number of times on multiple PCs). But the biggest drawback is that titles on Steam cannot be transferred to another account or resold. So caveat emptor on buying the PC port used- you may end up with a worthless disc that will refuse to play.;Very Expensive Single-Player Game
148;142.0;1.0;9.0;Just look around at other reviews, they dumbed down the PC versions as far as they coul, then, called it an 'upgrade' to the game. Do not buy this, wait for Bad Compnay 2 which will destroy this game.;THis game is 100% port, and 100% disappointing.

[...];Amazing
3;146.0;5.0;8.0;I'm going to keep this short, but despite what people seem to be saying about this game, its superb. everything is nice and polished, the graphics look great and run smoothly meaning that the company took the time to optimize the game thoroughly. Some seem to not like this game because of 2 reasons: no dedicated servers and 18 players max playing together at one time. About the dedicated servers, its really hit or miss, but in my experience, It has worked the way it was intended and done it well. The host has a tiny tiny advantage, but not enough for me to ever notice it. As far as there only being 18 people playing at one time, if you have ever played counter strike, you know that when it gets to be more than 20ish people, its so chaotic that its not fun because of the pace of the game. The same is true for MW2, the game is so fast paced that if there were more than 18 people, you would be getting an instant head shot as soon as you spawn and wouldn't be as fun. what ever your preference, MW2 is some great, fast paced action that is just as challenging as it is satisfying. I think a lot of people who left reviews for this game think that this game is a PC designed game, and it is not, it is a port in every meaning of the word. that being said, its still a great game. If you cant stand no dedicated servers and low server cap, get Bad company 2, also a fantastic game. In the end, it all depends on your preference.;The best that consoles have to offer.
8;147.0;1.0;8.0;The graphics are OK, but the 1-player campaign mode is disappointing and very limited. The worst part is, online/multiplayer mode, which was absolutely AMAZING in CoD:MW, and in itself worth the price of the game, is now crippled in this MW2 version -- NO support for dedicated PC servers, and a limit of 9 players per side... are you KIDDING me??? how lame is that?!! So online play is laggy and jerky, and your connection just mysteriously drops out of nowhere. It's really horrible, especially given the online gameplay experience in the previous version of CoD... Shame on you, Activision and Infinity Ward. I want my money back.;huge let-down
23;148.0;1.0;8.0;Lag, LaG, LAG !!!!!\n\nI thought MW2 stood for Modern Warfare 2... but after playing it for many hours, I realize that MW stands for LAG X 2!\nI stood before an enemy and unloaded an entire clip from my M4 at a range of ~ 20 feet...and he then shot me dead!\nIf this had happened only once I would say, OK, I will just re-up and get another game going...But next game I had a sniper walk in front of me and I unloaded my SAW on him... he was not phased in the least but calmly ran up the stairs!!!\nAfter yelling at the game and getting angry I decided that I should at least let some folks out there know:\n\n  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!\n\nThe lag is beyond any I have ever seen. I am blaming it on STEAM because at least with COD4 MW1 I could find another server...With STEAM... you get steam. And you get lousy servers without recourse. Boy, is my face red!;Lag, LaG, LAG
24;149.0;1.0;8.0;So, where to start? My computer is custom made. I spend about $1900 on it. In short, it's pimped out. I purchased Modern Warfare 2 with every intention of wasting tons of time playing it. My plans were foiled when I discovered ERROR AFTER ERROR AFTER ERROR when trying to play this game! Literally 8 different errors that have required about 6 hours of my time, and now, like hundreds of other people on forums, I am stuck with the iw3mp.exe errors everytime I start the game. I can't play for more than 2 minutes without it crashing. This error has NOT been addressed by IW and there is no known fix.\n\nTHANKS FOR NOTHING!!!;So Many errors and no patches from IW yet

71;152.0;1.0;8.0;No dedicated server, short single player.  A major step backwards from the previous version for PC.  If you must have this game, buy it on console.

89;155.0;1.0;8.0;Originally I gave this game a good review, however, after a week of play I've changed opinion of it.  It is nothing like Modern Warfare 1.  Without a choice of servers you are forced into whatever group of players the game chooses.  As often as not, you will not connect anyway and if you do, there are frequent interruptions in play as it seeks a new host. Then there's predator strikes, helicopter strikes, air strikes, Pave-low strikes, AC-130 strikes and nuclear strikes, all of which keeps the play completely unbalanced. Personally, I find a simple first person shooter with some nice graphics and fewer goofy weapons more entertaining.;I was mistaken
90;156.0;1.0;8.0;I am a huge MW1 fan, i played the signle player campaign over and over and spent hours and hours playing online.\nBut that was MW1.\n\nNow MW is a disgrace to PC gaming everywhere.\nIt does not support PC at all.

92;157.0;1.0;8.0;All the reasons the PC version of their past games rocked has been stripped from this one. As other have mentioned... no dedicated servers, limited multiplayer, short rounds, etc, etc.\n\nWon't be buying future games from Infinity Ward at this rate.;PC Version no longer exists
95;158.0;1.0;8.0;Basically take all that PC gaming has been founded on and throw it out the window.  No mods, no servers, small player limit?  This is nothing more then a direct console port to the PC.  Supporting this game is only going to encourage companies to continue and try and get away with this BS.;What a joke.
97;159.0;1.0;8.0;"I was really looking forward to this game after the hundreds of hours spent on Modern Warfare 1. I played the MW1 demo and loved it and bought the game ASAP. While I can enjoy a good single player game, to be honest I never even finished the Single Player of MW1 because the multiplayer was too fun! So for me, the purchase of this game was going to be all about the multiplayer. I was initally dismayed when they recently announced (before release) that they would be making major changes to the multiplayer game (see numerous other reviews for details). Then I read that steam was required (another negative IMO). There seems to be no demo of this available(hmmm...suspicious). Then there were the videos of hacks already popping up one day after release, of course without the normal ability to kick/vote off cheaters due to the ""improvements"" of the MP. Considering all of this I decided that since the only thing companies seem to recognize is the bottom line, My only choice is to vote with my wallet and pass on this game to express my view on their business decisions. Who knows, maybe I'll pick it up when it hits the bargain bin, which may not be too far off since I just do not see this game having the longevity of the first.";Just another sequel failure
98;160.0;1.0;8.0;You'd think a major game developer would know that PC gamers buy first person shooters FOR the online play. The single player is just a nice bonus. Did Infinity Ward learn nothing from the utter failure that was Halo 2 PC and their 'matchmaking' instead of dedicated servers? Who thinks it's a good idea to be FORCED to play online games in a setting where the game is hosted on someone's friggin home computer???\n\nAnd what's funny is that no matter how slow their internet connection is, and no matter how crappy their PC is, they will be like GODS in games they host because they have 0 ping advantage. Every interview where you hear or read about an Infinity Ward representative talking about game 'balance' you should politely ask them to slap themselves.\n\nBottom line the online game play is so terrible that if you've ever played an FPS on PC before you'll feel nauseous that you spent $65 on this game. But please don't just take my word for it. Go on youtube and watch all the PC multiplayer videos and see the choppy laggy gameplay for yourself. You'll even see a few videos where one guy is owning everyone on the server with incredible shot accuracy. That's because HE'S THE HOST! Fun huh?\n\nThis game makes me want to crane kick someone in the face.;Prepare To Be Dissapointed!
102;161.0;1.0;8.0;"I suppose this review will sound more parroting what others have said so I'll try to at least differentiate it somewhat.\n\nFor starters I pre-ordered this from Amazon and I've already requested an RMA from them to return the game. That alone should give you an idea of what kind of game you're getting that literally is returned within 24 hours.\n\nI've played pretty much every Call of Duty that ever was released for the PC. Each iteration was a solid, polished number that always was a blast to play, and multiplayer was pretty much a high octane fragfrest that operated smoothly and with no glitches or problems. I've held up Infinity Ward along the likes of companies like Blizzard, Bioware and Valve for making top-notch games that sell well and are a great value as well.\n\nI initially balked at the 60$ pricetag, but I assumed they must be shoving in a whole lot of content to justify it. With the release date fast approaching and no word on what exactly we were doing with the PC version I got a little concerned but I figured we'd get our usual PR blitz detailing what kind of features were present on the PC. Then of course the news broke about the Dedicated Servers, but given IW's stellar track record, I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, even with the utterly ridiculous PR blahs they were issuing about how the PC version is so great. (""it has text chat and mouse aim!"" ""The game is not balanced for lean"" ""We feel the game is balanced for 100 ping and is playable"" Yes, they actually said those were ""features"")\n\nYesterday I got the game and played it like crazy trying to find that great feeling that I got from playing MW1 but I found that it pretty much was not there, and the glaring flaws with the game stuck out like sore thumbs and severely detracted from the experience.\n\nHaving now played the single player and tried the multi-player I've come to the conclusion that IW is more or less done with PCs in general. I attribute this to several points that I've noticed with the game itself and the attitude with which they've reacted with this whole mess:\n\n-The Price Tag - Perhaps my biggest sticking point. Charging 60$ for an even shorter single player campaign and REMOVING features from Multiplayer is perhaps my biggest beef with this game. I could understand if they included say Dev Tools, some special in-game weapon or even, as the dead horse writhes, dedicated servers, but there is none. Nothing. You get literally a straight console port whose only settings you can fiddle with is what kind of speaker set up you have and how high your resolution can go. That's it. That is not an improvement that is a sidegrade at best, and not even Hans Freaking Zimmer doing his voodoo he does so well can change that.\n\n-The Multiplayer - From a pure business perspective (Business Major Hooah!) I can understand what they're trying to accomplish with IWnet, I really do. They wish to (attempt to) clamp down on piracy and have a more direct say in the direction the modding and DLC is to go with the future of the game itself. Still, as a consumer, that really doesn't sit well with me. Having to downgrade my multiplayer experience (don't get my started on host migration as it is terrible and given the wait times I had to experience in just WAITING for a match to start is indicative of how people are already abandoning IWnet. Also ping is still a major issue. I run DSL and my ping never really stablized to the point that lag was not an issue.) with the next succession of the series definitely does not endear oneself in continuing to patronize the products IW offers. Also effectively killing off 3rd party MOD support and development with this change was another sore point in this matter as well.\n\n-The Attitude of IW - This I suppose is more subjective and small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, but I still feel it is relevant to the point about this whole debacle. Judging by the quality of the PC version of this game, it is obvious (to me at least) that IW does not wish to actively participate in the PC market any longer. The sheer lack of features, the higher price (for what bizarre reason I have yet to discover) and the substandard multiplayer has made it apparent that this was a straight console port through and through with no thought to what the PC players were interested in.\n\nNow let me be clear, I understand IW is a business and it is their prerogative to make money. If they feel that the PC platform is not something that they can support any longer than they should have come out and just said it. This whole ninja press release baloney and not revealing these details on just how gimped the PC version is until a month before release highlights the callousness that IW exhibits towards the PC gaming crowd and quite frankly I don't appreciate it. They are free to do what they do, but I would just appreciate in the future a bit more candor and up-front honesty in their dealings. You don't want to develop for the PC? Fine, make a press release and be on your way, don't try to sneak this in and then get all bent out of shape when we start screaming bloody murder about how badly handled this PC launch was.\n\nIn short, I would not recommend buying this game for the PC. The combination of high Price, lack of distinct features from the consoles and substandard multiplayer do not make it a viable option for the PC. Buy it for the console if you're jonesing for your MW fix, I suspect that is where we shall see the majority of their future efforts.";A big step down in the series, and a signal for the future.
104;162.0;1.0;8.0;This game is a total slap in the face for PC gamers. First they decided to get greedy and mark up the price by $10 over the typical PC new release. The only reason for this is just plain GREED. Next, they make PC gamers have to wait longer for the game than the console players. But the final insult is that they don't even support dedicated servers, something which the previous games have done and most multiplayer PC FPS titles do. Not only that, but then they limit the number of players to 9 vs 9 which is FAAAAARRRRR below what other PC FPS games support. Do not buy this game. It costs more than other PC games and has far fewer features. Wait for Battlefield Bad Company 2 instead.;Broken experience, higher price.
106;163.0;1.0;8.0;No dedicated servers for the PC version is a bad move from Activision and Infinity Ward, this is the first time I will not buy a Call of Duty game and from now on I won't buy anything from them.;Are u kiddin me????

I've boycotted all EA games for 3 years now.. and for a reason. Hello, Need for Speed anyone?\n\n$60 for PC is pretty ridiculous. No game on PC is EVER $60. The only reason its $60 on CONSOLES is because the console manufacturers get royalty's/cut $10 for licensing the product on their machine. PC is a free-for-all device! This is GREED people.\n\n No one 'owns' your PC! I'm a little shocked in awe that Steam/Valve even considered the activation method for exclusive usage despite the problems/clashes the 2 companies have had in the past... than again Valve is pumping out L4D2 as a supposed ""full game sequel"" when its really L4D1.5.\n\nManufacturers NET $40 profit on you more or less for every game they sell off after everything is said and done.. Now let them make $50, and let the retailer selling it to you make maybe ~$5.\n\n PC is where the technology is at. PC is what made Xbox... PS3...  PC users should not be condemned for being leaders of technology.\n\nIW - I hope your reading all these reviews... I bought your game for PC.. Very unfortunate of me. (Thanks Amazon for the $20 instant CODMW2 coupon I can spend on a game NOT made by Activision) -- Maybe next time I won't buy your game.. your arrogance and greed has diminished your worth as an industry leader and has permanently put you into the ""Packard Bell"" era.\n\nI feel like I HAVE to make this review.. because this is not right.. This game is driven by greed. Boss says ""charge $60 they'll buy it anyway"" ... Boss says ""remove these features, they'll buy it anyway -- but we won't officially disclose the information till its released"" -- Boss says ""oh and pay ign $500,000 to write a decent review"".

122;168.0;1.0;8.0;"I bought this game for the simple fact that I thought IWnet might have a chance at being good.\nIt isn't. It's no different from the way multi player is set up on the console version of Modern Warfare 1.\nYou get a list of game matches (I noticed old school is no longer available) and choose one.\nAfter searching for about 10 seconds (I won't lie, it does find a game pretty fast) you are thrust into a game lobby or game already in progress. The choice isn't yours, by the way.\n\nHowever, despite easily finding a game, the game I'm in usually is horribly laggy. Shot detection is bad and I often found my self turning a corner and shooting someone until my clip was out, only to find out ""my"" connection to the host had stopped for that brief few seconds. Then I am dead, watching the kill cam of my enemy killing me.\nThe addition of new weapons, kill streaks, perks, and attachments are all absolutely amazing, though Infinity Ward does have the modding community of Modern Warfare 1 to thank for most of those.\n\nThe single player portion of the game is just as amazing as the first Modern Warfare and that's about it.

123;169.0;1.0;8.0;Infinity Ward has completely destroyed what makes the PC a great platform for gaming in Modern Warfare 2.  This game not only costs an extra $10, but is actually missing more features than the original COD1 had.

10;172.0;5.0;7.0;I'm guessing the low average review score for this game is because of the pissed off MP community. Since I don't play MP much my review is for the single player aspect of the game. Everything from the graphics, gameplay, and story is purely top notch. Controls felt super smooth and refined. Some of the levels are so intense that sometimes it practically took my breath away. I played it at the normal difficulty which was a great balance between fun and challenge. The only negative for me was that it was a little short. I paid full price for the game and I feel like it was totally worth it. If your not into MP and play mostly SP campaigns than I would highly recommend this title to any FPS fan. It was action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Great job once again by Infinity Ward. What an amazing game.;Amazing Single Player Campaign...
20;173.0;2.0;7.0;I imagine that if you stumble upon my humble review of Modern Warfare 2, you must have already ready through 10+ one star reviews complaining about this game. It's probably rather superfluous of me to talk about this product given the amount of feedback that there is, but I still cant resist to throw in my own 2 cents. All the negative comments that you are seeing here about this game are all in fact true and substantiated. The campaign, while very interesting is extremely short and linear. The multiplayer lacks dedicated servers (by far the biggest problem) and does not allow more than 18 people to play simultaneously (also very annoying if you like me, prefer larger scale battles). There is a decent amount of lag while playing online and sometimes there is a long wait for players to join a game. Finally, there is no reason for a PC game to be costing $60, a $10 increase over the standard new release price.\n\nThe graphics improvements are pretty impressive, however the general gameplay remains largely unchanged, with riot gear being the one true innovation. Multiplayer maps seem to encourage a faster pace game over a more tactical and positional one that was more prevalent in Modern Warfare 1 and World at War.\n\nI am pretty much a 100% multiplayer FPS person, so despite the many shortcomings, there is still some fun to be had playing this game online. Basically, if you want a bit of a change of pace and a distraction from playing World at War and Modern Warfare 1 online and don't mind grossly overpaying, then get this product. If you expect to be impressed and totally hooked, then you are in for a major disappointment.\n\nSo to conclude, does it meet the expectations of this long anticipation? Absolutely not. Is it worth $60? Again, a resounding no. Is there a chance that Activision/Infinity Ward will do something to correct the multiplayer experience? Probably not, yet I am still a bit hopeful.\n\nThanks for reading.;All the complaints are substantiated
22;174.0;1.0;7.0;Its been echoed throughout these reviews, but DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME FOR THE PC.\n\nIt is a straight port from consoles to the PC, the matchmaking is horrendous and the infiltration of hacks and hackers is unreal.\n\nDo not waste your money on Modern Warefare 2, save it for Bad Company 2.;Stay Away and Tell Your Friends to Stay away

103;177.0;1.0;7.0;Congratulations IW, you've tricked me into buying your awful port of a game for PC. I was willing to forgive the lack of Dedicated Servers and Console Commands, but reducing gameplay to 9 vs 9 in multiplayer is absolutely awful. This game is in every way a downgrade of the the first Modern Warfare and I would not recommend it to any of my friends for purchase.;I was Tricked
113;178.0;1.0;7.0;I would like to echo the outrage that the PC community is feeling. These guys have ruined this game by taking away the dedicated servers and providing a short single player experience. Now PC users are limited to 9 vs 9 games hosted on one of the users PCs giving them an advantage. The game is just like the console version. Everything from the interface, you don't even get to see pings, just a cell phone like signal graph to the price being $60. They are probably going to charge for all the add on content too. The game has been out for a day and it is being reported that hacks are already available for the cheaters and with no dedicated server admins to bring down the ban hammer what will be done about it? I am thinking if you are looking for a war themed FPS you should wait and see what Battlefield Bad Company 2 shapes up to be like or check out the other alternatives.;PC Users Stay Away
136;179.0;1.0;7.0;As with COD4, this game has shipped with a few multi-player issues, the main being lack of dedicated servers. This is HUGE. Infinity Ward, understand one thing: you do not define the PC market. It defines you. We've been based off of Dedicated Servers for over 10 years, and nothing you can do will stop that. Step up your game, or give up. PC's are not consoles, and every PC gamer will tell you this. We don't want a console port. Give us a server browser with a 64 player limit and dedicated server support with mod support as well, then maybe, maybe I'll think about buying this game. Until then, wait and see what happens. While the game itself has great gameplay, a 6 hour campaign isn't worth $60.00. Neither is the broken multi-player.;Better wait and see.

4;182.0;1.0;6.0;I'll keep it short and sweet. I had high hopes for this game and solo play was pretty good.\nBut I mainly got it for online play. The serverless paradigm smells of someones PhD thesis.\nI've had this game for about 6 weeks now and have observed the following:\n1) Easy game to hack. I've played online games for quite a while now(I'm 50) and know how to spot a hack while spectating. I've seen lots of hackers since getting this game. VAC is so easy to cheat that people don't even try to hide it.\n2) Due to the serverless technology there are no admins to kick someone and they did not give us the ability to kick the hackers(see #1).\n3) Frequent server changes are needed. The game attempts to detect poor pings and switch users PC's that are being used to host the game. This happens frequently and sometimes fails and I'm kicked from the game.\n4) Due to the serverless technology you can't hang out with friends on servers. You have no control over what map you play on also.\n\nSummary: THey have taken the fun out of online play with this game. I'm selling mine and looking elsewhere.;If you want a game for Online play look elsewhere
12;183.0;1.0;6.0;Single player is pretty terrible.  I loved the first game, which is probably my favorite single player FPS I've played. This game was a horrible disappointment.  The airport level had little to no context what so ever, a three minute cut scene would have been better.  The other levels were for the most part a let down too.  The first hour or two was fun.  Rio was fun for awhile, but got repetitive quickly and by the end of the game that was my feeling for every level.  Looks fun at the beginning and could not wait to go to the next level because I was so bored by the random and horrible AI.  I started the game out on veteran, but moved it to easy about halfway through, just to finish the game because I could careless about the horrible story and AI.  Length is not an issue with me, since many games I play don't even have single player, but when it is a horrible 6 hour grind then it bothers me.  Spec-Ops is a nice addition, but there isn't much of a reason for them not adding co-op into single player and having those, fun, missions in it.  Multiplayer isn't much better than single player in my experience.  Since I don't live near a population center I have to deal with a great amount of lag all of the time, unlike any other multiplayer games where I can choose the servers closest to me, I have to sit and wait three minutes to find a game that is extremely laggy.  Other issues are the host changing, many hackers, all the guns for the most part act and sound exactly the same and pretty much shunted the PC gaming crowd.  I am disappointed by this Mediocre Warcrap.;A major disappointment.

14;185.0;1.0;6.0;Are you kidding me? This game is a joke. Nothing like cod4. YOU CANT EVEN CHOOSE WHAT MAP TO PLAY! Game is totally locked down on all levels. Multiplayer is a farce.

A shorter, less satisfying campaign and multi-player that is extremely disappointing. It is a shame that this game has been selling so well but Infinity Ward was counting on this. They knew they were making a game with less content and a larger price tag and could get away with it. You have to hand it to them, despite these problems. The game itself is quite addicting and enjoyable but slowly and surely this game is beginning frustrate the PC gaming community as a whole. Poor customer support. Rampant hacking. Rank exploitation. Dedicated server communities have been crippled. Host migration (Lag, Constant migration, poor host decision making, unable to find new hosts despite a plethora of users in the game) Public Relations representatives from IW have been ignoring the PC community and have been all buddy-buddy with the Xbox 360 and PS3 communities and that is the most frustrating part of all. These problems are really beginning to take their toll. So I implore you to hold off on buying this game and at the very least to wait until these problems have been fixed in the PC version.;A step down from MW1

Truly, there is a ""hack"" that removes the ping bars and replaces them with traditional millisecond ping displays and once in a server with a guy who was using the hack told me my ping was averaging around 250!!! and I had 3 ""green bars.""

21;189.0;1.0;6.0;"As has been said repeatedly, the single-player campaign is short (five hours on Hardened first time). The lack of leaning makes a few levels much more tedious than they need to be as you'll spend two hours of your play through rounding corners into a hail of gunfire. The gratuitous quick-time event with the mine was especially fun for me using a Nostromo - being told to ""Press X"" means a lot less to me than ""duck"". The difficulty overall seems to be tuned down from CoD4, with Hardened feeling more like Regular. If you play through on anything lower, don't bother firing a shot and just run to the next checkpoint, will get the time to complete down to two hours. Those gripes aside the single-player was as enjoyable as MW1.\n\nThe multiplayer is of course where it really nose dives. Claustrophobic maps, unbalanced weapons (full auto assault rifles as powerful and accurate as the single shots, why bother?), relatively short match durations, long intermissions between rounds; the list just goes on and on. Their idea of balance is apparently make it so holding down the Win button while rounding cramped corners gets as many kills as actually being able to aim on a more open map. The perk system is much better than CoD4 and the aesthetics of the weapons and attachments are more pleasing. Then there's the elephant in the room - the problems with the server set up aren't limited to lag, lack of customization, and small player counts. There's also no auto-balance, and you can't switch teams. So if you find yourself on the ugly end of a 2v6 scenario you better grab a riot shield and go hide in a corner.\n\nReally a shame, because it wants to be fun.";Save yourself $60

AI is garbage; seems the opposition is either an aimbot or a vegetable.  Even the graphics aren't particularly great.

31;192.0;1.0;6.0;"I am writing this review as a massive fan of COD 4 - Modern Warfare. Unfortunately, as stated by many other reviews here, Infinity Ward have seriously failed when it comes to the online experience in COD 6.\n\nReading all the posts prior to release it's easy to think that perhaps there were some overzealous ranting about the lack of dedicated servers. Having actually played this online I have to say that all of those ""rants"" were spot on. The online experience is very poor when compared to cod 4. For a start joining games with friends seems to hardly ever work. You create a ""party"", then try and join a server... sometimes you all get in, sometimes it just drops random players from the ""party"" and you have to start again. In addition, during play it often has to switch hosts because the hosting player has dropped out. Sometimes this works, other times it just fails and you are back in the lobby.\n\nAnother major problem is that on good dedicated servers with regular admins peoples behaviour is policed. Don't want to hear people hurling abuse at each other? Go find a good dedicated server which is policed and you're happy. Well in the short time I have been playing cod 6 I have seen several cases of abuse, bad language, racism etc. being hurled around. Now some people may not mind this but at least in cod 4 you had a choice. In taking the decision to bin dedicated server support Infinity Ward seem to have overlooked the advantages of having enthusiasts supporting and policing the online community around the game.\n\nI have heard all kinds of ideas as to why Infinity Ward took this decision, one being so they could charge for downloadable content IE: Map Packs etc. Perhaps this is true but I would have happily paid for extra maps if the online experience was any good. As it is I can't see me playing this online much at all.\n\nI could go on but you get the idea, essentially if you want to play online a lot you're probably better off looking elsewhere.\n\nThe single player is pretty good but as 99.999999% of my time in COD 4 was spent in the multiplayer and that was my plan with COD 6 the single player is of little consequence to me.\n\nInfinity Ward failed with this one.";FAIL
32;193.0;5.0;6.0;"I was very surprised how well this game came together. On a graphics side, it is one of the better ones I have seen. I am a multiplayer mode gamer, so I was nervous about some of the sudden changes that were made to the game. However, I am used to the steam style with L4D, so this game setup is working great for me and my LAN group. The single player mode is pretty decent, better than COD4, with much detail. I would rather play a single player that last 5 hours and kicks some major butt, than a endless, boring story line. The multiplayer maps are incredible, so many hiding places, rooftops, crawl spaces, etc, options are endless. The weapons are great with some very good ""care packages"" so I cannot complain. If you liked COD4, you should like this one too. There are some pretty harsh critics, which I feel are more based on the decisions made by ifw, but I personally know some harsh critics that have come to the realization that... it's not so bad! Get this game, or don't, up to you. I took a chance and am very pleased with the game play and it will keep me busy for a long time.";Much Better Than I Anticipated!
36;194.0;1.0;6.0;do i really need to detail it? it's been outlined in every other review up and down this page. until IW can get their act together and enable what their customers want, they will continue to receive bad reviews. i wonder what the programmers are thinking throughout all of this? poor guys, i bet they are probably equally appalled and they had to make the game!;you know why!
37;195.0;1.0;6.0;"First, Yes I do own this game, I bought it the day it came out.\n\nThe over game itself is fun and graphics are great. The game play suffers from the excessive commits from the game: Buzzkill, Avenger, Payback and all the other stupid things that pop up. There are way too many kill streaks that kill from the air, come on do we really need: Missiles, Helicopter and an AC130 gunship all at the same time.\n\nThe matchmaking system is horrible. It takes way to long to join a game. I am not kidding it takes about 5 min to join a game and the intermissions are way too long. There is no autobalance, you my start off on eventeams but since this game has a problem with dropping people to the lobby, you might be on a team 6 v 3. Also thaking about team size 6 v 6 sucks. What year is this 1980. You can play groundwar which is 9 v 9, but the lag is so bad most of the time; they should call lag war. I really dis like this game Left 4 Dead 2 comes out tonight so I will probley never play MW2 again.";Good game ruined by Matchmaking and achievements
42;196.0;1.0;6.0;Ok, you buy the game for $60, or maybe $50 on sale if you're lucky. Then you have to sign up for Steam. Which means, two companies now have full access to your hard drive. Item 9b of the Steam User Agreement says they accept no responsibility for any problems with your computer. That's right - you pay $60, then they make you install software that has a history of messing up computers, plus they can install spyware, keylogging, and anything else they - because you just game them permission to access your hard drive.\nWHY would you do this? Shame on Infity Ward and shame on Valve (makers of Steam).;STAY AWAY FROM THIS STINKER
44;197.0;3.0;6.0;I only play the SP, so as not to get too much wasted time, so that's all I can judge.\n\nPros:\n-Fast paced action in multiple locations\n-Good vehicle integration into the play\n-Music makes you amped up\n-Wild Story keeps you guessing what's next.\n-Awesome tech stuff(heartbeat meter, UAV use, guns, etc)\n-Difficulty is about right, on Normal I didn't have a frustrating experience\n-Interesting parts where you don't just shoot, like climb,run, etc.\n-Less dogs than the first one, man I don't like those things!\n\nCons\n-Too fast paced most of the time for me, this makes the already short SP campaign go by quickly.\n-Price is insane for what you get, especially if you are SP only.\nCompare this to other normally or even lower priced games, Borderlands, etc.\n-I just don't feel like the graphics are that much above the first one. I was shocked at how good they were in COD41, not so here. About the same.\n-This should have been an expansion pack, like COD used to do before they sold themselves to the console makers and got very greedy like Rockstar, etc.\n-Steam should offer SP only buying option, isn't Steam supposed to give us more choice, not less?\n-Due to Steam Resale is a real hassle, of course that's by design by greedy IW/Steam whatever they say about piracy.\n-Come on, in a war like that there will be no half-axxed warring, measures like worrying about some Ruski oil worker hostages(who are on a Ruski SAM rig), get real IW! PolCor humane warfare only makes war longer, not shorter and increases suffering, despite what the hippie-sters blather on about. Too much experience with them here I suppose.\n\nGood game, not worth the money. Why can't the Central Planners in Washington use some tax money to buy me a copy or bring the cost to me down like they seem to think they can do(won't happen with anything they try)? I didn't get anything from any of their other junk but a tax bill. Getting back to the game, I'd say to anyone who is sitting on the fence, wait for the price to come down and go for any of the other games coming out this fall. Not to say it's a waste but I don't see more than one more playthrough on campaign and then some single levels here and there. Remember this is for the SP only, read the other reviews for the MP part.;Single Player ONLY Review- Intense, Crazy Story, Too Fast
47;198.0;1.0;6.0;Now is the time for all good PC gaming heroes to come to the aid of their brothers (and sisters). What Infinity Ward has done with potentially one of the greatest games ever is totally unacceptable. The PC community deserves much, much more respect than the crap IW has delivered. Everyone knows the arguments about dedicated server and beyond, however the real argument is why? Why did they decide to ostracize the PC gaming community by adapting the console concepts? Why did they decide to rip the game apart and limit the functionality for MODing and all the other features we loved? Why are we now limited to small crappy maps when our rigs can handle much, much more? Why does IW continue to taunt the benefits when they know they ripped the hearts out of the people who truly loved the old game? WE AS PC GAMERS DESERVE TO MAKE CHOICES AND NOT BUYING THIS POS IS ONE OF THEM. Stand united my fellow gamers and lets not IW win this battle!\n\nPS Looks like left4Dead is my next pastime...;Not going to cross the line

They will sum up all of the specifics and details as to why this is a one star review.\n\nI'm an avid gamer from the days where Doom was shareware, showing my age now!  I've followed and bought all of the Id Software titles, Doom, Quake (suffered high pings over dial-up), etc.\n\nI have bought all of Infinity Wards COD games/series.  The ground breaking immersion of WWII and Modern warfare blew me away throughout the years.  So much that some form of COD has been 95% of my game time since '04.  Include tactical multiplayer games that are highly customizable and modded, what more could a gamer ask for?\n\nWell Infinity Ward and Activsion just slapped us PC gamers in the face, the very loyal people who helped make them and this series, who and what they are today!  They actually had the nerve to charge us more for less of a game.  It feels like we were tossed the scraps, ""...oh yeah, you PC gamers can have this hacked console left over and thanks for your $$$"".\n\nI'm usually very low key and never make waves or a stink but I can't let this one go.  This is actually only my second review here at Amazon, I think I'll send it along to IF and Activsion to boot.\n\nReally... I'm so irked I'll never buy another IF or Activision product again.  Heck I might even grow up and quit gaming all together rather than gettng ripped off like this.  At least I'll save money by not having to build and upgrade my rig to bleeding edge all the time, even though the building and tweaking are so fun!  Oh well, maybe now I can spend more time learning Windows 7 configurations and troubleshooting for my J O B.\n\nThat's too bad...even without a new 3D and physics engine (not sure if that is true or not but I've read that in several reviews), the graphics and game world immersion are quite remarkable.....at least with bleeding edge hardware all pumped up.";Infinity Ward and Activision sold us PC gamers out!
54;201.0;1.0;6.0;I play this game mostly for the multiple player game, which I enjoyed a lot for the modern warfare. But this version, which I cannot even choose my own map and the number of players. I cannot even believe it that I cannot choose these most basic settings. Feel like playing modern warfare version .5 instead of version 2. Please get us the delicated server back or won't buy game from activision anymore. Actually nevermind, I want my money back.;Multiple player game is very limited
55;202.0;1.0;6.0;The game is horrible: bad DirectX 9 console graphics (by 2009 standards), the world appears totally unreal. Everything is pre-scripted, no freedom at all. It's a terrible console port that does not deserve any of the publicity it is getting. YOU CANNOT EVEN SELL YOUR COPY of the game after it has been activated (via Steam). It is a ripoff and I wonder when the first people sue Activision/Steam for not being able to sell this bad piece of software.;Do not discard the criticism: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, you will be disappointed.
61;203.0;1.0;6.0;I bought this game (PC Version) in ignorance of all the recent changes as explained by others here.  I've never written a review before but was so disappointed that I decided to come and do it.  I was shocked at the number of negative reviews here considering the amount of hype the game received, but I can assure you folks, the reviews are WELL DESERVED.  Do yourself a favor and stick with COD4 and other multiplayer games like Team Fortress 2.  We need to send a message to developers that the BS they are pulling on PC gamers will not be tolerated.  I have mine on auction with a buy it now of $35 if anyone really wants it..though honestly I don't think it's worth more than $10.  Get your FPS fix elsewhere and stay away from this.;It's going on Ebay
64;204.0;1.0;6.0;I'd give it zero stars if I could. Very disappointing. The ultimate example of a company not listening to their customers.\n\nVote with your wallet! If you are new to the series, try the excellent Call of Duty (1), United Offensive, or Call of Duty 2, which although older, are still plenty of fun, cheap, and do not suffer from the many limitations imposed by the authors of Modern Warfare 2.;I'd give it zero stars if I could
66;205.0;1.0;6.0;Infinity Ward and Activision pretty much butchered this enhanced version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare by removing all the good things that made its predecessor awesome (Yes, I own CoD4 and like it) such as modding support (new maps and other custom content) and the ability to run a dedicated server.\n\nWith the lack of those two vital features, the game is basically in IW's grip on what and when they will add new content and will have a much lower replay value that will eventually cause the game to be forgotten within 6 months tops.\n\nStick with CoD4: MW if you want action packed, cooperative and (mostly)realistic team play as it supports third party maps/mods AND the ability to run your own server, among other things like up to 32 players (MW has a max of 18 player limit IIRC).\n\nIn all, avoid this game at all costs and play Call of Duty 4 instead.;Butchered
75;206.0;1.0;6.0;This game had so much potential, and so far, has delivered on it poorly.\n\nI hate the lack of dedicated servers, and the obvious porting from the console, and the absence of leaning, and no more hardcore mode, and a number of other things. They took a lot of what made the first game good, and they threw it out.\n\nWhat really bothers me, is that the game doesn't even work right now. I spent 45 minutes installing it through Steam (which is a problem in itself). It took so long because the default installation process does not work until Steam activates the game (which will take place on 11/13/09 I think). I then played the game for about an hour, having a hard time deciding whether I was enjoying myself or not, given all the pros and cons. Luckily I have had a lot of time to think about this topic, because the game is still not working after over an hour of trouble shooting. It just stopped working, and so far has not come back. I have tried a number of proposed solutions, and so far nothing.\n\nBottom Line: It may be fun if it works, but in many ways it is a step backwards, if not an insult to PC gamers.;Buggy and Backwards
82;207.0;3.0;6.0;"Okay, I'm going to go ahead and say that I don't agree with the direction IW took with the multiplayer.  That stinks and I love the multiplayer in all of the previous Call of Duty games.  That being said, I don't think that just because of that the game deserves only 1 star.  The single player is very entertaining.  It's quite a bit more dramatic than the first modern warfare game but still fun.  The Spec Ops mode is a complete BLAST!  I think that the spec ops mode is what saved this game for me.  Get a friend and take off into the numerous challenges.\nNow before you start berating me because I don't see eye to eye with your opinion, I do think the multiplayer is a crappy deal.  Yes, it would be much better if they offered the dedicated servers and all that other stuff that was in the first modern warfare.  I logged tons of hours in the previous call of duty multiplayer games.  Change sucks but how many different call of duty multiplayers do you need?  On my count you can still play dedicated servers for:\nCall of Duty\nCall of Duty: United Offensive\nCall of Duty 2\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\nCall of Duty: World at War\n\nI love all of those games for both the single player AND the multiplayer.  But, for me, when it comes to the Call of Duty games I put a bigger emphasis on single player than I do multiplayer.\n\nI'm not looking to say that anyone is right or wrong in their OPINIONS but rather giving my honest and hopefully helpful opinion.\n\nPros:\nVery entertaining single player\nExtremely entertaining Spec Ops mode\nTons of steam achievements to try and obtain\nPretty good graphics (not the best I have ever seen)\nGreat way to hold me over until Left 4 Dead 2 is released!\n\nCons:\nNo Dedicated Multiplayer\nRelatively short single player\nFriendly AI could be a little more ""intelligent""\nHigh price for small replay value (multiplayer issues)\n\nIt is what it is people.  They had the goal to make this game geared more towards the console crowd.  That is hard to take being a PC gamer but how is this any different than any other game that is made specifically for consoles?  Grand Theft Auto can be purchased for the pc but do you think they aimed it towards the PC crowd?";It is what it is...
85;208.0;1.0;6.0;This game is utter nonsense. It's a complete downgrade from every aspect compared to COD4MW except for graphics.

You have to be a real tool to buy this game for 59.99.

Single player is just one bad john woo movie with over done explosions and 0 character development. No offense the level where you massacre innocent civilians is downright creepy, i understand they want us to get ""into"" the game but thats really pushing it to far for my tastes. This game failes to capture my attention with the horrible hollywood d movie dialog, predictable action sequences (no change from the first modern warfare) an allegedly improoved match making system..and No dedicated server support. And they want 60 dollars?! Let me guess if this game tanks they will blame pirating online, real life pirating on the high seas and maybe global warming. Stay away from this game, please spend your money elsewhere, I would very highly recommend Arma 2 (even with all its bugs and learning curve at least the game tries to be entertaining) Battlefield Bad Company and or any other FPS then this game.

I do not know why they dropped the Call of Duty"" from their name, but that is only a small mistake in a series of blunders made by publisher Infinity Ward.  I'll try to be objective about actual gameplay and start with the positives first:\n\nSingle Player:\nModern Warfare 2 (MW2) single player gameplay is absolutely amazing.  It is the most immersive single player experience I have had from an FPS since I first started playing them in 1993. Anyone who has played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-4-Modern-Warfare/dp/B000TTFLS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>&nbsp;will understand what I mean by ""immersive,"" and you can learn to expect more of the same with MW2. This is the closest I've come to feeling like I was actually in the military and it is what every other FPS with a single player aspect should strive for.  The story takes place following the events in Modern Warfare, as you take on the characters of Sergeant Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson and James Ramirez.  Gameplay has some great environments, including Brazil, Rio De Janeiro, and some decent urban environments.  Until you get to the American missions, the urban gameplay environments closely resembles what you find in Modern Warfare, with the exception of an airport mission that calls for some quick thinking.  One of the real standouts however is a snowy mountain, that many people have seen from the trailer.  If you've seen the trailer, you will know that there it ends with a scene that calls for a ""leap of faith"" of sorts.  I played the first time through on veteran and tried to really pretend I was within the game, meaning I took every precaution a real soldier would take not to die.  This heightened the experience for me, nowhere as much as this mission where you have to make that jump.  Without spoiling anything, I can only say that my heart was literally racing during this mission.  I strongly suggest that everyone consider playing the first time on veteran mode, which forces you to be (a lot) more careful and take your time.  This is even more important given that single player mode is over just as quickly as it was in Modern Warfare.  You're looking at an average of maybe 8 hours of gameplay.  I am not a very good player and it took me 15 on veteran.  If you lower the difficulty rating, it will be easier, but the game will be over before you know it.  There are enough save points where I think most players will be able to handle veteran without too much frustration.\n\nDisclosure: I have not actually played multiplayer through Infinity Ward's service, but don't feel that I need to to be able to comment and provide the below opinion.\n\nMultiplayer:\nUgh.  Here is where the fun ends.  Bottomline: this game is a port from the console version.  I realize that Infinity Ward probably gets more sales from consoles than a PC version, and I also realize they lose sales on piracy, but this was NOT the way to handle this release.\n\nTHERE IS NO DEDICATED SERVER SUPPORT IN MODERN WARFARE 2!\n\nYes, you read that right. In an effort to combat software piracy, and more likely, due to general laziness, you can only play multiplayer on peer to peer through their Infinity Ward web site.  There is no console.  That means no player servers, no customization, and no mods.  IW said their reasoning for this is ""we would like you to play the game the way we designed and balanced it.""  So they only want you to play by THEIR rules. Why do they CARE if players want to change the rules and add custom weapons or maps?  How does it possibly affect them in any way?  I'll tell you how, it causes them to put more work into the PC version instead of just porting it.  The max amount of players per map is 9v9, so forget about having large clan matches. They also removed the lean ability from the PC version, claiming that it affects game balance. WHAT?!  Is this game supposed to be realistic or not?  So now I have to jump out from behind a building because leaning around it gives me too much of an advantage?  IW's response about whether the PC version is a port or not, was that it is not a port, because it has custom features like ""mouse support and graphic settings."" WOW, I can change the resolution and use a mouse!  I was planning on buying an Xbox controller and jamming it into my USB port, but I guess I won't have to with these custom mouse features!  IW has confirmed that average ping times of 100ms are acceptable (expect the peer host to have a significant advantage, regardless of what they say), and that there is no way to kick cheating players because IW's flawless system will ban all cheaters.\n\nBelow is a comparison chart of the PC features between MW and MW2 (I did not originally compile this list)\n\n........................................MW....................MW2\nNetworking architecture..........Client/Server.........Peer2Peer\nAverage ping.....................10-40ms...............100ms+\nConsole commands.................Yes...................No\nLean.............................Yes...................No\nCustom maps......................Yes...................No\nNumber of players................Up to 64..............Up to 18\nCompetitive mods.................Yes...................No\nMod tool.........................Yes...................No\nAbility to record................Yes...................No\nAbility to ban hackers...........Yes...................No\nProfiles saved online............No....................Yes (the ONLY advantage MW2 has over MW)\nISP/Clan hosted servers..........Yes...................No\nBad language filtering...........Yes...................No\n0 ping advantage for host........No....................Yes (better hope he's on your team)\nLAN play.........................Yes...................No\nFree demo........................Yes...................No\nFree downloadable content........Yes...................No - you have to pay for it\nRequires patch to play online....No....................Yes\n\nI understand companies need to protect their intellectual property, but getting rid of dedicated servers in a misguided attempt to curb software piracy is a huge mistake.  People WILL pirate the game. I am not aware of any game that has not been cracked by software pirates. The only people Infinity Ward is hurting with this release are legitimate PC owners, the same people who made the original Call of Duty so successful. Do not be fooled into thinking this is anything other than a direct port of the console versions. I do not want to deter people from playing this on Xbox and PS3 though, so my review pertains only to the PC version. As a consumer, you need to decide if the price of this game is worth an amazing 10 hour single player experience.";A game with amazing potential which is lost on this PC PORT

They advertise their console-crack-smoking game-finder crap as the end-all be-all of anti-cheat.  HAH!  As a private, I'm constantly pushed to games dominated on one side by generals, while the other is all lower-ranked enlisted.  WOW! FAIR GAME!  Add to that the constant server-glitches, hackers, and cheats that supposedly ""Don't Exist"" on IWN - BAH!\n\nAdd to that the constant spawn-pwnage and sniping.

11;221.0;1.0;5.0;I bought this game for PC, when already owning the PS3 version, so I could play with some friends online. There are way too many hackers online in the PC version. I didn't mind the no dedicated servers, but this totally ruins online multiplayer. Valve Anit-Cheat does absolutely nothing. I also hate that this is the only PC game that came out at $60 and they clearly didn't put in dedicated server support so they could better sell DLC.

16;222.0;1.0;5.0;Let's start off with the nice $59.99 price tag. PC games are $49.99 tops. This game is $59.99. They knew it would suck, so they charge the fans of the series more.

An utter disgrace to the company. Will never in my life purchase a game in the CoD series, and will carefully scrutinize every single game released by Activision before buying. (Probably never)\n\nAnd I thought VALVe was being lame with L4D2 a year after L4D1. This game makes L4D2 look like a great buy.;"Dissapointment; worse in the series"
17;223.0;1.0;5.0;"WARNING: The following review is written by a total combat gaming snob who demands the best in online gameplay.\n\nHey, ripped-off Call Of Duty fans: Let's do a little comparison between ""Joint Operations: Combined Arms"" (specicially the ""Combined Arms"" version) and COD (any version), shall we?\n\nWhat's the point of having a sniper rifle if the enemy is always so close to you that you can just throw a grenade (or a rock)?  Such is the laughable world of COD and its sardine can maps. In Joint Ops, the maps have no borders - you can fly, ride, drive or run forever in any direction. You can hike up a mountain side and rain down some death with a sniper rifle from over 1,000 away like a real sniper actually can. That's 10 football fields end-to-end!  But if COD is all you play, you have no clue what this is like. You probably think snipers shoot their targets from just across the street. In COD, that's all the CAN do.\n\nHow about the ability to have up to 200 players online in the same map in all out full-scale warfare? Oh, that's right - COD maxes out at 64. But then again, those sardine can maps only allow for that many. Get's a little crowded in there, doesn't it?\n\nTanks? APCs? Aircraft? Jeeps? Mounted guns (and even missiles) on all vehicles and aircraft? Dirt bikes? Yup - Joint Operations has them all, 100% pure user-controllable. COD? Nowhere to be found. Sorry, you're on foot, you brainless grunt.  Snore.\n\nAnd for all you vehicle haters and ""knife and pistol only"" screweballs - you can totalyl exclude any vehicles or weapons in Joint Ops if you want to.  Total flexibility.\n\nWeather: In Joint Ops, you can even control the weather and time of day.  Want to fight at night in the rain with nightvision?  No problem.  Air quality and haze factor?  Make it slightly hazy, totally foggy or crystal clear, and to any degree.  It's all up to you.\n\nParachuting out of a helo? And while your buddies cover you by manning the two miniguns? Yup, JO's got that too. Joint Operations is all about combat realism. But this is nowhere to be found in COD.\n\nArmored vehicles like tanks and APCS, all different types, too, and you get to choose, drive and fully man them - Joint Ops is where its at. Nowhere to be found in COD, other than immovable ""eye candy"" objects to hide behind while your enemies ""prairie dog"" you from the next mountainside over. Oh, wait, that would be Joint Ops. In COD, your enemies will be ""prairie dogging"" you from across the street because of the laughably claustrophobic maps.\n\nCalling your own artillery strikes by operating, aiming and firing the artillery yourself - Joint Ops has it. Nowhere to be found in COD. Matter of fact, you can't even call in artillery until you make a certain rank. Sucks to be you.\n\nHand-carry guided missles like Stingers and Javelins to use against enemy aircract and armored vehicles? Only in Joint Ops. You have absolutely no idea how deeply satisfying these weapons are to use, I cannot stress this enough. This apsect of the game lone is indescribably thrilling. In COD, you only get a taste of this, and only in single-player mode. Imagine enjoying this in multi-player agaist all enemy vehicles. Stop drooling, you look like an idiot.\n\nSick of playing COD and only being able to experience cool things in single-player mode, only to discover that none of it exists in multi-player mode? Don't you feel ripped off? You should, especialyl since it's all the single-plyer stuff that Infinity Ward slaps on the package to sell it. Sick of playing ""dumbed down"" jousting matches of endless, boring ""run and gun"" because the developers have you locked into tiny little sardine can maps that don't allow for aircraft and vehicles? You should be. With games like Joint Operations and Battlefield 2 being out for years, there is no excuse for these pathetic limitations and missing elements of true combat and warfare.\n\nMap size, huge issue: imagine jumping on a dirt bike and going off into the distance and going ""Evel Knievel"" by jumping over hills for a while? You can do that in Joint Ops. COD? Not even. In COD, you can't even walk in any direction for more than a minute before bumping into a very unrelaistic map limit barrier. Gee, that's realistic, isn't it? If Infinity Ward wanted to go for all out realism, they should make your voice echo like you're running around inside a gymnasium - because you are. Whatta joke. If you think this is how gaming is supposed to be in a multi-processor, SLI-graphics world, then you've been smoking breakfast.\n\nRank and Weapons: Every map starts out with everyone at the same ground level in rank. No ""old guard"" elitist jerks with superior abilities and weapons to spoil the game. Every weapon available in Joint Operations is available to you during gameplay. Change roles and weapons as you see fit and unleash absolute hell from the very beginning of every map. Oh, that's right, you play COD or BF2, and you can't do that because you have to make a certain rank before you're allowed to touch certain weapons, commands and features. You actually paid for that game? Drank the CoolAid, didn't you?\n\nThough there are not nearly as many servers to jump on compared to COD, the gameplay alone is worth it. 1,000 servers of COD is still COD - it just ain't Joint Operations.\n\nCome play Joint Operations Combined Arms (make sure it is the ""Combined Arms"" verrsion), the game that STILL makes all versions of COD and Battlefield look like a joke. The graphics aren't as good, but still worthy of praise and a small price to pay for utterly amazing - and unparellelled - gameplay and features. You will not find another game that will allow you to do what you can do in this game. Not by a LONGSHOT. Speaking of longshots, Joint Operations allows artillery, tank, sniper and all other weapons fire at ranges 1,000 yards plus, often actually disappearing back into the haze of the atmosphere. You actually NEED scopes and binoculars in Joint Ops. Imagine that!\n\nNova Logic got this one right, and in a HUGE way. Nobody else has touched it since, including Nova Logic.\n\nCome see what you've been missing. If you're going to be addicted to a PC game, this is the one.";"COD Still a Joke Compared to ""Joint Operations"""
27;224.0;1.0;5.0;bought the game.  installed fine, thankfully. played single player and some multiplayer (get into that later). all was good. Halfway through a snow sniper mission... directx failure crash. ok, look up fixes do them all, directx already updated as is everything else. Game had been working fine for a long time already with no problems. Start up the game again, crashes even faster. My multiplayer was still working, just not single player. I try it again, game crashes on load up. doesn't even get passed the splash screen. Try multiplayer, same thing. game completely unplayable.\n\nohk, now about the multiplayer. no dedicated servers, which means. you cant get to know anybody online as you will never see them again, therefore there is more cussing and foul language by the users than are found on dedicated servers. also, the lack of the kick/ban and admins mean that hackers run free. which is super annoying if they can throw up uavs before the first kill has been taken. The lag is a pain. There is no way to choose what map you want, and so you end up playing the same 4 over and over. The host leaves and the game fails to migrate so you're kicked out, only to start back on the first map you played. Hardcore mode is now more a pain than fun as there is a wait time before you can spawn again. the wait time between maps is wayyyyyy too long. you wait a minute for the intermission. then 10 more secs while the match starts. then the map loads, where you then wait for all the players. then the match starts and takes another 6 seconds to actually let you move. The reason I don't play fps on console is for these reasons.... great job.\n\noh. and I thought one of the excuses they used matchmaking on the PC was to balance the gamers out. But that doesn't work as I am always placed with the best players and we completely destroy the other team. Also, if we have to put up with matchmaking, why doesn't PC have leaderboards like the xbox does? also, there is no autobalance like on dedicated servers, which means if your team backs out mid game, your screwed, it will be 6v2 for the rest of the map.\n\ninfinite ward is full of idiots that know nothing about real gaming.;Stopped working...
28;225.0;1.0;5.0;only takes about six hours to complete the whole game. networking is rather disappointing. we deserve more than that for [...] bucks.;shortest game ever
30;226.0;1.0;5.0;Trying to best Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2 falls well short. A very short single player experience paired with the crippled multiplayer makes this just another average PC first person shooter and nothing more.;Does not live up to predecessor.
33;227.0;3.0;5.0;"This review addresses PC online multiplayer issues ONLY.\n\nThis is no COD Modern Warfare in terms on online playability.\n\nYes I bought it and yes I have played it a lot.\n\nIncorporating the console method of multiplayer matchmaking on the most anticipated online FPS of the year is just pathetic.\n\nIt will be the last Infinity Ward game I ever purchase.\n\nThe phrase ""Less for More"" applies here.\n\nI'm lucky I can even play it on my DSL 1.5 connection.\n\nOnline matches just abruptly end and migration to another host is horrible at best.\n\nIt's still worth purchasing if you loved COD MW multiplayer, but it is 2 steps back for the franchise and that is both unacceptable and reprehensible.\n\nThe game itself is fine (graphics, & sound).  It's just the Steam based interface that has to go!";It's Craptastic, It's STEAM!
35;228.0;5.0;5.0;Okay let me start with introducing myself. I am a hardcore gamer from like 2001, and I am hardcore FPS fan.\nI played the first Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and LOVED IT!!\n\nIf you loved the first one, then you have NO IDEA how good the second story is. I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHERS SAY. This is one fps game you CANNOT miss. The graphics is EVEN better than the first one and I mean SUBSTANTIALLY.\n\nNow about the controversial multiplayer part. Is it good, yes it is, if you like XBOX 360/PS3 multiplayer format. This is great I have no complains. But you must get this game for the story, it is just TOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!! And I do not think you will complain about the multiplayer section.\n\nOverall 5 star!;YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE
38;229.0;5.0;5.0;"I am writing to praise this game....I am new to the COD movement and did not have the priveledge of playing the first one.  (On a side note, I am a professional dj who rarely has time to play these games, but occasionally there will be one to come along you just HAVE to try...this is one of those games)\n\nDuring the lengthy time (almost 45 minutes to an hour) it took to do a complete install, all that kept going through my mind was, ""please let it be worth the $65 I just plunked down at Game Stop.""  Once the game started, (you have to go through the whole ""STEAM"" annoyance...which I knew about from Left 4 Dead) you're good to go.\n\nThe graphics will have you in awe.  It's like one of those movies so heavy in detail you'd have to watch it several times to assure yourself you've just seen what came into view.  You'll spot something new just about every play.  The action is somewhat scripted, which I don't mind, but I've always been a ""stray from the beaten path & explore"" type of guy.  That's one downside.  There's the controls (which the quick tutorial takes you through, so you won't look like a complete j*ck*ss on the field) which take a bit of learning but once you do this it's nearly a free for all.\n\nSomething I particularily enjoy is approaching new vehicles/actions (climbing, mounting guns in the cars, etc) which totally gives a new experience to those in the hot seat.  I honestly don't get bored with this (better not, for the $$ they're charging) in single player campaign. But, then again, I've never cared to do the multi player version.  Playing vs A.I. is perfect for me....\n\nThings that have seriously stuck out in my experience so far that I will share:  SNOW. I looked down at my boots and damn if I couldn't make out POWDER detail in it.  Kudos to the programmers!!  I was almost submerged in this environment and they managed to capture it perfectly.  Next--THE SNOWMOBILE.  Remember the Biker Scout bikes in Return Of The Jedi movie?  Dodging trees....etc??  Well, get ready to relive it.  Don't have a beer before playing it or it will seriously rock your vertigo senses.\n\nOn a side note, please remember where you are when you're playing this game.  I sat down to play just 15 minutes worth of action before I took in for the night.  When I looked up at the clock an hour had passed.  It's that enjoyable and easy to loose track of your life.  (Now I realise what the World Of Warcraft peeps go through! lol)\n\nLast, before I made the choice to get this, I read (religiously at that) the reviews for this game.  I took everything into account before I bought it.  In hindsight it looks as if the multiplayers and those who want customization options (map building, etc) are affected the most.  This doesn't concern me.  I like single player.  Call me the odd one....  and as for not having the option to ""LEAN"" in the game, please.  It's like eating beans and getting upset because you can't rip the loudest f*rt afterwards. Enjoy the taste because you're getting a good, healthy fiber! lol\n\nPlay on.......";Newbie to COD MW franchise...
40;230.0;1.0;5.0;Bought it. Regret it because of all the changes from MW1.

41;231.0;1.0;5.0;"This game is nothing but a good way to steal your money.... First, you get two discs to enter into your computer which do not contain the program you purchased. You are forced into signing on to (Steam/Valve) in order to activate the download, which by the way comes from their servers. If you have dial-up internet connection, look for at least 10 to 11 hours to try and complete the download. If your lucky and do not lose the connection, you may be able to play the game. I purchased this game on the 14th and still have not been able to complete the download. ActiVision/Infinityward use to be very reliable programs. But since teaming up and giving all control to Steam/Valve they are at and all time low.

46;233.0;1.0;5.0;Originally, I was going to buy 2 copies of this game for PC, one for me and one for my son since we play online together all the time.  After reading all the negative reviews, I've decided to borrow it from a friend and try it first.  I ended up finishing the sp game in a just few hours (kinda boring.  The multi-player part of the game is just horrible compared to 4 and 5.  That is too bad for Inifiniti-Ward.  Perhaps losing 2 copies of this game isn't a big deal but they can really add up. They have really ruined it for the PC with all the negative points stated in other posts.  I guess I will go back to COD4&5 for the multi-player action that kept me playing for months.  What a disappointment!  I cannot believe I actually waited for this game.  IW and Activition, stop blaming on the piracy and get your crap together.  People will buy when the game is worth buying.  I sure hope you learn your lesson!  Anyway, love the Nazi Zombies and dedicated servers!!!;Don't bother...
50;234.0;5.0;5.0;You can read all you want about the game from all the others. However don't listen to all the negative reviews. PC users are upset and some have formed a flash mob. They are upset because of the lack of a dedicated server. This game is the same game (only with better graphics, depending on your PC, that is...)as the Xbox or PS3 game and those are getting rave reviews. Perhaps because of the flash mob this game will come out with a fix for the dedicated server (fingers crossed), but it still rates 5 stars, especially when you compare this game to all else that's out there.;Don't listen to the flash mob!

I came here, logged into my Amazon account with 1-Click Ordering enabled, ready to buy the PC version of this game. After reading these reviews, I won't be doing so.

58;238.0;1.0;5.0;CoD started on the PC and the only reason they are popular is because of PC gamers. Now they are screwing over the PC gamers and charging $10 more for a game just because they are greedy. They have taken out all of the features that would make this a true PC game, it is now simply a left over 360 port.\n\nThere are way better games out there to spend your money on, and way better developers to support. Developers who care about the future of PC gaming, and who will make PC gaming better, not dumb it down to console levels.\n\nIf people purchase this game, they will only be encouraging other developers to try and get away with the same things that IW is trying to do.

62;240.0;1.0;5.0;I have to say this is the most rediculous thing I've ever heard of. I just received my copy of CoD Modern Warfare 2. I have been looking forward to playing this game despite most of the complaints about Multiplayer. I go to install the game only to find out I HAVE to have a Steam Account AND I have to wait 26 hours for it to activate before I can play the game. Are You Kidding Me??\nI'm sorry Infinity Ward but that is just too much. You have just turned me from one of your fans, to someone who will never buy another product from you.;26 hours before I can play?
86;241.0;1.0;5.0;If you have a console buy the game for that. The single player is well done but far too short. I beat it in five hours on my first playthrough. The multiplayer is good on the console version but not worth it on the PC one. By moving away from dedicated servers they have destroyed what makes PC games better than their console counterparts. There are already hackers and there is nothing you can do about it until Infinity Ward gets around to banning them, you can't mod, and you can only play in up to 18 player matches instead of the 64 in the first game. The multiplayer in this game was a massive step backwards, it is basically a console game that you can play on your computer, it in no way takes advantage of the benefits PC has over consoles. The original game was better than this so you are better off sticking with that until Bad Company 2 comes out.;Don't buy for PC
87;242.0;1.0;5.0;I purchased this game hoping it would be a successor to earlier versions. However, the campaign was quite short and the multi-player is so ill equipped it made for no replay value. If you get in a game, it's usually very laggy, you jerk around the screen. If you manage to get a host, you can't really kill him much or he'll just quit, then  you're back to square one finding a new game. Infinity Ward forgot to make anti-cheat protection and there's rampant 'wall hacking' and 'aimbotting' going around. It's not worth it. I would suggest trying Modern Warfare 1, it's of higher quality than this.;Poor planning, short story, no replay value here.

I bought the game not knowing about this important change, and I wish I had not.  If I could sell it, I would, but since it is forever locked to my steam account, I can't.  IW may say that they're trying to improve the game with these changes, but I think their motives are obvious - Anti-piracy and sellable downloadable content concern have ruined what should have been the best game of the year.;No dedicated servers = No Fun!
111;246.0;1.0;5.0;All it is is a bad port of the console version, don't bother buying it. With no dedicated servers all you get is lag.;TERRIBLE
155;247.0;1.0;5.0;The features of the PC version of Modern Warfare 2:\n\n-Mouse control\n-Text chat in-game\n-Graphics settings\n\nWe're missing a few things here.;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
157;248.0;3.0;5.0;Well I can honestly say that I played the multiplayer for about 6 hours or so and then we did some 4 man private DM and all without much of a hitch. I love this game, yeah it kind of sucks that its basically a console port but aside that difference its a solid game.\n\nI got great frame rates, on average I never lagged and my year old video card held strong and wasn't a problem with the graphic settings at a fairly high level.\n\nMy only gripe besides the fact that its a console port but its done very well, is the POS Steam engine, that seamed to cause us the most problems for most of the night, but thats not Infinity Wards problem.\n\nAnother thing I noticed, if there was a person with a bad ping, it would normally kick them and would try to keep everyone with good ping.\n\nAll in all I don't think this game is as bad as people said it would be, especially since most of those haters havnt even bought the game and are just assuming. I recommend this game to anyone, at least try it, its really not that bad, if you want to play in a clan, setup your own private server!  If your a hardcore clan player with more then 9 players this might not be for you, but for the average gamer this game is all about having fun and just shooting people in the face!\n\nI give this 3/5 stars overall because of the backstabbing from Activision, you all know the issues, but aside those differences this is a very fun game to play.;Great Console Port
220;249.0;1.0;5.0;I really thought this would be better than the first modern warfare. WRONG!!\nIt might be OK on the xbox and PS3 but the pc version is awful.\n\nThe steam activation is also aggravating to say the least, if your internet connection goes down, then you can't play the game at all. Because everytime you start the game, it has to check with steam. If it can't make the connection? Poof! it closes down.\n\nThe single player game is fun but very short and not very challenging. I finished the entire single player campaign in just over 3 hours. What makes it worse is that I think the AI got dumbed down in this version.\n\nWasted 60 bucks.\n\nThis game is so OVER RATED in the gaming mags.;Not what I was expecting.
236;250.0;1.0;5.0;"And so it comes to this: Infinity Ward, once beloved of the people, releases a console port for their fourth game in the Call of Duty series. I for one never thought this day would really come, but I suppose the lack of any response to the PC community's numerous complaints proves that it has.\n\nHow did this happen? How did the company that brought us experiences like storming Stalingrad and North Africa on our desktops develop a game that doesn't even have support for lean (it's not balanced, or so I've heard.) How did the company that released Modern Warfare, which was a fantastic competitive multiplayer experience, develop a game that doesn't even support dedicated servers, something Half-Life DM did in 1999? How can they look in the mirror and say going from 64-players on a server with no lag to 18 with around 100ms response time is progress?\n\nSigh.\n\nAnd to think I won a video card and new monitor playing CoD4 in a local competitive LAN match. I guess such days are gone, at least for this series.\n\nThe hardest pill to swallow is that we all know the game would be awesome if not for the hack-job that's been done to the PC version. It will probably be the best-selling game of all time, and I'm sure millions of casual/console kids will proclaim it the ""best game ever,"" although most of us know that's not true (sorry, you simply can't dethrone the original Half-Life with a shoddy port). While I personally never really cared for the storyline of CoD4, even the singleplayer of this game looks pretty fun (albeit short).\n\nIt's hard not to be somewhat depressed if you're an enthusiast PC gamer today.\n\n I'm not nave: I understand consoles are where the money is currently. I understand with IW.net Activision will be able to charge for DLC. But that's not the point. The point is if you're going to make a PC game, do it right. Don't do a sloppy port, especially when every game in your series has been PC-centric (maybe not CoD4, but definitely 1 and 2).\n\nPerhaps the worst part is the wave of people who are in-favor of the changes IW is making to the face of PC gaming. Those people need to wake up: mods and community are incredibly important to the PC gaming community, and embracing their demise is spitting in the face of creativity. Honestly, why are so many console gamers happy that the PC version is subpar? Your version is just as terrible; the only difference is you're used to playing and buying poor multiplayer. If you would push a little harder maybe you could be making mods, playing on dedicated servers, and have ""features"" such as lean. But no, this is not your style.\n\nBut I think everything that can be said has been said about MW2 for PC. I personally purchased all previous CoD games the day they were released, starting with the first one. They are fun and were always a great experience for me. The original CoD even lured me away from BF1942, which was an incredible multiplayer experience itself.  To think this CoD will turn me back to EA and DICE. How times change.\n\nSo to everyone who buys the game I hope you enjoy it (although I wish you wouldn't buy the PC version at all). But I think most enthusiast/hardcore/whatever PC gamers will agree with me when I say I'm a bit saddened today. It's like meeting an old friend who has changed greatly since you last saw them. You always long for what things used to be like.  CoD: MW2 is not a healthy step forward for PC gaming, but several major leaps backward, and that is just a shame.\n\nSigh. C'est la vie.";Truly a Sad Day for PC Gamers
238;251.0;1.0;5.0;For those of you who played the original Modern Warfare, stay away from this sequel at all costs, infinity ward has removed a number of things from the PC version that have long since been routine for any modern PC game.\n\nThe reason for this?, well they basically just ported the console versions to the PC, and save themselves some work, the interesting thing is that all though the PC version was not the mother of all version, they still wanna charge you more for it. Nothing but greedy bastards producing low quality sequels.\nWhat are some of the consequences of infinity ward wanting to take some early vacation time and dissing the PC version of the game?, all of the console limitations are passed on to the PC, things like max number of players in multiplayer matches, 18 is the new max, you guys kidding? 9v9? really?\nNo console, for all of you who like to customize your game to your particular gaming rig, no more, you're stuck with whatever stupid settings the console versions have, even if your gaming rig is twice as powerful.\n\nConclusion? DON'T BUY THIS CRAP.;PC Gamers BEWARE, this is the ultimate screw you from infinity ward

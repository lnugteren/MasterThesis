5;1.0;1.0;7.0;"""Lost In Blue"" is one of those sub-par games that want to be so much better than they are, and the fact that they aren't is such a tragedy that you almost feel bad for the people who have to market them.  Don't get me wrong, there are fun aspects to the game; spear-fishing, for instance, is a hoot, and after spending days (in game-time) on the brink of starvation, the opportunity to finally see a full Hunger meter is truly satisfying.  I should also mention in all fairness that the game does make good, if limited, use of the DS touch screen and microphone, mostly through the aforementioned spear fishing and through fire building.  Unfortunately, these bright spots are too few and far between to add up to a game worth playing, or at least paying full-price for, and I spent much of my time feeling angry and frustrated at the game's nonintuitive and often downright illogical gameplay.  Bow-hunting, for instance, is almost impossible without the use of snare traps, and even then it's irritatingly hit-or-miss; using snare traps essentially entails watching an animal as it walks, making a guess as to where its path will take it, and placing the trap and hoping your prediction was correct.  If it was correct, great; if it wasn't, and the animal changes direction at the last second, you're screwed, because traps can't be reused once set.  You can also capture and domesticate a goat for the ostensible purpose of obtaining milk, but even though I did everything I was supposed to do (capture goat--check, bring home--check, provide partner with bottles--double check), the goat went unmilked until it finally keeled over dead in the night.  But what really killed the game, and what made me lose interest and leave it unfinished, is the fact that halfway through the game, you're required to leave your partner behind at camp and strike out on your own for a few days, making sure that she has enough food and water so that she won't die while you're gone, and the game offers absolutely no explanation for why you can't just take her with you even though she's perfectly capable of making the trip with your assistance.  Worse yet, at the cave which serves as your home-away-from-home, there are TWO ready-made (not to mention unexplained) sleeping pallets, only serving to underscore the question.  And worse even than THAT, she proves time and again to be so wildly inept at taking care of herself--flatly ignoring the barrel full of fresh water and letting herself slowly die of thirst, for instance--that you may well have to abandon your quest midway through and run home to stop her from killing herself.  (She also has an unfortunate tendency to wander away from the cave, leaving you to search for her before she dies of exposure.  You may feel tempted to just let her go and be rid of her, but the game won't let you do that; if she dies, the game ends.)  You'll most likely end up running home a few times anyway, as the game only lets you stockpile a few days' worth of provisions for her to live off of, and exploring the ruins will almost certainly take far longer than that.  I can't imagine why the game's designers would intentionally include such a flawed puzzle, but it's there, it can't be avoided, and it frustrated me to no end.\n\nSince I've already rambled on far too long, I'll only mention in passing the game's thinly-disguised sexism in the form of a male character who does all the hunting and gathering and a female character who hardly ever leaves home, as well as the sudden jarring digression into Tomb Raider territory that comes with exploring the ruins.  Once you've beaten the game, you have the option of playing it through again from your partner's point of view, a page clearly taken from the book of Resident Evil 2 (fortunately, that's where the similarity ends!), but since I gave up on the game halfway through the first playthrough, I can't offer any opinions on that particular aspect.  Honestly, though, the fact that the first half of the game is so hard to get through with your patience intact proves--to me, anyway--that it really doesn't matter if the second half is enjoyable or not.  All in all, while ""Lost in Blue"" does offer a few innovative and fun gameplay elements, the aggregate experience was so overwhelmingly negative for me that I can only recommend this game if you're not the kind of person who is easily frustrated, and even then, you should probably look for a used copy.";Where's Wilson when you need him?!
4;2.0;4.0;85.0;Lost in Blue is an amazing game, one of those that makes full advantage of the unique opportunities the Nintendo DS affords.\n\nA sequel to the game Survival Kids, Lost in Blue puts you in the role of a young man shipwrecked on a tropical island.  It is up to you to hunt, gather, survive, and create in ways that will help you live in comfort and perhaps even make your way off of the island.\n\nJoining you is a female character, who creates furniture and tools from the items you bring to her.  The game really takes advantage of the setting, as sticks and stones and vines and shells can all be brought together to form new items.  Attack a sharp rock to a stick and you have a spear.  String a vine on a stick and you have a bow.  It's things like these that make this game great.\n\nThe adventure is vast, and you can travel at your own pace in exploring the island, so this game will last as long as you want it to, really.  With a whole world to explore, and two characters to take care of, it can extend into a long, enriching experience.  Very highly recommended!;A Great Adventure
3;3.0;5.0;58.0;"well, i just finished playing the first two hours of this game, and here's my opinion:\n\nas of now, i'm still struggling to get by day-to-day.. and i do mean struggling. this basically means that i eat, drink and sleep just enough to get by to the next day. i'm still experimenting with food to find out what's poisonous and what tastes better cooked or raw (orange, white and brown mushrooms appear to be no-nos, but then again, it could be a matter of cooking or seasoning them properly instead of just gobbling them up as soon as i find them!!) fortunately, poison only lasts a few minutes, but i have already died once from lack of water before i discovered the ""watering hole"" just to the south of our cave. you can't get by on the water in coconuts for very long!!\n\ni've made my first spear, which i use to gather as much fish as possible before i get tired and have to go back to the cave. digging for clams and shaking the coconut trees keeps me pretty busy too! i've found some spices, but not enough to do anything with yet.\n\nfiremaking and fishing utilize the special DS features -- the microphone and the touchscreen. once you've steadily tapped L and R to get the fire started, you have to blow in the microphone to get the fire to catch. you've also got to be quick and jab the stylus at the screen to nail fish with your spear. just like any real-life survival skill - tricky at first, but fairly easy once you get the hang of it.\n\none thing that irks me is how hard it is to keep up your stamina. i could spend a whole day resting and still not be 100% rested. ditto goes for the girl... i leave her in the cave all day, and instead of resting, she just stands there and ends up being tired when i get home with all of the food. seems like the only way to get her to rest is to drag her along with me and make her rest when i do.\n\nanother thing i don't like is how unforgiving the game is during the learning curve. once you find an item, the directions they give are clear enough, but you have to rely on your own good luck to blunder onto some of the items or areas that you need to find to move onto the next phase of the game. they should have given more hints by way of suggestions or conversations between the characters. that would have been helpful.\n\noverall, i'm pleased with the game. for the price and the enjoyment i've gotten from it already, i'm happy. it has the potential to get a little tedious if i'm doing the scrabbling-for-my-next-nap-and-meal thing for too long, but i'd definitely say this is one of the better titles offered for the DS.  based on another review posted on here, it sounds like i've got a lot to look forward to as the game progresses!";lost in blue, a first impression.
0;4.0;5.0;20.0;All right, alot of people seem to be having trouble with the game and i'd like for more people to enjoy the experience that is lost in blue so im going to drop a hint.\n\nif you plan on taking a long journey or just exherting yourself to a higher extent, than be sure to eat as much as you can and....just go to bed early. its that easy.\n\nive seen that alot of people are having trouble staying alive and it was the same for me in the beginning, so please, use this hint and discover the many mysteries that the island holds. happy ...er surviving?;PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6;5.0;5.0;6.0;"This is the first time I truly want to write a review for a game. This game ROCKS. However, I did feel it is very hard in the beginning, so that I asked my boyfriend to help me a bit. He is a quite experienced gamer with PSP. When he started to play this game, he STICK with it. From the moment I give him my Nintendo DS lite and the game, I feel like it is not my property anymore:) He just cannot put it down. How interesting is that. Then after I watched him playing for quite a while, this game is not that hard for me. We talked about the difficulties in the game all the time. Oh, BTW, I could always go to those websites to check some tips and knowledge for the game. So that if you meet some difficulties that you cannot talk to someone, just go to the Internet, search it in the google, like ""how to make a trap in Lost in Blue"". etc, you will always be able to solve it through other people's experience. It is so fun. I really like the fishng, hunting, makeing tool, making furniture modes. It is so much fun. And everytime I explored a new place, I get soooo excited. Please trust me, your HP, hunger, thirsty will get more and more easy to accomplish as you play the game more and more. And you will be able to get more and more foods as you play. In the game I already died for like 10 times, but I kept going. And I am so happy that I bought this game. Now I haven't played my other DS games a while, as I truly want to finish the Keith mode and unlock the girl mode. Let's see!";Lost in Blue is Fantastic
8;6.0;4.0;12.0;if u don't know the feel of this game, think castaway meets havest moon.  in the begining u can gather coconuts, seaweed, clams to survive. later on you have the ability to fish, hunt, and explore the island that u are stuck on.  sounds pretty mundane but just like watering your plants everyday in havest moon, you'll find it enjoyable. near the end u can explore ruins and solve puzzles.  and depending on how u finish the game, u can open new modes to play as skye (the girl) and another secret character.  (i can't say cuz it will ruined the plot).\n\none minor flaw about this game is the character storage system.  there just isn't enough space in your backpack to put everything in.  but that isn't enough to spoil the major fun of the game.;enjoyable but have minor flaws
7;7.0;5.0;7.0;"I have only had my DS a few months now and the reason I bought a DS is so I could purchase Lost in Blue.  But finding this game was like a needle in a haystack! It is sooo hard to find! Geewhiz!  Well after about 2 months of keeping tabs on my local gamestores, a preowned copy came in yesterday.  Needless to say I swiped it up quick! lol When I saw it sitting there on the store shelf, I got so excited I felt like a kid again. =) I was like ""Ah!!! I found it!!"" lol  And for only about $25 preowned!  I had the most stupid grin on my face too! lol  Well I got the game home..the reason I bought the DS...and I started playing.  It is so fun!  I am very very pleased.  It's a little difficult though right now since I just started.  I already died once and Skye died once since I was away.  I forgot to leave her food and water. My bad.  Now I know.  I had made a fire too by combining certain items.  Skye has cooked a few different meals for us already as well.  Our health levels are still very low but I heard you get stronger the more you play and progress.  I had gathered coconuts by picking them up off the ground and shaking them from trees.  I have dug up clams and picked up seaweed.  I haven't tried the mushrooms yet but I heard some of them are poisoness but they say the effects only last a few minutes thank goodness.  I still gotta figure out how to get water from a source besides coconuts.  I heard the river is a source but I have to see how to do that today after work.  I am looking so forward to finding the raw materials to build a fishing rod in order to fish...being the fisherman in real life that I am.  The hunting with a bow aspect looks really cool too.  Graphics and sound effects in this game are nicely done as well.  It's gonna be a long day at work today thinkin about Lost in Blue until I get home! lol My only problem is that I have to pry my wife off the DS then b/c she is hooked on Yoshi's Island on the DS! lol  In my opinion, just about anyone can enjoy Lost In Blue.  I am an avid gamer into racing and rpgs and such, but I highly enjoy Lost in Blue and I highly recommend it.  Enjoy! =)";Great game!
9;8.0;5.0;10.0;"Posted Summer 2006:\nI can understand why this game has mixed reviews.  It's not for everyone.  I myself didn't think I'd get this game because of the overall poor reviews but, fortunately, I bought it.  It was definitely for me.\n\nMy main reason for playing this game is for the cute boy-girl relationship.  Goes back to the basic where the boy hunts and gathers and the girl cooks.  It's that simplicity of life that is very appealing.  What more do we want?  A boy and a girl on a remote island where they wake up every morning together and survive.  That, to me, is a dream life.  By contrast, I look at reality and... well you know the rest.\n\nThis game is like the Sims.  It has no objective.  You control Keith and let him just go about living a peaceful life with Skye and survive by the day.  Many say it's like Animal Crossing but I never played that.  My enjoyment comes out of living this dreamy, simple life and so when I perform the repetitive tasks I don't find them boring.  In fact, I find them very fun.  How else are these two going to survive if we don't work?!?!  You'll find that you'll need to possess or develop managerial skills so that both Keith and Skye continue to live.  In my opinion it was not difficult as some make it.  As long as you pay attention to their needs you'll be fine.  I'm not a gamer and I died once on my first try.  After that my Keith is doing great (bulking up on proteins and carbohydrate from fish and potatoes).  Once you get into the rhythm of the game it'll be intuitive.\n\nI actually bought the Nintendo DS just because of this game (one good game justifies buying a whole new system).  I'm sure I'll be spending more time on Lost in Blue... and I hope you find it as much fun as I do.\n\nUpdate: April 17, 2007\nSince I already posted brief description of the game itself (as many others have) I won't repeat.  But I wanted to give an update (in retrospect) on this game now that I've had it for a year.  I should mention that for a long time I've been an anti-gamer (not a fan of most games).  I remember originally buying NDS just for Lost in Blue.. and fell in love with it since (that's putting it mildly).  Today, I can honestly say that I still feel just as strongly about the game as I had a year ago.  I do not intend buying any more games for NDS.  The NDS will sustain its purpose just for Lost in Blue (maybe Lost in Blue 2 but I have reservations with most sequels).  This game is special to me.  As you already know, I'm a firm believer that one good game does justify buying an entire system.\n\nHowever, whether or not Lost in Blue is that game for anyone else will depend on why you play games.  It would be difficult to imagine that this title garner the interest of mainstream audience because most just aren't into the relational aspect (intimacy and bond with and between virtual beings).  Chances are.. if you didn't like The Sims, Harvest Moon, and Animal Crossing you won't like this game.  If you're the type who doesn't put feelings into objects or subjects you are with you will view doing the tedious task in Lost in Blue as ""boring"" since you don't really care for the virtual beings.  Meanwhile, those of us who do so will find the repetitive tasks quite addicting.  That is why I enjoy this game.. because when I play I bond with the characters and I want them to succeed.  When they succeed.. it makes me happy.  I enjoy the ""work"" of finding clams and harvesting crops.  I suspect that others who also enjoy this game are also in it on an emotional level.  There is a subconscious desire for a simplistic, back-to-nature life (boy and girl coexisting together in traditional fashion).  This game will sure to help people get that feel we don't often get these days of being with someone for whom we want to care for and protect (okay I admit, I'm obsessed with this game).\n\nUnlike most games, this is one that transcends gender.. it's appeal can attract either men or women (or boy/girl).  In my estimation it really depends if you're an emotional person.  If you're fortunate enough to be part of the minority who appreciates this game you'll understand what I mean when I say that the game strongly resonates with us in a deep way.  I hope you find the game thrilling but I can't make any promises that you will enjoy it since I do not believe it is a game with mass appeal.  But I can say that I wholeheartedly love this game and for me it contains a timeless and universal quality about it.";For the lovers...
16;9.0;4.0;13.0;This is a very good game but it could have been a great game if it weren't for a few things. My main problem is with Skye. Sometimes you are on the other side of the island but have to come all the way back to give her food and water because she hasn't eaten or drinked anything since you left even though there is a ton of food and water in the cave and you told her you would be gone for a few days.\n\nShe is very useful however because she makes many necessary things for you such as baskets, rope, jerky, and she cooks for you if you ask her. But on the other hand many times I left the cave and her only task was to keep the fire going by throwing twigs on it and she couldn't even do that. I returned to the cave only to find that the fire was out and she was complaining it was too cold for her to do anything. But there were 30 twigs in the corner for her to use!\n\nWhen you capture certain animals in the game such as a chicken or a goat, you get to either eat them or domesticate them. I trapped both at two different periods in the game. All Skye had to do was domesticate them so that we could get milk and eggs....but they both died!\n\nMy other problem with her is that it is a pain to travel with her because she has very bad eyesight and Ketih broke her glasses. So you have to pick her up, pull her up, hold her hand to guide her, and push logs that she can climb on top of in order for her to overcome obstacles .\n\nI played Ico which was similar in that you had to lead the female character around to the point that it seemed as if she was completely brainless and helpless. But I loved the game nevertheless. However Skye's character is just frustrating. Its even more frustrating to have to be nice to her so that she and Keuth maintain a good relationship even though she is the dumbest AI ever!\n\nOne other minor problem I had was when I was hunting I went into the menu to pull out a large trap but when I came out of the menu the animal had moved to another spot or disappeared, it only happened twice thankfully but save your game before using a large trap just in case. Also when I killed a small animal I had a hard time finding it in the grass then I hard a harder time finding the carcass.\n\nDespite this I love the game! It is innovative and challenging having to keep your characters alive by hunting, fishing, and gathering food. You also get to invent new weapons, tools, and furniture to put inside your cave. It is very hard at first but as you make tools and come upon new materials that you can make into various useful objects it gets easier and more fun.\n\nBut if you do not like games where you have to almost babysit helpless characters then it is not for you. I was able to overlook it because of the nice graphics activities. For example, if i want to catch fish I can go to the river with my spear which is harder but much more fun or use a fishing rod. I can also make different kinds of fishing rods or spears that last longer, are more durable etc Also when you build furniture there is a mini game. I do not recommend this game for anyone without patience.;Fun game despite skye (spolier alert)
1;10.0;4.0;13.0;"This game is very much a cross between the hit tv show ""Lost"" and ""The Sims"". While i will admit that there is a significant learning curve in the beginning of the game, it gets relatively easier as you progress. It is highly addictive as I believe i am about half done with the game and I've had this game for about 2 weeks now. This is a very good addition to an NDS library. I choose this over Castlevania DS, Lunar DS, and Trace Memory, (all of which were released in a week's span) and I am glad i made a good decision. Innovative titles such as this one are what first drew me toward gaming nearly two decades ago.";A Refreshing, addictive experience
14;11.0;2.0;11.0;"This game was very disappointing.  At first, it sounded very promising and different.  You're Keith and you're stranded on an island after the cruise ship you were on has sunken.  Now you have to stay alive using your ""survival skills"".  There's also another person on the island, Skye, that Keith meets up with who was also on the same ship.  However, she is so dimwitted, whiny and completely useless that she makes you want to kill her just to eat her.  It's bad enough to hear Keith whine and complain every few seconds.  Eh, but killing her, unfortunately, is not an option.  Afterall, she's a major part of the story line blah blah blah.  After you've been formally introduced, Keith ""accidently"" steps on her glasses and renders her completely blind apparently because she's completely incapable of moving around on her own.  You than turn into her seeing eye dog and have to hold her hand constantly to move her around, otherwise, she'll stay in one spot.  This will slow down the journey considerably.  Along the way, you'll have to pick up scarcely scattered coconuts, clams, potatoes, mushrooms etc. to eat and drink as well as sticks and twigs to build fires.  But as you venture on, you lose health due to running just as fast as you can feed him.  Before you know it, you've already died 50 times.  This is pretty frustrating especially when he can't run when his health is low and you can't get food and water to him fast enough.  This pretty much comprises much of the game's objective, to keep the bastard alive.  In other words...boring.  You'll constantly have to feed Keith and take time to let his lazy ass rest every 5 minutes.  His little buddy Skye is not any better and you'll have to do the same for her.  Did I mention there's endless walking and climbing through what looks like the same patch of dead grass over and over again?  Yeah well, you'll be doing a lot of that only occasionally stopping to push a log.  The stylus can't even be used to move the characters.  The characters are so pixelated to the point that they look like walking squares.  Possibly the only redeeming aspect of this game is the tool making, hunting, and fishing parts which were mildly enjoyable, but definitely won't make up for the lack of ""fun"" in the rest of the game.  This game has no replay value. Pass on this game and pick up Trace Memory, a similar but much better title as well as a number of other much better DS titles.";The equivalent of watching water boil
2;12.0;5.0;12.0;"I've been waiting for this game to come out for quite some time now and I am happy to say that it meets all my expectations. This game is really well put together and the graphics are great.\n\nYou've been washed upon the shores of a deserted island and with your health severely sapped you must get food quickly and find a place to sleep to rest up. It'll take you a while to get back into peak performance to start exploring the island. Shortly after you arrive a girl from the same ship as you washes up and the two of you quickly become a good team.\n\nSkye (the girl) is nearsighted and her glasses are broken. To top things off her ankle is swollen too, severly restricting her movements. Because of this she is put in charge of maintaining the cave you call home and keeping the fire stoked. She'll cook meals, make rope and bamboo baskets, allowing you to expore and catch better food. The more you explore and bring back food, the better a cook she'll become and the healthier both of you will get.\n\nThis game is really intuitive. When you walk up to something an icon in the top right corner changes to tell you what you can do. The touch screen isn't a big part of playing save for digging up potatos an the like for food. You do use the touch-screen for ""building"" mini-games when you want to upgrade things like your bed.\n\nEach day is a struggle for survival, and that is quite literal. If either of your health drops to 0 the game is over and maintaining that health is really painstaking. You can only hold 20 items in your bag, and items like Spears and Wood-Makers take up more room than they look like they do, giving you little space for food and fire-wood to bring back. Other items such as vines (which can be made into rope) and Bamboo are so scarce that it sometimes takes several days to get enough material to make the item you desperately need. Spears break-all-too-easily and you're constantly having to save space for parts to make tools. You really have to plan out as much as you can in advance and that's what makes this game so much fun.\n\nThe more you play, the further you can explore, the healthier you become, and the more-likely that you'll be able to find a way off the island. I have only reached day 44 and I've already explored quite a bit of the island (though I did die twice in the process). The game has 2 save slots, and a special ""quick-save"" feature which is helpfull if you need to put the game down right away. The graphics are great, and the map is indespensable.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that's gonna keep you hooked and playing for a LONG time this is one of them. It's not a game you beat after so many days. You can take as long as you want to get off the island, and everything you do effects the ending (or so i've been told) so it's new everytime. I'm a slow-and-steady kind of person so i've been just gradually building everything up and it's really begining to pay off. Not your average RPG, but still worth the look anyway ^_^";so hungry so little time...
18;13.0;2.0;11.0;My biggest beef with the game, that if fixed, would make it worth ten times its weight in gold would be that the Virtual Hours pass by in a matter of seconds. Pretend it's 4:00 am. If the boy walks form one tree over to another tree two feet away !POOF! It's 8:00 am. Then you go through the small cut scene where he finds the cave and! POOF! It's all the sudden 11:00 pm and time to go to bed, but there is nowhere to sleep. Other than that, the gameplay is fun, the mini-games are awesome, making tools is fun and hunting is awesome but difficult. Once you get the hang of keeping them alive for several 2 hour days, it gets a lot easier as things begin to float up on shore and other surprises. Hope you can survive long enough to escape, cause it almost made me pull what's left of my hair out.;Very Dissapointing
15;14.0;5.0;10.0;"Lost in Blue is my favorite out of all the DS games I've played.\n\nThe game starts when the cruise ship you (Kieth) are riding on wrecks, stranding you on a desert island. Soon you meet a hot girl named Skye, and the real adventure begins as both of you struggle to survive and explore the giant, mysterious Island.\n\nI don't give five stars out for anything, and I truly feel this is one of the few games that deserves such a high rating. The fun factor, graphics, and gameplay are superb. The designers have also done a great job incorporating the touch screen. For example, you'll blow into the mic to start fires and use the stylus as a spear to catch fish, among other things.\n\nThe game is a bit challenging at first, but as you keep playing you'll get the hang of it. You'll find that there's a solution for every problem if you just use your head. People say it takes too long to cross the island, but there's a way to create shortcuts. I've also heard some complaints that building furniture is too hard, my advice to you is just keep trying. When I first attempted to build a bed it took me twenty tries, I wanted to throw my DS against the wall. But through practice I've gotten excellent at building furniture and now it's one of my favorite parts of the game. Just use quick, hard strokes.\n\nSkye is also not a ""useless"" character nor does she represent a negative gender stereotype. The reason she stays behind in the cave cooking and making things is because her glasses broke and it's difficult for her to walk, not so much because she's a girl. To the person complaining that she wouldn't keep the fire going, if her hunger, thirst, or fatigue ratings reach 0% she won't be able to do things like that. It also helps to tell her if you're going to be gone for a long period of time.\n\nTo sum up this game is a perfect mix of strategy, adventure, and dexterity. There are so many new things to find, it seems like every other day I discover something else,. whether it be an animal I haven't seen before, a food, or just learning a new skill or making a new tool. This game is awesome!";The best DS game made so far
19;15.0;5.0;10.0;This is yet another reason to buy a ds!! Lost in Blue is a unique and fantastic game. It's so addicting. It's got elements of a collection game...yet you're trying to survive, so you mostly collect food. You can hunt, fish, dig, and other stuff I probably haven't discovered yet, with the stylus. My favorite is spearing fish in the water with my 'spear'. It's also got elements of puzzle and mystery games. You have to discover things on the island, and figure out what you need to find to make new tools. In the beginning, its really tough to find edible food, but later on, you have a multitude of choices. I highly recommend Lost in Blue, especially if you love DS and want more stylus time in games. :) Enjoy!;Love, Love, LOVE Lost in Blue!
10;16.0;4.0;6.0;I descibed this game to someone as like playing The Blue Lagoon in a video game.  You're shipwrecked on an island and you have to survive.  You have to find food, water, and shelter and eventually try to make your way off the island.  There is some level of tedium involved because you have to go searching for food pretty much every day, but there's always new stuff to discover and explore.  I really do enjoy this game.\n\nThings that I'm not as fond of:\n\n* I have a minor problem with the fact that the girl is practically useless, especially in the beginning ... she sits in the cave and cooks ... eventually, she makes stuff, but it would be a lot more helpful, especially in the beginning if she could help gather food or at least get her own water!\n\n* The controls on the game are sort of annoying as well ... they're not very intuitive and whenever you have to climb or jump, you have to press a key ... that's fine, except that you do this so often and you have to do it in such specific spots that it gets a bit annoying.\n\n* When you fish, you have to continually re-enter fishing mode to go on ... you can't just stay and get like 10 fish. You have to go into fishing mode whenever you make a spear cast and it just takes time and is seemingly pointless.\n\nI think that's it ... overall, a great game.  Really unique premise and a good use of the features of the DS.;Great Premise, Weak on Some Minor Things
11;17.0;3.0;6.0;The first part (mode) of this game is excellent. You play as a young man who is shipwrecked on a tropical island, with a girl of the same age. The whole premise is that you have to find a way to eek out a living however you can and eventually get rescued. You make weapons (for hunting and fishing- no battle in this game!) You gather food and water and range all over the island, solving puzzles. All very fun, for those virtual life fanatics. And guess what! After you finish the firt mode, you unlock a second mode, where you get to play as the girl....\n\n....Except the game makers must not think much of girls. She's useless. She's half-blind and so weak that she can't even pull herself over tiny rocks, in order to explore the island. All she can do is hang around your cave home all day, gathering clams and cooking. Over and over and over. If you're lucky, the boy may come home late one night with news of all the fun things he's been doing on the island. Yay. How insulting to female gamers, like myself- and boring!\n\nAll I can say is- buy this game for the first mode. Have fun for a week, and then leave it alone, before the second mode poisons your soul.;Half great, half horrible
12;18.0;5.0;6.0;"I got this game about a week ago, and it is excellent! You start off in the begining with just Keith who is ship wrecked on a deserted island and have to get through the first night by making a ""fire making tool"" gather some twigs to make a fire, and eating enough food like coconuts to get enough food and water in your system. If you don't then you won't have enough HP to get through the next couple of days. After the first night you can go try to find the only other person who was on the same ship, Skye.\n\nYou will then have to build tools so you can catch fish or other animals. You can also gather food to eat which Skye can cook for you. If you don't do that you obviously won't survive.\n\nOne other thing about this game, in the begining you break Skyes  glasses, so you literally have to hold her hand when you bring her places which can become kind of tedious. Not to mention lowers your strength/stamina a lot quicker.\n\nBut all in all this is an excellent game, it is very addictive and fun to play, it is not a fast paced action game, but if your not into that then you probably wouldn't like this game. But if you like animal crossing and harvest moon then you'd probably like this game. all in all wonderful game!";Lost in Blue
13;19.0;5.0;6.0;"The concept behind this game is simple: survive.  Survival isn't usually action-packed, I'm sorry to say, so if you tire with things like making sure your character doesn't die, don't play this game.  This is a game for people that don't like playing games that are so much like real life.  I don't want to talk around a city with a bunch of ""Urbs"" making sure I don't piss my pants - I'd rather play ""Trapped in the Stone Age"" on a deserted island.  Why?  It sure ain't the excitement!  Most of the game is gathering, and if you're lucky, some hunting.\n\nI have only died once in the game, but this is because I understand how to play the game.  You can't just run off and explore - you have to think!  How much water does the girl have?  How much do you have?  Do you have any food on you that you could eat in case you have to eat on your exploration?  Are you searching for anything, e.g. stones, sticks, or food?  Beyond that, the game is really based in surviving and exploring the island.\n\nThe complexity of the game is far greater than anticipated, however.  You have to build a lot of stuff, from beds to rafts, and each item you build costs resources - you have to find logs and vines, make the vines into rope, then make the raft.  And you have to do that six times.  Building, cooking, gathering, spear fishing, etc. are all based in the touchpad; this is the best integrated game I have seen in regards to analog control of the characters and stylus control of action.  If one was to buy this game for no other reason, it would be to showcase the Nintendo DS and all of its abilities.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nIf you like doing puzzles, get this game.\n\nIf you like ""The Sims,"" get this game.\n\nIf you liked ""Zork"" (the original one), get this game.\n\nYou don't have to like Zork now.\n\nBut if you ever did, you will like this game.\n\nThis is an RPG with no action, but to say that it is no fun is bogus; it's just not the certain type of fun that specific audiences are looking for.  But, in my case, it's a perfect game for me.  If they come out with a business/stock exchange simulation, I'd be all over it, but for many, that wouldn't be fun.  But make no mistake, kids; all video games are pointless.";Let's Be Realistic
17;20.0;4.0;5.0;Lets talk LOST......I buy this game for me, so I can disappear and play something that is not a shoot em up or collect battle cards....and my 12 year old steals it and has been playing it ever since....and he has those shootem up games for his DS.\n\nAnyway its a really fun game once you figure out your momentum of keeping yourself and Skye feed, not thirsty or tired.  You have to use whats there to do stuff.  Its kind of Lost meets Survivor.  I will enjoy it if I ever see it again.;Lost in Blue

8;1.0;4.0;34.0;The biggest complaint from the other reviews is the DRM. The DRM has changed since then. When this game first came out, you can only install this game three times one one machine, and that's it. That's why everyone was upset about it, and they had the right, I was upset as well. But it's changed now. The DRM is still there, but it's not a bother anymore. It restricts you to 3 installs per month. After a month, those 3 installs reset.  Unless you love uninstalling your games every week, I doubt 3 installs per month will be a hassle for you.;Other reviews are out of date
96;2.0;1.0;210.0;"Yes, this is a DRM based review.  Why is this important?  Because the major game publishers appear to have decided that even though you are rewarding their efforts with your hard earned money, you don't actually OWN this title.  They have decided that they will decide how and where you will use their product.  For the record I do not condone piracy, but it is equally unacceptable to limit my legal use of the game or to try to make it difficult or impossible for me to resale the title later.  It is unacceptable to install programs on my PC that monitor how I use the game and seek to monitor my compliance with their terms and conditions.  The only way to keep the publishers from shackling us with this and making it the ""standard practice"" is to yell as loud as possible everytime time it happens.  If you will let me legally use this however and whenever I want, you will be rewarded with my money, otherwise, not one red cent!";Please don't rent this game
85;3.0;1.0;88.0;"I'm sure that people won't have to look too hard to find the cracked version, it's out there already (not that I particularly care; I hated the movie so I figure I'd hate the games too).  That's what makes these draconian DRM schemes all the more ridiculous: the games are cracked, stripped of the DRM and available to be pirated before they hit the store shelves more often than not.  I believe this game was officially released on April 7, 2009 and it is apparently available cracked on April 8, 2009.  That's just laughable and it goes to prove that the DRM isn't there to prevent piracy; it's all about controlling how you can use the product after you pay for it.\n\nClearly the decision to force DRM on games -- especially extra-horrible DRM like this game has -- isn't being made by computer-savvy or intelligent people.  When this game fails to sell well, watch those same idiots blame its failure on piracy instead of DRM.  They're predictable that way: just imagine how a greedy, stupid person would react and there you have it (see: RIAA, MPAA, BPI, etc., for further evidence of this reptilian behavior).";DRM is laughable
92;4.0;1.0;88.0;With the Prohibitive DRM in this game, I will never pay money for it.  With these wacky DRM schemes which do nothing to stop piracy, but end up treating legitimate customers like they're criminals, you never own the game.  You're just renting it from them, should they ever go out of business or stop support on the product, you can't use the product you bought anymore.  Meanwhile, pirates are using a superior product, with no activation which works BETTER than the purchased one.  No thanks, I'll pass.;DRM
78;5.0;1.0;77.0;"I'll just admit that Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher's Bay (this game's prequel) was an absolutely amazing experience. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this... until I saw the ""requires internet connection to play"" notice on the back of the package at a local retail store. Needless to say, I put the game back on the shelf pending more research (I will NOT buy games that included limited internet activations). As it turns out, Dark Athena uses the most stupendously draconian DRM the PC gaming world has ever seen: your $50 buys you exactly 3 installs. Period. You don't ""get any back"" when you uninstall nor can you revoke activations like you can with EA games (which I also refuse to buy since they use limited activations - revoke tools or no). From the moment you buy the game - you can only install it 3 times and then it's done; You can't install it ever again - it just won't run after that. Yup, you are essentially paying full retail for a use-limited rental. Please don't support rentware by purchasing this game. Send Atari the message that you won't stand for this kind of abuse in the only language they'll understand... [lack of] money.\n\nI was a huge fan of the original and a guaranteed buyer for this installment - but Atari lost my business because they don't know how to treat me, a willing, paying customer, with even a modicum of respect. I won't be swindled, abused, or taken advantage of - and I certainly won't PAY for that treatment. SHAME ON YOU, Atari.\n\nTo Starbreeze - I'm really, truly sorry that I won't be able to pay you for your hard work on this game. Hopefully you'll be able to arrange a Steam release without the 3rd party DRM... and the sooner the better. I'll await that day with my Amex at the ready.";Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Consumer Rights
95;6.0;1.0;58.0;I will also have to say what a big disappointment it was to find out this game has DRM.  I had to return Farcry 2 because it had problems running on my system.  I now suspect the problem to have been the DRM software installed on it.\n\nI feel gun shy thinking of shelling out any money for a game with DRM.  I feel like I'm just taking my chances.  Just 3 installs as well?  I have to agree, that's not owning a game.  That's renting.;Dissapointed
98;7.0;1.0;58.0;Almost bought this game, thankfully I read these reviews first. Don't let DRM infect your PC. Remember, once they shut down their activation servers you'll never be allowed to play your game again. You're buying a soon -to-be worthless plastic disc, not a game.;Just saved $50, thanks DRM!
2;8.0;1.0;56.0;"Atari state up to 3 installs on different machines and unlimited installs on any one of those machine EXCEPT for (a) major changes in hardware or (b) operating system re-installs.\n\nWell, let us consider JUST item (b) above.\n\nI have a PC running Win XP. I install Riddick:Athena. #1 install\nI now upgrade to Vista. I reinstall Riddick: Athena. #2 install\nI then upgrade to Windows7. I reinstall Riddick:Athena. #3 install.\n\nNo revoke tool. I'm out of installs, just by a perfectly legitimate and very likely sequence of events. Microsoft will be offering free upgrades to Windows 7 for purchasers of Vista later this year. One involuntary re-install in the above sequence means groveling to Atari - by a perfectly legitimate paying customer.\n\nBTW, there is a very strong case here for a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission. NOWHERE in the documentation provided with the US PC version of the game is there any mention at all of the install count-limit. And the only reference to on-line authentication at all on the US PC edition is the following totally misleading statement in small print on the back cover "" Other: Internet connection required for first-time authentication (connection not required after authentication) ""\n\nAlso, the EULA states the following:- ""You may make and maintain one copy of this software for backup and archival purposes provide that the original and copy of the software are kept in your possession. You may permanently transfer your rights under this EULA, provide you retain no copies, you transfer all the software(including all component parts, the media and printed materials and any upgrades) and the recipent reads and accepts this EULA""\n\nAll very well - the standard boiler-plate EULA permitting 3rd-party transfer. No mention at all anywhere in the EULA of the ""3 strikes and you are out"" install-limit......\n\nThe above section of the EULA is followed by a section listing 5 RESTRICTIONS placed on the purchaser. A missed opportunity to list the install-limits..... naw, easier not to mention them at all.....\n\nThe FTC in their hearing in Seattle on March 25 on media DRM, made very clear to developers and purveyors that they were going to take legal action against those who failed to convey to the customer, up-front and before purchase, in clear language, not buried in a EULA, the exact restrictions of their DRM.\n\nAtari sales and marketing must have hamburger for brains and concrete in their ear-canals.\n\nFYI: The US PC version of Riddick:Athena uses Tages DRM, not SecureROM.";Riddick DRM - Atari has hamburger for brains.......
99;9.0;1.0;55.0;I was sooo looking forward to this game , but not now ...once again , as others stated I will not purchace any game with limited installs and no revoke tool , $50 to rent a game is unexceptable . DRM's are ok to a point , but install limints ARE NOT .\n\nGaming companies will eventually learn that treating legit customers like idiots/fools just does not work . When gaming companies go under/broke maybe they will learn.;What a shame , limited installls AGAIN !!!
86;10.0;1.0;53.0;"I can't believe that after the public outcry with the EA games that Atari would go ahead with this type of DRM. 3 Installs with no revoke capability is crazy. I will not buy this game and warn everyone know about it. It doesn't matter how good the game is or isn't; this type of thing needs to stop and they need to start listening to customers if they want our money.";You have got to be kidding me!
87;11.0;1.0;49.0;Publishers don't seem to realize that these draconian DRM schemes only causes headaches for customers and discourage future legitimate purchases.;Again?
88;12.0;1.0;49.0;Not really hard to comprehend.  Whats really sad is that this will do nothing to stop people who want to pirate the game.  It will only stop people from buying it.;Treating customer like criminal = Fail
81;13.0;1.0;35.0;"Once again, another game I was looking forward to, but will never own. Why do these companies insist on DRM?  I have NEVER pirated a game. I HAVE installed ""no CD"" cracks on games I've purchased.  But I have never purchased a game with DRM that was stronger than a CD check or CD key, and never will (Not including Valve games, purchased through Steam).\n\nNot only that, the one review here states that it's a checkpoint save game. That is one of the most irritating things in any game. I can't believe there is no way to Save the game at any time on a PC game.  Vin Diesel should be ashamed of himself for attaching his name to this game and publisher.\n\nMaybe Atari should go back to making gaming consoles and stay away from game publishing, because they are failing if this is a game they thought would be a big sell! I wouldn't purchase this game for consoles either. If a game publisher wants to treat it's PC customers as criminals, why give them money for the console version either?";Once again, another game I wanted to buy, but will never own.
0;14.0;1.0;34.0;"Video game companies must be punished for abusing their customers with DRM.  Please do not buy any game or support any company that uses DRM.\n\nI am more than willing to pay for and support games from companies that actually appreciate their customers.

84;15.0;1.0;34.0;I install games over and over again. I have recently reinstalled Diablo 2 for about the 6th time and the first 2 Fallout games. All are legitimately bought, i just like to play them over and over, every few years.\n\nI would have bought Spore until I found out about the DRM limited install debacle. I didn't buy it, I now think twice about buying any EA games.\n\nI loved the first Riddick game, and probably would have bought this one, but it seems my only option is to pay $50 for a 3 time rental.\n\nNo thanks.;3 install limit = lost customer
93;16.0;1.0;34.0;Prohibitive DRM means you're rolling the dice on whether or not the game will work for you - and the odds get worse over time.\n\nIt's a darn shame - I really want to like Vin Diesel's stuff.;Want to pay $50 to rent a game?
40;17.0;1.0;33.0;I will never know if this game is any good because I refuse to buy a game that will eventually cease to work.  I'm sure the pirates out there are having a blast with it.  Congratulations on accomplishing nothing and losing legitimate business, not to mention, credibility as a publisher.  I will think twice before buying Atari software in the future.  Thanks Atari, I was actually looking forward to this one.;Could have been great.  I'll never know.
1;18.0;1.0;31.0;I was going to buy this game because I loved the first Riddick game. But I could not find any info on the specs of the game. I then found out that it has DRM and limited installs. I tried to get info of mim operating specs from ATARI that was a month ago. I think after the three installs that Atari should have to return any money paid to them. Unless Atari changes I do not think I will ever buy any games from them again. Pc or console.;Riddick Assault on Dark Athena
4;19.0;1.0;31.0;DRM kills it, you would think they would learn EAs lesson, customers don't like this, they won't accept it, you can forget this sale and future Atari titles until you come to your senses, if you ever do. Atari just begs to go bankrupt apparently.;Great potential
94;20.0;1.0;30.0;"Sorry, I will not ""buy"" this game due to the DRM. Figure it out already.";No thank you
76;21.0;1.0;28.0;Once you buy the game, you can only install it three times.  Ever.  If you get a new computer, there's one install down the tube.  If you so much as uninstall it to make space for a while, that's another install gone.  Use all three and you can never install it again.  Have fun with your rental.;I hope you never upgrade your computer...
5;22.0;1.0;28.0;Yes, they have infected this game with DRM. Online activation requirement and limited installs... the whole shebang. They keep on released these rental equivalents even though we, the customers, complain about it constantly here on Amazon and other places. This anti-customer attitude is appalling. In a few words, you don't get to actually own your copy of the game, but instead you get an install/time limited rental.\n\nSecond, this game does not have a save-anywhere feature. Instead, it uses with a checkpoint based system. This is quite peculiar because the PC version of the first Riddick game did, in fact, have this feature (and I didn't see anyone complain about it for them to remove it. Instead, devs were praised for it.).\n\nSave anywhere is an essential feature to any first-person adventure (and also RPG or RTS games), and the lack of it here simply portrays the laziness of the developers. There is no excuse for not incorporating a save anywhere function on the PC.\n\nStay away from this game. Instead please buy the original Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay (PC version). That one is an amazing game, and the developers should be ashamed for ruining the sequel.;"Two things: DRM, and lack of a ""Save Anywhere"" function."
6;23.0;1.0;28.0;I just picked up a copy from Gamestop, went on the website to find out where the game fits in the storyline and found out the game has retarded DRM (three activations no reinstall).  As someone who reinstalls his PC every 6 months or so, this is completely unacceptable.  I planned on playing this game more than once since I love the Riddick series.;Haven't played but returning it due to DRM
7;24.0;1.0;28.0;Unfortunatly this game is crippled by DRM [...], Atari does not seem to have learned the lession EA Games seems to have recently learned. You can only install this game 3 times, no deactivations, just 3 times as it requires online activation.\n\nUnless Atari fixes this malfunction, this is the last Atari game I'll ever purchase. I'd rate it 0 stars if i could, what a rip off.;Good Game, Bad DRM
33;25.0;1.0;26.0;Dark Athena is another game that I was considering purchasing, but after reading about the anti-consumer DRM, 3 activations, no revoke tool, I canceled any plans to own the game. Some publishers just don't learn. Any intelligent business would be able to look at EA's Spore debacle and think 'Hmm, that really hosed sales of their game. Maybe we should try a different approach.' But no, Atari marches on like the lemmings off a cliff.;Say no to DRM
80;26.0;1.0;26.0;The more you tighten your DRM, Atari, the more purchases will slip through your fingers.;Atari No Force

82;28.0;1.0;24.0;Game publishers need to stick with what already works which is to add to all their games excellent multiplayer modes in which to entice the player to purchase a cd key.  You can thank pirates for keeping publishers on their toes, otherwise they would shove DRM down your throats.;Down with DRM!
32;29.0;1.0;23.0;"Okay, I liked the first Riddick title.  It was a great game, and I played through it several times and still have the disc so I can play again in the future.  I've seen enough gameplay from Dark Athena to know I'd enjoy this game, but man, this limited install business is a deal-killer for me.\n\nThree installs and then call the vendor.  Really?  I game from 2 machines, desktop and laptop, at a minimum.  If I install it on my employers laptop to enjoy while I'm on the road for business, then that's 3 already.  Windows 7 is practically around the corner, so there's a 4th and 5th install for home.  I'll be rebuilding my desktop, and likely replacing my laptop over the course of this year, so there's a 6th and 7th install already, and we haven't even considering having to reload due to spyware infections or other failures.  Seven in the next year to year and a half.  Now then, I can gamble and hope that I can get someone at Atari (a company struggling to even exist these days) to deem me worth of some additional installs, but 4+ (could always get a new work laptop, making it 8)?  I'm not willing to take that gamble, nor do I feel I should need to.  T\n\nhis was another canceled pre-order for me.  I've had only three of those now: Spore, Alone in the Dark (first in the series I've simply skipped altogether), and now this title.\n\nGentleman, your DRM is killing you.  People are starting to come around to what a small minority have been preaching.  You are punishing your legitimate customers chasing those piracy numbers the been counters throw at you.  More and more, people are wising up and simply saying ""NO"".\n\nPotential customers looking to buy this game, consider this.  The economy is terrible.  When the economy was good, Atari were barely afloat.  Do you want to gamble that Atari will still be around to grant you, a paying customer, the ability to enjoy your investment a year from now?  Two years?  Companies that are cornerstones of our economy are failing.  Atari is very nearly renting games for 50 bucks +/-. That's not the kind of customer focus I'm looking for in a company I expect to weather the storm.\n\nI'm sure I'll pick this up once it's a 5-10 dollar title.  As I said, it looks like a great game.  This is of course assuming Atari is still around to activate my installs by then.  After all, it's just a coaster if Atari doesn't say you can play the game you purchased via online activation.";Sigh, not this mess again
90;30.0;1.0;23.0;So i am a customer willing to pay for the game but i just realized that pirating the game gives the pirate more value for free. Guess i will have to pass. Really sad, i really wanted to play both games, loved the original.;DRM install limit = lost sale
3;31.0;1.0;23.0;Once again, EA will kill sales due to DRM. Starbreeze, choose a different publisher next time. As usual this crazy restrictive DRM only hurts people who *buy* the game. The cracked and non DRM version is already available. I am beginning to think that software pirates are doing us, the *buyers* a favor by having the non DRM version for download. At least I can play this game next year on my new computer. Something this draconian DRM will not allow me to do.\n\nGreat game (that I bought!) EA will continue to ruin PC gaming with the DRM infected retail copies. Take note: Valve has done a great job of protecting their assets and IP by using Steam. I guess Valve just respects people who purchase their games.;Excellent game, crap DRM
70;32.0;5.0;20.0;As a fan of many Atari games, I was looking forward to this title. After researching, I found that Atari chose to limit the number of times the product can be installed, just like another game I purchased not too long ago, Spore.\n\nI have reinstalled Neverwinter Nights at least 10 times and love the heck out of it. I bought NWN 2 because the replay of the original was lots of fun.\n\nUnfortunately, Assault on Dark Athena will never have the possibility of being so much fun to cause me to enjoy this or any subsequent version that limits the number of times it may be installed...by me...the original purchaser of this game.\n\nJust like Spore, I played and had fun but don't even think about reinstalling it after a system rebuild because I can't plan on being able to use it regularly in the future. Bummer.\n\nI'd rather pay $15 a month for a game that I can play on any system for as long as I want than pay $50 for a game that I can't expect to install where I want, when I want. Now I'm even bummed out thinking about installing NWN because I know those days are gone for Atari products. I guess they will have to suffer financially before they realize how pathetic and weak this is.\n\nCool game, bad people at Atari.;Good idea, bad implementation.
41;33.0;1.0;19.0;"Dear Mr. Diesel\n\nI watch your movies. I play your games. I enjoy what you represent in these media formats, and I would consider myself a fan (barring the Fast/Furious movies - I don't like cars).

As is my personal policy, however, and in protest to the bizarre and frankly useless DRM restrictions that so many publishers continue to put in place, I will not be playing this game unless a DRM free version is released.\n\nI know that you don't have much to do with this end of the game, and that to some extent you are at the mercy of publishers. But I would urge you to prevent this from happening in the future. Until someone manages to make a DRM solution that is both effective and transparent to legitimate users (not to mention respectful of our privacy), severely crippled software such as this will continue to garner unfavorable reviews.

It is already cracked to play by pirates and they are going to hurt people who want to buy and support the game.\n\nAGain, what not adopt a simple Steam or itunes model (steam is per user basis, itunes lets you ""uninstall"" and activate a new machine).\n\nHaving pirated games 10x easier to use  is simply crazy.

75;36.0;1.0;19.0;I loved the original (on Windows) and was looking forward to this.  Sadly, I found that Atari has chosen to limit the number of times I can install this game.  Since I like to replay old games every couple of years, this is completely unacceptable.  They claim it's to limit piracy, but everyone knows you can just go download the game if you don't want to support the people who worked to make it.  But really, in cases like these, the pirates get the better deal.  I LIKE to BUY games in order to SUPPORT the work of the developers.  However, I refuse to buy games that I won't be able to play in the future.  Maybe if it were $9 it would be worth it with these limitations -- as it stands, no (pre-order or otherwise) sale.;A promising game.  But flawed by DRM.
43;37.0;1.0;18.0;I have dealt with the type of copy protection this game has. It is nothing more than a rental. If you upgrade your PC or buy a new PC after 3 installs you MUST buy a new copy of the game. This game also REQUIRES an internet connection even though it is single player BECAUSE IT PHONES HOME all the time.\n\nI have nothing against DRM, but any DRM that limits the amount of times you can install a game onto your own PC and constantly phones home is NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!\n\nIf you think a firewall will stop it, thing again, if you make your firewall stop it after several tries the game will simply shut down and stop working.;Renting a game is not acceptable

I feel really sorry for StarBreeze right now, but Atari has just shot everyone in the foot with this DRM plan. This game needs to be released on Steam and other safe digital distribution platforms ASAP (WITH NO INSTALLATION LIMITS!!!), and the disk version users need to be given a revoke tool immediately!\n\nAtari, you know what you have to do - we are waiting on an acceptable resolution.;Would love to play this game, but can't because of DEAL-BREAKER DRM
83;39.0;1.0;18.0;EA, I'd love to give you my money for this game, because I'm not a thief. Because you treat me like one, you ended up losing the sale anyway.\n\nSee how well DRM has worked? You're no longer losing money to piracy, you're losing money to people like me who don't want your intrusive software on their machines. PERIOD.\n\nYou lost a Spore sale to me based on this, and this game is now the same story. $100 from an honest customer, lost because of this bogus DRM scheme.;Congrats, EA! You're not losing money to piracy! You're losing it to companies who don't treat customers like criminals!
36;40.0;1.0;17.0;It seems like PC users get punished all the time for being gamers. It's not like XBOX-360 games don't get replicated all the time, or Playstation 3's for that matter. This is absolutely infuriating. God FORBID I reformat I hard drive more than a few times or change hardware. Why are PC gamers thrown to the side?\nExample: X-box live around 3.5 million users.\n  World of Warcraft over 11 million users.\nWOW alone has more users than all consoles combined. By the way I do own an Xbox 360, but over time, my PC has far outdone anything my 360 can do and I really enjoy the game improvements that are on PC versions of these games.\n\nObviously Atari could care less about the concerns of its customers and must believe their console sales will save them. Well heres some news for atari. I will not buy any of your games until this terrible DRM practice comes to an end. I also refuse to buy any games from any other software companies who decide to jump on this burning bandwagon. Really hope they decide to change this, I really the last chronicles of riddick game and YES I did pay for it.;What a disapointment!
46;41.0;1.0;17.0;Unfortunately publishers still don't understand that legitimate customers hate being treated like criminals and still force installation limits down our throats.  It's one thing to require the DVD in the drive or even an initial online activation, but to say I can only install this on 3 computers, well that's a little too much.  I have the money to upgrade my hardware every 8 months, and I do, so why in 2 years should I have to call a customer service rep and hope he/she believes me when I say I need a new key?

56;43.0;1.0;17.0;"I played Escape from Butcher Bay on the original Xbox a few years ago. That was a fun game. Unfortunately, Atari (a company that is already in terrible financial shape) has decided to saddle their newest release with a ""copy protection"" scheme so insane it's amazing they're even allowed to market the game as a product you buy.\n\nI'll break it down quickly: you are limited to installing this game three times, and once you hit that limit, there's no way of resetting the number. It looks like you'll probably have to call up Atari and beg them to reset your install count once you've used it up. And that's if you're lucky.\n\nThe simple fact is Atari is treating its paying customers like criminals and you shouldn't cop to them. Besides, someone's going to figure out how to pirate this game anyway... in fact, I'm guessing a lot of people will pirate it even if they could afford to buy it just to send a message to the publisher.\n\nLastly, Atari have been in a state of financial decline for some time now. They were delisted from NASDAQ a year ago. They could close up shop any day now. Then how will you be able to play this game?

Look to companies like Stardock, who made the Galactic Civilizations games with no DRM, sold for a reasonable price, and made money hand over fist.  DRM doesn't work, angers legitimate paying customers, introduces bugs, oh and as I mentioned, doesn't work to stop any form of pirating.;DRM is poison
54;46.0;1.0;16.0;I loved the first Riddick game, and I wanted to purchase this one. I started to think about it. I would want to replay the first game for fun before playing the new one. That should be fine since there is no DRM. Now fast forward several years to the future. Say I have played the second one and they are making a third game. If I want to replay the second one I have to prey the servers can still activate my game or I haven't played it to many times. That's even if the company that made the game is still around.\nSTOP PUNISHING PAYING CUSTOMERS! My money goes to companies that trust me.;Will they ever learn?
55;47.0;1.0;16.0;Well, I had to jump on the bandwagon of anti-DRM, having suffered from many problems in the past with DRM-related issues.  It shames me to think that a publisher, even after the EA/Spore fiasco, still tries to hamstring the legitimate owners of a game just to try to stop a percentage of piracy that has proven to not even be effective.  As a previous reviewer has mentioned, I'm sure that there are cracks already and that the DRM is already worked around for those intent on trying to own this game without having bought it.\n\nAs a consumer who enjoys buying and owning games, I have no choice but to not even consider buying something that clearly doesn't deserve my dollar, especially in an economic climate as dangerous as what we experience in our day and age.  Really a shame, too, since I enjoyed the source material and the original game enough to consider buying this product.\n\nPlease don't support DRM with your purchasing power.;Enough with the DRM!
58;48.0;1.0;16.0;Atari has taken the step of including a three install limit variety of DRM with AoDA. At this time, this DRM is non-revocable (meaning once your three installs are used up, you have a frisbee until you call Atari requesting more use from the product you have purchased). Worse, the packaging for the game does not in any way describe this system or make mention of it. Don't endorse this type of corporate practice - I have the utmost respect for the developer (Starbreeze), but the publisher (Atari) in this instance has poisoned an excellent product through this assumption that consumers are criminals.;DRM
64;49.0;1.0;16.0;With only 3 installs EVER, you are not buying this game, you are paying a hefty rental fee. If you format your computer and have to reinstall the game, upgrade OS and have to reinstall, whatever the case you only can install the game THREE time.\n\nThats unacceptable. I want to own this, not be controlled by some big brother.;You are not buying this, you are renting it
74;50.0;1.0;16.0;Remember when Spore came out with it's DRM?  Well this isn't any different.  Thanks to the DRM EA put on Spore, it quickly became the #1 most pirated game on the internet.  This will probably end up the same way.\n\nThis is just another company begging to learn a lesson the hard way.  Power to the people.;DRM is not acceptable
77;51.0;1.0;16.0;I didn't buy Spore because of the DRM limited install debacle. I now think twice about buying any EA games.\n\nWere you guys not paying attention?

47;52.0;1.0;15.0;This game can only be installed on your computer three times. Ok, fine. It's a rental, but at the full price of a regular game? This should be $5-10 as is if Atari wants to keep DRM in this game.\n\nQuite simply, if you purchase a game, you should be entitled to install it as many times as you want. DRM doesn't stop piracy. It only makes the experience worse for legitimate customers.\n\nSorry Atari, try again next time.;DRM is not fun
50;53.0;1.0;15.0;This game is absolutely a top flight title.  But once again, in an effort to kill the second hand market, a non-revocable DRM solution has been foisted on us.  Enough already.;DRM sinks another great title
69;54.0;1.0;15.0;First off, the game play itself is FUN and WORTHWHILE. And, it includes the original escape from butcher bay with VERY improved graphics. However, when I was so happy to buy it, I put it back on the shelf. Why? DRM. In other words, after you install it 3 times, you have to either A. Admit to yourself o.k my 'game' activation limit has exeeded and I cannot play the game anymore, hence the word rental. Or B. Bend over backwards and find the DRM authorized company and beg them, and show proof of purchase to re-activate. So, why the trouble? Just avoid the game. PC gaming is not dying because of pirates, but from publishers treating their paying customers like s***.;Why punish us?
79;55.0;1.0;15.0;I bought this product and returned it when it turned out that it was a DRM-ridden piece of crap.

Windows doesn't run slow enough that we have to put memory-resident trojan horses into games?\n\nI'm tired of being treated like a criminal.  After Spore, I said I would never buy another EA product.  Now, I'm tempted to say the same thing for Atari, as if Neverwinter Nights II wasn't enough of an unbearable clunker.\n\nScrew you, Atari, for treating your loyal audience with such unforgivable contempt.  The most ludicrous supposition is that this game is even WORTH pirating.  It isn't.\n\nSteer clear.  This product is defective by design.;Will they never learn?

This is the 4th game I've decided not to buy because of the DRM. It's sad that Atari has gotten on the DRM bandwagon. In there greedy attempt to fight piracy they most likely create more of it.

45;72.0;1.0;12.0;i can attest to this game being a fun distraction and holding its promises (if you ever played the old version of butcher bay you know what I mean). while the 2nd chapter doesn't have enough novelty and fun pacing and story structure (i loved that you did get your gun very late in the first chapter and it was much better explained why) it is still a nice twist and a good continuation of the story.\nbut if you are not a tech-savvy pc user I recommend getting the console version because of the horrible DRM restrictions.\nsecurom goes as far as not letting you play if you use virtual drives or have certain legal and widely used programs running. If you happen to have problems with installation (bioshock came to mind) you use up this limit very soon. and getting a timely response from atari support is wishful thinking, besides the extra cost in getting in touch with them. therefore don't buy this game and support hijacking of your pc and installing bloat and malware on an already vulnerable operating system (windows) that HAS to be connected to the internet for the activation to work.;broken game for a broken publisher model

This is really a disgrace for Atari; they are dragging a great name through the mud.\n\nI also thoroughly agree with all the complaints about the DRM and the 3 machine install limit, which is *not* stated on the box (at least in Singapore where I live).

21;84.0;1.0;8.0;"Well, I have been waiting for this game for a while, after reading about the limited 3 activations I was extremely disappointed. Atari, please read: Most PC gamers upgrade their computers right? You kind of have to in order to keep up with stiff system requirements. So when you upgrade your mother board you will need to re-install your OS, therefore ""your"" games as well. Some hardcore pc gamers I know upgrade their machines sometimes 2 or more times a year. I can't believe as a software developer you would limit activations to 3 times. By putting DRM like this into games you are not protecting yourself from piracy, you actually are encouraging it. I am sure there is a hacker out there that loves this series as much as I do, and you know as well as I do they will come out with a crack for this game. It is often easier for the consumer who legally purchased the game to hack it instead of dealing with the DRM. If your company was really being hurt by piracy then why was 2007 and 2008 record years for growth in the gaming market? DRM equates to nothing other than corporate greed! The following is a quote from an article on\n[...] ""Overall, the U.S. video game industry generated $21.33b in 2008, a number equal to 19% growth year over year. By segment, software sales were $10.96b, up 26%"". a growth of 26% is exremly good! So why do you need such restrictive DRM? Atari if you read this please post a comment to defend yourself. I would love to hear your rebuttal. If you were honest I guess you might say 'we are greedy and want to ruin the pc gaming market'.

Although I don't agree with draconian DRM requirements like limited installs I refuse to hurt the PC gaming industry more than is has been lately. This game is awesome first of all. It combines the remastered Escape From Butcher Bay and the new game Assault on Dark Athena, which are both excellent.\n\nThis game could be described as an action/RPG/FPS, where most of the action/shooting is done in first person, but there are dialogue choices and quests to complete. EFBB in particular is a masterfully crafted story. Although the remastered graphics are patchy at points, it's a game you play entirely on the edge of your seat. Assault on Dark Athena uses the same gameplay mechanics but falters in areas where it forces you to shoot or it forces you to hide. In Butcher Bay you always had a choice to hide in the shadows or kill indiscriminately. Still, it once again tells a very intriguing story, with two or three new satisfying and inventive weapons added into the mix.\n\nThe main gripe I have with these games is probably the bugginess. I had a couple of crashes, and some graphical glitches, but they weren't gamebreakers by any means. If you've seen any of the Riddick movies you MUST play this game, or if you havn't it's still a great play, they may even get you into the movies  (Pitch Black was way good but Chronicles of Riddick was so-so).;Two Awesome Games in One

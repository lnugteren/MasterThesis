1;31;352;0.8513636371012271;add list people eagerly awaited release game played sims ever since release first game also buying sims 2 sims 3 many expansion packs along way including 7 expansion packs sims 3 actually thinking waiting price come buying sims 4 since still actively playing enjoying sims 3 watching videos sims 4 playing around sim 4 create sim demo decided sims 4 seemed like enough upgrade want wait ignored fact sending pre release versions game bloggers review launch reportedly fears negative reviews would affect pre sales assumed afraid uber fans would mercilessly nitpick game anything line expectations known better based experiences date game warrants criticism coming someone gave base sims 3 game expansion packs 4 5 stars despite hype game takes steps forward steps back much like sims 3 unlike sims 3 m fully convinced yet improvements outweigh omissions know different people enjoy different aspects game m breaking review different components help evaluate whether you n ncreate sim build mode n ntrue marketing best parts game found improvement sims 3 terms re able customize user friendly interface makes however still aspects taken away unknown reasons total improvement said enjoy customizing sims building houses think enjoy updates whole create sim gone sliders instead sculpt sim like clay pulling pinching places sim adjust different parts appearance made 11 sims far clear much control even smallest details makes easier make sim capture someone likeness range completely distinct characters first method sculpting takes getting used played around prefer previous versions couple tips figured leave sim bald unclothed re happy sim face body shape sure adjust hair clothes removing made much much easier see full impact changes making still figuring new method making sims also helped remember rotate sim sometimes easier sculpt side angle vs front vice versa depending attempting previous games name sims give goal traits also new ways give personality control voice ability choose walk stride i e feminine bouncy swagger etc definitely another fun way make sim characters unique real said couple things noticed seemed like downgrade previous version outfits fun fashion forward seem pretty limited also seems way custom color different items i e hair skin tone use range patterns colors outfits also holds true build mode well love build mode easier shape house make way want control items like wall height miss able personalize houses colors textures n noverall interface n nin going sims 2 sims 3 found overall interface similar different increased customization game play meant menus overall everything seemed laid similarly case sims 4 looks feels dramatically different aesthetics standpoint layout menus look better intuitive experienced player sure initial frustration diminish time layout becomes familiar right changes intuitively feel like improvement change like current planned actions displayed particular easier understand sim multitasking becomes clearer talking group situations n ngraphics performance n ngiven computer specs great impressed game looks visuals definitely look appealing date sims 3 odd issues cursor disappearing hours game play changing screen settings able fix also weird routing issues sims say ca go somewhere even obstructions sometimes tend run sit top unintentionally annoying huge issue also crashed occasion overall long save regularly performance seem much better sims 3 game loads faster overall allude elsewhere review experience many bugs n ngameplay n nwith sims 3 gameplay felt game made biggest improvements sims 4 opposite quite honestly d created sims customized houses found rest game disappointment really looking forward addition emotions wanted sims would nuanced real seemed big affect game experience expected least game experience kind neat first appeal wore also new actions tasks kind thing found fun discover first lost novelty quickly careers also changed good change like unusual exciting quirky careers probably like new batch better maybe m boring like sims careers mirror real life mine often business medicine track sure saving university life expansion pack sorely missed also like least according experience playing date seems easier die sims 4 10 ways characters die electrocution hunger fire rocket ship crash landing old age overexertion cowplant embarrassment anger hysteria like kind quirky gameplay likely enjoy range frustrating see sim die embarrassment since seemed unrealistic makes hard create juicier story lines sim bit womanizer got caught gf children cheating mistress side n nbut probably biggest disappointment way world laid downtown portion city longer seamlessly integrated overall neighborhood want go experience load screen instead taking taxi driving etc destination thankfully load time quick even though running minimum specs game feels less real like definite downgrade maybe deal overall game performance issues admit game run much smoothly sims 3 d almost take little bit lag old layout back makes harder toggle family members home family members friend house town world general also feels tiny rich interesting sims 3 businesses visit much limited makes gameplay boring unless homebody sims though like one businesses included night club since good choice dates also fewer residential lots means fewer sims meet n nobjects buy mode n nlike sims 3 objects included base game pretty limited like dishwashers bunk beds sorely missed definitely clear want push people buy expansion packs stuff packs available 4th installment game m pretty used purchase expand play seems like sims 4 almost required enjoy personalizing home course help early adopter released yet n nso far m torn feel sims 4 given much game experience hyped standalone experience sims 4 pretty disappointing feels like fun part new game creating sim house actually playing doubt gameplay richer expansion packs released means enjoyable play experience ends rather expensive also requires wait expansion packs released even though think graphics sims 4 look better much prefer sims made sims 4 vs sims 3 m feeling bored sims 4 already feeling desire keep playing sims 3 content released mostly m feeling like shame ea maxis gave little incentive buy day one still anyway could see game would fun new sims franchise since

knock off entire sims series 2 different people companies made sims 3 sims 4 feels like entirely different game n n see people saying sims 4 end sim series makes sims 3 seem epic end game sims 4 comedic spin off series making fun laugh often playing sims 4 cartoony looks like barbie reminds early 2000 chicken little disney characters sim walk styles highly unrealistic way go small neighborhood area talking communicating expect go bar restaurants available order chips library see sims talking 24 7 entire time sims backs turned across entire room makes sense also supposed emotions sims really work replace thought bubbles sims 3 think sims 2 barely played m sims 3 fan sims longer thoughts apparently longer see thoughts non active sims either chats seem boring seem idea talking thinking thoughts aside chosing social controls see originally online game small areas travel loading screens emphasis game social interaction vs career progression skilling says supposed online social game like funny sounds club penguin sims 4 clearly aimed toward new younger players previous sims series games especially epic sims 3 never played therefore know anything better chat revert original social interactions choose back plain old chatting idea subject unlike prev games show unique personalities n nfurther sims 3 traits thought 5 many traits 6 university thought decent even simple plastic characters also create a sim basically un workable laptop click drag bodies could use sliders change sims sims 3 also far fewer choices clothing perks claimed trailers gone sims look un realistic ever make sim looks like neighbor friend even use click drag laptop mouse also made traits one sims 3 characters favorite sim typical good ambitious genius traits traits really play out sims 4 sims 3 click mailbox way donate good sims also unlike sims 3 good sims mean social choices angry sims 3 would never autonomously mean interactions wishes sims therefore nearly social reactions based bland 5 emotion options little variety less emphasis traits however sims 3 thought emotions thoughts individuality like real people comparision controlled bots feel sims 4 even say well cared sim happy sim needs high anything without player pets sims 3 sims could go lives without players story progression e g personalities choosing jobs obviously often would get promotions successful player sims 3 sims would react moods well sims 4 also could see close up feeling sims 3 sims 4 close look zen bland mood contrary little icon button claims particular mood sims 3 would show angry uncomfortable happy sims 4 show except looking social interaction icon top icon lower left emotions perk claim trailer also falls flat appear even fewer moods sims 3 aside little icon also life wishes replaced aspirations changed unlike sims 3 part unique personalities life wishes aspirations also less career based less emphasis careers skilling little connection chosen careers except want rich creative writer aspirations useless careers also far fewer items previously said buy includes items made improve skills longer telescopes replaced single microscope unique items skills except painting music athletics limited also descriptions items interesting funny opinion sims 3 little lore storyline sims 4 also bought better bed sim rather cheapest get rid bad bed moodlet still would get anyways even though description claimed uncomfortable items seem work claim n n open world story progression items buy realistic careers gone military medical field politics business law enforcement special agent could replace available sims 4 downgrade sims 3 fine creative sims really options seems storyline neighborhoods sims choose upon playing unlike previous sims games far could tell looking households travel see descriptions sims living information upon starting game prompted immediately create a sim let families sims sims 4 playing world incredibly smaller less layered options much anything plenty sims sims 3 could least visit bistro restaurant even grill eat out sims 4 times house extremely limited also since open world take classes skills cars previously stated reviewers even taxis either sim travels could find option cell phone going side lot disappearing highly unrealistic seems like different game said also select many items sims 3 fewer interactions objects available may see places screen re unselectable re limited small little area like pet pen since sims like pets players least storylines lore personalities n nthe social relationships seem unrealistic sim got tense 3 days without promotion happen sims 3 ambitious sim got argument nina caliente street also talking travis travis appeared notice disagreeing happened despite good mood later went sim house took trash notice random stranger sims greeted often walking inside sim house take trash ugh thanks makes sense know re outside going inside said sims seems like comical spoof sims series goes inside persons house also know take trash nina caliente 1 4 relationship meter red appeared notice insults went played computer hours left claimed thanks hanging red relationship meter insults friendly social interaction sim social meters seem relevance sims 4 sims 3 sim got argument another sim relationship became red would show would leave would take sim trash play computer say great time makes social relationships although sims emphasized seems rather useless without story line n n sims talk groups often sims 4 get stop blandly chatting instead unique social interactions based non existent personalities notice people standing around books crowding chess games little bothersome sim focus skill unrealistic crowd appear out of nowhere although seems skills lvl faster compensation entertaining first see crowded areas becomes passe quickly anything unique n nwhen game finally crashed hours frustrated would sims 3 since sims 3 complex interesting unlike sims 3 would often freeze show lag crashing warning sims 4 save peeved though hardly anything since characters unique personalities connection character created cared sims 3 wo played anymore look forward expansions want great game epic creative play sims 3 like adult satire child called sims 4 others said appears end great times sims series ea done simcity apparently 10 years mark end game series goes downhill ea go longer 10 years game series goes downhill becomes less complex interesting modders others many many ideas improving sims 3 increasing complexity depth previous games yet gone completely

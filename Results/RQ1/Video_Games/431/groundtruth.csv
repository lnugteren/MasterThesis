418;1.0;2.0;1824.0;"I've been a Sim gamer from the very beginning and have followed it the whole time. Rather than write a real review, I'm just going to give you my impressions. Do with them what you will.\n\n - **First and foremost, the game seems completely pointless**. I really don't understand what we're supposed to get out of this game that is so new and unique. Emotions? Yea...i guess those are interesting, but they really play less of a part than I expected. They're treated as an afterthought and more of an animated reflection of a character's mood than anything. It does change some actions every now and then, but since your moods/emotions are constantly changing...the whole thing comes off messy. Better hurry up and use that special action before your mood changes!!...oops, too late. Or, your emotions prevent you from doing something you want/need to do. Other than emotions, there is really nothing ""new"" that is overly significant as far as actual gameplay goes.\n\n- The game has reverted back to it's older style of gameplay. The Sims 3 was a step forward with it's open world, creative tools, vibrant graphics...all gone. This looks, feels, and plays like an up-scaled version of Sims 2.  Menus between traveling, very limited spots to travel to, no cars, no walks around town or to the beach, no clickable world map, no jobs to follow Sims to, no story progression...nothing. Your existence is so lonely in Sims 4...and dull.  There isn't even a ""town"" to speak of really, just neighborhoods. Again, I have no idea what it is we're supposed to be so excited about? The new create-a-Sim is pretty cool...but...unless you want to create an amazing looking sim (which is hard with the clothing choices at the moment) and do NOTHING with them...you're going to be disappointed. This feels very much like it started out as a mobile game.\n\n- Creativity is almost non-existent. Okay, so you can't make everything any color or pattern you want. That's fine, I guess. But it goes way beyond that. The choice you have for items is terrible. Sure, SOME items might have an extensive choice of colors, but most of the time its a multicolored combination. For example, if I wanted something in white/brown because one of those colors matches my interior...and it's not available...too bad. You'll have to choose the white/black combination instead. The choices in general feel like a bad beta test. **Try as you want, in this game your house can NEVER be exactly the way you want.** Let that sink in for a minute. At least 50% of sims gaming is designing a home for your sim.\n\n-  Remember how they kept saying how ""smart"" sims were going to be? Yea, they're not. My Sim wasn't smart enough to stop typing on the computer long enough to go to the bathroom. Does that sound ""smart"" to you? Are we really still dealing with autonomy like that 4 generations in? Yes, they can multitask SOMETIMES (the one noticeable improvement), but half the time you don't even know exactly what they're doing. My Sim was at the club and I had her go to talk to someone at the bar. She goes BEHIND the bar, and starts talking to the entire group. When i had her order a drink, she continued to stand there talking, and not even to the person I requested. I would think having smarter sims wouldn't require me to make essential choices for them, but it does pretty often. I also expected some of these ""smarter"" sims to be able to complete some of their ""wants"" on their own. They rarely do.\n\n- Shoddy Programming, glitches, and pathway problems.  Thats right, in addition to the terrible controls, pathways are STILL a problem.\n\n- I'm not happy this game is a failure thus far. In fact, I'm HEARTBROKEN. But, yes, that's how bad it is. I understand that some people like the game. I don't know why, but thats fine. Regardless, I feel like that is part of the problem. This game reflects the attitude of ""You'll buy it anyway"" and i cant stand that. This has such a huge following and is such a cash flow for EA that they don't even have to try. Here is a vastly inferior base game that will end up costing you hundreds more if you want to *really experience* and have fun with it.  I say enough is enough. For $70, I expect something worth my time from the BEGINNING.\n\n- I really could go on...but I'm not because I know many others will. Here is the bottom line, this is not a brand new game. This is a rehash of a time in Sims history that I thought had been left behind. This is step back. EA needs to decide if they want to make a cartoony time waster or a legitimate realistic life simulator. (Even something in between would be nice) They've had 14 years to get it right. Instead, it's just getting worse...and more expensive.";One step forward, ten years back...
149;2.0;1.0;817.0;"If you're a longtime fan of the Sims series like I am (from The Sims 1 up until The Sims 3), do not buy this game. And if you're looking to become a new fan and don't really know much about The Sims Series at all, just buy The Sims 3, you'll be much happier in regards to content vs. price, and this is concerning BASE-GAME MATERIAL ONLY, not expansions, keep that in mind.\n\nAnd this was after we gave it more than a few weeks worth of game-play in order to give it a fighting chance. That being said, people giving this game 4 stars and up are not facing the reality of how severely lacking this game really is (or are just new to the Sims series and know nothing about previous base-game Sim game content).\n\nThis being AFTER the patches with the pool/jobs when we checked it again on Origin. Plus this is coming from an optimist, someone who sees the good in life.\n\nBut in The Sims 4, there's barely anything worth liking. Not when I know what could be and what sadly is with The Sims 4.\n\nAnd if you are looking to buy this game but aren't sure, then by all means read this review. However for some of you who already ""like"" this game, I ask you to read the suggestions I made on page 02 of the comments section. It's a big downer for those who love expansive worlds, open creativity, and most of all options...\n\nFirst off: ""A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL GAME-PLAY ASPECT AND CONTENT REMOVALS"": http://ts4news.com/post/94541924952/89-features-missing-from-the-sims-4\n\n*I want you to keep in mind this is regarding only BASE-GAME content/gameplay only NOT expansions.\n\nNow onto the review:\n\nI played it with my siblings, and we returned purchase several weeks afterwards. Sure there are things that are good about it, but everything wrong with it completely overshadows the product. And let me tell you, it's not going to get better with expansions. It's severely flawed from the get-go and here's why:\n\nAll gameplay 'fun' must come from interactions. So for all you people who like to customize things, create beautiful awe-inspiring worlds, or just roam the land looking for interesting and unique activities in your town...you won't find it in The Sims 4.\n\nYou are mostly stuck inside of the home talking to other Sims, that's pretty much it. And it gets tedious. You cannot make your Sim travel to the end of your town and look over the mountains.\n\nThere are no mountains.\n\nIn fact, there are no more visiting your neighbors unless you want to get slapped in the face with a loading screen (which people will say are short and not too bad, but although they're short they are WAY TOO FREQUENT). And forget about watching your Sim jog from their house to the beach in order to observe that lovely horizon. Your Sim can't do that in The Sims 4, the loading screen is your enemy, and it will become pretty apparent after the 30th time you'll run into the loading screen that you'll miss that experience of watching your Sim drive down to the grocery store. So yes, freedom of travel is non-existent in this world, and boy is it a small world too.\n\nYour neighborhood is now only 5 lots.\n\nThat's right...5 (your immediate neighborhood is only five lots), the town is usually only around 20-something like Oasis Springs, a number FAR BELOW the maximum 100 you could do in The Sims 3 base-game (if you were bold enough to do that lol).\n\nAnd they're small/un-customizable 2D drawings. Yes, your neighborhood in The Sims 4 is a 2D drawing, not 3D, 2D meaning it's a picture you cannot move. Yeah, they really paid someone to draw your town rather than making it a dynamic 3D model like it was in ALL previous Sims games. And by 2D I mean it is an immobile digital image much like an Android phone game would be.\n\nSo yes, you would expect a life simulation game to at the VERY LEAST be able to somewhat simulate the real-world, but The Sims 4 simply doesn't. It's an incredibly poor excuse for a life simulation game, because apparently, life means staying at home in a 5 lot neighborhood, and that your 'world' is this sketch someone pasted onto the screen.\n\nSo yup, it throws you inside the house, expects you not to leave, and tells you you cannot change how the world looks. You are more or less trapped. And after a few weeks of gameplay, we were so frustrated by the lack of content and restricted gameplay aspects that my siblings and I returned purchase before the return-back policy expired. Do not wait after 30 days, you won't get your money back.\n\nAnd DO NOT WAIT FOR EXPANSIONS TO MAKE IT BETTER. This game is missing all the gameplay aspects that should have been included in the base game like The Sims 2 and 3 gave us. This game cannot give you some of these things even in future expansions because the game was created using software from the 1990s to early 2000s (32-bit software), meaning it is not physically capable of including some of these missing things.\n\nSo if you're a person who loves creating fun and unique items and Sims, traveling freely from one location to another on a large open world, The Sims 4 is the EXACT OPPOSITE OF THAT. And even then the world feels cold, like someone took items and threw them together without thinking how the feel of the area would be (almost as though the blueprint/architecture of the town wasn't planned out very well). It's an un-welcoming place. A place I don't want my Sims to be in. Hell, I even tried exploring the parks and looking for hidden items but even then the world felt empty and secluded from other parts in it.\n\nNow then, these are 10 MAJOR FEATURES THAT MAKE IT UNPLAYABLE:\n\n1. NO MORE OPEN WORLD. You are now secluded to one lot. If you want to leave that lot you will encounter anywhere from 3 to 20+ loading screens depending on where you want to go that all last around 30 seconds each (if you have a regular computer). For me it took slightly less but remember, you'll run into dozens upon dozens of those loading screens so it DOES add up.\n\n2. IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER BETTER THAN 32-BIT, YOU'RE SCREWED. 32-bit software is REALLY old and dated software, software most of us had in the 90's, so if you have a computer BETTER than that (like 64-bit like most of us have nowadays), if you play The Sims 4 (which was made with old 32-bit software) and install it you'll encounter an immense amount of glitches and software issues. Also, for some of you who might buy this anyways despite my warnings, for a few of you...this game WILL NOT EVEN INSTALL OR PLAY (if your computers have higher performance levels than The Sims 4 can handle). *They have a MAC version now (though I've been informed by other Sims players that it's just as buggy as PC).\n\n2. NO MORE CAS OR OTHER CUSTOMIZING ASPECTS. You can't choose varied hair colors, the color of their clothes, and different layers on hair or skin anymore, or any other color aspects and custom patterns like you could in The Sims 3. There are a few set colors, so if you want red but they don't have it, too bad...you also cannot add any unique patterns to anything anymore. So for you people who get pretty specific on what color you want your walls to be in or what pattern you want on your bed. You've got no other choice but to choose THEIR limited choices, so yeah, that was pretty upsetting for all creative Simmers out there.\n\n3. NO MORE DYNAMIC WORLD LANDSCAPES. There a very very VERY few terra-building tools. The Sims 4 world is a flat desolate place with little (if any) terrain variation. There are no such thing as mountains or changing terrain. You live in a place where it looks the same EVERYWHERE (and all background structures are just for decoration, not interactive like in The Sims 2 or 3 base-games).\n\n4. NO MORE CUSTOM LOTS LIKE MUSEUMS AND OTHER UNIQUE LOCATIONS. Lots are set by The Sims 4, you cannot create your own restaurants and other lots like that like you could in the base game of The Sims 3.\n\n3. ONLY 5 LOTS TO PLAY WITH (the immediate neighborhood is 5 lots, not the town to be specific, so yes the immediate neighborhood is not 40 or more like in The Sims 3). The game pretends to say that it make lots more interesting when in fact lots are so small houses completely take up the space, and forget about having an open backyard for a porch or anything like that. Your backyard is a tiny patch of grass, nothing else.\n\n4. NO MORE CARS. So for all you car enthusiasts out there. Sims walk and disappear from view to go to work. I'm not even joking. Cars don't exist in The Sims 4, and the ones that you do see are PROPS. There are also no more bikes and taxis. You cannot travel freely anywhere anymore. Your Sims have to walk there, get hit with a loading screen, etc. *Plus you may notice that Sims themselves will often walk aimlessly around the town with no set destination (in previous Sims games, you might see a Sim head to the diner and eat there, but not so much in TS4, there's a lot of a.i. glitches). I've seen a few walking blindly into the street and just stand there for hours doing absolutely nothing.\n\n5. NO MORE REGULAR JOBS AND WORKFORCE PEOPLE. Some of the regular jobs like medical are gone. Apparently...in The Sims 4, regular jobs don't count. And for some reason all repairmen, gardeners, firemen, etc. have been deleted from the face of the planet in The Sims 4. *Though there's a new patch for jobs, it is still painfully limited.\n\n6. NO MORE TODDLERS. Now granted not everyone likes toddlers (in real life), but in The Sims series, toddlers are fun characters you get to teach and raise and mold into scientists or other cool aspirations. The Sims 4 has no toddlers. You go from age 1 to 10 in one full swoop.\n\n7. NO MORE STORY PROGRESSION. Sims in The Sims 4 cannot move on and develop in their lives as independent A.I. like they could in previous Sims games. All Sims are dependent on your action, they don't carry out unique and interesting stories on their own anymore. So yes, no more awesome storybooks of their lives.\n\n8. YOU CANNOT MOVE LOTS. You can no longer move plots of land from one space to another. What you see is what you get, and it ain't much.\n\n9. ALL FUN MUST COME FROM SIM INTERACTION. So basically ANYTHING ELSE you used for fun in previous Sims games, like exploring, creating havoc, or free-roaming is a no show in The Sims 4. All fun comes from talking to other Sims, and even then it gets boring (because after a few hours, you will have already cycled through ALL their animations more than a few times).\n\n10. NO MORE HEIGHT VARIATION. Teens, adults, young adults, and the elderly are the same exact size. For some reason The Sims 4 believes people stop growing after turning into a teen and are all the same size as everyone else.\n\nThere are also no more Sim favorites, the elimination of certain public buildings (because Sims walk off screen to go to work, rather than going in a car like in ALL previous Sims games, there are also no more hospitals, schools, and certain work buildings). I can go on but you see the picture.\n\nWhat's there isn't worth keeping the game for, and what's promised in future expansions and stuff packs won't give you what you desire because The Sims 4 runs on old dated software that can't handle it.\n\nIn sum, this game is an overall failure. That may sound harsh but so is the 60$ to 90$+ (for the limited edition versions) that EA wants you to spend on a BASE game that's only 30% finished.\n\nSave your money people. You'd be glad you did. And for all the reviews saying this game is 4 to 5 stars, I can't even believe people are doing that. Please DO NOT sugarcoat this game. The Sims 4 is simply a game unfinished, not worth anybody's time.\n\nSo please, don't be blind to realities like those 4 to 5 star-raters are, really TRULY listen to the facts, not to those that are over-hyped about what they WISH could happen, and not what actually is...\n\n*Also I gave examples of an actual 5 Star Sims game listed in the NEWER comments on the 2ND PAGE under my name E.J. If that doesn't convince you, you are too far deep into the hype to see what's wrong here, and there's A LOT wrong. :/";The Sims 4: Everything You Wish HADN'T Happened But Did
406;3.0;1.0;715.0;"EA fooled me with all the frustration that came along with  SimCity and even to this day with Battlefield 4...yet I still purchased this game.\n\nI have played the Sims since Sims 2 was out. I've logged more hours playing the Sims than I care to admit because I love the Sims THAT much. This newest release, however, has left me extremely disappointed. What it feels like happened is that they spent all their time and money making the create-a-Sim an build-a-house features really, really cool. And then they ran out of time, money, or both and said just slap something together so we can get it out there and start making money!\n\nNow before I get to cranky, let me say what I like. The cartoonishness actually grew on me. I enjoy it. The build a Sim is very intuitive and has a lot more options for hair/better clothes (and tattoos!), however there are presets for hair and eye colors so no more customization there... House building is a lot of fun with a cool new option to add on 'pre-made rooms' EA built. You just pick the room you want and plop it onto your house, furnished and all. The job/school status tab is really neat looking now with lots going on. I actually don't mind that the game skips toddler mode, as I always just aged up anyway. The emotions are interesting, though I don't feel they should be the 'star' of the game, as it were.\n\nNow for my rant.\n\nOne of my very favorite features was the family tree where you could look back at all the generations. That, however, is now gone. In my book that's grounds enough for not buying this game. Shame on me for not doing proper research. After several hours of playing it becomes clear that the family tree concept was forgotten altogether... I have a sim have a baby and it says the baby is her sister. I have a son being romantic with his mother...I mean it's a little ridiculous.\n\nUnfortunately that is not where the disappointments end. No longer is there a city that you can meander through at your leisure. There are 'sections' of the city (basically the whole city is split into suburbs and then a downtown strip) and you can only visit one section at a time - now, keep in mind, these sections are TINY. In the 'lower income' section there are maybe 5 or 6 houses...and that's it.\n\nThe ""downtown strip"" section is TERRIBLE. There are only 4 or 5 city buildings and you have to go through a load screen EVERY time you want to enter a building. Oh...but don't worry, you won't want to enter any of them, because they picked the worst community properties to give us. There's a museum, a library, a bar and a gym and a park. No more city hall, no police, no hospital, no science center, no graveyards. I will literally never visit the 'city' again. There's nothing there for me and it's a pain.\n\nSome of the best careers are gone - replaced with some quirky ones that don't really make up for it (ie. the doctor field is gone). The money you make is minimal, and after working on a small family all day (real time) with two working adults in the household, it's been terribly hard for me to afford anything. I'm constantly at $0 and that's not even with buying a lot of stuff. Rent is just THAT expensive.\n\nEdge scrolling is painfully slow for whatever reason. Sometimes the keyboard commands work, sometimes they don't. Camera controls aren't intuitive. Just a mess.\n\nSo with all that missing...there's just nothing to do in this new version of Sims. I don't know what's more painful: the release of this new game or the fact that I actually paid for another EA disaster. To be honest I've put in enough time with this game until they get their crap together. I'm going back to Sims 3.";You fooled me yet again EA. Well played.
415;4.0;4.0;488.0;"It's been stated over on the Sims 4 forum that sims players who preferred Sims 2 are enjoying Sims 4, while players who preferred Sims 3 are not. While this is an oversimplification, what is true is that Sims 4 is currently set up for a play style that is a dramatic departure from Sims 3. Sims 4, like Sims 2, encourages rotational game play, where you play multiple households in a neighborhood and manually develop them. Sims 3, by contrast, largely encouraged focusing on one household, with story progression being used to develop the neighborhood as a whole. While you could play multiple households in Sims 3, it was less convenient--things such as saved wishes were lost without the use of mods whenever you switched households.\n\nSims 4 currently does NOT have story progression; it is much more like Sims 2 in that it encourages rotational game play. While it is not required (you have the option of setting other households to age up automatically), if you want other families to get married, have kids, etc, you will need to do this yourself. For some people, this is a big minus. For others, such as myself, it is a plus. I prefer building up an entire neighborhood to focusing on a single family.\n\nIdeally, Sims 4 will implement a form of optional story progression so that both play styles are accommodated. That has not yet happened, and it has not been promised, so if story progression is important to you as a player, I recommend sticking with Sims 3 for now.\n\nBeyond that, I have been having fun with the game so far. There are some minor bugs that I have encountered, but nothing game breaking. Create a Sim is fantastic--never before has it been easier to create beautiful sims with no custom content. The selection of hair is satisfactory, while I am pleased with the selection of clothing for a base game. Children look amazing; I did not like how they looked in the Sims 3, but in the Sims 4 they're cute, and actually look like miniature versions of their adult selves. Teens are the same height as adults, the only difference being smoother faces and slightly narrower bodies. This I'm less pleased with; it was done to save time, clearly, and the end result is three life stages (teen, young adult, adult) that are visually almost indistinguishable.\n\nThere are no toddlers; I am sure you have heard this by now. This has disappointed a lot of simmers, and I hope a toddler stage will be added in in the future. Babies cannot be created in CAS.\n\nWhat is also fantastic is the gallery. It has never been easier to grab sims and lots and bring them into your game. I spend a lot of time making my sims, but some people prefer to skip this stage, and with the online gallery it's easy to browse sims and download them into your game without having to exit the game itself. Myself, I'm not big on building, but with the gallery I can browse and download lots and rooms and move on to Live mode. The biggest drawback is the sheer number of downloads that are up in the Gallery. The longer the game is out, the more this will expand, and it makes browsing anything but the most popular downloads difficult.\n\nGame play is fun. It's a semi-closed world which means encountering loading screens frequently. The loading screens are fast, at least for me, and not something I mind terribly, but for some players it ruins the immersion. If open world is a deal breaker for you, then I recommend sticking with Sims 3.\n\nThe ""worlds"" (which are more like towns) are small, with a limited number of lots. The base game comes with two worlds, and each world has a few community lots, plus a park, plus a number of pre-built houses and a couple empty lots for you to build on. The small number of community lots is probably the biggest downside for me, but it is a base game. For the first time, however, sims can travel back and forth between worlds easily. In Sims 3 you could move to another world, but in so doing you would lose your relationships with any sim that did not move with you. In Sims 4, you can live in Willow Creek, visit Oasis Springs, and then come back, and the relationships that you form in either world remain intact. What this means is that expanding the game will be much easier with the addition of new worlds that cater to specific expansion packs.\n\nTo sum up, I am enjoying this game, but it suits my play style, which will not be the case for everyone. Before purchasing the game, do your research to see if it seems right for you. If you're on the fence, wait for the price to go down or for a sale, or check in on the game when an expansion or two has come out. For me, it was worth the purchase and I have no regrets.";Suits my play style, do your research to see if it suits yours
7;5.0;1.0;10.0;"The Sims 4 is a total joke.  I've been buying the sims games since I was a kid, so I was so excited to hear they were coming out with another updated version.  However, it took 2 hours to install on my computer (longer than ANY GAME I've ever installed), I had several problems getting the Origins program (junk and completely useless in my opinion) to cooperate including just logging in to it, and then was completely disappointed by the game itself.  I immediately went in to the ""create a sim"" and was enjoying all the new stuff, but when I actually went to play the game, it looked like something you'd see in Sims 1 (extremely limited possibilities if you ask me, probably the original sims is actually better than this one).  The sims 3 offered so many options, and the town was something you could go around in, but you don't get that option anymore apparently.  I played for about 5 minutes before I said ""nope"" and turned it off.  Sorry I wasted the money!";Worst Sims Game Ever
3;6.0;3.0;273.0;"For what it is right now, I'd rate this game somewhere around 3 stars. The high price for minimal starting content is where I was a little disappointed and it loses a star. I'm hoping once expansion packs start coming out, it will be a better game and rated more between 4 and 5 stars. The price for what you get right now is steep.\n\n I've been playing Sims since Sims 1 (The Sims). Sims 2 was outstanding. I played the Sims Online when it was up and running, and while I didn't love the Sims 3 at first, over time it grew on me and I learned to love it. There was just so much content for Sims 3 with all the expansion packs, you could play for days and barely get into everything available for the game.  There were plenty of bugs along the way, but to me the game was so much fun I fought through them anyway.\n\nI knew going into Sims 4 the game would be at bare bones again. No stuff packs, expansions, no new worlds, pets, vacations or college. No Sim horses to ride, salons to work in or pyramids to explore. However I didn't expect the Sims 4 towns to be as small as they are and with as few lots on them as there is. After the large open worlds of Sims 3, going to a small town in the Sims 4 is hard to adjust to. And the towns are even smaller than expected.\n\nSo since there isn't a lot of places to go yet in the game, you are left with the focus being on learning all the new aspects of how your Sims work and how to use all the game's new features.\n\nThere are 2 neighborhoods in which you can play in right now, Willow Creek and Oasis Springs. These two towns follow the same kind of set-up as Sims 3 towns, a main park for Sims to go to as a social lot, surrounded by homes and a few shops.  One big difference between Sims 3 and Sims 4 is the open world style of game is no longer used. Instead it's divided up more so into small groups of lots. You no longer travel across town by walking, driving or flying on a broomstick. You just put in the command to go to a location and you switch to a load screen, like the versions of Sims prior to Sims 3.\n\nThe positive thing I can see about going back to this non-open-world-design is the game should run somewhat better for those with computers with more minimal specs. The game doesn't need to have every home and every Sim in the entire neighborhood running at the same time. The town is broken down into small sections, and it's running just that section that your Sims is in. So those with less powerful graphics cards should be able to enjoy the game's graphics without having to turn them down to prevent crashing to their desktop.\n\nSims can now multi-task in a new way. Before, a Sim's version of multi-tasking might be gaining social with another Sim by playing chess with them. Now, you can play chess with one Sim and be holding a conversation with another Sim sitting somewhere else, like on a near by bench. It's more realistic in that a Sim can do more than one thing at once. Without thinking about it, I queued up for my Sim to go read a book after stopping in to use the bathroom, and instead my Sim went and picked up the book and took it to the bathroom as restroom reading material.\n\nThe traditional menus are still there, just rearranged a bit. You still have your Sims needs bars and skill bars. You can still adjust the speed of the game and can see your Sim's current mood. A nice tweak made in the game is that now Sims sleep MUCH faster. The game speeds up while Sims are sleeping to a speed far faster than in any other previous game. You no longer have to sit forever waiting for your Sim to sleep, even while at the fastest game speed. A whole night of sleep goes by in just a few seconds. More time playing, less time sleeping. A good thing!\n\nI do like how the new Create a Sim system works. I can make small detailed changes to my Sim much more easily than before. There is a decent amount of clothing and hair options available right now to get you started.\n\nThe Sims themselves look better, I think, in the Sims 4 than in Sims 3. The features are smoother and the clothing details are nicer. You can change additional features in this Sims, like how they walk. However I found that even if you set a walk preference, your Sims mood will also change how they walk or stand. You can set your Sims to walk with swagger, but if their mood turns to sad, they will walk around with head hung.\n\nThe moods of your Sim are one of the biggest changes in Sims 4. Your Sims current mood gives you various different interactions, it changes your ability to increase skill level and your Sims posture, facial expressions and reaction to other Sims. And your mood can be changed by the smallest things, like watching TV. When my Sims sat down to watch a romance on TV, her mood turned into ""flirty"".\n\nJust like the Create a Sim has some interesting new tools , so does the build menu for creating your home. There are new pre-styled rooms options offered in the build menu. You can search through a catalog of already designed and decorated rooms, buy the one you like and then stretch it to fit an empty room in your home. This makes putting together a nicely decorated house quite fast, and you know exactly how much you need to spend to get it looking the way you want.\n\nI did find a few glitches within the first few hours of game-play. Nothing major yet, but small things like my pregnant Sim was not able to complete the task of using the bathroom, taking a shower or making a meal, no matter what I tried. They would start the process, then leave it right away uncompleted. as if it was canceled out. So there are a few things that will need patched.\n\nI do like that the load screens are a lot faster. It use to seem like any time you saw a load screen in the Sims, it would be a while before you were back to playing again. Now the time between screen loads seems quite a bit quicker.\n\nWith time, patches and new expansion packs, I hope the game will have a lot more to offer. First impressions are that the game's current content is pretty minimal for the hefty price. I think they should have offered more content or charged less for what this game is so far. If you pick the Sims 4 up after it's dropped in price some, or after an expansion pack or two has come out, you will probably enjoy the game quite a bit more. It's not a bad Sims game, but it will probably be a better one in the future when there's more to do in game. I'm hoping it ends up being for me like the Sims 3 was, a slow start but with added content, a fun game in the end.";Has future potential, but minimal starting content and high price make it hard to love right now
369;7.0;2.0;226.0;After reading a lot of the reviews, I was going to wait for a price drop, but since Origin has it's Great Game Guarantee, I decided to try it out anyway. Needless to say after 13 hours of gameplay, I will be taking advantage of that return policy.\nPros:\nGraphics are great, if a little cartoonish. Game runs much more smoothly since it's only running a portion of the world at any given moment instead of all of it, which is a great plus for anyone who doesn't have the latest in gaming specs. Sims can now multi-task, i.e. reading a book on the can, eating your breakfast while paying the bills, socializing while performing other tasks like writing, painting, playing computer games, etc. You can even make out with the grim reaper and still write a romance story about it at the same time, pretty cool stuff. New emotions provide a new dynamic we haven't seen before, although it can be a little difficult to get the hang of it. Create-a-Sim system is so much better than Sims 3. It takes a few tries, but once you wrap your head around the mechanics of it, it's a lot of fun.\nAnd that's it. That's all I actually liked about this game.\nCONS:\n-The worlds are ridiculously small. As in around 20 lots, and 3/4 of those lots are residential homes. I think they tried to bandaid this by giving you two worlds and you can bounce back and forth between them, but the lots are essentially the same. A bunch of homes, a gym, a library, a lounge/nightclub, a park and a few other lots. That's it. And anytime you want to go anywhere aside from your neighbor's house, expect a loading screen. No more driving, no more taxis, no more carpooling, no more public transportation. You just use your cell phone and you're magically transported.\n-The careers. Oh my gosh, I think someone was on acid when they made these careers. I was actually one of the people who defended EA when they announced the new careers minus the old standbys like medicine, business etc. I fully expected to be blown out of the water by these new career paths. But instead, I was bored, almost to tears really. I tried out each path, but never made it past level 6 on any of them, because I just didn't care. Which is so weird because in every Sims game I have, which is pretty much everything, I've always been career driven and had to try them all out. But if it weren't for the fact that my sims needed money, I would have just quit and spent all my time socializing with other sims. You can still choose how you work, working hard, taking it easy etc. There's even a new option to leave early if you want, but you can't keep track of your sims emotions, needs or progress while they're working, it's all grayed out and I'm not happy about that.\n-The user interface does not make me a happy simmer. In each successive game, I've always been more than thrilled with the changes they made. But this time, it doesn't feel fluid, it's difficult to get the hang of, and there's really no logical sense to it. And the tutorial is the worst part, not only is it not helpful it's annoying. After it shows you the basics, it disappears and then magically reappears whenever it darn well feels like. I was on my third house, about nine hours into the game, by the time I got a tutorial bubble explaining emotions, which didn't even explain anything anyway. And I have yet to find an option to turn it off.\n-Emotions. You have a range of them, from happy, sad, tense, uncomfortable, angry and playful, to inspired, flirty, focused and energized. I think there's one I'm forgetting but whatever. Despite EA's claims of giving the sims emotional depth, this proved to just be mostly mechanical. As in if you're inspired, you can make better paintings faster, learn creative skills faster etc. And there's some corresponding reaction from your sim, if you're tired you'll slouch, if you really have to pee, you'll walk like a duck or whatever. But it's still not the emotional experience I was looking for. And you only get three personality traits. That's all, and there's really not much to choose from. Sims 3 had more emotional depth than this game does.\n-The content, or the lack thereof really. I was one of the few people who didn't think I'd mind the lack of a create-a-style mechanic in game. I never really spent that much time decorating anyway. But while I was creating my sims, I was really disappointed by the limited hair and skin color options. Plus, I wasn't too thrilled with some of the color schemes of the clothes, and the fabric choices made a lot of them seem washed out. I also didn't think I'd miss toddlers. I dreaded that childhood stage in Sims 3, and couldn't wait until they aged out of it, but after watching a couple of babies pop out of their bassinet and magically become children, I couldn't help but be disappointed, not to mention I was flashing back to the original Sims game. The toddler stage added a depth to a sims growth period that was lacking before and I didn't realize it until I lost it.\nIn conclusion, I will probably purchase this game again in the future, after a major price drop, and after a few expansion packs have been released, and it's on sale. It's not a bad game, but I've played Sims from the very beginning and EA has set the bar pretty high, and they fell short this time, and when I say short I mean, they didn't even get anywhere near the bar, in fact I think they aimed for someone else's bar. The content you're given does not equal a 60/70 dollar price tag. It doesn't even rate 50, honestly I wouldn't buy this game for any more than 35 bucks, and I'd have to be in a pretty good mood. I remember purchasing Sims 3 at launch and I could not stop playing for days, literally, I actually called into work sick one day because I stayed up until 5am playing it. I played this for a few hours and I had to force myself to keep playing because I kept hoping it would get better. Yeah, it didn't.\nThis game feels like they took Sims 2, redid the graphics and UI and tweaked the aspiration system, and slapped a Sims 4 sticker on it. This is not the game I waited 5 years for. Guess I'll have to wait another five years for Sims 5 and content myself with Sims 3.;Sims 4 is really Sims 2.5
5;8.0;2.0;147.0;"There are certain elements of this game that I like. HOWEVER, the amount of sacrifices that were made for these new features are not worth it.\n\nOn the positive side, the graphics have received an update. It isn't a drastic change, but it is refreshing since The Sims 3 was beginning to look dated. The animations are a huge improvement too, which is good because the robotic feel of TS3 was very annoying. I also found the game to run very smoothly on my computer. No lag whatsoever, on a slightly-above-average PC.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good ends. The major selling point of this game, emotions, feels like a gimmick to me. And it certainly does not make up for all the things that have been removed.\n\nThe new controls and UI are horrible. It took me almost an hour to get a feel for the controls, and right now it seems like a huge downgrade. The edge-scroll feature is broken to the point where I have to use the WSAD keys to move around. The UI has been dumbed down so much that it impedes gameplay. This is particularly true with Build/Buy mode, and i fear that new players will be lost trying to build their first home.\n\nColor customization has taken a huge step backward. We no longer have control over the color wheel and custom patterns. Instead, we are stuck with whatever presets Maxis has decided to include. There seems to be a lot of options with furniture, but Create-A-Sim and Build mode are severely lacking. Hair colors are the worst off. While the hair styles themselves are great, there needs to be more variety with the colors. Since Maxis removed such a huge feature from TS3, I'd expect them to give us at least double the amount of color options.\n\nThe world sizes are too small. I actually don't mind that they replaced the giant open world with smaller, connected worlds, but there simply are not enough lots. There are two connected worlds, each with 16 residential lots. Considering how the original Sim 3 town had 90+ lots, this is a mess. While I technically won't have 32 lots running at the same time, i liked having a variety of lots and OPTIONS in my game. I usually have 10-12 families running at a time, so after 2 generations, I will have already used all the lots in the game. A third (connected) world is GREATLY needed.\n\nThe biggest offender, however, is the lazy approach to life stages. Toddlers are gone from the game entirely, while teenagers have been given almost identical models to their adult counterparts. It is very difficult to tell the difference between the life stages, aside from children. Toddlers need to return, and a preteen stage needs to be added to make up for these ""adult"" teens.\n\nAlong with these missing features, the game is riddled with smaller instances of cut corners and lazy design. The game needed at least another year of development.\n\nI have no doubt that many of these problems will be fixed in the future with expansions and patches, however I am not sure the current base game will be able to keep me occupied until then. While i certainly look forward to future fixes, I am not happy with the current state of the game. It provides some entertainment, but after a few weeks I may be back to The Sims 3.";1 Step Forward and 2 Steps Back
345;9.0;1.0;131.0;"I am still in shock that I was so excited for this game to come out only to be so disappointed.  As others have said, a good description of how I felt after a few hours of playing is ""heartbroken.""  I hadn't been keeping up with any of the development, I just overheard someone saying it was coming out the next day and got excited and bought it.  I expected this game to be a well-refined version of the Sims 3 with more emotions and new hobbies and things to craft.  But this game plays like it was written for a tablet.  I've tried to summarize my experience.\n\nThe first thing that disappointed me was CAS.  I realized you have to change the appearance of your Sim by clicking and dragging, which can introduce a lot of variance into what you are trying to do.  The hairstyles don't look as real as they did in the Sims 3.  It is like they are all wearing plastic wigs like the Wiggles.  Then I noticed there are only a few preset colors for the outfits which leaves no room for customization.  Why wouldn't something as simple as a colorpicker be implemented in a large scale simulation game?  Even Microsoft Access has a color picker and it's for databases!  But CAS isn't why I play the Sims so I just kind of grumbled and brushed these things off.  Nothing a few good mods can't fix.\n\nNext, I'm seeing a 2-D image with the outlines of clusters of buildings.  Slightly confused, I picked one of them to buy.  (I didn't find out until later that was actually the map.)  So now I'm feeling a little skeptical, but my house loads up and I start trying to play.  Woohoo!  The first thing I did was try to cook some eggs, but I can't quite see and I can't get the camera angle to move vertical.  It only moves left and right and zooms.  Great.  So my sims are eating eggs and I also can't figure out where the hell the Needs are, or any other info about them.  Instead of everything being in a cluster in the lower left hand corner, things are split on each side of the screen.  This is absolute hell with my Eyefinity setup.  Half of my Sims stats are 6000 pixels in the other direction.  But this isn't the first game to not support Eyefinity so again I keep trying to like what I am experiencing.\n\nAfter eating I go try running around and came across some harvestables, and some rocks, Awesome!  But I get to some water with fish and the cursor is crossed out.  You have to click on a sign with a fish on it that is on land in front of the jumping fish to make your Sim fish.  Why does there need to be a sign instead of just clicking on the fish?  Then it gets really upsetting.  My camera won't move so I zoom out wondering why can't I scroll past here?  Then it hit me that this was a border so I moved all around the neighborhood and yep it was basically a giant rectangle limiting me to three houses and their yards.  What the hell?  I press 'M' to bring up the map and BAM! the 2D picture with the clusters of buildings.  All the pieces come together.  I click on one that looks like a Park... LOADING SCREEN.  So..  No more jogs down to the library?  No sending my Sim out in the woods on a 3 day fishing trip?  What is the point?  Just to walk around a flat rectangle until I have to pee and shower again?\n\nThen without even thinking, as kind of a reaction you would have to seeing something horrible, I closed it out and went straight to Origin and got a refund.  At the time I couldn't even believe I was actually going to ask for my money back.  But to me it was like opening a box of Monopoly, and only finding Chinese Checkers.  The few little perks, emotions, and the eye candy that this game adds only pale in comparison to the functionality and freedom that has been lost when compared to the Sims 3.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting this game, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO.  Go to Origin right now, buy the Sims 4, and play it.  Then you will see for yourself, and you have a 24 hour window to get your money back.";It's like opening a box of Monopoly only to find Chinese Checkers...
375;10.0;1.0;130.0;"It's said quite frequently when the subject of nixed content comes up that it cannot be expected that a brand new Sims game can be as fleshed out as the previous incarnations in all their expansion pack glory; I disagree.\n\nThe Sims 4 is a ""core"" game in a franchise that has been wildly successful and around longer than kids born in the 2000s. It has plenty of added features and is created on a brand new engine that is designed around being as smooth and accessible as possible, even on the lowest end of computers.\n\nSo why am I giving this game a zero?\n\nI think most people are confused as to what an expansion pack is supposed to be. An expansion was a way for a developer to continue to develop updates for a game. The process of patching new content for software that's already released costs a lot of money and resources. When you purchase an expansion pack, you're paying for the team to continue to patch in new content.\nExpansion packs for video games should be considered just that. A patch that elaborates upon the core game in a way that completes the experience.\n\nBy ignoring content they've already released into the franchise; they've made the base game smaller and bareboned. They've ignored all the iterations they've released of their software. Yes. The game runs very well. (minus a crash or two I've received with the autosave function being non-existent despite the claim that it's implemented) It looks fine, but it's full of archaic loading screens;\ninvasive saving, and several design choices that boggled my mind to the point where I simply couldn't continue playing.\n\nThere's such an exceptional amount of customization to a Sim's body and face-- very few complexion changes (every Sim ends up looking like a barbie), limited make-up or hair colors.\nEvery Sim ends up looking the same with one of the 21 total male hair styles or the slightly more extensive 25 female hair styles.\n\nTeens, Young Adults, Adults and Elder are all the same height with very few differences that place them apart. Why even have variation?\n\nThe neighborhood system is very restrictive. Under the current system it's completely possible to run out of lots to place Sims. In fact, if you want a new neighborhood for each family you make? Can't happen. They all exist parallel to each other in the same neighborhood.\nAnd I.. just the jobs and what happens when your Sims are on different lots from each other.\n\nAny game should be an evolution of it's previous iterations.  This one attempts it giving it fresh paint and a new engine; but almost all other features are either stripped out or downgraded.\n\nI spent 60$ USD on a complete experience and instead of getting Microsoft Word I received Notepad.";An incomplete experience
385;11.0;1.0;125.0;"Just another way to take our money. I swear, I was one who had sworn off EA after the broken nightmare which was SimCity. I don't know what I was thinking giving EA more money. I guess I'm just a glutton for wasting money.\n\nAll these reviewers have said it ""This is a port for their expansions, so they can nickel and dime you to death"" there is far too little in this game to be enjoyable. The career paths are boring, and for the first time in a Sim's game, I can say, I don't enjoy it.  When the first Sims came out, I couldn't put it down, and even it, had more content than this one.\n\nAll of us here are long time fans of this game, how did they think we would react to this weak offering? Shame on you EA. I'm glad there are some people who are enjoying this poor excuse of a game, but the rest of us aren't. You charge us $60.00 for a game like this, in an economy like this?  I think you owe us more than that. And no, we don't want a free copy of another one of your crappy games. You better dump free content for this game on us in spades.\n\nEven then, I doubt you will do right by your customers.

192;12.0;5.0;106.0;"I don't know what game most of the reviewers here are reviewing, but this review is for the Sims 4.  Having read many of the reviews before purchasing, I decided what most complained about I wouldnt mind, and that I still wanted to see for myself.  However, I was in for a shock when I started playing, for the game appeared completely different.  Here, I will try to list as many of the pros and cons as I can, generally in relation to Sims 3, other times to Sims 2.\nIn my personal opinion, the game seems much more intelligent than the previous games; it seems more realistic; and it seems they tried to meet many of the requests that lots of people had been asking for in a sims game since Sims 2.  Many people said this game was a step backwards and did not offer any significantly new upgrades in technology.  However, I found the exact opposite.\n The game-time has been slowed just a bit.  It is now much more reasonable and sims can take a shower, go to the bathroom, and eat breakfast in the hour before going to work or school.  It fits, actually, about perfectly, and once they are done doing those things it is usually exactly time to go to work (or school).\n If you do not pay your bills, rather than a repo-man coming (as it was in the other Sims games), your utilities get shut off one-by-one.  It gives you a warning about this when a bill arrives.  Curious to how this would play out, I let the sim not pay the bill.  You only have 24-hours to pay it.  After that 24-hours ran out, the electricity turned off.  This turned made all electronics unusable, forced all the lights to be off, and wouldnt allow cooking with a stove (which apparently must not be gas stoves).  I let him still not pay the bills, and a day later the water turned off.  He could not take a bath or use a sink (unfortunately, I cant remember now if he could still use a toilet).  I then had him pay the bills, so I don't know what would have happened next.\n When you send your sim for a jog, rather than clicking on where you would like them to jog to, you click on the sim and there is (always) an option to go jogging.  When you do this, the sim jogs for a while and then turns around and jogs back to where they started; sometimes, if they can, they will jog in a circle instead (such as around the block).  If you felt that jog was too short, you can click on them again and have them jog again (push the limits, it says), and they will do a much longer jog the same way.\n If two sims are headed each others way so they block each others path, rather than stop and wait forever (to likely begin moving at the same time to have to stop and wait again), one of the sims simply steps to the side for a brief second while the other continues walking smoothly; once that sim is just a tiny bit past the sim who stepped to the side, the side-stepped sim then continues.  This generally takes a second or less for them to complete, and looks very smooth and natural.\n Sims can really multitask.  They can do almost anything while eating, drinking, or reading.  They can have conversations, answer the door and invite someone in, watch TV, and even do something on their phone while eating, drinking, or reading.  While eating or drinking, they can do even more, such as paint or play cards (with painting, they hold the plate in one hand and a brush in the other, taking pauses to grab a bite).  They also do not stop eating, drinking, or reading when you tell them to move someplace else or do most things; they will even read on the toilet if you tell them to go while reading!\n Cooking sims can have conversations with other sims.  In addition, sims conversations don't have to be locked; they don't need to face each other or stop what they are doing to do almost every social interaction.  Unless the interaction requires physical touch (and even sometimes when it does), the sims do not need to face each other.  A sim who wants to give someone cooking a compliment can simply give it to him/her while walking past him/her from behind.  Everyone still behaves right and reacts to it, the cook looking back behind his/her shoulder to the speaker.\n Contrary to what I had read in many reviews, the emotions in the game affect everything.  The way the sim talks, behaves, and walks; whether or not they will do something you told them (tense sims might cancel-out something you told them to do; usually, if you tell them again, they will do it).  The way they talk to people is changed, and what should be a happy chit-chat can start making their relationship grow sour if the sim is angry or tense, which makes them speak snappily and rudely.  Emotions can change the socialization options, also, giving you knew ones you didn't have without that emotion.  The emotion options are vast; I don't think I have encountered them all yet, and each emotion has stages (such as basic, very, very very).  Emotions can also affect how well they learn a new skill, how well they do something (like cook or woohoo), and how long it takes them to do some things.  Sims can also feel multiple emotions at once, but usually one emotion is stronger than the others and is the one dictating the social options.\n It is a partially open world.  It is true that the game has to load to go to peoples houses, but it is not true that it is like Sims 2 where you have to stay on their lot or have a loading screen.  Sims can freely leave their house and wander around, collecting things like rocks, flowers, and mushrooms, and interacting with other people who are also wandering around.  Once you approach a house, though, it will make you load to enter it, but the loading is not even a minutes wait.  The game also has the worlds separated into districts.  You must load to go from one district to another, but within each district you can wander around freely.  Its my own personal opinion that this makes it easier for machines to run; I know for my own computer it runs much more smoothly than even the base Sims 3 game did, and I think its cause its not having to load the entire world constantly.\n There are two worlds presented, and your sim can easily travel between the worlds and does not loose anything from doing it; it is treated just like traveling to a district or a house.  NPCs also travel between worlds, so while it is apparent that some are supposed to call home only one of the worlds, you might occasionally see them in the other world, apparently visiting.  The two worlds are a fantasy-like woods and a New-World-style desert (with cacti and everything).\n The game has finally added tacos as a meal to make at home, and also has chips-and-salsa to eat.  I don't know about you, but I had been waiting for that (which never came) in Sims 3.\n Unfortunately, there are no cars.  There are cars driving in the streets, but none for your sim to drive.  Since both Sims 3 and Sims 2 added cars later, I going to assume thats what they will do, but who knows.\n Sims do not take taxis everywhere; they walk.  This is made tolerable by the loading of districts, so you don't really have to wait that long for them to get anywhere, despite walking.\n Once everyone in the house is asleep, the game goes into this super-super speed that I cant seem to access manually.  The first-digit of minutes go by like seconds, so that an hour is more like a minute.  You don't have to wait very long at all for them to finish sleeping because of this.  It automatically stops and goes to whatever speed you last had it at when someone wakes up.  You can also tell it to go at a different speed if you don't like it buzzing by so fast.\n Sims can sit on the sides of beds, like they do on sofas, and can do all the normal bed-interactions from the edge like that.\n All of the loading screens are very fast.  It saves in less than a minute, too.  The Sims 3 was never as fast as this game for me, in terms of loading.\n In making outfits, rather than have each outfit category limited (and requiring some real round-about skill to recategorize an outfit if you wanted it in a different category), each outfit category has a filter.  It is automatically set to its own filter; each top, bottoms, or outfit is tagged for certain things.  So, if you go to make a formal outfit, it automatically brings up everything tagged formal.  However, you can click to remove that filter or change it to another one.  What that does is lets you have access to all of the clothing for all categories.  You are no longer restricted in this.\n Hats do not come with hair; they can sit on top of any hairstyle, and the hair simply morphs a bit to fit the hat realistically.\n If you give a sim multiple outfits for one category (so far I have given four just for everyday, but there is still a plus-sign to add more), they will automatically rotate between their outfits each day randomly.  So every time they shower or wake up, they will wear a different outfit.  Because it is random, it may have them wear the same ones a couple days in a row, but it is usually a different one.  This applies to all outfit categories.  You can also still tell them to wear what you want by clicking on them, so if they put one on you don't want them to wear, you can simply tell them to change.\n There is no toddler stage.  Infants grow up into children.  However, you can interact with infants a lot more, but as far as I can tell cannot carry them around.  They sit in a carriage, and you can go to the carriage to interact with the baby.\n Sims gain a skill instantly when doing something that requires that skill.  The skills seem to progress faster than in other games, but not by an extreme amount (except for that first immediate one).  Sims can try to read skill books of any level, but if it is below their own level, it will make them feel bored, and if it is too advanced for them, it will make them feel confused.\n The face and body creation is very detailed.  You can really change their body shape and face shape.  Unfortunately, there is no color wheel, and you must select color slots for eyes, hair, and skin.  However, their skin colors are decently varied and numerous, though only have two fantasy options: green and blue.  Before working with a face you will need to pick the shape you want for each part out of a selection, and then go from there.  This changes things like whether the sim has an eyelid-fold, whether they have a cleft-chin, or  how long their lashes are.  After that, you can morph the face like crazy by pulling it around (no sliders).\n Again, no color wheel for clothes, furniture, floors, or walls, either.  You are limited in your choices.  Each item does have choices, but it is still more limiting in this area than Sims 3.  If you are big on architecture or interior design, you will probably be disappointed with this game.  They have made house-building easier and faster, but have not catered to architects at all.  Thats fine for me, as I normally just used pre-made houses, but may be terrible for some players.\n The skin of sims changes what it looks like depending on their fitness.  Muscular sims will have muscle definition.  Skinny sims have visible bones.  Overweight sims have rolls.  The skin fades into each other, so that a muscular skinny sim has both bones and muscle definition, and someone neither skinny nor overweight has neither bones nor rolls.  However, someone who is both muscular and overweight will have rolls.  These are sliders, and so the skin slowly changes as their fitness does in the sliders.  I assume this would change in-game, but haven't had a sim change enough to notice a difference.\n Mannerisms, behavior, and speech change depending on age.  Children behave like children, fairly playful in mannerisms and behavior (or more tantrum-like if upset); young adults behave and speak more like real young adults (at least in the US), adults behave and speak more maturely, and elderly behave and speak very maturely and often with an air of authority.\n You can select a walking style for your sim from a selection of rather goofy walking styles.  This will be how they normally walk.  You can also change it later at the dresser in plan-outfit mode.  However, their emotions can affect their walk, too, so the walk will still change sometimes, but most emotions will not affect the walk you chose for your sim.\n They have made it extremely difficult to change a sims surname.  If your sims marry, neither sim will change their last name, and there is no way in the game to change it.  You must use a cheat.  After Ctrl-shift-C, you have to type in testingcheats true, then cas.editfullmode, esc to exit the cheat bar, and then shift-click on the sim you want to change the name of, select modify in cas, and then change their name there.  This is very frustrating and probably the worst part of the game that really needs to be fixed.\n If your sim goes to talk to someone who is already talking to someone else, the other sim will not stop talking to them, and so your sim will enter a broader conversation.  In some cases, it may say your sim is talking to six or more people.  However, individual conversations can still happen here.  Whoever you click on is where your interaction will be directed towards.  If you click to give a flirty joke with some sim named John, everyone will laugh, but only Johns relationship with you will be affected.  This applies this way for everything.  However, an in-general chat will be going on with everyone, though some sims your sim doesnt know may be skipped (your sim may avoid conversing with a sim they don't know who is talking to someone they do, in some cases; loner sims seem especially inclined to this).\n Unlike what I read in three different reviews, sims do in fact take care of their own needs.  Unless you have them fishing or reading, they will automatically go to the bathroom, feed themselves, bathe, or have fun if you ignore them for a few seconds.  Sometimes they will while reading, but not as easily.  There is an option to turn autonomy off, but normally they take care of themselves unless you tell them to do otherwise.\n Sims get up a little before having to pee their pants, giving you time to tell them to go to the toilet (or for them to choose to on their own) instead of them waking up to simply pee their pants.\n Sims automatically flush toilets that haven't been flushed before using.  No idea what slob sims would do.\n It is true that story progression is not around.  Other sims do not change (they do not get married, have kids, get or change jobs) unless you go to play them and make them do the changes.  However, everyone still ages at the same rate.\n The game allows for multiple accounts on the same computer.  So, you and your partner or children could each have your own version of the game.  You log in to your own portion of the game that has your own saves.\n It is true that the hair selection is limited, but from what I remember it is a bit more than what Sims 3 started out with, but I may be wrong on that.  It feels especially limited for the males, as usual.  Males also have less full outfits to pick from, and still no dresses or skirts.\n Work stories, like done in the Sims 2, are back.  While your sim is at work, a window may appear saying something is happening, and you have to select what you want your sim to do.  I have found in the Tech occupation it is awfully repetitive, having seen only two stories brought up multiple times, but I suppose it is better than nothing.  You can tell your sim how to perform at work or school by clicking on a corner symbol on their picture.  It is possible for sims to be in different districts, and you can kind-of control what the other (that you are not with) is doing by their picture, or you can switch back-and-forth between them.\n Sims can put things like plates on bookshelves.\n There are no cookbooks/recipe-books.  There might be one for $2500, not sure (it is titled as a cookbook).  This is a bit disappointing for me.\n With infants, breastfeed is an option for females (at least the mom, have not tried other females).\n One weird thing is the sims love to play musical chairs.  They tend to get up and switch places a lot, and I haven't figured out why.  They also tend to just get up and down.  So a sim eating breakfast at the table may suddenly decide to stand beside the table to eat it, but last minute decide to finish it at the table (or not).  Two sims eating at the table may constantly switch seats while eating.  They don't do this every time, but enough that it seems weird and almost annoying.  Thy also play musical chairs at the bar, but don't seem to have a problem on sofas or when sitting on the bed.\n Occasionally, seated sims (no matter where seated) will get up and reset.  This has only happened when many people are seated and talking to each other.  It happens rarely, but it is very strange, and I have not figured out why it is happening (in part because it happens too fewly).\n Woohoos can be good or bad (often based on the emotions they felt while doing it) and how good it was affects their mood after.\n Pregnant sims do not change clothes.  They keep the clothes they had while pregnant, and you can still change their clothes.\n You can change hairstyle and makeup in plan-outfit mode, along with clothes.\n Long periods of cleaning trigger a very tense emotion, which claims to be caused by so much cleaning.\n One really annoying thing is the game saves every single notification.  It tells you when your sim has left off to work, when they have returned and how much money they earned, when they level up or do something else; and saves it to a long list.  It also groups the lists of all sims you have played together.  If you do not delete these as they come, the game will eventually run out of room and tell you it has.  You then have to go deleting them one-by-one.  If you stay on top of it and delete them as they come it is not as bad, but this is still a very annoying feature that seems like it could have been done better.\n You can alter any lot while visiting it without having to leave your game.\n How much babies are fed determines their weight when they become children.\n Their selection of idle behaviors is a bit limited, because twice I saw sims have the same idle at the same time.  This is a little annoying as it reminds one that it is a game and makes everything else seem more fake (I don't know how else to describe it).  However, most of the time it is fine.\nOverall, the game seems more realistic.  The pros, for me, outweigh the cons.  While being more realistic, it is also very playful and goofy; if you are into very seriousness, then that might annoy you in the game.  (For example, when sims are happy, they go around with the biggest smile on their face.)  If you like more playfulness in games, though, it may delight you (as it does me).  I was lucky enough to have bought it after the patch was released which fixed all of the bugs.  EA has never been known before to actually fix the glitches in their games (at least not for the Sims), especially not so quickly.  Im taking that as an indication they are going to try to have better ethics this time.";I don't know what game others are reviewing, but this is for the Sims 4
417;13.0;1.0;102.0;I can't even begin to express how disappointing this game is. I first started up the game at midnight last night when it was released. I was impressed by the sound quality and by how fast the game ran. Loading screens were short, too. It immediately plopped me into Create-a-Sim, as if I were making a character for a single character game such as Skyrim or Dragon Age. That was different.\n\nI immediately went into options and noticed something disturbing. There were almost no options for anything except graphics settings. The Sims has never been the best at providing a decent options menu (e.g., no custom keys) but this was even worse. You'd think they were trying to IMPROVE the game.\n\nAfter this foreshadowing of what was to come (lack of options!) I started creating my first Sim. I was very excited for this Create-a-Sim that included dragging facial features to adjust them but honestly it was disappointing. Not only is the color wheel gone, but the colors selections are boring and horrible, especially for hair and skin. I can't say that there are too few hairstyles and clothing options because that's how it was in previous Sims games before expansions/DLC and mods. The face adjustment is a -slight- improvement over sliders but it really does NOT give you the ability to create more unique sims! It only makes it easier. It is VERY limited. For example, I was trying to adjust eyebrows and found that it kept putting a limit on how far I could move them up/down/out etc. It was extremely annoying.\n\nI finished creating my sim with his clay-like hair and entered the game. This is where things got even worse. There are not only two neighborhoods but they are TINY! When I play the sims, I like to create a lot of them. Usually 20-30 of them, such as a few families and a lot of singles that I love to interact with and see who gets paired off, who stays single, etc. There are so few lots that I couldn't do this now. The grouping of lots and constant loading screens are annoying. There are so many things missing and not just what you'd normally expect from a Sims base game. I was bored within 2 hours. All that TS4 did was make me want to go play TS2 and TS3, which is exactly what I did after a few hours.\n\nThis is really a step BACKWARDS. When you make a sequel to a game it should be an IMPROVEMENT, removing or fixing previously bad/extraneous features and adding new ones, not dumbing everything down. For example, The Elder Scrolls series. Although Morrowind was arguably better than Oblivion, Bethesda always tries to add MORE to each new game. From Arena to Skyrim, the series has improved each time, with more graphics, better dungeons, more content, better combat, better music, better modding opportunities, etc. (Minus the always prevalent BUGS.)\n\nEA could learn from Bethesda. Stop making your sequels worse. Make them better. ADD to the game. Fix what was wrong with the previous games. Don't take away the things that people enjoyed and give them very little in return!\n\nSave your money on this one. Save it for the potentially awesome titles coming out in the next 6 months - the new Civilization game, Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire remakes, Dragon Age Inquisition, Pillars of Eternity, Tides of Numenera, Borderlands... Don't spend your $60-70 on this!;Made me appreciate the Sims 2 and 3 even more
402;14.0;1.0;101.0;I've been anxiously awaiting the release of The Sims 4 for quite some time. I was recently made aware of the missing pools and toddlers but I've been playing The Sims since the beginning so I decided I wasn't going to let that keep me from giving this game a shot.\nAt last the game has arrived! I get on to play and start creating my sim, the create a sim tool is great, I mean it's missing some simple things from TS3, like body hair but no biggie. So finally, I'm done creating and I get to start playing... Select a house? Okay, but why is this neighborhood all divided up into sections? Well... you can't simply travel around the neighborhood like before. What, are you joking? No! Remember what it was like in TS2? It's like that, loading screens to travel to and from a lot of places. Meh.\nFine whatever, let me just go get my usual job in the business career and it'll all be good. Nope, you can't do that either, sorry! My Sim just vanishes into thin air, I can't see his needs or anything while he's gone. There are many other things that I've found missing from the game compared to previous versions.\nWhile the emotions of the sims are an interesting addition to the game, they most certainly do not make up for the all of the things that are now missing. The graphics in my opinion are only slightly better than before.\nI remember the day the first Sims came out, I was glued, for hours and hours. It's only taken me about 3 hours to get bored with The Sims 4. Keep your money and stick with The Sims 3, you'll be glad you did.\nI'll probably be returning my copy tonight via the Origin Great Game Guarantee because in my honest opinion, the game is a very stripped down version of the Sims 3 that is not worth the price tag.;Stick with The Sims 3
338;15.0;1.0;93.0;"I am always trying to look on the bright side of things, and even when I heard what features had been left out of the Sims 4, I still thought, ""That's okay!  They'll replace it with a cooler feature, right?!""  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.\n\nI gave this one star because the Create a Sim is amazing.  I love the push and pull navigation of it.  Other than that, the game is ridiculously boring.  I had blocked off my entire Tuesday night because, like I had with the first three, I expected to be gleefully playing in the computer room until 1 am.  Instead, I grimaced at the screen and attempted to play for about an hour, while slowly and more frequently going, ""Ehhhhhhhhhhh"" like Tina from ""Bob's Burgers.""  I actually found myself playing with my phone while playing the game, in the same manner that you play with a phone to try and end an awkward conversation with someone.\n\nMy optimistic self keeps thinking, ""Well, there's potential, right?  The expansion packs will make it better, right?"" And then I have to remind myself that I just paid sixty dollars for something that I am not happy with, and I'm trying to make an excuse for that.  That's EA's biggest con of all - not the fact that they have put out a bad product, but that we are secretly trying to make excuses for why it is so bad in the hopes that it will somehow get better next time.\n\nIn conclusion, the game plays like a bad iPad app.  If that's the extent of the work you were going to put into this game, EA, then bravo, you got me to buy a sixty dollar app.";Like a Bad Blind Date...You wanted it to be good, but deep down, you knew it wasn't going to be
413;16.0;1.0;91.0;This game was very rushed and it appalls me that this game was actually going to be released in early 2014 before the delay. I shudder at the thought of what it would have been like 6 months ago. This game is missing everything that made the sims so great.\n\nCons:\n\nNo classic careers like business/medical, etc.\nNo cars.\nNo pools.\nNo toddlers.\nNo create a style.\nVery little customization options to make up for the loss of create a style. (Like that shirt, but not the color? Too bad. You're sticking with the puke green color, pick a different shirt.)\nCamera controls are awkward.\nBabies are objects.\nNo open world.\nThe world is small and very flat.\nNo story progression.\n(These are just SOME of the missing features/problems.)\nWhat's up with the ridiculous price tag for this abomination?\n\nPros:\n\nEmotions\nSmooth gameplay\n\nUltimately, they made way too many sacrifices to give us very little in return and it just didn't pay off in the end. They took an entire different direction with the franchise but went about it the wrong way.\n\nIn short this is a very watered down game that took 10 gigantic steps back from what used to be a great franchise. If anything, it's a sequel to Sims Social, not the sims 3.;Wanted to like this, but it's impossible. They completely destroyed it.
6;17.0;1.0;82.0;"I played with the Create A Sim demo and felt I had a good understanding of it, but once I started in the actual game the create a sim setup has no natural path. Despite having the tutorial, (which if you click off of it goes away until you randomly do whatever it asked you to do.) It assumes you know what to do, and it tries to empower the user with ""freedom"" and flexibility, but instead you end up missing parts like changing body parts. You see the dials for muscles & fat, but clicking on the body parts and adjusting them at different angles? Well I hope you intuitively know where they are and what their abilities are b/c there is nothing to queue you to their functionality. Again I've been playing with the CAS demo extensively, but in the production version of the game there is no natural flow.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that there is far less control in general. You have only the pre-determined styles and there's no room to custom or alter ANYTHING.\n\nLike that shirt or counter top but want to make it a shade lighter? Too bad! You get these 5 options we've created.\nWant to make that metal object, wood? #SorryNotSorry\nWhat a design on that lampshade? So long as it's white, sure!\n\nThere are 1/20th selection of anything, except random crap you don't care about. There are 6 counter/island styles, but 19 stove hood styles. Seriously?\n\nStandard things are missing. Like? Dishwashers. Under counter, trash compactors. Classic double kitchen sink. Not-hanging ceiling lights (i.e. standard flush mounted can lights)\n\nThe new mouse/camera controls are weird. You can change them back to Sims 3 style but since you're missing pitch/tilt it doesn't make much sense.\n\nI am so frustrated by the complete lack of *everything* I rage-quit while setting up my house. Something that I could do for hours in all previous versions.\n\nI spent nearly all of last weekend in The Sims 3, making a really cool new house. Making sure that the wood of the bedroom furniture was the same style and color. Pulling tones from bed fabrics and using them in curtains and wall colors. Making sure the metal of the kitchen counter knobs was the same metal and hue as the light fixtures and the appliances.\n\nAll of the subtle details that made The Sims 3 a fantastic customizable world are COMPLETELY lacking in The Sims 4.\n\nThey completely screwed up the worlds too. Instead of having a cohesive world, you have the vague notion of a world with out of scale venues in neighborhoods. In order to go anywhere or see your world you have to use your phone. Instead of getting in your car or summoning a taxi you go to a load screen and appear at the venue. You cannot seamlessly travel within the world only in the neighborhood. I feel like I am using an internal alpha and not a released game.\n\nWith the Sims 3 I loved trading patterns in the Exchange and getting new buildings or furniture that would have new patterns that I could customize and apply in existing buildings or clothing. I loved being able to choose that SPECIAL shade of green for my Sims eyes, deep green but vibrant. I missing selecting hair color and adding subtle highlights and low-lights.\n\nI've spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars, buying every expansion pack, every new world, every stuff pack and new set and venue in The Sims 3 store.\n\nThe entire reason I loved playing this game, the customizing of houses, and furniture and clothes and the people ... all of that has been decimated to what can only be described as bare bones, poor-mans replica.\n\nI want to throw money at EA like I did with The Sims 3, but until I can change the shade of purple in a shirt, or matchy-match my furniture, I have no reason or desire to. I am heart broken that the newest version of my favorite game is only a shell of it's former glory.\n\nAll of that is gone, and until it's back, I am too.\n\nSo disappointing.";Complete disappointment! Do not buy!
408;18.0;2.0;70.0;Well, I pre-ordered this game and eagerly anticipated the arrival on the release date. I got my package as expected through amazon..right on time (I love Amazon!).\nHowever, I was extremely disappointed when I put the disk into the computer - I was expecting to be able to start playing after a couple of minutes installation. All the installation does is take you to origin, where where you have to wait to download the game. I'm probably not even going to get to play today because it is taking so long! (I timed it and got out the calculator...it's going to take about 5 hours.) The entire reason I bought the hard copy version was so that I would not have to wait for the game to download. I called EA customer service about this and the girl was very polite, but she really didn't have any answer for me. She said that the game wasn't on the disks, that I have to wait for it to download. I asked her what was on the 2 DVD disks that I got and she didn't really know...just files or something. ?????? Anyway, I am disappointed in the format and in the amount of time this is taking to download. Don't bother buying the hard copy version...just buy the download...and be prepared to wait 5 hours for it to download on origin anyway.;Don't bother buying a hard copy!
414;19.0;1.0;68.0;"first thing this morning I set out to find a Sims 4 and spend $60 on what I'm sure is going to be an amazing Sims experience. Not at all - it's horrible, there is literally nothing for your sim to do - four businesses - 4! and two little towns that don't even sport the same coastline or graphics that sims 3 did. I am so disappointed I already called the place I bought it from to learn of their return policy -  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Buy Sims 3 and spend $60 on the expansion packs if you want to enjoy sims. This game has maybe 1/10 of the features sims 3 did I'm so sad...\n\nUpdate: Now that I have played a bit I wanted to make my review a little more useful. Once I figured out that the simoleons cheat shift+ctrl+c then type motherlode worked I was able to create my dream house and I did enjoy that, I like the new wall heights. But I think the problem for me is I just enjoyed sims 3 too much. I loved the fully open world and having more community lots - with a beach!! - and being able to create them. I also liked the sims going to work in the game and actually having some involvement in that. There is none of that in this game your sim just disappears and the career choices are less and kind of odd. There is still culinary and one or two seem like they could be fun once or twice like astronaut or painter but I miss the tried and true career tracks. I liked going to the grocery store and picking out ingredients. Now you click on your fridge and you purchase the ingredients according the recipe (based on your skill level), I also miss taking classes, and a completely customizable home and style. I am really disappointed that given the game is supposed to be SO centered around emotions - WHY do I have so few personality traits compared to Sims 3??? Eventually I feel like I'm creating the same family over and over. I would still return the game if I could because I just don't care for the ""emotional sims"" as much as I did the other features that are now missing. I remember the transition between sims 1 and 2 seemed huge and I was hoping that Sims 4 would be everything the fans love about Sims 3 but improved with better graphics and new and improved styles and objects -but this is not the case. The game feels like it was meant for a console and I don't care for the cartoony sims and flat neighborhoods. Also if the game is supposed to be fun after you learn hours and hours worth of techniques and tips - then EA provide us with a manual and not make us purchase one separately. That all being said I really hope the game is fulfilling to others who like the new format. Personally I feel like this game is a total departure from what was so great about The Sims originally.";... Not an amazing Sims experience
425;20.0;1.0;68.0;"I cannot believe what a huge step backwards this game is.  It looks like a Facebook game so please do not waste your money.  It looks worse than both The Sims 2 and 3, and is buggy and glitchy.  Most glaring are the huge clipping problems - Sims walk completely thru each other, furniture, and objects.  There are a lot of dropped interactions for no reasons.\n\nThe toddler life stage is completely gone, and babies (which are objects that can go into inventory) age up to children, just like in The Sims 1.  The world is closed, not open, and there are loading screens every time you change lots.  No cars, either, Sims teleport everywhere.  Poof.  I can't believe how many features EA removed from this game.\n\nIts really boring after a few hours.  Don't forget you can get your money back from Origin with their ""Great Game Guarantee.""

393;21.0;1.0;67.0;"Does EA Games understand that when they release a sequel, there is an expectation that that sequel will surpass the game that came before it? Apparently not. There is no point to this release except to make the company more money. They ensure that by including virtually nothing of interest in this base game, so that if you want anything even remotely interesting you will be forced to by the multitude of expansion packs yet to come.\n\nThings I don't like:\n* Awkward and unintuitive controls.\n* Cartoony-looking sims.\n* A weird, closed-off feel if you're used to playing Sims 3. You can't drive, bike, jog, or walk anywhere. You can't even cross the street to say hi to your neighbor. There isn't even a neighborhood (such as it is) view, except when you use your phone. You can't even go home without using your phone. Apparently your phone is now some sort of teleporting machine - one that leads directly to a loading screen.\n* No pools. No toddlers. No dishwashers or trash compactors. Seriously?\n* The teeniest, tiniest ""neighborhood"" you can imagine.\n* You don't get to pick your own wishes for your sims anymore, removing that aspect of developing your character through those wishes. Now your sim will decide what he or she wants. You're really not necessary to the process. How is this a game again?\n\nThings I do like:\n* If you can play Sims 3 on your computer, you can play this. The graphics look the same, and they've removed so much of the fun stuff that this game should run quite easily.\n* I love that sims can now socialize while doing something else. That was something I really wanted to see added. I just didn't know I'd have to give up everything else.\n* It loads fast. It's not much fun once it is loaded, but at least it is fast.\n* I also love that finally the community lots (all five of them) are busy. It got really old going to hangouts in Sims 3 just to discover two or three people there. At most.\n\nOverall: I'm still sticking with Sims 3. I can't live without the open world now. Going to Sims 4 after playing Sims 3 reminds me too much of Flowers for Algernon.";Not a fan
363;22.0;2.0;60.0;"If you never played Sims 1/2/3 before and just want to have a taste of the series, then you might enjoy Sims 4. There are certainly some nice things in this new installment: Building a house is now easier (with the sacrifice of some creativities though); the game loads faster than Sims3 with lower computer requriement; Many of the new animations are quite well done(e.g., cooking); the facial expressions on sims are more lively; also IMHO Sims4 sims looks better than in previous versions. So for sure this game will keep you entertained for a couple of days, or maybe weeks.\n\nThose being said, I still believe the price is steep for what it offers. For $60 I am expecting a lot more, or else I prefer the money spent on other big titles (like the new Civ game). Besides, with the same amount of money you can get Sims3 + most (if not all) expansion packs, and EA just offered the complete collection of Sims2 for free a few weeks ago. I guarantee that you will get much, much more fun out of these.\n\nFor long time Sims fans (like me), I would definitely not recommend this game. During the first few hours of gameplay, I found myself discovering more missing features from Sims1/2/3, rather than enjoying the new features (not too many) that Sims4 offers. Sure, I've heard about the lack of toddler/pool/open world and I'm mentally prepared for it, but still there are things that caught me as surprise. There is no dishwasher and recycle bins, no fireman (though we do have fire alarm, but what for?), no nanny either; the maximum lot size has been reduced to 50x50; adding more windows won't make your room brighter; your sims can no longer paint portraits; quite a few objects (like some high end beds and computers) are locked until you fulfill certain requirments (which doesn't make any sense to me). The lack of changing the color/texture of any furniture is sad, because as usual, EA don't provide you furniture sets with matching colors. Also I really hate the ""teleport everywhere"", more than I thought I would be. The loading screen takes about 10 seconds on my mid-end computer (Intel I7, 8G memory, and a decent graphic card). Not too bad, but still longer than my liking, and I'm afraid it will get worse after a few EP installed (which I'm not going to buy though).\n\nMany people says that things will be fixed/improved and new features will be added. But seriously, for how many years and how much more money? After going through that cycle with Sims 1/2/3, I don't think I'm ready to do it all over again at this point.

9;24.0;1.0;19.0;Zero stars. If they'd paid me to play it I'd still feel ripped-off.\n\nMy main interest in Sims 3 was building houses and making characters. I found out Sims 4 lets you move houses around on the lot instead of rebuilding and that you can have different wall sizes and better character-design controls, and with all the bugs happening to Sims 3, I decided to try Sims 4. Wish I hadn't. With no ability to customize anything at all (clothes, furniture, items, etc.), I only used it twice, for about an hour each, and then never had a thought of clicking on it again. Last week, cleaning out unused programs from my computer, I saw it. I'd entirely forgotten I even had Sims 4.\nIf you have infinite room on your computer and infinite time for searching, you can find custom content to download, but it's such a waste when Sims 3 would let you click on something and make it exactly the color or pattern you wanted.

409;25.0;1.0;51.0;"For the first time, EA/Maxis has actually ruined a game completely.  There are no steps forward, only sideways, and there are several steps backwards.\n\nFirst of all -- extremely limited.  Transitions between areas of town have returned, disrupting game play and diminishing the feel of story.  You can make your Sims structurally different (except still no changes in height), but not much more so than Sims 3.  Less change in clothing and hair coloring than Sims 3, which diminishes any perks to the graphics upgrade.\n\nThe controls are labored and difficult to get used to.  The ""emotions"" perks aren't that much different from the other positives you gained in Sims 3 -- this is the step sideways.  Mini-game additions to dating is annoying, while the mini-game addition to the careers are actually a nice change.  So, some adjustments worked, but not across the board.\n\nIn the end, I honestly would skip Sims 4.  Sims 3 is better in gameplay, options, and story construction.  The graphics upgrade is not even worth it when everything else is cut away.\n\nWithin two hours of play, I was deeply regretting buying this game.";"Skip Sims4; not worth it"
379;26.0;2.0;49.0;I am still in shock. Last night my husband downloaded the game and I was stunned. Not in a good way. The graphics are boxy and outdated. It is actually more cartoon like than Sims 3. The towns are smaller with very few choices for homes, or lots. When I say small mean, like, really small. Like 2 lots. The free roaming town of Sims 3 is gone and you need to load for every lot you go to. Loads times are significantly faster, I will give them that, but the free roaming town made Sims 3 feel more realistic. Build mode was basically the same, but with a few new  things like Crown Molding. You can now chose from premade rooms in build mode. Just plop down a few basic rooms and viola, you have a basic house furnished and everything. Perfect for those times when you just want to get into playing with your Sim and not fuss for hours over a house, but still like a more custom look that the houses available. I enjoyed this feature a lot.\n  Disappearing Sims is back, like in Sims 1 your Sim just vanishes when he goes to work. Not a huge deal, but it all comes back to how realistic Sims 3's towns were with actual businesses for your Sim to work at. The multitasking, and new AI for the Sims is spectacular. How spectacular? Eating dinner while watching tv...you satisfy hunger and fun at the same time. Read and poop. Yes, your Sim can read and poop at the same time. You can really create a Sim with a personality and that personality has consequences...I liked that part. But customizing your sims wardrobe and furniture took a step back with the removal of the Create-a-style tool. Now you are back to 1 or 2 pattern choices, and half a dozen color choices if your lucky. That was such an awesome tool, I have no idea why they would remove it.\n\n  I'm still playing the game one day later which means I didn't use my 24 hour window to return it. Guess I'm hopeful that some things will improve over time. I enjoy the new social aspects of the sims very much, but I have doubts as to how long it will hold my interest. Expansions should come soon and cheap, if they want me to continue paying for content. Otherwise I'm afraid this is the last Sims I will play.;Former Sims Fan

I didn't follow the pre-release hype and development cycle because I've learned that this tends to create undue anxiety and, often, eventual disappointment. As let down as I feel, I can only imagine how it's been for those who kept tabs on this product with deep anticipation.\n\nI don't even know where to begin. Yes, the create-a-Sim feature, in which you mold the shape of your character with direct manipulation as opposed to sliders, is fun and intuitive. And yes, the graphics and emotions are well done and nice to look at (though this series is continuing a trend toward a sillier and more ""cartoony"" universe than the original and relatively ""realistic"" feel of the earliest games, which I personally find kind of disappointing). But somewhat better graphics don't matter much when the gameplay feels so truncated, and the much hyped new emotions feel like more of a surface gimmick than anything to compensate for the lack of other (in my opinion better) features that existed in prior games.\n\nI only played the game for a few hours so I admit that my review isn't very deep, but all I can tell you is that my initial impression was one of apathy. The basic ""Sims"" experience of controlling little virtual people is still enjoyable, but it's a stripped-down and kind of awkwardly different version of the experience. I've loved this series since the beginning and felt that each entry added significantly to its predecessor. This one does not. Worse, it goes backwards. I'm not judging the game against what previous expansion or stuff packs added, I'm judging it against what the core editions of Sims 2 and Sims 3 added. So much more control and depth was added with the second game, and of course the third game's primary feature was the implementation of the beloved open-world neighborhood feature. But now? We're back to isolated neighborhoods (with strangely few households). We're back to magically teleporting to work since not only are there no job locations, there aren't even any vehicles. Sims are more autonomous which means that they take it upon themselves to do more things that need to be canceled out and also seems to give us less reason to play in the first place since they do so much on their own (I always liked to set my Sims' free will to ""low"" so they would only act independently in case of emergency, but I didn't even see such an option this time around). There are also less needs to take care of- something admittedly introduced in the third game- but when coupled with the fact that Sims can now multitask, their maintenance sort of becomes convenient to the point of...well, pointlessness. I'm spending more time watching them do things than telling them what to do.\n\nAnd that's not just because of the level of autonomy, it's because there's simply less to do. There are less locations to visit. The neighborhoods are smaller, so that also means less neighbors. I don't learn about other Sims getting married or having children because, well, as far as I can tell they've gone back to no longer doing so. There are less objects to interact with. Fewer choices of things to buy. Fewer ways to design my home. No color wheels. No ability to customize furniture or create styles. The interface is completely different, the controls feel clunkier and less responsive, the building interface is dumbed down to the point of being restrictive, and there are loading screens any time I want to go somewhere. I don't know what to say. With this entry in the franchise playing The Sims has simply become less FUN.\n\nThe game runs pretty smoothly (no doubt because there's less stuff, less going on, and every location seems to exist in its own individual ""world"") and again, the game is very pretty on the surface. But when the meat of the experience feels so much emptier, especially after the massive strides of the last two games, what does it matter? What difference do pretty graphics, smooth framerates and cartoony emotional interactions make when after an hour or so you're spending less time feeling immersed in a fantastic virtual world and more time taking notice of the barriers, removals and restrictions that you're constantly being faced with? I've really tried very hard to resist entering that cynical territory where I say that all of these things are surely the result of EA's desire to simply sell us back all of this missing and reduced content in the form of expansions and stuff packs that will drive the total cost of the game into the hundreds of dollars, but I feel that there's simply no other explanation.\n\nI'm not even going to complain about this cycle. I can't, I knew it was coming. Unlike the previous entries in the series, which did remove some things but also introduced massive new additions and gameplay overhauls in exchange, The Sims 4 really kind of seems like a bold-faced challenge that tells us right upfront that the game isn't a step forward, it's a step backward, and defies us to resist re-purchasing all the content that we- and they- knew should have been there to begin with. And if the patch history of Sims 3 and PR scrambling of SimCity are any indication, anyone who ignores all of this and buys into the experience is going to be in for one long, headache-inducing ride.\n\nThe Sims was a great franchise. It may continue to be. I don't know. I rushed out to buy each of the previous base games in this series when they were released. This time, I merely played it for a few hours on a friend's computer because he had already quit playing it to go do something else. And unless this company shapes up and does right by this game (and the series as a whole), I think we're both going to leave it that way.\n\nBottom line? The game definitely has potential. I'm not going to download dozens of patches and make multiple payments to EA to see it realized.";The game's got potential. And not much else.
198;28.0;2.0;47.0;I have been an avid simmer since Sims 1, and even dabbled in creating custom content. Sims 3 was such an improvement over Sims 2, which itself was a huge leap forward from Sims 1. So of course I had to get Sims 4, with great anticipation of the improvements. HAH! I'm now furious that I spent eighty bucks to preorder the Premium Edition Sims 4 and ended up with something akin to Sims 2 for console. It is literally more like an app game.\n\nEverything we loved about Sims 3 is gone! I remember in Sims 1 and 2, the hours wasted on custom content sites, downloading yet another recolor of a dress just so my new sim could have something different to wear. Sims 3 made any recolor possible, for clothing, furnishings, etc. A truly customizable world that sim fans wanted. Well forget that in Sims 4! Nope you will have a handful of color options to choose from for each clothing or furniture style, no color wheel or patterns to customize, and remember the lazy color-blind creators that worked at Sims 1 & 2, who gave us the mint green fridge that didn't quite match the dishwasher? Yep, those design nightmares have returned, so good luck finding things that actually go together! At least we had a dishwasher in Sims2 even if it didn't exactly match the other appliances. No dishwasher in S4, no cars, no laptop... What is the point in giving our sims outfit options (5 possible outfits can be created for each type, ie everyday, formal, etc.) that our sim will randomly choose to wear, when the choices are so limited? Even the hair and makeup that we used to be able to customize to any color, with highlights etc, nope you will have a handful of fake flat hair colors and preset makeups to use. I'm sorry but the removal of the colorwheel and pattern choices, absolutely no valid excuse is acceptable EA! OK so you can pull on the sim's body and shape it, that is cool, but you can't do it to the hair and those choices are ridiculously limited. Frankly I could use the Sims 3 create-a-sim sliders to create as unique of a look that I needed for my game.\n\nThen there is the personality dumbdown in Sims 4. No more favorite colors or foods, and the choices of traits are very lacking. Remember the fun of having an insane, neurotic sim who was afraid of the dark? All you get now is insane. Remember having the ability to make a custom life wish? Pick from a handful now. Ok, maybe I can forgive all that and just enjoy the game play. What the...? Where is the world? It is smaller than the original Sims 1 neighborhood! And you can't even go outside of your sims little area of about 6 lots without TRAVELLING -- remember that dreaded load screen wait in Sims 2 whenever your sim wanted to go visit a friend or the library? It's BAAAAAACK! Seriously? On my system it isn't the 'go make a sandwich and take out the trash' wait of Sims 2 load screens, but why remove the other best thing about Sims 3, the seamless open world?? And forget customizing the world, no world edit is available at all. There are so few empty lots, the new building options are really pointless because there is virtually no place to build anything. If this wasn't enough, I was shocked when my sim went to work, and I couldn't even click on her to view her simology or to see what was in her personal inventory.\n\nIn Sims 4, 99% of the game has just been dumbed down to nothing. In game play, the few positives are that the sims can multitask, and you have more family relationship options. There are more social interactions, they take selfies (a lot!), they feel happy or sad, they walk funny if they have to go to the bathroom, in fact you can give your sim a swagger walk or whatever as part of create-a-sim. Little things here and there that are cool, but to me that isn't enough. These should have been in addition to, not instead of, the advancements made in Sims 3. So, like many no doubt, I'm going back to rich and open world of Sims 3, an infinitely better use of my free time than this pathetic excuse for a 2014 game. Too bad I can't get my money back though. I'm sure this title will be in the bargain bin by the holidays.;A dumbed-down disappointment
416;29.0;1.0;47.0;LACKING & COMPLETE DOWNGRADE.\nFrom the beginning there have been certain things that make the sims, the sims. This game is missing MOST of it. The basic controls are all over the place, there is no longer the the ever familiar status bar for your sim, the camera controls are complicated and the town it self is an utter disappointment. No longer does it have the interactive qualities that I LOVED about sims 3.\nI will say that it does run smooth, but thats because it's missing SOOOO much.\nVery disappointed, I hope they add back some of the Simish qualities.;the camera controls are complicated and the town it self is an utter disappointment. No longer does it have the interactive qual
1;30.0;1.0;45.0;In short SKIP IT!\n\nPrevious posts have called this iteration of the franchise 1 step forward and 3 steps back. I couldn't agree more.  Here is a short list of some to the problems. There are many missing items from this new version. So many in fact that it made me feel like I was playing a demo rather than a fully fleshed out successor to an established game.  We all know about the pools and toddlers, well that's not all. Gone are many items like dishwashers and garbage disposals. Instead we are given about 6 different stove hoods to choose from. Why?  There are also no cars in this version.  Can you say expansion pack? The color wheel which allowed us to customize colors is also missing, replaced by a static dull set of colors to choose from.  Instead of giving us a sad hot dog outfit, clown make up, silly walks, and goofy emotional responses, give us a game that builds on the successes of Sims 3 and make it better.  Finally, the lot and neighborhood size in this version is really limited.  Instead of a large neighborhood you get a few sectors with some small size lots on them. Just pathetic. Did EA not learn anything from their dismal Sim City reboot?  Evidently not.;So many in fact that it made me feel like I was playing a demo rather than a fully ...
352;31.0;3.0;42.0;Add me to the list of people who eagerly awaited the release of this game.  I've played Sims ever since the release of the very first game, also buying Sims 2 and Sims 3 and many of their expansion packs along the way, including 7 expansion packs for Sims 3.  I was actually thinking about waiting for the price to come down before buying Sims 4 since I am still actively playing and enjoying Sims 3, but after watching videos about Sims 4 and playing around with the Sim 4 Create a Sim demo I decided that Sims 4 seemed like enough of an upgrade that I didn't want to wait.  I ignored the fact that they weren't sending out pre-release versions of the game to bloggers for review before launch reportedly over fears of negative reviews that would affect pre-sales.  I assumed that they were afraid of uber-fans who would mercilessly nitpick the game over anything that didn't line up to their expectations.  I should have known better because based on my experiences to date with the game, it warrants criticism.  (And this coming from someone who gave the base Sims 3 game and its expansion packs between 4 and 5 stars.)  Despite all the hype, this game takes some steps forward and some steps back, much like Sims 3.  But unlike Sims 3, I'm not fully convinced yet that the improvements outweigh the omissions.  But because I know different people enjoy different aspects of this game, I'm breaking my review into different components to help you evaluate whether it is for you.\n\nCREATE A SIM AND BUILD MODE\n\nTrue to the marketing, these are the best parts of the game.  I found them to be an improvement over Sims 3 both in terms of what you're able to customize and how user-friendly the interface makes it to do it.  However, there were still some aspects taken away for unknown reasons, so it isn't a total improvement.  That said, if you enjoy customizing your Sims and building houses, I think you'll enjoy these updates on the whole.  For Create A Sim, gone are sliders. Instead, you sculpt your Sim like clay, pulling and pinching places on your Sim to adjust different parts of their appearance. I've made 11 Sims so far and it's clear that you have much more control over even the smallest details. It makes it easier to make a Sim to capture someone's likeness, or a range of completely distinct characters. At first the method of sculpting takes some getting used to, but the more I played around with it, the more I prefer it over the previous versions. A couple tips I figured out where to leave your sim bald and unclothed until you're happy with the Sim's face and body shape. Sure you can adjust with hair and clothes on, but removing them made it much, much easier to see the full impact of the changes I was making while I was still figuring out the new method of making Sims. It also helped to remember I can rotate the Sim and that sometimes, it's easier to sculpt from a side angle vs. the front or vice versa depending on what you are attempting to do.  As with the previous games, you can name your Sims and give them a goal and traits. But there are also new ways to give them personality through more control over their voice and the ability to choose a walk stride for them (i.e. feminine, bouncy, swagger, etc.). It's definitely another fun way to make your Sim characters unique and more real.  That said, there were a couple of things I noticed that seemed like a downgrade after the previous version. The outfits, while fun and fashion forward, seem pretty limited. There also seems to be no way to custom color different items (i.e. hair, skin tone) or to use a range of patterns and colors for outfits.  This also holds true for Build Mode As Well.  I love that in Build Mode it's easier for me to shape my house to make it the way I want and that I have more control over some items, like wall height, but I miss being able to personalize my houses with more colors and textures.\n\nOVERALL INTERFACE\n\nIn going from Sims 2 to Sims 3 I found the overall interface to be more similar than different.  It had increased customization of game play, which meant more menus, but overall everything seemed to be laid out similarly.  This isn't the case with Sims 4.  It looks and feels dramatically different.  From an aesthetics standpoint, the layout and menus look better, but are not very intuitive to an experienced player.  I am sure some of the initial frustration of this will diminish over time as the layout becomes more familiar, but for right now, most of the changes don't intuitively feel like an improvement.  The only change I do like is how the current and planned actions are displayed.  In particular, it's easier to understand when a Sim is multitasking and becomes clearer who they are talking to in group situations.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE\n\nGiven that my computer specs aren't great, I was impressed with how this game looks.  The visuals definitely look more appealing and up to date than Sims 3.  I did have some odd issues with my cursor disappearing a few hours into game play but by changing my screen settings I was able to fix it.  I've also had some weird routing issues where Sims say they can't go somewhere even when there are no obstructions and they sometimes tend to run through each other, sit on top of each other unintentionally.  It's annoying, but not a huge issue.  It has also crashed on occasion, but overall as long as I save regularly the performance does seem to be much better than Sims 3.  The game loads faster overall as I allude to elsewhere in my review and I don't experience as many bugs.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nWith Sims 3, I gameplay was where I felt the game had made the biggest improvements.  With Sims 4 it is the opposite.  Quite honestly, once I'd created my Sims and customized my houses I found the rest of the game to be a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to the addition of emotions because I wanted Sims that would be more nuanced and 'real,' but these haven't seemed to have as big an affect on my game experience as I expected.  At least in my game experience, they were kind of neat at first, but then the appeal wore off.  There are also some new actions and tasks, but again they are the kind of thing that I found fun to discover at first and then lost novelty quickly.  The careers have also changed, and for me it wasn't a good change.  If you like unusual, exciting, quirky careers you'll probably like this new batch better.  Maybe I'm boring, but I like my Sims to have careers that mirror real life so mine were often on the business or medicine track.  Not sure if they are saving this for a University Life expansion pack, but they were sorely missed.  I also don't like that, at least according to my experience playing to date, it seems easier to die.  Sims 4 has 10 ways for your characters to die: Electrocution, Hunger, Fire, Rocket Ship Crash Landing, Old Age, Overexertion, Cowplant, Embarrassment, Anger, and Hysteria.  Again, if you like a kind of quirky gameplay you'll likely enjoy the range of these but it was frustrating to see my Sim die of embarrassment since it seemed unrealistic and makes it hard to create juicier story lines.  (My sim was a bit of a womanizer and got caught by his GF and children cheating with his mistress on the side.\n\nBut probably the biggest disappointment is the way the world is laid out.  The downtown portion of the city is no longer seamlessly integrated into the overall neighborhood, if you want to go there you experience a load screen instead of taking a taxi, driving, etc. to your destination.  Thankfully the load time is very, very quick, even though I am running the minimum specs for this game.  But it feels less real and like a definite downgrade.  Maybe this was to deal with overall game performance issues, and I will admit my game does run much more smoothly than Sims 3, but I'd almost take a little bit of lag to have the old layout back.  It makes it harder to toggle between family members who are at home and family members who are a friend's house or out on the town.  The world in general also feels tiny and not as rich or interesting as those in Sims 3.  The businesses you can visit are much more limited, which makes gameplay boring unless you have homebody Sims.  Though I do like that one of the businesses included is a night club since it is a good choice for dates.  There are also fewer residential lots which means fewer sims to meet.\n\nOBJECTS/BUY MODE\n\nLike Sims 3, the objects included in the base game are pretty limited and some, like dishwashers and bunk beds are sorely missed for me.  It's definitely been clear that they want to push people to buy Expansion Packs and Stuff Packs once those are available.  By the 4th installment of this game I'm pretty used to having to purchase these to expand play, but to me it seems like with Sims 4 it is almost required if you enjoy personalizing your home.  And of course it doesn't help if you are an early adopter and these haven't been released yet.\n\nSo far, I'm very torn on how I feel about the Sims 4.  Given how much the game experience was hyped, as a standalone experience, Sims 4 is pretty disappointing.  It feels like the most fun part of the new game is creating your Sim and their house, not actually playing with them.  I have no doubt that gameplay will be richer once expansion packs are released, but it means that an enjoyable play experience ends up being rather expensive and also requires you to wait until expansion packs are released.  Even though I do think the graphics of Sims 4 look better and much prefer the Sims I've made in Sims 4 vs. Sims 3 I'm feeling bored with Sims 4 already and am feeling the desire to keep playing with Sims 3 until more content is released.  Mostly I'm feeling like shame on me.  EA/Maxis gave little incentive to buy this on day one and still I did it anyway.  I could see where this game would be fun for those who are new to the Sims franchise since you don't have preconceived notions of the game and if you have never played before there is enough to explore and learn in the game.  But for those who have been playing since the first Sims, it's a little lackluster.;Despite being a loyal Sims fan, Sims 4 is just okay
361;32.0;1.0;42.0;I have been a Sims fan for as long as I can remember. I am in my 30's, and have been playing this game since the beginning with the original Sims 1. Sims 1 had a lot of flaws, but it was fun and it made everyone fall in love with the Sims! Then Sims 2 was released, and it was awesome. I fell even harder in love with the game, and spent more hours and money then I would like to admit. Just when I thought they couldn't top this game more, then they released Sims 3, and it was EPIC!\n\nThe base game for Sims 3 was epic. It offered so many new features, but also a large variety of ways you could play the game. You could create stories, work on skills, play between families and have them grow up all in the same story line. I loved the fact that you could walk around the town, travel, explore the ocean through scuba diving, ect ect I could go on for AGES with all of it's epicness. How would they ever top that? Granted, the graphics and bugs were not perfected and polished out, but it was still awesome. When I heard a Sims 4 was being release I was ecstatic! Not only that, but it seemed like they were actually going to listed to the thousands of people buying there game on suggestions and things we wanted. I got many surveys in my email inbox with polls on what I wanted to see. What a fool I was thinking that they were going to ADD ON to the epicness of Sims 3.\n\nRelease day was yesterday. I loaded the game and immediately knew all my hopes and dreams were about to be destroyed. What was I looking at??? The enormous town from Sims 3 had been ruined. I was looking at dismal pitifully small map, with around only 3 lots to build on. No more seemless world. Gone. Destroyed. No more altering plots, building on community lots. I could go on and on. Im not going to waste anyone's time listing the ENORMOUS amounts of things that were provided in the base games for not only Sims 2 and 3, but also Sims 1. The amount of stuff you get (for the very high price of the game) is pathetic, and not only that, it's insulting. I feel like the dumbed the game down for my elementary school kid to play. Does anyone remember SimsTown from back in the day?? Yeah, they stole the ideas for Sims 4 from that. I feel like I went back to playing something like SimFarm all over again.\n\nThe way this has always gone, with the next version of the game coming out, is that it is an improvement on the last. If you go on the Sims website and read the forums you will see that someone took the time to list all the things that were in the previous base games that this version has now taken out. It's a VERY long list. No more pools, less careers (and the ones they left are awful), they took out life stages (toddlers) instead of adding stages or expanding on the ones they already had, no pools, no cars, no cemeteries (you get four community lots total. No, Im not kidding. Four, and they are the most boring community lots ever), no more story line where the neighbors grow up and get married and have kids along with your family, no more family tree (deal breaker for me), no swimming at all (not in lakes, oceans, NADA). I could go on and on and on with the things that got cut. Why would you take dishwashers out of the game?? Either because they were greedy and wanted us to pay for them in an expansion pack, or they just didn't care about what the buyers wanted.\n\nI don't have enough time or energy to type everything about Sims 4 that disappoints me, frustrates me, lets me down, or makes me infuriatingly mad. They took everything that was awesome about Sims 3 and stripped it bare. I have played the game on and off for 48 hours now and I am bored out of my mind with it. The bars go down to fast so that they only thing you have time to do in the game is pee, eat, sleep, and shower. No exaggeration. The time you have left after that isn't much, and there is no where to go in the pitifully small town. Not only that, but you spend the vast majority of your time staring at a loading screen, instead of just walking your sims around the town. Want to go somewhere?? Loading screen. That IS NOT an improvement.\n\nHere are the few things that are better about the game: Graphics (just barely and not worth it), clothes (no color wheel though folks so what's the point?), I like a few minor detail things like the changes they made to pregnancy (although seriously, they could have still made more improvements. (The minimal amounts of improvements they made is pathetic), there are a few improvements on building (I like the blueprints idea )and that's it.\n\nBasically it's like this, if I wanted to scrap everything awesome and take it all back down to the basics I could have just reloaded Sims 1. That's what this game is, and nothing more. Someone needs to be fired over at EA, and they need to go back and take their time doing this right. I feel like over the years they have gotten greedy with us. Offering less and less new stuff with the expansions and charging us an arm and a leg, but this game takes the cake when it comes to EA's greediness.;It's not possible for EA to mess up any worse then this.
357;33.0;1.0;41.0;I've been a Sims fan since the very beginning, but I have to say, I'm sorely disappointed in this game.\n\nThe world is tiny, and to add insult to injury, it's not even open. The game requires socializing with townies, yet this is entirely inconvenient and a complete hassle with loading screens that are back to disrupt smooth game play. Why EA and Maxis would take this tremendous step back is beyond me, but I agree wholeheartedly with the people who say this game should in reality be called The Sims 2.5.\n\nPreviously, my favorite aspect of the Sims series was building, but the new Build Mode is nothing but strenuous, with everything from camera function to UI (which is not at all intuitive, but to make matters worse, is scattered throughout the screen, with some parts on the left, some in the middle, some on the right, and some on the top, making basic actions difficult and time consuming). I don't think I even need to mention how the lack of Create A Style has impacted creative freedom when designing houses. Honestly, that alone makes it so frustrating that even if everything else was fixed, I probably still wouldn't play it. Shifting paint onto a wall now paints the whole wall, even over different paint colors (whereas in Sims 3, it would only cover the type of wall-covering the mouse was on until a new one began). This makes painting multi-colored rooms annoying at best.\n\nWhile I like the aspects of multi-tasking and wider ranges of emotions, this does not make up for what the game lacks. If anything, these aspects should have simply been added to the Sims 3 without completely redesigning the UI and gaming experience in general. This is the first time I've regretted purchasing a Sims base game. Hopefully, Sims 5 is better, but for now, I'll stick with Sims 3.;I'm sorely disappointed in this game
381;34.0;1.0;40.0;"What a waste! I learned my lesson on this one. I will never buy a game without reading reviews. I was so excited for Sims 4 to come out. I bought it thinking it would be just like Sims 3, only better. Boy, was I wrong! This ""game"" is stripped down to the bare minimum. At first, I thought I was not understanding how to make my Sim go to work or go to a restaurant to eat. Then, after reading the forums, I realized that your sim doesn't go anywhere or do anything. It's as if I paid $60 to be able to create a sim and then have nothing for it to do. BIG mistake buying this game. I wish I could return it.";Complete Waste of Money!
419;35.0;1.0;38.0;"Just like what everyone else is saying... they rushed the game. I couldn't even get married. When I planned my wedding event, my character kept showing the ""can't walk there! ""Symbol, and after the event failed, the characters' relationship disappeared.\nThey shouldn't have rushed making the game. It's not worth the price for the minimal content,  especially with the missing toddlers..\nI'm returning the game and just getting the sims 3 instead.\nThe game gets boring, fast! Unlike sims 3.\nThe only plus is the better emotions, but emotions only do so much.\nJust severely disappointed!";Nope.
50;36.0;5.0;32.0;"After reading several negative reviews about the game, I was on the fence about buying this game. It seemed like a lot of simmers hated it compared to the sims3. I've been playing sims since the original sims and was expecting the sims4 to be immaculate. The game does deliver in some areas,  but in others it makes me want to chunk my laptop out the window.  Here's my list of pros/cons:  1) create a sim pro: this is by far the best CAS. I love the graphics and the push/pull effects. Clothes are nice too. Con: you can't really customize colors and patterns. But the clothes are actually modern clothes and have good color choices so this doesn't bother me.  2) building houses pro: you can pickup rooms and move them instead of demolishing them if your not happy with placement. The doors and windows are way better than sims3. You can have average wall height or high celings with one click instead of building two stories to make a high celings. Cons: it is hard as hell to get use to! It's basically the same as sims3, but on crack. I find myself making walls without even clicking on the lot. The camera is way different than sims 3 too. You can either look flat at your house or straight on top of the house. No camera tilting like sims3. Which is a pain when building. 3) the world. I love how they set up the world. There is 3 neighborhoods to choose from and your not limited to that neighborhood like the other sims games. You can live in one area then go to the park in another.  Con: there's not a town view like sims3. Each neighborhood has 4 buildings you can visit (gym, library, ect) and you have to ""travel"" to get there. No cars.  4) live sim mode. Pro: there are so many more interactions and sims do seem to tend to themselves. I'm not constantly clicking the toliet or fridge to help keep them maintained they do take the initiative to do stuff on their own. Con: you can't really influence them at work/school like ""make new friends"" ""suck up to boss"" to help boost their levels of achievement or gain friends. I made a child and after 1 sims week he still had 0 relationships other than his parents. So you actually have to make an effort to be social. 5) items. Pro: there is ALOT of stuff that comes with the sims4 base game. There is a little something for every sim. Some stuff that would only be available through and expansion pack (like the piano in late night) now comes with the base game. You can have anything from a wood workers bench to a rocketship. Cons: I personally haven't missed anything except for there's no cars, and no swings or bikes for children. But that doesn't effect me. However someone else might have been wanting something that wasn't included.  There is several other things I could write about but let's face it, neither of us have all day. My advise would be to each some videos on YouTube so you can kind of see the sims4 in action. Like I said before, there's alot of negative reviews about this game. But I really enjoy playing it.  Also, I ordered this game almost a year after it had been released hoping EA would have worked some of the bugs out. Well, right off the bat it said I had to update the game to the latest patch or I couldn't play it. It took SIX HOURS TO UPDATE! I had several problems with it throwing out an error codr, I had to update it in safe mode just to get the update to work. So anyone who is purchasing it now... you have been warned.  Hope this helps =)";Some simmers will love it, others will hate it
331;37.0;5.0;37.0;"I purchased this title directly from Origin, digital download.\n\nI've been playing Sims since 1, like many of us, and I've liked each one pretty equally for what they've brought to the series rather than what they ""expanded upon"" or changed along the way. I really like TS4 too. Despite the things they left out, it's still a solid entry in the series and the graphics are beautiful.\n\nThere is a learning curve. For the first 3-4 hours I really struggled with the controls. Having played TS3 for years now, I was used to a certain way of moving the camera, as you can imagine, and this new camera felt clunky and unresponsive. To make it worse, inverting the vertical didn't help at all, and neither did the ""Sims 3 camera."" Side scroll worked for side to side but was useless up and down and I had not realized just how dependent I was on that one feature. Then somewhere along the way I accidentally had my left mouse button clicked while pointing at the floor and OMG it moved. The hate melted away and I had a free-roaming camera again, and in a few minutes time I was loving it way more than the TS3 version.\n\nAs for the game, the CAS is easy to work with, and I don't miss the create a style at all. The options available are plenty and I'm positive we'll get new additions after awhile. I don't know about you guys, but after creating about the fiftieth sim in TS3, I didn't bother with create a style, I just used stock clothes, and I had so many anyway that it took forever just to load. I have enough diversity to make each sim unique enough for my purposes, and that's good enough for me. The jobs are all different from before, but I like it. How many level 10 police officers can you make before you avoid that career track? Or criminals. The new ones have more flavor, and the goals for promotion takes the game off easy mode and makes you work for it. There were definitely nights in TS3 when my eyes would glaze with the sheer repetition of doing the same freaking thing on all my sims. The new system might get old too, but for now it's a breath of fresh air. I used to run Twallen's suite of mods just so the town would run smoother and have stories outside of my own house, making it a bit more lively.\n\nThere's stuff missing. I don't care a whit about toddlers. They were irritating and I usually just aged them up unless I was doing a challenge or something. Pools I miss; my sims like to swim. I miss hot tubs too, but they weren't in TS3 base either, and I remember being very irritated about that when TS3 came out too. I lived with it then and will now. No dishwasher, trash compactor, swing set, limited beds and items and such. All that will grow. I don't need a massive assortment of stuff to start with. There's enough. Anyone who's been a fan of this franchise long knows expansion packs and stuff packs are the name of the game, and you had to know coming into TS4 that wouldn't change. We're back to a base game and effectively starting it over. But that's okay.\n\nThe neighborhoods are small and I really dislike the lack of...world modification options. I want to go in and change the ""community"" park in my neighborhood and add stuff like a pirate ship and chess sets and stuff so the kids can have things to do outside the house without leaving the neighborhood for the central park. I might do that with the empty lot anyways. The community town feels more like TS2 and the whole map feels like the console version instead of the PC version, like a backwards and simplified port. But there aren't any rabbitholes, and everything in the ""town"" you can actually enter. The lack of a restaurant is irritating though, I wish the nightclub and bar at least served food besides chips and salsa so we can have a real date and/or ""night on the town"". Still the way the game leaves everyone in care for themselves mode at home while your sim is off having their date or whatever, is great in my opinion. And instead of having a nanny who doesn't eat and pees herself or a babysitter who constantly leaves early, it's just assumed that if you leave the lot, the baby was dropped off with a baby sitter. I haven't tried to hire a maid yet, but my sims usually take care of themselves. Oh and the repair ability and upgrade is a little...mini game of sorts now, you have to collect parts, it's not automatic.\n\nI ultimately left TS2 because TS3 did core mechanics better. I missed a lot of features, sometimes TS3 felt like a blah version, I missed the underlying no regrets humor and the difficulty felt dumbed down. I remember having a wife plead for her husband's life after he killed himself trying to repair the dishwasher and doing like a rock/scissors/paper thing and being so grateful when she won. And last night my sim begged Death for the life of a sim while at a nightclub and his wish was granted. In TS3, unless I deliberately killed my sim, they all died of old age. Except one son who was struck by a random freaking meteor.\n\nI will definitely stay with TS4 and here's why: It's cleaner and way stabler. I didn't freeze ONCE in about 12 hours of straight gameplay. Not once, not even a reboot or crash. My controls (once I figured out the camera) was completely stable and free of lag. My sims walk past each other without getting hung up on things, even through doorways. They don't wait in line to eat like they're at the cafeteria. They can write a novel, listen to the stereo and argue with their son at the same time. They take selfies of each other randomly, start family dance parties, and take snaps of their food while they're eating. If they like the outdoors and are inside too long, they start getting tense and irritated. If they like to be active and aren't for awhile, they do random push up and sit ups. Their emotions are more than just things to pick, they actually influence the sim and how they react to things. There is really so much personality in these little pixel people that I can't give them up and go back. Even for hot tubs (though I hope they bring those back eventually).\n\nIf anyone cares, my system:\nAMD FX 8320 Eight-Core Processor 3.5 GHz\nRaedon HD 6870 Video card\n64 Bit Windows 7\n16GB RAM\n\nDez";My Review for what it's worth
189;38.0;1.0;36.0;"Okay, let me get this out of the way, and say that this is totally Sims 1.5 + Sims Freeplay, not ""2.5"". It doesn't even come close to the awesomeness of TS2. At least in TS2 base game there were several different families that had an interesting storyline, templates for create-a-world, and three (free) neighborhoods.\nAlso, I didn't despise the game. I'm just reluctant to give it 2 stars, because I didn't see anything in this game that justifies the price.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed is the age demographic has been changed from Teen and up to 10 and below. It's so very dumbed down.\n\n...And the cars! Sims don't really walk to where they need to go. They just teleport to the next lot, and BAM! loading screen.\n\nPros that are new additions:\n\n-Fantastic build mode. It's nice to make a house entirely out of blueprints and stretch the walls out. (No auto-roofs though.)\n-Multitasking. Sims can now interact with others without cancelling their queue to do just one thing.\n-Great tattoos.\n-Better graphics. I like the cartoon look.\n-Runs smoothly, and loads up fast.\n-The genetics are fantastic.\n-Townies are back. Finally, I can show up to a venue and more than 2 people will be there.\n-Have your female sim click on the toilet for a pregnancy test instead of the lullaby chime.\n-Breast feeding.\n\nCons that I didn't know were left out. (In addition to the 89 missing features):\n\n-A REALLY tiny, restrictive ""town"". (More like a Facebook map). Only 10 residential per town, and it's basically a few random venues you can actually access.\n-No family tree! Your sims don't have family boundaries.\n-Teenagers are badly shoehorned in. They're basically adults who still go to high school.\n-Nearly all the personality traits are social based.\n-Emotions can get very annoying.\n-No core careers.\n-The motives tank.\n-Lousy UI and camera angles.\n-You can't afford bills. (Criminal track makes $9.00/hr.) That is so depressing.\n-It's just a nice CAS and nothing for them to do.\n-On what planet is this worth $70.00?! It makes me fear for stuff packs that'll have 20% content and 80% DLC.\n\nGameplay kept getting boring over and over. Second, why the emphasis on emotions? Sims always had emotions: They cry when a loved one dies, they laugh at their favorite TV show, they whine about their wants, they have 1,000 moodlets about said actions, etc.\n\nThis is not a vanilla base game. It's a half-baked demo.\n\nEDIT: 12/29/2014. I bought my own PC copy on a black Friday sale for $29.99. (Played it at a friend's house the first time.) The game peaked in three weeks, I forgot about it existing. As a person who has no interest in buying expansion packs, I still don't think what I got is worth the price.";Accept it guys, it's over. (1.5 Stars)
360;39.0;1.0;36.0;"I'd say 1.5 stars more than just one but there you go. It was built to be a social game and then instead of doing a new engine they used that one--and it shows. It really, really, really feels like a console game. Everything I do makes me feel like I am playing a Xbox or PS game that was ported to the PC. As a console game it is fun. But... it isn't a console game. It's the actual next installment in the sims franchise and for that it falls so, so, so flat.\n\nIt feels so much emptier and lacking compared to the base game of sims 2 and sims 3. There are several problems I have found with it. The fact that family legacy simmers have had the rug pulled out from under them makes me SO mad. Babies are just treated like objects and yes, the lack of toddlers will forever annoy me. The teens/young adults/adults/elders have the same body morphs which annoys me as well. There are so few things for the kids... It feels like a mix of sims 1 and sims 2, with a lot of things taken out and only a couple things put in. I don't think it was worth $60. And I really think EA should have put off the release to add more things in, and throw a bone towards the family simmers.\n\nBut, I will say some good things about the game. I personally love the graphics, build mode is super fun, the clutter looks amazing, the animations are so cute.\n\nAs a console game I would have given it 4.5 stars out of 5. But it's not a console game, it's the next installment of the sims franchise so... 1.5/5 for an empty, lackluster, lazy start to this ""generation"" of sims.";Good console game, terrible sims game
365;40.0;1.0;36.0;I've been playing the Sims from the very beginning and have played the whole series. I was really excited for the Sims 4. I bought the game when it came out and played for a couple of hours and all I have to say is that it's a huge disappointment. It sucks because I really want to like this game! I don't get it! There's no open world, jobs aren't that good, they only have maid and pizza services so there's no repairman when objects break which happens A LOT in this game, no toddlers, there's a baby bug, no pools, cars, dishwashers, newspapers, phones for the house, burglar alarms, sims just disappear when they go to work and school so you're stuck at the house waiting for them to come home and customize tool is GONE! It seems like it took a giant step back from the sims 3 and I feel like I'm playing the sims 1 and 2 again but with better graphics. When the sims 3 came out it didn't have that much stuff in the game because it was a base game but it did have new features and it was an improvement from the sims 1 and 2. You could customize anything and it had an open world with no loading! I thought the sims 4 would be a bigger improvement from the sims 3 but it just took a huge step back.;HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT
388;41.0;1.0;36.0;I wish I had read more about it before buying. I have bought every Sims game and was so excited and wanted it the day it came out. The create-a -Sim is the best part but after that it goes downhill. I don't like the graphics style seems even cartoony than the previous versions. The menus, controls, and options are very dumbed down. It's like it's an earlier version of the game not the newest edition. The worst, no family trees and no toddler life stage! I am so disappointed that I spent $60 on this. I don't even want to play it.;I am so disappointed that I spent $60 on this. I don't even want to play it.
22;42.0;1.0;24.0;Stick to sims 3. I do not recommend for hardcore simmers, really only good for newbies.;I do not recommend for hardcore simmers
262;43.0;2.0;35.0;"I've played this series since my mother brought home the first game in the series and said, ""I thought this looked like something you'd like."" I liked The Sims, I liked The Sims 2, I liked The Sims 3. I felt like each of these iterations brought something to the series.\n\nThe Sims 4 is an incomplete game. I saw the lukewarm reviews and still gave it a shot anyway. After all, there are still hard-core Sims 2 fans out there who loathe Sims 3, but I personally liked Sims 3 and have played countless hours of it. I've played Sims 4 for a while, and I keep really wanting to like it, but I just... can't. There are just enough glimmers of ""goodness"" in it to be frustrating and that much more unsatisfying. I've seen reviews describing it as ""hollow"", and I think that's a perfect description. Another reviewer described it as feeling like playing a mobile app, which is also a pretty apt description. The sense I get is that someone decided that they couldn't be bothered to create a fully fleshed-out PC game and then tweak it to port it to game consoles, so they just decided to make a console game and call it a day.\n\nThe Sims 4 has taken a huge step back from what The Sims 3 - or even The Sims 2 - offered. The lack of pools and toddlers is irritating, but maybe tolerable as long as they got patched back in. Unfortunately, the game also lacks basically everything else. Now that I've had toddlers, family trees, CASt and an open world... well, I don't want to give them up. From what I understand, CASt is incompatible with the engine, and it's pretty obvious from playing the game that an open world is also impossible. I spend probably 50% of my Sims 3 play time in CASt, and I mean that in a good way - I love CASt. Having it taken away basically takes away half of the fun of the game for me!\n\nNeighborhoods are tiny. There are limited options for visiting community lots. The entire game world is flat - no Terrain Editor - so I can't sculpt cottages tucked into hillsides. Beyond building houses, you also can't really edit the neighborhood in the way that Sims 3 allowed. There's no open world, and no sense of ""a world"" in the way that Sims 3 provided. In addition, the available career options are weird, and sending Sims to work is boring. There's not even a rabbithole - they just disappear off-screen and I stare at an empty house for 5 minutes.\n\nThe few good things about The Sims 4 are more fluid social interactions, emotional states, and multitasking. Having Sims interact with each other is genuinely fun in a way that it wasn't in some of the previous games in the series. There's less of a sense of ""relationship grinding"", and more of a sense of genuine interaction. Emotional states are more complex than simple Moodlets. They really do have more, well, personality. The graphics are cartoony, but not grating... I kind of like them. The game runs much more smoothly. Building houses is much easier and more fun, and the roof tool in particular has been vastly improved. Building roofs is no longer like pulling teeth.\n\nIf they had used the new system of traits and emotions and the ability to multitask that they'd created, and then taken the Create A Sim tools and Build Mode tools and married them with CASt and an open world, this would be a great game. Unfortunately, they didn't and it's not. It feels like 1/4 of a game. There is no amount of expansion packs or patches that can salvage this game. EA has strangled its Golden Goose.\n\nI've been trying to play The Sims 4 a little bit more, hoping that maybe I'll change my mind, but I just can't enjoy it. I guess I'll keep playing The Sims 3 and waiting for The Sims 5, when they'll hopefully make the game that The Sims 4 should have been.";About 1/4 Of A Game
386;44.0;1.0;35.0;"I would give 0 stars to this ""thing"" if I could. I've been playing Sims forever and,  thanks to many modders, I enjoy playing Sims 3. Sims 4 is a step back in every sense and I don't intend to touch it until there is a lot of content created by the modders community. I'm guessing that EA made this ""thing"" so basic with the intention of having people pay for expansions,  store content etc. Well I am fed up and will not take the bait.\nThe ""best"" part was the patch on release date. I feel that EA launched a product that needed at least another year of development.\nPity that I didn't read ""89 Features Missing from The Sims 4"" on ts4news before today. Would have saved more than 60 wasted dollars .";Disappointing.
392;45.0;1.0;35.0;Okay, if in the tutorial lessons there is a section apologizing for glitches and grammar problems in the program, you know something is wrong. They took the time to make an apology in the game, but didn't bother fixing the problems? Way too expensive for a lackluster product. It plays like a free online game. The graphics on the sims when designing the characters is much improved since Sims 3, but gameplay is deconstructed to the level of Sims 1. Without a name with a following, I doubt this game would have received any attention and would have been doomed to the clearance bin.\nIt crashes on my desktop, but am able to run it on my laptop. Controls are rough, and it is not well thought out on the placement of the menu, and just very sloppy gameplay. It doesn't pause or lag, but the quality is not there. Babies are born looking like demons (like what happened with custom content in the other games, make them look like spiders with eyes sticking out), and almost from the start, you can choose to have them become children. Much of what you looked for in its predecessors is missing.\nHonestly, it plays like programmers were told what to do by people who neither played the game, or cared much about why people played the game. I am trying to return the product now, so can only warn people that this is a waste of money.\nYou are limited almost entirely to interaction on the lot, very little in the town, and neighbors have no story progression, something that made SIms 3 unique. I don't know if it is so bare bones to take advantage of expansion packs, but there is no game content, really, as it is now. I cannot recommend this product to anyone, fan or not of the franchise.;If this game didn't already have a following from its predecessors, no one would uye it
4;46.0;2.0;34.0;Let me start that I admire EA for making the characters deeper. For a life simulator, deeper characters are definitely a plus. EA has emphasized this, and it's definitely delivers as a proof-of-concept. This, along with the graphical overhaul deserves two stars.\n\nHowever, this game feels like it regressed in many other ways. I won't go into the lack of toddlers and pools, that's been beaten to death. What people aren't talking about as much are:\n\n1. Create-a-sim has been nerfed. You only have around 5 patterns or colors per furniture/piece of clothing\n- No more thousands of combinations of patterns to customize clothing\n- You don't have a color wheel as well to edit\n\n2. You are back to dollhouse mode like in Sims 1 and 2.\n- No more open world like in Sims 3. You have to go to a loading screen even just to visit the people next door.\n- Loading screens are signs of a bygone era. This is unacceptable considering Sims 3 got us past this already.\n\n3. Character interactions are much less and just weird.\n- You don't have as much character interactions.\n- There are weird interactions like when you are having your sim talk to someone, another person your sim doesn't know just joins the conversation, and you can't kick that extra person out of the combined conversation without quitting it.\n\nI really wanted to like the Sims 4. However it feels like it took us too many steps back to give us the new emotion system. This is not a game, but a proof-of-concept of the emotion system. Compared to the Sims 3 base game, which really made you feel like you cannot go back to the Sims 2, this incomplete version of a game only makes me want to go back to the Sims 3.;One step forward, three steps back
427;47.0;1.0;34.0;I am a huge lover of the Sims franchise.  So much so, that even though it pains me to do this, I had to say something.  I played this game for an hour.  I knew from the moment after I had created my sim (a process I quite enjoyed) and went to choose a home for this sim that the game was bad.\n\nThe game is so limiting.  There is all of this mention about the sims having more personality. They may have, but they have nothing else.  The town is lacking in depth.  I liken it to the original Sims game, with the ten lots.  It's about the same as that.  It felt bare-bones, and as someone who has purchased every game and every expansion pack, I expected more.\n\nI also want to add that the interface was completely revamped and did not feel  intuitive after the 14 or so years I played the first three games.;So Disappointing
253;48.0;1.0;33.0;"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\nThis game went a step behind, instead of a step forward.\nLet it be said that I have been here since the very first Sims game was made. I've seen EA develop and learn many things over the years. This game is only more proof of what we feared, taking from the base game to add to expansion packs.\n\nPros:\n1. Beautiful game. A mixture of Sims 2 and Sims 3 graphics. It was obviously trying to make everyone happy with the formula of realisim and cartoonism.\n2. Create-A-Sim has mindblowing mechanics. Being able to push and pull at any part of my Sim's body was heavily amusing.\n3. The Sims AI's have been tweaked. They can multi-task, hold multiple conversations at once, and show emotion.\n4. The new build system. It's quick, easy, and barely time consuming. Beautiful homes can be created with little stress.\n5. Gameplay is smooth and runs much better than the Sims 3.\n\nCons:\n1. Again, weather fails to make an appearance in the base game. No rain, no snow, no hail, no anything of the sort.\n2. Toddlers were ripped from the game completely. Newborn babies suddenly turn into a child.\n3. Swimming pools were torn from us as well. No more drowning our hated Sims.\n4. Open world was completely removed. To get to a destination, you must use the travel option on your phone.\n5. No vehicles of any sort.\n6. Hospitals, work buildings, and schools are completely gone. The game is a giant rabbit hole, very much like the Sims 2.\n7. Loading this, loading that. Constant loading wherever you want to go. (I just keep my Sims in the house!)\n8. Base game is very small. There is a lack of activities, a lack of consequences for actions, and overall story development seems to be completely missing. The amount of clothing in the game is pathetic.\n9. Our customization has been dumbed down once again. There is no longer a create-a-style option. You're forced with EA's handpicked colors for furniture and walls. Even a color wheel would have been acceptable.\n10. The skills take ages to develop. You find yourself almost constantly having to worry about your Sim's needs. Especially in public. There is no time to reach their job requirements and their aspirations. Majority of the time spent playing will be spent messing with their moodlets. (Unless you get fed up and cheat, as I did.)\n11. Forced online game installation. You must have a high speed internet connection for the Origin program, or it will claim you're offline and refuse to install the game.\n12. You're forced to play in only two ""worlds"". Both of which are ridiculously tiny, very little room to create tons of families.\n13. Camera controls are glitchy and slow. Edge scrolling has never been more painful.\n14. There is nothing new or unique about this game. Multi-tasking is the only evolutionary thing this game has to offer.\n15. Sims die very easily. You can laugh to death, cry to death, or even get embarrassed to death.\n16. A total of 12 hours worth of playtime. By then you have seen everything or done everything there is to do.\n17. Items we have always had in previous games are completely missing without any explanation. EA blames their ""new game engine"".\n18. Rabbit holes everywhere. It's literally the Sims 2 with a little more freedom.\n19. The game will soon have to bare with however many glitchy expansion packs EA will decide to release in the near future.\n\nWithin the first twelve hours of gameplay, I have already come upon a few bugs:\n1. (Fixed in an update) The loading screen music is constantly playing in the background in all of my saves. Had to mute the game's music.\n2. I adopted a girl and it suddenly became my Sim's sister. (and my husband's daughter. Figure that one out.)\n3. (Fixed in an update) THE SIMS REFUSE TO CLEAN UP THE DIRTY DISHES. They will pick up a plate and hold it for a few seconds before putting it right back down.\n4. The sliders in CAS will sometimes bug, and completely alter something. (One time I was editing my Sim's eyebrows and their eyes got really wide. It acted like I was using both of the sliders. The undo button did not correct the issue.)\n5. My Sim can romance his own parents.\nThe patches are not fast enough to compensate for the amount of issues. Simple things slipped right past EA's testing.\n\nIn conclusion, stay with The Sims 3,  2 and 1 for now. We'll see what direction EA decides to go in after these reviews.";EA STRIKES AGAIN!
353;49.0;1.0;33.0;"This is my first Amazon review and I decided to review this because I was so utterly disappointed with this product. First of all, if you are a big fan of The Sims series like I am, avoid this game until a price drop. This game is NOT worth it's outrageous price of $60. The game lacks content compared to the former Sims 3 which was a FANTASTIC base game. Many things that were loved about the original Sims games have been completely taken out of The Sims 4 to ""showcase emotions and multi-tasking"". There are no pools in this game, there is no longer a toddler stage, classic Sims jobs are gone, there are no more ""favorites"" like there were in the Sims 3, and I feel very limited but character customization as the color wheel for clothes and hair was been completely removed. Even little things like the removal of the dishwasher item has me upset. This game is such a disappointment and I feel legitimately ripped off for the amount of money I spent. I really hope EA does something about this because this is a disgrace to The Sims series and a disservice to their fan base.";I'm bored already....
387;50.0;5.0;33.0;"I actually bought this direct from Origin but I thought I would review since it seems so negative thus far. As another reviewer pointed out- it really depends on what appeals to you in gameplay paralleling it to sims 2 and sims 3. For me, this is way better than sims 3. Don't get me wrong- I loved the last game. But I tended to build rather than play because there was so much going on that playing a household almost felt like a chore.\n\nMy thoughts...\n\nDynamics of emotions means more realistic relationships/families/careers. They are fun to watch.\n\nShorter time going from point A to B. I don't have to wait for ""hours"" for my sim to drive across town. Just a quick load screen and you are there.\n\nThings like books can be purchased at the shelf in home- love that!\n\nI hated toddlers. Time consuming. I don't miss them.\n\nOr the mailman, or the repoman...\n\nSeriously, how often did your sims swim?! And if you did give them a pool, that's all they would do. Do not miss.\n\nThe aspirations and whims are more simple to use. You can change any time. Excellent!\n\nThe children have more in depth desires too. In fact, everything from careers to school requires a little work. Previously, I could get to level ten in a career in no time, or children to the top of their class. This is much more realistic now.\n\nMultitasking!!! Things get done so much faster and more realistically. At what point do you stop and read a book and nothing else. Or play on the computer and ignore everyone else around you. It feels so much more like real life.\n\nBuild mode is beautiful. That is my favorite thing to do- its faster and easier to make changes. Love this.\n\nSkills. Lots of skills! There are variations of everything.\n\nThe job options are odd..... (no classic careers) but I'm sure more will be added later. But it is neat that you can branch off into different paths within that same career.\n\nLove CAS and the options they added in the base.\n\nI never really used the color wheel..... way time consuming. Who has time to pick patterns and textures for EVERYTHING. Not I. I think the options they've given are plenty adequate and will improve with custom content and expansions.\n\nAlso really love the gallery.... I never uploaded anything previously because it was time consuming and awkward but I've already shared a house and scanned through others' creations. Way cool.\n\nThe details.... my sim's boobs get bigger during pregnancy and after three kids she was a little chubby and needed to hit the gym. What human woman bounces back to the abs she had previously?!\n\nI don't have a problem with the camera like others have. I use hot keys, the arrow buttons and the < and > buttons to rotate. It is awkward to rotate the camera if you are holding an item... as those rotate hot keys default to moving the direction of your object. You have to manually rotate the camera at that point. That could be improved, but not a big deal.\n\nThere is no option to manually designate life spans. I did enjoy that feature. I'd limit babies and toddlers but make adults last DAYYS. Now it's just short... medium and long life spans.\n\nThey added a lot of objects to create realism from the start. Like, toothbrush holders, spice racks, ect. I love making detailed, lived in looking homes and they gave me plenty to do that with.\n\nThe kids are actually CUTE! And have cute clothes. Sims 3 kids were hideous and had no clothing options.\n\nYou can leave the house with a baby there still. While it doesn't make sense......... I don't mind it. It was so annoying to have to get a sitter or whatever to run to the bookstore.\n\nIf you cheat to make all needs happy, the cheat disappears if you leave the lot. That is kind of annoying. I'd like needs to remain static through travel if I want. Not everyone cheats but sometimes I do like to just make them happy, ok!?\n\nEssentially, for me they took out all the annoying things that slowed me down and created a more realistic life. Much more fun to actually play with my sims now... Not such a chore. It's much like sims 2. So I guess it's all dependent on how you play. One thing I miss is story progression, however.\n\nI think they did a beautiful job on the base and look forward to expansions!";Depends on your gameplay..
420;51.0;1.0;33.0;This game is the biggest disapointment in all sims history. My sims aren't emotionally complex and build mode has been dumbed down so a preschooler can make a four walled house. My sim has been getting stuck and the graphics are horrible. I play on a 55 inch screen and I have to zoom out half way of the lot to not have a blurry view of everything. The graphics won't go any higher. They have very little options for items but rather have different bland color schemes. This game looks like it is a prequel to sims 2. To round this review up. The graphics are horrible, the price is too high, the sims are as stupid as slugs, build mode is the most difficult thing to navigate, the interface for playing forces you to click all over the screen to tiny confusing buttons with some hot keys that don't work. Don't buy this game please. I have never been so disapointed with a new video game in my life. Sad sad day for me and sims;New gameplay? More like new game with minimal objectives
430;52.0;1.0;33.0;Horrible controls.\n\nBut most importantly no toddlers?! Really! The family aspect is my favorite part so to have the game go back the sims 1 status is greatly disappointed. There better be an update that fixes this or I'm going back to the sims 3.\n\nAnd another big issue. The worlds are way too small. Barely any free lots.\n\nIn summary as an avid sim player since the sims 1 whose been waiting impatiently for this game for months I am left greatly disappointed.;Terrible
382;53.0;1.0;32.0;I'm really surprised by the sparseness of this game. I'm a bit confused as to why things like terraforming, toddlers and basic items like dishwashers appear to have been cut. I can only assume that they expect to fill this game out with DLC. For the price they're asking, it's really not worth investing in a halfbaked game.;I'm a bit confused as to why things like terraforming, toddlers and basic items like dishwashers appear ...
407;54.0;1.0;32.0;Seriously, let's pretend that this game didn't come out. Everyone should just go back to The Sims 3.\n\nThis game is horribly lacking in many things. While things overall look better graphically, the lack of content and gameplay is a pretty huge problem. Get your money back while you still can. Maybe in a year or two when a few DLCs have come out this game may get better. The sad part is that the lack of content in the initial release seems like a purposeful omission by EA just so that they can make more money charging for content that should of been in the initial release in the first place.;Disappointing. Save your money.
2;55.0;1.0;30.0;Just bought this game on Origin. Absolutely garbage. It feels like a lame lagging mop-up of the Sims 3 with less features, same graphics, the building sucks, and so does the create-a-sim. You can't even move freely around the entire town! You're restricted to this tiny area. Defiantly not worth it!;AWFUL
113;56.0;1.0;28.0;I have been playing Sims since the Sims2. I loved the Sims 3 and played for hours each day. I was thrilled when I bought the Sims 4 only to find out it was a huge disappointment. Don't buy this. It's not much better than the Sims free play. Limited space for building, poor graphics, expensive, and you can't roam the neighborhood freely. Stick with the Sims 3. Much better gaming. Huge backslide!;I loved the Sims 3 and played for hours each day
364;57.0;1.0;29.0;"When I saw the ""world"" I had to play in I knew this game stunk. A couple of lots...and loading screens between them all. This looks and plays like a $1.99 ""app"", not a $65 game. My sim felt like a prisoner in a tiny cartoon prison. I uninstalled the game to put him out of his misery.";Avoid buyer remorse...Don't buy!!
421;58.0;1.0;29.0;So let me get this straight... they combined the Building and Shopping but moving doors is difficult. They removed toddler mode... the neighborhood went back to Sims 2 style... Definitely a no buy i am returning this for a refund.;The Sims went back in time.
330;59.0;2.0;28.0;"I have played the Sims games for most of my life (all gens (even FreePlay when I'm desperate), 3 being my favorite, 1 being nostalgic), and got this right away as a loyal player, despite the *very* sketchy lack of pre-release gaming reviews and less than thrilling trailers. I have found myself having a very, very hard time getting into this game. I had no idea before the Sims 4, but I *love* the Sims 3 for the creativity it allows you. So in comparison, the Sims 4 feels like a complete downgrade. (If you really like the socializing aspect of the Sims, this might be the game for you.)\n\nHowever, for a game in and of itself, without comparison to older gens, it's...okay, maybe a 3 star. But considering that I cannot remove past games from weighing in on my judgment, I drop it to 2 stars, because it's not absolutely horrible. Money waste, yes, but horrible game, no.\n\nI like:\n1. It runs smooth as can be. I have a good laptop, so that surely helps, but it runs much better than 3. (To be expected with lack of open world, though.) So for those with crappy computers, it'll still run pretty well with low settings, I would guess.\n2. The create-a-sim is much easier to use, as far as customizing faces and bodies.\n3. I like the ease of adding in foundations to a house and the levels of day/night controls.\n4. The new moods and emotional aspects of the game is an enhancement, albeit a smaller one than I think EA was banking on.\n\nI don't like (well the biggest things):\n1. The lack of customization for building and buying. It's ridiculous. It's nice that with the pre-made colors/designs you can match everything easily, and it doesn't take as long to ""customize"" items, but I still can't believe how limiting/dumbed down they made the whole building/buying process.\n2. Though the graphics aren't bad and they're pretty, they are way too cartoonish for my taste. Up until now the goal of the Sims has been to make the games MORE realistic, which these graphics certainly are not.\n3. The controls are super annoying. Everything seems to be either too slow or too fast. Edge-scrolling is horrible, and you can't even scroll down when in build mode because of the menu. The fact that you can't click-hold-drag to rotate objects when buying them is also super annoying.\n4. Serious lack of customization in settings. Case and point: Free will is either on or off; there's no low free will anymore! (Which means if you want decent control over them, turn it off... which causes them to become pretty dumb.)\n5. All of the features they got rid of that take it down about 2 gens: pools, toddlers, terrain levels, basements, 3+ stories, open worlds, lots that are large, towns with a decent number of lots, dishwashers, trash compactors, cars, bikes, and even the ability for more than one person to have a save file! Plus more I haven't discovered or forgot, I'm sure.\n6. It's very expensive for what you get. And though most of those removed features will probably come back eventually, you'll likely have to pay for them via expansions, which is ridiculous considering the amount already paid expecting those should-be-staple things. (Mac sales will probably be an epic low because of the negative reviews; they should've released both platforms at once to guarantee higher profits.)\n\nAll in all, it *feels* like I'm playing an advanced version of FreePlay, at least compared to Sims 3. And it surely is an improvement compared to FreePlay, Sims 1, and arguably Sims 2 (the base games at least), but I really love Sims 3 and it feels like they got rid of everything I loved about it.\n\nUPDATE 3/12/2015:\n\nI switched back to the Sims 3 a couple weeks ago after giving 4 a solid run, and it makes the Sims 4 look horrible. For me it boils down to, ""How much freedom do I have to edit/control this game?"" because I love being creative in video games. Switching back to TS3 didn't feel at all like going back a gen. There are a few of those TS4 pros that would be cool to have in TS3, but overall TS3 felt like an upgrade switching back. I cannot see TS4 getting to where TS3 is, regardless of expansions. But hey, maybe EA will surprise me.";Advanced version of FreePlay?
404;60.0;2.0;27.0;I am a huge Sims fan, always have been. I was very excited to see Sims 4 coming - they amped it up to be this amazing new game. I could not agree more with the other reviews on here... The Sims personalities, the way they look and interact is fantastic. But thats the whole game right now. Honestly. I purchased the game this morning came home excited to play spent a good 5 hours hoping something was going to happen once my sim progressed so far. Nothing. What I did during my 5 hours was socialize. socialize, go to work, socialize, improve skills, go to work. build a little. There are tons and tons and tons of content left out. At this point in time I would rather revert back to playing Sims 3. This game has huge potential. Hopefully EA makes good with their fans and adds free downloadable updates and content to make this worth owning. When I first starting playing Sims 3 I was glued to my chair. After my 5 hours today with Sims 4 I was bored and shut it off. Such a shame.;Disappointed in a very loved series.
267;61.0;4.0;26.0;"The problem with people comparing this to the Sims3 this and the Sims3 that is that they have very short memories. One reviewer talks about fishing in the woods and jogging down to the library. Oh how wonderful and fun! Yes, except it was not this way when the Sims 3 launched. There was no library, or fishing in the woods, or working at the parlor. All of these things were rabbit holes that your Sim disappeared into and you received a text message about what they were doing. Real fun.\n\nThe so called Story progression was so broken that it took independent modders to even make it useable. It was nothing more than a random deleting and creating of Sims. When you looked into the household the ""families"" didn't even make sense, random adults and children thrown together. The infants were burrito maggot babies and the toddlers did nothing. Toys that had functioned in the Sims2 were mere decorations in the Sims3. Now a 100 ok, 67 patches and 30 expansion packs later.... ""It is an awesome game!"" It ought to be.\n\nNow onto the Sims4. The game is put together at launch much better than the Sims3 was. At least everything works. It doesn't lag or drag and the emotions as much as the technology will allow do work. The open world is gone to improve performance. Those that are complaining about it being to empty are overlooking that you can add onto it. You can build more community lots and houses. You can evict the Sims that are there and move in your own. You can bull doze the houses and create your own. The community lots may not be an ""open world"", but when you visit them they are full of other Sims engaged in fun and logical activities. For example when you visit the gym there are other Sims there working out and visiting. If you go to the club, the music is playing and Sims are socializing as you would expects.\n\nThe Sims themselves have a lot more life to them. They actually act like thinking beings. For example when my Sim child came home his mother went into his room to greet him and hug him and they began to talk about his day. As a family player that I am, it was a scene out of my dreams! With the other Sim games I would have to direct the mothers every move. Often I would direct a Sim parent into a child's room to visit with them and the Sim would go where I told them to and then stand staring at the wall. With the Sims4 Sims notice other Sims and will immediately began to engage.\n\nThe graphic are vibrant and colorful and the Sims themselves look bright and varied. Unlike the Sims3 and their ""pudding"" look. The amazing Sims3 that you see posted now, are the result of custom content. And that is my point, the Sims3 when it launched was truly broken, and it took awhile to bring it up, but now despite the fact that Sims4 is not broken, people are unwilling to give it a chance and are unfairly comparing it to a fully loaded, expanded, modded, and patched Sims3.\n\nAre there some misses with Sims4? Yes. There is content such as dishwashers, pools, and decent careers that are sorely missing. The worst offence is the missing toddlers and teens. Yes teens are missing. EA tried to cheat by passing off grown adults as teens, but they clearly are not, sort of like those old movies, Grease comes to mind, where they have 30 year olds playing teenagers in high school...right. I don't count the open world as miss because it was taken out for performance reasons, the same is true of the styling system CASt, that has the Barbie doll players upset. They should have put a color wheel in however, I agree with that.\n\nAll in all I give this game a four out of five because the effort in programming is clearly there. And they succeeded in making more aware and lifelike reactions in the Sims themselves. No easy feat. Unfortunately they seem to have put their focus on one life stage, that of young adults between the ages of 18 and 28 years, living in an utopia with giant microscopes and everyone is an artist. These are things however that can be worked on. The  base is solid and that counts for a great deal. No one likes to play a game that, no matter how awesome, crashes every 15 minutes.\n\nI think the game is worth the usual asking price for new games. If you can find it on sale and that will make you happy great. The problem for EA and the Sims is that it is a game with a wide and varied fan base and it can be hard to please everyone. Unlike a game like Madden where all you have to do is update the roster and graphics add in more control and just make the best football game that you can for a select fan base, the Sims presents far more challenges. Hope this review adds some perspective to all the negative.";A Different Perspective - You can't please everyone.
186;62.0;1.0;25.0;I ordered the digital deluxe with bonus content from Origin.  With tax, it came to almost $75.  If it had been a $20 or even $30 game, I'd be disappointed with the lack of content - but for $75?  I'm po'd.  No toddlers?  No pools?  No basements?  No cars?  No open world?  All these loading screens?  One of the things I miss the most is the tool that allowed us to customize colors and textures for almost everything in Sims 3.  The choices for EVERYTHING in this game are SO limited.  And of course, EA wants it that way so that they can nickel and dime us down the line for things that should have been in the base game.  Of course I understand that the core game will not be as fully fleshed out as a game with a bunch of expansions, but come on, EA!  I was bored to death within an hour of playing and requested a refund.  Twice the price for half the content of previous base games?  And it is buggy!.;I'd be disappointed with the lack of content - but for $75

And unfortunately we assume that content will come later as DLC(since there is already DLC).\n$60 dollars for a gutted game is outrageous.\nI compare this to buying WoW for $60 bucks but you need to pay another $15 to wear a helmet, oh you want to dual wield thats $15 bucks too, oh do you want to leave Orgrimmar?  Thats $15.  Hell if you want to see other players thats another $15 lets just get your credit card added.\n\nAvoid this game until they learn from their ways and package more content in their games.  Not just a barely changed revamp of the last model that is missing half the content.;... the sims 3 building our own family and having fun with the jobs
380;65.0;1.0;24.0;After anxiously awaiting this game for months on end, I was already extremely disappointed with reading the reviews and the idea that there was a lot of missing content. I pre-ordered this game and opened it last night as soon as it arrived in the mail. I have to say that the ONLY thing I really enjoyed about this is the Create-a-Sim Mode and the fact that this game runs much faster than all previous Sims.  I have to agree with other reviewers in that EA really really downgraded from The Sims 3, and its really sad because in today's world of technology this shouldnt even be an issue-ESPECIALLY for the price they are asking. The worst part of the game is the camera controls..I don't like the fact that everytime I want to rotate I have to right click and turn..why couldn't they have kept some of the controls basic like with all the previous games?  Another reviewer stated that this feels like a bad breakup and it really does. I have been a hard core Sims fan from the day Sims 1 came out and now I feel like it's never going to be the same...for as long as they spent creating a new version of the Sims, I would have expected MUCH more out of it. It's sad that so many people are disappointed. Hopefully they will at least create an expansion pack that has ALOT more additional content.\nI only played for a few hours last night, but I got frustrated with the controls and ended up giving up. I suppose I will go back and try giving it another chance.;Long time Sims fan, seriously disappointed in this game...
383;66.0;2.0;24.0;I was so excited for this game that I pre-ordered it and kept counting down the days till its release, and when it finally arrived, the first thing I did was put in the disc while trying to contain my urge to squeal from happiness. The create-a-sim was fun and I enjoyed it, but once the actual game started, my face kinda fell, and instead of the giddiness I had been feeling, disappointment washed over me. Yes, I knew about the lack of toddlers and pools and heard people mention that there were limited lots (and they're not kidding, these neighborhoods are ridiculously tiny and limited), but that wasn't what killed it for me.\n\nThe controls are terrible and it took a couple minutes to figure out how to rotate (and I'm not a slow learner) and it just got worse from there. I was so annoyed that I turned it off after LESS than an hour of playing. After intending on playing all afternoon and staying up entirely too late exploring this new game, I had to just shut it off.\n\nNow that I've had nearly a day to get over the initial disappointment, I've decided to give this game a chance. It did cost 60 dollars, after all. Maybe after playing with my expectations lowered (and getting acquainted with the controls), it won't be so bad. We'll see.;A disappointing downgrade
175;67.0;1.0;23.0;I have played and enjoyed each game in the franchise up until this point, despite the money-grubbing tactics of spreading the content out among so many expansion packs and the rather unforgivable regurgitation of the same features in each different set of games (e.g. Pets for Sims 2 and Pets for Sims 3). I have seen estimates for the cost of the Sims 3 game plus all added content that are above $450, and that doesn't include the cost of The Sims 2 plus all of its expansions and stuff packs (something like 11) and the first game plus all of its add-ons.\n\nEA is really really brave with this game, stripping it down to near tablet level and trying to sucker people into the same ferret's wheel again, only with a worse framework to base the rat race upon. That's right, folks... we're back to Sims 2 style walled gardens, the game was designed for hardware that's a decade old (the Athlon 64 64-bit processor came out 11 years ago), EA didn't even bother with a 64-bit binary to correct the long-standing problem of 3rd-party content hitting the 32-bit RAM limits -- something that has been evident since the Sims 2 engine, and the company had the nerve to threaten gamers with the annihilation of the franchise if not enough of them throw money at this farce. Seriously... search EA threatens sims if you want to see this new low in gaming for yourself. (You can also search EA threatens without adding in sims to see some interesting stuff about its handling of SimCity).\n\nI could go on, but suffice to say that this is to The Sims what SimCity 5 is to the SimCity franchise... almost. In fact, it's actually quite a bit worse. SimCity 4 and its Rush Hour pack never cost over $450, did it?\n\nIs this really the worst game of all-time? Yes... yes it is. This is the first time a game has truly been this craven, this crass... even to the point of being pushed with threats. And, no... this game isn't so similar to The Sims 2 (something that so many reviews are claiming). The Sims 2 was much better, particularly considering how long ago it came out. Plus, with 3rd-party content Sims in that game look a heck of a lot better than they do in this tablet game.;The worst video game of all-time? Yes.
216;68.0;1.0;23.0;Let me start out by saying: I am profoundly dumbfounded and bewildered about how evil this company has become since my childhood. Seriously, words need a poet to describe how utterly evil and destructive to the gaming industry EA has become over the last 12 or so years. This is a company that is buying out all the rights (using money they made from making groundbreaking, legendary games in the past that Maxis influenced) to publish any game having to do with Professional sports, college sports and simulation games just to name a few. I wouldn't care less if that was the end of the story, however, Now they are now almost done buying out the entire industry, EA is churning out the most lazily programmed, bland, boring and predictable games using ideas almost 2 decades old.\nI grew up with playing the Sims. I started with 1 in middle school and moved up to what I think is the pentacle of the series Sims 2 in high school. I bought every expansion pack for it using money I had saved for months. Almost my whole summer of 2006 was devoted to staring at the computer screen for hours upon hours. The days seemed to meld into each other. Then my first year of college, Sims 3 made its debut. I was heartbroken. It seemed like all the heart and soul had been vaccumed out of the series. The best items where put behind a pay wall by EA. Additionally, even the most bleeding edge processors at the time could not handle the strain Sims 3 put on them. So I lost almost all interest in the Sims until very recently (2014) when affordable technology was just catching up to the programming of Sims 3.\n\nNow we are living in the future playing the 4th installment of this game and I couldn't be more disappointed. They ripped out all the innovative and fun things that made Sims 2 and 3 unique and left in all of the bad parts. I guess the programmers decided if they couldn't program a working, real-time, breathing town the first time, they might as well give up. I guess they were afraid that if they couldn't get the new Simcity (a dedicated city builder) to work right, then making it work for Sims that had 24 hour schedules was just too hard. As another reviewer on amazon said about it, EA knows you are going to spend the money on it anyway. Which I think hits the nail on the head. Also of course just as last time, buying the old expansion packs doesn't mean anything and are not in any way compatible with Sims 4. The graphics seem similar enough from Sims 3 that you should be at least be able to import items, if not Sims and properties from 3. So I guess if you want to have the whole Sims 4 experience you are going to have to shell out another $500 dollars and wait another 4 years for the expansion packs. Not to mention the money you are going to be spending on all the good items EA puts behind an ONLINE PAY WALL. All that on top of dropping $70 on one of the most expensive production games in history. Let me tell you this game is not worth $70. Its not even worth buying for $40 in my opinion.\n\nSure there are a couple of new things to this edition. Sims can muti-task (if told to). The create-a-sim tools are slightly more user friendly and powerful, and Sims seem to an extent more social and interesting. (Rather than constantly sitting on their ass watching TV or computer games literally all day long before they starve half to death and wet their pants.) Beyond that, I don't see why anyone would like this edition over 2 or 3. (or even 1).\n\nIn closing, if I had any stock at all in EA I would be selling it. If I had any money I would be buying it short. This is a company that is destroying its own game franchises almost on a level of sabotage, over charging for new games we've played years ago, and insisting that you put more money into a game that you have already purchased to make it remotely playable for good measure. If this is now the level at which these guys produce games now, I don't see Sims 5 or Simcity 5 being nearly successful as its predecessors in this lifetime. Get bent EA.;Another EA franchise bites the dust.
255;69.0;1.0;23.0;"I like the new Create-a-Sim. It's not as cool as they said it'd be (ie you can't make hair styles longer or shorter, can't add highlights, and the sliders are more confusing than anything and there isn't that many of them) but it does a good job allowing you to make sims that look very unique (unlike sims 3 where they all looked alike). The makeup options are better, too. I like that they included tattoos, though you can't decide where to put them! For shame! But it's much faster to make a Sim now. The loss of Create-a-Style is very disappointing, however. That was a huge step in the Sims 3, surely it couldn't be that hard to add a color wheel? :( At least the clothes and hair are much more fashionable now.\n\nSo making my sims was fun, but then I got into the actual game. I didn't really care about the small worlds; I already knew this game wasn't going to be open-world like the Sims 3, so I just bought a house. That's when I started to hate the game, when I got into the actual gameplay.\n\nThe UI is confusing and I haven't found where the needs are yet, so I have no idea about those. Also, the sound effect whenever a sim changes emotion is starting to get annoying already. The graphics aren't very good at all. Everything looks dull in the house; the textures aren't as good as Sims 3 and I'm playing on ultra. It just doesn't look good. It's even noticeable outside where it looks a little better--grass and terrain definitely aren't as good as Sims 3's. Sims make weird expressions like they do in Sims 2 where it looks like their eyebrows rise up into their hair. Food is so bland looking too.\n\nCamera is SO SLOW and edge-scrolling doesn't work correctly (have to use arrow keys) a bad camera is the quickest way to annoy gamers.\n\nSince it's not open-world, there's a blur around the lot that just looks terrible and distracting. Now, graphics don't make the game, I know, but since the graphics have been getting much better with each installment, I would've expected a nice upgrade for Sims 4. This looks more like a mobile or facebook game and the UI definitely adds to that look. I see no reason to play this if there's nothing new that sets it apart from other Sims games. Sims 3 had open world, Create-a-Style, oceans, huge graphics overall, gem collecting, sliders, story progression, traits, opportunities... what does Sims 4 bring to the table? Nothing except the pointless emotion thing. They took out pools, cars, toddlers and didn't keep any of their promises as far as I'm concerned. I do NOT want to go back to the closed in world of Sims 2 after getting used to open world in Sims 3. I don't know what they were thinking.\n\nGame lags on my PC too. I play Sims 3 on ultra and get +60 FPS, here I'm getting 30 and I don't know why.\n\nThis game needed another year in development for the gameplay alone. It's like they put all their time into CAS and house building and forgot all about the actual game. Also, no family trees either? Yeah, I'm out. I've already uninstalled this game and am going back to the Sims 3.";Backwards, backwards, backwards...
260;70.0;2.0;23.0;"In the past, I would start playing the Sims and immerse myself for 3 to 4 hours or more in the details of their little lives.  I can barely force myself to play this game for an hour before being bored out of my skull.\n\nThere's potential here.  I wouldn't mind load screens if you loaded up a neighborhood and then could move freely between the 4 or 5 buildings in that neighborhood, but a load screen for every single building is ridiculous.  And if you don't bring your whole household, the ones left at home are greyed out and you can't do anything with them.  I had a Sim randomly decide to go home and there is no option to have them come back to the community lot with the others.\n\nBabies are basically an object in your home rather than a person, then they magically pop into a child.  The child ages into a ""teenager"" in name only although they are basically indistinguishable from adults.  So if you liked building families, that's gone.\n\nCreate-a-Sim and Build Mode could have been really good if there weren't so few options available.\n\nEmotions have the potential to be fun, but are just a stupid framework now.  My sim is ""focused"" so he gets a boost to some skills, and special social interactions and whims to fulfill.  But the ""special"" whim always seems to be the same and the special social interactions are basically just Chat with a new name attached.\n\nThe camera controls are slow, buggy and counter-intuitive most of the time. You have to use the keyboard or put your cursor in the exact right spot to slowly edge scroll and you can only do a birds-eye view in build mode, no partial tint to actually see into small rooms.\n\nI could go on, but this is long enough.  Basically, this game will probably be fabulous in another 6 months to a year if I want to shell out another $120 in expansion packs and stuff content when it comes out, but for the first time ever in the Sims history, I don't think I want to.";Has potential, but it's basically boring and unflinished
334;71.0;2.0;23.0;"Bought the deluxe edition in Origin... got a refund. I never expected to be so disappointed with this game. It's very heartbreaking. I forced myself to play today trying to be optimistic and thinking it was going to get better.. just wait... nope.. reality sat in and the fact is, great new features but where are all the cool things sims 3 had?? No pools no toddlers. They explained that. I get it. They'll add it later....... I hope.......\n\nbut no color wheels? No recoloring and re-texturing of objects? Loading between sections of the same town? REALLY ITTY BITTY SMALL TOWN? NO town editing mode, a feature that has been since the FIRST sims!? Can't bulldoze, cant add or delete lots to the town, can't create a lot and mark it as commercial.... what the hell ea? I haven't been a fan since the original sims for this. I waited SOOO enthusiastically for this game.. I feel so sad right now. I told my husband: ""it's as if Skyrim released with great graphics but you had to zone into all the towns and had 3 quests.""\n\nreally sad... just really sad..... If in the next couple of years the expansions make this game REALLY worth it, I'll consider buying it then.. but so far, the game sucks. It's boring. There's not much you can do........ all the building customization options for no create a style??? Makes no sense.......\n\nI was willing to pay 70 bucks for this game. I have paid more for games with FAR more content than this game. Right now, 70 bucks feels like too much for what you get....";so heartbroken...
337;72.0;2.0;23.0;"I wish I hadn't pre-ordered and instead waited for the first reviews. I'm just so underwhelmed by this ""new and improved"" version. It reminds me of the more basic Sims 2 and just seems like a step backwards, at least at the base level. I like the new social/emotional aspect and the ability to customize sims' bodies, but everything else is just so LIMITED. I'm just bummed because I was so excited for this game and was anxious to play it, but my overall impression is ""Is that it?!"". I hope that future expansions make it better, but even then I'll be hesitant to shell out the cash to get them since I've already paid so much for so little.";Disappointed.
368;73.0;1.0;23.0;I have devoted thousands of hours to The Sims 1-3. Sims 4 feels like the incapable heir of a once-great dynasty. Aside from it leaving out basics like pools and toddlers and adding stupid objects that are fairly unsatisfying, the literal gameplay is just unenjoyable and flawed. For example, the edge scrolling feature is very sluggish and if you happen to land on a User Interface, which is like the entire bottom and top two corner of your screen, it will not scroll at all. It is screamingly frustrating.\n\nThe lack of an open world is also rather imperfect. At first I thought I would enjoy this feature, but after playing for about 10 hours I find that my Sims are not traveling as much as in Sims 3. Also, the multitasking, which I was extremely excited about, has turned out to be a pretty minimal occurrence. Also Also, while there are many new skills, they feel somehow less important than in past games.\n\nThis just hits on the key problems with Sims 4, but there are frankly a multitude that are too small to list. This multitude adds up to one extremely disappointing POS of a game. Time to stock up on Sims 3 content.;Sims 4 feels like the incapable heir of a once-great dynasty
400;74.0;2.0;23.0;I thought this game would be all of sims 3 and then some. Unfortunately I was mistaken. I find the controls hard to navigate and building is not as easy as it may seem. This game is more reminiscent of Sims 1 than its predecessor Sims 3. The game has no toddlers or babies like the sims 3. It has a crib with a baby inside and when it gets picked up it looks like an alien. I also do not like that the sims are locked into mini neighborhoods within the town and there is a go between screen when travelling to a community lot. Honestly Sims 3 was much better game play wise. The only shining star i have for this game is the ability to manipulate the sims in create a sim.;Sims 4 is a reimagined Sims 1
403;75.0;1.0;23.0;EA once again destroys a franchise. Totally and completely gutted. Absolutely no sense of accomplishment. Has even less to do than Sims 2. Why? To sell us back functionality in via DLC? No thanks. Greed, incompetence, more greed and a lust to destroy anything they touch. Just sick to my stomach. Thank god I was able to get a full refund back from Origin.;EA once again destroys a franchise. Totally and completely ...
169;76.0;5.0;22.0;"I'm writing this review as someone who has now logged over 100 hours on the Sims 4. Also, I've played all versions of the Sims (1-4). First, I want to say I LOVE this game. And here's why:\n\nMultitasking - This is one of the best features of the game and makes the gameplay flow as never before in any Sims game. In Sims 3, your sim could do one task at a time. In Sims 4, you can be doing at least up to 3 things at once and I'm pretty sure I've pushed that to 4. Example: Sitting on the sofa chatting to several friends watching a TV channel and eating some food. And I'll say that once you start a conversation, you don't have to keep directing what your sim says next. They'll just keep the conversation going on their own. So in that example, my sim is gaining cooking skill from watching the cooking channel, earning relationship with all the sims she's talking to and in those conversations (depending on what she does) she can be earning charisma, mischief, comedy (all skills in Sims 4). There are so many examples of multitasking that I could fill an entire review.\n\nPathing/Routing - They've fixed SO many of the problems sims had in the past with routing. No more having to build houses with a lot of space around objects to avoid pathing issues. They are 95% gone. No more having to build a 2 squares wide stair case so that two sims can use the stairs at the same time (one going up and one going down). In Sims 4, two sims can be going up and down a single width stair at the same time. My mouth dropped open the first time I saw this.\n\nSocializing - In past versions of the Sims, I've cheated my way through building relationships because I hated the social aspect of the game. Click for this interaction, click for that interaction, etc. just to keep the conversation going. And getting a group conversation going was just as tedious. With Sims 4, I LOVE socializing. I can direct the conversations if I want to or just sit back and let them chatter to their heart's content.\n\nNeighbourhoods - Many people don't like the idea that Sims 4 is no longer an 'open world' game. I, on the other hand, after playing it, LOVE it. The neighbourhoods are vibrant with sims wandering about, stopping to talk to one another, jogging (which you can just click your sim to go jogging and they'll do it all about your neighbourhood without having to click and ""Jog Here"" crap), use the objects available in the spacious public areas like gardening, children's play equipment, etc. This is a huge performance enhancement, in my opinion. The game isn't trying to render and keep up with an entire world, making it laggy. Now, it runs smoothly and graphically, it's lovely. Yes, there are loading screens between neighbourhoods and even residential lots. But I'll trade that for a massive improvement in game performance.\n\nCAS - Yes, we lost Create-A-Style. But we gained a much faster and more responsive Create-A-Sim (CAS). No more waiting for each clothing category catalogue to generate to change that one thing (like a wedding ring). Now, you can make minor changes in a snap and whether you use a mirror or a dresser, both go straight into CAS. You can also create up to five outfits per clothing category and your sim will autonomously choose one whenever they switch into one of those categories. Now your sim won't always be wearing the same stuff day in and day out because going into CAS was such a pain in Sims 3.\n\nBuild Mode - The new tools can take some getting used to if you're coming from Sims 3. However, after a few builds you should get the hang of it and for those who were intimidated by building in the past, the new build mode makes it easy for a novice to build a decent house. And did I mention you can move the whole house? The number of times I've built a large home only to discover late in the build that I should have started it further back or further forward, etc. Now, it doesn't matter where I start, I can just move it when I'm ready for the correct placement. There are lots and lots of build videos out there, as well, for Sims 4. So you can easily get educated on the new tools.\n\nYes, we're missing toddlers, pools and cars. But I'm confident they will be coming in future expansions and will be better than we've ever seen before. Seeing what they did with jogging, I'm hopeful that when pools come and you send them swimming, they actually swim and not just tread water (boring!). Meanwhile, I have plenty to do with the base game - careers yet to explore, aspirations yet to complete (and by the way, you can be working on as many aspirations as you like as opposed to one Lifetime Wish).\n\nPlease don't listen to all the haters who've posted reviews who haven't even TRIED it yet or those who've tried it for one day. If you're looking for a NEW Sims game, Sims 4 is it. If you're looking for a Sims 3 game with better graphics, then you'll be disappointed as that's not what Sims 4 is about. Nor should you compare a new base game with an end content version of Sims 3 with a boat load of expansions and stuff packs.";I'm addicted!
221;77.0;2.0;22.0;As a long time player of the Sims, I was very disappointed by the Sims 4. Here is my breakdown:\n\nGOOD:\n1) Mult-tasking: Sims can now multitask and in doing so, conduct themselves in a more natural way.  Now they can work out while watching TV, talk to another sim while cooking, and even read while sitting on the toilette.  The group conversations are vastly improved over group conversations in the Sims 3.  All of the animations associated with conversation and multitasking are pretty solid and this, for me, was the biggest improvement the Sims 4 made to the series.\n\n2) The Gallery:  The Gallery is much better that the Exchange from the Sims 3 store online and allows you to transport sims, homes etc that other simmers have built directly into your game, which is a great feature, especially for anyone who is not good at or does not enjoy building homes.\n\nGOOD/BAD:\n1) Creating a Sim, at least their body, is better than ever before in that it is easy and very flexible.  This feature, however, is muted by the fact that customizing hair, makeup and clothing is awful now.  In the Sims 3, the customization of hair, clothing, makeup was incredible and you could really come up with creative and exotic looks.  The patterns and color wheel in the Sims 3 have been removed in the Sims 4 and all you get is a paltry selection of preset colors.  Making things match is problematic.\n\n2) Building your home is also much improved and much easier for those who are inexperienced builders.  These improvements, however, are muted by the fact that customization has been stripped out of the game.  In the Sims 3 you can make everything piece of furniture match with whatever color or pattern you could imagine and that is simply gone now, which is incredibly limiting.\n\nBAD:\n1) Closed World:  The Sims 3 was an open seamless world, and although it was not without its problems, I much prefer to deal with a long initial load time than with the plethora of mini loads that the closed world of the Sims 4 throws at you.  Thanks to modders, most of the bugs in the Sims 3 were fixed and with my high powered machine, I don't have such a hard time running the Sims 3, so I don't have the typical problems that other simmers have with the Sims 3.  That aside, I cannot understand why EA did not keep an open world and just improve on it with better coding.  If Bethesda can make games like Fallout and Skyrim, which are almost completely open world with much more elaborate graphics, then EA should be able to code the Sims even better.  The closed world not only is incredibly limiting, it doesn't feel like a world at all and the load screens deter you were wanting to leaving you home.  You can't even visit your neighbor even though you can jog by their house without hitting a load screen.\n\n2) Story Progression:  Inactive sims have no stories of their own.  They don't work, don't get married, don't have kids. Nothing.  In the Sims 3, story progression made the world feel alive and a modder named Twallan made that Story Progression even more robust.  Going from a game where all the Sims around you are doing things and living lives and having kids that can become your kids friends, to a game where inactive sims are doing nothing is jarring.  Even intolerable.  If a modder can improve Story Progression for free, one would think that paid programmers could do the same instead of just tossing it out.  Course, EA would have to pay for that and paying for quality isn't their MO.  In the Sims 4, once inactive Sims die, that's it, their family goes extinct and they leave no descendants behind to grow up with yours.\n\n3) Content: The Sims 4 is stripped of so much content its unreal.  It is not acceptable to defend it because its just a base game.  All EA is going to do is release the same expansions they had for the Sims 2/3 again with nothing new or innovative.  Seasons, basements, toddlers, pools, cars, basic appliances, a downtown (with fully fleshed out functioning shops, bars, clubs, and restaurants) and all manner of venues should be in the base game (all missing in the Sims 4 among many others).  These are not fresh innovative ideas.  This isn't the Sims 1 anymore.  The town area in the Sims 4 is a joke and there isn't much point in even going there.  I have no problem with new expansions if they give us stuff we haven't seen before, like Sims 3 Into the Future, that was one expansion that had never been done in a Sims game.  They should be making stuff we have never seen before for the expansions, not stuff we are now so used to that they should be part of the base game.\n\nIf you have NEVER played the Sims before, you will probably enjoy the Sims 4 for a short time. Once the newness has worn off, you will realize how little there is to do and it will dawn on you that this game looks like a game made for Facebook or a tablet and that the only way it will ever get good is when you've spent an additional $500 on expansion packs and DLC to flesh the world out.  Even with that, EA will not take the time to test for bugs and you will have to rely on modders to fix the game, just like we did in the Sims 3.  I have 67 mods in the Sims 3.  Once we hit that point, you will need a super computer to run the Sims 4 just like you do for the Sims 3.  My best advice is that if you already have the Sims 3 and a ton of content for it, stick to that.  If you are new to the Sims, do not buy this game for another 2-3 years and wait for a bundle with 4-5 expansions in it to come out.  That or just don't bother allowing yourself to get sucked into the rip off money drain that the Sims has become because of EA.  Understand that EA has a monopoly on this type of simulation game.  No other such game exists and they know that people, like me, love it.  I've spent a fortune on the Sims 3 and invested a ton of time hunting down mods to fix the game and make it good because I love it so much.  I won't do that for any other game, but I should NOT have to do that.  If you just never get the game and never experience the fun it can provide, you won't get sucked in and you'll save yourself a ton of money and grief because no matter what EA tells you, they will mess the Sims 4 up even more even with expansions because they are awful at codding and you will need mods to make the game run well.  You should never need mods, especially not for the amount of the money you will be throwing at EA if you get addicted to this game.;I was very disappointed by the Sims 4
287;78.0;1.0;22.0;I really should have given it more time and looked at reviews before buying this game. But I let my love for the franchise carry me away. I've been playing The Sims since the first game and each new reboot brings something new and wonderful to the table... until now. I'm prepared to handle glitches and bugs, I've been putting up with them for years. But what EA has put out, it seriously looks and feels like a tablet game.\n\nThe good:\n- The emotions aspect is cute but isn't really a game maker for me\n- I like that you can adjust body parts individually in CAS\n- I like the looser grid style of placing objects\n- It's nice to have gardening as part of a base game (but I would have been willing to wait if it meant not cutting out more important things)\n- Time runs a bit better in this game, tasks take a more reasonable amount of time to complete, like being able to pee, shower, AND cook and eat breakfast before work. But also some things take a questionably short amount of time. Completing a large painting in a single afternoon? Really? That makes no effing sense.\n\nThe bad:\n- I don't like CAS. I understand that understanding a new system takes time but the controls are unintuitive and clunky. The fact that you can't choose any colors but the handful of options provided is bogus. Why would you ever remove create a style?\n- I hate all the hair. It looks plastic and awful. Not to mention the too-few color choices.\n- The neighborhood feels claustrophobic. After the open world of sims 3, to be squeezed into such a small space is insulting. I gather that it keeps the system running more smoothly, but there had to have been a better compromise between a full city and a single block.\n- I dislike the way the display looks and works. The left hand side is alright, but the right hand side is a joke.\n- There are quirks with the building mode that were annoying. (No instant roof? Really?) I understand the game just came out but EA is renowned for shoving through games full of bugs, to do so again with such a bare-bones game is insulting.\n- The amount of sims traveling by my house makes for easy socialization, but it makes no realistic sense.\n- I'm stuck staring at my empty house again while my sim disappears into the work void. Hello Sims 2?\n\nThe ugly:\n- There are no freaking firemen in the game! Why wouldn't you at least put that in the tutorial that you have to install sprinklers and handle the fire yourself? My sim burned her cooking, IMMEDIATELY caught fire, and then I had to watch her slowly burn to death as I realized to my horror, that no npc was coming to save her.\n- WHY WOULD YOU TAKE OUT SERVICE NPCS\n- NO\n- SERIOUSLY\n- WHY\n\nRegretfully, I bought a hard copy so I can't even return it for a refund.;I feel betrayed and I really should expect that from EA by now
290;79.0;1.0;22.0;"The problem is - the game will only get better AFTER you purchase DLC. Things that SHOULD HAVE been in the game was taken out - and EA is probably going to charge you for them, That for me is unacceptable. I've bought every single Sims from the beginning, and this game was a train-wreck. Yes, the sim creation was a great feature, the house building was too, but the create a style tool allowed you to make things  hundreds of ways different. Why would they take this out???? Babies, placing them back in the Sims 1 bassinet is such a huge difference from even Sims 2, being able to carry the newborn around - or even leave them on the floor! Then, when they age (you can age them the second that they pop out, which is weird in itself, although the Sims 4 was marketed on how WEIRD AND QUIRKY they are) they go from newborn to child. That is the weirdest thing ever. Sims is about life. It's about recreating stories over and over again in a almost realistc imagining of real life. So how they tried to explain ""no toddlers"" and ""no pools"" was unacceptable. The jobs were ridiculous, there isn't even normal careers except maybe chef.\n\nPROS\n\n- Played a little smoother\n- Emotions were cool\n- Multitasking was also cool\n- Building was smoother and easier\n- Create a sim was fantastic\n\nCONS\n\n-No open world. This is a big one, it is a definite step back from Sims 3. They might as well call this game 'Sims 1 HD' The lots were tiny, there were VERY few lots to pick from, and the downtown strip area was so boring it's not even funny,\n- No create a style. I'm sorry EA, I just don't like your color choices.\n- I felt ripped off because I paid 80.00 for the premium game, and I felt like 50% of what was in the base game of Sims 3 was in this.\n- No family trees. This is an issue because like I said the sims is a game about stories. Getting immersed in the sim's life, and family life. Though this isn't a major issue, it does upset me, and many others.\n-What's with the jobs? Why are they all these super specialized jobs? What happened to being a doctor? What about a businessman like Nick Alto??? Just saying.\n\nLook, I understand the argument ""It will be good when DLC comes out"" The problem is: I don't want to have to spend hundreds of dollars in order to make a good and not BORING game. This would be different if it was the first in its series, but it's not. It is a SEQUEL to Sims 3. I'd expect it to surpass it in everything, including the typical Sims 3 content. If they decided to release a new macbook, but took away many features from the previous, many people would be upset. That is my point. The game seems empty, and bland. And after playing it religiously since release, it just makes me want to go back and play Sims 3, or Sims 2.\n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't let anyone review it before its release is very sketchy. It feels like to me like EA decided to squander their fans, and release what feels like an unfinished game for twice the price it should have been.\n\nI'm just entirely disappointed in EA. I thought the Sims 4 was going to be better, and was looking forward to it for a long time, only to be very disappointed.";Just....not worth it, go play Sims 3 instead.
373;80.0;1.0;22.0;I'm not even going to waste my time writing a lengthy negative review because there are so many already out there that have already done it for me. My wife and I have played the Sims 3 since it first came out and have really fell in love with it so we we're really excited for 4 but all that excitement came to a screeching halt within about 30 minutes of installing. It's like they ditched all the good about the Sims 3, gave it slightly better graphics and called it Sims 4. Can't believe this game was even released in it's current state.;So dissapointed
428;81.0;4.0;22.0;Love this game. Ignore the negative reviews, and play the game to get your opinion first. People keep complaining about toddlers, and pools which has been known for awhile. The create a sim feature is awesome, and the emotions are great in the game. Building mode is better than ever, and very easy so I don't spend hours building my house like normal. People must forget sometimes that The Sims 3 had over 80 missing features from The Sims 2 also plus it is the BASE GAME. Is it my favorite in the series, no but it is way better then The Sims 3! It runs smoothly, and The Sims aren't robots. Hope everyone gives the game a try :);Actually play it first!
429;82.0;2.0;22.0;I've been a Simmer since the original Sims and I'm not impressed with Sims 4. I was so excited to start playing it at 9pm (PST) last night and turned the game off by 9:46pm, a whopping 46 minutes later. I ignored all the negative comments from other players prior to the game release, but wish I had listened. The controls are awkward, the interactions with other sims are difficult to keep from going side ways and the the new world layout is minimal. Diddo what the other reviewers had said about the game as well. No customization of colors and fabrics, and hardly any lots to choose from. Time to go back to the drawing board, EA. Wish I could get my money back!;Not Worth the Price Tag
103;83.0;1.0;21.0;"I don't think I'm going to write a review on this game. I'm sure by now many people have read or heard from both sides of the coin on this game. I'm simply giving my opinion based on playing this game and being a long time Sims player. Like many have stated, I have been a Sims player since the very binging, way back in 2000. I have very fond memories of playing that game, and was thrilled when the announcement was made for Sims 2! That game took the best parts of Sims 1 and enhanced them, building on top of it and making the Sims 2 a unique and entertaining experience. It was and still is an amazing game. Sims 3 was a positive step with it's open world, giving your sims the freedom of exploration, and freeing them - and you - from load screens. And the Create a Wheel tool was amazing. The level of customization was limitless! But all in all, the sandbox life simulation, in it's three forms was about family. You took your single sim through the stages of life. From getting their first place and job, to finding that ""One"" who they married, to watching them waddle around pregnant, playing and bathing their baby, and teaching their toddler to walk and talk. The times spend reading to their kids, and helping them with homework, to watching their teen learn to drive and accepting their high school diploma. And all that insures in between with all the joys and pains of life's little moments. Then we got Sims 4. it's a pale comparison to it's predecessors. And it no longer feels like a Sims game. The sandbox is gone. The family play is gone. It is now liner and goal driven. This is not what made The Sims so great. They took what made the series so awesome and flushed it down the toilet and replaced it with a beefed up Facebook game. I could only play Sims 4 for four days, and that was with me forcing myself to play. It's a repetitive boring game. The characters despite all their ""emotions"" are boring and shallow. And there is nothing there to keep me wanting to play them, to watch them evolve. The thrill is gone. There is so much wrong with this game, and if you take the time to do a Google search you will have no problem finding those problems. Lets just say that for now I'm sticking with my Sims 2 and Sims 3. That is what a true Sims game is all about. And I can only hope that EA will give us the true sequel, and next generation Sims game in the future.";Like many have stated
44;84.0;1.0;18.0;"I first got introduced to the Sims 3 game a few years ago and absolutely fell in love with it.  You could do so much in the game, ranging from exploring large worlds, to learning new skills (such as fishing and gardening), tryout out new jobs, and engaging in all out crazy social behaviors that most of us wouldn't dare to try out in real life (without ending up in some psych ward), etc.  It was a touch of real life, but with a great sense of humor.  You could come home from a job and enjoy relaxing with the Sims, trying out something new and wacky.  Oh, the crazy social relationship experiences that one could explore and have with the Sims!\n\nHowever, when EA released the Sims 4, I quickly discovered that they greatly changed this experience; they made some nice improvements, but a lot of the fun is simply MIA (missing in action).  First, what's good about the game:\n\n1) Stability improvements.  The game seems to crash less, which is a huge improvement compared to the previous edition.\n2) The graphic engine is an improvement, giving the Sims and the world an improved appearance.\n3) Multitasking - Your sim can now surf the web while using to the bathroom, etc.  Table conversations (when eating) actually look like real life conversations.  The multitasking is probably one of the biggest improvements for this series.\n4) Some free enhancements have improved the game, such as restoring back swimming pools, etc.\n\nWhat's wrong with this game:\n\n1) Missing Open World\n\nThe open world gave you the feel that you lived in an actual community.  You saw your neighbors driving off to work in the morning.  You saw the family take group trips to the beach or the library.  Parents would drop off their kids to school, or the kids would ride home from there on their bicycles.  People walked or jogged around the community neighborhood, dropping by to say hi at times as they passed by.  Neighbors moved in and away from the town.  Burglaries could happen; strikes would occur; police would patrol the neighborhood and local park.  You developed friendships with them, invited them to parties, baked homemade goods for them, and they became like family ... or your worst enemies!  ;-)  You felt like you were a part of their world and vice versa.\n\nIf you loved the outdoors, you had a huge world to explore.  You could hike the hills or have a picnic with the girlfriend with a fantastic evening view of the moon-lite bay from the top of a forested hill.  You might find a pink diamond and carve it as a wedding gift for the one you loved.  There were canyons to explore, ancient writings on walls, lakes to fish at, gardening to do, etc.  There was a TON OF FUN to do in the Sims 3!\n\nThe lack of the open world means that everything happens in a RIDICULOUSLY small shoe box.  For example, if you go to the library, that's the only part of the world that you're allowed to experience.  It is a small, crowded room with a few tables and bookshelves with very little room to navigate.  It reminds me of shopping in a hectic store during the holiday season.  You feel like screaming at the people, ""Get out of my way or I'll run you down with the shopping cart!!""\n\nTake your girlfriend to the library and you'll find it be almost an impossible experience to do anything socially with her, as a ton of sims seem to be automatically programmed to do nothing more than randomly ""bug"" you or her constantly.  It feels like you went to the swamp and every sim there in the room there with you is a pesky mosquito that needs swatted into submission.\n\nThe LARGE, open world was what made the Sims 3 so much fun!!  Without it, it's a small shoe box with very limited opportunities, unless swatting pesky, mosquito-like Sims is your type of enjoyment.\n\n2) The world is FLAT...\n\nOne thing that I loved about the Sims 3 is that you could rise or lower the land, creating dynamic landscapes that were very beautiful.  You could create the sunken gardens, or build ponds with exotic fish in them, etc.  Now, the world is pure flat and you're very limited design-wise as to what you can create.  You had hills that you could climb to the top of and have picnics there with the girlfriend, etc.  Oh, what a romantic view!  Nope, it's all gone, because the planet is now pure ""flat"" ... and boring.\n\n3) BUY, BUY ... AND BUY SOME MORE!\n\nThe game feels like they redesigned it to be primarily a perpetual shopping experience, than an entertaining game with actual substance to it.  I get greeted with buy this, and buy that messages when I start the game.  The focus seems to be on BUY, BUY, BUY, ... than let's have a fun and rewarding experience.\n\nJust to be fair, I have purchased a variety of the Sims 4 expansion packs to see if the game would improve.  Nope.  I've come to the conclusion that I'm done with buying expansion packs / stuff for Sims 4.  Maybe Sims 5 will eventually be worth considering again.\n\n4) The game feels cheapened on so many levels.\n\nThe Sims don't seem very intelligent in their behavior.  It feels like the game just picks crazy, random event to happen to sims, such as a granny suddenly doing push-ups in the middle of the crowded library lobby.  Huh?!?\n\n5) The worlds are very small and cheap feeling.  No police station, fire department, city hall, hospital, etc.  No striking at the town hall, or bumming out at the beach / park.  It just feels like a rushed to market after thought...\n\nIf I could give it 0 out of 5 stars, I would.";If ZERO stars were possible...
24;85.0;2.0;15.0;We are not really happy with the way the game has to have internet connection all the time. It is always trying to update and requiring to be connected. The whole point in paying for a game is so you can play it without it costing you more in the long run. The game it self is fun but having to update and connect to internet sucks. We live in a roural area and our data is limited, so we do not like having it using for stuff that should be able to run at least a week without having to connected to internet. We would not buy this again and frankly from what I understand the company that now produces these games have made all new games this way. So basically we will be trying to find all old games that were made before. 1993 or whatever.;Too many updates needed.
339;86.0;1.0;21.0;I Am so incredibly disappointed in this game.  You might like it if you have never played the sims before, or it all you have played is the Sims Freeplay app.  If you loved Sims 2 or 3 you will be bored in about an hour.  Feels like EA took this franchise back to Sims 1.;I Am so incredibly disappointed in this game
346;87.0;1.0;21.0;DO NOT buy this game! It is a total rip off. I would give it no stars but I don't have that option. They to out all of the control and graphics,  you can't customize your sim or your house, there are some many limits on way you can do. They are just trying to make money on expansion packs that will come out later. What's the point. Save you money;DO NOT buy this game! It is a total ...
356;88.0;1.0;21.0;I was going to write some long, drawn-out report on why you should not purchase this game, but there are plenty of those already. I am mostly here to drag down the rating in hopes that less people make the mistake of purchasing this game.\n\nJust know that if you purchase this you have a 24-hour window (from when you first start playing the game) to get a refund. So sure, give it a try if you'd like, think of it as a 24 hour free trial. Kind of wish I knew that when I got it. -$60, grr EA.;Depressing.
394;89.0;2.0;21.0;"I am a HUGE Sims fan and own every game/expansion.  Sims 4 however I would consider to be a very basic game.  I wouldn't consider this game an upgrade from Sims 3, just more of a side step. Sadly this game did not deliver. There isn't much to do and the only thing really ""new"" to the game is allowing the Sims to have emotions.  Fun for a few minutes but this alone does not create a fun long lasting game environment.  Initial loading times and graphics though are really great!  Downfall, every time you want to visit a new lot you will be subject to a loading screen.  No free world.  This game took one step forward and ten steps back.  At this point you are better off with Sims 3 and grabbing expansion packs while they are cheap.  Maybe once Sims 4 gets some expansions it'll be worth the time.";Not as fun as it looks
396;90.0;2.0;21.0;I have played every Sims game the past 10 years of my life. This release was a huge disappointment.\n\nPros: The graphics of the Sims are beautiful and the social interactions are unique.\n\nUnfortunately that is all the game really is right now. No wonder the marketing for this game sucked. There was no game to market.\n\nCons: Buggy/glitchy unpolished and unfinished feeling.\nFeels more like a console game and less like a pc game.\nThe lighting is horrible.\nThe camera controls are awkward and do not work properly.\nFor the price the game is LACKING in content.\nI was bored in 5 hours.\n\nPerhaps I will attempt to play again if they offer the game for cheaper or add some amazing expansions.\n\nSad. EA destroys games.;BORING. Lacking in content.
223;91.0;1.0;20.0;Let me start by saying that I am a long time Sim player. I've been playing since the very beginning when they were basically just walking sticks and their babies just randomly appeared in a basket a couple days after a woo-hoo. When the newbies were the very first house you ever played because it was the tutorial. You get the point.\n\nI am so disappointed in this game, not only because the numerous details that they have taken out and will no doubt put back into an expansion pack and charge you 50 dollars for, but because I feel like it was a huge downgrade from the sims 3. The graphics in my opinion are awful, they don't look like sims, they look like cartoons.\n\nI will say it seems to be a little bit smoother and their voices seem a bit more realistic.\n\nThe create a sim tool which is supposed to be the main selling point in this game is just aggravating. It's not that easy to use and you end up grabbing and morphing a body part when you don't mean to. I could definitely do without it.\n\nNo open world?? Again, what was EA thinking. Just awful.\n\nI know there are several people who don't understand why people are so pissed off at EA for releasing this atrocious version of the sims, but any true sim fan will NOT be happy with this game, it's a slap in the face.\n\nIf you want my opinion, stick to the sims 3 or 2, both are fantastic, but the sims 3 is more advanced than the 2, especially with graphics.;If it's not broke, don't fix it.
349;92.0;1.0;20.0;There are too many game-breaking bugs that make this game unplayable.\n\nThe only thing the game has going for it is that it runs fast.

19;93.0;3.0;13.0;"TS3 was so much better... The Sims 4 is a nice game; it definitely has some improvements from TS3, but it's missing A LOT of stuff! So much more than toddlers! No burglars, no video game consoles, no police (unless you buy Get To Work, where your sim + co-workers are the only cops), no outdoor activities (like frisbees, balls, sprinklers, slides for kids, etc). This game is missing a lot of stuff that was found in The Sims 3 base game, which makes it a huge step back and downgrade from the Sims 3. There are also very few traits! Sims 3 had tons of traits, Sims 4 slowly adds with every expansion and game pack, but there are so few traits, and few life goals. It limits game play, in addition to the closed world. The thing I like about TS4 is the cartoony look of the sims, and the new emotion. But otherwise, it really is a downgrade from TS3 and I regret buying this a bit. I hope as time goes on, they'll update with a lot more content via expansion packs. It's a shame to have to pay more for what's already expected, but better than nothing...";Downgrade from TS3, but not the worst.
209;94.0;1.0;19.0;Literally The Sims 2.5. Some improvements but not nearly enough to justify everything that they took out. If you're into genetics, the family tree, story progression, or the legacy challenge then this game will be your worst nightmare. Each time there was a new Sims game release I'd spend months playing it, putting in hours upon hours. This is the first Sims game where I've played it for about 2 hours and lost interest entirely. Tried to give it a second chance a day later and just... so boring. Really disappointing as this used to be one of my favorite game series.;Don't waste your money.
312;95.0;2.0;19.0;Much like everyone else has said, this game went back in time essentially. Honestly it's like playing a sims game for consoles. It's so basic, with just about nothing to do. No open world, no normal careers, no pool, no toddlers. They tried to hold out as much as possible just so they can more than likely charge more for it at a later date. I'm so tired of this company. They just ruined The Sims and SimCity franchises. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game until the price goes down or they come out with a deluxe  edition combined with a couple expansion packs because it's a horrible game right now.;The Sims 2.5, or the The Sims for consoles
371;96.0;3.0;19.0;"I recently deleted my initial review because after the initial excitement of the new sims game wore off, my impression changed. I still don't think it deserves 1 star, but there are a lot of pros and cons. Luckily I haven't experienced any bugs yet.\n\nPRO's:\n- Body shape customization. I love how there are more options for body shapes, facial features, etc. to make sims even more individual.\n- Walking styles. Although this doesn't really affect gameplay directly, some of the styles are pretty amusing.\n- Multi tasking! I absolutely LOVE this one. Instead of eating then watching tv, they can now do both at the same time. That is one example of many. I'm pretty sure my sim also called someone while using the bathroom but I'm not 100% sure.\n- Quick load/save time. BUT the downside is that there are more load screens :(\n- Click and drag. There is still edge scrolling but you can now click and drag the screen to where you want to go.\n- Achievements. So glad they kept these!\n- Pregnancy tests. I like to listen to music when playing but I always had to stop and listen for that stupid chime to see if a sim was pregnant. Not anymore :)\n- Cute clothes/accessories. Although you can't change the color, I like the styles.\n- I like how it looks. I don't know if it's more realistic, but it seems simpler and I like that.\n- More detailed aspirations. I like how there are checklists for their aspiration levels. The sims 3 did this to an extent but I think the made it more specific in 4.\n- Build mode is fun, I like how there are some pre-made rooms.\n- Unlockable content when you reach certain skill levels.\n- The community lots actually have plenty of sims in them. I found this to be a problem with TS3, the community lots were almost ghost towns.\n- Easy to switch between worlds\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- Career choices are fun/interesting, but there aren't very many of them to pick from.\n- No toddlers or pools. Don't miss toddlers but I do miss pools.\n\nCON's:\n- Community lots seem a bit underwhelming. There are very few and not a whole lot to do, but you can definitely meet some new sims.\n- The worlds are super small.\n- No custom colors. This is one that I miss. You are stuck with the colors they give you.\n- No more open world. You have to let lots load like it was before Sims 3.  You can still scroll around a bit, but if you want  to visit someone you will get a load screen.\n- A lot of the same. I don't see a whole lot of new stuff. Although the emotions of the sims can help in some situations, I still don't see why that was the focus of the game.\n- PRICEY. It looks like the developers are leaving a lot of content for expansion packs. This game should be about $30.\n- Apparently there are ""restricted words"" that won't allow you share families on the exchange. I named a character Dick and apparently that was a no-no. I figured with the wife being Jane they would get the reference... Oh well.\n\nIn the end I'm not unhappy with the purchase, but not happy. Definitely a 3 star for me.";Good and Bad.
372;97.0;1.0;19.0;A huge disappointment and yet another example by EA of huge hype bordering on deception without delivering.  It's more like an upgraded Sims 2, certainly not a step forward from Sims 3.;A Huge Disappointment
162;98.0;1.0;18.0;"Seriously I was waiting for this game for months. I was expecting something huge and unbelievable. Sims was fun, Sims 2 was better; Sims 3 was amazing so I was expecting Sims 4 to be a totally new experience. I thought Sims 4 will have everything that Sims 3 had plus things that we were missing and everybody was asking for. What a disappointment. I feel like they released this game prematurely. They knew people were waiting for it and will pay for it so why not give them something Some people are saying that maybe the expansion packs will have these things that were used to and by paying for the expansion packs you will get the full experience. I don't know though... After such a disapoittment I don't think theres a way they can make it better for me. First of all the weird and annoying navigation when you're in the Sims live mode. I am used to easy zooming and moving throughout the lot. I find it very annoying they changed the way you navigate. Its very hard to get used to it. Secondly where is the variety!!??? The neighborhood is so tiny! The third and most important there is no open world. I feel like going back in time when I was playing Sims 2. I remember how amazed I was when I got one of the expansion packs and with that expansion pack you were able to go out to the city, to a restaurant or a gym. Back then I was amazed, but that was in 2004 when I was fourteen. Really How am I supposed to bear waiting for the screen to load. Why cant I just watch my Sim go to the restaurant instead of waiting for the screen to load? I have no words for this game Sims just lost of its biggest fans. One of many. If EA Game thinks the only new feature, that Sims feel happiness, sadness etc. will satisfy us. They took away major parts of a game and they gave us one little new piece and said here, be happy, we made one change. Sims 4 is officially dead for me.\n\nI do not recommend buying this game!";R.I.P Sims 4
184;99.0;1.0;18.0;Game is boring so I sold it.  Guess what!? You can't transfer the crappy game to someone else so I suggest you don't buy a used copy.  Last time EA gets any money from me.;Last time EA gets my money
225;100.0;2.0;18.0;"Abridged Version / TL;DR: The Sims 4 is a throwback to TS2. It pretends TS3 never existed. I don't recommend buying this at $60-$80. Wait on a sale if you're really interested, or buy it on Origin since they have a Great Game Guarantee policy where you'll see your full investment returned to you if you don't like it within 24H of starting the game.\n\nTS4 is primarily a base game only in that there is virtually nothing more to accomplish than the following things:\n- skill ups\n- job progression\n- being social with NPC's\n- fulfilling aspirations\n\nThere has been some additional functionality added to the game:\n- Sims can now multitask (i.e. talking while working out)\n- Dinner chat has been brought back similar to its original presence in TS2\n- Your sim can now carry on a large group conversation by interacting individually with other sims (when you initiate any social interaction with additional sims your sim will bring another into a conversation so group chat is much easier)\n- You can change your life aspiration at any time during the game\n- You now have a search function to find objects by typing in what you want to see\n- You can now travel from town to town (I call them towns, I think the game still calls them worlds)\n- You can unlock special objects and items by reaching specific goals in game (this is the same as TS2 and TS3, such as obtaining a permanent police cruiser by reaching level 5 in the law enforcement career in TS3 or gaining a special object for maxing out a skill)\n- objects can be resized\n- Wants/Desires are still in the game, they're just in the form of thought bubbles above your sim icon's head now.\n\nThen there are little things or details that have been removed.\n- Sims no longer use sink faucets, dishes or hands being washed simply enter the basin which fills with soap, then come out of the basin.\n- Everything comes from the fridge again like it used to in TS2, with the exception that now you can no longer order food to be delivered, you just pay as you go.\n- Food prep happens only with some meals. Sometimes your sim just grabs a chopping board from the fridge and overturns it into a frying pan, cartons and all.\n- While visually there ARE vehicles in the game, there are none your sim get into. It's much like the town exterior where there are just ambiance objects that fill what would otherwise be void space.\n- Each town is broken into a partition that you load into. It's about a block long, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. However, even if in that little partition there are 4 houses, if you click to visit a neighbor the game goes to a load screen, even though you can run down the block (again within that partition) without having to load.\n- You now disappear offscreen to go to work just as you did in TS2. There are no interactivity options to affect job progression such as working hard or meeting workmates.\n- There are no services anymore\n- object CAS is gone, if you're not satisfied with the provided object colors you'll have to either download a 3rd party program to do your own recolors or ask someone in the community to hook you up. There doesn't seem to be any movement on behalf of EA Maxis to create an official recolor tool like the one available for TS2 at all.\n- The more real world detail provided by TS3 is replaced by a cartoony look. Everything is simplified visually, including object geometry (Sorry to say, the world textures remind me of the upcoming reskins in WoW. I don't hate WoW, I just wish everything didn't use it as a baseline.)\n- Some of the more mundane jobs once available in TS to TS3 have been changed or removed, with some new ones added (for example you can still join a culinary track but there is currently no medical track derivative)\n- from Teens to Elders, there are very few differences between. All of these lifestates have the same heights and look similar, much different from the lifestate experience in TS3\n- There is no story progression right now. What this means is that unless you interact with other families they won't have children on their own or anything else. I don't really know what that means for the town population over time.\n\nThere are emotions. Emotions are essentially an extension of the mood meter in TS3. They add to your sims mannerisms and how they interact with the world. For example if something makes your sim angry and you tell them to make lunch they're likely to snatch the fridge door open or slam it shut. Or if something causes them to become uncomfortable or tense, they might get to rubbing their temples or the back of their neck. Sometimes they become inspired or confident when things are going well. Honestly none of this is really new. If you've played TS3 I can compare these things to the moodlets you receive when a sim visits the art gallery or the gym. Remember getting an inspired moodlet for a time? Or having the fit atmosphere moodlet? It works in the same way; you get a bonus to corresponding skillups.\n\nAt the end of the day this list looks a lot longer than what it actually means when you're playing the game. My experience... honestly it hurt to play this game in its current state. It's not the same sims that I've played in the past, and that's fine (I'm not upset not having the huge open world mostly because I hated having to keep an eye on more than one sim when they were separated since NPC sims can't be trusted to behave), but this new sims is naked at best.\n\nAlso I love to make my own recolors. Now I have to download Color Magic and get a plugin for my Nvidia card just to export something that crashed my game more than it satisfied my vanity?\n\nCurrent value not worth $60 for me.";I'd watch and wait.
271;101.0;4.0;18.0;"I've been playing the Sims ever since the Sims 1. My favorite Sims in the whole series was the TS2. I can honestly say, I could never bring myself to love TS3: there are so many problems with it. It was extremely glitchy, even with the patches and updates to this day, the load times were horrendous, all the community lots were practically empty, it would take forever to save and quit, it it would crash every time I would play. Open work was a good concept, but again, it made loading/traveling times TERRIBLE. My computer is a gaming one, and I can play my games on ultra graphics with little to no lag so I know when I had all of these performance issues with TS3, it was the game, not my computer.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy TS4, more than TS3. The build mode and CAS are incredible, the loading times are amazing, and I love the graphics. The first house I built was stunning. There are so many new build options and I want to say it is probably the nicest house I've made in a while on The Sims. If you're butt hurt over not having toddlers and pools, open your eyes and see all of the wonderfully added improvements. If you're blinded by the fact that two, practically useless, things were taken out to add other beautiful improvements for a BASE game, I advise you to open your eyes and actually take the time to use all of the tools and features added. Yes, I enjoyed pools (mostly for decorating reasons. Did you REALLY make your Sims go swimming all the time? Really?), but I don't mind not having them. As for toddlers, I'm happy they are out. They were more of a pain for me than anything fun, but every one has their own opinion.\n\nIf you haven't bought the game, try it for YOURSELF. Don't listen to these reviews, because the majority of them are people complaining about toddlers and pools, and that there ""isn't enough stuff"". Have these people ever played The Sims series? Base games have little to no ""stuff"", TS1,2, and 3 were bland at first. Give it a shot. If you can appreciate what improvements EA has done with the game, you surly won't be disappointed. If you're unwilling to see these things and continue to cry over toddlers, pools, and open world, don't even bother.";Give it a chance before you judge
273;102.0;1.0;18.0;Don't waste your money - this game is missing tons of basic features (toddlers, dishwashers, pools, seasons, pets, alarm systems, being able to call the fire department when you are on fire!)  Send EA a message by not buying it.;Do not waste your money on this unfinished game!
295;103.0;1.0;18.0;What an absolute crock of s***. Do not waste your money on this poor excuse of a game, you may as well just go and buy the sims 2 as that is basically what this game is. The sims 2 remodelled. Such a massive backward leap by EA on what could have been incredible. We are back to babies in a basinette that appears with them like in the sims 1, no toddlers, all of the children's toys are so big that you need to have a vast ammount of space to have them, dolls house now takes up 4 squares... They've missed out simple things such as the dishwasher, trash compactor and food processor as well as massive things such as no more open world, hello load screens again (such a shame), no pools and thanks to the new 'multi tasking' it now takes sims aproximately 2 hours to eat anything because they always talk or watch TV while eating... not great when you have other needs to take care of too. On a positive note the pregnancies are more realistic, no more suddenly spinning into maternity clothes, you only find out they're pregnant from clicking on the toilet and having them take a pregnancy test. While they're in labour they can still walk around and do stuff which is good too... but so far those are about the only positives I've found as I think the graphics are bollocks too, the grass now looks like it's a messy watercolour painting that's run into itself... All in all, terrible. F*** you EA.;Bare bones piece of crap. Waste of money.
305;104.0;1.0;18.0;So many people have already voiced my complaints on here. I don't have much to add. The game is horrible. I would give it an extra star for the improved CAS, but CAS is such a small part of the game for me. I like to play big families and I frequently send two or three sims to different lots, bouncing around to play them all. This game kills my style of play. I'll keep my eye on the expansion packs, but I doubt even a pets/generations/seasons super pack can make me leave sims 3. (I missed Create a Style immediately. So many awesome features are missing!)\n\nKeeping my fingers crossed for sims 5....;I really wanted to love this game :(
333;105.0;1.0;18.0;* Before I even start my rant there is something that needs to be said. If you are a newcomer to the sims franchise do not make this your first experience with sims.\n  It truly pains me to write this. I was one of the few that went into this game with a positive attitude. I have grown up with the franchise and I still actively play. I loved CAS from the minute I got the demo and was willing to look past all the negative press and shell out my $60.00. Now I'm thinking of all the things I need that my money would have been better spent.\n  After two days playing I can honestly say for the first time ever that I'm bored.. At first I thought I was just spoiled from all the sims 3 expansions .. But it feels like the sims 4 should have come out before 3 and that's very sad. The loading screens are getting more tiring by the minute and despite stripping the game to run on any PC I find mine already freezing and glitching for short periods of time (and my laptop is relatively decent but overall does run well tbh).\n  I really tried to like this game. I love the clothing, the hair, and even the emotions I find entertaining. However, so much has been taken away the game it  honestly feels like a glamorized sims 2 minus the content. The lack of family tree, open world and story progressions was the nail in the coffin for me. I can't believe I'm saying this but I even miss watching my neighborhood turn into fairies and celebrities despite the annoyance, these were the kinds of thing that gave this game life and character.\n\n  So I can honestly say I really regret pre ordering this. I should have listened to all the other gamers boycotting it- but I didn't. I hope EA for once reads how much they have upset a very devoted fan base and so SOMETHING to fix what they have done. I will not be purchasing an expansion packs anytime soon and that breaks my heart because I really looked forward to this game.;EA takes a HUGE step backwards with this game
412;106.0;5.0;18.0;The first thing I notice when I started playing was just how natural all the sims interactions are now.  The sit, stand, drink and eat all while having conversations.  They can work out and converse or sit on the bed together and talk.  It's a total reworking of the task oriented sims in the past.  The old Sims games feel quickly obsolete.  That being said, I appreciate the revamping of the sims, but their quickly needs to be followup to fill in the missing venues, objects, pools, etc. The world is small now, but it can grow a lot more than the Sims 3 worlds. In the sims 3 the world was limited to the single map.  In the Sims 4 each expansion will be able to link to all the existing neighborhoods so you virtually have an unlimited size world.  The Sims 3 was alway frustrating cause you ran out of lots so quickly.  I'm giving it 5 star because even though its a basic base game,  the change in direction has a huge amount of potential.  You just keep finding so many things that make it new and more fun to play.;Great Gameplay,
67;107.0;1.0;16.0;In their attempt to prevent any sort of unauthorized use, EA has, as usual, ended up limiting its customers far too much. My family has one computer this game is installed on, which anyone in the family might, at various times, want to use the game on. This seems reasonable, right? But since the Sims 4 requires you to use an Origin account to play the game, and we don't all have the same Origin account(and really don't want to have to create a new account for every new game we get), this means that exactly one person actually CAN play the game. It's pretty ridiculous. Then you get into the actual gameplay, and are confronted by a HUGE step back out of the seamless, one-world navigation of the Sims 3...the limited content in some ways will be remedied by future expansion packs, I'm sure, but the return to a never-ending cascade of loading screens is a pretty basic level of limitation that is unlikely to change. Even the most die-hard, Sims-addicted member of our family played a few times and then returned to the Sims 3. We've purchased every Sims game or pack that has come out previously...this game is likely to stop at the base game and gather dust. Boo, EA...very poor choices and treatment of your customers.;Disappointing on every level
191;108.0;1.0;17.0;"I did not want to believe the reviews. I wanted to believe you were all a bunch of whiners, upset over the loss of toddlers and pools (neither of which fazed me much).\n\nAfter playing this game over the last couple of days, however, I now know that you were all right.\n\nThis game is an insult to The Sims. This game is an abomination.\n\nIf you are new to The Sims games, you may actually enjoy playing this. That is because, quite simply, you are blissfully unaware of the gloriousness of The Sims 3. As for the rest of us - I think a more adequate title would have been ""The Sims: Back to Basics.""\n\nFor those of you who condone this stripped-down version of The Sims - shame on you. I have seen numerous commenters argue that all we have to do is ""wait for the expansion packs."" You people are the reason why companies like EA succeed. They have presented to us, after five years, a $60 letdown of epic proportions, and you are arguing that we should spend more just to get basic things.\n\nAs for the pros, of course there are some. Create A Sim will get your hopes up from the beginning. The ability to stretch and pull your sims' bodies is a great addition. The characters do look quite cartoony, but I did not find that to be offensive. The emotions system is a good idea, although I do think that some aspects of it are ridiculous (such as being able to take three different kinds of showers to completely set your sims' moods).\n\nThere are many, many things missing from this game, but they have, for the most part, been listed in other reviews. One thing I have not seen complaints about are the sims' pregnancies. I found it to be really boring. Your sim can hardly care any less that she is pregnant, nor can the person who got her pregnant. There are no doctor appointments (there are no doctors, period), no parenting books to read, no massages to make her feel more comfortable.\n\nEdit: Can someone please tell me why my sim child did not care that her own father had died? The girl was at school while it happened, and she and her sister came home unfazed. It was only when I had the girl ""mourn"" her father's urn did she feel sad. And it was ""at the loss of a friend."" Ouch.\n\nI got bored playing this game in a day. I was not even angry, at first - just really sad. The fact that The Sims Facebook page has now been censored says enough to me about how the fans feel about this game.";Letdown of Epic Proportions
254;109.0;1.0;17.0;Horrible... I'm so sad and disappointed in this game. It's definitely a downgrade from the Sims 3- like others have said, what's the point? The buy and build modes have such limited options and the loading screens to get everywhere are a pain too. I've purchased almost every Sims game and expansion since the original, and I can honestly say that I won't spend one more dime on this product.;Downgrade..... why???
261;110.0;2.0;17.0;"The only pro to this game right now is that it runs more smoothly than Sims 3 on my computer. I've been playing Sims since 2001 and this is the first time I've been legitimately annoyed while playing. The ""emotions"" change way too often to where I feel like my sim is a moody teenager. I had to use a couple  rosebud cheat codes because buying the cheat items means all you are doing is keeping their needs met, not building any skills or socializing - or earning enough money to get better stuff. I expect that the first hour or two, but not after playing a few days. The new home building feature is okay, but I built some walls without using it and the game didn't want to recognize the rooms as being indoors, despite having a roof. I also can't figure out how to create floors on the second level where the game hasn't already put them. It's not as intuitive as one would think. My sim has held countless parties and gone to many places around town and has only been able to make one friend, so far. So I'm stuck in level two of my career because despite having the highest work performance for a (sim) month, they can't advance until they have four friends.\nThis game has none of the innovation that Sims 3 brought. I feel like I'm playing basic Sims 1 but with better graphics and whiny sims. I don't know what they were thinking. It's like they got tired of people being creative and having fun and wanted to go back to making us watch someone pee, shower, eat, and sleep every 15 minutes.";Keep playing Sims 3.
272;111.0;1.0;17.0;This game is SHALLOW.  A joke compared to Sims3.  Boring after 3 hrs.  Save your money.;Dumbed down beyond all reason
276;112.0;1.0;17.0;I've played the sims since the beginning in 2000. I read all the reviews and reserved my finial opinion of the game until I tried it. I played for around 6 hours. Not only does it miss features included in previous base games, the overall game feels incomplete. Now I know that expansion packs will come out and that is to be expected from EA. When I say incomplete I mean basic things are missing (ex: lineages and repair man).\n\nYou won't mind the loading screens as much. Why? Well your sim only has a few places to visit. Don't want a bar, museum, library, or gym? Too bad, because that is all your town has. The careers are downright silly. Sure it is good to have some fun careers but to get rid of business, medical, and law enforcement? No toddler stage or story lines, that really changes the way I play. If you like building, be prepared to be disappointed. The tools have been simplified, and the lots you can choose from are all small. I'd recommend buying it from a place that allows returns, as that is what I ended up doing. Save your money and buy Sims 3.;Great! If you want Sims 1.5!
279;113.0;1.0;17.0;"The Sims 4 is appalling. I played this game last night for about 2\nhours and was so utterly disappointed. This game shouldn't be allowed\nto be a part of the Sims collection. I felt like I was playing\nsomething on Facebook or Iphone. The neighborhood views suck and are so\nimpersonal. I don't like the fact that certain lots are grayed out\nwhen you go to start playing a family. That is just so old-fashioned\nand ghetto lookin'. There is nothing special about it. At least in the\nSims 2 and Sims 3 you felt like you were actually ""in something"" when\nyou would go to a neighborhood view, which gave that particular\nneighborhood a ""feeling"" or ""personality."" You don't get this in Sims\n4. The display of neighborhoods is like something out of the 1980's\nAtari games or something. SUCKS!\n\nI will also say that the\ncharacters/sims are annoying. What's up with all the gibberish and\nmuttering that they constantly make? I was so put off by them that I\nhad to turn down my volume!\n\nAlso, I searched all night long for a\ndish washer to add to the home of my Harry Potter and Ron Weasley sims'\nhouse! I thought I just couldn't find one, only to find out that they\nhad never actually been made! What a ripoff!

282;114.0;2.0;17.0;"I'll start with a blunt statement.  The Sims 4 has the least content of any Sims game at the time of launch since the original.\n\nI will warn you.  If you go from the Sims 3 with no expansions, to the Sims 4, you will be stunned by how little there is to do.  Some of the expansions for the Sims 3 have far more content than the Sims 4 does.\n\nI'll try and give a quick list of the issues:\n\nNo Pools\nNo Cars\nNo Open World (you jump from lot to lot)\nTiny Worlds (Apparently they saw nothing wrong with the tiny SimCIty maps)\nSevere lack of places to go.\nLimited Skills\nLimited Jobs\nToo Few Traits\nFloating Roofs\nCrashes more often than a hammered Lindsey Lohan on a go-cart track.\nBugs\nBugs\nBugs\nBugs\n\nOkay the good things:\nMoods are okay\nMultitasking is a nice add on\nParts for upgrades has potential\nLooks great\nWhen it doesn't crash, or kick a bug, it's runs okay.\n\nOverall it feels like I paid $60 for a demo.  No, a demo would be functional.  I paid $60 for a BETA Demo.\n\n*** UPDATE ****\n\nThe 9/11/14 update of the game made it much more stable.  The update before that, took away the demon babies.  The game is now playable.  I'm not adding anymore stars.  The game still lacks an enormous amount of content. Even though one of the updates added a few items, it's still no where close to a good value.\n\n*** UPDATE #2 ***\nI figured it would help people to actually see how much is missing from this game.  Here is a list of the items.  Remember, these items are comparing the BASE games.  When you first see this list you figure it must include some of the Sims 3 expansions.  No it does not.

304;115.0;1.0;17.0;Don't waste your money buying this game. This game has less of everything than even the basic version of Sims 3, which severely limits the increased in graphics and character improvements. It comes with two worlds which come with a total of 17 lots in each world, including already used lots for places like parks, gyms, etc. Houses have a total of 12 lots, with 4 unbuilt lots. A huge decrease from Sims 3 and greatly inhibits growth and generational play.\n\nDon't waste your time with this game until several expansions have come out, then if you want to shell out over $100 for the game and expansions, then go for it. But right now, stick with Sims 3;Huge let down and waste of money
314;116.0;1.0;17.0;Extremely disappointing.  I was waiting for a long time for the Sims 4 to come out, only to find out there is basically not much more to it than the SIms Mobile App I had on my phone.  Don't waste your money.;Completely disappointed.
332;117.0;1.0;17.0;"This is a terrible game there's only a few good things in this game; one of which is the create a sim and the graphics are better and the build mode is fun with the pre made rooms but there are no cars or garages yes you read that right no cars or garages you can't build a house without a garage right? Also there's two towns with very limited lots. in the two towns there's 3 little neighborhoods with 2-4 houses that you can actually move into and there's a little shopping area I don't even know or understand what it is but you can't even see where u work u just teleport from ur house to somewhere u cant see and then teleport home I also don't even know how to play this game i just don't know what to do or where to go not that there is really any places to go and there's very limited things in the buy mode also you can't get access to a color wheel and pattern maker to customize things like in the sims 3. This is all coming from a sims player who's had every expansion and stuff pack since the sims 2 DO NOT waste your money on this game";Very disapointed in EA Sims 4 Failure
376;118.0;1.0;17.0;Less than an hour in and I'm board, returned the game yesterday. huge step backwards.  I don't feel it stands up to sims 1. simple features are missing to this games.;Less than an hour in and I'm board, returned ...
48;119.0;1.0;14.0;"Updated. I hate this game even more even with mods and cheats it is still boring and so limited. Again. I am only giving it a chance because I paid too much money for it.\n\nI still do like the game just a tiny bit and that is only because of what you can do in Create A Sim and some more detailed interactive content that I wish was in SIms 2.\n\nThough they may have seemed like a great idea before but emotions are overrated and very annoying. Come on, why is she NOW tense from a fire at a neighbors house that happened an hour ago? Depending how your Sims are feeling you have to stop everything and go off and do something just to appease their emotions and it is a waste of time because you're only going around in circles. It's hard enough building skills and relationships without have to drop everything to go and kick a trash can on the far other end of the park. That's only a tidbit.\n\nContent, as far as design. I still don't know what Maxis is doing. Why does Maxis still have a problem putting together color schemes and proper furniture sets? I don't know where to begin with that but nothing matches or go together. Everything looks 2D while the Sims are in 3D if that makes sense. However, I do like the way you can arrange decorative items without the diagonal cheat. So basically I liked the design tools.\n\nGame play wise everything is at a stand still all the time. It's still amazing how you can do so much and it amounts to so little.\nI still can't believe I bought this game for this amount when Sims 2 was cheaper and you got more out of it. Even the Sims 2 base game alone was enjoyable. The amount of content that was taken from this game is ridiculous. What content they took out were these to name a few; police, firemen, repo man, nanny, toddlers, aliens, telescopes, burglars, the ability to customize lots, family tree, basements, they added the pools back in but they are still limited for example no diving boards and there's so more gone. It may not seem like much but these features had content that came with them that made them and the Sims game more fun. Which this game is not. I wish they instead of releasing this game, delayed it and made something great out of it and not leave stuff out just to charge customers for it later at a high price. I would gladly pay 60 dollars for Sims 4 if it was worth it and not lacking the basics that was even in Sims 2 base game.\n\nOrigin is another story. It took 24 hours to install, each and every time. I purchased this back in Dec. 2014 and I don't know how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled Sims 4. Too many times I think. I know I've uninstalled and reinstalled this game so many times I've threatened to break these **** disks. This last time (around July) Origin updated itself and then I was no longer able to play the game so I uninstalled it. I had no choice, every time. I just reinstalled it (Aug. 30th) and this time around I make sure not to be online so it won't update otherwise I have to deal with it breaking again. I've played a total of 25 hours of game play since buying it and that was last year. Origin as a game launcher just sucks. I don't see the purpose of having to be online to play a game I purchased that's meant to be played offline. I don't care about somebody else content if I want it I would download it myself.  I'd per fer the old Sims launcher anyways. This is the last time I'll ever buy anything regarding the Sims 4.\nSo anyone interested I say, save your money instead and if you still have your Sims2 or Sims3 games just install the downloads, mods and programs for any new content you want and there you go, you've just made your own Sims4 how it should be.";I thought this was suppose to be an updated version of ALL the Sims games and then some.
161;120.0;1.0;16.0;Ended up getting my money back. Let me put it this way, if you love The Sims 3, stick with The Sims 3. This game was a major disappointment to all fans who wanted the next generation of sims to build off of the amazing gameplay of the 3rd installment. If you like Sims 2, maybe you will like Sims 4? I can't say. Be prepared to have the open world concept taken away from you along with most of the items and interactions you enjoyed in the past, like the toddler stage, swimming pools, and even the sort of job goals we were given in The Sims 3. The emotions are more annoying than innovative. I want more freedom, not more simplicity. Sure, the house building is amazing but if you want to pay 60 bucks for an architecture game, be my guest. But the gameplay is so poor that I just couldn't stand knowing that I wasted my money on it.\n\nI was looking forward to this game as much as every other fan, but now I guess I will go back to playing The Sims 3 because at least there I can get more than 2 hours of gameplay before becoming extremely bored.;Waste of Money
171;121.0;1.0;16.0;I wanted to like you...I really did.\n\nBut you disappointed me. Sorry, but it really is you, not me. You made these wild promises and just never delivered. You profile picture did not match up to who I met with in real life. Sims 4, you just seem like a liar. You took me out to dinner, but in the end, I had to pay. Looks like my relationship is over and I'm going back to my ex, Sims 3.\n\n Sorry, but not sorry EA.;I think I have to break up with you...
8;122.0;3.0;5.0;Sims 4 is cool because you can make your sims do new things they've never done before, and you can really customize them as individuals and tune into their varying personalities, in so much more depth than ever before!\nHowever, you're confined to your Sim's home and you lose the ability to customize their lives (clothing patters, furniture, vehicles, etc.). You also lose some classic features when interacting with different objects.\nThe additions in Sims 4 are really great, they truly are, but I would not ever play it over Sims 3. I wish they could have kept all the awesome things about Sims 3 and enhanced it with the emotions and whatnot from Sims 4.\nI extremely disappointed that I spent $60 on this when it came out. It was not at all as I was expecting.;Disappointment
210;123.0;2.0;16.0;"I've played Sims 4 for less than a week, and I'm bored with it already.\n\nI played Sims 3 (and 2) for years, built hundreds of houses and community lots, and even my own custom world in CAW. When I installed the Sims 3 base game and ventured into the open world, it felt amazing! The neighborhood felt alive. Story progression meant that my neighbor sims had lives of their own that I would discover when my sim got to know them. My children went to school with their children. I made friends with my co-workers and visited their houses. One of my favorite activities was to have my sim jog all around the neighborhood and off the beaten path, following her with the camera. She never gained weight. I wished real life could be like that, that I could jog everywhere without getting run over or mugged.\n\nIn Sims 4, my sims spend their time eating, sleeping and working. Any free time they have is taken up with fixing all their broken appliances and honing their work skills outside of work. If they try to hone their skills at work, they suffer a job performance loss. Sure, they can ""chat with co-workers,"" but there aren't any actual co-workers. Gardening is a full time job. The garden boxes have to be watered, weeded, sprayed for bugs and fertilized constantly. I visit my real life garden allotment once a week for a couple of hours. I would go more often, but there's a loading screen (haha).\n\nMy sim has already gained weight, because she can only jog back and forth in front of her house or go to the gym (loading screen + boring interior full of Stepford sims). My sims didn't have time to go on a date before aging up, so they had to try for baby without even getting flirty perks. I have a feeling that dates in Sims 4 would be a series of point scores just like the parties. Not fun. But I don't know, because there's no time to go out unless one sim skips work. My sim has made exactly one friend, and he'll soon age up and disappear from the neighborhood. My sim won't even be able to visit his ghost.\n\nI don't need to go into the 89 missing features - those have been covered in blogs. I hadn't read about them before trying Sims 4. I was willing to give it a go. What I'd hoped for was a better Sims 3, one that took advantage of my blazing fast pc (that's two years old, even), and incorporated the bug fixes and mods that made Sims 3 even more fun to play. What I got was more like an app that people diddle with on their cellphones while multitasking.\n\nI want my money back.";Sorely Disappointed
274;124.0;1.0;16.0;The emotions are fun.  That's about it.  They basically went back to sims 1 and added emotions.  Got rid of create a style, toddlers, pools, open world.  The news babies are uninteresting and mine is a deformed monster due to some glitch.  When you get married they don't even move into your house.  Now my people won't use the doors or about half the appliances.  In response to complaints they say they will be putting out expansions but I don't want to pay $40 to add small details that should have been included.\nEA should be embarrassed and ashamed of this game and due to the backlash of sim city I would have thought they would have put some effort into this game.;terrible
275;125.0;1.0;16.0;This game sucks. TS3 and even TS2 where way better upon release.\n\nBut you can get your money back within the first 24 hours..\n[...];Sucks. Worst game of 2014
283;126.0;2.0;16.0;So disappointed... as somebody who's played the original Sims, Sims 2, Sims 3, and all of the expansion packs, Sims 4 has been an extreme disappointment. We can all thank EA for that...;Disappointed
286;127.0;1.0;16.0;It's beyond belief that anyone gave this garbage a 5/5. This game sets a new record for being the worst in the series, and I can safely say it was the worst game I've played this year so far. In fact, it's probably the worst game I've played in quite a few years. The game is missing far more than just a few items, its missing major major features. I'm not going to go into detail about everything it's missing, if you want to see a list Google it, there are plenty, but I will say this: I am a big Sims fan and I remember rating The Sims 3 on release day, I gave it a 4.5. Sure it removed a few things from the Sims 2, but it added so much more it was still an awesome game. But The Sims 4 only adds one noteworthy feature, the emotions system, which honestly isn't that fun anyway and gets boring REAL quick. I gave this game a 1/5 and I would give it a negative 100/5 if I could, it's that bad!!! The game is trash and anyone giving it a 5/5 is either an EA employee or an EA fanboy who hasn't played the game and just thinks its good because it's a Sims game! I played it, I'm a big Sims fan and I hated it within 20 minutes! This garbage wouldn't even be a good expansion to the Sims 3, nevermind a new game!!!;Worst Game of the Year
319;128.0;1.0;16.0;EA did it again! Ruining SimCity was not enough for them so they had to ruin The Sims, too! There is just too much missing from the game to even justify spending $60 on it. There's no open world, no toddlers, no big lots, no pools, no story progression, extreme clipping, all the hairs look like Lego people hair, too many loading screens, Disney movie graphics, and the list goes on. This is not the squeal to the Sims 3, but more like a sequel to The Sims 2. Do yourself a favor and just stick with The Sims 3 it's 10x better.;Garbage....
341;129.0;2.0;16.0;"First off, I NEVER write reviews unless my emotions are very strong. In this case, I'm very disappointed in the newest Sims game. Even though I purchased the game off Origin (pre-ordered it even), I figured my review would be more read on Amazon.\nLet's start out with the positive features. Create-A-Sim runs much more smoothly. I love the fact that you can push and pull features, bending them to your will. This makes it much easier to create Sims that look like certain people. Clothing options are much more vast! I've been playing the Sims 3 ever since it came out, and the clothing options get quite boring after a while, so the new clothes in this version made me very happy. Now on to Build Mode. There seems to be more options out there, including rooms that are even stylized and you can just plop them down onto your house and they're already coordinated for you. I can see how that would appeal to people who don't like to spend time decorating a house. New appliances, decorations, furniture, wall decorations, and accessories are there all ready for your choosing. That was what I was looking forward to the most, was the new clothing and building options. Now on to game play. Emotions! Something that has never been done in Sims before. In earlier Sims you could just see what their moods were depending on a bar that ranges from low to high. Now there are a range of emotions that your Sims can feel. There are also actions that derive from those emotions, giving you extra points when you complete those actions.  Also, there's multitasking! That's pretty cool, considering you can make your Sim read a book while going to the bathroom (which I'm positive we all do). are all features that I find positive and new, something that we could all enjoy.\nNow time for the negative features. I almost feel as if the Sims corporation has reverted back to their old ways of Sims 1 & 2. Now comes the most devastating feature missing (in my opinion): unlimited world features. Grocery stores, book stores, fire stations, spas, etc. Gone! Completely erased from Sims 4. Now the map has literally 4 or 5 options that you can travel too: Library, night club, gym, a museum, and a park (not even a very good park either :( ). This is what made me want to come and write a review, is having this feature completely gone. With this being gone, I almost stopped playing. Also, when going between destinations, there's a completely different loading screen. No more getting into your car (yes, they got rid of cars, too) and just driving to work, you have to wait with a loading screen. Did I mention no more cars? I spent at least a couple minutes searching for parking spaces and little cars that my Sim could drive to work in. Also gone: pools. For some of us (including me), this might not be a huge deal. But, I figured I'd include it because some people love their pools. Next thing to be eliminated: Create-A-Style. I know plenty of us (including me) would spend HOURS looking for that right color combo for our furniture and clothing (even hair and accessories). No more finding the perfect pattern for your sofa, no more finding the perfect texture for your blouse; left now is a set choice of colors that the game has provided you with (not even good colors either..). Hair options seem to be more differentiated, but you can't change their colors with the color wheel anymore. You must choose from a color that has been added to the game by EA. This was also a huge staple that was missing. I also noticed that I couldn't find dishwashers, laundry machines, trash compactors, etc. Next up: toddlers. Apparently you go straight from being a baby to being a child, which means no more teaching them how to talk or walk. This option may not be something that everyone does, but I usually lower their free will so that I won't have to worry about them doing stupid things. I noticed while playing that my Sim tends to quit doing what I asked it to do to go do something completely different. Having to always cancel these unwanted actions is a little tiresome.\nI'm sure there are things that I'm missing in this review, more positive things, things that are missing, etc. These are just the options that I noticed more prominently. EA seems to have cut back on a lot of options, making the game easier and quicker. I'm sure a lot of us LOVED sitting down and creating the perfect dream home and Sim to go along with that home. Now, things have been chopped that reduce the time to make a house and the quality of the house being made. Not having an open, free world is what really REALLY upsets me the most. I honestly loved grocery shopping and looking for new books, even going to the spa and movie theatre. I am seriously hoping that Sims comes out with new updates and add-ons that might add these features to the game. As it goes, this isn't a TERRIBLE game...but it seems they have taken two steps back on gameplay. If you read this and find those negative options not to bother you, then by all means, go out and play. But, for $60, this game doesn't seem to be worth it. I might even consider asking for a refund.";Very Disappointed.
343;130.0;1.0;16.0;This is the last EA title I purchase -- EA releases half finished products and expects you to pay a full price in addition spend 100s on DLCs for simple stuff that exists in a previous version.;The Sims 4 will actually cost you 500$
359;131.0;1.0;16.0;So many bugs, removal of a lot of thing that carried out within sims series such as just a dishwasher,toddler,pools are all missing. The game seem like it was put together just to continue a game. Sims are not that smart and half of the time you the player don't know wat there doing. It's like sims 2 with emotions and multitasking. Sims 2 really offer more than sims 4 to be honest.;Very disappointed
367;132.0;2.0;16.0;I am a die hard Sims fan! I was excited to get this downloaded it and when I finally started the process of making my Sims I was highly disappointed. Yes you have all of these options to make the perfect sim, but it seems a little excessive in my point of view not very user friendly like the previous versions. The one big thing I didn't like with build a sim was when you go to change there outfits to formal, workout etc you have to redo there makeup and hair depending everytime you switch outfits in creation mode. Plus when choosing a career aspiration they are not as great as before. You also cannot make the people fiance or boyfriend and girlfriend it is either married family or nothing.\n\nNow in the game you have two worlds to chose from with maybe two in each that your sims can start out in not big towns or amazing like the previous versions. So after you get into your house your turtotial still continues without being able to disable it. You get these awesome notifications on the top right corner of your screen that you cannot disable oh boy they get old fast. And the new menu layout is not user friendly at all.. for your sims needs etc. you need to click a button and a huge box pops up on the bottom right and on the bottom left is a huge picture of your sim and there thoughts.\n\nBuild and buy mode ehh it is ok. Many more paint colors which is a plus! But many of the old features and even clicking on items are very glitchy still sometimes I will click on and item and it won't work and I have to play with clicking different spots to get the item. The lighting is a little hard to see some times too unlike the previous versions where you can make it lighter out. The big things that are not fun in this are the camera angles are not cool at all you have to constantly move it with buttons and not easy like before. Lastly when buying furniture you have to keep right clicking an item to turn it instead of the normal arrows.\n\nOverall I think it is ok for now I do not see myself being addicted to it like the previous sims versions I might go back to those if anything. They should have stuck with what worked and upgraded the graphics and items that people can play with;Ehh.... maybe not
17;133.0;1.0;10.0;"The game itself was barely OK. It didn't have much that was redeeming. It took away some things I liked a lot from Sims 3, and it added too many items to try and compensate for the poor game. I did like the rocket ship, except for the fact that it got repetitive after the third time. It would just keep on repeating the same scenarios. The most redeeming part of this game might be the Create-A-Sim, except it took away some of the clothing options and it didn't allow for a singular lifetime wish. The ""lifetime wish"" in this game was pretty much just a set of tasks you had to fulfill, and in many of these they overlapped, so you could easily skip through them. The needs and emotions of the characters were often sporadic. Additionally, I was scammed with this originally. I had bought the game, and was hoping to play it, and the discs were in the case, but then it turned out I also needed a game code as well. Seriously? I'm given two discs, and it still doesn't work without a game code? The second disk does not seem to have much of a purpose, anyways. Additionally, this game can not be played offline, and you pretty much have to have a mouse to play it. If you try it without the mouse, it is extremely difficult to actually see what's going on or to control your character. This game can't be played offline/without wifi because you need to download Origin in order for it to play, and in order to log in to Origin, you need wifi, so it can confirm your login. That really pissed me off, as I had to completely download Origin. It wasn't like I was just using the browser of Origin, and that would start it. I had to completely download it, and it still wouldn't work offline. Additionally, in order for this to work well, you need a pretty good computer. I used a Toshiba laptop that I've had for a few years, and that game took 4 hours to download. Honestly, I feel like the game could be relatively good, but all of the requirements of the game make it terrible.";It took away some things I liked a lot from Sims 3
10;134.0;2.0;6.0;I really enjoy playing sims and that is the o my good thing I got from this. I bought the disk version because i wanted to avoid having problems installing that game, i got the package and it had the disks BUT the disks could only be used on windows (i have a Mac and i got the version for both Mac and pc). This really annoyed me because I had bought the dusk version just so I wouldnt have to try and input the code, but ended up having to use a code anyway.;Good game, bad application
64;135.0;1.0;14.0;"I've been playing sims for several years, starting with sims 2. I was incredibly satisfied with the new works of sims 3 as far as graphics, open world, cars, etc. open world was the best thing that EA could have done. I was super excited for sims 4 but when I started playing, I played for maybe an hour and I haven't touched it since. Completely and totally dissatisfied with the this. There's loading screens like Sims 2, no cars, not even a toddler stage for when your sim has a baby. Straight from baby to child. The emotions are absolutely annoying because they change so quickly and the special ""whims"" disappear so soon. I hate how everything is set up and there's NOTHING to do in the worlds. You basically get up, meet your typical needs (eating, hygiene/bladder, sleeping) and that's it. That's your day. You can't even follow your sims to work or change how they're working like Business as Usual, Take It Easy, blah blah blah. Maybe new updates will make things better but so far I am absolutely disappointed.";Not impressed
108;136.0;1.0;15.0;"Sorry... this game is a joke. A HUGE step backwards. Where the heck did all the careers go? No access to your Sims info panels while they're at work... really? WAY less customization options for everything (clothes, furniture, etc). WAY less for your Sim to do. Friends come bug you every 10 minutes. The ""multitasking"" makes for very awkward pathing.\n\nJust terrible. I'd have more fun going back to Sims 3 or even 2.\n\nWtf were you thinking, EA???";MASSIVE step back!
12;137.0;1.0;8.0;sims is just going down sims 3 way better love them more;One Star
202;138.0;1.0;15.0;I finally got to play Sims 4 and have been playing on and off for about a week.  I just can't play more than 30 minutes at a time because its downright boring.  I don't like waiting on the loading screens.  I don't like not being able to just walk around the map and visit neighbors.  I realize that this is just a basic game and that there will be more expansions to come that will add more content.  However, I am not content with the basic content provided.  When Sims 2 came out it was basic but it wasn't dull.  Even more so for Sims 3.  Sims 2 and Sims 3 completely changed the game play with their new game play elements.  Sims 4 does NOT.  All my Sims in Sims 4 do is talk with each other.  Their new emotions aren't very entertaining either.  Yeah, they get mad, or whatever but a lot of times its for no good reason and the moods often wear off before they begin.  Also, the sandbox element of Sims is what I most enjoy and I think it would be harder to  create situations and stories with these emotions.  Lack of an open world is a huge disappointment.\n\nI also dislike the fact that that there isn't a Create A Style.  This was an amazing feature in Sims 3.  Now we are back to two or three color choices for every item.  No longer will my different windows be the exact same color.  No longer can I put a pretty pattern on a couch and also a run or another decorative element.  Sad.\n\nEven knowing the game limitations, I thought I would have fun playing this game.  Sadly that is not happening.  I am gong to return to the Sims 3 and hurry up and buy any sets from the Sims 3 store that I don't have and want before that goes away.;Just Plain Not Fun
241;139.0;5.0;15.0;This game is amazing.  Yes, it doesn't have toddlers or pools but it has so much other stuff.  Sim3 base game had 4 careers.  Sims 2 had 6.  Sims for has 8 plus each of them branches off into two different paths, so effectively 16 career paths.  Sims 3 had a color wheel which was cool, but sims 4 has tons of designs and actually different items of clothing.  I'm blown away by the level of customization.  No, you can't make your shirt match your couch, but you do end up having way more options.  And they have seemed to have done away with the sims store and brought back a gallery where you can share your creations.  So, no more paying for each individual thing you want in the game.  Also, you can finally make different races.  The customization on the sims is actually really crazy.  There are also a lot of different aspirations which branch off into 2 or 3 categories (romance sims can actually choose between wanting to sleep around and wanting to find true love finally).  You can even change your aspiration at any time.  You can also switch between households pretty seamlessly if that's what you want to do.  There are even multiple options in regards to aging.  The emotions really do effect game play alot.  All in all, the graphics are amazing, the performance  is awesome and for a base game there is actually a ton of content. I wonder if the people complaining about this game even remember playing base games sims 3 because this is so far ahead of that.  It seems funny to me that the same people who had no problems buying sims 3 and paying for all the expansion packs plus mods plus individual items from the store are angry that they may want to buy one or two expansion packs for sims 4 to add to the few content items that aren't there.  Sims 4 really is a solid game on it's own though.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm all about making families so toddlers is one of my favorite life stages but I don't even miss it yet because there is so much else in this game.  It's WELL worth the money.  Much more so than previous sims games, honestly;This game is amazing. Yes
258;140.0;1.0;15.0;Have been a Sims lover since the very beginning, I thought I could get past no pools or toddlers but they've downgraded the game so much from Sims 4. There are some really nice aspects of the game which is a shame, but overall it's a terrible game that is definitely not worth sixty bucks. Don't waste your money.;Disappointing, don't bother buying this game.
259;141.0;1.0;15.0;Do not support this garbage. EA basically took a Sims game and took out half the features to sell to you separately. Seriously boycott this pathetic company!!;Warning not a full game!!
269;142.0;1.0;15.0;"For being a sims fan from the very beginning I will have to say that I was very disappointed of 'The Sims 4"". I will start off by describing my first impressions of this game so far. The graphics are very nice and create a sim is quite handy. I like how the sims seem more realistic by multi-tasking. But unfortunately I have more cons to say about the game instead of pros. I am not impressed of the two new neighborhoods. They are cheesy looking when you see them in world view and it is not very big and beautiful like it was in the sims 3. The neighborhoods do not have a hospital, grocery store or even a spa parlor. The other thing I might add is the controls are very awkward. It takes a lot of my time while playing the sims just to get from point A to point B and it is very frustrating. The part of the Sims 4 that I am very disappointed with is that there are no toddlers, pools, cars and no family tree. I hope this game gets better with expansion packs or something to spruce it up. I know until then I will be playing ""The Sims 3"". If it were up to me I would give this game 0 stars!";EA has failed the Sims!!!
316;143.0;5.0;15.0;There is a lot of negativity with this game.  Yet everyone I know personally that plays this games loves it as much as I do.  I'm hear to say be careful reading the negativity.  Yes there is stuff missing form the previous games, but don't forget this is a starting game.  I remember Sims 3 was the worst starter game in the series and still think that because it was lacking so much.  Not to mention that game crashed several times on me and took forever saving and closing the game.  Sims 4 has not crashed on me once, very few glitches, and saves faster.  The graphics in this game are at it's best too.  Yes they look cartoony, but I like that feature better because the hair doesn't look like a mess and there bodies don't look plastic.\n\nCreating a Sim is now a lot easier and a lot more fun then the previous games.  NO SLIDERS!  I don't like the fact that you can't choose any color skin/hair/eyes for a Sim, but I can deal with that.  I love  the fact you can make a Sims body look like almost anything now.  You still can't adjust their height, but I can live with that.  I love the fact my Sims can look more stylish.  Like I said you can't really choose every color, but there are plenty of styles and colors to choose from.  Honestly the color and styles from the never impressed me because again they looked plastic.  Plus this time woman finally can have Afros and the curl hair looks a lot  better then what  3 gave us claiming it was curl hair.\n\nThe building mode is my favorite.  You actually can build a better house.  No more annoying auto roofs and there are more options for building a roof.  The best feature though is you can move an entire room with taking anything away.  Like if you mess up were you place a room, just move the entire room somewhere else.  Just need to read add or add doors and windows.  My only complaint about the building is the controls.  Takes time to get use too.\n\nThe other big plus to this game is smart Sims.  They actually can multitask.  They can sit on the toilet and read.  They can talk while working out.  They even can talk while watching TV.  Makes it a lot easier to be social.  Like in real life. The is no open world in this same, but I like that.  People tend to forget that in 3 the open world made the game run slower.\n\nSo should you get this game?  Unlike some review I'm seeing on here I'm going to say it's really up to what you want.  Do you want a game with better graphics, faster saving, better game play, and smarter Sims?  Or do you want a game with a lot of content, yet runs slower. Some people aren't getting this game or giving it back because it doesn't have much content.  Which is fine cause it's not your taste.  But don't rush  the hate because this is only the first game of the Sims 4 and we don't even know what the expansion pack will give us.  If I recall a lot of the stuff people are complaining it doesn't (expect for pools) were introduced in later games.\n\nOne this is don't get CD.  I'm still going to have it  handy just in case, but all you need the CD for is to download the game.  You can play the game without the CD this time.  I suggested downloading the game on Origin.  Not sure if there is a price difference or not.  Other then that I really love this game.  And yes I have been playing the Sims since they made there first or second expansion pack for TS1.  Then got every game and nearly every expansion pack.;Honest Sims 4 Review!  Should You Buy This Game?
320;144.0;1.0;15.0;The game is too stripped down!  The game has problems with clipping as in sims just walking through each other and objects. The sims themselves look ok but, the background world looks like they are standing on the set of Dora the Explorer.  There are no toddler life stage, open world, Create A Style. It is like a mixture of Sims Social with a mix of Sims 3 for Android.  It looks and feels like a cheap facebook game. I returned the product and so did my niece.;Just not worth it.
322;145.0;5.0;15.0;"No toddlers? Thank you, Maxis! It was always so irritating to deal with babies and toddlers so much that it was ALL you were doing and your Sim spent all their time meeting all their needs. Very realistic for sure but I did that in real life and I play games for fun not reality. I always just ended up aging them up to a child as quick as possible.\n\nNo pools? They were nice to make your property cool and pretty. But having your Sims swim in them was about as exciting as watching your Sim bicycle across a big open world map to work.\n\nBut anyway let's focus on the fact that this is Sims 4 and not Sims 3. A new direction. The create a sim is really great and easy to use. I love the cartoonish style graphics. I do admit I miss the ability to create some crazy outfits using all the patterns and the color wheel but I can manage without it and actually spend a lot less time creating my Sims and more time playing the game.\n\nI was nervous about a loading screen everytime my Sim changed venues but it is just a few seconds and is so much better than the waste of time of watching them travel or wasting all their energy running somewhere. Like I said I am a casual gamer though.\n\nThe whole interface seems a lot more crisp and clear. I like the whole emotions idea and how it gets me to play my Sim based on how they feel at the moment. I don't have to of course but  it is much more fun than always playing just to meet your needs or to increase skills or get a promotion.\n\nOh and my favorite part that got me stoked about Sims 4 was when my Sim was double fisting a milk and a coffee while watching tv and talking to his friend. It could only be better if he was holding two beers :) The multi-tasking is a great feature. I haven't seen it yet but I sure hope my Sim can chat with someone on the phone while sitting on the toilet.\n\nThis is a fun game. Give it a chance\n\n**I wanted to add that while I like the emotions, they can tend to shift around very quickly at times. Maybe my Sim is just overy emotional...or nuts :P\n\n***Update: After getting some more playing time this weekend I will add some new things I enjoyed about the game and even some issues I had.\nI really enjoyed the fact that you can bake your own cake for your birthday party. I had to learn this through my own research however after searching through the items list for a birthday cake and finding nothing.  I also really enjoy that you are given goals to accomplish to make your parties and dates better. It always irritated me in Sims 3 when you were given a bad party or date rating and had no idea what you did wrong.\n\nOn that same note I like that you have goals to help gain promotion at work rather than just boosting skills related to your job and going to work with a good mood. In my tech job, I have to do things like ""mod a game"" and I think it is very cool that I can work on job related things while chatting with house guests or even send someone a text. Also I think Sims 3 simply had a smiley face to represent your job performance. Sims 4 gives a much more clear progress bar on how things are going at work and this seems to change pretty accurately based on how you perform out of work tasks and the way you choose to work when you get there. Work hard, take it easy, leave early, etc... I didn't notice this option at first. It is a bit difficult to notice at first. Not sure if I missed it in the tutorial but i figured it out eventually.\n\nNot sure if this is good or bad but depends on your game style I guess, but it seems like there is no noticeable affect for being late to work. If my guy is supposed to be to work at 9, he usually doesn't even leave until 9 and sometimes if I'm doing something, he doesn't even leave until 9:30. At times it seems like time flies by while at work, almost to the point you forget to adjust how you want to work that day. Other times it seems to go a bit slower like in Sims 3 and I wonder if that is related to the fact that I am clicking around looking at things. Also I noticed that you can't check your needs or click ahead on what you want your sim to do as soon as they get home while they are at work. I don't really love or hate this but it is a noticeable difference.\n\nI had one major issue where my son had started a sim and took my sim to the gym with him. When I restarted my game, it started at the gym but I couldn't find my sim or click on anything. I gave up on it slightly angry and quit the game. When I went back to it later, my sim was back in his house with all of his needs at 100%. Also I had a ton of friends i didn't know about and some of the chicks I was hitting on were now elders. Not sure how well it works having 4 of us with different families in the same sim world and playing at different times but I know we didn't have that option in Sims 3.";Perfect Sims version for a casual gamer!
327;146.0;1.0;15.0;I've played the sims game since the original version came out. And I'm just wondering if this game is a joke? Way too much money first of all, and sure the create a sim and stuff are not bad but the game is pointless, it seems like they have reverted back to the original game, there are no interactions with babies, no toddlers? I think they focused way too much on customizations and less time on actual game play. They took out all the best parts of sims 3 and leave you with a completely boring game.\n\nNot really sure what they were going for with this game but I just don't like it.;So disappointed.
342;147.0;1.0;15.0;Really am lost for words, if a refund was an option I'd be happy!\nThe games plays so bad I felt like it was a chore playing the game!\nI'm not expert at developing games but this lacks so much imagination after all this hype it's very disappointing!\nHas EA said anything about all these negative reviews?;if a refund was an option I'd be happy! The games plays so bad I felt like ...
358;148.0;1.0;15.0;Do yourself a favor and just load up the sims 2, it's the same thing but with slightly different (not really better) graphics.;such a step backward
389;149.0;1.0;15.0;To bad EA has such a good marketing strategy, a lot of people will be suckered into buying this dumbed down sim disgrace....I was looking foward to another sims, just like I was looking foward to the new Simcity when it came out, but just like that, the disappointment in gameplay and rule of EA has destroyed yet another once great Maxis creation.;Another Sim bites the dust...
391;150.0;1.0;15.0;Very disappointed. Played around with it for a few hours and I've got to say they have managed to rip the heart of this game out. They is little I'm not disappointed. Even building a home is somewhat limiting and this was my favorite things in the previous versions. I really don't see me getting anything further for this game in the future, I'll stick to The Sim 3. I just glad I didn't have to put up much of my own money for this. Not sure what they were thinking. Sad.\n\nUpdate\n\nThe more I play this game the more I'm disappointed (Why I've given it more time is beyond me, call me hopeful). It is defiantly several steps back for the series. It seems more like the first Sims with better graphics and I few added features, but not anywhere as good. It's like who ever working on the development of thing steaming pile was slacking off. Perhaps sleeping. I will defiantly going back to the The Sims 3. Thank you EA for destroying another series. If that is what you are working at doing, then you are succeeding. I give up.;Very disappointed. Played around with it for a few hours ...
424;151.0;3.0;15.0;Its good game but unfortunately its just not there. The graphics and social aspects of the game are great (you don't just feel like your ordering your Sims to talk or do activities) but gameplay-wise, there are glaring holes in what you can do. The transitioning between different 'sections' of your neighborhood is tedious and it feels confining, lacking the real world flow of Sims 3. The housing design definitely is more refined but the character customization is almost cartoonish. I think overall it feels like they took Sims 1 and gave it a huge graphics kick. Its a fine game in its own right, but not a good sequel when compared to Sims 3 or even Sims 2.;Good but not Great
62;152.0;2.0;13.0;UPDATED: There are additional decor items such as rugs and paintings- a lot actually. Initially, I missed these because I had just played it briefly and was so turned off by some of the features that I didn't really explore it all. There is potential here and hopefully they will add the toddler stage back in an expansion pack and fix the camera.\n\nSeriously disappointed. It's as if they made improvements on things no one really cares about and took away the best aspects of the game. I was expecting an amped up Sims 3, instead I got something comparable to The Sims Freeplay. So disappointing! And no toddler stage??? What's going on here, EA? I've had the game for less than 12 hours, and I wish I could return it.;Please, please, fix this game
129;153.0;1.0;14.0;I have never been so disappointment in a new release game. Bugs are everywhere and they ripped so much stuff out of the game, that the Sims 1 has more to offer. EA Games are treating us like cash cows instead of valued customers.;Massive Disappointment
143;154.0;2.0;14.0;"I feel like I have to open with ""I love all things Sim..."" blah blah blah. But I'm guessing almost everyone who is looking at the game and reading the review loves The Sims, so I must open with ""I've owned all the games (TS1, TS2, TS3 and now TS4), including every expansion and many of the Prima Game Guides (because I'm that big a dork, yes ;) ) and this is by FAR the least favorite."" I admit I wasn't a huge fan of TS3 and ended up uninstalling them and reinstalling TS2, my all time Sim ""love""... But I looked forward to this new ""updated"" version and really enjoyed it-- but very briefly. (Read on or skim for in-depth descriptions... Sorry it's long and perhaps not super concise or clear. I overshare because these are the kinds of things I would want to know, myself).\n\nThe Sims 4 CAS was fun, picking the traits was entertaining, and playing with genetics was enjoyable. But then you start the game... My laptop (granted, nearly 4 years old) could not handle the game, despite the fact that it has almost nothing else installed (except maybe iTunes and Microsoft Suite), so when the graphics crashed and game blacked out, I tried to install it on my desktop-- only to be informed by Origin that ""the code has already been used"". I emailed Maxis customer service and as of today (8 days in), nothing-- not even a courtesy email saying ""we will get to you eventually, lifelong Sim fan..."". After some work and speaking to several employees, I was able to exchange the game at the store (where I purchased it) and install it on the desktop. Graphics worked, but the game was oh so disappointing. It has bits and pieces from previous versions: cribs and characters from S1, aging and careers from S2, somewhat open world, relationship bars and social options, etc. from S3... It also has other things that are new and ""cute"": emotions, new socials, huge pregnant bellies, ability to multitask, etc. The multitasking feature is useful -- if you don't mind your Sim chatting while building a skill like Computer Programming - which makes them work SLOOOOOWLY (and no, they won't gain the skill in the 5+ hours they had before work so they can get a promotion so they can afford that much-needed item for the home. Because they're busy chatting with the wife who should be skilling for her own job and the relative stranger they met at the park during a date many Sim days ago that somehow invited themselves into their house). The new socials and emotions are interesting to explore until you realize they are WAAAY too emotional. Bad joke? They are embarrassed for hours on end and sometimes get the ""hide from world"" want/ whim. Good joke? Now they're inspired and want other silly things that take a while to complete (""paint a confident painting"", ""tell someone about your dreams"", etc.). The points you get as reward are piddly; when you're used to 3,500 for Woohoo, 100 just doesn't seem like much -- and feels like more of a demotion than improvement. Finally, pregnancy. It was cute at first that the Sim could take a pregnancy test, or how the belly grew more naturally (vs the ""pop!"" in TS2), or share ""the big news"" with the dad and others... The labor starting and lasting for extended periods was okay as well, despite the fact that bladder, hunger and energy plummet like crazy. But then the Sim was in labor for days. Literally, DAYS. I reset the game, yet she was still laboring. Eating, sleeping, peeing, distracting the husband and kids (twins born the first time -- no issues and labor for some Sim hours, not days) and yes -- GOING TO WORK. If you're thinking I'm exaggerating-- I am not. She labored for 7 Sim days. SEVEN. I finally couldn't stand it anymore and gave up! (This was after a week of ""human time"", maybe 4 days/ evenings of game time, 2 days waiting if she will ever have that baby). And to add insult to injury, she also WORKED. Because there's NO MATERNITY leave. On day 7, she was about to pee herself and collapse simultaneously and was still heading to work, so I cancelled the action before she disappeared in front of the house... She came in and collapsed on the floor, only to be awakened by the ringing of her phone -- her boss calling her to tell her she is not impressed with the Eternally Pregnant Sim missing work and that her work performance would be lowered. Aaaaagh! (THAT is when I gave up and went online to write this review-- ridiculous!)\n\nOther small and large annoyances that immediately come to mind:\n1. There are no nannies or anything but a maid service and something else-- don't remember what. No nanny, nothing. When the Sims had the twins, I couldn't get the Sim to hire anyone or stay home... She skipped one day (yes, work performance took a nose dive) and was off for 2, then on day 4, she snuck off to work before I could stop her and as I sat anxiously awaiting the Social Worker, I saw a pop off that the kids were automatically sent to daycare. I looked in the cribs and sure enough-- they had vanished, not unlike the ""Left Behind"" movies. Spooky! They reappear when the first parent returns home - usually crying from hunger or a soiled diaper or boredom-- some daycare. Yikes.\n2. Things break. All. The. Time. Upgrades do nothing special. If it's a crappy toilet before the upgrade, it may ""flush well"" after, but it's still a crappy toilet that flushes well.\n3. Glitches are pretty common, in my short-lived experience. A jump bug caused the male Sim to jump out of the shower he was fixing for the upteenth time. Shower didn't have the ""fix"" option anymore, but the water still ran (deleting the shower and buying a new one didn't help). The worst bit? The wrench stuck in the Sim's hand for 3-4 Sim days (until I reset the game); he ate, slept, showered and went to work with it. It was silly looking.\n4. Pregnant Sims are SUPER hard to care for. Between the eating, peeing and sleeping (and working) she wasn't able to do anything: no new skills, friends, or hobbies. During the pregnancy, the romantic ""pink"" part of the relationship with her husband actually went down about 1/3 of the bar. (I'm never intentionally mean to my Sims -- I take care of them and their needs but this one peed herself nearly daily when she was pregnant... By the time I wake her up and click on the toilet, she does a little dance, waves her arms and walks awkwardly to the bathroom-- which is right next to the bedroom -- and pees on the floor, which empties her bladder, putting it in green, drains the hygiene completely and gives her an embarrassed moodlet for about 4 hours- even though no one saw her and I made her clean it up. The embarrassment is randomly accompanied by sighs and moans of embarrassment. After a while, I didn't care as much, but still-- annoying, right? ;))\n5. Weddings: my (exhausted) Sim proposed to her boyfriend and the option to ""plan the wedding"" popped up-- so I thought: ""why not?!"" But planning leads to a wedding. IMMEDIATELY. They were immediately transported to the site (park) for the wedding. The Sim hired a bartender but the park doesn't have a bar-- so not super useful. And the weirdest part?! No name change or option after the wedding. So the female Sim kept her maiden name and the groom kept his. I did some research but couldn't find any info on that. On the upside (if there is one here) is that babes born can have ANY first or last name. Both options are blank, so I added both parents names with a hyphen. Maybe it's a little something the creators forgot. Or maybe it's another glitch (the married name issue). Not sure.\n\nI could go on and on, but what's the point?! If you look at it like a new game of sorts, this may be fun for you (especially if Maxis fixes the glitches and adjusts motives a bit so Sims can do more than eat and sleep and work to survive). If you have extra cash laying around and are super curious to prove others wrong and know you'll love this game no matter what-- go for it! Personally, I've been a Simmer for over 10 years (sad but true fact -- and as the Sims and caffeine are my main vices in life, I refuse to apologize for my hobby! ;)) and I expect more. Much more. I bought the game on sale and had the Guide price matched to Amazon's price, but it was still a bit much, especially considering how little the game offers. So for now, the game went back (thankfully, I had the option to return it). I didn't ""hate it"" enough for 1 star. But didn't like it enough to keep playing it. And I certainly didn't have enough patience for more ""labor days"" of waiting to see if the Sim actually gives birth! For now, I'm going to reinstall TS2 and really take the time to appreciate and enjoy the game -- the fully functional, all expansions included, rather heavily modded version. Best of luck in your decision (hope this helps someone make a more informed decision! :))";Not worth the money or the time... Sadly.
211;155.0;1.0;14.0;I must say this game was a shock to me. The Sims 4 takes many steps back in terms of restrictions, load screens and the realism of life. There are no jobs to go to anymore your Sims just disappear of the screen a la Sims 1. As I played I found myself wanting to play the Sims 3 more and more instead. This is the first this happens to me playing the Sims.\n\nEA should pull this one off the market if it is looking to maintain any integrity when it comes to the Sims Franchise and the amount of money this game made them over the years.;It will just make you want to play the Sims 3 and act as if you bought it instead
224;156.0;1.0;14.0;So after ripping customers off with tons of Sims 3 DLC and expansions, the thieves at EA decide to wipe the slate clean and release a bare bones Sims 4, designed for the sole purpose of robbing customers again. EA is nothing but criminals, plus this game is terrible. Don't waste your hard earned dollars, don't feed the beast.;awful, don't waste your money
226;157.0;2.0;14.0;"The Sims 4, is without a doubt, disappointing. It didn't actually surprise me to be honest. After all, this was brought to you by the same geniuses at EA that were in charge the latest Simcity I believe, which flopped spectacularly. Well Sims 4 is not as bad as everyone says it is, it's without a doubt, a downgrade.\n\nI've played the Sims since I bought the Sims 1 Deluxe Edition back in 2003, when I was 8 years old, and I fell in love. What attracted me was that this was a life simulation game, something virtually unheard of at the time, and in the Sims 1, you can tell the designers tried to make it fairly realistic and fun, but due to technical limitations at the time, they couldn't make a completely realistic life simulator game. Then 2004 rolls around and the Sims 2 is released. Here, the Sims are in full 3-D this time and live in a bigger world, with actual places to go in their neighborhood and more realistic interactions between Sims. More items were added as well. In 2009, the Sims 3 comes out and it ditched loading screens in favor of an open world, one of the best improvements in the Sims series to date, making the Sims seem more life-like then ever before. That also opened up room for a LOT of new features to be added. I believe, the Sims 3 has had more features than any Sims game to date. But, once again, due to technical limitations at the time, the Sims 3 had a couple of things missing (like the inability to go into half of the community lot buildings). So now it's 2014, computers are faster than ever before, capable of running intense games, and since the Sims 3 series has grown rather dated, naturally it was time for a refresh.\n\nExcept this time, EA decided to take away a lot of features instead of adding features, including the the open world from the Sims 3, which in my opinion, was the best thing they ever added to the Sims. No doubt, the main reason they removed features is because they want to sell it in DLC, like they did with the Sims 3 after the Sims 2. Which would be fine, as this has happened before. Except way too many features were removed this time. So what was the big feature they added to this game, to make up for the missing features? Better social interactions.\n\nPros:\n\n-Better social interactions: Way more life-like now.\n-The new changes in build mode: The ability to place pre-created rooms is nice. Also, I like the ability to (finally) adjust your wall heights.\n-Multitasking: Your Sims could multitask before, but this game expands on that.\n-The way the actual Sims look: They don't exactly look life-like, but the Sims in this game look so much better than the ones in previous games.\n-The new Create-a-Sim mode: The fact that you can practically sculpt your Sim to look however you want is really cool.\n-Smartphones: The ability for your Sims to have smartphones is a plus, as they play a key part in this game.\n-Really fast: This game is blazing fast. Way faster than the Sims 3, and even 2. You can practically run this game on any computer.\n-Bug free: This game also noticeably isn't that glitchy. Wish I could say that about the Sims 3 when it was first released.\n-More careers: I like the new career modes that are available in this game.\n\nCons:\n\n-No more open world: You have to suffer through loading screens again (although they're at least fast).\n-No pools: Pools, a staple since the first Sims game, have been removed. Of course, you can still place fountains though. Because that just makes perfect sense (not).\n-No toddlers and baby mode is reduced: Toddlers have been eliminated from the game and the baby is once again confined to the carriage, like in the Sims 1.\n-Graphics: Some people like the new look, and I'll admit it looks okay, but next to the Sims 3, they're unrealistic and cheesy. In the Sims 3, they tried to make it look somewhat realistic without it requiring practically a super computer to run, as a result though, it ran slow on cheap computers. It's obvious they choose this new look so it would run on very cheap laptops and tablets that ""normal"" people love to get.\n-Color customization mode is gone: You can't customize the colors of anything anymore, rather you're back to choosing preset colors again.\n-Small neighborhoods: The neighborhood's size is reduced to the size of the neighborhood in the Sims 1. And they didn't even make it so you can see the whole thing at once, rather you have to hover your cursor over sections of the neighborhood to see it.\n-No cars: You're Sims literally just take out their smartphones and poof everywhere. They didn't even do this in the Sims 1.\n-The new user interface: After playing the Sims 1, 2 and 3, which had virtually identical interfaces, they decided to redo the Sims 4 interface and it requires more moving of the mouse and it is less intuitive. I'm used to it now but I still think the new interface is worse in every way.\n-New limit to number of stories you can build in an house: 3\n\nAfter playing this game for a few hours, it's safe to say this game needed at least another year of development or so. It was definitely rushed, and at the end of the day, it feels like I'm playing a dumbed down version of the Sims that feels more like an iPhone game. Seriously, the Sims 3 mobile version almost has more features than this game.\n\nMy recommendation, buy it from Origin, play it for a couple of hours, and it you like the game, great! If you don't, you can get a full refund within the first 24 hours of purchase";Feels like a Weird Hybrid Mix of the Sims 1, 2, and 3 with Most Worthwhile Features Removed
244;158.0;1.0;14.0;After hearing horror stories all I can say is I don't see why people still buy EA's crap instead of going to indie games or finding another hobby altogether. Thanks to all the crash test dummies dumb enough to buy this after the SimCity 2013 disaster (which I didn't buy until just a few months ago after the online req was removed though it still sux due to the tiny map sizes). I'm sure the game will get a lot better when you wait 6 months then buy $100 in expansion packs. Morons. For me I'll probably never buy it or the packs. Currently playing Civilization 5 then maybe Witcher 2 (again) after. If it says EA on it I'm avoiding it.;Fools and their money are soon parted.
245;159.0;4.0;14.0;"Despite all the negative reviews, I decided it was worth trying this game out especially with the 24 hr guarantee at Origin.  I'm going to review my positives first, and then my cons.\n\n1. I can see what EA is trying to do with the loading screens.  It's setting up the world FOR YOU so that when you arrive, it's not an empty building, people are already conversing or doing something.  That, it itself, is amazing.  The sims you aren't controlling are actually doing something.  My favorite trip was to the local bar and witnessing fast service at the bar, no stack ups, and watching a group of sims interact together, laughing.  It was crazy surreal, something I definitely haven't seen before.\n\n2. Multi-tasking, when available, is great.  Shaving off some time by socializing while cooking is great.  It would be better if like while walking home, your sim can text or chat a sim up on the phone\n\n3. I love the emotions.  The best moment for me was when my sim was walking home from the bar.  She was tired, but happy, so she had this sloppy walk with a grin on her face; she legit looked like she was coming home drunk.  I find it's a little too easy to keep the Sims happy, so I haven't seen angry or anything like that in my evening of play.\n\n4. I didn't expect it, but I absolutely LOVE how if you take one Sim out on the town, the sims left at home can fend for themselves.  I never realized how aggravating it was to keep switching, making sure that Sim is doing something.  You can just focus on the one Sim and that's just fine for me.\n\n5. As others have said, the graphics are great and I like how we're coming back around to Sims 2 style.  My personal favorite.\n\n6. I'm just going to throw this out there: I hated the toddler stage.  I hated teaching them to walk, talk, and go to the bathroom.  Because that was all there was to DO with them.  If the toddler stage does come back, I pray that there will be more to it.\n\n7. It's fast.  No more lagging, Sims don't stall out, everything loads beautifully.  I will gladly welcome a 15 sec load screen to avoid stuttering and this happens even with a great video card in my computer.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Why can't I tilt my camera?  Sometimes the camera angle is wrong, so I have to zoom in a lot to get away from the God-Like Perspective.  Maybe I'm missing something?\n\n2. Please, for all that is holy, why must I wait for an expansion for my Sim to let me know who s/he is attracted to?  Don't make me bone everyone in the room, man.  Because I will.\n\n3. My heart is broken that I don't have a family tree and/or relationship status.  I've heard that you can flirt with family members without that.  Though I will see if/when it happens.\n\n4. OMG, my furniture doesn't match!! No seriously, this is driving me crazy and one of the best things about Sims 3.  BRING IT BACK.\n\n5. More community lots are a must.  I don't think four is enough to keep anyone's attention for long.\n\nAll in all, I won't be returning the game because I generally had fun.  There will probably be an expansion pack in January or February that will have new features, or bring some back.  Either way, I always recommend testing the game out.  Don't like it? Return it and keep enjoying Sims 2 or 3.  Those are still great games and I'll load them up from time to time.  But I'm enjoying EA's direction and waiting for more.";A not negative review, though there are a few negatives.
246;160.0;1.0;14.0;Sims 4 has been highly disappointing to me. I am one of those individuals who has been playing since the first game, and I even ran a site dedicated to Sims 2 before it was even released. I think enough is said just simply comparing the reviews of Sims 3 vs Sims 4 at this point. You'll get more for your money from the 3rd base game before you'll get anything close with Sims 4 through expansions, and we all know a million of those are on the way. EA has been losing respect at an amazing pace over the years. The only thing they have working to their (or our) benefit is their return policy, which I used for Sims 4 while I still could.;A lot of hype and not much else
249;161.0;1.0;14.0;I've been playing the sims ever since I was 10 years old on a junky old windows computer. As a longterm customer I found this game to be an extremely disappointing waste of money. It is not at all worth the price and doesn't have the magic of the old games. Don't buy it...;As a longterm customer I found this game to be an extremely disappointing waste of money
268;162.0;1.0;14.0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT DOES NOT WORTH THE 70 or 80 bucks.\nTHis game is incomplete!! and EA stripped so many features that it is just sad.\n\nthe new world map is just a complete disappointment!;DO NOT BUY!!
280;163.0;4.0;14.0;I wanted to take a few days and play the game and get a sense of it before I reviewed it.  I've played the Sims since the first entry in the franchise.  I actually was on a Maxis mailing list for a full year prior to the release of that first game, and the anticipation was pretty hysterical then.  Fast forward fourteen years, and the games have expanded so much, it's pretty incredible.  But something that hasn't really evolved much is actual gameplay.  It seems like with the Sims 2 and Sims 3 the heightened emphasis was on adding content that allowed people to interact creatively with the game world, whether it be customizing Sim clothing or hairstyles, adding mods, floors/wallpapers, building lots to share...People grew accustomed to a dimension of gameplay where you'd spend hours creating a Sim, or building a mansion and selecting just the right texture for your couch, and then when it came time to play the actual game, they would just speed through the animations!  Earn money!  Earn promotions!  Stack interactions!  Stack commands!  I can't speak for anyone else, and I don't claim to, but I found actual gameplay to be boring with the Sims 3.  The addition of the Island Paradise expansion pack did revitalize gameplay for me because it was a fresh new expansion pack and not a reboot from the previous games, but I soon grew bored of that.  In all honesty, I'd be bored waiting the seven minutes it took my game to load into a world.  We live in a day and age where it now takes seconds to load an operating system, and it took me seven minutes to load a game?  And then have to rely on mods and hacks to avoid freezing and crashing?  Very frustrating.  But now I think that Maxis/EA have actually attempted to expand gameplay so that players aren't driven to just speed their way through one easy objective after another.  I think the Sims 4 is putting gameplay front and center and for the people who have grown to love content above all else in these games, they feel upset and betrayed and they want to send a message to EA that they are unhappy, which is understandable.  I'm not going to try to undermine these people's very genuine cause for upset.  What I will say is that I don't agree with voting reviews as unhelpful when people do find positive things to say about the Sims 4 because it is possible to play this game and enjoy it.  It is possible for the reviews that express enjoyment to be as legitimate as those who find fault.\nThe game looks good, and it feels more immersive than other Sims games to me.  The lighting provides nice atmosphere, and there are some cool new building features like walls of different heights, curved fences, the ability to move rooms and whole buildings, the ability to add foundation of different heights AT ANY POINT during building.  And the Sims themselves are lively and social.  You get way more Sims showing up on community lots and way more opportunities for interaction with the new ability to multi-task.  This is the kind of gameplay that I had hoped Sims 3 would bring, and didn't.  The days of skilling and then running to fulfill needs afterwards are over because now your Sim can do up to three things at once.  So there are positives...\nAs far as negatives are concerned...I love the IDEA of the open world, but I don't think it was ever executed properly in the Sims 3.  I would love to have an open world like Skyrim where my Sims could run around and do whatever they wanted, but so much about Skyrim is scripted, and I don't want a scripted Sims experience with characters just saying the same lines over and over.  Obviously an interactive open world is a massive undertaking.  Until Maxis/EA figure out a way to do it right in the Sims universe, I'll live with load screens that only last a few seconds.  Yes, it would be nice to walk to the house next door without one, but I'm not a programmer, and I don't understand all that goes into trying to develop a game that will run well on a variety of different machines.  The team obviously felt that this was the most elegant solution, at least initially for dealing with some of the complaints and headaches they've had to field about the Sims 3 for the last five years.\nThe thing that really annoys me is that I played a Sim, and got her a boyfriend, got the boyfriend to move in and renovated her house.  I saved more than once.  I quit the game.  I returned to the game later and the saved game was GONE!  It loaded my Sim's house pre-boyfriend and pre- move-in.  Everything I had done after that point was gone, and I had made a point of saving more than once!  So...yeah, there are bugs.  It's to be expected.  It's also to be expected that those bugs will be ironed out.  And that missing content will be added.  There's nothing for EA to gain from pissing off the fans of their games.  I honestly don't think it was their aim to do that, or that they just didn't care.\nI still can see the potential for the game to expand and satisfy a lot of the concerns that content enthusiasts have now.  But the focus for this base game was the development of a new approach to gameplay, which I appreciate, and others appreciate as well.  I think that's every bit as legitimate as the frustration being expressed over the lack of content.\nThanks for taking the time to read this.;Yes, it is possible to have fun playing the Sims 4, even with the bugs that need to be ironed out.
313;164.0;2.0;14.0;I'll start with this. The game loads super fast and runs very well, I also like the interactions between the sims. The ability for them to multitask is VERY nice. BUT this game doesn't seem like the next step up, it feels like an updated version of Sims 2.\nI'll just do a few of my biggest pet peeves.\nThe closed world is driving me crazy and the world is small. I like building, but so far I am not caring for this, maybe I just need to get use to it.  Then lack of family trees, that was one of my favorite features about Sims 3. Then no CAS! REALLY!?!\nThere are many more things I don't like, but these are the worst offenses. I can't believe they dropped so many things that were the big selling point of sims 3. I see myself playing with 3 way more than 4.;An updated version of Sims 2
325;165.0;1.0;14.0;Disappointed by the sheer lack of things in sims that should be standard. A life sim should at least be able to get the stages of life all humans go through. Even from a distance it's obvious that features are being cut for future DLCs. Enough is enough. Vote with your wallet and do NOT buy this game.;Cut content and small worlds
395;166.0;2.0;14.0;"No open world I am truly devastated. Why are we back to this? We loved The Sims 3 ;( EA should really make an update that makes the game at least up to The Sims 3 standards don't us simmers at least deserve that? :(";:(
401;167.0;5.0;14.0;People need to stop thinking this is a Sims 3 sequel or something, just like TS2 was a follow-up to TS1, and TS3 was a follow-up to TS2. TS4 is not a follow-up to TS3. It is really a whole different game. No one can get over that fact. Everyone went in with the wrong expectations, and they feel hurt. But you know what, it is their fault and they can't be mad. The indications were there long ago. I spent 5 hours on the game last night after I got home from work, and I enjoyed every hour of it. But you know what? I went into the game thinking I would hate it but had good expectations for it, not the other way around. The core focus of the game kind of got lost somewhere between TS1 and TS3 until we ended up with TS3 which was a house-building game with a social simulator included. With TS4, they went back to what the game was always supposed to be, what it was always supposed to focus on: social interaction. TS3 is still a fantastic game for house-building, and it'll always be in my library, but TS4 for me will always be a fantastic game focusing on socialization. The system they developed is very unique and detailed to say the least, and the day-today life in TS4 is unrealistic like all of TS games, but does not lack the novelty of the franchise. Yes, there are ares where TS4 is lacking, and it is going to be. The core focus was shifted, and it is a base-game. Of course it will be different compared to TS3 base-game at release. Maxis wasn't trying to reboot the franchise or continue with something that became a perversion of Will Wright's original idea. To me it seems they were trying to give his dream new life, and I think they did it quite fantastically. I do not know what caused it, but one of the consequences of an unknown(to me) was the sacrifice in visual realism. TS3 was a beautiful game with beautiful visuals, but TS4 is too cartoony for too many people(mainly because the had hoped for an updated version of TS3). The focus on a life simulator is still there, and it is incredible. Just don't talk to Don Lothario. He'll harass you.;"It is The Sims 4, NOT The ""New"" Sims 3"
422;168.0;4.0;14.0;I'm only giving this game four stars due to the missing toddler life stage. Other than that, I can not express my gratitude to EA for releasing a new game that runs perfectly on my older computer. I bought a high end pc back in 2009 ( which now is pretty ancient in computer years) and this games runs so fluidly, much better than sims 3 ever played on my machine. They are smart to release a new game where majority of the population doesn't need to run out and buy a new computer. I don't think this game deserves the negative feedback it's been getting. The neighborhoods are small and no swimming pools, but that will all be addressed in expansions and updates I'm sure. Great clothes and hairstyles for once!!!;Been a fan since sims 1
42;169.0;5.0;11.0;I feel like the reviews here for The Sims 4 are incredibly misleading. I definitely would not average this game as a 3 star. Sure, they have gotten rid some important things people liked most about The Sims 3, mainly being the CAS (create a style). I honestly never really used that feature much in 3 and I certainly don't miss it in 4. Everything I hated about 3 is not present in The Sims 4, mainly being that the load time and game play is phenomenally better! I can build a mansion and my screen doesn't freeze every 5 seconds or have the characters make jerky motions because it is trying to load the screen. The best thing about The Sims 4 I feel is definitely the graphics, which I don't understand why so many are complaining about. The household items seem bigger and boxier, but I like the way that looks. I love that there is not so much unused space now! The hair is on point and I love the extra detail they put into creating a Sim and adjusting their body. You can have any kind of body shape you want, and it is so much fun to play with that!\n\nIn buy/build mode, there is a new feature called 'styled rooms' and these are pre-made and decorated rooms that you can plop down on your lot if you're building fresh and not have to spend a ton of time decorating. Most of the fun for me in The Sims is actually building a house, but sometimes I get so excited about a Sim I just made and it's nice to just have the option to put down a styled room and be done with it. There are many styled options for this as well.\n\nThe absolute best and totally new feature in gameplay is having The Sims be able to MULTITASK! How amazing! You can cook a meal, sit down at the couch to eat it and watch tv at the same time! So your Sims can fulfill both the fun and hunger needs, ultimately killing two birds with one stone and not wasting so much game time being forced to do one or the other. Your Sim is a bookworm and constantly wants to read, but they have to use the bathroom? Not a problem in The Sims 4, now they just take the book to the toilet, reading and peeing at the same time. This is a wonderful feature and the biggest selling point of the whole game. Everything is so much more exciting now, and you can have group chats as well, not just focusing on one person.\n\nHowever, this game does unfortunately have a couple of drawbacks. The most important one (for me) being that there are not many variations of 'whims' (conversation type bubbles over your Sims head that shows what they desire to do). I have played with about four different families so far, and I keep getting the same ones. I would like more things to do in that aspect and I hope that they come more frequent with game packs and expansions. Another (fairly minor) drawback is not having a more expansive world, there are no restaurants to go in the base game. Just a bar/lounge, museum, library, and gym. I would like to see a cafe/diner, fancy restaurant, movie theater, and supermarket. Hopefully these will come with updates, expansion or game packs.\n\nI think The Sims 4 is better now with all the recent updates than it may have been when it was first released, so please don't let the horrible reviews deter you from playing this game! I promise once you start, you will become addicted! The multi-tasking game play makes for an exciting time.;A great game, poor reviews are very misleading!
20;170.0;2.0;9.0;I'm late to the sims 4 party but I bought this when it was on sale recently. I've always loved the sims and especially loved the building features of sims 3 (and the sims play features of sims 2). Honestly, I spend 90% of the time making houses and I'm not really into the people aspect.\n\nThen I bought the sims 4 and suddenly HATE creating the houses. They really destroyed that part of the game and took away all of the customizable features. Everything they include is just ugly and doesn't make any sense. It all looks very amateur.\n\nThe gameplay is okay but it seems very difficult to make money. I also can't believe there's only like 6 empty lots to choose from on a map. I'm used to designing a whole neighborhood. Although, I don't want to do that with their awful building tools and objects anyway.\n\nMayen the expansion packs would help give this game some life....but probably not.;If you loved building the houses, you will not enjoy this version.
157;171.0;1.0;13.0;"Ok listen, I am a huge simmer, I've been playing it for a very long time. So obviously I was excited for the Sims 4. Basically create a sims is what they push because the rest is absolutely terrible. Create a sim is truly great and a new innovation in the sims world, but gameplay is a giant ""f*ck you"" to sim players. Loading screens for everything, no pools or basements or dishwashers, almost nothing to do during the game, the whole thing is an absolute wreck. It's the most bland base game ever and I'm not sure if I'm willing to buy expansion packs after wasting $70 on the base game for it to dissapoint me so badly.\n\nBasically this sits on my bookshelf of shame where I put video games I really regret purchasing.

173;172.0;1.0;13.0;Incredibly boring compared to the last games. The last ones I played and caught on and played for weeks on end. This one was a struggle for me to like- I tried, I really did- but haven't played it more than 5 times since I bought it. I would have returned it if I hadn't gone through Game Stop online purchase. Not worth it.\n\nUPDATE 12/18/14: The game still sucks. I haven't changed my opinion on it.;boring compared to the others
181;173.0;1.0;13.0;Too bad there's no way to give NO stars, it's that bad, folks. From the horrible pixel mess of the screens, the ghost town images of the 'world', to the small, small size of that world, the game rots. No seamless world either. Prepare to load a screen a minute. Emotions? Can hardly tell, and who cares. No cars, no pools, no toddlers, no school buses or schools, no workplaces--the ORIGINAL Sims was better than this piece of garbage. Personally, I think this was either an accident, ie, some geek put the first run of this thing in the 'finished' box or a relative of the owner of EA got hired by the company and mucked it up.;Too bad there's no way to give NO stars
182;174.0;1.0;13.0;No, just no. I feel like EA has taken great shortcuts and removed so many features with the Sims 4. The Sims 3 was great and I would be ashamed to know how many hours I spent playing the Sims 3. Yeah, there are some cool new things about the Sims 4, but they have REMOVED over 89 features. Really EA, really? How stupid do you think your customers are? The world is extremely small, there is a loading screen between EVERY lot, even your neighbors lot. The biggest killer for me, NO STORY PROGRESSION. All people do is get older. No one gets married, has children, or ANYTHING unless you MAKE THEM. What kind of Sim game is that? In real life you don't walk over to your neighbors house and say, hey, it's time you get married and have children now. So all Sims are simple robots who only eat, sleep, and die. I could go on and on, but I'll put in as much effort into this review as EA did into their $70 game. Besides, finding information on how bad The Sims 4 is isn't hard, it's widely known in the gaming community. No, I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone. Don't waste your money, or at least return the game and spend your money elsewhere if you do, and wait to see if the Sims 5 is any better.;No, just no.
183;175.0;1.0;13.0;I am back to playing the first Sims game from years ago. This is pathetic and tragic I will be bored within 2 days. There is so much missing and the game is unbelievably boring.

Missing? all terra forming,no pool,children suddenly 10 years old,no interesting jobs,no shopping,no town,fencing almost works,building almost works,boring clothes remember when we could make our own?nothing new nothing to do parents go to work and leave the baby home alone. The controls are awkward and undoing the mess expensive but there are heaps of money cheats. This gets a huge thumbs down. Not worth the  money or the time. Embarrassing for ea every other game producer has well outstripped you. From pets,night life,a generational family to this? It really sucks.;This is pathetic and tragic I will be bored within 2 days
239;176.0;5.0;13.0;I don't think people are keeping in mind that this is a base game and that's why they are rating it so low. The graphics are so cool and CAS is phenomenal! It is so responsive and the detail is incredible. I also love emotions. It changes so many aspects of the game and how you can interact with your Sims! The one drawback I found that does not have to do with missing content (which should be remedied with expansion packs) is the camera. The bar at the bottom makes it difficult to scroll down without delicating lining up your cursor above the bar. It's frustrating, but I think they are fixing it. All in all, I think it is a great base game and I cannot wait for the expansion packs!;Great Base Game
278;177.0;4.0;13.0;I've been a Sims addict since 2000 I had all the expansion packs and most of the stuff packs, for TS2 and TS3 as well. With all the complaints and the laundry list of things missing from TS4 I really thought it was going to be a dud, like thanks EA wth. But I gave it a shot and purchased it through Origin (with all of that missing stuff they were not getting me to buy the version with the extras for some animal hats and stuff, no sir). I was pleasantly surprised to say I genuinely LOVE TS4.  I wasn't a fan of the cartoony look at first but CAS is pretty awesome. The sims are like clay and you just pull and push till you like the result.  Although I would have liked an option to combine some of the preset body part shapes like we had before with the slider system.  It's still really fun to make a sim in TS4.  I love that the sims are smarter, I wasn't sure how that would translate in terms of game play but omg they actually flush the toilet and wash their hands on their own instead of being little digital balls of nasty and running out of the house without washing off the germs. It's not like I need to explain all that to them! They make their beds on their own too! They get up and go eat something when they want it. Albeit not very healthy choices. For example one of my kids, if left to his own devices, will always go for chips instead of an actual meal his father the chef, prepared. But kids will be kids I guess:) They ACTUALLY MULTI-TASK and keeping up relationships is not nearly as time consuming because of it. They chat while watching TV or over a meal or whatever. Hell even while making out, but I think that just might mean have a tv addict or something in the house. Sometimes I just sit and watch what they do.  Overall they just have WAY MORE PERSONALITY than ever and it shows.  I am way more into house building and altering than I was for TS3. Let me be clear here, I HATED THE BUILD MODE IN TS3. Just placing a darn grid size became a nightmare because I could never get it to line up properly with the street.  Roofs too, just didn't have the patience for that with TS3 like it way better in TS4.  But ever since TS2 I am a relatively casual builder so to each their own. If you want to build a house that looks good, is functional and just get back to playing, then this game is for you.\n\nSo after 32 hours of gameplay. I would say:\n\nPROS:\nSmarter sims. - Have I said multi-tasking? Way more interaction options and I haven't had a single routing issue so far. Once, I had one sim walk through another but same thing happens when I play FFXIV so really couldn't care less. At least it wasn't 10 seconds of toe tapping rinse and repeat.\n\nMore job item rewards - I've gotten a fancy digital desk, a coffee maker, 3 high end countertops and an awesome villain chair in just a few days. Saved me some money while I was trying to figure out how the job system works.\n\nRepair items system - I love that they get parts to upgrade and repair items. That makes it slightly more fun to deal with when your toilet backs up 5 min before work.\n\nSmooth gameplay -  It's butter smooth no lag or anything.  Just to be fair, this is the base game and there is very little available to add to the game to slow it down and there isn't too much in the way of  custom content available yet.  TS2 base game and TS3 base game loaded a lot more quickly too.  I had so much custom content in the other two games that it took 7+ minutes to load TS3.  Lots of time to kill there.\nAnd how many games, programs, or OSs for that matter aren't at least a little glitchy when first released? As far as I'm concerned all early adopters are paying beta testers for any tech company. So I volunteered as a guinea pig and am taking the good with the bad (if some bad shows up, knock on wood).  If you want to wait till they get the kinks out by all means do so, I did so forcibly with TS3 cause I didn't have a powerful enough PC to run it.  Again knock on wood, this is the least glitchy Sims game I have had so far. The worst thing that has happened for me in TS4 is that my sims sometimes keep their skill bar over their heads for a while longer than they should, but it goes away on it's own.  When I first got TS2 I had a family of 5 (2 parents and 3 kids) one day the parents just didn't come home like they died or something off screen and when I quit the lot and restarted without saving the kids showed up as miserable orphans in the thumbnail and then the lot just failed. I had to delete it and start over. That was a spectacular and memorable glitch for me but I sure kept playing. So I'm not surprised about creepy baby glitches (happened with every version of Pets too, every once and a while a disturbing exploded looking cat or dog would happen).  And there weren't cars that your sim could drive in any basegame. Although the TS3 bikes were nice.\n\nCONS:\nThe open world was awesome in TS3 - this game doesn't have that but if that means less glitches and routing issues down the road I think I can learn to live with it.\n\nI do miss basements - Really didn't care about pools I thought they were boring except when drowning Sims in TS1.\n\nI want toddlers back - and I don't like the baby in the bassinet deal from TS1. TS2 babies were my fav. TS3 bundle babies were not my thing either.\n\nMore lots per town would be good too - Right now not bothering me too much because it's really easy for your active family to meet other sims on any community lot or anyone just jogging past your house.\n\nWAS A CON... then I figured it out. The camera system was really annoying at first. The only time I liked it was when I was rotating an object in build mode. But you can toggle between the TS4 camera and TS3 camera if you like. I leave it on the TS3 camera for live mode and most of the time in build mode but I'm really glad they gave you the choice.\n\nSUMMARY...in-case TLDR:\nDespite the list of complaints you can read online it's a good base game. Yeah there are some things I would like back, but as a reboot of the game I love having smarter sims and the cartoony look goes with all their silly expressions, of which they have a lot. The lots are nice, the graphics are nice, and the build mode is waaayyy more user friendly. People largely don't seem to like drastic change, myself included. So when you see a huge list of missing items, it really makes you want to think twice about sticking with any brand or series, but this game was a pleasant surprise and I don't have a single regret about getting it. They're lively little digital critters and I like seeing what they'll do next. This is all just my opinion do whatever you think is best but I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater cause TS4 isn't all bad.  I'll keep playing it and I'm looking forward to the expansion packs.;I personally LOVE IT. May not be everyone's cup of tea but it's not nearly as awful as you may have read
292;178.0;1.0;13.0;"A ""stripped down"" excuse of a game. You know you're doing the sequel wrong when you take away many things the previous game did right, such as the open world and myriad of customization options in The Sims 3 base game. The amount of features removed is appalling. We'll see simple things that were previously in Sims games, as DLC or Sims store content (for an extra cost).";"A ""stripped down"" excuse of a game. You know ..."
309;179.0;4.0;13.0;"I think last time I reviewed a Sims game it was for the launch of TS2 base game. I did purchase TS3 but didn't write a review but wanted to share my experience with TS4 base game. There will be minimal comparisons to prior games as I try not to view each Sims game as a sequel, but as a standalone product that is then built upon. I purchased the game through Origin and have played for about 15 hours.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- The game runs as smooth as silk. The loading time for the game itself and going between zones is very short. The optimization in this game is great and I'm happy for that. If you are into buying laptops off a shelf at your local Best Buy, this game will likely not run well. I have a custom rig and I am overjoyed to finally have a sims game that doesn't make my PC look like a chump. TS3 was not very well optimized so no matter how good your PC was, the game still ran a bit like a clunker. Finally, my gaming rig is being used to it's potential in a sims game.\n\n- The art style is very Pixar. If you like that, then you'll enjoy the way this game looks. There is a very CGI film look to the sims. Personally, I like it. While I can appreciate realism, I already have real life so the fantasy look works well for me. At times it even reminds me of Fable.\n\n- Build mode is so easy now and is much more forgiving. Just push and pull to adjust rooms, roofs, stairs, walls. You now have the ability to move an entire room from one place to another. You can even move the whole house if you wanted to. In prior games, you'd have to delete the whole thing and start over, or move the house to another lot altogether. You can adjust foundation heights, and wall heights. Windows can be adjusted at different heights on the walls.\n\n- CAS has vastly improved. If you can visualize a sim, you can create a very close likeness in the new CAS. You can pull and push various portions of the body to mold them into whatever you want. A sim of a specific ethnicity is easier to create than in prior iterations. An Asian sim looks like an Asian sim. Diversity has been greatly expanded on.\n\n- Discoverables. There are quite a few things for your sims to find out in the world which so far has encouraged me to switch up my typical ""stay home and skill up to get that promotion to make that money"" play style. There are treasure maps your sims can find by digging, which you can then use to find treasure out in the world. In addition to fishing and gardening there are these frog holes about that your sims can use to search for frogs. They can be taken home and then bred in an aquarium. Your sims can also find gems that have auras to affect your sims' emotional state. There are also aliens to find, but I haven't found any just yet.\n\n- The sims themselves and the emotions. It is quite hard to describe this but the seems feel so much more alive as opposed to robots awaiting a command from us, the players. The Dev team seems to have worked hard on the animations of each sim, right down to the facial expressions. When two sims are in love, you can see it in their face. When your sim is angry you'll see it in the way they way and they will slam the refrigerator door and grumble to themselves. If they're embarrassed, they'll go hide under the covers. There are just so many little details in the way they behave that just makes it so fun to watch them. The sims are also more likely to interact with another sim as opposed to an object on the lot. This was a big deal for me. I noticed in TS3 that sims would all bee line for the object in the room with the highest fun rating. In TS4, they want to talk to each other and interact.\n\n- Multitasking. Sims can multitask now and thank goodness. In my game my sim chatted with her husband while she was making breakfast. When she sat down to eat, in the dining room she was able to watch TV in the attached living room, eat and chat with her husband thus filling fun, social and hunger in one sitting. Thank you Maxis/EA for this! Due to the multitasking ability, your sims no longer need a good 3 hours to prep to go to work with multiple bars filled. Speaking of going to work:\n\n- When your sim goes to work, they can now leave right at the time their work day starts. No more carpool one hour ahead which gives them far more time to get things done at home. However, now that they can multitask, they will be ready for work very quickly. Many of the traditional careers such as politics, business, medical are not in the base game, however a few new ones have been added such as Tech Guru and Secret Agent. There are 8 careers to choose from with 2 paths in each.\n\n- Improved pathing and routing but it does lead to some clipping. In prior iterations sims would easily get stuck in places. At worst they would collide and stand there for however long just tapping their foot while the game decided on the routing. This is now absent in TS4 but it leads to some clipping when in tighter areas. Instead of sims getting stuck, the collision is removed and they will pass through things. Personally, this doesn't bother me because I was very annoyed with the foot tapping and waiting but I can recognize some people will have a fit about it.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Lack of terrain tools. This means all lots are flat. Someone who is a very skilled builder will feel limited by this.\n\n- No more carpool. When your sim goes to work, they walk to the edge of the lot and fade out. While this is by no means a major drawback for me, it would have been nice to see them get into a car that then drove off and faded.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n- If the sims is the only game you play, I almost pity you because there are so many other wonderful game experiences to be had that you are missing out on. It leads to a certain amount of unnecessary disappointment. I play a large variety of games (shooters, RPGs, action) and the sims is a game I come back to between those. As a result, I am never really bored with the series. However, you will also likely be disappointed because it is a base game and there is not tons to do as in the full EP experience in TS3, which leads to the below.\n\n- If you are coming into this with the expectation it will measure up with TS3 and ALL of it's EPs, you're doing it wrong. There's just no comparison. You can't compare a full pina colada with a can of pineapples that has yet to be opened and combined with other items to make the full drink. You will be sorely disappointed but rightfully so because the bar was never set at a realistic level.\n\n- This game will not run well on older machines, and many that are pre-fab. If you're a real gamer, you have a real machine and you'll have no issues. Many of the reports of crashing, deformed babies etc are due to the end user trying to run the game on a calculator with an integrated chipset. This is a good time to upgrade to a real machine.\n\nThe Indifferent:\n\n- There's been a big to do about pools and toddlers being included in this base game. My play style never did revolve around a pool or a toddler so frankly they are not missed. There were way too many other objects in the game for my sims to interact with to make either of those things critical ""must haves"". If you were a person that used a pool as a decorative item, you're in luck because there is a fountain tool built into TS4 that looks very much like a pool but cannot be utilized as one.\n\n- No more open world. My sims were either at home, at work, or at a community lot. I don't think I ever had them randomly roam around the world like it was Skyrim or something. There were no caves or dungeons to discover and loot, so it just wasn't something my sims ever did. I don't mind that it is gone because they have added in public spaces around residential and community lots to be explored. The difference is that in TS4 there are actually things to find.\n\n- Lack of CASt. I'm pretty 50/50 on CASt being gone. I don't care too heavily because I see how it adversely affected the performance of TS3, however I also recognize that the game wasn't that well optimized. So far, I have not missed it terribly but I have done limited decorating in my game so far. I moved my family into a pre-fab house and changed a few things but not too many. For someone whose entire sim experience was spent on building and decorating this will be a very hard thing to take. However,the game is a life simulation and not an interior decorating trainer. There are a fair amount of recolors available for objects and clothing, and of course there is ability to make your own recolors for things as well.\n\n- Move objects on cheat is gone. However, the devs did improve the placement of objects so the cheat is a lot less essential this time around. For example you can put columns on walls now without the cheat. However, I'm sure there is that ONE thing that you'll want to do that you can't do that will probably make you want to rage quit, but me less so since I hardly ever used it. I'm fine with it being out now as it may likely make a return later on.\n\nThere will be a number of negative reviews out there for this game based on ""missing content"". I encourage you to read through them and then go back and read through a few of the negative reviews for TS2 and TS3. Exact same complaints, different iteration of game, but yet the final review scores for those game ended up being high. Go figure.\n\nThis is a base game. If you have played any of the others sims games, you know what a base game is. It is the foundation on which all of the EPs will expand on. In my opinion, TS4 is a very solid foundation. The game itself is hard to describe in words and doesn't show well in the Let's Plays or live streams. You have to experience it yourself. EA does have a great game guarantee that you can take advantage of. You are the best judge of if this game is the right fit for you, so try it for yourself.";TS4 Basegame - Solid Foundation for the Series

Now after all these months I'd like to change and update my review.\n\nBased on a love of the Sims and playing the franchise for many years I have to give this version a low to mediocre review.\n\nThe thing that drew me to The Sims in the first place was sandbox play and the creativity that allowed me to build my neighborhoods as I liked.  This has been replaced by themed neighborhoods and scripted, linear play.\n\nIf you like to grind away at careers and skills....this might be the game for you. If you are less goal oriented and like to make your own fun.....run, run away.\n\nThe latest problem is the culling that goes on in game. Sims are being culled without regard to interaction with other Sims.  Develop a friendship at work with a town Sim?  Tomorrow they might be gone. Building a family tree?  Ancestors, and their ghosts, will be removed leaving you with an empty, broken family tree.  The developers say this feature of the game is working as it should.\n\nThe developers are not communicating with the players to let anyone know when the numerous bugs and glitches are going to be fixed.

I was hoping for a game with a compromise between Sims 2 & 3 (the ability to make custom animations, realistically modded characters, and etc. of Sims 2 combined with the open world and item customization of Sims 3).  Instead, here is this total POS. If I could give this negative stars, I would max them out as much as possible into the farthest negative galaxy. The characters look like unrealistic crap and the world they live in is even worse, with loading screens between each small patch of hyper-cartoony green ""grass"" land. It isn't a pretty game. It isn't a fun game. Even Sims 1 blows this away excessively so in regards to entertainment. EA should be delighted if anyone would so much as keep a completely free copy on their hard drive. I have bought every Sims game and expansion ever made and I have liked or loved all of them, but this .... this is a joke. Also, EA is greedy.";Total piece of $%#@
116;184.0;1.0;12.0;I've been a Sims fan since the Sims 1.  Each installment has had its issues, but for the most part, it improved on the previous game.  The Sims 4 is an exception.  I won't even go into what they didn't include in the game originally or the high price tag because that's been mentioned in plenty of reviews and I agree with them.\n\nCreation - 1/10\nThe create-a-sim was more intuitive but no matter what I did, my sim looked the same.  The color options were limited and the look just didn't impress me.  Very limited amount of choices for makeup looks, accessories and shoes.  The only improvement was some of the hairstyles they included (as this is usually an area where the game falls short - I usually download a lot of custom hairs).\nBuild mode is somewhat easier, but again, the limited colors/choices/options make it seem very uninspired.\n\nGameplay - 3/10\nThe gameplay seems watered down - I got bored within a few minutes.  The multitasking is nice, but I still felt like there wasn't really anything to do.  I don't like the loading screens and the closed off feel.\n\nInterface - 2/10\nI didn't like the new interface at all.  It was a huge pain to do anything.\n\nGraphics/look - 2/10\nCartoony - that's all I can say.  Even the Sims 1 looked better than this.  This kind of look works in some games, but not in a life simulator - especially when the previous versions were very realistic.\n\nPerformance - 9/10\nThis is the only area that has improved from previous games.  However, I'm not sure that it's worth sacrificing all the other things for some performance.\n\nAll in all, the Sims 4 is incredibly disappointing.  I actually returned my copy because it just wasn't worth it.  Maybe after they release more content it will be more fun, but as of now - no thanks.  I'll stick with the Sims 3.;Incredibly disappointing
38;185.0;1.0;10.0;What sucks here is that you cannot give a game zero stars. The Sims 4 IS playable, but only to those who are new to the franchise. If you like the looks of this game from the trailer the go and BUY The Sims 3 because that is the idea of what they are selling. The sims 3 has open world content with up to 100 lots in a world while The sims 4 IS NOT open world, and has a loading screen between everything (even when you try to visit your next door neighbor) with only 5 lots in a neighborhood. The Sims 4 is a major step back from The Sims 3. In TS3 you can design almost EVERYTHING with cool designs and custom colors while in TS4 you only have the pre-made colors to choose from. 50% of the game is designing your dream house for your sims, and you can barely do that now!!  The Sims 4 IS NOT worth your money. Go and buy The Sims 3 where it's only $20 now and COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!;ZERO STARS!!
14;186.0;1.0;7.0;Horrible Game. We have called customer service on 3 separate occasions and no one is able to help us log in so that our daughter can play the game absolutely horrible;Horrible Customer service
207;187.0;5.0;12.0;Let me start by saying i understand that people are upset thinking that there is less content. I was a bit worried about getting the sims4 because of reviews and everything they took out like alot of you. Luckily i had amazon points that i used to pay for most of the game.\n\nNow for the game :\nI started playing and enjoyed the create a sim, it was very clear and you can customize every body part basically. If you played the CAS demo there is a lot more clothing once you get the game by the way. Getting into the game I played for about 2 hours thinking is this it? But as i played on the game offers a lot more than it's first impression. You go to work and have to do certain tasks to get a promotion but they aren't as tedious as the sims 3 when it was just getting the same skill higher for the most part. For example as a painter you need to complete a painting as a daily task, you don't have to but it helps with your job performance. Then they're are also the requirements such as paint a abstract painting, research art references etc. Then you also have your ambition which so far seems to be seperate from your job, much like real life your ambition and your job may not go hand in hand or they may be similiar in category but require you to do different things to achieve or fufill each one. The game started to get good when i got my sim hitched and had a kid. I know some people are upset about the toddler phase taken away but I am not one of those people the growing up of your child in Sims 3 seemed so repetitive and honestly just a nuisance, clicking potty train or teach to walk a bunch of times got pretty boring to me. In the sims 4 you have a baby and you can age it up to a child whenever you feel like it by having a parent click on the baby and clicking age up. Unrealistic? Ya. But for me i hated the baby and toddler stages they weren't fun to have to play through for me. But if you like the baby stage you can keep them there if you wish.\n\nOnce i aged the baby into a child it was similiar to the sims 3 as you go to school and do homework. You are tasked with gaining skill to level 4 in 2 skills these are similiar to the adults as far as gaining the skill. (maybe a little easier). This is the point I am up to in the game. The best part for me has been this point, the game really shines when you have a household of 2 or more people the sims interaction seems more intuitive and flows very nicely. The multi tasking helps to keep the household alive when doing certain things instead of being cut off like in the sims 3.\n\nContent and moods:\nI know people are worried the game doesn't have alot to offer in the way of content and i was worried about this as well. Luckily i have found that it has alot of different elements to keep the game interesting. The different objects such as paintings, furniture etc. All influence your sims mood. The mood seems like some cheap gimmick when you are being told or shown what it is, but as you play the game the mood can drive the sims to do different activities and help them in their careers. I have so far discovered that if you are a painter if you are in a certain mood such as confident you can draw a confident painting and put it on the wall then depending on your skill it will increase the mood by that amount. The moods have different points which is hard to explain in review but it really helps in the game. Doing things your sim loves helps there mood much like in real life. If you love body building in real life it is the same in the Sims 4 you will have points going towards happy after a good workout and may have points going toward energized. But if your sim isn't that involved or skilled in working out they will get no fun from it, if they have a good workout they may get a point in happiness moodlet. It is hard to explain but all of the moods influence your sims to do different activities and each mood has certain perks and certain downfalls such as the sad or tense or angry mood.\nThey're are a range of different types of furniture and video games some that aren't invented today. As well as some things we do have today such as a tablet. If you buy a tablet your sims can put it in there inventory and walk around with it, use it on the toilet etc.\n\nGraphics: i feel they are more cartoon but also more clear and crisp which means you can make a closer lookalike of a person but it will be more cartoonish, you can google comparisons of celebrities to characters people have made they seem pretty close.\n\nCareers: Not a lot of career choices but at the same time the game has ambitions and other activities your character can do to make money in my opinion it would have been nice to have at least 3 more careers in there but it doesn't really hurt the game in my opinion since their is so much else to do in the game.\n\nAmbitions: Ambitions seem accurate and to me i have no complaints about them.\n\nObjects furniture decorations activities etc: I feel the game has alot of different objects i was unhappy that they only had 2 different kinds of carpets that look the same and not a very wide selection of colors considering they only have 2 kinds. Again not a big deal to me though. Other than this so far they have plenty of different types of things to choose from as far as ovens(you have to unlock one good oven with cooking) Gym equipment they have at least 5 different types and atleast 2 different unlockable punching bags from 2 different career paths. 4 or 5 different easels 3 are unlocked through painting career i believe. Different desks some you unlock through careers and give you mood bonus towards the mood that helps you in your career. And more obviously but i don't want to type anymore.\n\nclothing: The clothing seems like there is not too much to choose from but i wouldnt say much less if it is less than the sims 3 had in it's base version.\n\nToddlers are smaller than adult just btw.\n\nHair styles: I won't lie i wish they had more to choose from but i think they have a wider range than the sim3 base version. Also if you like hats your hair can stick out the way it would in real life now instead of just disappearing under a cap.\n\nObject placement: You can now put something on the wall higher than something else example you can put a mirror above a sink on the wall and then put lights above the mirror and if you have room on a higher wall you can put windows above those lights so on and so forth. This helps also when i was trying to fit things into a smaller room because of a tight budget. You can put things on a diagnol now which also can help with fitting furniture also just more realistic.\n\nBuilding: I haven't spent alot of time building honestly but it is easier. I enjoyed building in the other sims this game seems like building will take less time to do. I ran into less (you cant do this because...) notices so far.\n\nInteractions: More intuitive. More life like. Only problem is if you are having a one on one convo with someone other people may just join in on the conversation. Which is I guess more life like. Oh ya if you are married or have woohoo'd you won't get embarrassed when your partner walks in anymore. Other people you will be embarrassed for though.\n\nI'm tired of typing.\n\nSummary:\nThe Sims 4 is alot more then it's first impression which at first i felt sucked. As you play it is very intuitive and flows a lot easier. I haven't been able to explain in great detail what makes this game better than the rest because i feel you really have to play it to understand. The game keeps you from wasting time on tedious things and seems to keep you more into the playful side of the game. In my opinion this so far is the best sims game i have played BUT I also feel that everyone has a different taste for what they're favorite is and may like the sims 3 more. Btw they also put in a option to turn off aging sims when they are not used or you can turn it on. Also yes you can't drive but it keeps you saving time. The load screens are maybe 6 seconds and keeps people from being tired out by the time you go out. It seems easier to have a night on the town without your sim getting upset which is nice, they throw less temper tantrums it seems.\n\nIm sure there are other things i haven't mentioned but i'm not getting paid for this and i really don't feel a need to continue typing lol.\nBut i hope this has helped you in your decision. Also i couldn't get the game with points for the instant download or w.e. but if you buy the physical copy and have it sent to your house you can use points on that. You still have to install and get the patch it all and all took about 20-40 minutes for me.;I don't normally write reviews but when i do it's deserved.
208;188.0;1.0;12.0;Basically what I think this comes down to is if you were a fan of Sims 2, you'll probably enjoy this game. It's set up very similar, with some  upgrades to the play-style, performance and graphics. If you were a fan of Sims 3, you're probably not going to enjoy it. Now, I'll admit I play the Sims pretty differently than most people. In Sims 3, I cleared out entire towns to make my own and then spent about 5 hours to a day (in sims time) with each family before jumping to a different one. Then I'd marry the kids from the different families together to see what they're offspring looked like. I'd spend hours customizing the colors in the homes to create HGTV style renovations. Fulfilling wants and improving skills just tended to bore me and that's a pretty big focus for this game, as others have already said it's VERY similar to the Sims app. The open world in sims 3 accommodated my ADD style of jumping from family to family, this game I have trouble even beginning to play the same way. Now I'll be fair and say that I have a really good graphics/video card so I never ran into almost all of the issues other's had with Sims 3 and I used a lot of mods and CC to improve the gameplay, which you can't really do yet with Sims 4.\n\nMy advice is wait for this game to be out for a while until they come out with more content and hopefully a price drop. $60 is too much money for what is basically a slightly updated version of the free app you can already play. Compared to Sims 3, this one just seems lacking for me, but again I never had bug issues with Sims 3 which seems to be most people's issue with it.  For now, I'll just be returning it and probably revisit this game in about another year or so to see where it's at.;Not a fan.
213;189.0;1.0;12.0;This version of the Sims has two great features.  Stability and a return policy.\n\nI've been a Sims fan since the beginning, even suffering through the horribly unstable Sims 3, always hoping they'd fix the bugs - which they never did.  This is a step backwards.  Describing it as Sims 2.5 is pretty accurate.  There just isn't much to do.\n\nThe new UI is pretty cool and the game is really stable, but it's also entirely bland.  After 4 versions, I'm finally giving up.  EA accepted the return, and I got my money back.\n\nEA's Rodiek making the threat that if Sims 4 isn't successful, there won't be a Sims 5 is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Making that statement during launch week is simply another indication of how much contempt EA has for their customers.  I've voted with my $$.  I encourage everyone else to do that same.  This shell of a game isn't really worth it.  I'm sad, but I'm refunded.;Sims 4: Flowers for Algernon
232;190.0;1.0;12.0;"What happend?! This is horrible! They went backwards instead if forwards. The graphics are better on Sims 3 in my opinion and the game play options are way better on Sims 3! This should have been the sims 2 not 4! Actually the sims 2 might be better. They took away a lot of interactions and options and didn't really add anything. Also, now sims go from being babies to being kids, what happend to the toddler stage? We went back to the original Sims! Also, you can't freely travel the town, like u can't just walk to your neighbors house, it does some ""loading"" thing. The speed is much better, but that doesn't make it worth buying this! Stick to the Sims 3, it's way better! I'm going back to the Sims 3!";They went backwards!! Don't waste your money!
291;191.0;3.0;12.0;Fellow Sims Lovers,\n\nI have been playing Sims since it the original way back when. I have always loved these games and probably always will. I gave this game 3 stars for several different reasons, but let me be clear about one thing first. This game has a lot of potential and we all know how EA Games are and Maxis. They love to release games and give us expansions. So even though it may not be everything you wanted and more right now, doesn't mean EA Games & Maxis won't make it be that way. I do enjoy playing this game and I was really hesitant about getting it at first, especially since of all the bad reviews it has gotten so far.\n\nPros -\n\nThe reason the creators of this game lowered the system requirements is so less powerful computers can still run this hefty program. I know a lot of people have complained about it but I really like they way the graphics look. It's like they went back to Sims2 and made them better. This game also runs a lot faster even though they are load screens for other lots now, it doesn't take nearly as long as it has in the past with other Sims games.\n\nThe create-a-sim is really a cool feature that they have made better. It's much easier to customize how your Sim looks and it's less cookie cutter. I always felt Sims looked odd if I went out and tried to design something myself. Another thing is, they have a lot more clothes and hair styles than I was expecting. I read several Amazon reviews that they're boring. For a starter game, they're a lot better than they have been in the past and there's a lot more styles than it seems.\n\nThe emotions is another feature why I know this game will be fine in the end. They really focused on how and what things affected your Sims. If your Sim goes to the computer and searches for memes then they'll be in a playful mood. Or if they watch a romantic movie then they'll be in a flirty mood. It's really cool how it affects how your Sims talks and walks as well because of these emotions.\n\nCons -\n\nThere are odd little things missing that you wouldn't expect. Like dishwashers. They are just nonexistent in this game! There are also no more toddlers, which was probably one of my favorite stages. I loved dressing them up in cute little outfits and designing their rooms. There are no cars and not even carpools for when they work. They walk everywhere they go. The teenagers also don't look very much different from the young adults. Just slightly shorter.\n\nThe price!!! Definitely not worth the 60 USD.\n\nEven though I know they will release expansion packs, I wish they added the little things I had talked previously about.\n\nWould I still suggest this to others? Yes because it will only get better. They always do. They never just start a new series of Sims and have it picked up right where it left off from the last series. Sims 3 was kinda boring at first too! Don't forget that.;This game has potential
296;192.0;4.0;12.0;But I didn't. Yesterday, I saw the ups truck and was so excited. I was going to return the game as soon as it got here but I decided to give it a chance and I'm very glad that I did. See, I don't love the games that have a built in story line. I love the games that I can play on and on, and enjoy forever. Sims gives me that, and I don't mind spending 60$ on a game I'll always be able to go to. My main flaw with sims 3 is that I wanted better graphics. Everything else was fine. So sims 4 fit the bill for me, regardless of everything not added in. I would have loved to pay twenty less on the game, but I'm just glad I have it because I'm really enjoying everything. I'm glad I didn't psyche myself out because of the negative reviews. Sims is a game that I play for a while, get bored of it, and I go back after a while when new expansions are out. And that's how it should be. I don't understand why everyone thinks a game should be able to entertain you forever. Because no game can. But sims has always been able to take up hours of my day, and leaves me wondering where it all went. And that's exactly what sims 4 did for me yesterday.\n\nIf you're iffy about the game, realize that if you're never settled with the base game, you should wait until more expansions come out, because the price of the game will probably go down a bit and it'll be easier to buy it without regret. Hope this helps you guys on the fence decide.;I thought I wasted 60 dollars.
308;193.0;2.0;12.0;I have played every incarnation of the Sims, and this is by far the most disappointing. With each previous version of the Sims something new was added that made me drop the previous version without hesitation. In Sims 3 for example, it was the open world. But with the Sims 4 I haven't seen anything yet that really impresses me.\n\nIm not even going to go into all the things that have been removed so that they can sell them to me in expansion packs. Maybe if EA releases some free upgrades to the game, I might change my mind, but so far I have to call BS on this one.;"An overwelming sense of ""Meh""."
351;194.0;1.0;12.0;Please do not buy this game. EA has made this game boring hey but don't worry the game will become fun with a price tag of 20 dollar dlc.;ONE PROUD FRANCHISE TURNED INTO THIS
390;195.0;4.0;12.0;"If I could give the game 4.5 stars, I would. Let me start by saying that a year and a half ago, I never would have purchased the game. Early screenshots had terrible graphics and ""emotions"" sounded utterly stupid. In fact, until about a month and a half before release, I didn't even want the game. However, somehow I got chosen as one of the first round of beta testers for the CAS demo, and let me tell you--it stunned me. I was able to create my friends and family in PERFECT detail (with several hours of work, mind you).\n\nThere are definitely some bugs that got left in the game, most likely due to EA rushing the game out. However, I want to give a point-by-point review, as any good reviewer should do.\n\nThe GOOD:\n*streamlined gameplay--build and buy mode are combined, as are hairstyles/makeup/clothes when recustomizing your sim outside of CAS\n\n*CAS is friggin' AMAZING!\n\n*loading screens are never more than 35 seconds long--even when travelling between worlds\n\n*the worlds are BEAUTIFUL, albeit in a different way than the sims 2 or 3.\n\n*there are a TON of hidden gems, such as (spoiler alert!) pregnancy tests and digging up time capsules\n\n*bars come with the base game :)\n\n*CAS is extremely expanded for children and elders, likely because they didn't have to waste that time on doing animations for toddlers\n\n*babies sound, look, and act more realistically\n\nThe CHANGED:\n*Create-A-Style (CASt) is implemented differently--there are ways to customize things, and while it definitely isn't nearly to the extent the Sims 3 was, the styles available are very nice and definitely keep the game from lagging/crashing, like TS3 was won't to do\n\n*terrain tools: due to a set height (because of foundations, etc.), and for the same reason as there are currently no pools, terrain tools are limited to just rocks, trees, flowers, and terrain paint. Honestly, this is one of those things I never really used--I always far preferred having flat lots, anyway\n\n*cars -- we're back to just zoning in the lots, y'all\n\n*worlds -- this is my favorite and most loved change: each of the two current worlds is made up of several mini worlds: a ""rich"" neighborhood of two homes, a ""middle-class"" area of 3 or so homes, a ""poor"" area of 5 or 6 homes, a park, and a strip mall. Within these mini-worlds, free-travel is just fine. If you want to change mini-worlds (or visit the other world and still keep your relationships!), you have to sit through a loading screen that lasts about 3 seconds. It truly combines the best of both TS2 and TS3\n\n*story progression -- story progression is limited to ageing up. Your neighborhood will age with you, but due to computer constraints (wanting to please less wealthy customers, mainly--not every casual gamer wants to have to buy a completely new rig for the sims!) there will be no new babies or relationships unless you enable them.\n\nThe BAD:\n* no swimming pools or toddlers, which everyone has mentioned. I've personally never used either very often, aside from aesthetically, so it makes no real difference to me.\n\n*no memory system (this wasn't in TS3 base game, either, so I'm sure it'll be in a free update, just as the memory system was)\n\n*no family tree?! (family trees weren't well-done in TS3, but they were at least THERE)\n\n*there are very few items, which is normal for a base sims game, but my LAWD sometimes it feels empty.\n\nAll-in-all I give the game a solid 4.5. Don't buy this if you're just expecting the Sims 3 with better graphics. Because it truly is a completely different game. Maxis finally did something right--Sims 2 was a revolution of Sims 1, whereas Sims 3 was just a prettier Sims 2 with an open world.\n\nI've long said this, and I'll say it again. Each Sims game in the franchise has had one thing it's focused on most: The Sims was a life simulator. The Sims 2 was a generational life-simulator intended for story-telling. The Sims 3 was an open-ended, customize-able, generational life simulator.\n\nAnd the Sims 4 is a life simulator that tells realistic stories, based upon real, human emotions. You truly find yourself empathizing with the poor creatures.\n\nI definitely recommend to fans of the series willing to step outside of their comfort zone.\n\nAlso note: to those who are having demon babies, have you tried going to the hospital (click on the sim to go to the hospital, just like you would have in TS3)";Don't buy this if you're just expecting the Sims 3 with better graphics
398;196.0;5.0;12.0;I've really enjoyed playing the game! I never really got in to The sims 3 as much as I did with The sims 2. But with this one I can definitely see myself spending as much time playing as I used to with the first 2 sim games!;I've really enjoyed playing the game
399;197.0;3.0;12.0;This new generation of The Sims 4 has a lot of potential for the future. The graphics are beautiful, and the game play is very smooth, but for a base game it lacks a lot of what previous base games had, which probably is gonna be put into paid DLC or expensive $40 expansion packs.;Could have been much better.
11;198.0;1.0;6.0;Love the Sims 3... this game took us back in time. Totally disappointing.;One Star
98;199.0;3.0;11.0;Engaging at first, but then gets boring after a while. Many features missing from Sims 3 that makes this one feel like an inferior version. A lot of the personality developments are good and I think the emotions are a nice add. Well, not really the emotions themselves, they're kind of annoying at times, but I do like the new actions that come with the emotions. Luckily I got my copy on Black Friday so I didn't have to pay full price.;Not worth it at full price
119;200.0;1.0;11.0;"Do not waste your money. For those who have played previous Sims games, you already know they come with activation codes. HOWEVER, no with this craptastic Origin addition, you get a code that only works ONCE. That's it. So when Origin updates and decides to delete your game from its downloads, despite it still being fully loaded on your computer, you won't be able to play. It will continue to ask you for the activation code (which you supplied at installation) and then refuse to take it because its ""already in use"". Origin is a piece of crap. Don't waste your time with this only to stew in endless frustration and disappointment.";Do not waste your money
61;201.0;1.0;10.0;While the title of this product specifically says The Sims 4 - PC/Mac (a title that did not change when I selected the disc purchase rather than the online download), you will not be able to simply install your game using a CD/DVD drive. Because I live in an area where the internet quality is poor, I chose to purchase the disc, hoping to save hours of download time for the game alone. However, this is not the case for Mac users. While Amazon did send me a disc (which only indicates PC install), they did not make it clear that the disc would be completely useless and only the access code inside would be of use to me. So, instead of simply installing the game, I had to download Origin AND The Sims 4 with my poor internet quality. While I have always been a happy Amazon customer in the past, I am extremely displeased at the lack of communication Amazon has displayed on this product. Here's to an hour so far of download, and another six hours more!;Internet Access Required
150;202.0;5.0;11.0;"*UPDATE 10/10/2014: My People Magazine came this week and rated The Sims 4 #4 among all recent games in every platform.\n\nI can tell from what I've read that about 85+% of these reviews were written by people who never played the game. These reviews are based on early information that EA gave us about the game and are rarely written by people who own the game. They are telling you what they ""believe"" the game to be rather than what it really is. I own the game and have been playing it for a month. This is a REAL review of the game.\n\nFirst, The Sims 4 is not The Sims 3 with 11 expansions packs and 5 additional years of development behind it. No base game is. And being someone who is actually playing the game I can tell you that it is a very enjoyable game. Are there some glitches? Sure. I haven't had any but I've read that others have. But they are putting out update patches several times a week to address all these issues which says a lot for the dedication of the company.\n\nAs far as Gameplay is concerned it is a fun game. The sims are more animated and show moods, they get excited about things. People think that's no big deal but my sims in The Sims 3 were always blank and had no feelings about anything. They can also do several things at one time which they never could before. They can eat and drink and talk all at the same time. Or garden and chat, just like people do. The Sims 3 didn't have that capability. When they go out somewhere there are always people. This wasn't even true through all 11 expansion packs of The Sims 3. I would send my sims out for a night on the town and even at the HotSpot in town there was never another sim or, if there was one, they would never interact with your sim. The venues, like the gym or the nightclub or the museum, are always packed with sims. When you go to a club other sims come and sit at your table and join in on the conversation. The lack of interaction with other sims was one of my biggest complaints about The Sims 3. So this is a HUGE change from The Sims 3.\n\nAnother thing you learn as you play the game is that you get more clothes, furniture, etc. as you go on in the game. The few outfits they let us play with in the Creat-A-Sim demo -- another thing a lot of these reviews are based on -- has expanded three fold in the past month. And EA has reintroduce Ghosts to the game and announced swimming pools -- another big complaint issue -- will be back in November. Again, it's a base game.\n\nWhat The Sims 4 does have that is very different is that instead of one Lifetime Wish for your entire game life, your sim can have many aspirations and gets various rewards for achieving them. In the past month my sim has completed six aspirations, the Sim 4 equivalent to the Lifetime Wish, and has any number of them to try. Along with the Aspirations there are also the Careers. You can be an Astronaut or a Space Smuggler, build your own spaceship, and watch the ships fly into space to collect booty and, very likely in the very near future, aliens. And building houses is now something that everyone can do, not just the creative few. You just pick up a room and set it down. The rooms come in all shapes. Then you pull them until they are the size you want. Add more rooms or floors. Don't like where a room is? Pick it up, furniture and all, and move it somewhere else in the house. The house will accommodate. What's not to like about that? I'm not even creative and I can make a great looking house.\n\nWithin one month of gameplay we have had all the updates and changes I already mentioned. By November, which will be two months, we will have pools back (a big complaint by those who chose not to buy) and I imagine that the much missed toddlers will be back well before any expansion pack comes out. I always hated the toddler stage anyway so I don't really miss it.\n\nThere are too many good things to mention here and I just wanted to add about reviews from people who don't own the game. Others have written good, extensive reviews of additional aspects of gameplay.\n\nI gave it a 5. I would have given it a 4.5 only because it is growing. It's a good game and I truly believe it will end up being better than The Sims 3.";**BEWARE OF REVIEWS!!  MANY REVIEWERS DON'T OWN THE GAME**
151;203.0;1.0;11.0;I've played Sims 2 and Sims 3 regularly since the beginning including almost all of the expansion stuff packs.  I still remember with pleasure some of my sims, sim families, and the homes that I built for them.  I gave Sims 4 several playing sessions, and I shelved it.  I will not play it, and I will not buy any expansion packs because I do not think the game can be fixed.  I bought this copy as a gift, and I was so disappointed that I had to find and order a different gift.\n\nIf Electronic Arts does fix anything, they must fix the time it takes to eat and to shower.;Had to order a different gift
156;204.0;1.0;11.0;First off, I will start by saying I returned my copy of Sims 4. It just wasn't worth it. I'd rather play Sims 3.\n\nPros:\n-Great graphics\n-Multi-tasking (so cool and innovative. You can do things like read on the toilet)\n-Careers are hard, gives more to the game play\n-In game technology (computer hacking, texting) is much more modern\n\nCons:\n-Emotions. Game designers promised us this would be awesome, but I felt like Sims 4 offered less traits and characterization than even Sims 2 did. You get to pick maybe three traits and then a lot of it seems up to chance. I want to create stories and customize my Sims.\n-Loading screens (what is this, 2005?)\n-No Create-A-Tool. I loved in Sims 3 being able to customize EVERYTHING. Now that's gone, and honestly they didn't give us a heck ton of options to replace this feature.\n-No toddlers. Really EA?\n-Glitchy. I understand now they've updated plenty of patches, and this is to be expected with any new games. However, one of the main reasons I returned my copy was the number of crashes and glitches, and then a total lack of assistance from EA's help center.\n\nIn fact, at one point my game crashed and totally erased my save file. Not just lost game data. The whole file from the last week of game play. In Sims 3 it was easy to recover lost data, but Sims 4 seemed different. So I went through a very long and exhausting process to contact EA and learn how to recover Sims 4 files, only to be given to a poor employee who was clearly overwhelmed with other customers and admitted to me he had no clue how to help me, because he had never even seen Sims 4 yet.\n\nEA used to be my favorite designer, and maybe they'll fix a lot of these problems with expansion packs. But honestly, I am not at a place where I want to put any more money into EA anymore. Overall, I agree with most other consumers who have bought this product: Sims 4 was a major step backwards in terms of the Sims franchise.;Hugely Disappointing
177;205.0;1.0;11.0;I'm so mad I could spit. I should have just taken my money and used it  for toilet paper. It would have been put to better use than wasting  it on the Sims 4 pc game. The first day I played the game it was a big disappointment due to the many reasons already posted in the reviews. But today I decided to give it another shot. I just spent over sixty bucks on this stupid game, so I was determined to find something about it to like. I get a message that says Orgin has crashed. Send error report and then restart. After doing this several times I decided to just try to start the game, after all I had the hard copy from Amazon. But no... you actually have to go through Orgin, otherwise  all you get is a screenshot of the Sims 4 logo and the game WILL NOT START. I can't even begin to express my anger! What it comes down to was that  I just bought myself a very expensive empty box.;The Sims 4-Be warned
179;206.0;2.0;11.0;I've played the Sims back when it came out in the 90's and have played every new generation of it since then but this new one is just a huge disappointment and an even bigger waste of $$$!!! Sure, the graphics are great and all but in my opinion the Sims 3 is by far the best. I think the developers of this game focused too much on the build-a-sim portion that they just ran out of time for the rest of the game-play aspect.\n\nThe predecessor to S4 had more dynamic, you could literally have your Sim go into town to party or go shopping or watch a movie on a date without the screen loading because all your Sim had to do was hop into their car and drive into town while you followed them. You could even go to your neighbors without a problem but with the S4 just going to your neighbors the screen has to load. You're literally STUCK in one place the whole time. It's pretty much like the S2 where you can go as far as you're able to in your area but that was it.\n\nEA put too much hype into their new project that turned into such a HUGE let down. Not to mention that the commands are different, rotating and screen scrolling is a pain in the neck, and I had to look online for cheat codes to figure out how to turn off the tutorial because the Game Options didn't have an on/off switch. The selections in build/buy mode feel limited and restricted and the worst part is all the cool stuff my Sims had in S3 aren't even available in S4!\n\nTo all the hard core Sims fan out there who share my frustration, I hope you'll do your friends a favor who haven't played the S4 yet to just keep playing the S3 and save their $$ until this game's price goes down. To any curious shoppers who haven't played the Sims yet, I suppose this would be a good starter for you, but I would recommend hunting down the S3 because it's simple to understand and there's soooo much more offered.;What a HUGE let down!!!
196;207.0;3.0;11.0;"I'm really disappointed in this game.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but it doesn't even compare to the Sims 3.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of the Sims 2.  Every time you want to leave your home lot it has to load just like when traveling in Sims 3 to a foreign land.  However, it does load quite quickly.\n\nCons\nThere are so few venues and lots.  I have not figured out how to edit the map yet, so maybe it is possible to change this, but even if it is possible, everything would have to be built by scratch.\nThere are only 4 public areas\nThe gym\nThe lounge\nThe museum and\nThe park\nThere is no longer a toddler stage\neverything seems to take longer - for example, eating takes around 2 hours at times.  A two hour lunch seems a bit extreme to me.\nNo self employment - though you can make money in the traditional ways - gardening, painting, fishing.  But there is no place to ""sell all fruits and vegetables"" or ""sell all fish"" so you have to delete them out of your inventory manually.\nAlso - the fish go bad after about a day in the inventory.\nThere is no color wheel, so customization is very restricted.\nVery few professions.  I don't think that there is a business path at all.\nYou can only license one song per instrument at a time.  So if you planned to live on royalties as a violinist - think again.\nThe gardening is a bit of a pain.  Instead of just planting seeds, you need to buy gardening boxes.  Then you need to ""evolve"" the plants into better quality rather than them just doing it on their own.\nThe lots are not very big.  I like to build sprawling estates, and that isn't really possible on a 30x20 plot.  Maybe I can change things in the current ""world editor"" but I haven't found where to locate that yet.\n\nPros\nIt is easy to change both hair/makeup and wardrobe.  You can use either a mirror or a dresser to do both.\nIt loads very quickly.  It doesn't require nearly as much video/memory or whatever prior version used that made it run slowly.\nMore hairstyles that I would actually use\nThere are suggestions for baby names - nice since I often can't think of one for boys.\nIt's easy to get your sims to do things when you get them in the right emotion.  For example, if you want your sim to have a crazy workout day, get them energized with ta brisk shower, and they will run their legs off (not literally).\nOverall, this game is not worth $60.  Maybe an expansion pack will make it all worthwhile, but if you haven't bought it yet, I'd hold out.";Not worth 60 bucks.  Wait for the expansion!
204;208.0;5.0;11.0;I like this game I like the modern touch and I feel like ea did a good job I feel like everyone comparing it to the sims three are making false analogies like comparing a stadium to a house and all that stuff they don't have I never used Or cared for anyway so I reallllly like this game time flies by when I'm playing this game cuz it's just so fun and challenging;Combo of sims 2 and 3
219;209.0;1.0;11.0;Should be zero stars. A usable sims4 game will cost you $1000 at least.  Basically a stripped down Sims2, with VERY few options for items to furnish your houses, no dishwashers and 500 other missing things to make your house a home. NO ability to customize or make it your own. Constant load screens, although each is SLIGHTLY quicker than sims3. Just try walking across the street! (Go get a sandwich)\n\nNo open world.  Basically they took Sims FreePlay and decided they could sell it on PC for 70 bucks.... hmm.... I'm not an idiot, be real.\n\nStick with the sims2 or sims3 both have TONS of content and are much better than this empty shell built for tons of DLC to line EAs pockets.\n\nPros: hmmm let me find some first... slightly better CAS (worth 70 dollars? You decide, and then return it quickly before time runs out)\nCons: Boring... no content at all, built for you to pay hundreds for enough content to make it moderately playable.\n\nPlay the free android version. Much more FUN and MUCH more content!!!\n\nAnother thinly veiled attempt to exploit a once Juggernaut series. Now, I wouldn't play it even if it were free.\n\nRemember the SIMCity debacle. EA learned nothing! Try this and see (just use the EA return guarantee before it runs out!)\n\nLike many other critical reviewers my original review was deleted. (likely replaced by a positive EA employee review...);EA says:  Show me the money!
222;210.0;1.0;11.0;Worst game ever - Don't Waste your Money, its nothing like the other Sims games, in fact its worst than Sims 3.... Its so bad I am willing to give this game to anyone who wants it $20 dollar and you can have my orgin acct contact me @ touthoj@hotmail.com;Worst game ever - Don't Waste your Money
228;211.0;1.0;11.0;My last review was deleted from some reason.... hmm.\nThis game is horrible, save your money. There are no toddlers, the babies are attached to their cribs and you cannot take them very far from the crib, the emotions are broken, there are too many loading screens, there are hardly any service NPC's, there's no transportation as sims just teleport to the location along with a loading screen, the environment is a fake backdrop of all things, the graphics are very cartoonish, there are tons of clipping, loading screens get longer the longer you play the game, there's no CASt and the presets are horribly lacking!\n\nAlso there is a nasty bug where children and adults sometimes feel flirty with each other. EW!!!!!\n\nSave your $60.;Pathetic
230;212.0;3.0;11.0;"As so many other reviewers have already said, The Sims 4 is lacking in many ways. Before buying it off of Origin, I saw the reviews saying things like ""there is barely any content"" and ""I got bored after a few hours"". For me, buying this game is a lot like when your friend tells you ""UGH that movie is so bad!"" and you suddenly want to see it because you want to know how bad it is. It wasn't as horrible as I was expecting, but when you consider the experience, resources, and track record with the Sims franchise, this game is a lazy attempt to milk money out of the fans. EA and Maxis are capable of something better than this, and the excuses fans have been handed thus far (such as lack of resources, lack of time, trade offs, etc) are just plain B.S.\n\nCreate-A-Sim:\nIt does look cartoony, but I think it is more visually appealing than the previous Sims games. It also allows for further diversity in looks than the previous ones did (you can create different Sims with varying ethnic backgrounds, whereas I felt trapped in either a choice of black or white with a slim set of options for anything else). I don't think the new CAS is as ""intuitive"" as it seemed at first. It's difficult to get the look you want because it isn't always clear how sliding the features affects them until you change views (profile to facing forward, etc). The walk styles and other minor characteristics were interesting, but I didn't like them much. Many of the walk styles were obnoxious. The tiny list of traits to choose from was a bit of a bummer, too. The lack of CASt is a bit of a disappointment especially for the clothes that don't quite have the design or colors you want, but for those who didn't use it much, it probably wouldn't be missed. More disappointing than the lack of CASt was the lack of a color wheel, which leaves you about 10-15 options for hair, eye, and skin color. No more alien skin tones or special eye colors, no more highlights and low lights. No more dyed hair (unless you choose from the two styles provided).\n\nBuild Mode:\nThe new options in Build Mode, such as adjusting the height of windows and walls, creating round walls, and dragging and dropping rooms was nice. However, the potential of the build mode is difficult to realize. Everything is limited by confusing controls and lack of options, especially for doors, windows, wallpaper, and flooring. Edge scrolling is wonky and slow. Camera movements are done through either right clicking (and holding) or arrow keys. The option to tilt the camera no longer exists. At the start of a new game, you are given a choice of three empty lots that you can build on, all of which are quite small. Other than terrain paints, you can't do anything with the terrain, which is both a blessing and a curse (you don't have to flatten the lot, but you don't get the option for varied terrain). No more pools or multilevel foundations. No more basements. You can't edit public places as you could in Sims 3. Added options are not very appealing to me, such as planter boxes beneath windows and clover-shaped windows. One positive aspect is that build and buy mode are now the same, so you don't have to switch between the two.\n\nMultitasking:\nMultitasking was, of course, an improvement over the limited task queue in the previous ones, but I find it odd that sims doing the same activity (eating, watching TV, etc) don't automatically initiate conversation with each other. Also, they will often times continue their conversation rather than moving on to the next action in the queue, meaning that you have to manually cancel their conversation if you want them to move on to doing something else.\n\nEmotions:\nEmotions were very over-hyped and not very interesting after the initial 15 minutes of play. The emotion you feel is easily influenced by what type of shower you take (I'm serious) and giving yourself a pep talk in the mirror. In this sense, it isn't very realistic, nor is it very useful. Your sim's emotion can open up two or three new interactions and affect your sim in minor ways (such as giving them different wishes related to their mood or changing their walk style). Not very polished.\n\nResponse to general complaints:\n- There aren't enough options here to even consider this a BASE GAME. This would have been closer to an expansion, especially comparing it to the content and options available in Sims 3 base game. Everything feels limited, even more so without the CASt.\n- It might seem like the ""missing"" content is small or unimportant, but when you add it all up, it shows in the game. No pools, no toddlers, no burglars, no ghosts, no story progression, no basic careers, no family tree, no editing of public spaces, no cars, no rabbit holes, loading screens between EVERY lot... Where does it end?\n- The game options were also very limited compared to Sims 3. Your choices between lifespan length is ""short"", ""normal"", and ""long"". How ""long"" is long? How ""short"" is short? The free will was either totally autonomous or no free will at all. Not much of a choice.\n\nIn conclusion, The Sims 4 may not be the worst game, but for the $60-70 price tag with all the gutted features, it definitely isn't something I'd recommend. I've already requested a refund from Origin, and I suggest that anyone with the same morbid curiosity as mine do the same.\n\n(May 2016 edit):\nAs you can see from the fact that I'm updating, I was unable to get a refund from Origin. My boyfriend originally bought the game for us to try, but when we requested a refund, we got no response until 3 days later, after which we were told that we couldn't return it because we had missed the refund window (even though we requested the refund after only having the game for 2 hours). Instead of pitching a fit, my boyfriend and I agreed to just forget about it. I'd been through this type of stuff before, and it was almost never worth the hassle. ($65 bucks for hours worth of back and forth calling and e-mailing? No thanks.)\n\nI forgot about it until weeks later, when my boyfriend told me that some new additions had been made (pools, basements, aliens, the tragic clown, and more clothes options). I played for a while to see all the new things they added. While I do have to commend Maxis for frequently adding new updates with new clothes and build mode options, I think it would have been much better for them to have these little things ready when they initially sold The Sims 4. It would have made the loss of fan favorites more palatable. With these additions via updates, it has become a slightly more fun game, but it still feels a little bare without custom content that I've added (such as furniture, traits, etc).\n\nComparing Sims 4 to Sims 3, I feel that Sims 4 has a lot of potential that Sims 3 didn't have. If Maxis listens to fans and introduces expansions that feel worthwhile and fresh, I think that the Sims 4 can be even better than Sims 3. However, many key features of Sims 3 were taken out that don't seem to make sense, and unless these features are reintroduced, fans will still be a bit disappointed.";Initial base game was disappointing, but it seems that Maxis/EA are trying to listen to fans.
240;213.0;1.0;11.0;"I have been with the Sims series since the original Sims and honestly this is a giant disappointment.  Graphics? Nothing special, especially considering what they managed with the Sims 3.  Content? Lacking many basic features (which they probably will make you pay to get later). And the biggest thing; those blasted loading screens are back every time you wish to visit a different lot.";Hmm......
270;214.0;3.0;11.0;There are MANY reasons not to like this game. Anyone reading this already knows that, I'm sure. But actually, I find the Sims 4 to be better than I assumed.\n-I really enjoy the multitasking, it really makes learning and making friends a lot easier!\n-The rhythm of this this game is also very well thought out. When I play Sims 3, all I get is lag. But Sims 4 is smooth and fast.\n-I love all the different options you have for conversing and interacting, but I'm sure they won't seem so awesome once I get used to them.\n-Updated interface! At first I didn't like it. I mean, Sims 1, 2, and 3 each had a similar interface. But after looking more into it and spending time looking through the different categories, I say it is better! Minimal, stays out of the way and simple.\n-The entire game is beautiful. I love the new Sim look and the way they move about. The colors are perfect! Everything artistically is perfect! Well, in my opinion at least, ha ha.\n\nThere are a few things I do not like about this game however:\n-Moods seem to go down really fast. As an example, my Sim was fine in the bladder category, then went down to average... then BAM all the way down to red. Maybe time is just going fast but wow, that is annoying.\n-Little neighborhoods. I do like that they went back to the Sims 2 format (though many people do not), but I want more lots! I want to build a lot of houses! I want to have more options for living places! Gah! EA WHY?! But it is cool that they give us two neighborhoods to start with.\n\nOverall, I am enjoying the game. Yes, I am sad that we can't swim, no toddlers and many other features were taken out. But when you just look at the game as is, and don't compare it to it's predecessors, I like it!;Better interface, speed and interactions. Though I am still somewhat disappointed.
284;215.0;5.0;11.0;Imagine a world in which The Sims 3 never happened. This game is what would have been the next logical upgrade to The Sims 2. Which is great for me, I LOVED The Sims 2 ....was not a fan of The Sims 3. However, if you are really into the open world, story progression life...this game is not for you.\n\nI did find the mouse control changes to be annoying, why did they switch rotation/scrolling buttons? It's annoying trying tor relearn the controls. Also, edge scrolling is very slow...hopefully that gets fixed in a patch soon.;If you loved The Sims 2, this is the game for you
293;216.0;2.0;11.0;I followed everything that was said about the Sims 4. At first, I was excited and I pre-ordered it in 2013, but the more I heard about the game, the more I was disappointed. This was not going to be a good game... I canceled my order and continued to follow the news. Finally, I could try the game on the PC of a friend before buying it.\n\nWhen the game started, it was all white... everything was different. I was like : oh nice, this is new. Then I created my Sim and finally started to play... my first thought was : man this look exactly like the Sims 2. The graphics are awful and I run in Ultra mode. It is just like in the past! And then, I was like : well, emotions must be pretty nice... but after some time, I realized that it was nothing new. We already had it in the Sims 3, but under another name. It was the mood. Not this detailed, but still the same thing. When the Sim was it a bad mood, it was impossible to make it do something, just like the Sims 4.\n\nI really don't like this game. The waiting time when you change lot are awful. What is that? WHY? I had all expansions of the Sims 3 on my laptop and It was as fast as the empty Sims 4... I won't buy it. This is scrap with a lot of thing missing. I'm not talking about the expansions of the last opus, but about things that were with the last bases games. I have been a fan of The Sims since the first opus. Not anymore.;This must be a prank...
294;217.0;1.0;11.0;I am pretty disappointed in this game. I agree with what everyone else says, you like being able to make job choices for your character? Not in this game you can't. Not only that but when your character goes to work, you can't open any of the panes to see what is going downhill like Sims 3.\nThe build/buy mode is poorly made and again like others have said, the fun of being able to make your house your way is gone. The house seems very boring, the lots are small and you only have a few places to place characters. Overall I feel the only neat thing about the game is how much detail you can spend on making your sim. After that, it's boring. I plan on trying to return this game and sticking with Sims 3 or Sims 2.\n\nI would NOT recommend this game to anyone at all. Maybe if it were 30$ it would be worth the price, but for 60$ I expected much better than I got.;Guess it's back to Sims 3 for me
307;218.0;1.0;11.0;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Waste of money!;Waste of money
310;219.0;2.0;11.0;I am waiting for the expansion because this game is incomplete!;EA, REALLY?!?!
311;220.0;4.0;11.0;"I'm beginning to wonder if a lot of the negativity surrounding this game is just people who forgot what it's like to start with a base game. Every time a new Sims is released everyone is up in arms about what is not there and how they've been cheated. Expecting something to be exactly the same when you have sources showing it won't be is not the best way to go about your life.\n\nThat being said, this game has several points that really appeal to me:\n\n1) The speed and smoothness. Sims 3 for me was a nightmare. I had months where I couldn't play at all because it took 30 minutes to boot up and then would crash once it was loaded. I used mods to enhance the game play (and fix bugs). The characters were usually dull looking and I spent so much time waiting between actions that the game was frustrating.\nSims 4 runs like a dream and there are no rerouting issues or time wasted. It actually moves so fast I have to pause to keep up with interactions! Actually, the only complain I have with routing is how often people walk in on others in the bathroom and get embarrassed. (I'd download a mod for that!).\n\n2) The graphics. I don't even have my settings on high and they're already clear and beautiful. I was worried about this before I started playing but I'm pleased to see there won't be a problem even on my 4 year old laptop. The character designs are much more ""cartoony"" than Sims 3 and is sort of a throwback to Sims 2. I loved the look of Sims 2 so this appeals to me.\n\n3) The genetics. The kids look like a lovely blend of their parents. Kids also have little lifetime goals and school goals as well. It's hard to get good grades!\n\n4) I like the new clothing options. Besides having clothes that match better, there are five open slots per category and if you fill them all your sims will rotate between them every time they change clothes. Pretty cool if you ask me. Also there is no longer maternity wear - THANK GOODNESS.\n\n5) The odd little details. The characters do random little things depending on their mood. Multitasking is the best example of this. Sims can be reading and then need to use the bathroom. They'll get up, carry the book with them in their hands (not inventory) and continue reading on the toilet! They can drink and eat at the same time, they'll start to eat and then start watching tv, you can call or text at the same time - it goes on and on. To read more amusing things we've found out (and read some encouragement) you should check out the ""Did You Know"" thread on the Sims 4 forum (http://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/776337/sims-4-did-you-know/p1).\n\nSome things I do not like:\n\n1) I miss the toddlers. I like having that extra little bit of time of little kids crawling around. That's just me. Pools I can live without for now and you know that they'll be implemented later.\n\n2) I miss having more careers and rabbitholes. There are many less careers to pursue and not as many places to visit. STILL, the world is big enough that I've played for several days and still haven't taken the time to check it out. You could explore for a long time if you don't barge into it and cheat with your moodlets. The careers actually make you work, though, so that makes it much more challenging.\n\n3) I wish there were more lots. To be fair, my game hasn't progressed far enough I'd need more but I would think eventually I'd need a few more for family members if I start a legacy game.\n\n4) I miss the family tree! I loved the family tree and it's funny how I took it for granted. I'll have to keep track on my own until it's (hopefully) implemented.\n\n5) I wish there was a better way to see how old someone is that's not in your household. I've had several young adults date/marry adults and then have them age up to elders shortly after they've moved in together. I guess it's more realistic that you don't know but it's a bummer when you were expecting a long life together.\n\nIn conclusion, if the price tag is a little much for now give it some time and come back to it later when it's gone down or they release a new expansion pack.\n\nTL;DR\n-You will probably like this game if you prefer the style and personality of Sims 2 and want a smooth and playable experience.\n-It's possible you won't like this game if you expect the size and openness of the Sims 3 world.\n\n* I should give this four stars for a buggy game start but I know that they'll fix the issues. By buggy I mean I have the demon baby problem (google it) and that married Sims don't share the same last name.\n\nETA: changed it to a four star review as a ""perfect"" one apparently offends, ha...";Breathe. Relax. Take a moment to read the positives as well as the negatives everyone is spouting.
317;221.0;5.0;11.0;I do not understand the negative comments at all!  I play Sims 3 and played Sims 4 now for several hours.  Its a different game play folks!  I do not see how you can compare the two. Clearly, Sims 4 is going in a different direction then Sims 3.  If you liked Sims 3 then play Sims 3 - this is not Sims 3!  I look forward to the expansions.\n\nMaybe it is just me but I am NOT missing all the things they took away!;Great game play refreshing changes!
328;222.0;2.0;11.0;It's a pretty game, but that's it. Like others have said, it has potential, but it is far from being playable. The game gets boring after an hour, unlike many of the other Sims games where I'd find myself playing all day and night. It's missing so many features that made the previous Sims games worthwhile. It's definitely not worth $60-$70. Obviously, the game was rushed and it clearly shows. Save your money right now and wait until some expansion packs are released.;Beautiful graphics, but overall really disappointing and not worth the price...
335;223.0;1.0;11.0;I have played Sims since the beginning, and bougt all expansion packs but I'm done, its disappointed me, and wasted my money;why do this?
336;224.0;3.0;11.0;"I've been playing the Sims since 2001. I have never NOT preordered a sims game or EP, and this is no exception. Granted, I did wait til THE LAST minute to do it. Literally hours before release, I finally bought it through Origin.\n\nMy first impression is: this is not the sims. This is some MMO attempt.\n\nIt's pretty, it has nice artwork and graphics, it has nice sounds and music.\n\nThere are new fun, quirky, funny emotions and interactions for your sims. I have laughed out loud at some of the things I've seen the sims do.\n\nBut overall, this is not the sims. It doesn't look nor feel like the sims. It's tiny, there's hardly anything to actually do. So many core features are gone or crippled. They went 5 steps forward with the intuitive emotions, the graphics, the style, the quirkiness, but they took 10 steps backwards from what they had accomplished in the sims 3.\n\nThere's no more open world, they reduced personality traits. They took away an entire life state, they took away underwear and swimsuits, pools and cars. We can't really edit or create or build our own lots aside from houses. We can't edit the world at all (that I have found); even in the sims 2 you could plan out your own neighborhoods to some extent.\n\nThey gave back the loading screens. Our sims now magically teleport where they need to go; they don't even get into a taxi and drive off the lot, they just poof.\n\nThere is potential to grow, but the base game is stripped to pieces and pretty awful. It's also buggy as hell. The bugs are mostly minor, but frequently recurring and some are difficult to correct.\n\nI can't recommend it to anyone at this point, but I can say I am HOPEFUL that they will give us some patches quickly, and give us some free crap.";It's okay..
410;225.0;5.0;11.0;I have been playing the sims since the first one and I feel like the sims 4 is a great improvement especially in graphics and the way the sims carry themselves in a more realistic manner. The variety of emotions are great and I love the create a sim. How about we talk about all of the things they added instead of all of the things they left out? Yes they left out toddlers and pools, we get it and I wish they were in the sims 4 too but it's called expansion packs. Everyone is saying they took a step backwards but they made lots of improvements in other areas. If you read the reviews on the sims 3, people are complaining about it also. You can't please everyone and they will make up for what they left out in expansion packs so I think we all need to chill and enjoy it .;I think it's great

92;227.0;1.0;10.0;This is just a disk to install Origin software so you can download the Sims4 game from the Origin site. It's not like the Sims 3 where it installs from the disk. I live in the boonies and have a slower internet with limited downloading and streaming so after 4 hours Origin wasn't even installed. So after paying over $50 for this Origin install I wasn't even able to play the darn game I wanted. I ended up returning this as I didn't want to have to have Origin and I wanted the game to install from the disk as the previous games in the Sims series.\n\nJust a warning if you have a slower internet it probably will not install correctly if you can get it to install at all. Total bunk, if I wanted to download the game I would've just went to the website. I wanted an install as the previous games. Very disappointed that I didn't even get to try it after playing this series from day 1. Though from reading the reviews, I don't think I'll be missing much. I will have to keep my old laptop to play the Sims 3.;It's not like the Sims 3 where it installs from the disk
32;228.0;1.0;8.0;I didn't buy this game until it had been out for a while because of all of the terrible reviews that it was getting.  As of 4/5/16 it looks like I was smart in doing that because it seems to have come a long way since it was originally released.  HOWEVER that does not mean that this game is good by any means.  They added a few things since The Sims 3..emotions, the ability to multi-task, create a sim, and the sims look better than they did before, but that doesnt make up for all of the stuff they took away.\n\nThe Sims 3 did run terribly on most computers.  But if you used mods to clean up your town, it was fine.  I don't understand why EA didn't just work on cleaning up what they already had in The Sims 3.  Instead, they took away the open world, which I would have been okay with to some degree, had they not cut the size to 1/8 of what it was before.  Literally there are like 12 sims living in my town.. its stupid.\n\nI also HATE the controls on this game.  It really bothers me that I cant change the angle in which I view my sims.  This is especially annoying in build mode.  It just feels awkward.\n\nMy #1 complaint is that this game iswell Ill just say it..boring.  I used to be able to get lost in The Sims 3 for hours..now Ill sit down to play The Sims 4 and Im bored in like 20 mins.  Nothing seems to flow in this game..Im not sure if its because of the loading screens or what it is, but the game just doesnt feel the same anymore.  I even bought an expansion pack and Im still just bored.\n\nHopefully in the Sims 5 they will take the good things that they did implement in the sims 4 and add them to a community they existed in the Sims 3.. until then, EA isn't getting any more of my money.;Don't waste your money
99;229.0;1.0;10.0;I have played every sims game since Sims 1. I have never been so disappointed in my life. This game moved about twenty steps backward from Sims 3 and now just seems like a slightly better Sims 2. You can't even travel or build lots around town and it is an annoyance to try to go places. Sims 3 was so much better and I'm probably going to uninstall this game and continue playing Sims 3.\n\nWhat a waste of money. Oh well.;I have never been so disappointed in my life
106;230.0;1.0;10.0;This was my pick for my early Christmas Gift to myself.  I got in on the origin sale on Black Friday.  Even with the big discount I ended up regretting my purchase.  I've played all the iterations of the Sims, and each one had it's own good and bad traits...  This however I just can't like anything about Sims 4.  It's extremely boring for me.  The play is too liner and confining.  I can't play as I like or do the things I want with the game.  Half the content objects are locked and you can't even use it without going through loops to unlock it.  The endless loading screens drive me nuts, and they get longer the more you play.  The neighborhoods [Because I refuse to call them worlds.] are tiny.  You only get a few open lots to customise. I feel like all the best and most awesome upgrades from the Sims 3 have been stripped away.  If you loved the Sims 3, save your money.  They cut out the open world, create-a-style, story progression, toddlers, and pretty much everything I enjoyed doing.  Ugg, I don't know what else to say about it, except that it was a miserable disappointment all around.;If you were a fan of Sims 3 read a lot of reviews before you purchase.

Then, the Sims 3 promised to be everything you wanted in the new release and they delivered on some level but the Sims themselves lost something, not to mention the extremely unnatural voices they gave them.\n\nWhen I read reviews of the Sims 4 I had decided not to bother with it but finally, yesterday, decided to give it a try. H*O*R*R*I*B*L*E!!!!!!!\n\nThey took away everything from the Sims 3 like the open world platform, the ""part of the neighborhood"" feeling, the design controls to match furniture and objects,  and went back to loading screens when ""traveling"" between lots.

123;235.0;3.0;10.0;"I was excited for the Sims 4 but after playing it for a few hours, it's very clear to see how much EA intended to gouge people in terms of DLC. A lot of things that have become standard in prior sims games are now gone although it's very clear they intend to add them in later in exchange for more money. I'm getting tired of forking out more and more money to get a complete game after paying 60 dollars for it in the first place. The sims games have been notorious for this in the past, but this is the ultimate slap in the face.\n\nEA quickly realized their mistake and has touted ""Free Updates"" with the addition of ghosts and pools. But I'm sure they fully intended to charge DLC for them in the beginning and that's the part that annoys me. It seems like a rushed product that they fully intended to nickle and dime people for and I'm glad that horrible strategy that they've had for years has finally backfired on a blockbuster title.\n\nThe sad part is that the game is actually fun for awhile, until you quickly run out of things to do.

You make good on that, and you'll see happy gamers.";Missing content, future nickle and dime machine
125;236.0;1.0;10.0;I pre-ordered this game and by the time I got to play it I couldn't refund it. It is boring. It only has 2 towns with 4 community lots and the towns are very small. This game is so limited to what you can do in it. There is absolutely no creativity when it comes to create-a-sims other than your sims. You can't change hair colors to exotic colors or even when you want to change the color of your sims clothes to the color you want it to be.;The Sims 4 is boring.
33;237.0;2.0;8.0;"I bought this game on release day, pre-ordered it actually. I'm reviewing this more than one year after this game was released to give myself plenty of time to get to know the game, and to give the developers time to fix the game that was unfinished when released. I don't mind the cartoony graphics for the 4th iteration, and I don't mind the closed world with the loading screens. Is it a step back? Yes, but it's not game breaking for me.\n\nWhat is game breaking, is that baby sims aren't really real sims. They're more like an object in the sense that your sim still has to put them back after EACH INTERACTION with the baby. The baby can never really leave the crib, and the last time we had this was in The Sims 1. The baby then ages up to a child, completely missing the toddler stage we grew to love in The Sims 2 and The Sims 3. Some might say the toddler stage annoys them, but you have the option to age the robot baby up whenever you want so I don't see why they can't give us toddlers that we can age up whenever we want. One would think that the 4th installment would have more life-stages (add pre-teens and middle-aged sims), not less.\n\nTo add insult to injury, teens look exactly like young adults, who in turn look no different that regular adults. They all pretty much have the same interactions, the same clothes, the same height, the same body build and the same walk styles. The same goes for elder sims- same clothes, same height, same everything, but with wrinkles. So really, there are only two life stages in this game: child and adult. Not good if you are a family player.\n\nThe family tree is broken, and sims get culled constantly. If you are a generational player, you are out of luck my friend. You will see sims you play disappear because there's not enough room in the world for them. You won't have enough space to build houses for everyone because the base game has 2 worlds + 1 mini neighbourhood...barely enough space if you like to build a lot and have a lot of sims. Now, it is great that you can travel between worlds and move houses to a different world, but everything seems more limited this time around. The only thing worse than the disappearing sims is the fact that after 1 whole year, the incest bug is still not fully fixed.\n\nThere are no more cars- that's right, no carpools, no cars, no school buses or taxis. Sims just disappear, and you get to watch a loading screen. There are decorative cars that drive around the neighborhood but they aren't real and will go right through your sims or anything in the way. Sims can't ride in them, nor do they acknowledge the existence of these cars.\n\nI am also quite disappointed by the lack of things to do. Even though this base game has more items than any other base game, it's mostly clutter. Your sims will spend a lot of time on their phones, because technology. Everything is done on the cell phone, there are no more house phones. Yep, the devs have communicated and said ""who uses house phones anymore?"". They should talk to people living in tornado areas and rural areas sometime, oh and everyone else who works in an office. They also got rid of newspaper deliveries because it's outdated. They really did say all these things through their forums and twitter accounts back when they used to answer our questions (they have since pretty much gone silent on when it comes to feedback like this except when discussing bugs and new dlc), and it makes me sad as someone who has been playing the game since The Sims 1. It seems like they just want to push out the older audience and only attract younger players. Everything in this game is quite PG and the humor is quite juvenile when compared to previous iterations.\n\nI could go on and on about what it doesn't have all day. I gave it a 2 star rating instead of 1 because they have been consistently patching the game every month, adding some of the missing features back in for free and others in DLCs. For example, this game was released without pools, but they did patch this in for free. The devs also patched in dishwashers back for free something like 10 months after release date (yup, the game was so incomplete it came without dishwashers. There are still no trash compactors in the game).\n\nAs a longtime fan, I'm still holding out hope that the game will crawl out of this dark place. There are pleasant improvements to the game, but until the family play aspect is seriously improved upon, I will not be purchasing any more DLC or spending any more time on this game.\n\nP.S. The first Expansion Pack, Get To Work, is a big joke. It is nothing like Open for Business, and I get that it's trying to be creatively different but opening a store is so boring now. There are no cash registers, everything is done in the tablet. I added this little blurb in case people are thinking that EPs will make the base game better. The answer is not really. Even with the EPs, GPs and SPs, it is still an overall 2 star experience for longtime players looking for an improvement on the old Sims games.";Still bug-ridden, still missing core gameplay features we saw from previous installments
134;238.0;1.0;10.0;I was expecting something way better then the Sims 3 with this new game, now instead I feel like I wasted my $60 on this game and if I could get a refund for it I would but I wasn't smart and bought the downloadable copy instead of a disc that i could have returned. This game yes has better graphics and the sims are much more life like with their movements but this game is pointless. I think EA needs to do some major changes to this game like stat and give us a patch for the changes or they will have alot of angry customers.  Like previously said its like they reverted back to previous games like the orginal sims and sims 2. What happened to the toddlers? Now u have a baby for 3 days cant do as much with it like u could in #3 and birthday comes and now u have a child. No thanks EA guess I will stick with the sims 3. Total waste of money.;I was expecting something way better then the Sims 3 with this new game

Secondly, you didn't check if it was for mac or not? REALLY.\n\nI dislike this game because of the fact the in-game AI is so horrible. The Sims 2 had better AI, and it was clearly more entertaining than this pile of steaming garbage. I spit on EA's Maxis. They killed Simcity and now they killed this franchise? #@!*ing idiots. Very little improvements like always...actually the ""improvements"" made the game worse.\n\nI'm so glad to say that I didn't spend $60 when it came out, and sure as Hell not going to spend $50 now. I played it in my cousin's house and he tells me he doesn't like the game either...thankfully he got a full refund within 2 days.";Real reason why it sucks.

No customization or patterns, there is NOTHING to do in the game.  You can't walk around town, there are LIMITED places to go, hair and clothing options are minimal.  Forget trying to make a sim that looks ""just right"" because without being able to make custom eye, hair, and skin colors (let alone make up colors) you're just out of luck.  MAYBE they will fix some of these oversights, but for some reason, I have this horrible feeling they won't.  What is the point of this game???";The Sims 4: Boring Edition
163;242.0;2.0;10.0;Eat, sleep, work, learn, that's what I feel like I'm doing in The Sims 4.  I've been playing The Sims for 10 years now and this newest release of The Sims 4 is just boring.  I read the reviews about how The Sims 4 was lacking in comparison to the The Sims 3, but I decided to give it chance.  I have to give EA credit for it's new take on CAS and building mode.  What would usually take me 7-10 days creating my Sims and building a house took only a few hours, but once I began the actual game play it all went downhill.  Now that you no longer have the open world it feels like your being held hostage in your own house.  There was something about being able to zoom out and look at your surrounding world in The Sims 3.  It made it seem more realistic and let you explore different places.  The need for a loading screen just to travel to different venues gets old and it makes you just want to stay at your home lot. Sure, they revamped the CAS and the building mode, but that alone doesn't make a good game.  If EA had just made those two changes and left everything else the same from The Sims 3 base game I would be singing EA praises.  I could even forgive them for making me log into my origin account just to play this game.  In conclusion,  I'm going back to playing The Sims 3 and I won't be buying any expansion packs for The Sims 4.  Maybe I'll consider buying The Sims 5 in the next few years if  EA decides to continue with The Sims games.;Booring!
35;243.0;1.0;8.0;I pre-ordered this game from EA when they announced that it was available to order in 2014. I anxiously awaited the game as was thrilled when it arrived. With that said I cannot tell you the last time I played this game. I have played The Sims since the very first Sims. This game is just the first Sims reinvented as a new version and is highly disappointing. They reeled back functionality that was available in the Sims 3. I wish I could return the game for a refund. I went from an avid fan to someone who cringes when you mention the Sims. Here are some of the major game changers:\n\nYou can only operate one sim at a time if they are on different lots. For example if you have a sim at the library and another at home, you are unable to go back and forth controlling them as you were able to do in previous versions.\n\nNo open world: Sims cannot walk around the neighborhood and meet new people like they were able to do in the previous version.\n\nThe dynamics of the background are lacking.\n\nIt is quite possible that EA has fixed these things in expansion packs. I paid full price for a game with half the features of the last one.\n\nWith that said if you love building grand homes then this version allows you to do it more easily.;The original Sims reinvented as a new version
176;244.0;1.0;10.0;Don't waste money on this game. Huge disappointment. Very boring. Terrible camera.;Wish I could give it zero stars
185;245.0;3.0;10.0;"On the whole, I see that most of these reviews, especially the ones at the top of the list, come from people who have played the Sims series for a long time. I have not. I got the original Sims a billion years ago, and played it for a short while. A very short while. So, I decided to check out how the series has come along in all these years with a fresh and unbiased expectation.\nTo start, I definitely found it more engaging than the first one. Although, there is also a time factor, and an aging factor involved (in myself) that it's hard to say for sure which element exactly played a part in my enjoyment of the game. Is the game actually better? Or is it that I'm just older and more patient? It's impossible to say without reloading the original one. Which I'm not going to do.\nAs I began playing, I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. My Sim seemed to be coming along fairly well. Being new to the game, I had some trouble making ""friends"" with many other Sims (5 of which were required to level up my chosen aspiration.) By the end of the game, to be honest, I found it still fairly difficult to keep many ""friends."" (You'll see why that word requires quotation marks further in this review.)\nMy experience quickly turned quite dark. I hadn't gotten too far, when suddenly my character turned ""old."" This was quite upsetting, and extremely depressing in a context of real life. By all means, it was not a mirror of my own, but I had no idea that aging would happen so quickly in the game. Suddenly my Sim found himself old. He'd gone nowhere in his job, he was single (never even had a date,) and he barely had enough money to keep his bills paid. My Sim would very likely be contemplating suicide at this point. I couldn't help but think of old adages about thinking you would have more time to do things with your life before it became too late.\nAt that point, I was kind of bummed out, but resolved to start over and perhaps start at a younger age. I wasn't looking forward to essentially killing my old character and making a new one, especially because I spent quite a bit of time trying to make him look like me. So, I poked around online and found several things of interest. The first being that you can turn off aging. I would definitely have turned this off if I had known how little time (to me) that you would have before time ran out. So, I checked that box. Then I did further looking, and found there were some codes to make your Sim young again. Sim Brad was restored to his youthful vigor, and ready to take a swing at life again (although his old man belly was impossible to remove and remained with him through the end of his days.) It really was this option, or to start over, so I don't feel that constitutes as actual cheating (I feel like cheating in general takes away the fun from games.)\nBack in business. This time, I resolved to try harder to get more friends and make a proper life for myself. It started going quite well indeed. I found after a while that juggling multiple neighbors would make them become friends, and one in particular ended up growing to become more than friends. I started getting promotions at my job, and I was enjoying the game quite a lot. I moved in with my newfound love interest, and quickly transformed my new home into something that would accommodate both of us. All was well.\nAnd this continued.. for a while. I really was enjoying the game quite a lot up until a sudden point where I realized that I had run out of game. After getting myself used to the game so I could play it properly, I noticed that there really wasn't all that much to the interactions between the various Sims. You make friends by continuous and constant positive interactions with any given person, regardless of ""personality."" I talk to so and so X amount of times, and now we're friends. So and so likes coming over and likes talking on the phone. So and So fairly regularly shows up at my door unannounced, and strangely, with no doorbell ring or knock on the door. They just kind of stand there for hours (creepily in the fashion of a few modern horror movies, especially if you hit the fast forward button), until you notice them and let them in or they go away.\nWhen I do let So and So in, they may say hi, and we might have a short conversation. But, more often than not he/she just wanders in and starts playing a game on my computer. These Sims are obsessed with my computer, and any given one will take the first chance they get to use it. Which is weird. You don't just enter a home and play a person's computer constantly, regardless of your status with them without at the very least saying, ""Hi!"" It's like letting some kind of computer using vampire in. Once you're friends, there's no stopping them. No matter of your relationship with them, they just do whatever they want based on the items in the environment, regardless of the context of their visit.\nI realized that this was literally all the game had to offer. Sure, you can have parties, make food for everyone, dance, drink, whatever, but every interaction is completely random and unrelated. I can go and grab an instrument, or the microphone at my own house party, and 90% of the time my guests will completely ignore me. Sure, they eat up all the food, and leave their plates and cups all over the place, which is amusing and realistic, but that's about it. The whole game is just: Continue interacting with other Sims until they ""like"" you, and then you'd better keep it up because they will quickly begin to stop liking you. It's literal maintenance, like pumping up the tires on your bicycle. I realize life it kind of like that; you have to maintain your friendships if you want to have consistent interactions with them. But friends I haven't talked to for some time in real life won't revert back to literal strangers! And if we have become estranged, I wouldn't have to constantly re-invite them, and have small chats just to elevate them back to ""friend"" level. They also wouldn't just come into my house without talking to me, only to use my computer.\nThe neighbors also have no context outside of your life and relationship to them. They do nothing until you interact with them. They don't have jobs. They don't have any real relationships. You will never see the same two Sims come into the bar on a regular basis to hang out. Not to mention that even if you invite/bring a number of Sims to a location, they won't have any particular interest in hanging out with you depending on what interactions and activities that are directly surrounding them. If I take a bunch of friends out somewhere, while I don't expect them chained to me by all means, I'm expecting to have a good time with my friends. Not just to watch them scatter completely with no concern for anything other than what they specifically choose to do at any given moment.\nAnd that was all the game has to offer. I had a really good time with it up until those realizations, which is sad. And I'm pretty sure that no measure of add-ons or DLC adding new locations, or swimming pools, or anything of the sort is going to change this fundamental repetition. For the fun I had while it lasted, I would give this game a solid 4-5. But the fun has run out, and all I have left are the memories of the time I enjoyed the game. I would give it a 3.5 overall, but Amazon doesn't allow fractions, so it rounds down to a 3. If you've never played a Sims game, first and foremost, I would wait for the price to drop. The time I enjoyed with the game is not worth the amount they are charging (despite being the consistent going rate of games these days.) On top of that, if you've read this review, when playing the game on your own you will likely begin to notice the problems I had with enjoying the game more quickly than an unbiased person such as myself had. So that's going to lower your enjoyment level further. Sorry about that.";A slightly less biased review
26;246.0;1.0;7.0;I don't like that they took the world map away from Sims 3 where you could see your sims walk, jog, and/or drive to place to place. It's like they took a step backwards. now it's like when you go somewhere you get a loading screen and then you appear at your location. They need to bring this feature back.;The worst change to the game
214;247.0;5.0;10.0;I hate to feel like the only one saying this, but I really like TS4. I have played all sims games since the beginning. Yes, I miss a lot of the elements that people are complaining about, but this is a brand new game. There will be a ton of features added through expansion packs.\n\nThe number one complaint I see is that you only load a small part of the world at a time. So, if you want to travel to the museum, for instance, you have to endure another loading screen. To me, this is a HUGE POSITIVE!! The loading screens never take any longer than a minute on my computer and that's much better and more tolerable than the 6+ minutes TS3 took to load!\n\nSo, on the rare occasion that I want to send my kid to the park to play on the monkey bars there, I will sit through a loading screen.\n\nThe game also has some really fun features with your aspirations and your career goals. Things are broken up into milestones and you have to meet certain requirements to pass the milestone and work towards the next step in achieving your goals. It's very fun to have these little tasks to do.\n\nAlso, emotions are very fun to play with! I wish it was a little harder to manipulate emotions, but I'll take what I can get! I love how your sim will have different interactions available when they are in a certain mood. Going to school focused also boosts a sim's performance! I've found this to be a fun feature to play with. My sim also got pregnant from a random guy who was walking by her lot one day. So, I moved him into the household, but when he proposed she denied him (for some unknown reason, but if I had to say, I think it was because of his terrible facial structure) and he died of embarrassment right on the spot. Then my sim proceeded to get chummy with the grim reaper and still calls him sometimes! There was an achievement flashed on my screen for befriending the grim reaper!\n\nNow, onto building improvements! As a primarily live-mode player I really don't care too much for building fantastic homes. I prefer the quick and simple and my goodness does the new build mode cater to that! You have new features which allow you to choose from many premade rooms and just plop them onto your lot. You can resize them as you please. Then, you can also just decide to pick up and move the entire room on a whim, or you can move your entire house! It makes adding and editing your sim home so much easier. The only thing I truly miss is the auto roof. It might still exist and I just can't find it. Also, pressing F4 while in game brings up a menu where you can browse user created content. There are already so many beautiful homes, rooms, families, etc already waiting for you to use!\n\nYes, it is a bit sad you can't build swimming pools, yet they put a lot of effort into making fountains elaborate. Do I get it? No... But I see an outdoor living (or some similar name) expansion or stuff pack coming out in the future with this option. How many players out there even used their pools? My sims never went swimming...\n\nAnd maybe you will miss being able to turn off floor elevation restraints and using terrain tools to make these crazy homes. I don't miss that stuff because I was never a master builder. What I do know is the master builders out there are still finding a way to make amazing content.\n\nIt's a great and fun game, so I'm not sure why everyone is giving it all the bad reviews. If you all were expecting a clone of TS3, then why don't you just stick to TS3?;I hate to feel like the only one saying this
238;248.0;4.0;10.0;"Frankly, the press was dismal, starting with the inane commercials.  And watching the live plays was somewhat useful, but it doesn't cover the way it feels as a player to be in the game yourself, directing things or watching them unfold, depending on your style.\n\nIt's so familiar, yet Sims 4 keeps surprising the player with sweet little touches that speak to the characters and feelings of the Sims.  Not just what they feel in the moment, but what they feel about each other.  There is the daily many little expressions and options that string together to make this game a rich experience unlike the previous three games.\n\nYou'll hear people go on and on about the multi-tasking.  That's because it's so great and makes game play more logical and satisfying.  Now, your Sim can eat his cereal and talk to the rest of the family at the table while also drinking a glass of juice or watching a tv show.  Your Sim can start dancing to the stereo at the local bar and invite everyone in the bar to join.  As soon as she's ""introduced herself"" to any of the other Sims, they become involved in one giant conversations, while dancing at the bar!\n\nThe game isn't necessarily easier, despite being more intelligence.  The player still needs to figure out the best way to deal with needs and rising and falling emotions as well as how to pay those more realistically large bills that show up once a week.  Better make sure you're doing all you can to earn promotions or painting your little heart out for extra cash.\n\nBuild and buy really are easier to use.  The feature of adding in premade rooms is genius and a lot of fun.  Collectibles are still fun, venues and parties are still fun, all the fun is still there.  Toddlers and pools are missing.  If you can live without that, Cast and open worlds, you'll find enough of other items and actions to enjoy.  You can find and breed frogs, gardening is much expanded with the ability to splice plants.  Painting types are expanded, not when you first start the game, but as your Sim builds skills.  The same is true of all skills.  Things open up as a Sim becomes more experienced.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but then which Sims base game was?  It's certainly a worthy addition to the series and right now, it's the only one I want to play.";Deserves Better Press
285;249.0;5.0;10.0;For those of you who don't remember, The Sims 3 launch initially didn't have many features/items either. Maxis/EA eventually added them later in expansion packs/updates.\n\nNow as for The Sims 4 - the Create-A-Sim function is vastly improved - the sheer amount of sim customization is mind-boggling. The ability to change clothing & furniture textures and customize clothing colors is absent at the moment (will probably be released later in some kind of free update) but this is adequate for the time being.\n\nThe new Build mode is also a huge upgrade. Gone are the days of spending 6+ hours building and furnishing a massive mansion for your sim. Build mode now allows a player to plop a fully furnished room and drag out the sides to either increase or decrease the size of the room.\n\nAnother huge improvement is the graphics - woohoo baby! The sims look like real people (gone are the unrealistic jagged edges from The Sims 3) The lighting inside homes and buildings is spot on fantastic.\n\nIf you are unsure about buying this - wait a few weeks/months and then pick it up (give the developers a chance to tweak a few things/release updates).;Truthful Review - no BS
288;250.0;3.0;10.0;Sims 4 actually isn't too bad gameplay-wise (in my opinion), but I'm a little let down by it. I like the graphics, I like the new CAS and build mode, and the new emotion system is really cute. The mulit-tasking feature is pretty handy too.\n\nIf EA had kept pools, toddlers, policemen, firemen, repairmen, story progression, cars, CASt and almost every other feature they removed I'd rate this game 5/5. Without those, the game feels kind of lacking coming from the Sims 3. Don't get me wrong, I don't absolutely despise Sims 4 like at least half the other reviewers, but I'm pretty frustrated with it's lack of content compared to the Sims 2 & 3 base games. I appreciate the new things they added, but I really don't understand why they removed so many aspects of the game, some of which that have been standard since day one, for practically no reason. I think we all would have been more than happy to wait longer for them to release the game if it included everything EA removed.\n\nTo sum up, I'll be setting Sims 4 aside until a couple of expansions and stuff packs are released that hopefully include some of the stuff they left out. Until then, I'll continue playing Sims 3.;Meh.
306;251.0;1.0;10.0;Somehow this game feels like a giant step backward.;Giant step backward
318;252.0;3.0;10.0;For those folks who are upset, remember with the Sims 3 - how buggy it was.  EA does not employ dozens of in-house software engineers to search out all the possible bugs.  It's inefficient.  Rather they release the (inferior) product and then allows the millions of the very talented members of the worldwide  gaming community to find the flaws (which they quickly do) and EA then issues subsequent patches/updates.\n\nAlso it appears obvious that this is merely a bare bones base game and EA will aggressively sell DLC, more so than with the Sims 3.\n\nHaving said that obviously the price should not be 59.95.  I would put the value closer to $19.99 to 29.99.\n\nWhat we learn from this is do not be the first to buy, you will be disappointed.  Wait a few weeks or after a patch or two.\n\nFinally, maybe the Sims 4 isn't that bad....maybe the Sims 3- in its finality- is that good. Just sayin';History repeats.
344;253.0;4.0;10.0;I have been playing Sims since day one (year 2000 I think?) and have enjoyed each one so far. I don't think everyone hates the game. Unfortunately, a lot of people do.\n\nI'm not one of the fans that downloads mods and customizes each piece of the game, so I don't miss being able to put whatever print and color on a sofa for my living room. If you are the type of person that customized everything for the perfect home, I can see why you'd lower the star rating.\n\nI thought toddlers were kind of annoying in Sims 3, so I won't miss them. I never put swimming pools at my homes, so I didn't even notice those were gone. I understand there are a lot of people that do miss those items, but if you're a casual Sims player, I don't think you'd miss it too much.\n\nI love the multi-tasking. It does change how the sims interact. I'm still getting used to certain things affecting a sims overall mood. One wrong statement in a conversation and my sim runs for her bed to hide under the covers. I'm also still trying to get used to not constantly staring at needs panel to make sure their hunger is full and they're not too sleepy. I feel like they're trying to get you to not rely on that so much, but since Sims 1, that is something I've always had open. I don't think it's a negative thing. I think they're trying to make changes and take Sims in another direction.\n\nI haven't played too much with building a house yet, but from what I've done, it's gotten a lot easier. I love the new way to create sims. That's gotten much easier also.\n\nWorrying about expansions and what they will possibly try to sell you online isn't something I'm going to do. That's the direction of many games unfortunately, so it's not shocking to me that they will do that with the Sims. You don't have to buy the expansions or extra game content they sell on the website.\n\nI did give it four stars because I feel like the price is a bit steep. Maybe the price should have been $40. If you're wanting to try the game but aren't sure if you'll like it, maybe wait a little while for the price to go down. They always do eventually.;I guess I'm one of the few that like the game...
378;254.0;4.0;10.0;I've owned all the sims games, so I am a big fan. I played Sims 4 practically all day when it was released, and so far I am really enjoying it. Most people who have given negative reviews hate that its no longer open world and so many features are missing. I never enjoyed open world anyways. Why would I? So I can watch them drive in a car to a lot that doesn't have any people in it until two hours after I arrive??!! In Sims 4, there's already about 10 people when I get there. Besides, the loading times aren't that long at all. I hate decorating and designing, so I don't miss create a style.\n\nI find that with this game, instead of playing completely zoomed out, the new facial expressions and interactions cause me to zoom in and really enjoy the socialization. Sims 4 has made me laugh several times already over their new interactions. No longer does it feel robotic. Can't say the same for the other Sims.\n\nBasically, I give it four stars because I love the game so far, but I haven't played it long enough to answer all my curiosities. Yes there are drawbacks, but nothing has been a deal breaker.;All the ones who love it are too busy playing to write a review, but I was able to pry myself away
423;255.0;4.0;10.0;I bought the game anyways because I am a fan and have been a Simmer from the beginning...Even though majority of the reviews are negative I will keep an open mind and I will keep the Sims 3 installed until Sims 4 meets the expectations to keep me occupied... This is what I believe... The game has been revamped.. They are pushing the actual character changes... They want us to focus on emotions and feelings..it is not about the cool stuff in Sims 3... It's a Sims 1 or 2 re-do in a sense... Basic then build from there.... I only hope they start the expansion packs and patches quickly and consistently or fans will not buy into the a Sims 4...  I enjoy making the Sims more unique and kind of glad I get enough time to play with the CAS and see the changes with the Sims... Build/buy mode like the changes.. Not love... Won't love until they hopefully bring back the ability to alter the colors..Do I wish there was more..? Yes but I'll wait until the expansions start to make up for some of the missing stuff and I believe it will get better...A huge plus is that people with older computers can play the game with out having to buy new PC's etc... Like I had to do for 2&3..;Oh.... Boy... Reading these negative reviews had me nervous..
70;256.0;5.0;9.0;"I'm a serious Simmer. I've been playing since Sims 1, plus SimCity since Simcity 4000, so I feel as though I have a good understanding of the Sims ""universe"" and its various nuances.\n\nThat being said, this game is SO underrated. It's disappointing to see so many people who claim to love the franchise be so opposed to the newest chapter of the Sims saga. This is obviously just my opinion, but I will support it the best I can with my experience playing the new game.\n\nFirstly it is true that they have limited the scope of the game in terms of how much you can see and interact with at a time. When I first noticed this I thought my soul was being crushed by a thousand-ton llama, but as I played a little bit, I found that I really like how they've laid out the world. You have a small cul-de-sac at your immediate disposal, which consists of five homes and a park. People are ALWAYS walking by (and not just those from your neighborhood, but even those from the surrounding two neighborhoods). This lends a close-knit communal feel to the game, especially with interactions such as ""complain about local youths"" and ""discuss changes to neighborhood."" Within the cul-de-sack you have access to the complete sidewalk to hunt down anybody passing by with whom you might wish to converse. If you want to go into a house then the game has to load it first (load screen) but as has already been iterated, the loads are short. You also must load to get to the town area (definitely looking forward to improvements to the town, which is currently limited and uneditable) It takes a bit of getting used to, but whatever. It's The Sims 4, not the Sims 3. Different game entirely.\n\nAnd it is seriously different. The most amazing thing is how nuanced the experience is. My Sim was tense, so she slammed the fridge door. My Sims friend brightened her day, and it made her happier. Sims really are more intelligent, and the multi-tasking is so enjoyable to watch. It's amazing to see a vibrant conversation between three friends at the table. It's super cool to watch them scoot closer, or talk and check their cell phone simultaniously. Richer relationships means a more immersive gameplay, and a deeper connection to those you befriend. Already, as just a base game, I'm hesitant to go back to The Sims 3 (with all but 1 expansion). GRANTED, there is a LOT that is 'missing' if you compare the Sims 3 (EVERYTHING) to the Sims 4 (base game) but they're gearing up to launch a huge expansion pack, and people are going to start getting what they want. Those toddlers? wait for generations. Weather? Seasons. They've given us such a huge platform to build on, and every Sim lover should take it for just that.\n\nA few more notes on things I really enjoy about the new sims game:\n\ndates/parties have objectives. Meeting these objectives fills a 'meter' that gauges the success of the event. Then you're graded at the end of a set amount of time based on how full your meter is. This takes a lot of guess work out of these types of social interaction and makes them more fulfilling)\n\nBuild mode is brilliant. I LOVE building and decorating my sims houses, and I felt that the tools they've given this time around are the most powerful and intuitive yet. Create a sim is equally brillian. I enjoy the 'play with genetics' tool and the way you can manipulate features just by pulling and pushing. I created a trio of curvy, materialistic sisters with so much PERSONALITY I fell in love with them right off the bat, flaws and all. Then I built them a lovely little home using the room placement tools and dragging them into the shape I wanted. I do miss the create-a-style tool, especially because sometimes the highest comfort thing isn't exactly the best looking, and it's nice to be able to make the red velvet chair look a bit more modern with a new pattern or a leather texture. A bit sad, but really if that's all I can complain about then I'm doing okay.\n\nLastly, I love how conveinent and effortless it is to switch between households. I like developing whole communities, so this sims-2-ish style of households is great for me. Actually, that's something I've always struggled with in the Sims 3, so I am glad to see them taking that kind of approach again. It doesn't hurt those of us who like focusing on one family, but it's great for creating social webs.\n\nA few downers: Jobs are limited right now (base game), I miss the old control panel (just me being reluctant to let that blue bar go - the new controls are easy to pick up.) and the stuff really is espensive/jobs don't pay so good. I'm gunna have to work for my simoleons =/ Really I'm nitpicking here. Overall I am just so impressed by the social interaction, the greater degree of individuality (even losing one trait slot and having less trait choices) between sims, and the consequences your chocies have on their lives and emotions.\n\nIf you're hesitant now, just wait an expansion pack or two and you'll be bummed to have to shell out so much at once. Any sims lover is going to see Maxis creative vision at work and enjoy this new, fully immersive gameplay experience.";"so I feel as though I have a good understanding of the Sims ""universe"" and its various nuances"
93;257.0;1.0;9.0;I am so disappointed with the company that produces this came. We loaded it on the day after Christmas put in product code. Last week an update for the Origin game provider and the game has not worked since, tried redoing the download of the game and get message product code has already been used. Won't even let us use the game by using the disk. Have attempted to contact company to no avail. Needless to say my granddaughter is disappointed and so am I. I read several complaints on their website about this same thing happening to other people and not getting help from company. No place to inquire what to do. Would appreciate any help or suggestion Amazon might be able to give. Seems like they prompt an update to deliberately disable games.;EA Game issue.
111;258.0;1.0;9.0;Terrible! It is so cartoonish and unrealistic! All of the furniture and decorations look boxy and unrealistic! The colors are terrible! You can't custom design anything or change the color or patterns. Honestly I was really looking forward to this game and its a HUGE disappointment, whoever they hired for their design team SUCKS! I can't even design a house that is half decent looking.  I hate that you can't customize anything, You can't change the appearance of windows, doors, floors or anything! It's all pre-chosen for you and the patterns and design menu is completely gone.  I loved being able to design homes that looked like something out of better homes and garden, now it looks like a android game, cartoonish and boxy and UGLY! The worlds suck, there are no babys, no dishwashers, no trash compactors, you can't place things on dressers or design anything! I hate this game. I'll be sticking to SIMS 3, in my mind it's more advanced than SIMS 4! They took 30 steps back!!!;TERRIBLE! NO IMPROVEMENTS ONLY STEPS BACK!
126;259.0;3.0;9.0;"Updating 12/22/2014 to factor in some changes that came with the patch that introduced the 2 new careers. If Amazon allowed I'd up it to a 3.5 star rating, however still no toddlers so still won't give 4 stars. And yes toddlers would also have to be back in the base game for me to say 30 to 40 was a decent price range.\n\nUpdates I've spotted in game that are nice touches and add a small bit of spark back into the game:\n* UI adjusted: especially for the job/school panel makes all information (other than job level) clearly visible, much easier to know best mood for performance enhancement; phone interface has also been changed now instead of a list there are 4 icons with sub menus.\n* When your sim needs to bathe the grunge is no longer just a green cloud, the sims themselves acquire a layer of visible dirt and grime (this is a first for the franchise, kudo's to the design team)\n* Knowing the age group of the sims you're chatting up is now possible when about town, the age group (I'm only listing what I've spotted so far, but I'd guess it applies for all playable age groups)is now listed directly under the sims name.\n* Added business and sports career tracks complete with outfits, and rewards.\n\nThere are probably more little touches added in, but I haven't spotted them yet.\n\nReview by Mmdrgntobldrgn (aka Mama Dragon) http://mmdrgntobldrgn.wordpress.com/\n\nI purchased my copy through Origin as a digital download and have had it since day one. I made the mistake of installing right away even though I knew I wouldn't be able to play until the weekend because of my uni schedule.\n\nFor game play and content, I did not expect the game to have all the features of the previous series since this is a new base game and a new incarnation of the series. I was also very aware of the missing toddlers and pools; along with the cas limitations. The only reason I caved was because of the new woodworking skill.\n\nThe first few hours I played around with it, on premier night left me feeling very unhappy with the game. I chalked it up to being over cas already because I had played the free cas demo for a few weeks in August. I told myself that I shouldn't rush my decision because I had not had a chance to get properly into the game. Day 1 I would have said 1 star.\n\nWeekend finally arrived and I spent some serious time in the game getting used to the look ... very tween fluffy feel good graphics .... and the basic mechanics of the programing along with the new UI. By the end of the first day of play I felt the game was a 2 star game and was ready to ask for my money back. Ouch! I reread the great game guarantee, because I had installed day 1 it was not eligible. Yes I could have called and argued my case and fought for a refund ...... because I've been simming since The Sims 1 I decided to give it a second chance in the hopes of finding some redeeming qualities to the game. So I have been playing it off and on trying to find ways to get the most from the game.\n\nBecause of the patch in of ghosts and the promised patch in of pools the game has moved up to 3 stars, if they ever Patch in toddlers I'll bring it to 3.5 or 4 stars. I will most likely never give this incarnation of the sims a 5 star rating .... for a 5 star they would have to go back and completely rework all of the graphics and grow up the visuals instead of aging them down for the tween (Disney) crowd.\n\n**What I don't like (besides no toddlers)**\n*In game, if you wish your sim to level up career's or achieve a lifetime goal you have to spend a lot of time on many mini tasks. *The dating meter is back from sims 2, but it isn't just for dates anymore, it's also for all party's and social gatherings.\n*Loading screens, and the fake open world feel.\n*The lack of casT(create a style), because it is a base game and content is lighter than past base games the inability to recolor (without a mod) stands out heavily.\n*Starting base game content is lighter than previous incarnations of the game which is made worse by the fact that about a third of it is locked until you complete certain tasks or career levels.\n*To turn off the tutorial you have to enter a cheat/command code in through the origin interface before you start the game\n*If you are a legacy player, you can't start out on a 50x50 lot (largest available). You have to 1st start on a small lot and then pick a large one to bulldoze, and then move the sim to the large lot.\n*Not a fan of the object baby tied to the bassinet\n*Sims will spend almost every free minute mourning the deceased if not watched, even weeks later.\n*Sims can't paint portraits\n*No family tree's\n* No story progression for townies just like S2\n* Babies go from infant to child, just like S1 with no transition stage\n* Teens are to close in appearance to adults\n* no burglars, handymen, gardeners ....\n* collections tracker isn't 100% accurate, it doesn't include all base game plants or the patched in plant\n* Can't add any space or lots to the limited selection of places, so if you want something different or more you have to bulldoze something\n* not a big fan of the all or nothing new foundations (but I do like the new height varieties/slider that allows for higher foundations)\n* Plastic hair, even if it is a little less plastic than the first promo images\n\n**What I like, and why I'm willing to give it 3 stars**\n* Woodworking skill\n* Despite loading screens each lot/neighborhood area as a semi decent unincorporated surrounding to explore and roam around in before hitting the need for a loading screen. (hence my comment above about fake open world)\n* A decent assortment of musical instruments including violins for children from the start. (If you started with S3 base, you might recall the uproar when piano's were left out of the base game)\n* A few later added expansion/online store(digital content) items have been carried over as base game items; such as the cow plant (which wasn't even in S1 base game, but is a fan favorite; caution it dies easily without Constant attention this time round); violins and the voodoo doll\n* Ghosts are back in and pools are promised\n*The new building tools are nice to work with, and as Ruthless_KK's studio shows it's possible to finally get cleaner build versions of most building styles\n\n**Stuff I'm meh about**\n* plants don't really die, you evolve them to get higher quality\n* back to always nice out, no weather to speak of\n* the wonderful new build features can be troublesome, because spaces have to be enclosed rooms for some of the build features to work properly\n* most of the classic cheats are still around for when they're needed\n\nEnd point, I'm not happy/thrilled with this generation of sims, and may not buy any future expansions, but will still play the copy I have once in a while so my $$ won't be completely wasted. But I really don't advocate getting a copy, especially if you loved Sims 3 and/or toddlers. I still play more S3 than S4.\n\nPS, the weird alien morph baby, shown in one of my pic's, was fixed by ea with a patch in early October.";Save your money & wait for a great sale (20 no higher than 30)
140;260.0;1.0;9.0;I really loved the sims 3 open neighborhood because things would progress outside of your own household and you were able to catch glimpses of others lives. The sims 4 is actually less than the sims 2. The limited neighborhood spaces, very little clothing options and the limited buy catalog actually fits a tablet or phone game rather than a full blown pc game. The graphics may have improved, but you can do less with your sims in the sims 4 than you could with the sims 1. This is a huge disappointment to all fans of the games. I recommend if you are thinking of buying this to stick with the sims 3. If this is the best Maxis and EA can bring and at the price they are charging, there isn't going to be a sims 5. As someone how has played the sims since the expansion pack for the first were coming out, this has really turned me off the franchise.;It's Huge disappointment for long-term fans and casual gamers.
146;261.0;2.0;9.0;"My wife always buys me something of The Sims as a gift and knowing I don't have The Sims 4 has been bugging her. I've been wondering whether or not to bother with letting my wife buy the game. I've played the game since the first Sims, bought Sims 2 and all of its expansion packs just in time for Sims 3 and its expansion packs and worlds. Then there were the on-line content adding to the tally even more. I started feeling ripped off as some of that extra stuff should have already been included. Just changing faces and bodies with a few more options really doesn't convince me to jump on another franchise, which again, will be releasing extra merchandise that won't be free.\n\nAs a dedicated Sims player I feel somewhat obligated to keep up, but the reviews aren't good at all. I've downloaded the free Create-A-Sim for Sims 4 and even that didn't impress me and I could only spend a few minutes at a time because it was pretty boring and didn't offer much new. There were very few clothes and nothing much different from Sims 2 or 3 Create-A-Sim.\n\nI was hoping that I could see them eat, work or go to school and actually be allowed to go inside and not just look at the outside of where they were. I never ever liked the pixelation censor and thought as an adult I could play without it, not that there's anything to see but it should be my choice to turn it off and on. Everyone in their lifetime has seen nude dolls and unclothed never made them an adult or mature toy so why should that change the ratings of the Sims from Teen to Mature?\n\nFrom what I'm reading, nothing much was really changed. The Sim 3 was 5 years old and to keep the interest they slapped a 4 over the 3, or 2. I'm also yet to see what makes Limited Editions much special except paying $10 more. From what I'm seeing, EA/Origin needs new blood and listen more to their customers. By simply saying, ""It's Fun!"" doesn't work as their fan base is finally catching on to the gimmick and sales are dwindling. The Sims just aren't living up to the hype and we deserve better.";More Hype Than Truth

165;263.0;5.0;9.0;"I am extremely happy with this base game; after playing for three weeks and into the third generation of a legacy family, the game has a lot of depth and the basics seem to be a really solid base to build on with expansions.  I have played Sims since 2002. Sims 2 was my favorite until trying Sims 4.  The only thing I miss so far about Sims 2 is that I had built up a very customized set of neighborhoods in Sims 2 and obviously, in Sims 4 at this point I am limited to the two worlds that are largely pre-made and scenery which is not customizable.  If a create-a-world tool is eventually released, I would be completely happy with Sims 4.\n\nSims 3 was a beautiful game graphically and the open world was a nice idea, but to me, the Sims themselves were lackluster and the open world was all you had. The Sims 4 world actually feels more engaging to me.  Within zones of 2-4 lots, your sim can still openly explore parks, the riverside, and community areas or visit neighbors' homes.  Although there weren't loading screens, I was always waiting for objects to render in the Sims 3, very annoying.\n\nThe Sims themselves, and the build mode, are truly the stars of this game, and since the Sims and building are the reasons I enjoy and continue to play the game, I am very happy with it.  Depending on their traits and the situation, and the actions of sims around them, different situations evolve.  My evil sim told her elderly mom she is a criminal mastermind, and the mom continued to be anxious about it for several hours and even the next day at one point.  If you want to go-with-the-flow gameplay, it is really fascinating and fun.  Or if you want to tell stories, there are also plenty of good tools available.  You can easily set up situations by enabling/disabling the emotional effects of different objects, and you can customize aging in the neighborhood on three levels:  current household, playable households, and NPCs.\n\nWhen playing Sims 3, I felt I was playing the developers' game; Sims 4 makes me feel much more like I'm playing my game.  Following my sims' whims causes them to go further into those areas of interest or interaction, ignoring them causes them to not bring them up as much (something I liked about the Sims 2 want system).\n\nOn the other hand, watching the programming the developer's did with sims interactions with each other, when they are acting autonomously, is really engaging and fun.  The autonomy seems deeper, more realistic, and fuller than Sims 3 or Sims 2.\n\nIn three weeks of gameplay I have only seen one glitch, and this is playing one lot continuously and intensively.  It appears to me that this game runs more smoothly than either the Sims 2 or 3 base games and I am very pleased with it.";Builds on Sims 2 and Corrects Problems in Sims 3 basegame...Beautiful and Engaging Game!
190;264.0;4.0;9.0;"I was a loyal simmer for a number of years. It started with the original, which was fun. You were given a world and miniature people to control. Whether it was to make them happy, miserable, or dead, the choices were yours, and varied. The Sims 2 made me nervous, as it changed the way you played with your sims. Rather than a completely open-ended sandbox, you were given goals, with the ultimate goal to allow your sims to lead a happy, fulfilling life.  It added in age groups and death by old age.  The addition of toddlers and teenagers (and later young adults) allowed you to progress through the lives of your sims from birth through death. For the first time, you could play through the lives of your neighborhood and create massive, epic stories.  I fell in love.\n\nThe Sims 3 promised more.  Open worlds. Seamless, free of loading screens. Ultimate customization with Create A Style.  The hype and excitement built. And ultimately I was disappointed. I felt like the series went from being about playing your sims and more about playing your world.  Exploration and interaction with the world and items seemed to trump the interactions between individual sims.  Everything looked pretty (except the sims themselves), but there was little of the sense of fun of the earlier games. Expansion and stuff packs attempted to fill the gap, but for me, the magic was gone.\n\nThe Sims 4 was announced.  Amid rumors of online functionality being stripped from the game, along with items and options that were also removed, the community feared that the game would be a failure.  In fact, some people were so sure that they began to post reviews nearly before the game was even installed on their computers.  I was beyond nervous.  I knew that if this game failed, I would not be buying any more Sims games.\n\nReluctantly, I purchased and installed the game.  The opening menu came up and I hated it.  I clicked on the new game option and braced myself.  I was blown away.\n\nFirst, the newly revamped CAS was refreshing. Many have been upset at the limited color options for clothing, items, hair and eyes.  While there is not a color wheel or pages of texture options, there are enough to put together a basic wardrobe and choose some interesting hair colors for your sims.  The actual creation screen is intuitive, and allows you to create a wide variety of sims with which you can populate your neighborhood.  The genetics are the most fun yet.  I spent about an hour creating my first family.  I actually made a couple, combined genetics, made another sim, combined genetics with the offspring of my first two sims, and repeated for a couple of generations, creating an interesting looking sim that I wished to use as my first sim of the game.\n\nSome have complained about the lack of aspirations and traits, comparing to The Sims 3 and The Sims 2.  What many fail to mention is that the list of traits and aspirations or equivalents were also limited in the base game.  It wasn't until the expansion packs that a sizable number of these personality quirks began to amass.\n\nOnce I had my first sim, I was ready to play.  Here is where the bulk of the complaints come into play.  First, there is no open world.  For fans of The Sims 3, this can be an upsetting prospect. For me, the lack of an open world was a blessing.  My computers, regardless of how top of the line they were over the years (and they were), could never run TS3 smoothly.  There were always lags, crashes and bugs that would render my game unplayable until a patch or more likely a mod was released to alleviate the worst of the crashes.  The lack of loading screens meant that each item and sim in the world needed to load individually.  This meant that even after arriving on a lot in the world, I still had meshes that showed up with no textures for several seconds or minutes, until the textures loaded.\n\nThe Sims 4 solves this by using a semi open neighborhood, with loading screens.  What this means is that when you choose a family to play, it loads the neighborhood they live in, as well as their own home. Once this is finished loading you can wander about the neighborhood and into their own homes.  If you wish to visit the neighbors, or another neighborhood, however, a new loading screen comes up before the neighbors can be visited.  This means that there are no more textureless meshes or sims that are textureless.  Once the lot is loaded, everything and everyone looks as it should.\n\nThe reintroduction of emotions and a stronger focus on interactions between sims has really brought the focus back onto the sims themselves.  In the first two sims games, the sims were characters.  They grew on you as you played them.  In TS2 in particular, they developed a life of their own, falling in love, making enemies, plotting revenge.  Who could forget the first time they saw a neighborhood sim or ""townie"" come by and angrily knock over your sim's trashcan or steal their newspaper.  Much of this liveliness was sacrificed for the open world of the sims 3.  Now, they have made their return, and once again we have funny, strange little people in our games again.\n\nNow, the game is not perfect.  Yes, the toddlers are gone.  If you played the sims 2 or 3, this is kind of sad, as they were cute, funny, and an excellent way to give the next generation of sims a leg up on skill building. They are missed, however, the lack of toddlers have allowed the developers to expand on the children.  Often deemed shortchanged, children have become fun to play.  They build on their own sets of skills, which then allow related adult skills to be built upon once they become teenagers.  Their interactions with family members and amongst themselves make them fun to watch.\n\nThe other omissions are more object related.  Pools, dishwashers, hot tubs, and other items that have been a part of the series for years have been removed.  For many, this is a huge problem.  For me, it is a disappointment, but not a deal breaker.  Pools were something to decorate the yards of the rich folks for me, and the rest of the items were nice to have, but I am not really that upset, now that I have actually played the game.\n\nI am only on the second generation in my game, but I am loving every second of it!  And for the first time since the sims 2, I care about my sims again, and will be sad when the first generation has died.";The cuts made me nervous.  But having played the game...
218;265.0;2.0;9.0;"Well... I don't have much to say that everyone else hasn't said. I have been an avid Sims player since the original, and a true fan! I have been waiting patiently for the Sims 4 to come out; watching every demo, teaser, trailer, and press release since its announcement. I did not pre-order due to the outrageous price tag, and when September 2nd rolled around (opening day) I watched the reviews closely. Sims 4 started off alright at 4 stars, but in 24 hours fell to 2.5. IGN reported Sims 4 around 6.7/10 after a few days, then dropped to 5.4. I hesitated to buy due to the saddening reviews, but yesterday I noticed someone said if you purchase through Origin you can get a refund if it doesn't work out (I wanted to do a PC download). So, I went out on a limb, crossed my fingers, and downloaded it. My thoughts?\n\nReally the only thing Maxis and EA have accomplished here is emotions, which was their selling point to begin with. I tried not to look at this game and compare it to previous versions, but it's difficult! I definitely miss the customization level of the Sims 3, even if I didn't utilize it much. There was something so great about making EVERYTHING paisley, camo, plaid, tie dye, etc. And that is no longer an option. I do like the color options they have provided better than most of these other reviewers, but it's lacking some ""oomph"".\n\nI LOVED Create-A-Sim, despite not having skin/hair/eye color sliders. The intuitive shaping sliders are just phenomenal, but that's really where it ends. I did notice (even in the Create-A-Sim demo) that the controls felt a big... laggy. This translated in-game as well; moving your camera or dragging walls and items was very slow, and I have a great computer. I was shocked by the ""highest"" graphics settings as well. For $60+ I expect the game to be beautiful, and it just wasn't. I only played for about 2 hours and I was unable to find a camera view or option similar to the ""tilt"" function in Sims 3, which I used constantly in that version.\n\nAs others said, missing cars, toddlers, create-a-style, open world, neighborhoods are small, etc.\n\nThey have a good idea here with the new Create-a-Sim and emotions, but I think they would have been better off adding these features into the Sims 3 or bringing that price tag waaaaaaaay down while they make improvements.\n\nIf you wanna try for yourself, Origin has a refund policy that applies if you process the refund within 24 hours of the first launch of your game (and/or a couple of other options; 7 days after purchasing the game, whichever comes first, but check their policy because I'm not certain on this one)\n\nMeanwhile, I'll be returning to some of the hotter titles on the market right now. I'm disappointed in EA/Maxis this time. They may have lost my business forever :(";There was something so great about making EVERYTHING paisley
251;266.0;3.0;9.0;The best thing about this game is the customization capabilities. Other than that, it's a complete waste of money. Hopefully there'll be great expansion packs that'll help spice it up, but this game isn't worth it on its own...;Sims 4? More like The Sims Freeplay 2.0

298;269.0;2.0;9.0;"I was extremely disappointed in the Sims 4. The Sims 4 is suppose to be a better version of the Sims 3, unfortunately it is not. It feels and looks like a better version of the Sims 2. There is no open world, when I first heard this I thought, "" okay so I won't be able to go from my Sims house to the bar without a loading screen, that's OK"" but in reality a loading screen is there even if you wish to walk to the lot next to yours. They've tooken many things out of this game that made the sims 3 BASE GAME fun like toddlers, pools, and create a style. I'm sure EA is banking on the idea that they can make more money on things that make the Sims 4 more of a complete game. This game is not worth the 59.96 it is currently priced at, if you can wait for the price to go down buy it then because with the lack of content and missing features I would never recommend someone pay 59.96 for this game. That said the game is fun just not complete and that ruins the whole experience for me.";disappointed
301;270.0;1.0;9.0;"My only wish is that I could give this game a 0 star. I would love to talk to the developers of this game and find out what they were thinking when they decided to strip the game of absolutely everything. I've played every Sim since they first came out. I had high expectations for the Sims 4. The game was apparently designed around elementary school children's gaming capabilities. Whenever you are designing anything there are a list of choices and you just pick which is your favorite; you really can't edit much. The angles of the game is very annoying to use. When you need to turn the camera you have to click on a drop down menu and then turn the camera. The neighbor hood is broken up into sections that you click on and it downloads. I feel like there was so much potential and they destroyed it. If they could add the new editing of the sim, emotions, and better house designing capabilites to the Sims 3 it would be gold.";Don't Waste Your Money
303;271.0;3.0;9.0;I image that after the next patch is released that this game will become more playable.  For me, it crashes randomly, which begins to get annoying.  I would suggest waiting to purchase this once it is more stable.\n\nThat being said, I think the game has a lot of promise, I was not a fan of The Sims 3, however I love the Sims 2, and have been playing that up until this release.  You need to view this as a new base game, and a lot of content that we have gotten used to is now gone, but the new features do make it appealing, and with a little work, this could be an awesome game, just have to wait and see what EA does.;Don't rush to buy
321;272.0;5.0;9.0;I have been a true fan since the first sims. Alot of people complain about sims 4, comparing it to sims 3 but honestly once I started playing sims 4 I couldn't get back into sims 3 anymore. The only thing i miss are toddlers. Sims 2 was great and this game reminds me of it but waaay better. The sims seem more real more. I didn't really focus on the open world in sims 3, so that's not really missed. I love creating sims, making families, upping my sims skill levels, and throwing parties. And now they have toddlers!! This game is perfect for me! :-) I'm glad I got it.;Fun and Realistic
340;273.0;5.0;9.0;"I have played the Sims since the beginning and I own all expansion pack from Sims 1,2 and 3. I love the Sims 4 and I am shocked to see all the bad reviews.\n\n In my opinion making a sim in the Sims 4 is a lot easier than making one in the sims 3. I think getting rid of the scroll bars in create a sim was a good idea because i think it's easier to make changes. For example: When making giant breast on a female Sim, all I have to do is hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse around until my sim has the perfect size. My favorite thing of the game so far is the gallery. Let's say you hate your sims house. You can open the sims 4 gallery(when in build mode) select the house you like and just like magic you have an instant house. You can move the house any where you want  on your sims lot and you can rotate it. You can also move or delete rooms without using the sledge hammer tool. The only thing I don't like in the sims 4 is the camera controls. The camera controls can be a pain in the ass when building a house. I also think the graphics look GREAT! Like I said before,  I don't understand all the negative reviews. Some people are complaining that there isn't enough to do. Well any true fan of The Sims know that The Sims ""base game"" has always been very basic and then EA releases the Sims expansion packs and stuff packs.";BEST SIMS GAME SO FAR (FROM A TRUE SIMS FAN)
366;274.0;5.0;9.0;I love this game. It is absolutely amazing.\nI'm not saying it doesn't have its faults, but given those faults the other parts of the game are breathtaking.\nThe graphics are beautiful, the animations are perfection.\n\nPros:\nCAS is amazing. It has so much more customization ability.\nThe base game clothes are stylish and up to date.\nThe emotions are pretty cool\nEven without CASt the color options are really good with clothing and furniture.\n\nCons:\nYes, there aren't any toddlers BUT they will be adding them. (what sims franchise haven't you paid a million in DLC?)\nPools (for some this is a con, to me it doesn't matter)\n\nEvery game has its problems, but this one, is worth any problem. It so much better than any other sims game. It doesn't bog down my core i3 computer with a Geforce GTX 660 graphics care like the sims 3 did. There were so many crashes and so much lagging I couldn't have fun.;Wonderful
384;275.0;5.0;9.0;FIRST OFF... I have played Sims through when they first were made and just got Sims 4.. I have played SIms 3 a lot! Yes there are some things Sims 4 is lacking but the other stuff completely makes up for that. Better graphics, multitasking, better emotions, better outfits, hairstyles, better ways to create a SIM. I think all the negative reviews are honestly because people just expected way too much from the game and if you go look at the SIMS 3 reviews they are horrible too.. Really I was scared to buy the game because of all the negative reviews but I ended up loving it and didn't see anything negative about it really except for the smaller towns(That was the only thing I would have fixed). Anyways... Sims 4 is a wonderful game for those who like playing SIMS and I don't think it is a waste of money at all. WAY WAY faster. Some glitches but it's a big game so little glitches here and there are expected. Step up from SIMS 3 for sure!;Good purchase!
397;276.0;5.0;9.0;I like it.  It's a base game with more to come. I was getting board with TS3.  Nice change.;I like it.
21;277.0;3.0;6.0;I read the reviews. I wanted to know if it ran on Windows 10 and it was difficult to find an answer. It does, I have it running. I never had Sims 3, so I don't have that to compare it to. I did have Sims 2 (I didn't think that would run on Win 10 because of it's age, It might.), besides the visual difference I think the games are very similar. Yes there are differences, but the feel of the game is much the same.\nMy biggest problem with the game, and I see it as a big one, (I thought about only giving two stars), is Origin. I ordered the disks, I expected it to load from the disks. It did not. When I tried to load it, it brings up Origin (this is where you download the game, it's extensions, bonus packs, etc. from, plus other games Origins wants to sell you) and starts downloading at a pace that was close to 18 hours of downloading. After a number of tries to find a path to not download from Origins, I went online looking for answers and to find out how to get it to load it from the disks. There are a lot of help sites and a lot of ideas as to how to do this. The Electronic Arts site was not much help. After trying a number of the approaches I was finding online, I did manage to get it to download from Origins in about 3 hours. None of the 'tricks' I was trying worked exactly as they laid them out. Possibly the difference between win 10 and what ever win version they had used. So, after buying the disks to load from, I spent about 12 hours trying to find out how and 3 hours downloading from Origins.\nWhen you go to play the game, double clicking on the Sims icon, Origins password screen comes up first, and you sign in, then after a brief pause the game starts. So far I have had wyfy when playing, but I suspect that without wyfy you cannot access the game. When you exit the game, Origin is still running and you have to close it independently. I see no purpose to Origin, that's why I have Amazon, but that's just me. Had I known that I was going to have all the difficulties I did in getting the game to run and was going to have to run thru Origin, I would have skipped it. I'm not overly impressed with the game (beyond it's similarity to Sims2), and when I look at the expansion packs I don't see myself going there, I don't see them adding that much to the game but maybe that's just me. I'm disappointed in Electronic Arts and their lack of support in the Win 10 / Origin issues.;Avoid This Game Unless You Want An Origin Account
66;278.0;1.0;8.0;"**NOT usable with a Laptop for Camera Controls** - Laptop Unfriendly - I cannot tilt the camera with the sims 4 unlike how I can with the sims 3, so I cannot look around easily. Also, moving objects in build/buy mode (of which there are very very few objects available compared to sims 3) is difficult. I can only see 1 view as a result. They expect you to have a desktop computer with a mouse. It even shows in the buy objects, which only has one laptop available (unlike sims 3 which is laptop friendly and many laptops available to purchase in buy mode) and is not as useful as the desktop computers in-game (cannot program, ect). I only have laptops and they are the future, yet unusable for sims 4. I can still use sims 3, however.\n\nBuy Sims 3 (with is great expansions and stuff packs) instead of Sims 4.\n\nThis should have stayed an Online Game. Is this even the same series as Sims 3? Sims 4 seems like a knock-off of the entire Sims series. It's as if 2 different people and companies made the Sims 3 and the Sims 4, as it feels like an entirely different game.\n\n I can see why people are saying Sims 4 is ""the end"" of the Sim series. It makes Sims 3 seem ""epic"" and ""end-game"" while Sims 4 is a comedic spin-off of the series and making fun of it. I did laugh more often playing the Sims 4, because it is more cartoony (looks like barbie and reminds me of early 2000's chicken little and Disney characters), the sim's walk styles which are highly unrealistic, and the way they go about the small neighborhood area talking and communicating. Expect to go to a bar (of which there are NO restaurants available - and you can only order chips?!) or library and see the sims talking 24/7 the entire time to sims with their backs turned ACROSS the entire room. This makes no sense. Also, the supposed ""emotions"" sims have don't really work and replace the ""thought-bubbles"" that sims 3 (and I think sims 2 - which I barely played, I'm more of a sims 3 fan) had. Sims no longer have thoughts, apparently and you can no longer see the thoughts of non-active sims, either. Their ""chats"" seem boring and I seem to have no idea what they are talking about or thinking about (no thoughts?!), aside from chosing social controls (I can see why this was originally an Online Game - the small areas to travel to, the loading screens, and the emphasis in the game on social interaction vs career progression and skilling up, all says it was supposed to be an online social game like, as funny as it sounds, club penguin - this Sims 4 is clearly aimed toward new, younger players than previous sims series games, especially the ""epic"" Sims 3, who have never played them, therefore, don't know anything better). ALL they do is Chat! They will revert from the ""original"" social interactions you choose back to just plain old ""chatting"" (of which you have no idea what the subject is unlike prev games), which doesn't show their unique personalities.\n\nFurther, Sims now can only have 3 traits. You thought 5 wasn't many traits (or 6 with University, which I thought was decent). Now they are even MORE simple and plastic characters. Also Create-A-Sim is basically un-workable with a laptop. I cannot ""click and drag"" the bodies as I could use the sliders to change the sims in Sims 3. Also, there are far fewer choices for clothing. So, those ""perks"" they claimed in the trailers are gone. The sims look more un-realistic than ever. I cannot ""make"" a sim which looks like my neighbor or friend?! I cannot even use the ""click and drag"" on my laptop because I have no mouse. Also, I made the same traits that one of the sims 3 characters has (my favorite sim), with the typical ""Good, Ambitious, Genius"" traits, but the traits don't really play-out on the Sims 4 as the Sims 3. I click on the mailbox, and there's no way to ""donate"" (as ""good"" sims can do), also, unlike in Sims 3, the ""good"" sims can have mean social choices when angry, which in Sims 3, they would never autonomously do ""mean"" interactions or have wishes for them. ALL the sims, therefore, will nearly have the same social reactions based on their bland 5-emotion options with little variety, because their is less emphasis on traits. However, in the Sims 3, I thought they had more emotions, thoughts, and individuality. They were like real people (in comparision) than controlled-bots which I feel Sims 4 is. They even say ""a well-cared for sim is a happy sim"" when the needs are high, as if they cannot do anything on their own without the player and are ""pets"", which in Sims 3, the Sims could go about their lives without any players (with Story Progression, e.g. and personalities), choosing jobs and such, but obviously often wouldn't get promotions or be as successful as with a player. In Sims 3, the sims would react to their moods as well, but more so than in Sims 4. Also, I could see close-up how they were feeling in Sims 3, while in Sims 4, close up they look as if they are in a ""zen-bland"" mood which is contrary to the little icon on the button which claims they are in a particular mood. In Sims 3, they would show if they were angry, uncomfortable, or happy. In the Sims 4, they don't show it except for looking at the ""social interaction"" icon at the top or the icon at the lower left. The ""emotions"" perk they claim in the trailer also falls flat, because they appear they have even fewer moods than in Sims 3! Aside from the little icon. Also, ""Life Wishes"" have been replaced by Aspirations, which can be changed unlike Sims 3, where they were a part of their unique personalities. Life-Wishes/Aspirations are also Less Career-based than before (less emphasis on careers and skilling up), with little connection (if any) to any chosen careers except for ""want to be rich"" or a creative writer. The other aspirations are useless for careers. Also, there are far fewer items, as previously said, to buy, and that includes items made to improve skills. There are no longer telescopes (replaced by a single microscope), and most other unique items for skills except for painting or music or athletics. It's Very limited. Also, the descriptions for the few items are not very interesting or funny (in my opinion) as sims 3. There's very little ""lore"" or ""storyline"" in Sims 4, if any? I also bought a better bed for the sim, rather than the cheapest to get rid of the ""bad bed"" moodlet, but they still would get it anyways, even though the description claimed it wasn't uncomfortable. Items don't seem to work as they claim.\n\n The Open World, Story Progression, items to buy, realistic careers (gone are military, medical field, politics, business, and law enforcement - as if ""special agent"" could replace that), are not available in Sims 4, which is a downgrade from Sims 3. It is fine for ""creative"" sims, but there are really, few other options. There seems to be NO storyline to the neighborhoods or sims, which I cannot choose upon playing?, unlike the previous Sims games. As far as I could tell, when looking at households to ""travel"" to, I did not see any descriptions for the sims living there or any information. Upon starting the game, it prompted me to immediately ""create-a-sim"" and not let me few the families (there are very, VERY few sims in Sims 4) before playing. The world is incredibly smaller, and less layered. There are few options to do much of anything. There were Plenty of sims in Sims 3, and I could, at least, visit a Bistro or other restaurant or even grill. There's no where to eat-out in Sims 4, so your times ""out of the house"" are extremely limited. I also cannot (since there's no Open World) take classes in Skills. There are no cars (as previously stated by reviewers), but there are not even taxis, either. The sim ""travels"" (I could only find the option on the cell phone) by going to the side of the lot and then disappearing. That's highly unrealistic and seems like a different game, as said. You also cannot select as many items as Sims 3, and there are fewer interactions with objects available. You may see places on the screen, but they're unselectable and you're limited to your small little area, like a pet pen (since sims are more like ""pets"" to players than before (where they at least had storylines/lore and personalities)!).\n\nThe social relationships seem unrealistic. My sim (who got ""tense"" after just 3 Days without a promotion, which didn't happen with my Sims 3 ambitious sim), got into an argument with Nina Caliente on the street while also talking to Travis (Travis appeared to not notice they were disagreeing, and this happened despite her being in a ""good"" mood), and later on, went into my sim's house and took out the trash (you'll notice random stranger sims, after being greeted, often walking inside your sim's house to take out the trash - ugh, thanks??? Makes no sense, and how do they know when they're outside before going inside to do it?) (as I said, this sims seems like a Comical ""spoof"" of the sims series). Who goes inside a persons house (who they also don't know) and take out their trash? Nina Caliente then, with a 1/4 ""relationship meter"" in the red (which she appeared to not notice), insults, and so on, then went and played on the computer for hours. She then left and claimed ""thanks for hanging out for me"" with the red relationship meter, insults, and no friendly social interaction from my sim. Social ""meters"" seem to have no relevance in the Sims 4. In the Sims 3, if a sim got into an argument with another sim, and their relationship became ""red"" they would show it. They would leave. They would not take out the other sim's trash, play on the computer, and then say they had a great time. This makes social ""relationships"" (although this Sims emphasized that it seems) rather useless and without a story-line.\n\n(Sims talk in ""groups"" very, VERY often in Sims 4, and cannot get them to stop blandly ""chatting"" (instead of unique social interactions based on their non-existent personalities.. You'll notice people standing around with books and crowding chess games, which is a little bothersome because then the sim doesn't focus on the skill and it's unrealistic to have a crowd appear out-of-nowhere, although it seems skills ""lvl"" up faster as compensation for that). It's entertaining at first to see crowded areas, but it becomes passe quickly. They don't do anything unique.\n\nWhen the game finally crashed after a few hours or so, I wasn't frustrated at all, as I would with Sims 3 since Sims 3 was more complex and interesting. Unlike with Sims 3 which would often freeze or show lag before crashing, there was no warning with Sims 4, so I had no save. I wasn't peeved, though, because I hardly did anything and since the characters are not unique, with no personalities, I had no connection to the character I created. I cared in Sims 3! I won't be played anymore, and don't look forward to the expansions. If you want a great game, which is ""epic"" and more creative, play the Sims 3! It's like the ""adult"" to this satire child called the Sims 4 and as others have said, appears to be the end of the ""great times"" of the sims series. EA has done this with Simcity. Apparently, 10 years is the ""mark"" for the end of game series and then it goes downhill from there. Can EA not go longer than 10 years with a game series before it goes downhill, and becomes less complex and interesting? The modders and others had many, many ideas for improving the Sims 3, increasing its complexity and depth, and the previous games, yet, they have gone in a completely different direction and feels like a comedic knock-off of the sims, but still with the same name.";"Comical Satire of the ""Sims"" Series"
34;279.0;4.0;7.0;"I purchased this via the Origin store, so I will not be seen as a verified customer.\n\nFirst, I am writing this review because I think it's time for a good portion of the hate to stop.\n\nThere is a lot of hate for this game. Day one release... this may have been justified. But I will complain about one thing before reviewing: there is this hedonistic tendency for reviewers to stamp themselves with a pedigree of sorts, as sim fans forever, therefore they're the best to review a game. (You know, when people say: ""I've been a fan for over ten years... since Sims 1, blah, blah, blah""). This is such a typical problem within gaming. Call of Duty, Fallout, The Elder Scrolls all have their fanboys/girls who come out of the woodworks to state how awesome the previous game was and how the new one is not as great as the old one. I will try to not be that one.\n\nIs there any truth to the complaints in Sims 4? Sure, there is some truth. A lot of it is blown out of proportion, but there is some truth in there. When Sims 3 came out, a lot of people were happy to overlook the steps backwards from Sims 2 because of the new features of Create a sim and an open world. There were definite steps backwards. There are more animations in Sims 2 than in Sims 3 and Sims 4, even though Sims 2 is much older. Sims 2 was much more of a precise real life simulator in many ways. Sims 3 added open world at the cost of pathing issues, reduced animations (that would seriously hog any system in an open world) etc. Sims 4 didn't have a lot at the start, and felt half baked. They've rectified a lot of that.\n\nThe biggest complaint against Sims 4 is that it isn't open world. And obviously that is a step back, right? I'm not so sure. Sims 3 was such a poor performer. You could have an awesome gaming rig, and still not run it smoothly, especially late in a gameplay. You added in all that awesome CAS stuff you downloaded from TSR and MTS (custom content sites, to name a few prominent ones) and that game bogged down. Looked so cool, but bogged down. Although it seemed great in theory, in actuality, you had to be careful what stuff you added to the CAS and open world, or it would bog down considerably, not to mention custom content. I remember my gardener having a ton of fruit and veggies in his pocket and that dropped my frame rate from 60 to 10... seriously? stuff in my pocket drops a frame rate?\n\nIn Sims 4, although it is not open world, it feels very open to me. You plant your house on a street, and soon you will have multiple sims walking up and down your street. Some walking, others jogging, some slouching off to work and many meeting up exchanging greetings. Your sims will even see some of these sims and meander out to greet them. It feels quite natural. In fact much of Sims 4 feels quite natural. Their mood swings, the way they do stuff, the multitasking... it all feels much more fluid than previous sim games. The complaint here comes from those who absolutely must control everything in their sims life. I have played that way before, because you almost had to in Sims 3 and Sims 2 or bad things would happen! But in Sims 4 it just feels like a part of their day.\n\n""But there's no open world, gosh darn it; you won't convince me it's good until they change that!!!"" I know, but hit the gym from the world map and you transport there via a really short load screen. A menu pops up to invite known sims to come with you. You can bring a party with you! At the gym are a good number of sims exercising, catching up, walking in on someone else's shower. This boredom that other reviewers are talking about... what are you on about? Sims 3 wasn't any different. You'd go to the park. You'd practically teleport there in your car that went a million miles an hour. A handful of sims would be there in Sims 3, whereas in Sims 4 there are a lot of sims hanging around. Some inside, other walking down the street on their way somewhere. In Sims 3, you'd talk to the ten people there... then they'd leave and ""teleport"" into their car and magically disappear somewhere.\n\nGone are the pathing issues of Sims 3 and before. Sims 4, there is hardly a hiccup with pathing (pathing is the computer giving a route for the sim to get from here to there.). I remember my sim peeing themselves in Sims 3 because they couldn't make it to the bathroom at a party. Every time another sim got in their way, my sim would lose their path. How many times I had a large household in Sims 3 where the one guy I thought was on his way home to sleep before work, was still at the park, because he couldn't find his path home. Sims 4 excels here. Some naysayers will report sims moving ""through"" each other in order to find their path. I've seen that happen only once or twice in about 100 hours of gametime, big whippitydo.\n\nAnother complaint is that there isn't a lot to do in the base game of Sims 4. This is very true. Wasn't much different in Sims 3 and the others. I remember really getting into Sims 3 when Ambitions came out. World Adventures was a great vacation to break the monotony of going to ""rabbit holes"" all day. Truth be told, Sims 3 was worse as a base game. It had open world, and CAS, and... rabbit holes... and granny clothes to dress your sim in. Oh, there were some ugly cars, but honestly, everyone just downloaded Fresh Prince's awesome cars. There wasn't any more to do in Sims 3 than in Sims 4. ""Cough, toddlers, cough cough.""(says the naysayer) Yeah, whatever. Sims 4 has a much better handle on enjoying childhood and teenage life. Do you really, absolutely need a stage of life that lasts for just a year in real life? I don't miss toddlers one bit. In fact the way childhood and teenage life is handled, I actually want to have a digital family more than in Sims 3.\n\nDoes Sims 4 have any other features that stand way above other titles? Absolutely. Build mode is fantastic. What you can do with a house is so much more than in Sims 3. I built extensively in Sims 3, and have enjoyed my builds in Sims 4. I'm not too shabby either (coolhandlukeboy2 in the gallery). You can really create amazing stuff in Sims 4 and it is waaaaay easier to do so than in Sims 3. Extend a room on the fly. Build a basement without having to redo the whole house (Sims 3 I'm looking at you). You can pick up a house, or pick up a lot and move it. And the roofs are so much better than Sims 3... so much better... so much better.\n\nThe gallery is an amazing feature that actually works well. It works so well there are tons of stuff on there that shouldn't be (some ugly stuff out there... just saying). You can find a house so easily, and plop it down in your own world within seconds. The gallery alone is something people overlook about Sims 4. It is such an amazing feature.\n\nAnother major highlight is how Sims 4 allows a seamless transition between worlds. Without mods, Sims 3 made you stick to a world, unless you had World Adventures or that space expansion that really was not my cup of tea. That's right, in Sims 4 you can go to the gym in your main world, or go to the gym in Windenburg (town from Get Together xpac), Magnolia Promenade, Desert place or Newcrest. And as the game builds... you'll have more worlds you can seamlessly transition to and from. It's such a nice feature. Tired of the desert place? Take a spa day in Magnolia Promenade. Tired of Windenburg? Travel to Willow Creek. Want to build your own town? Visit the gallery, plop down Victorian houses into Newcrest and in moments you have a new city customized to your heart's content.\n\n""But the town is so small, and there's only a handful of shops to go to!"" Then you've failed to realize that the game extends past the world you chose to live in. In Sims 3, you chose to live in Appalosia Plains, and you were stuck there for the rest of the game. It darn well better be good. In Sims 4, like mentioned in my paragraph above, you are not tied to your world. You can go to any other world currently available. As this game grows, it will be huge. Sims from those other worlds will walk by your house. In Sims 3... no one walked by my house. People drove past my house at a million miles an hour in their car, but very few people ever walked by. I think many reviewers are being quite unfair. It seems they are comparing a finished Sims 3 with 11 expansion packs. Indeed, most of the things ""absent"" from Sims 4 base game were just as absent from Sims 3's base game. Most of the ""lacking"" content is stuff that will be added by expansions because they were almost always added by expansion in Sims games.\n\nI can also leave my sim alone and enjoy looking at other sims interact and do stuff. Unlike prior titles, they do quite fine on their own. When you go to a different location with a household of more than one, you can leave your other sims behind. They do quite well on satisfying their needs and even prepping for work. You can enjoy your sim being out and about without worrying whether the other sims are dying on you.\n\nUpdates. Updates are much cheaper than Sims 3. Stuff packs contain amazing clothes and items for only ten bucks. You get way more bang for your buck in Sims 4. About 50% more. Only problem is--at the time of this writing--most of the stuff packs are really spread out in terms of what you get. The Movie pack gets you about 3 movie items and the rest is boho stuff. What in the world? I mean, the boho clothes looks amazing (I'm not really even into boho), but why is that together? Game packs are awesome value.\n\nSo, what are my pros and cons?\n\nPros:\n- Build mode is fantastic\n- Sims act more natural and less robotic\n- All worlds are interconnected for a very broad feel to the gameplay\n- Gallery is a great addition and done so very well\n- Sims are more autonomous and less needy\n- Will play on pretty much any computer out there... unlike Sims 3\n- Emotions adds a fun mechanic that makes sims look more interesting. Can also make it tedious if you are a min/max person\n\nCons:\n- Game is solid, but lacking as a base game\n- Default camera is almost there, but there's no tilt up and down? (you can revert to Sims 3 camera, but I hated that camera)\n- Playing sims can be too easy. Really easy to get money and max your skills, compared to previous sims\n- Cartoony look doesn't gel with some, I dig it\n- I know why they killed CAS, but having just a handful of colors to choose from is a bad compromise\n- No cars at all (I guess there's little need to animate them, but it would make more sense that we have to own them before going from world to world)\n- Same complaint as Sims 3... your curtain selection just stinks... really stinks...\n- Not a lot of furniture items, even with all the paid updates (written just after Movie Stuff Pack)";Why the game is good but not perfect

86;282.0;2.0;8.0;As an avid simmer (I've been playing and obsessed since the original Sims came out over 10 years ago), the Sims 4 is a HUGE disappointment. Notice the all capital HUGE. It's pretty much the original Sims and Sims 2 put together. The gameplay has changed significantly! Here's a good list of things missed http://ts4news.com/post/94541924952/82-features-missing-from-the-sims-4\nI was under the impression, that the Sims 4 would be an upgrade from Sims 3, but it's absolutely a downgrade and then some. I would much rather just play the Sims 3. I would say the only good things are Create a Sim (getting to modify every part of their body) and build mode has some interesting new features, but that is it. The emotions, I just don't get and seems like a huge waste. It's harder to get promotions in work and more complicated tasks. There is not enough to do like in the Sims 3. You can't even watch your sims get into a car to go to work/school (they simply disappear), they can no longer drive or own cars and the places to go suck. It's just a bar/lounge, the gym and a library. There isn't a toddler stage anymore and you can't see what infants needs are, there are no dishwashers or babysitters. It seems to be ruled by making lots of friends and being really social, which is extremely hard to do when there are hardly any places to go. It's just bad. They easily could have made an expansion for the Sims 3 with all the things the Sims 4 offers and it would've been much better. If you're into the building and creating sims, then you might enjoy the difference, but if you play for the actual sims and giving them a life to live, it's terrible. Do not waste your money!;"Regular Simmers; you will hate this!"
45;283.0;2.0;7.0;I used to really enjoy this game. I've always enjoyed Sims and my boyfriend bought this version for me in January. But now that I've upgraded to Windows 10, it doesn't work and it isn't compatible. Such a bummer and waste of money.;DON'T BUY WITH WINDOWS 10!
88;284.0;1.0;8.0;This game is unbelievably tedious and boring. What I enjoyed most about Sims 3 was being creative and having the lifelike scenes and decorating to do. This game is absolutely stripped down, absurdly minimalistic, offering almost no variety of choice and customization. I had planned to do a video review of the game and I recorded 30 minutes and realized the game was so boring, the review would also bore people to death. Sims 3 was an epic experience. How Sims 4 has been scoring even 3 stars on average is beyond me. 2 stars would have been generous.;Stunningly Boring.
89;285.0;1.0;8.0;I'm trying to like this game. I really am. They are offering it for free on Origin for two days. You can try it out there if you want and form your own opinion.\nI do like how easy it is to make Sims, they look better but the choices in terms of colours and hairstyles are limited. but, you can make green and blue Sims. There's more tattoos, so that is good. You can choose things like walking styles. They combine the aspiration system from 2 with the traits system from 3. You can only pick three traits and they are very limited.\n\nThe game runs smoother and faster than Sims 3 and it takes a lot less long to load, but this is where the good things end. They end when you actually play the game.\n\nThe graphics compared to Sims 3 are muddy. Look at a tree from Sims 3 vs. one from Sims 4. What's the point of having better looking Sims if the graphics are going to be so terrible? The  trees look like blobs drawn by children! With 3 there were beautiful landscapes that a lot of effort was put into. You can see water rippling, breezes moving leaves. Animals crawling around. It's so much better done.\n\nThe graphics on 2 were better than these! The neighbourhood seems small and claustrophobic. You can't send your Sims off to the bookstore to buy some books and meet people along the way. I haven't sent my Sims to town yet because I can't figure out how. They go off to work and you have no control over how they work like with 3.\n\nI'm sorry, but 3 is a better game. At least if you buy Sims 3 and several expansion packs it will cost around the same you'd pay for this incomplete game. It still has dozens of bugs, freezes and lurches like crazy but you get horses, vampires, weather, ghost babies, and there's so much more to do than in 4. Plus 3 has more jobs and careers. I know this is the base game and they're supposed to be very basic, but there's no excuse to be THIS basic. Sims 2 was a huge improvement over 1. It was buggy, but you got genetics, children didn't just sprout from babies to children. There were aspirations. The graphics were improved. I didn't like Sims 3 initially but with more expansion packs it did get better, but the bugs decreased my enjoyment.\n\nWhat EA should have done was improved 3, get rid of the bugs, stop the constant freezing, fix the stupid glitches and THEN combine the best stuff from 2 and 3 that everyone loves and enjoys and put that in Sims 4 with improvements.\n\nBut instead they give you a fraction of the content and expect you to pay more for it? Sorry. This is not going to happen. I won't be buying this until the price goes down and they make it better! Maybe I won't even consider it until Sims 5 comes out and the base game and expansions cost less. Or not. I'll just suffer through the bugs and freezing of 3 because at least I have unicorns in that game.;EA, listen to your fans.
47;286.0;5.0;7.0;According to my daughter you should get this game.  You get to create a virtual world and characters who have their own personality, both nice and not so nice.  You can make the characters look like you or your friends or even your dream date.  You also can be creative by building houses and towns for them.;Everybody needs this game.
109;287.0;2.0;8.0;"I refuse to give this game 1 star because the graphics and new emotions are great--and I absolutely love the CAS.\n\nI was very, very excited about this game when it first came out, I downloaded the trial through Origin and thought that the create-a-sim (CAS) was amazing in comparison to it's predecessors. It was an absolute let down when I actually got to play the full game. The game feels strikingly similar to their FreePlay game on social media, and that feeling makes me a little sick.\n\nFor a game that is rumored to end the series (if they can't get it right), I'm very disappointed that this was the hand Maxis played. I can't say that the articles about the end of the Sims franchise are 100% true, because I feel like the Sims 3 was an amazing game and I'm not sure what there was to ""get right"" other than to just update the game to new graphics, improve upon features, etc. But if they were basing the future of this series off of this game, well--I'm not exactly sure it's a bad idea to pull the plug (the steps taken backwards are embarrassing).\n\nThe items in the game are scarce, which I expected with a vanilla game without any expansions, but this takes it to a totally new level. The item selection is pathetic. In addition, the fact that you can't customize the colors of items anymore (a feature previously in the Sims 3) is a total bust. You have your given colors that you can pick from and that's it. Very disappointing.\n\nThe lack of an open world is also very, VERY disappointing. Actually, this is the real deal-breaker for me. Everything else can be improved upon with an expansion, except this. After being revolutionary in the Sims 3 with an open world with NO loading screens, you go to this. This feels very Sims 2 to me, and there's a reason I don't play the Sims 2 anymore (slllllooooowwwww lllllooooadddddiinnngg tiiimmmeesssss). While this game loads faster than the Sims 2, there is no rhyme or reason to why you would revert back after making an open-world game.\n\nIn addition to the world NOT being open, there is minimal residential lots, and that's a bummer. And, because of the missing open world ability, I feel like there is no point to this game. The world feels small and it makes it easy to keep characters inside of their own little world on their own lots. At least with careers there was somewhere Sims could drive in the Sims 3, giving you a REASON to leave your lot, but that was also taken away and we're forced with the old sims/sims 2 style of getting in a car that takes your sims nowhere. The gameplay is boring and lacks variety like it used to be in the Sims 3, the Sims 3 gave the game purpose, this is just a sorry excuse of purpose and makes me feel like life itself has no meaning (cause my life is monotonous and boring, why do I want to play a game that will remind me of that?).\n\nThe careers in the game have been trimmed down, in a bad way. There are no careers that you can partake in with your Sim (such as the Ghosthunter career that came out with a Sims 3 expansion). The hobby careers like writing are unfulfilling. I can't tell you about anything else career related because I honestly game up on this aspect of the game after a while.\n\nSim personalities and motives are good. I feel like the personalities are a nice touch, and the motifs seem to deteriorate faster, which gives you some challenge when playing (its more realistic in my opinion). Character interactions feel limited to me, but that could be changed with expansion packs (there isn't a lot for sims to say to each other).\n\nThe game has lost purpose and direction, and that disappoints me as an avid Sims fan. I'm just going to go back to playing the Sims 3. I recommend the guys at Maxis play it once in a while--maybe learn something. Cause anyone who says that they'd rather play the Sims 4 are trying to sell it to you.";"""One step forward, ten years back""? Agreed."
114;288.0;1.0;8.0;"I have been playing The sims since ""The Sims"". I can't even begin to express how disappointed I am in EA and in sims 4. There is not open map what so ever. Anytime you want to go anywhere, which is very limited anyways, there is a loading screen like in sims 2. If you have the sims 3 then stick with it because this is such a downgrade it's unbelievable! There is no point to this game. All they were worried about were graphics and emotions and create-a-sim which is fantastic but they didn't put any thought into actual game play. I cannot stand playing this game. It is so boring and I'm very disappointed I didn't trust other people's reviews.";Don't waste your money.
117;289.0;4.0;8.0;Unlike most here who have seemed to not have taken their time to play the game and then write a review I have. Of course you are going to have your negatives when you hear about certain features are missing. Yes, toddlers are missing but a lot of features have been restored such as pools and ghosts. Soon certain services such as repairmen will be back as well. From the begining I was very impressed by the emotions and the theme of the game. I'm enjoying the cartoon aspect of the game as well. Sims is a parody of life so what better use of a game than to make it cartoon styled. It just seems to flow nicely and I'm a fan.\n\nCan we please talk about the multitasking for just a minute? Okay! So the multitasking is wonderful and so efficient! I love the fact that they emphasize on it so much. Your sim can have a conversation with another sim while multitasking easily without even needing to command them to chat. It looks much more natural now than it ever did. I can sit back for the most part and just watch them as they do their thing.\n\nThe variety of food and books are spectacular! I know it's such a small feature but I really enjoy those two things. I'm not so impressed by the house paint. I really wish the exterior of house paints had more variety also not a fan of the automatic siding of the corners of the walls on the exterior. Its just awkward to me and sometimes I don't want that. Also I feel that the windows are too big and awkward for the walls to me.\n\nI feel the graphics are wonderful and I'm very happy with it. Also I'm happy open world is gone. I'm sorry for those who miss it but it really became an issue for me when I played the sims 3. The bugging was non-stop and my laptop was efficient enough believe me. This game is wonderful when it comes to being bug free. I only had one incident where I froze and it was only for like two seconds before the game corrected itself.\n\nThe gameplay is just as wonderful. Yes there is a bit of a lack for content but what sims base game didn't at first? They all do. There are no expansions so yeah expect lack of content. I love the create a sim although I miss the create a style. I feel like they could have at least bring that back because I do miss picking my own colors at least but I guess I accept it. The Sims team has shown that they are slowly but surely correcting their errors. I feel sooner or later I feel they will have a wonderful game full of brilliant content that everyone who has been so against it will find a way to enjoy it.;Huge potential and definitely not a step back...
118;290.0;5.0;8.0;For me, this game is a huge improvement. It's more realistic, makes more sense, and spends less time on nonsense and more time on the actual game.\nThe changes in sim interactions are what I like most. Multitasking is now a thing. Your sim can be eating, reading, typing, or whatever and you can still choose interactions with other sims (your task will proceed more slowly). If you're in a conversation with another sim, the sims will continue to chat by default without you choosing an interaction. They don't just stand there until they get bored and walk away. There is also less interference between sims when they are, for example, trying to pick up plates of food. These changes seem small but they make a big difference in the overall feel of the game. Your sim can get a lot more done in a day, and it's easier to control many sims at once.\nMaybe it's because I started with low expectations because of all the reviews, but there honestly isn't anything I don't like about it. I thought not having an open world would bother me but it doesn't.;The changes in sim interactions are what I like most. Multitasking is now a thing
124;291.0;2.0;8.0;Let me start by saying I have always, ALWAYS been a hardcore Sims fan. I remember being young and poking around with the boxy, pixelated sims from Sims 1, being amazed by the new dynamics in Sims 2, and then being absolutely blown away by just how amazing Sims 3 was, so I think it's safe to say I was extremely excited about this game. I'd watched some reviews, read some, but decided to form my own opinion, and now I wish that I had listened to everyone.\n\nLet me start by saying this game isn't necessarily BAD. If you liked the Sims circa Sims 2 era, you'll really enjoy this. A lot of the same features are back, most notably the loading screen in between different areas, the focus on the Sims themselves vs what's going on around them, etc. The game is alright enough to keep you entertained for a while, but it didn't feel like a Sims game at all. I don't know if it's unfair for me to say it felt a bit like a cheap knock off of the Sims 2 with slightly better graphics and more interactions with your sims, but it does. A lot of the things that the Sims 3 worked so hard to build up are just missing and it feels like a half-finished game. I know EA wants their money, but I honestly think this game did more harm to the Sims franchise than good. They wanted to try and reach out to a broader audience (hence the 32 bit aspect of the game which is one of the reasons things like open world, different cities, etc. are missing), but if anything, all they did was cripple a good product.\n\nHonestly, if you're like me and you don't want to let your decision be swayed by reviews, I really suggest just buying it and see for yourself. Just know that this game is NOT a continuation of the Sims 3 despite the number on the end. I don't know exactly what to consider it--it probably would have worked far better as a stand-alone game--but if that's what you're expecting, I can promise you you will be disappointed.;Disappointment
128;292.0;1.0;8.0;Please just burn in H*LL EA, everything you touch dies.;One Star
139;293.0;2.0;8.0;Let's start by saying I have been playing this game since the very beginning. I spent all my money as a kid buying every expansion known to man. It's funny thinking back on how much time of my life I have spent playing this game. With that being said, there are no words to how disappointed and angry I am with this game. I thought this would take us to the next step like sims 3 did from sims 2. That I was impressed with and loved all the way up until this new game came out. This Sims 4 game is complete trash and I wish I could get my money back (I cannot believe I am even writing such words about my favorite game in the whole world, but it's true!). There are so many things I cannot stand about this game. Without even saying much about BABIES/TODDLERS!!, I can say there are so many things missing from this base game that makes me think electronic arts is getting greedy.\n\n1. I cannot stand how the neighborhoods have been created and cannot believe we are going back to a closed type neighborhood after having so much freedom in the sims 3. Even though you couldn't go into their work, I still enjoyed just GOING to their workplace. Now they walk off the sidewalk and are gone. Businesses, don't think about going there. You have a baby, no hospital visit. The sim is just gone and then back with a bassinet in place.\n\n2. What the heck is really new in this game!? If people are asking this, there is a problem. With a whole new game there such be too many new things to list them all, not ask what really is new? I personally hate the new create-a-sim and cannot get any sims to look the way I want. Which leads me into number 3...\n\n3. The clothes are horrible in the base game. There are not a lot of options, actually sims 1 had more options than this game. Very disappointing.\n\nI could go on and on all day about my disappointment. EA, you just lost another faithful fan that has been with you since the beginning. Stop making us pay for things that SHOULD come with the base game. I'm tired of having to buy all this extra nonsense in the store. Do the right thing and include these new things in the base game/expansions. I highly doubt I'll be buying another sims game again and since September I barely play this game. I get more enjoyment from playing sims 3 like I have been doing the past few years.;Nothing, but disappointment.
164;294.0;1.0;8.0;This is my first one star rating on a product ever.  This game is horrible compared to the depth that Sims 3 had, if you loved Sims 3, you'll probably hate this game.  They completely removed create-a-style and confirmed it won't be in the game, prolly ever, cause it needs to be part of base game...this was one of the greatest features of Sims 3. The game is absolutely a lame duck, a turd, and I'm extremely disappointed in giving EA false confidence by having purchased this disgrace to the Sims lineup. Please read reviews carefully before purchasing this game, it's like a prettier version of their android game, not an Upgrade of the Sims 3.  Booo MAxis and Booo EA what a Giant POS!;This game is horrible compared to the depth that Sims 3 had
52;295.0;2.0;7.0;I waited a year after purchasing this game in order to give the developers and EA time to work with the game and see what they could improve upon, but here we are almost a year after I brought the game and still not much improvement. The base game is enjoyable for a bit, but that fades quickly if you've ever played the sims 3 or the sims 2. Given the long list of game limitations such as: lack of an open world (only one lot and a small neighborhood common area loaded a time), restriction of babies to mere objects attached to cribs, lack of a toddler life stage, sims teleporting to different lots instead of actually walking/driving to the edge of the screen, lack of traditional careers, focus on cartoon cupcake makers and telescopes instead of real telescopes like in previous games, and lack of terrain editing tools, this game just breaks the level of immersion that the previous titles had for players. Every time you get caught into the game play, it's broken by either a loading screen, or a cartoon depiction of something that should have been lifelike.\n\nNow, the game isn't without it's improvements. The multitasking system is awesome and allows for sims to take better advantage of their time, the new CAS and sims graphics allows you to create more life-like sims once you get the hang of it, and the new build/buy mode also shows some improvements in easier house making. But overall, for long-time players of The Sims series, this game will likely come as a disappointment to you. I have reverting back to playing the Sims 3 now.\n\nEA has released several updates and patches over the past year to add things like pools (but the diving board is still MIA), and stuff packs, game packs, and expansion packs, but none have significantly changed the underlying problems with this game. I believe a better title for this release would be The Sims 1.5. It is a game that could have been built 10 years ago, and probably runs fine on computers made 10 years ago. In conclusion, I recommend waiting to see if they can fix some of the issues with the game, or wait it out until The Sims 5 (if that even happens)...don't waste your money here.;Welcome to The Sims 1.5
166;296.0;1.0;8.0;Horrible graphics, no toddlers, pools, and doesn't have any intent of creating a mac platform.\n\nHATE IT.;FAIL & FACEPALM
167;297.0;2.0;8.0;"I have to admit, I was tentative this morning when I downloaded this from origin. The only thing that made me okay with my decision was that they have a 24 hour return policy. I thought after five hours of download time, it couldn't really be as bad as everyone was saying... could it? As I booted it up and was brought to the new Create A Sim interface, I hit my first unpleasant bump. To customize your sim's face etc., you need to click and drag. This probably seems like a positive thing, but for me it was a huge inconvenience. I use a laptop, and since I usually carry it around as per intended, I don't use a mouse. When I play sims, I usually sit in bed, on the couch etc, since this is a game that I play when I'm relaxing, I don't want to have to find my mouse and mousepad and be forced to move to a flat surface whenever I want to play.\nAfter cobbling together a less than satisfactory sim using their extremely limited presets (everyone has pretty much covered how much the game is lacking in this regard, so I won't dwell on it), I started building my new sim a home. Lo and behold! More clicking and dragging in Build mode! Even more frustrating imprecision for someone who doesn't use a mouse! At one point the game tried to explain the abysmal new camera control scheme, which surprise surprise, only works with a mouse.\n I know these seem like very minor complaints. Why don't I just use a mouse and shut up about my inconvenience? And you know what? I'd be willing to do that for a good game. But everything else is just so mediocre in this game that it just cannot be saved from its horrible control scheme. It actually feels more like a HD reboot of The Sims 1 than a sequel to the Sims 3, since it has a lot of the same annoyances as the FIRST game in the series. Uninteresting children that feel more like objects than characters: check. Annoyingly limited careers with arbitrary advancement criteria (guess what folks? the friend requirement is back!): check. Annoying load screens whenever you want to go anywhere: check. Limited customization of EVERYTHING: check. Needs that deplete so quickly that you don't have enough time to do anything ""fun"" after the first day: check. The rest of the game play just seems like a shameless repackage of the sims 2 engine. There are only two new things that I have noticed in this game are 1. the ""emotions"" system, which in most cases either makes a sim disobey regardless of needs, or gives them new wishes that are either pointless or counterproductive. and 2.that all of the services that you could call when your sim started making money and didn't need to clean their own house, make their own food, etc. anymore have been removed. So all in all, not the sequel to the sims 3 that I was hoping for.";NOT a satisfying sequel to the Sims 3 and NOT laptop friendly
170;298.0;1.0;8.0;I'm going to keep this simple. There's a lack of depth in this game that makes it very difficult to immerse yourself in. The emotions help, but you're just as well off playing TS3 because they are practically advanced moodlets, and in my honest opinion, moodlets were just as fun. The only thing this game has going for it is build mode which is a huge advancement. Actual gameplay is a bore.;a disappointment

I only became a Sims fan well after Sims 3 was released and I purchased 2 exp packs (late night and into the future) when ordering the base game. I loved it and was happy there was a new one coming out....but I guess the lesson to be learned is to be late to the game and NOT pre-order because this was awful. I returned it and encourage everyone else to do so; I'd rather pay more for a total game than get the bare bones of something (other than the create a sim part) that looks like it was released 10-15yrs ago.";Later is better...
31;302.0;1.0;6.0;This game took a huge step backwards on gameplay.  When I have to go through a loading screen to go to my neighbors house then I no longer feel like my Sim is living a life. They took away all the freedom from the game and I was stuck staring at my house while my Sim was at work.  EA has lost sight of why we play this game and I will stick to Sims 3 until they turn their act around.;Not the Sims games I loved.
206;303.0;2.0;8.0;"The reviews from what others have said are true.  This game seems like a large leap back from the Sims 3.  I feel like they have made the controls more confusing than what existed in Sims 3 (it's been awhile since Sims 2 too) but, you no longer click and drag the item to get it to face the direction you want you have to use the ,(<) and . (>) keys to rotate an item.  Many are fans of the new Create a Sim, but I personally don't like it and prefer the old Sims 3 version.  I haven't figured out how to use the camera that great yet, but so far it is odd. The controls are changed around so it is hard to do something you use to do because it is no longer in the same spot.  Even the opening screen I felt was weird because it didn't go directly into the game when it went full screen; you had to hit play while in old versions full screen would go right into a menu to create or choose a family.\n\nI haven't played it that long and get bored of it quickly because of how awful it is.  In my opinion you are better off playing The Sims 3.  You will probably regret buying this if you do.";You will be better off buying Sims 3 if you don't have it.
215;304.0;5.0;8.0;Alright, people. I have spent many an hour playing the Sims 4 in the past week, and I am seriously not getting the hate.\n\nI have played the Sims since 2001, when my older cousin got bored with the original and passed it on to me. I loved it from day one. I've had each additional game, every expansion, and have spent and unholy and probably unhealthy amount of time playing the Sims.\n\nThe Sims 4 gets A LOT right. There's a learning curve-- the UI is different, the gameplay style is different-- but it's FUN. The new careers are a blast, Instead of merely leveling up skills, you have daily tasks to improve you performance. There's more skills available than ever before. The graphics are so much fun. Build A Sim is AMAZING, as is build mode.\n\nNow for the negatives. Let's keep in mind this is a newly released base game-- some problems are unavoidable. The neighborhoods are very small, and the downtown is a bit lackluster. There aren't really enough customization options for clothes, household goods, etc. It's very difficult to break up a family unit (as in, have you grown children move out). There are also some gameplay bugs, like my fiance died and I can't get married again because the game thinks I'm already engaged, and my daughters think that they're roommates instead of sisters. Have heart, Sims fans! These are minor problems that EA WILL fix!;A Learning Curve, but Still So Much Fun

243;308.0;4.0;8.0;"I've been playing the Sims since the first one came out (with no expansion packs!) in grade school. This game, for me, is an amazing step forward for the series -- even though it is lacking several key features.\n\nFor the first time, my Sims interact with each other naturally, without prompting. I was shocked the first time I took my Sim to a community lot and she entered a group conversation with 4 other Sims, getting to know each of them. I love that the one Sims can chat to another while each is doing their own activity (playing computer games, eating breakfast). It makes keeping family relationships strong incredibly easier. Additionally, within the house, Sims seek out each other for interaction. No more days going by where you've forgotten to have the husband and wife in your family chat/kiss/interact because you are so busy managing the other parts of their life --- they keep up their relationships quite well on their own. I feel like these are the most ""human"" like Sims as far as interactions and social behavior goes.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous and it runs perfectly on my computer. Each loading screen only takes a few moments.\n\nWatching a child grow up from a baby into a child was a little disconcerting after several years playing the Sims 3, but honestly, the toddler stage -- while realistic -- was more a chore than anything else. The children look lovely -- practically like miniature adults.\n\nI haven't quite found the camera option for tilting the camera to change my POV. Other than that, the UI is much more intuitive than previous iterations. The needs button, for example, will show you what need is getting low without you evening having to click on it.\n\nPros:\n -- Sims have amazing social behavior now\n -- Game looks gorgeous and runs smoothly. Loading screens only take a few seconds.\n -- UI is intuitive and puts most of what you need right at your fingertips.\n\nNegatives --\n  -- Four community lots is a little sparse. I can see what xpacks they are planning on releasing.\n  -- Family trees need to be added back in. I love looking back over my Sims' family tree and seeing how far they've come.\n  -- Quicker way to determine relationship status, especially between family members. Right now, there is no ""family"" filter for the relationship panel. It feels like family relationships (son/daughter, grandmother/grandfather) are nothing more than roomies or friends.";is an amazing step forward for the series -- even though it ...
248;309.0;5.0;8.0;Love this sims!!! I was expecting to hate it by all the bad reviews but I love it, its the best sims game yet. It seems more like upgraded version of the Sims 2 and that's why i like it so much more then sims 3 just got too laggy & stalled too much, with the big map and all the expansions and was getting frustrating to play. This game is fast, not laggy at all, and i love love love how they can multi-task, makes it a lots faster game to play.\n\nThe build mode is soo much better now too, super easy to use, easy to correct building mistakes without deleting half of what you built, that also makes it a much faster game and so much more fun to play!\n\nI love how its more cartooney like the Sims 2, its makes it way more fun, i love all the random quirky things that happen in the game, which the sims 3 was lacking, it brings more life into the game & reminds me of why i loves the sims 1 & 2 so much. Sims 3 was just too predictable after awhile and I got bored of it easily.\n\nThere is still a few bugs to fix but I love where they are going with this game!  I can't wait till the expansions come out!!;Love where the new sims games are going
252;310.0;2.0;8.0;This game seriously disappointed me. The graphics are great, but the game play has gone back to that of the original sims. With all of the great things we had in Sims 3, it was a real let down. This game was definitely not worth the money I spent on it. There is now open world, there are not toddlers.  The worlds are extremely small and limited. I have been a sims fan since the original Sims, but this is a serious let down.;Don't waste your money!
264;311.0;4.0;8.0;"I think this game is getting somewhat of a bad rap.  There is actually quite a bit of content, and a lot of it is ""unlockable"", though since I have sim-add I doubt I will actually unlock any of it.  Have people forgotten how ""boring"" each iteration of the Sims is when it first comes out?  To me it is the expansion packs and add on content that really make the game fun.  As far as the price goes, I think it's pretty fair considering that that is kind of the going price for decent (and many non-decent) games nowadays.  Am I going to spend the extra $10 to get what seems to be extremely minimal extra content in the premium edition?  No, but I don't think $60 is unfair considering the fact that I believe when the Sims 3 came out it was $40 or $50 five years ago and a lot of the costs surrounding game creation have gone up.  That said, I do think the game could be better, I for one was disappointed at the lack of color and styling choices not only in CAS but also in building.  As someone who is kind of OCD about matching colors, it really bothers me.  Overall though I like the game and I think it will quickly surpass everyone's opinion of Sims 3 once it has some more content (I have tended to have performance issues with Sims 3 that appear to have gone completely away in the Sims 4, so I think it will ultimately be a lot better, especially on lower-end computers).";I think this game is getting somewhat of a bad rap. There is actually quite a bit of ...
266;312.0;2.0;8.0;"The world feels very limited due to the fact that it is not a free roam world. Having to access your phone to travel is ridiculous, being able to travel in a car or jog across town is something I enjoyed in the other games. There are some fun parts but their just the basic sims functions; promotions, romance and family....done.\n\nSad.";High hopes
289;313.0;1.0;8.0;I loved playing the game, but for some reason the loading screen would look really weird, it would be distorted and so was the town map. I couldn't see the part of it cause it was fuzzy and distorted. I returned it and Amazon is sending me an another copy, hopefully this one will be better. I love the Sims and the very first Sims I played was Sims 2. I don't know why the game is getting so many bad reviews I  think it's great. I'm giving it one star because the copy I received was defective but once I recieve the new copy I'll change my review.;I had to return it.
299;314.0;2.0;8.0;What the hell happened EA. I have been faithful to this game since the beginning and look what you did to it. I am not a cynic so I still have faith that you might win the fan base back through The Sims 5 or the expansions packs for The Sims 4..which i hope won't sell us the content that we should have started with, but we will see. For now, I am definitely not going to purchase the game as is. To much for to little. :(;What the hell happened EA. I have been faithful ...
324;315.0;3.0;8.0;It is definitely different...I can't say I like it, and I can't say I dislike it either. No family trees, pools, toddlers, restaurants, hospitals, etc.  Create a Sim is fun, it is not as complicated as the Sims 3, but still has tons of options. Once you get the hang of the game, it is pretty enjoyable. I still think The Sims 2 is the best of them all, I am not much of a fan of 3.;Well...
350;316.0;4.0;8.0;At beginning of my journey into Sims 4 I quickly learned two things. One, that this is not Sims 3 and the other is that this is obviously a game that is going to further grew as time goes on. Most people just pick this game up expecting it to have everything Sims 3 had but guess what it doesn't and that isn't a bad thing. This is new material people. You just don't buy a game and then bash it because it doesn't have certain things at launch. This is THE SIMS people there will be more stuff added calm yourselves.\n\nOther than that I'm having a blast with this game. It looks beautiful, building houses is much easier and the new emotion system that Maxis has implemented into the game has greatly improved my experience. For those who are enjoying this game like myself keep on having fun but for those who don't enjoy this game GO AND F....ind someway to enjoy it.;a review from someone who liked the game
18;317.0;2.0;5.0;Boring. Nothing to do. No goals or objectives. Creativity is very limiting. Disappointing.;Two Stars
76;318.0;1.0;7.0;I feel like with the Sims 4, they could have just updated the Sims 3. There's a lot more options and a lot more household stuff but you're Sims is not free at all. Just stuff and options, that's the only cool thing. You can't go anywhere or do anything. You can't even have a car..... It's so boring and basic. The expansions won't help either.\n\nFor the people who are rating this a 4 or 5 star, this must be your first Sims game you've ever played. I used to play the Sims on my ps2 years ago and It was exactly the same! Nothing has changed in the Sims 4 from then, expect of course options and household stuff.\n\nStick with the Sims 3 and their expansions!!!!!!!!;Not even close to better then the Sims 3.
80;319.0;5.0;7.0;As with every Sims generation, the game evolves while staying true to the general gameplay. While I did enjoy the novelty of open world in Sims 3, I don't miss it with the Sims 4. The world is semi open in that you can explore your nieghborhood, and even when a loading screen pops up, it lasts for less than 30 seconds--whereas with the Sims 3, I had loading screens that would last 15 minutes or more. I feel it is a major improvement and makes the world much more lively in that I can go to anywhere in the world and find other sims to interact with.\n\nCharacter creation is amazing and incredibly immersive.  Building/construction is also much more intuitive and fluid. You can create a fully furnished house in less than 10 minutes. Also, the ability to pickup entire rooms and move or expand them without starting over is amazing as well.\n\nThe highlight of this generation are the emotions and the gestures of the sims themselves. They feel much more real and alive than past generations. I love that you can join a conversation with three other sims and be influenced by their moods or vice versa. It adds a new depth to gameplay and storytelling.;While I did enjoy the novelty of open world in Sims 3
81;320.0;1.0;7.0;Who cares if it is easier to design houses when I can't make things the color I want them to be? This is the worst decision EA made in the sims 4. We are stuck with their handful of color options when the best part of the sims used to be the freedom to create what you wanted. Sigh. Sims 4 is more frustrating than fun right now. I just hope they continue to fix the things people complain about. They really should listen to all the fan feedback.;Can't change colors!?!? So so frustrating!
82;321.0;2.0;7.0;If you want a really good sims game I'd stick with the sims 3 and save some money. Unless they make some really great expansion packs it's really not worth it and pretty disappointing.;Sims 4
85;322.0;4.0;7.0;"I have been a Sims lover from the very beginning, and have been a faithful customer as the games advanced over the years. That said, after reading the reviews for The Sims 4, i was very skeptical; most everyone expressed negative opinions. Then i discovered, after a long time of debating and grieving over not having the new Sims, i discovered that origin had a 48-hour game time trial. So i went on to download the trial and waited till my three day weekend to give it a try. It was absolutely magnificent.\n\nPro's:\n-Create a sim and build/buy mode have been much more efficient. You no longer half to enter create a sim a gazillion times if your twins have their birthday. One click and you can edit your whole household. There is also no more flipping in between build and buy. It's is one are for quick convenience.\n-Life Time wishes are changeable, at no cost to your sim. You can move back and forth between lifetime wishes without loosing progress or paying for it.\n-Auto Solve Needs. I honestly love this, though sometimes it doesn't work all that well if the sims are tired. But, say your sim is hungry. You simply click on the hunger need under the needs panel and the sim will go and feed themselves.\n-Multitasking. Probably the best advancement. Your sims can now do homework, have a chat, listen to music, all with their feet in the pool in the warm afternoon sun. I actually saw my sim eating their dinner on the toilet once, i found it hysterical.\n-No need to pay for a babysitter. Have a baby and both your sims work? the baby will simply go to daycare at no extra charge.\n-Wider variety of skills. The violin has made a return, along with the piano. There is also a rocket ship to build and explore with.\n-No more toddler years. I never really enjoyed the toddler portion of a sim's life, so i appreciated this part.\n-Pregnancy test. Yes, your young adult and adult female sims can take pregnancy tests. Because there is no longer a jingle after try for a baby, in order to find out if your sim is pregnant all you need to to is click on the toilet and pay 15$ to find out. Once the results are in the sim is immediately showing. Also, from my 48 hour experience, most sims get pregnant on the first try. Only once in my 6 generations of sims did i have trouble getting one of them pregnant.\n-Tenn Sims can now ""mess around"". When the teen has a boyfriend/girlfriend they can ""mess around"" in the bed. there is no chance of pregnancy from this.\n-Teens can also exchange promise rings\n-Mothers can mow breast feed their babies\n-Throwing parties is much more simple\n-Motherlode still works :)\n-Updated with family tree. That was originally a major downside for me but the most recent update include the family tree.\n-grades no longer effect aging up traits. you can still choose your own traits even if they have a c\n-I was also unsure about the whole emotions thing, but i really like it.\n-there is a lot more variety of food and activities\n-in a lot of ways it reminds me of the sims 2, which i personally don't mind because i  really like the sims 2.\n\nCons:\n-no more create a style. everything is just what it comes with and the options of colors. like in the sims 2. For most things, however, there is a wide variety to choose from\n-Smaller city. There are only two small towns, however you can switch back and forth between them at any time. Also, when it's time for a bigger home, it is very simple to demolish an empty one, or previous residents will have died anyways.\n-Not many career paths. Which i think they solve that problem with the new expansion pack\n-For the life span there is only short, normal, or long. You cannot customize the amount of days for each age.\n-Still a little glitchy. it's a new game, the sims 3 still has glitches from time to time, and it's 5 years old now. It's technology. It's nothing major. sometimes they all just stop what they're doing for a minute and you need to tell them to do it again. That's all.\n-i felt like the needs declined faster. but that may just be me.\n\nOverall from my 48 hour experience, it was a great game. I mean, when you think back to sims 3 before you spent all the money on the expansion packs, it was pretty basic. That's what this game is, its the base game of sims 3, with some touch ups to make it a bit different for the better, and it can become a great game with the expansion packs that i am sure they will put out. Major difference, the price.\nSo all in all, i will be putting this game in my Easter basket for myself, and if you're unsure about it like i was, it's a great game, don't fret, i completely recommend it to the Sims players of the world.\n\nI hope my review made a positive difference in your opinion for this great game. Happy Simming!";Only Took A 48-Hour Trial To Love It...Will Be Buying
101;323.0;1.0;7.0;Just... bad.  In an effort to focus more on the sims acting more like real people they neglected options and variety.  In an effort to focus more on graphics, they neglected flexibility and left tons out.  Not to mention the loading screens.  Quite simply, this feels more like an expansion pack in its content and less like a full game, and its certainly not worth anything more then $15-$20 dollars, and I might even go less.\n\nBeen playing sims since the word go.... but this is nothing but an EA money grab.  They did not listen to their fans, they listened to their wallets.;I wish I could rate it ZERO stars.

107;326.0;2.0;7.0;I've played Sims since the first one came out. My impression of this game is Sims 2 with great graphics. There is no open world like Sims 3, no toddlers, no bugulers, no color wheel, and so much more compared to Sims 3. Very disappointing having awesome graphics and emotions isn't enough for a fun game. I took mine back.;My impression of this game is Sims 2 with great graphics. There is no open world like Sims ...
25;327.0;3.0;5.0;"I recently purchased the sims 4 for PC and Mac. The game was not very easy to install in the beginning and had me researching all over the internet how to install the game that I paid for. The directions do not tell you that once you download origin all you have to do is put the code in. I wish I would have known that before I was sent on a wild goose chase trying to install the game. The game took awhile to install, but I expected that and watched a TV show until I was done. I was very excited when the game finally loaded. There were so many things to do within creating the characters and I appreciated how customized and different your Sims could be. However, you also have to purchase expansion packs which is very annoying so I refrain from buying those. I like that the Sims can do actions themselves within the game and you can interfere when you want to. I found myself using cheats to make the game more enjoyable. Overall the game is fun if you are willing to pay the price. After awhile I found the game more boring but I am excited to find out what more I can do within the game to make it more exciting. I find myself wishing that there was more within the ""neighborhoods"" and wanting discounts on the expansion packs to make the game more worthwhile. So, if you find yourself wanting this game consider a expansion pack that comes with it for a better price. The game takes awhile to load and close but I also expected that. Lastly, the game could be more exciting but I expect that it will get more interesting as I get better and move up in the game. I really wish there was more but I don't fully regret my purchase. Be careful before you buy this game and make sure you know exactly what you're getting! Have fun!";Hard to install and somewhat worth it
127;328.0;1.0;7.0;The game is incredibly frustrating. You spend so much time just keeping their needs filled while also keeping them in a good or productive mood that it gets boring very quickly, I played it for a week and haven't played it since. After all the hype and the cool looking advertisements it was a very big disappointment;You spend so much time just keeping their needs filled while also keeping them in a good or productive mood that it gets boring
131;329.0;3.0;7.0;Some elements of this game are incredible! But if you, like me, were a big fan of the Sims 3, be prepared for some serious disappointments.\n\nI love the ability to multitask. Sims will automatically talk to each other as one person does the dishes and the other watches TV. Sims are way more social in general, and group conversations are automatic and easy. In that way Sims get to make friends faster. House parties are especially cool for that reason. There are separate bars for romance interaction and platonic interaction, which gives you added control over relationships. Emotional states are awesome too. They drive social interactions and tasks. Wishes are a lot cooler and are driven by emotions. Lifetime goals don't correspond to specific careers, which I think is kind of cool. Just keep an eye on tasks. It's kind of like Sims Medieval in the sense that you don't go up unless you complete the tasks.\n\nHowever... remember the Sims 2? You could explore, but every individual place you went had to load, and any Sims left at home were left and the user couldn't control their actions or see their moods. That's how the Sims 4 is. Huge disappointment. You can't just explore like you could in the Sims 3. You have to wait for each individual place to load, even if you want to go to the adjacent lot. I was also extremely disappointed that you can not longer customize clothes and furniture. In the Sims 3 you could change any color or any pattern. Now you have to select from preprogramed colors, making the game much less customizable.\nThere are only about a dozen options for hair, skin, and eye color. There's no longer any color wheel allowing you to make any kind of outrageous Sim you want. For hair, you can't customize highlights or tip colors at all.\n\nThere are some really fun aspects of the game. But honestly, for the price, it's not worth it. Keep playing the Sims 3 and wait for some serious updates or the Sims 5.;Glorified Sims 2
27;330.0;5.0;5.0;I'd been skeptical of purchasing this game for quite a while. Mainly due to reviews on here. But I have to say, I'm glad I eventually caved and bought it. It's a nice game, played it for about 99 hours so far since I got it. And yes, I only have the BASE game. It might just be a preference thing, but I enjoy TS4 a lot. I don't mind the small lots and little travel because I rarely ever had my sims go anywhere in TS3. So TS4 works just fine for me. Patches have likely made this game better overall since it's debut, and it will likely just continue to get better.\n\nIn all, I recommend the game.;TS4 Verdict
142;331.0;3.0;7.0;Have owned the game since its release.  Imo not a simulation at all anymore, more of a linear/quest-driven style.  The new emotions were poorly implemented & add nothing to the game.\n\nJust go to their website & read what other players have to say.  Anyone with a negative comment is set upon by others & told to stop playing, ignore their complaint, or use cheats/mods.\n\nIf this is the direction the Sims franchise is headed, they'll get no more money from me.;So Disappointed
28;332.0;5.0;5.0;I'm so glad I bought this on prime day!! I was so hesitant to pay 60 dollars for it at the store. I was a little worried when I read some of the reviews that said their product codes were already used. Thankfully mine worked and I've been having a really fun time playing ever since!!;I got this for $20!!!
152;333.0;4.0;7.0;I actually own this game and have played it more than just a day or few hours.  I wanted to make that clear as it seems this game is getting a lot of hate without actually have been played or owned by a lot of reviewers.  I have played the sims since the first game way back in the early 2000s.  So I've played all four versions now.\n\nSo I will first address some issues that people seem to hate/miss from prior games......\n\nBabies are not objects, you can build relationship them right from birth and the light changes around their heads to show their moods.  There are multiple interactions available with babies too but it's true you can't leave the vicinity of the bassinet.  The bassinet is movable with the baby inside though.  No toddlers but I don't miss them yet.  They were a pain for me to potty train, bring up stairs etc.  So I like skipping all that.\n\nOpen world is gone but we have a semi open world which loads better without lag or rendering issues.  You can't tell from the world map but each lot has public space around it where you can find steams to fish in, jogging paths with sims, plants to discover, places to dig etc. etc. There are no loading screens to get to these areas.  When you do travel to another area the loading screen is only seconds long and not any longer than waiting for your sim to walk/run/drive in the open world. No rabbit holes!\n\nSwimming pools.....These are coming back in the November patch!  BTW patches have added content like ghosts, costumes, more eye colors etc.\n\nLack of Create a style.... So I thought I would miss this but I ended up not missing it at all.  Most of the clothing and objects have a ton of color/pattern choices and you can click on an object already in your house and change the color without deleting or rebuying.  Also since the sims are so interesting/have personality/do random funny stuff I find I enjoy just playing the game instead of customizing things.  For me the actual sims were borning in the sims 3 and lacked personality so I spent all my time decorating, creating outfits, changing they way they looked etc.  I don't feel the need to do that in the sims 4.\n\nLack of items/stuff to do..... I actually feel there is plenty to do and feel that there is a lot of stuff in this base game.  You can build a rocket ship and explore space(the choose your own adventure aspect is entertaining), fish, collect frogs/rocks/plants(which you can then garden)/space rocks/space creatures/space prints/elements/fossils/crystals/metals/postcards from penpals(find one on pc).  There are secret lots to unlock, very detailed gardening, detailed cooking with different options in different moods, very detailed paintings to paint, tons of different skills like rocket science, comedy, gourmet cooking to name a few of the unique ones.\n\nMoving on to what I love or enjoy personally about the game.......\n\nThe actual sims!  With the new create a sim you can easily make unique looking sims and random sims all look different.  The children born also end up looking like a mix of their parents but not weird or ugly looking which is nice.  It's fun to see how they will turn out.  The emotions really add to the game too and your sims can interact with other sims and objects in different ways depending on their moods. I find I really like to zoom in as their faces are so animated. There are so many details to the sims life now too.  Watching them learn to cook is hilarious for one.  I find I enjoy playing the different life stages now too since the sims are so interesting on their own and have personality.  All the life stages are fun again.  Being stuck in negative moodlets is gone and you can improve your sims mood or give them things to be happy about by having them do different things so they are not stuck for hours being negative etc.  Gaining weight and losing weight is much more realistic too.  One of my child sims aged up into a heavy teen who slowly got slimmer over a few days and several workouts.  There was no sudden slim down, she just shrunk slowly.\n\nMultitasking! You sim can play games, eat, workout, paint, watch tv etc. all while talking to another sim.  You can also talk to multiple sims at once.  You can even build skills while having a conversation with another sim.  You can also eat while watching tv and the list goes on.\n\nIt's entertaining.  If you just let your sims do their thing they do all kinds of stuff and all the animations are well done and detailed.  Even when you tell them what to do there are surprises and it's fun to watch them.\n\nThe public venues...  If you go to the bar all the sims will actually sit at the bar and you can talk to a large group, order drinks, drink and build relationships all at the same time.  It's also hilarious to watch the sims around hit on each other and the looks on their faces as they check each other out.  It's actually real bar behavior.  If you go to the gym the sims are working out and when your sim works out they will get to know each other and have conversations at the same time.  The venues are full of other sims doing interesting things and multitasking.\n\nIt's fun again.  The sims have personality and you care about them.  No more blank faces and foot tapping as they stand around doing nothing.  The comedy is back and there is plenty to do and explore.  Over all I have to agree with those that say if you liked the sims 2 over the sims 3 you will probably like the sims 4.  It brings back the aliveness that was missing from the sims 3 sims.  I also want to point out that my 14 year old daughter also loves this new sims game.  She played the sims 3 extensively until I broke out all my old sims 2 games a few months ago.  She was hooked and quit playing the sims 3 as she enjoyed the actual sims and their quirkiness in the sims 2.  So she has been really happy with this new game too.  Overall this review is just the tip of the iceberg on what's in the game.  Give it a chance and don't be scared away by all the negativity.;A review by someone who has bought and played the game for more than a few hours.....
155;334.0;2.0;7.0;Not loving this game. For being a base its okay. But it's pretty much a very updated version of the original sims. I prefers Sims 3 by far. Hopefully expansions will be released soon. I played it for a week and haven't touched it since I got it the week it came out.;Eh. Not in love with this new game.
168;335.0;1.0;7.0;"I haven't even purchased this game, and after downloading the free create a sim demo, I no longer plan on purchasing it! I was under the impression that one of the big selling points for this game was the new character creation suite... I disliked it immensely. It was very limited for choices... One of the most amazing things about the create a sim system was just gone! The choose your own colors for hair, and make up, as well as the choose your own colors, fabrics and patterns for the clothing was gone!. You get very limited color choices for everything and you can't even change the pattern on a shirt! Also didn't have an easy time with the ""Tactile Tool that is supposed to let you change things on your face and body. Always in Sims 2 and 3 I was able to create a Sim that looked similar to myself... I'm not perfect looking! Every feature you could choose from looked perfect and I tried manipulating them to look not perfect and had no luck. Couldn't make the bridge of my nose have a bump, nor turn up for down the tip of the nose... I did like the new tattoos over the ones in the previous Sims, but again, limited colors available. All in all not very encouraging for making me want to purchase the actual game. I think I will stick with Sims 3 and just continue to purchase expansion packs and stuff packs. Maybe one day EA will make a proper version of Sims 4 but so far... not impressed.";I disliked it immensely
174;336.0;3.0;7.0;"The Sims 4 has opened with a bit of a whimper. I'd like to think it's because by the end of the Sims 3 you could do so much (if you had all or even most of the expansion packs), but it's not that. They really stripped down the game to make it very very basic. A lot of the functionality was lost, though they did improve the menus and a few life issues (like adding the option to breast or bottle-feed your sim baby). While on the topic of babies, let me mention it is a bit creepy that they deleted the toddler phase of life, so the sim goes from baby to full-blown kid in one step- a little jarring. The big thing EA was touting for this game was the new emotion system, which is kinda neat, but at the same time a bit unwieldly for accomplishing the related tasks. It could use some tweaking to make it function a bit better. This game better be improved by expansions and/or DLC/Updates, or it's really going to fall flat on its face in the long run. I found it entertaining for about a week or two, and considering its cost this is not very good. Still, I have some hope for the future so I'm rating this as ""okay.""";Promising but Falls Flat
187;337.0;2.0;7.0;TERRIBLE! Never experienced something quite like this. Bought the game days ago. First off, game was half-way decent at best. It sounded like the game was open twice because the music overlapped itself. Had to mute it.\nTheyre making you start from scratch with items meaning, theres no dishwasher, cant own cars, no hot tubs.. So they're going to sell you expansion packs for $40 later, selling you the same stuff that you already had in the Sims 3.\nThen there was a patch update (after like the 1st day!) that stopped the game from being able to upload. We literally played the game less than 10 hours total and updated it for it not to load again!\nWe uninstalled, re-installed and did everything they suggested (EXCEPT TURN OFF THE FIRE-WALLS, DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR FIRE-WALLS!) and the whole process took hours, which turned into days. After 2 days and 2 customer reps we asked for a full re-fund. Be forewarned If you have the game for 24 hours they will not give you your money back. We argued that although we had the game for three days, weve only been able to play for 10 hours! Because we called the night before and had records of trying everything under the sun to get this game to load, and after asking to speak to a supervisor, they refunded our money but itll still take 3 business days before we see it.\nAs far as the fire-walls.. a few people that took them down as they were requested to do, noticed that they got hacked very soon after.\nGet your money back ASAP and if you want to give them another chance, wait at least 6 months before you buy again and only after keeping up with the games progress and reviews;Don't waste your time
188;338.0;1.0;7.0;Game crashes and freezes alot! It is new so I am sure there are patches that will be coming out but it is disappointing to spend this kind of money and end up with glitches!;Disappointed!
193;339.0;3.0;7.0;"I bought this game off Origin with eager anticipation for a base-game that could and should have blown the previous two out of the water. But... wait something is missing... let me see; oh yeah, toddlers (neither TS2 or TS3 left out an entire age group despite their own flaws), dish-washers, trash-compactors, pools, lockable doors, zodiac signs and other aspects that if I recall correctly even TS1 had and that game is ancient.\n\nGood news is this base-game has potential if EA gets their act together and patches it to where it ought to have been.. I love the clean, crisp, smooth graphics that look beautiful. I love the emotions and I hope to see that expanded on in future EPs. I love how much I can customize a Sims looks in CAS. Facially I have been able to get my Sims to look like anyone. Building is so easy and fun!\n\nI am not positive if it was laziness, corporate greed or austerity that caused whoever called the shots to leave out toddlers. Come on, I and millions of other Simmers play for the family aspect of the game. It's like TS1 again (regression anyone) seeing a child jump out of the cradle. It just screams incomplete..; well EA you have a chance to do damage control and patch these things in for us disappointed Simmers who see this games potential. Next time... don't leave out things that are supposed to be there. It looks bad on you.\n\nThank you however for letting pregnant Sims wear whatever they want. I also like the separate romance and friendship bars. I was waiting for something like that since the end of TS2. We're waiting for those toddlers... ahem.";Half-baked potential for amazing-ness.
195;340.0;2.0;7.0;This game is incomplete.  You have to have internet access right out of the box.  No internet, all you have is a drink coaster.;"Make the ""Internet access only"" BOLDER and mentioned in the requirements in big letters"
197;341.0;1.0;7.0;I really did not enjoy this game and I wish they would've added a lot of things they refused to.;Terrible.
234;342.0;5.0;7.0;"Okay now that I have played more of the game I think I can write a more accurate review of how I feel about it.\n\nRecently I tried opening up Sims 3 for a school project and I was amazed at how slow and horrible it looked compared to Sims 4. Sims 4 graphics are a thousand times better. I also like how in the Sims 4 your sims can do multiple things at once including talking to each other. Sometimes it gets a tad bit buggy cause sometimes your Sim can be facing away from another sim and still be talking to him/her but overall the Sim interactions are better.\n\nSo a pro about the Sims 4 is the grahpics are way smoother, ""cooler,"" and easy on the eyes.\n\nI love the new sim emotions. I do believe it will become more fun later on in the game when more expansions come out.\n\nI love how the loading screens are a million times faster. Everything in the game looks CLEANER. There is less congestion in the neighboods. Not everything is bunched together like in Sims 3, granted you don't have many places to travel to but overall how many do you need? in the base game there is a museum, park, nightclub, and a gym.. I think there also is a library? To me that is enough!\n\nI can't wait for the expansions to come out. overall its a fun game and I think people should stop hating it before giving it a genuine chance.\n\nI do hope in the future they include a lot of cool stuff...\n\nKeep impressing us Sim Creators :)\n\nMuch love and God bless!";Why all the negative reviews?
235;343.0;4.0;7.0;The sims 4 is not a bad game. Don't listen to the reviews giving it one out of five stars or 0/10. Those are people who are honestly so hurt by their own disappointment they are trying to ruin the image of the game for people who haven't played it. Now sims 4 lacks alot of features, sure. EA screwed up in the features department but lets see what makes a sims game good shall we? Addiction, replayabillity, content, and length. Sims 4 has all of these. True there may be a lack of features but the game distracts you from them. Instead of newspapers you use your phone for everything and more. Instead of dishwashers and trash compactors you drag empty plates to sinks and garbage to trash cans. The game runs smoothly and saves and loads quickly. sim creation is faster as is house building. Honestly I've made better houses in sims 4 than I ever did in any sims game. Those troubling years of trying to make a wonderful home only to find out the game screws up one piece of it due to it's restricted building tools are gone. The house you want is what you build.  Sure basements and pools need to be added but the house itself is a genie when it comes to creative builders. The game has it's flaws and it would be worse if it didn't hold such enticing gameplay which is both faster, smoother, and more convenient than ever. Lack of content, small neighborhoods, and lack of items are its faults but accepting it for what it is which is a video game, it is a good one. If you care about gameplay and making things easy and convenient and overall fluently enjoyable than you should enjoy this one. If you care more about features and content jam packed into the game then you should continue to enjoy sims 2 and 3 afterall, those expansion packs and standalone games aren't exiled you can still enjoy them for as long as you would like to sim to your heart's content.;The Sims 4 is not a bad game, just not perfect.
250;344.0;3.0;7.0;A LOT of features have been removed from this game, that is for sure. It's a closed world with loading screens between every single lot, the worlds are TINY, there is no way to add new lots (you just have to work with the 50(ish?) lots that are there. That means those 50 lots between the 2 worlds that ship with the game have to be enough for your sims AND any community lots you want), there is no create a style, there are no toddlers, babies are pretty much objects tied to bassinets, teens look identical to young adults and adults, there are no cars (only decor cars drive the streets but your sim cannot own one and there are no carpools or buses or even bikes, your sims have to walk), there are no pools, there are no terrain editing tools of any kind, and there is no story progression. Those are the main major missing features along with lots of little niggling things.\n\nTo me, this was a pretty depressing list and honestly, the game does seem even more ripe than past sims games for ridiculous amounts of overly priced DLC. However, despite all this, the game somehow manages to have engrossed me. I am surprisingly enjoying the emotions and interactions of the sims and the little goals you are asked to complete for promotions or to raise school grades. It seems like its a bit more difficult to be successful in school and work which to me, is actually more fun than the simple show up and get a promotion of the sims 3. Alos, I am generally a family player and have always loved having toddlers and children. It's still upsetting that there are no toddlers and I do definitely miss them and will be irritated if/when EA comes out with the $50 toddler expansion,  but it does seem like they have done a very good job on the children. There are just more little interactions and things for them to do that are different from the things older sims can do.\n\nOverall, I'm having a lot of fun with the game, but it IS pretty barren compared to past base games imo. I'd say if you can afford to try it out, do so or buy the digital download from origin so you have the option of returning it if you don't like it. It is definitely worth a chance if you can afford it. However, I honestly don't think it's worth $60 considering all the major features cut. Waiting for a price drop would certainly be a smart way to go.;Fun but missing a lot of features
263;345.0;3.0;7.0;I love the graphics..but very disappointed. There is not much to do, the worlds are too small, many commercial lots are missing (e.g. restaurants, schools, no cars, no work buildings) and the list goes on and on. With Sims 3, it could take you a half day to explore a world and everything it offer. With creating sims, very limited there too! you can't change colors with patterns, the list goes on and on with that too! What the hell was Sims 4 developers thinking. Are they tight on budget or were they high? With Sims 4, in 15 minutes you can do it all. I can see why the overall rating on amazon is a 2.5, I would rate it the same. Bring back similar worlds that Sims 3 had, bring back the cars, the job establishments and Sims 4 could be a hit. I'm hopping EA games pays attention to all of the negative ratings from big die hard fans like me and bring in expansion very soon.;I love the graphics
277;346.0;3.0;7.0;I have been playing The Sims since it came out. It has progressively gotten better with each new game. It's not that I did not like this game, its just that I like the Sims 3 better. I really like the open world concept , but that is my own personal preference. It is hard to get used to this game because of so many things I was used to in The Sims 3 (cars, pools, toddlers, open world, color pallet, etc.) I believe The Sims 4 has better graphics and runs better on my PC, but I just feel absence of all of things that I loved about the Sims. I am not going to hate this game because I knew there were not going to certain things in the game, and I bought it anyways. I am also not going to return this game because I am going to wait for the expansion packs to come out. Overall, I think the game is average, but it has potential. I definitely do not think it is worth $60.;It's ok, but I like The Sims 3 better.
300;347.0;2.0;7.0;This version has lost a lot in my opinion. I was expecting much more. The neighborhoods are limited and the Sim doesn't actually travel but just appears at the selected destination. The neighborhoods are very limited and confusing to get to. The hype was that this version one would have the ability to even further customize your Sim but I feel what has been left out in this version more than trumps being able to make a nose bigger or an eyebrow wider. If a whole lot more content isn't added to the game this will be the last Sims version I will be buying.;This version has lost a lot in my opinion. ...
326;348.0;3.0;7.0;Honestly, even though everyone says not to buy this game. I bought it just to get my own opinion on it. Although it is not as interactive as Sims 3. I don't hate this game and I don't regret purchasing it either. It's not EA's best but it is interesting. If you like Sims 2, buy it. :);Don't regret buying.
377;349.0;5.0;7.0;Really happy with the buy, its only $60 but I'm willing to pay for $600 for this as its just awesome!. Better graphics and gameplay makes this one the best sims game out yet and EA team deserves 5 star for this!.\n\nNo pools? no toddlers? no worries as iave never used them and they are only a waste of space on my hard drive so this is a big plus.\nNo open world? no worries, open world idea is just the worst, waste of processing power and this one is also a big plus.\n\nOpen your wallet, buy it and support it.;The best ever
405;350.0;5.0;7.0;Amazon needs to update their product description to talk about how TODDLERS are now in The Sims 4 as a FREE UPDATE! You can sink many hours into this game!;TODDLERS ARE NOW IN IT!
411;351.0;4.0;7.0;It's very different from the Sims 3, but I like it! The graphics are great, the Create-A-Sim is fantastic, and the pregnancy and babies are much more realistic! The babies are no longer swaddled in their blankets! You can do so many interactions with them, it's great. There are some things that I miss like open world concept, toddlers, pools, and cars....but I am pleased so far. The only thing I wasn't too pleased about was the steep price, but I'm glad I went for it.;Different but pleasing!
29;352.0;1.0;5.0;I Honestly Was Super excited To Get this Game For Christmas, But when I had Opened It up And Began To Play It, I was Highly Disappointed. I Understand it's The Base Game, But The Sims 3 Base Game Was Far More Impressive Than This one... The Lots Are All Small, The Towns are small.. And Another thing, The Map Is Just like The Playstation Version of the sims. One thing I Enjoyed about the Sims 3 (And Was Hoping It Didn't Change), Was That You Could Watch Your Sim Walk Around town And Not Have A Loading screen. A Free roam Town.. In The Sims 4 You Chose where you wanna Go, And BAM Load Screen. Honestly I'm Switching Back To The Sims 3 (: OH And Another thing, I really didn't Like How They made the game A Single Use Serial Code. Becausw, I Was in a foster home When I Played this game, And I was using their Origin Account.. When I Turned 18 And Moved into my Own Place I Tried to install The Game On my Computer, And It wouldn't Let Me, I contacted EA Support, And They Said I Just Have to Buy A New Copy. They Expected me to purchase Another 80 dollar Game, That I already Had Because They Made it A Single Serial Code Game... That Is Why I Am Not Fond Of The Sims 4.;Been playing Sims Since 9 Years Old, This One Is The Worst.
54;353.0;1.0;6.0;Deseption, It did not used game, its a pirated copy;One Star
56;354.0;1.0;6.0;recently purchased the game and wish I would've read some reviews before I purchased this mediocrity.\n1. The open world in sims 3 GONE\n2. Room for endless and unlimited creativity GONE!\n3. All the progression and anticipation and success from the previous game lead to this game how?\n  I personally don't understand why all these big time game developers are screwing over their loyal customers for.... not even a little pocket money!!! Bastards are trying to break and give me little.\nIf your a fan of the sim franchise, don't waste your time and your money.\n  If you are new to the sim franchise, if suggest trying to older Sim. So that you may have a first had perspective on how little the producers care for their customers. Simply disappointed....;No content. No worth...
59;355.0;1.0;6.0;I've used EA products for decades, but I'm never buying another EA product - ever. I just spent the most frustrating hour in many years trying to install this game via the discs onto Win7/64. Attempted numerous ways numerous times and failed. It insists on downloading the game (9 Gb!) from their Origin web store. Their help page addressed this very topic and spelled out how to stop the download and use the discs, but it failed just like all other attempts. That's it... I'm done with EA and their online store platform. I'm not a big fan of Steam, but at least it works as expected. Soooo frustrating.;Done with EA / Origin
63;356.0;1.0;6.0;It's official, this game is BORING!!!!  If you read the other reviews you know most of the problems.  One problem I have that was mentioned in any review is that every few minutes the game freezes and I have to go to save game to unfreeze.  This may be due to add-ons I have done but who knows.\n  EA and Maxis need to do a couple of things to make this game better than its predecessors (sp?).  Upgrade World Travel to 6 locations or more.  Add a time machine so that Sims can travel to Medival times (which can be an upgrade also) and give it to Simmers free as an apology for foisting a piece of junk like Sims 4 on us.\n  Other reviewers compare this game to Sims 2.  I think it is more reminiscent of Sims 1 which was just a neighborhood and you made multiple characters and leveled up.  That was all you did and that is all you do in Sims 4.\n  Now pardon me while I delete this garbage from my PC and reload Sims 3 and World Adventures.;Waste of money
65;357.0;1.0;6.0;Since EA didn't seem to put much effort in The Sims 4, I'm not going to put much effort in this review. TS4 felt more like the PC version of The Sims FreePlay rather than the sequel to TS3. It's like they butchered and stripped the game down as much as possible from TS3 in order to release more expansion and item packs. Screw that. Not to mention you need to download Origin to use it.\n\nSave your money and stick to The Sims 3 or get The Sims FreePlay for mobile devices. There are much better games out there. If you really must have the Sims 4, I wouldn't spend any more than $15-20 on it. There are better games out there.;I thought sequels were supposed to improve on the prequel...
68;358.0;2.0;6.0;I've played Sims since 1 and I've never been bored, but this game managed to do it.  I'm told that it was actually intended to be an online social game, but EA changed it mind.  If that's so it really shows.  You cannot customize the neighborhood, because there is no real neighborhood.  With the exception of the houses in the small section around you everything is a fake backdrop.  So you look across a street on a map, which shows a block of houses and see--a diner that isn't and probably never will be in the game.  Want a Medieval town?  Forget it.  Want a town that looks like you want ti to? Nope.  Apparently creativity and customization were not part of their vision.  All a you get are Sim icons making faces at you.  Build mode does have new tools, but the interface is so clumsy to use it's mostly frustrating.  Oh, and the different heights for walls which I was looking forward to?  They are basically useless, unless you like to see distorted wall textures.  All the walls on a level have to be the same height.  Only things I like was the look of the Sims face--they aren't fat and baloony like Sims 3.  The hair, however, looks like it was made for a cheap Barbie knockoff....  It's gonna take a lot of EPs and updates before this game is anything but dull and uninspired.;Dulled Down
77;359.0;2.0;6.0;"This is not a review on the Seller, but the actual game! I had no problem with placing an order and i had received my game neatly packed and on time -- 5* for the seller.\n\nI have loved the Sims series since the very beginning. It was exciting to observe a progress of each game. I was very excited to learn 4th season is coming up. I read some very bad reviews, but i thought ""hey, it can't be that bad. Maybe those people had just their expectations set too high. There is no way the Sims 4 can be waste of time and money."" But sure i was wrong. Once i opened up the case and started the installation it took closely to an hour to download the game onto Origin platform, and install it onto my laptop. I played for 30 minutes or so before i shut it off. So disappointed. I should have listened to those negative reviews and saved my money towards something more exciting. I purchased the Sims 4 when it was on sale for around 30 bucks, so i guess it doesn't hurt as much as if i paid a full price.\n\nI don't usually write product reviews, because i can't really comment on technical or professional level of a game, and i get rather emotions-driven.\nI gave the Sims 4 another try, played for another hour or so. It gets boring after a while. The navigation panel at the bottom of the screen is either too small, or when opened (to see the needs of your Sim...) it takes up almost a 1/3 of a height of screen on my laptop. Which is pretty annoying. It also feels like there are less options for interactions between the Sims, and the options change every time you click on the menu. Even the actually click on a Sim to begin a task is difficult, sometimes it seems like you have to chase them around for a sec before the task become active. In my opinion to build a house and furnish the rooms became more difficult as well. The categories are somehow disorganized.\nWhen you have a baby, it does not show you the needs of the baby. You just have to interact with him/her and guess. I guess more like real life, but not what i was used to in the previous Sims games.\nJust like other reviewers commented, neighborhoods where you live are too small. For a start up you get 2 towns to chose from. And then you have a few neighborhoods (4-5 houses) to chose from. So everything seems kinda chopped, because if you want to go to a park or a store, you have to leave your neighborhood, instead of just being able to seamlessly walk around.\n\nBummer is i can't return or sell this to someone else who could possibly enjoy it, because the code included is only a one time thing. I might give it a couple more hours of play time to try, but I will be most likely returning to my Sims 3 and the expansion packs it came with. Definitely more exciting than the long awaited The Sims 4.";I didn't listen to other reviewers and got burnt -- The Sims 4 is not what i was expecting
79;360.0;2.0;6.0;Like many who purchased and loved the Sims 3, I was really looking forward to the Sims 4.  When I first bought the Sims 3, I played all day without realizing it.  I think I left he computer to grab a snack or two, but that was it.  I was absolutely hooked!  So when I finally finished downloading Sims 4, I thought it was going to be just as before.  Oh how wrong I was.  The game is just plain BORING.  The worlds are tiny with very few places to go and visit.  I feel stuck to my home lot or to fishing in the stream behind the house.  The traveling feature is terrible, it's like the old spinning wheel of death on dial up.  Why can't we just travel in the cars again?  It was honestly quicker and kept my interest since I had something to look at.  The only feature that I like is the multi-tasking feature of the sim.  But I'm giving that up and going back to the Sims 3, which was fun and didn't feel like work.  I'm not sure if they just weren't ready to release this game yet and just rushed it or if they didn't listen to all of the things that we liked about the previous games, but EA missed the mark.;Don't waste your time or your money
84;361.0;2.0;6.0;"I got the opportunity to play this game for a couple of days with a free pass from EA. I think their decision to let people sample the game was a very good idea, especially now that they've gotten the worst of the bugs cleared out of the queue and have added a few features that fans were outraged about them omitting. Here is what I think someone would want to know before making a purchase:\n\n* Some aspects of the game are utterly delightful.\nYou might well find yourself quite charmed by some of the animations; they're also quite smooth technically. The game as a whole loads quickly. Create-a-Sim is beyond terrific--one could really get lost in making a Sim look exactly as desired. It gets ridiculously detailed in the level of control a player has over the process--right down to how large/small a Sim's corneas and irises are! The system is intuitive and deliciously fun. I was never good at CAS in TS3, so this was really fun. As long as you're not interested in changing hair or clothing colors, and don't mind that the options are extremely limited for both of those, the actual bodies and faces of Sims have never looked better. Also, there are a couple of ""secret"" worlds you can access, like a fairy paradise where a Sim go fishing and rock/plant/frog hunt, and they are quite beautiful and intriguing, though there isn't much to do there once the novelty wears off. Multitasking was generally very well-done--I liked how my Sim was playing chess one day and someone came by to chat with her and her chess partner while the game was going on. The scene was natural and lovely to watch--my Sim's focus shifted with the strange Sim moving closer as they talked and she played.\n\n* Some aspects of the game are totally aggravating.\nWhen left to her own devices, my Sim would suddenly drop and do push-ups--NOBODY does that in real life and it was bizarre to see. Emotions really didn't seem that intuitive or realistic, which is weird given how EA's been trumpeting emotionsemoooooootionsEMOTIONS every three seconds with this title from the start. I also heard that Sims could drop dead from stupid things like Woohooing too hard or working out, which really limited play. And build mode is uneven--some parts are neat, like being able to move windows up and down and heighten ceilings, but it's too easy to accidentally a room and that costs money and takes time to repair. A lot of people have complained about load screens and yes, they do get old quickly--and they take longer to load the longer one plays. Every time a Sim moves to a new venue or house, the whole game just stops to load. This was such a shoddy, frustrating design decision that I just have to wonder who thought it'd be fine. And yes, the gameworld is TINY compared to previous games in the franchise. You get a library, a gym, a nightclub, and a museum, and that's about it. Careers are sharply limited and work as they did in TS1; the Sim leaves in the morning and vanishes from the map while at work, then returns at night.\n\n* Most aspects of the game are perplexing or boring.\nI don't expect a base game to be filled with stuff, but even considering how new the game is, there's just nothing in there that I really like or enjoy seeing. It looks simplistic, cartoony, and worse, boring. Without Create-a-Style (CASt) to change up colors and patterns, Simmers have to rely on the game designers' color combinations, and most of them are beyond flat and uninteresting. And I wasn't pleased to see that the interesting stuff was locked and couldn't be accessed without achieving goals ingame. The ""whims"" system is a lot like the TS3 wish system; fulfilling them gets you experience points that can be exchanged for perks like in TS3. I didn't find it engaging. Each Sim also has an overarching goal that players can work toward fulfilling, but this, too, didn't hold my attention. And frankly, after exploring the few public venues in the game and the secret worlds, there just wasn't anything to do. This game is like a freemium game--jussssst engaging enough to keep you there, but not actually fun; I have to wonder if this design was deliberate, given EA's money-grubbing DLC antics of late on the mobile game platform. My Sim ended up painting or reading at the library or WooHooing her cute boyfriend, day after day after day after day like it was Groundhog Day. I'm utterly at a loss about all the mechanics stuff that EA decided to leave out of TS4; there's just not a lot to do here, and what there is, gets tedious and repetitive after a surprisingly short time.\n\nSo is it worth it? Well, about a half hour of playing each session, I started wandering off mentally and physically. This game just isn't as immersive as previous titles. I've been playing since the Sims 1 first came out, and every other game in the franchise has utterly captivated me. I can look up and hours have passed. Not so with this game.\n\nIt reminds me most of the mobile/tablet game The Sims FreePlay in how the Sims act, walk, do whims, and even look, as well as in how the gameplay is very short-focus-oriented. It couldn't be more of a DLC-draw than if EA had put that exact sentiment into the loading screen. It's simply not worth even the slashed price of currently $50. I'm very disappointed--I wanted very much to like this game and was just crushed when it became clear it would not be a worthy successor to TS3. It's more like TS1 with better graphics, but even then it's just not as rich or engaging as TS1 was--and nowhere near TS3's fun factor.\n\nRatings: This game should be fine for anybody over the age of 12 or 13. There are references to WooHoo and drinking but these are disguised; there's only cartoon violence. This is one of the most innocent games I've ever seen with the T rating.";Not worth the price. Not awful, just not worth anywhere near a AAA-game price.
90;362.0;2.0;6.0;I'm a long time Sim player. I was really looking forward to the version. I've given it plenty of time and I've already done everything to be done in the game all goals, ambitions, job, and everything else completed. The graphics are great but the game play feel dumbed down. It feels like a lot of the features have been taken away to gear it toward people unfamiliar with The Sims games. I have no problem with trying to get more people into the games. I just feel like the long time players got short changed here. I will not be buying any expansion packs and since I've thoroughly explored all available options in this game I most like will not play it until I get nostalgic for The Sims. Over all very disappointed.;Disappointed
95;363.0;1.0;6.0;A poor excuse for a sequel.;One Star
96;364.0;1.0;6.0;"This game is terrible and a waste of money. First, If you have one sim on a different community lot than another sim you can't control both. The sim you aren't controlling  will ""care for itself"".  ""Care for itself"" is the worst gaming option in the history of Sims. This means you have your sim doing one action and then you leave him or her to go to that other sim on a different lot. That original sim will do another action, immediately after you switch, usually something non-productive. It is so frustrating. I can't get my sims to do anything I want. For example, I tell my sim to paint and then I switch off to the other sim. Even when I have the game paused the whole entire time, my original sim will just change to play video games!\n\nSecond, There is less of pretty much everything compared to sims 3. There are less houses, less people, less earning of money, less traits, less aspirations (if you played the sims 3 it is pretty much lifetime goals), less community buildings, less cheats, and etc. There is less world space. The 2 worlds are practically only one, but they are barley different because there on 2 different slides. Both of those together are still less world space than sims 3. Sims 3 also had a 3 dimensional view of the map, but sims 4 has a 2 dimensional carton version of the map.\n\nThird, You have to load every time you go to a new lot. Fourth, You have to have an automatic trait that you don't pick with your aspiration. fifth,The new emotions make the games pretty complicated. Sixth, The community lots that were there before is sims 3 aren't there anymore. Seventh, You have to load to go to each new lot, and usually building. There are so many more flaws with sims 4 with so little improvements. Do not purchase this product.";DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
102;365.0;1.0;6.0;This is worth MAX about $4.99 as an app. The features are stripped down to worse than the Sims 1. I shudder to imagine EA execs scheming to charge us for a dishwasher as DLC. EA needs to start feeling the heat from us consumers or they will keep ruining our favorite games.;EA has done it again
105;366.0;3.0;6.0;I per-ordered my game, so there were no reviews to check out, no real videos to watch. I went in with a blind eye. The graphics are amazing, the build mode is awesome and I have been lucky to be without glitches. However, this game in my honest opinion is not worth the full price that they charge. It's better to get this on sale. EA was greedy and pushed out an unfinished base game. They do have free patch updates, that include some of the content that was missing, but even after those patches, this game is still pretty hard to play. I get bored really easy but I am still glad I have it. Don't make the same mistake I did though by paying full price for it.;Get it on Sale!
36;367.0;1.0;5.0;"We all know what EA is famous for; they put out an overpriced product with limited content, that they are already planning on putting into an overpriced expansion. Fine.  That was at least somewhat tolerable with The Sims 3, which was by far the most amazing Sims game ever.  I have played every Sims game since the very beginning, logging onto the Sims with Windows ME on my old Gateway computer.  After seeing the reviews on this one I decided to check it out before buying it. Luckily I had a friend who had sadly preordered it, and I was able to experience it, if that's what you'd call it.  The base game is lacking in so many ways, all you have to do is look at other detailed reviews to see them, so there's no need for me to repeat them. I'm so glad that I didn't waste my money on this game.  EA has gone too far, and they're already releasing lackluster and overpriced ""expansions"" and content collections. It's time for me to say goodbye to EA once and for all.  Maybe we should all stop buying their products, and they might look past their greed and return The Sims back to its original greatness.";EA Money Grab
37;368.0;1.0;5.0;Not anywhere as good as Sims 3.;The Sims 4 - PC/Mac
39;369.0;2.0;5.0;"I played this game because I love the Sims. I have been playing the Sims since Sims 1. I had Sims 1 double deluxe. I bought most of the expansion packs for the Sims 2 and all of the expansion packs for the Sims 3. I love this game franchise. I do not love the Sims 4. While playing the game, the most overwhelming thought you will have is ""is this it? Is this what I paid so much money for?"" The game is sorely lacking. When you create a new game in a series, you are supposed to be moving forward. The Sims 4 moves backward and it's a shame. You will almost certainly feel let down playing this game. There just feels like there is nothing to do and this game is pointless. Maybe it will improve once they add in some expansion packs, but I am of the mind that for a game that costs this much, it should be worth playing all on its own. Sims 3 was worth playing without any expansion packs at all. So was Sims 2. This game is not. They have removed so much stuff for no apparent reason. Clearly the fans didn't want this stuff removed. Bring back the things we know and love about the Sims!!!";Is This It?
40;370.0;1.0;5.0;"To put it simply, the wrong people worked on the development of this game. I never thought I'd make this comment about a Sims game, but this game deserves a '1 start' because I haven't been able to enjoy the time spent playing this game at all. The Sims 1-3 were fun and 4 is just not fun. and is lacking in entertainment value. The game feels and plays as if the work was outsourced to strangers of the series and this group missed something really integral. The features added served as minor details that hardly made up for the single biggest problem in this game: the interface is horrific. The controls are overly complicated for the sake of looking sleek, to the point of not being functional. The camera angles are difficult to maneuver. Why, when the camera served its purpose successfully in 2 and 3, would there be such a huge change now in 4? The added steps to do simply things, like the drop-down menu in buy mode, makes the game difficult to navigate in a way that detracts from the game play. The 'information' bars are too small and are difficult to read, like time/day, etc. The controls, overall, are frustrating to the point of appearing flat-out incorrect. Common sense was not used in the making of this game, there's so much emphasis placed on how everything looks that it's laughable. You can pick your characters' style of walking, adjust the tone of their voice and make slight changes to their facial features - oh, and the face adjusters are overly complicated and difficult to use as well - but you lose game content. I can't create my own lot and send two sims there for a date? For some reason my sims can multitask, for instance they can carry a conversation with a third party while playing chess, but again features that were great in 2 and 3 are gone. This game is nonsense. It's backwards: all looks and nothing else. I fired up sims 2 and you know what? It doesn't look as good, but I can actually enjoy the sims 2 and care a little about my characters. I can play sims 2 and 3 (though I'm more of a 2 fan) for hours, but I almost have to force myself to keep trying with 4. There's a strange thing going on with the sims 4 that as soon as I open it, I almost feel like it's a bore and I want to close it. That's a very strange effect for a game to have on a person. The family controls are off and incorrect. Even the wording of information blurbs seem off, and not off in the class Sims-humor off. Did English-speakers make this game? I simply questions far too much while I'm playing. The 'magic' is gone. While playing previous installments, it was very fun to improve skills, advance in a career, build generations and make sims fall in love - this game is lacking that, because of the way the interface is set up. There's the saying, ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it"" and that's what this game feels like - purposeless, thoughtless changes made to that which was fine rather than improving on parts that need work. I don't see the innovative leaps that 2 and 3 offered from previous installments.\n\nOn another note, and I only noticed this after forcing myself to play for another 45 minutes, the stress on the social aspects of the game rather than family, careers and skills in combination with the oddly sparse community lots provided (a gym, juice bar, library and museum) made me recognize that this game feels and plays oddly and sadly like a dating simulator. Anyone who's even spent 10 minutes on such a game will notice the canny resemblance to The Sims 4, which is why I am giving the game a 1-star rating. Other reviewers have hit the nail on the head when they've mentioned that these sims live as if nothing matters. That may seem like a strange comment if you haven't played the game and have TS1/2/3 to compare to, but it's true. This installment of the Sims is stuck in a reality TV show with bad camera angles; it's all looks, and no content.";All looks, no content.
41;371.0;1.0;5.0;My SIMs 4 was Silently Revoked\n\nI had three fraudulent EA Sports games charged to my account. I contacted EA support and they took care of the fraudulent charges, but then they mistakenly marked my SIMS 4 as fraudulent. EA's approach to fraud is shameful. I spent countless hours with EA support over a years time and finally got them to admit that it was revoked, and then gave me assurances it would be taken care of and told me to contact EA at accountdisputes@ea.com. They then proceeded to close all the support cases I had open to try and resolve the issue and after 3 attempts to contact, they still haven't responded. Bottom line, my legitimately purchased SIMS 4 is as good as a useless rock and I have wasted countless amount of time trying to get this to work for my daughter.;You Pay for EA's Mistakes - This software could cost you.
43;372.0;2.0;5.0;"I wanted to like this game after playing The Sims 3 obsessively since it first came out. Every TS3 expansion pack and stuff pack were auto pre-orders for me. On that note, I pre-ordered The Sims 4 and feel completely ripped off. It is not nearly worth the price I paid. Gone are the two biggest things I loved about TS3: open worlds (fewer loading screens!) and the Create a Style tool.\n\nTS4 is claustrophobic to me and I find that I keep my sim at home much more just to avoid those lame loading screens (there's a loading screen even to visit your neighbor!). That alone bores me to tears. But there is NOTHING for the sims to do outside their home anyway except go to the gym or art museum for some good times.\n\nThe clothes, furniture, and decor only come in certain colors that are often slightly different shades than the other items that you'd like to pair with them -- and that can't be fixed without mods. The way-too-cartoonish art style and weird plastic-y look of the sims with their dorky expressions are a big turn off for me as well. Even mods can't hide that.\n\nTS4 has been marketed as ""these sims multi-task and show EMOTIONS!!!"" which is a blatant lie in my opinion. To give just one example, when a sim cheats on their spouse (which is way too easy to do and has NO consequences) the non-cheating spouse shows ZERO response, 'emotional' or otherwise! And the multi-tasking is mostly them eating on the toilet (ewww) or reading and watching TV. What's so amazing about that?\n\nIf you're a multi-sim player, that's a bit cumbersome as well, so I don't even bother with a couple or a family anymore and keep them single just to avoid the frustration of it. Again -- boring.\n\nThere are some things I do like: the build mode is awesome! I love that you can move artwork and curtains up and down on the wall. These are the only things I can think of at the moment.\n\nAll in all, I don't think even a new EP or GP or SP can change this game enough for me to play it consistently, so I'll save my money for The Sims 5 and hope that it's a true step forward in the Sims franchise rather than a huge step back that this shallow frustrating game is.\n\np.s.

158;376.0;2.0;6.0;I am a massive fan of The Sims.  I own the original Sims, 2, and 3, all the expansions for all versions.  I was so excited for Sims 4.  I just bought it through Origin today and 12 hours later, I asked for a refund.  The controls, for me, are not user friendly.  Clothes cannot be fully customized ( like Sims 3 ). Can't copy color schemes.  It was like playing Sims 1, only a 2014 updated version.  I am going to wait for an expansion or two, before picking this up again.;Ok, but not great.
160;377.0;4.0;6.0;"[i]The Sims 4[/i] has been mired in controversy since before its release. Many people have dreaded that this game would be a disaster because of the things that were cut either due to time constraints, technical difficulties, or simply because of the direction that the development team decided to take (Toddlers, pools, Create a Style, open world, burglars, etc.). Others have had their doubts about this game because they didn't send out pre-release copies for professional game reviewers...Then there are the folks who just hate the colorful, cartoon-like aesthetic of the game because they want every game they play to look as close to a live-action movie as technology will allow. But, even though the game was rushed out the door by impatient EA execs desperate to get returns on the next iteration of one of their biggest cash cow franchises ""yesterday,"" as it were, [i]The Sims 4[/i] has still shaped up to be a pretty darn good.\n\n In [i]The Sims 4[/i], the developers attempted to bring together some of the best elements from every game in the series so far, as well as improving the A.I. and personalities of the sims themselves and optimizing the game to play well on just about any halfway decent laptop or desktop. That's a lot of considerations to make for a single game. As a result, we have semi-open worlds with loading screens reserved for visiting neighbors' homes and other neighborhoods while allowing the player to free-roam the much of area around their current location (with, of course, a few obligatory ""invisible walls""), but we also have a vastly improved Create A Sim system, improved emotions which breathe new life into the sims during gameplay, and a Build Mode which makes both building [i]and[/i] remodeling easier than ever.\n\nCreate A Sim\n\n Create A Sim is the first feature that you will encounter when starting a new game, so I'll start with that first. The Create A Sim mode is a vast improvement over [i]The Sims 2[/i] (the only other game in the series which I have personally played). No longer must one scroll through page after page of different colors of the same shirt or dress. Instead, there is an icon showcasing the style of a piece of clothing and a handy drop-down menu for picking the color and pattern. When it comes to making the sims themselves, the new sculpting system allows the player to push, pull, drag, and tweak everything to utter perfection...well, aside from hand size, but I'm sure they have their reasons on that one. You can customize your sim's body type to be as big and burly or frail and dainty as you so desire, and you can sculpt the likeness of pretty much anyone you know with striking accuracy. You can even customize their voice and pick their walk cycle! This, of course, is every character designer's dream.\n\n What is [i]not[/i] every character designer's dream is the hair style selection. Of course, it's just the base game, but there is a near complete lack of curly styles for both male and female sims. Male sims get especially shafted in the hair department because there are several styles which sit strangely--almost helmet-like--on the head, and the styles categorized as ""long"" are all actually short and medium-length. This, of course, means that all of Sephiroth's, Kenshin's, and Kurama's fangirls are going to have to wait for an expansion pack, DLC, or hunt for custom content to make good sim versions of their fictional boos. There is also only one full formal suit in the entire selection (even though you can still mix-and-match up some nice formalwear), and the overall selection of full-body male outfits...well, it's not great. Then again, the above is just kind of par for the course with any sort of virtual paperdoll game--curly hair is always nearly non-existent, mens' clothing and hair styles don't really get top priority--so I'm used to it. Not happy about it, but used to it.\n\n In order to craft your sim's unique personality, you must pick their traits and aspirations. Aspirations are basically what your sim values most in life (and can be swapped out in-game). Most of them have two or three branching choices (the only exception being Fitness) and each aspiration comes with a special bonus trait. In addition to the bonus trait granted by your sim's aspiration, you can also choose their main personality traits: Children get one, Teens get two, and Young Adults through Elders get three. A sim's traits really do have an effect on gameplay. Sims with the Loves the Outdoors trait start getting tense if they're stuck inside for too long, Evil sims love making others miserable and causing trouble, Hot Headed sims get angry at random, and Insane sims have some...very odd...mood swings. You can combine certain traits to either make your sim's life easier or more challenging to play because of this. For instance, you can give a sim the Friend to the World aspiration, and then saddle them with the loner trait so that they are forced to overcome their extreme shyness. Or, you can give a sim the Painter aspiration, and then give them the Perfectionist, Creative, and Art Lover traits so that making their dreams come true is a breeze. Of course, you don't [i]have[/i] to fulfil your sim's aspirations if you don't feel like it...it's fun to try, though.\n\nBuild Mode\n\n In the beginning, there was the room tool, and it was good. Four walls in one quick click-and-drag...but if you wanted to expand those four walls, you needed to knock 'em down and rebuild them. Well, not anymore! In the new build mode, you can plop down a room that's only 1X1, then select it and use the handy-dandy arrows on the sides to make it as big as you want! That is probably be best thing that the new build mode had brought to the table. Other great new features include the ability to change the curvature of the roof (Convex? Yes. [i]Concave?[/i] Abso-freaking-loutely!), drop-down menus to pick the colors of things like wall coverings and stairs instead of having to scroll through pages and pages of repeat items, and the fact that Build Mode and Buy Mode are [i]one and the same![/i] No more flipping between modes while building and decorating your home. It's all there, no mode switching needed! You can also freely adjust the heights of windows and wall decorations and, for the first time ever, choose the height of the walls--very handy for those who love high ceilings. You can also adjust the position of furnishings to the half-square, finally making off-center coffee tables in front of 3-square couches a thing of the past.\n\n There are just two things that are a bit troublesome in build mode: fences and foundations. Fences have been revamped so that the default mode automatically places the fencing around the perimeter of a room. This is handy for decks and balconies, but when you're fencing in the area around a the top of a set of indoor stairs or trying to put a fence around your home...well, it's a bit confusing at first until you look at the menu and that there actually [/i]are[/i] other options for a change. The option that you want for placing sections of fencing the old-fashioned way is Draw. You still can't place a fence at the very edge of the property, however, and must place it one square in.\n\n As for foundations, they work the complete opposite way from how they worked in [i]The Sims 2[/i]. Instead of laying the foundation first and [i]then[/i] building the walls, one must first build the walls and [i]then[/i] go to the foundation tool and use the slider to raise the height of the building. Of course, the advantage is that you can now make as high or as low a foundation as you like instead of being stuck with one set height, so six in one hand, half dozen in the other. Again, it takes getting used to.\n\nLive Mode\n\n Here is where the real action in this game is. This is the part where we make the magic happen and make our sims' lives either a shining success or a flaming wreck. Welcome to Live Mode!\n\n Now, because of the absence of pools, there will be no pool parties or ""unfortunate pool accidents."" If you never used pools all that much for either purpose, however, then you won't much mind their absence here. The lack of a fire department means that you're on your own when your sims' attempts at emulating Emeril Lugosi go horribly awry, but the absence of that overzealous social worker means that you don't have to hire that useless lay-about of a nanny if you want to play a household with a single, working parent.\n\n More on family play in a bit, but first let's take a look at the dirt basics. First of all, make sure that you either buy your sim some exercise equipment or make sure they get out to the gym regularly if you made them either trim or muscular, because otherwise that sexy babe you made in CAS is going to start losing their figure. There's a mod out that stops body changes completely, but it's less hassle to just make sure that your sim eats right and exercises. The dynamic body changes happen automatically and (as of this writing) there is no convenient fitness meter to keep track of things like in [i]Sims 2[/i]. How the game categorizes fattening and healthy foods is still a complete mystery to most players, as the game does not give you any hints on that front either. Cake is sort of obvious, but everything else...could use some clarification.\n\n The job and aspiration systems in this game are much improved this time around. Aspirations now have tiered levels with requirements to fulfil to reach the next stage. While some may not appreciate this system and feel pressured into rushing around to complete every stage, I actually find it to be a lovely extra challenge and much better than the Lifetime Wishes from [i]Sims 2[/i], in that most don't run the risk of conflicting with the character progression that the player may have in mind. Mind you, I said [i]most.[/i] The ones having to do with having to reach a certain level in a career are probably the most intrusive, mainly for players who want to play unemployed sims who make their living from freelance work or selling collectables. In my experience, though, most of the things required to level up in an aspiration are things that the player would probably do naturally anyway over the course of gameplay.\n\n When it comes to jobs, I am very happy to see progression change from a grind-fest for friends and skill levels to a more varied and interesting system. In fact, for some careers, making friends isn't necessary for a promotion at all! Gone are the days where advancing in some careers was nearly impossible without keeping one or two sims at home to man the phones and rush out to the street to chat up random strangers. Now, advancing on the job can be as simple as winning a couple of chess games or washing the dishes! Then there are the daily tasks, which give an extra boost to your sim's job performance. When the performance bar gets that gold check beside it and the other requirements are met, your sim gets promoted. Children improve their grades in school the same way. Nope, no more ""just do the homework and show up"" A's. Now, they have to work for it.\n\n Of course, making money isn't just about workin' for the man every night and day. Your sims can also work from home as in previous games. They can make a living as writers, freelance programmers, treasure hunters, and gardeners. They can go down to a club or the park and pay their way by playing music or telling jokes. There's even the new woodworking skill, which allows your sim to make furniture and wooden sculptures to either decorate their homes or pawn off for some quick cash. Believe me, your sims will rarely go broke enough to have their lights and water shut off in this game...well, unless you either want them to or you really aren't all that good at this game.\n\n When it comes to exploring your environment, [i]The Sims 4[/i] not only offers good-sized neighborhoods for your sims to explore while they're on their home lot, but also great big parks and a decent-sized area around the default community lots to explore as well. You can travel between towns freely this time around, and you only encounter loading screens when you visit a new part of town or a new building. There's lots to do when out and about, including clubbing, hitting the gym, taking a stroll around the park, collecting gems and plants, and even digging for buried treasure! There are two secret lots, one in each town, which require special conditions to unlock. One is fairly easy to get into, while the other requires you to max out a certain skill to enter. After you get the door open, you're just a quick text adventure mini-game away from some very interesting exclusive goodies.\n\n But, enough about that stuff, let's talk about the sims themselves. After all, they're the stars of this show...and they are certainly quite the little hams sometimes! The new emotions system brings your sims to life like never before. How they're feeling at any given moment can change how they walk, how they close the refrigerator door...even what they cook! Yes, there are special recipes which are only available when a sim is feeling a certain way and they can affect the moods of the sims who eat them! You can manipulate your sim's mood with certain dcor, as well as different types of showers, baths, music, T.V. shows, and social interactions. Be careful, though. If your sim gets too worked up...well, let's just hope they don't fear the reaper.\n\n Your sims are also a lot more expressive and interesting to watch this time around. I find myself zooming in and taking more screenshots in play this time around than I ever did in [i]The Sims 2[/i]. Just watching how their expressions and gestures are when they're talking with each other is very entertaining, and the little things that they do all on their own are anywhere from amusing to sweet...to sometimes kind of gross. On the gross side, a sim with low cooking skill will sometimes dig in their ears while making a salad...and then promptly proceed to continue mixing said salad with their bare hands! ...Well, at least now they automatically wash their hands after using the toilet. That's something.\n\n As I said above, traits can really affect your gameplay experience as well. Not only do certain traits have an effect on your sims' moods and how they react to certain social situations, but there are also a few interactions that are exclusive to sims with certain dispositions. For instance, Hot Headed sims have an exclusive interaction called ""Rile Up"" with can get other sims nice and mad! Also, Evil sims will often randomly laugh maniacally when they're in a good mood and Gloomy sims can share depressing thoughts with others.\n\n In addition to traits, jobs and skills can also affect what interactions are available to any given sim. Sims who reach a certain level of the Criminal career can pick other sims' pockets, and at level 10 of the Comedy skill, sims learn a joke that is literally a killer (The Joker approves this content). While most of the special interactions are nothing to write home about, it's the ones that really do something that can really make your game.\n\n The new multitasking feature can be sort of a double-edged sword, though. On the one hand, it's very handy for starting sims to be able to sit on the couch and eat while watching the cooking channel, and it's very cute to watch a sim rocking out to some kickin' tunes while on the computer. On the other hand, talking and eating can sometimes make mealtimes unnecessarily long, and your sims will automatously turn on the radio if they have settled in to do anything at all near one (so, yes, your sims are still addicted to the freaking radio). So, multitask responsibly, kiddies.\n\nFamily Play\n\n This bit gets its own section because it's such an important part of the game for a lot of players. Now, yes, Toddlers are not in the base game for the first time since their introduction in [i]The Sims 2[/i]. That has a [i]lot[/i] of family and legacy players barking mad. There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth over the fact that time constraints forced the developers to shelve Toddlers...but even with their absence, family play is not dead in this game. Far from it. In fact, in my opinion, family play is better than ever!\n\n For the record, I'm not a big fan of playing families with kids in [i]The Sims 2[/i]. Unreasonable gameplay restrictions for the Child and Toddler age groups ended up forcing me to have to basically make the same family over and over every time I wanted to play family-style...and that really was no fun at all. In [i]The Sims 4[/i], however, this has been rectified! Now, one can play a family with a single, working parent and a Child without having to hire that do-nothing nanny. The social worker NPC no longer exists and ""Social Services"" only removes your child if they're either near death or failing to the extreme in school (don't know why they added the school condition, though...). This also now means that you can have [i]both[/i] parents work instead of having to anchor one down to the home until the last kid turns Teen or hire that worthless waste of simoleons and game code! Finally, the player can play more realistic family scenarios without being punished by the game or having to use third-party mods! And how is this?\n\n Children can [i]finally[/i] make themselves something other than juice, chips, cookies, or leftovers, first of all. Sure, you can still have the parent make an eight-serving platter of food, stick in in the fridge, and have the kid have that for dinner every night. However, Children can now also make cereal, yogurt, microwave oatmeal, microwave pastries, and T.V. dinners. Thank. You. Gaming. Gods. I mean, what normally functioning school-aged kid can't make a bowl of cereal or a peanut butter sandwich for crying out loud?! Now, it's finally more like a true simulation of life in this regard and I really just can't stop smiling about it.\n\n As for Babies, yes, they are bound to the crib this time around...not that any sensible player didn't keep the kid in the nursery at all times and always put him back in the crib anyway in order to prevent ""floor-babies"" when Mommy or Daddy decided they'd rather go play videogames. I actually didn't have any trouble with Babies since, as in [i]The Sims 2[/i], I always have my sim parents check on the kid every few sim hours and keep the nursery next to the master bedroom to improve response times in the middle of the night. I'm actually glad that I didn't need to place a fridge or a trash can in the nursery this time around for feeding time, though. Even though there is no maternity leave this time around, Babies don't get left home alone. They are instead whisked away to daycare until someone comes home. Unfortunately, only Teens and up can actually care for the little tyke while Children can't...which has led to some awkward situations for some players when their grade-schooler comes home and suddenly the Baby is back too...\n\n The lack of Toddlers...well, it doesn't bother me. I understand that, for some players, seeing a crib-bound infant turn into a school-aged kid in one quick animation can be off-putting, but I found it no stranger than seeing a slightly bigger baby poof into such. I don't miss the mad dash for Toddler skills, or the extremely limited playability that the lifestage had to offer in [i]The Sims 2[/i]. I don't miss the fact that a kid who's old enough to walk still can't let himself out of his crib or sleep in an actual bed so that he can get to the potty on his own once he can pee by himself, or can't scoot down the stairs, or can't draw on the walls, or pull things out of dressers and wardrobes, or tear up the newspaper, or climb all over the furniture. For those who enjoyed playing with Toddlers which were more like adorable babydolls than real kids, they will certainly miss that part of the game. For those who weren't fond of that sort of gameplay, it's a step up. Granted, an even better step up would be if they bring Toddlers back in an expansion pack with a big selection of fun interactions to expand and improve their playability as sims...but as of this writing, the future of Toddlers is an uncertain one at best.\n When it comes to the way that family members interact with each other, it is most certainly sweet. It's just amazing watching a younger sibling hanging out and messing around with their older sibling. It's so real and believable. The animators really did a great job this time around. Watching parents talk with, hug, snuggle, and play with their children is a real heart-warmer (a rare thing in gaming these days). Watching my single father hang out on the bed having quality time with his young son was a real treat for me. It really was one of those warm-and-fuzzy sitcom moments. The only thing that could have made family time better is if sims could talk to each other while fishing. Then, it would be perfect.\n\nRotational Play and Story Progression\n\n [i]The Sims 4[/i] does not have the same style of story progression as [i]The Sims 3[/i]...and for rotational players like myself, that's a good thing. You can set the rate of aging and you can also choose whether all households age at the same time, only the households that your have played age, only your current household ages, or just turn aging completely off. The aging settings, unfortunately, have no effect on pregnancies and those [i]will[/i] come to term off-camera. Another annoying quirk is that your sims are able to establish romantic relationships off-camera while they are acting as extras on and around whatever lot you are currently playing on when you're playing another household. Hopefully they fix that in a future patch or expansion, because it is very weird to come back to your young, single sim and find an old lady with a romance bar under the normal relationship bar. (Dude! Are you looking for a sugar momma behind my back?!)\n\n Your sims will [i]not[/i] conceive new children or advance in their careers off-camera, however. Those things are still in the player's hands. Friends made off-camera can be helpful in advancing past certain points in a career, though, so if you don't feel like actually playing through that, you can just flit over to another household for a few sim days and come back to Jimmy Sim with those three additional pals he needed for his promotion. Yeah, a little lazy, but it works.\n\n The development team [i]is[/i] working with the player community to fine-tune the story progression options, though, so maybe in a future expansion or patch you'll be able to truly tweak said options to your preferred definition of perfection.\n\nTechnical Stuff\n\n Well, I've gone on and on about the actual gameplay, but I know that a lot of you are now crying, ""That's all well and good, but what does it look and play like?!"" That's a reasonable question, especially after so many people experienced performance issues with [i]The Sims 3[/i] on machines which [i]should have[/i] been able to play the game well (even some expensive, top-of-the-line gaming PC's had trouble with that one). So, what's the verdict on [i]The Sims 4[/i]?\n\n I'm running this game on a Toshiba Satellite C55D-A5108 laptop, and it runs like a charm. The loading screens are very quick, under 15 seconds in most cases, sometimes as short as 5 and never longer than 20-25 (and that's usually if I'm loading up a really big lot or forgot to deactivate my background stuff). Some people have had issues with the game crashing if they play in online mode all the time. Others have encountered problems when playing on graphics settings higher than the optimized settings that the game automatically picks depending on your machine's capabilities. Since I play with my game offline unless I want to upload or download something (and disconnect right afterward), and always play on the optimized default settings, I have not had a single crash in all of my cumulative 60+ hours of gameplay. I don't know my [i]exact[/i] gameplay hours because I always play through my desktop shortcut instead of through the Origin app, so it doesn't keep track of my gameplay hours. However, I have had quite a few 5-10 hour sessions on this game since I got it, so I know I've played at least 60 hours...maybe 70.\n\n An issue that people sometimes have as a game save grows is that load times will creep up and get longer, but that can easily be fixed by clearing your cache periodically. There are some helpful articles online right now with instructions on how to do this...without breaking your game. I advise looking them up before attempting to clear your cache if you aren't a computer genius.\n\n As for how the game looks? All you have to do is search up screenshots of how the game looks on Ultra for how amazing it is on the maximum settings. However, even in Laptop Mode, 3D renders on Medium, everything else on Low...this game looks amazing. Now, I'm not the type of person who usually cares all that much about graphics in a game. To me, as long as my gameplay isn't hampered by poorly chosen textures, too-dark darkness, and bad camera, I'm cool. [i]The Sims 4[/i]'s graphics, however, have managed to impress even a gameplay-over-graphics gal like myself.\n\n I love the bright, colorful aesthetic. It fits well with the over-all feel of the game and it feels more like the logical next step up from [i]The Sims 2[/i]'s graphics than anything that I've seen of [i]The Sims 3[/i]. The world is full of vibrant, life-like details--like fireflies at night and a river boat passing by in the southern-themed town Willow Creek, or the rocky terrain and strangely-out-of-place green lawns in the southwest-themed town of Oasis Springs (anyone who has ever visited the southwestern U.S. or lives there knows why the latter is fitting). It's very apparent that the artistic team behind this game has done their research to really bring these places to vivid life.\n\n And, even on the settings that the game runs at on my computer, the quality of the graphics is very good. There are a few scenery pieces that are weirdly flat and really show it when you rotate the camera and they rotate with it, but that's probably just a quirk of my game settings and those things are pretty rare anyway. It's usually just bushes or scub...though I did see one ""cardboard"" tree. On low settings, pixily edges are a given, but they're not particularly bad and the character models and environments are still very detailed for something that's supposed to be on ""low"" settings. All of this tells me that even though they did their best to optimize the game to play well on older machines, lower-end machines, and laptops, they really worked hard to make sure that the game still looks good regardless of what kind of machine you play it on. For that, I've got to give them props.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\n Alright, so [i]The Sims 4[/i] isn't perfect. Then again, no videogame is. Even the great classics of gaming history have bugs and weak areas in their gameplay or story. That's just how it is in gaming. [i]The Sims 4[/i] should have been allowed an additional year of development to work out some of the little issues here and there, but still shines despite its flaws.\n\n Of course, this is not a first-person shooter, a platform game, a fighting game, or even an RPG, which can be evaluated properly in 10 or fewer hours of play. This game is the type which requires at least 15 hours just to start scratching the surface and must be played for 60-70 hours just to formulate a proper review! There are so many aspects to the game in its gameplay, so many features and branching paths that one cannot just give up after 5 hours and say, ""This game sucx. Where's my pool?"" So, if you buy this game or have it given to you as a gift, just give it 15-20 hours and make a few different types of households to try out different things. If it doesn't grab you during that experimental phase, then this isn't the game for you...but if it does, say goodbye to your free time!\n\nMy Score: 4/5 and 8.5/10. Even with the bugs and the things that didn't make the final cut for the base game release, it's a good game. 0.25 of the 1 point off of the 5-point score and the 0.5 of the 1.5 points off of the 10-point score is for the lack of a physical instruction manual in the Limited Edition physical copy. It's a $60 game and I expect a 12-page black-and-white booklet that gives me the basic controls of the game. I'm old-fashioned like that.";The Sims 4: A Thorough Review
172;378.0;3.0;6.0;I was really excited to know that The Sims 4 was being released earlier than their advertised December 31 date. However, when I read the reviews once the game was out and I was still waiting on my preorder, I groaned internally. While there are a lot of good things about the game I like, I do miss a bunch of stuff that came with Sims 2 and 3 base games, like toddlers(I can't believe they took them out!), the directional buttons, and MORE lots. I love the CAS--but I just can't believe you have only 4 lots you can play, with only two towns to play these Sims in. I really like to create sims, so I was stuck with how limited I was to having them have houses. I'm hoping the future expansion packs, or even some patches, will bring some more neighborhoods so you can actually create familes and move them in. I do miss the open world concept as well that the Sims 3 brought, but I do like the fact they can travel and it not lag my computer. It's a fun game, and I like the Sims' different emotional states, but I really think that I overpaid for this game.;While there are a lot of good things about the game I like
178;379.0;2.0;6.0;This game is almost good. I deleted Sims 3 before downloading this and wish I would have just waited and kept playing Sims 3 until reviews came out. The demo for CAS is what got me though. I wasn't going to get it because the amount of glitches and just poor programming keeps getting worse, but I thought the CAS was really well done so I bought it as soon as it was released. Waste of money. If you want to play a decent Sims, play 3, although I think 2 was probably the best so far. It has potential I guess, but I also know they won't put in the work to make that happen. VERY disappointing.;Don't bother, Keep playing 3
180;380.0;1.0;6.0;The sims 4 would not load up onto my computer. It was very slow and finally after 2 days of down loading , it came to a standstill. I've never had any trouble with any other sims game exept this one. The way they have it set up is a complete diaster. I will be trying for a refund. I wouldnt even give this game one star.;The sims 4 would not load up onto my computer ...
46;381.0;1.0;5.0;I received Sims 4 for Christmas in 2014. I have given it a full year of game play, but I really do not like it.  I am a Sims fan (some would say fanatic) since the beginning.  Frankly, I would rather play Sims 1, 2 or 3 instead of this version.  I find the game play boring and do not like the static screens when switching neighborhoods. There is not much for my Sims to do and it is difficult to meet other Sims and really get to know them.  And I do not like the limitations with designing and decorating a house (or the Sims clothes).  Another reviewer used the word heartbreaking - that is exactly how I feel as well.\n\nAfter a  year of trying to give Sims 4 a fair, fighting chance, I have now abandoned the game and have went back to playing Sims 3.;Disappointing and heartbreaking...
194;382.0;3.0;6.0;I love the Sims games, but this one doesn't seem to have nearly enough advances from The Sims 3 to constitute an entire new game. Still a lot of fun, but I probably would have been better off just saving the money and continuing to play 3 instead. But I guess we'll see what other content might get released in time.;Not different enough from earlier generations
227;383.0;4.0;6.0;I think most people here are just mad because it is not the same as the Sims 3. Seriously, you make the game the same and people knock you for copy and pasting the last game, but you make it different and everyone is pissed because it's different than the last one. Anyways, I read the reviews of this game after my brother had purchased it. He said he didn't like it and most people on here said the same. Most people were complying about these new loading screens or the lack of open world. When I went into this game today, from first glance I had a similar opinion to everyone else. But I wasn't going to judge it by first appearances like this neighborhood crap or the loading screens, no, I went deeper into this game and played for a good two hours and concluded that this game is more of an upgrade than a downgrade. Yeah, they have loading screens. But the loading screen is 5-10 seconds long and didn't cut into my expirience at all. There weren't as many jobs in this game as the Sims 3, but the amount of buyable furniture and items in my opinion greatly outweighed the jobs. All of the buildings like resuraunts, fitness clubs, dance clubs, and everything else in the last one is here in the Sims 4. Cars have been subtracted due to the loading screens, but you really don't notice it as it doesn't make a huge difference. I think the most impressive thing though is the polish put on this game. The Sims 3 was notorious for being buggy and laggy which I certainly experienced, but this game is very good looking graphic wise and is as smooth as any other game out there. All of this negativity is just stupid because if you give it some time, it can be a better expirience than the previous game.;Not as bad as people make it out to be
229;384.0;4.0;6.0;I played my friends version at his house and as soon as the Mac version is released I will buy it.\n\nI HATED the sims 3. I am still waiting for a refund for it. The open world was a STUPID idea, the graphics sucked.\nEverything about the sims 4 is exactly what I wanted from the series. It is everything the sims 3 SHOULD have been.\nYes I am sad that there is only a few lots but the new building mode really takes the chore our of rebuilding a house.\n\nI never like toddlers, I thought it was a stupid age group with almost no benefit to the game. I mean really if they don't learn how to walk, talk or use the toilet they grow up to be completely normal adults? I mean honestly.\nAs for pools, I never used them. They were only good for killing sims, besides that they just took up extra space i could have used for my house.\n\nI felt the emotions were a nice addition. They add a new depth to the game and create crazy new behaviors. They make the sims feel more alive. For crying out loud one of my sims got bored from watching kids shows while the other was enjoying it!\n\nThis game makes the sims act like individuals now, they are not cookie cutter mindless boring creatures that always react the same way to the same stimuli. Now their mood makes the react differently to stimuli.\n\nI give it 8/10 total. It would be 9 if there was at least a hint of the OSX version, but i understand they are trying to get the windows version working right under the new engine.\n\nThis game reminds me of everything I loved about the sims 1 and 2. EA really lost a customer when they released the sims 3.\nThe sims 4 is a step in the right direction to earning my trust back.\n\nKeep up the great work Maxis! I am glad you guys are back making the sims again and not that weird offshoot company!;The sims 4 is a really good game, reminds me of everything the game series should be. The sims 3 shouldn't have even existed!
231;385.0;5.0;6.0;I love Sims 4. There is a lot of unlocking that you have to do which adds a little bit harder then the brainless play that you just tend to control someone's life.\n\nI love that I can go anywhere and just add items to the lounge and bar.  There is a slight exploration to sims 4 where you can still find hidden treasures just not as expansive as sims 3 was. There are a few glitches momentarily but I am sure that the 'patchers' will fix them soon. I love that there are more job opportunities.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.;I love Sims 4
242;386.0;4.0;6.0;Great foundation for a series. Really worth playing on normal, not high, speed, and close up. The detail of animation in Sims' interactions is fabulous! Much less glitchy than Sims 3 as well. Looking forward to expansions and world additions.;Great foundation for a series
256;387.0;5.0;6.0;Sims 4 is honestly the best simulation ever. Sure EA took a lot of features away.. But they did add a lot of new content. And they still have 10+ expansions they will be releasing and you can't forget patches/updates too.\n\nEA changed the graphics to more of a sims 2 style/look and changed the concept of the world so you travel between different sections. Which is amazing because sims 3 was such a buggy game that it was hardly unplayable at sometimes. With the freezing and the crashing caused from the game loading more than it can handle/not having a good enough PC.. The gameplay also feels a lot more smooth in my opinions. Sims 3 had awkward animations that just didint look right.. Like walking, eating, Etc. Like they would pause before doing anything and awkwardly step into place.\n\nNow let's talk about the sims... They  look fantastic.. I was never a fan of what the sims looked like in sims 3.. But this style.. In my opinions it is more detailed than sims 3 on different ways.. It looks smoother and the terrain looks amazing.. Once you look through the few flaws of this game.. You will realize how truly amazing it really is. This account says a different name so I will sign with mine.\n\n- Hunter\n4.5/5 stars.. Great game. Nice Job EA.;LOVE IT.. it has flaws.. But there will be a lot of expansions. It's only the beginning.
257;388.0;1.0;6.0;Not much to do, lots taken out.  Performance issues even though loading screens and smaller worlds were supposed to combat this. Sims look great, but I'll be sticking to the Sims 4 for now.;Sims look great, but I'll be sticking to the Sims 4 ...
281;389.0;5.0;6.0;By far the best Sims to date. I have been playing The Sims since the very beginning, and admittedly there are some things missing here that I have to assume are missing purely to be introduced via expansion, but that doesn't bother me really, it's par for the course with The Sims games in general. The lack of open world and family tree is not an issue for me. If you are a fan of the sims, give it an honest shot and throw out your preconceived notions and remember this is a BASE GAME all over  again. None of the previous generations were fully fledged at base launch either. If you are new to The Sims, this is definitely a good time to get into it because it's never been easier to get into. I don't write many reviews but with all the hate being spewed here I felt it was necessary.;Fantastic
329;390.0;5.0;6.0;Worth the money!!! I love it!!!!!!;Glad I bought it!
370;391.0;5.0;6.0;I'm not sure why all the hate. I too have played every game, every expansion since day one. Sure it's different, but if it was the same what would be the point? ? I think it has tons of potential ahead too. I do miss the open world, but other than that I don't see anything to gripe about;a good start
374;392.0;4.0;6.0;i won't lie the premium edition is not worth the extra dough but overall i am really having fun. The controls took some getting used to and i was a bit nostalgic when i'd go do something only to discover it's not there. However, I also laughed like never before with a sims game at the unique interactions - which depend on my sim's mood - and find myself exploring the neighborhood so much more (despite not being open world) b/c  there're actually sims there ready to mingle. The socialization tweaks made are great - sims can now talks in groups, while doing other things, and across the room if necessary (i.e. you can pump iron and talk to the guy 5 feet away on the treadmill). I thought I'd miss create-a-style most but each objects comes with some pattern options which helps to keep things from being too cookie cutter. everyone seems to be complaining about the changes but if you want sims 3 features, than PLAY sims 3 - but let's face it sims 3 is all about stuff and less about friends and romance. the point of a 'new' game is changes and so far I am enjoying the differences.;you shouldn't hate a game just b/c it's different people!
49;393.0;5.0;5.0;"For reference, I am a long-time fan of the Sims, since the original (I feel the need to mention this since so many negative reviews like to start off by saying they're hardcore fans and if you're ""like them"" that you should skip this title...). If I had to rank the series, I would rank it as: Sims 4 >  Sims 3 > > Sims > >  Sims 2.\n\nPros (in no particular order)\n-Art style/UI: Maxis has developed such a lovely and fitting style for the Sims 4. They're achieved a great balance between bright, colorful, fun, mature, simple and nuanced. The sims look good (and unique from one another without needing to have an extreme facial feature..), the world is gorgeous and everything has a nice streamlined look to it. The animations are on point and very well done.\n\n-Create a sim: There is so much more customizability for how your sim-bodies and sim-faces look now than ever before. This was a pretty big issue for me in the Sims 3, everyone looked way too similar unless they had some exceptionally strange feature. The hair, the clothes, the accessories and the like have a nice variety, are all really good looking and will actually be used unlike previous base games. Little things like boots fitting to the pair of pants you're wearing and hats being wearable on every hairstyle are also fantastic upgrades. Making multiple outfits for a given category (i.e. everyday) means the sim will automatically rotate through the outfits by themselves. All of the clothing is maternity enabled.\n\n-Building: Building is much easier to do now and quite effortless to adjust as needed during your building. Things like the ability to make objects larger, taller walls, roofing, move stuff freely on the wall, etc. are all great. Not to mention all the bonuses that you get with the new move objects cheat such as moving objects up and down. There are also really great search and filter functions. The filter is nowhere near as slow as the sims 3.\n\n-Skills: There are 20 adult skills in total in the base game: Charisma, Comedy, Cooking, Gourmet cooking, fishing, fitness, gardening, guitar, handiness, woodworking, logic, mischief, mixology, painting, piano, programming, rocket science, video gaming, violin, writing. Compare this to 6, 7 and 10 found in Sims, Sims 2 and Sims 3 base games respectively. Needless to say, there is quite a lot to do and explore! Not to mention, theres quite a lot of collecting to do, too  rocks, gems, fossils, crystals, etc.\n\n-The town is alive. I have played through many generations in several saves, and the town remains fully alive, with lots of sims of varying ages all around. Just walking down the sidewalk/paths around your house, doing things when you visit public lots, etc.. there are lots of sims to interact with! They age and die, but there is an automatic repopulating that happens (new families are created and allowed to move in or just be townies automatically). Story progression (even how flawed it was) is an amazing feature of the Sims 3, but it was quite a common occurrence for public places to just be.. barren in the Sims 3.. not so in the Sims 4.\n\n-Flushed out life children. Children are no longer as useless as they were in previous games (unless you had the expansion packs to give them more character and such). Children are well developed with a healthy amount of content for them to do.. which is fantastic. Id rather have well developed children than mediocre-children and mediocre-toddlers that we got in the Sims 3 base game (and even with expansions toddlers were still pretty meh to me  and Im a family style player, for reference).\n\n-Aspirations/Lifetime Rewards: These have changed quite a bit from Sims 3. You are free to switch aspirations as you play (and Id even recommend that so you can complete them both at the same time) without losing progress. They are broken down into 4 steps with various requirements to fulfill. Finishing a given aspiration will give your sim a new trait. There are a few aspirations exclusive to children and the traits you gain from that will carry on to adulthood.\n\n-Multitasking: Need I say more?\n\n-Emotions/whims: Another significant change from Sims 3, which was a significant change from the sims 2. Wishes are now replaced by whims  3 of which exist at once  one that is emotion based, and two that are not. You can pin the two that are not emotion based to prevent them from disappearing. Emotions are quite fun to play with, and being in a particular mood will give benefits to certain sorts of skill building or the like. The emotions are fine (neutral), happy, confident, energized, flirty, focused, inspired, playful, angry, bored, dazed, embarrassed, tense, uncomfortable and sad. The emotions add a lot of character and fun interactions to the sims, and make them seem so much more alive. Im more connected to my sims than any previous game (though sims 3 is still close, sims and sims 2 are just blown out of the water). Relationships are more complex, and things are more unpredictable now.\n\n-Neighborhoods/Worlds: A very nice middle ground between being constricted to a single lot yet still being able to explore the world, albeit not Sims-3-style. Theres plenty of ground to cover and explore, yet not enough to cause too much instability in the game engine/code and make sure the game runs smoothly. A huge plus to the new world system is that you will not run out of space for expansion content. A new expansion? Well, theres a new world that you can travel to and get all of the expansion content! No need to worry about deleting houses, placing awkward lots, or the like.\n\nGameplay in general: Long story short, I just find myself enjoying the amount of content, the emotions and my sims so much more than in previous iterations of the game, which is quite impressive for a base game and will only be improved upon with future expansions. Bottom line, the game is fun to play, its fun to explore. Its fun to have specific goals (follow the career, aspirations, etc.) and its fun to just roll with the punches and let your sims do their own thing. This game is very different than the Sims 3, just as the Sims 3 is very different than the Sims 2 (and boy did it get a lot of hate for being so, though thats kind of forgotten nowadays or people are just too young/too new to the series to know any better). Im personally glad it is different, because I don't want more of the same, I want to see growth and progress in the series, and the Sims 4 has done a wonderful job at doing so.\n\nCons (to some people at least)\n-No Create-a-style. If the only reason you played the Sims 3 was for the CaSt feature, you'll be disappointed. However, the Sims 4 does have plenty of color choices to choose from, so its not that bad of a thing! (I actually prefer just having lots of presets so I don't feel like I have to use CaSt to have things look nice).\n\n-No toddlers. Im fine with this because toddlers got pretty boring in the Sims 3 after playing it so much. I do hope for a family-themed expansion that gives us *well developed* toddlers, though.\n\n-No open world. Still have neighborhoods, which is fine, but it is unfortunate having to load up a lot when you want to visit. Thankfully the loading screens are short and sweet.\n\n-Map display. Its kind of lack luster. It gets the job done, but its nothing special.\n\n-No grocery stores. Its not a big deal, but I wish you could just buy a variety of food and store it in the fridge. Instead, you have to pay for each meal as you make it.\n\nADDED IN UPDATES: Pools (which can be built on any floor now), geneology (family tree), influence the gender of a baby via eating certain fruit/listening to certain music, half walls, door locking, an empty world (Newcrest), moveobjects, a couple careers, paid time off for work, family leave, ghosts, ability to ""paint from reference"" (family portraits, landscapes, etc), new eye colors and basements have all been patched in. To change a sims last name, go to a dresser, plan outfit, then click their name in the upper left corner and you should have the ability to change their name. Its very easy for people to focus on the negatives, since that is what resonates most with us and that is what the internet is best at delivering. You don't see people who are satisfied with games (not just the sims) flooding the forums or reviews with tons of positive feedback because they are playing the game and enjoying it. If you enjoy the Sims franchise, this is a solid release and well worth it, don't let the negativity get to you! ";Lovely continuation of the franchise.
51;394.0;2.0;5.0;I am not a fan. I uninstalled 4 and went back to 3.;Two Stars
58;395.0;5.0;5.0;This game has gotten a lot of hate from longtime simmers, and honestly, I don't see why. I have played and loved both the sims 2 and 3, and have many expansions for both. I think the sims 4 is just as fun. Many say that it is watered down, but I really don't think it has any less to offer than the original sims 3. I can tell you before I had any expansion packs that the create a sim hairstyles and clothing were VERY limited. In comparison, the sims 4 create a sim is so much better I can hardly tell you. This makes me incredibly happy since this has always been one of my favorite parts.\n  Here is where a few of the negative things come into play, as a few things that have been taken away. Now, there are loading screens whenever you travel because it isn't an open world. However, I don't find this all that annoying (especially when the sim 3 I had a solid 15 minute loading screen). There aren't any toddlers, which I couldn't care less about. I never liked that life stage. The most disappointing thing is the lack of create a style. There are just a few things that I want in a color that isn't available. Once you get used to it isn't so bad. It may be a good thing for me since I spent so much time nitpicking so that everything matched perfectly. Other things that had been missing have been released in patches (family trees, pools, ghosts, basements, etc.). Some people also argue that the sims look to cartoony. I LOVE the new style though (I mean think about it. Wouldn't be a little creepy if they looked super realistic? It doesn't even fit this game at all).\n  Now for the good news. The game runs great, even on my laptop. It hasn't crashed once, which is more than I can say for the sims 3. This sims 4 runs like butter. The sims 3 was more like gravel. The new emotions are great, and the sims seem more alive. Even with fewer traits, they seem to have more personality. I always found it so annoying that there could be a huge space, and the sims couldn't go through, or how long it took someone to move out of the way. With the sims 4 you won't have that problem. Which is so nice. They can also multitask now, which is very nice. Everything just feels better. Plus, the most important thing, I think this game is FUN. I mean lacking or not(which I don't think it is), THAT is what I care about. In fact, with no expansion packs, it is the most fun sim games in my opinion. In the end, that is all that really matters. With new expansion packs coming out, it will be even better! I can hardly wait for pets!\n  So is this game worth it? I think it completely depends on the person. For me? Definitely. Some longtime simmers just can't get over no toddlers, cars, create a style, or open world. If you're a simmer and can look over those things, this is a game you will definitely enjoy. For anyone new to the series, pick it up, you won't regret it.;Highly Underrated. Great Game!
60;396.0;3.0;5.0;Don't bother ordering this disk.  I can't speak to the gameplay because I haven't actually played it, but with respect to the actual install of this game, the disk is no use.  You will still have to download EA's origin platform and then download the game on each PC that you want to play this on.  You can do the same by purchasing this from EA for $10 less.  All you get with this disk is an additional wait for shipping time and the activation code.  The download itself takes approximately 5 hours and will eat your bandwidth while you wait.\n\nAdditionally, I will warn that multiple users cannot play from a single purchase of this game at once, at least not at full capacity.  I bought this because both my son & I like the Sims and we play separately. Unlike Sims 3 and previous versions, you can only register the game to one user that can be online at a time.  I read on some forums that a user can play offline while another plays online, but we've not been able to finagle this arrangement as the origin platform is not all that user-friendly.  There's a long story that I won't bother with about how it took me days to even get origin installed on my Mac and the hours that I spent with a handful of useless origin support staff.\n\nIf you like the sims, don't let this keep you from trying the newest installment, but buy the download directly from EA and save yourself some time & money.;Don't spend extra time or $ on the hard copy
69;397.0;4.0;5.0;I love all of these complainers. People hated Sims 2 when it first came out. People hated Sims 3 when it came out. Now people hate Sims 4 and say how much better Sims 2 and 3 are. Folks, don't you think that maybe the problem isn't the game that it is YOU???;I love all of these complainers
71;398.0;1.0;5.0;Any time I do want to play it, Origin is updating and I have to wait 2 hours (which means I rarely play). It is ridiculous how long the Origin updates take and how much it impacts my ability to play when I want. I really wish I could have a refund. Besides all that, as many have said, this game has so little to over compared to Sims 2 and Sims 3. I have had it for 6 months and only played 2 hours of game play.;Any time I do want to play it, Origin ...
72;399.0;3.0;5.0;"As someone who's been playing the sims since the release of the Sims 2, I have to say that I'm disappointed in this game. It seems that the developers have taken a few step backwards than forwards. I just want to go over a few pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are great\nYour sims are more customizable\nHome decorating is easier with the ""buy a room"" option\nYour sim can now take a pregnecey test which helps them find out if your attempt at conception was successful much faster than in the last game.\nI think that's about it....\n\nCons:\nYou can no longer have free roam around the city that we were all very excited that the Sims 3 gave us. Developers have stepped back all the way to the Sims 2 and gives us a loading screen everytime we wish to travel somewhere else in the neighborhood and cars are no longer an option to buy\n\nNeighborhoods are smaller giving us less places to live and build\n\nThere is no longer a toddler stage for kids :(\nI was so heartbroken when raising my first child in this game. When the infant stage was over I was so excited to see what the toddler phase would bring but was horribly disappointed when the infant leaped from the crib and was a full blown child. why would you guys get rid of the toddler stage?!?\n\nYou now have to pay for every meal you make. A sure fire way to go broke unless you repeatedly use the mother load cheat.\n\nYou can no longer see an actual person when hiring services like the maid or babysitter. Whenever you save out of the game and reeneter you see the minus $ sign and a note saying that the maid has cleaned up.\n\nThe game has just taken a lot of steps back and it makes me wonder what the hell the developers were thinking when creating this game. I'D rather play the sims 3. Hopefully with future expansion packs developers will return some of the old perks. My biggest one being free roam.";I'd rather play the Sims 3
73;400.0;1.0;5.0;What a great dissapointment, I played the Sims since they first came out. I own all the games. But Dont get tricked by the great graphics and the nice adds. I expected more from the game. First of all, the fact that you won't have baby's and toddlers makes the game pretty boring. Takes you away from reality. Whoever designed the game didn't take in consideration than a huge percentage of the people that play the game are women! Then on the sims 3 you could travel with your vehicle to any locations right? Now it takes forever to go to a location and you have to wait for the screen to pop up and take you there. The graphics are great but there are a lot of things missing! It feels like you are inside a cartoon, it lost its reality feeling of the sims. The locations are small. There are not many places to build or go. I keep playing the sims 2 and 3 and wish I could still get back my money. I literally played for 2 days and I hated after that. The only fun I had was creating the characters. On create your sims. That's all.;What a great dissapointment, I played the Sims since they first ...
74;401.0;1.0;5.0;I don't understand what the disc was for!!  Had to still download it from the internet which literally took HOURS!! Bought it for my daughter and wish i hadn't.  Waste of money.  Can't even play it on her pc sometimes.;BLAH!!!
75;402.0;3.0;5.0;"This game more of a ""Sims for dummies"" game. I mainly like to build and a lot of features are not in this version that was in Sims 3. No split level stairs (not even with cheats) and no creat a style. The create a sim feature is weird: while you can tweak details of a person, you are stuck with very few options on personality, interests, and clothing options. I hope their expansion packs bring some improvements but at $39 a pop, you're better off playing Sims 3.";Makes me miss Sims 3
78;403.0;3.0;5.0;Now I understand what the reviews were about. I've been a die-hard Sims fan since the original Sims 1 and have all the games and expansion packs. Sims 4 pales in comparison to the previous versions. Both Sims 2 and 3 are way better. Sims 4 has nice graphics and character creation, but they've stripped the game down so much that there is little to do. It makes the game boring until more content could be added. It's actually very disappointing. I'm glad I waiting for the $29.99 sale, but it's not even worth that much. I'd say it's more worth around $19.99. Very disappointing...I hope that future Sims games improve. I was looking forward to being impressed...not this time.;Disappointing...doesn't even compare to Sims 2 or 3
83;404.0;3.0;5.0;This really deserves only 1 star but if you're like me you only read the 3 stars. The sims that you can create do look great but thats about all this has going for it. You can't customize the houses like you can in Sims 3 and using the prebuilt rooms is a pain in the rear. You can't do anything while your sim is at work except just sit there and look around. Switching between households may be easier but it seems to be a headache to change to me. I don't loose wishes but everything else is a headache. Over all I hate this game and will be sending it back to get my money back. I'll use the money to buy a Sims3 expansion I don't have. Save your money and buy a new sims3 expansion.;Disappointing....
87;405.0;1.0;5.0;"I got to try this game out, it was very disappointing.  Sure its great you can customize the way a Sim walks, but really that's it?  I think I played it for all of 10 minutes.  I got annoyed at the loading screens, the fact that I cannot see the entire town. It is like instead of progressing, they took giant leaps backwards.  It feels as if Sims 4 should have came before Sims 3 and Sims 3 is the ""new"" version of the game.  It would've been a great game.  With multi-tasking and having ""smarter"" sims.  EA has a LONG way to go to actually make this game good.  I feel like they should pull it from the shelves, and start from scratch taking everyones ideas and complaints into consideration.  It makes me wonder if this was a ""I wonder how bad we can make the upgrades and still get people to buy this game"" kind of thing.  Like, they'll buy it anyways?  Hype it up so much, and watch people start buying it?  I am just glad I got to try it for free before spending any money on it!  For now, I will stick with Sims 3, at least that was a major jump from 2 to 3.";Not worth your time.
91;406.0;1.0;5.0;This game is a horrible waste of money and time. If you played the Sims 1, 2, 3, you'll find that this game falls well below expectations. I purchased this game with premium content and It's clear that the game designers tried to turn a PC game into a mobile app game. If you're into PC gaming forget this game because it's pay to play. Forget open worlds, forget key life stages, forget families, forget customization, forget creating your own worlds, forget playing the game the way you want, when you want. No creativity, no content, no vision and no direction in the Sims4 but lots and lots and lots and lots of loading screens. This company released and unfinished game at an obscene price and wants you to keep paying for content in hopes that the game play will actually entertain you. I lost 70.00 dollars, don't make the same mistake.;WASTE OF MONEY!
94;407.0;1.0;5.0;"I paid full price but, sadly, didn't try it out in time to get a refund.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews I read - my bad.\n\nI played it for several hours, for several days, but there are a few major things that I hated about it and which made it a chore to play rather than fun.  When I play SIMS 3 I lose track of time and really enjoy myself.\n\nHere are my own personal reasons for not liking SIMS 4 at all:\n\n1) I feel claustrophobic in the tiny little neighborhood.\n\n2) I hate having to wait for screens to load when all I want to do is go out on the town to eat out.  I really enjoy being able to walk/jog/bike/drive all over town and visit businesses, parks, homes, without having to ever wait for things to load.\n\n3) The major flaw, for me: I can't fiddle with colors & patterns in clothes or furniture or anything.  As I understand it, that is never going to be an option in SIMS 4.  That is one of my 'biggie' fun things to do when playing SIMS 3.  I love fiddling with the looks of everything, getting it all to look 'just right'.\n\n4) Oh, another huge annoyance in SIMS 4: When I take one Sim out of the neighborhood, none of the others are accessible.  In SIMS 3, unless I travel to another COUNTRY like China, Egypt or France, I can go all over town & do lots of different things - and control ALL of my SIMS simultaneously.  (I'm a control freak, as you have probably guessed by now.)\n\nSo, thank heavens SIMS 3 is still alive and well.  This is where I'll be playing.  A resounding ""NO!"" to SIMS 4, for me.";SIMS 4 is not for me...
97;408.0;1.0;5.0;Don't waste your money because that is all EA wants--your money! The Sims 4 is The Sims 1 with better graphics. Btw - I have played it on a 64 bit computer without any technical problems yet, but the specs on the box state that it is designed for 32 bit.;Keep Your Money in Your Pocket
112;409.0;1.0;5.0;My boyfriend got this for me for Christmas, and it won't even work on my computer. At first, it loaded and there were white and purple lines all over everything. With it being a new game, I didn't know where the buttons were, so the lines were a horrible mess. I looked up how to get rid of the lines (and used the sims website) and did exactly what the website did, and now my computer is completely ruined. There's pop ups, it won't load the Internet, and I can't even play the sims 3 anymore. I am so disappointed. I was so excited to finally get my hands on the game, especially since I loved the sims 3 so much, but now, I'm upset that my bf spent his money on this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!;dont waste your money on this!
115;410.0;1.0;5.0;Bought this game on sale from origin and wish i hadn't. Buy sims 3.\n\nIt feels like i am playing sims 2 again just with more cartoonish graphics. the open map of sims 3 was by far the best thing the series had going for it. sims has been cut down into something that almost feels like a browser game there are very few lot and house choices and those that are there are no good. there are loading screens between anything you want to do. i used to love wandering around town finding new places to fish and try to fill my collection. now there are a couple fishing spots where you have to click a sign. there is also no real style creator only a handful of colour combonations. all in all im very disappointed;Bought this game on sale from origin and wish i hadn't. Buy sims 3.
120;411.0;1.0;5.0;Very disappointed in Sim4....it is like stepping back in this game years.  There are no real cities just neighborhoods and few of them.  If you are a Sims3 fan do not buy this thinking it is any kind of improved version of 3 because it is not.;DISAPPOINTED IN SIM4
121;412.0;1.0;5.0;There is a mandatory download/update they make you do. It doesn't load and restricts you from playing the game. Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!;TERRIBLE
122;413.0;4.0;5.0;I bought mine at Best Buy with a gift card, so I lost no money here.\n\nAt first, I was disappointed in the lack of content, but as I began to play it more and more, it grew on me. Sure, it does not seem like much now, but this game has potential to go far. First, I really like the multitasking feature. It is super helpful when you want to achieve an objective while at the same time taking care of the sim's needs. I like the social event features as well. Before when I would host a party in sims 3, only like ten sims would come, but now I can upwards to 30 sims at a time in my house. Now that's a party! I like that child sims can improve on skillsets of their own that would later translate to skillsets used by teens and adults. Also, for those who have not played or have just started, just wait til you discover the two hidden worlds within the base game. They are beautiful and epic! Secondly, I love the new CAS. I have been waiting for a CAS that would take me as far as this one did. And despite the lack of content upon purchase, there is a lot you can unlock! And bonus, the starter clothing and furniture is not crappy!\n\nNow onto the negatives. The worlds are tiny, your sim can no longer own cars and no toddlers. All are pretty devastating negative points, but I expect EA will make up for it with DLCs and expansions that are (hopefully) not exorbitantly priced. I recommend that people who do have it, just give it some time. EA is coming out with FREE DLCs that will hopefully improve the game's quality.;I bought mine at Best Buy with a gift card
130;414.0;3.0;5.0;"I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so... I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant ""popping"" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise, unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)\n\n(edited: the gameplay itself is fun and it delivers in that aspect. I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)";Advent Simmer
132;415.0;2.0;5.0;It was super boring...Nothing like Sims 3. I was highly disappointed;Boring- Not Worth the Money
135;416.0;3.0;5.0;"It's just OK. As an avid player of The Sims, I could not wait to get this game! After running it for an hour, I was bored. The graphics are more ""cartoony"" than The Sims 3 (TS3), the customization of the home and the items in the home is similar to The Sims 2 which is WAY below TS3. Create a sim mode is more detailed as far as facial features go, but in clothing and personality it's really lacking.\n\nIf you go back and play TS3 base with no custom content or expansions, it's way better that TS4. It really sucks that it doesn't include toddlers & swimming pools.\n\nOverall, I will keep playing it. The cheats available are nice and the game itself runs smooth. I am looking forward to the expansion packs. Maybe they will cause me to increase my star rating.";Not as good as The Sims 3.
136;417.0;2.0;5.0;Why was I so happy when I bought this? I thought it was gonna rock! It sucks so much!\n\n- Its just like sims 2! You went years back! There isn't really a town and there aren't really jobs.\n\n- The sims look like cartoons. Sims 3 had great detail, this looks like clay.\n\n- Confusing with the inventory. I don't know if anyone else had this problem but i kept getting confuse on where is what.\n\n- the doors and walls are unrealistically tall\n\nIn my opinion they did horribly. The only thing i liked about it was the walking and more children outfits thats it! They shouldve stuck with expansion packs for sims 3. I hope this review helped;EA tricked me!
141;418.0;4.0;5.0;I am confused at the terrible reviews of this game. I have loved the sims since the first one came out. I have purchased all EPs and enjoyed and hated them for what they were.\nHowever, though the sims 4 is far from perfect (anyone remember the buggy mess that is sims 3?), the game has it's merits. Though the emotions are not fantastic, the sims are much more alive. Though cutting is bad, pretty sure I've seen my sims in sims 3 walk through each other and sometimes stand there tapping their foot for thirty sim minutes. I'll take some arm cutting a counter if it means not losing a sim half hour to foot tapping.\nI wish they gave us more normal careers but we are getting a patch on Dec 1 with some more!\nCAS is awesome! I love it way more than I loved any other CAS. Pro of CAS: the ability to truly customize sims. Con: would love more hair styles.\n\nI love the new aspiration system. I love checking off boxes to try and meet my goals!\n\nI just cannot fathom how people who haven't played rate the game and people complain about a base game when EA has never made a good Pet EP but people were sad that pets were not in the base game.\n\nI could truly go on for a long time about every great thing, but truly this is a wonderful game and again as more EPs are added we will have even more to do.;The sims 4
145;419.0;1.0;5.0;EA games have a tendency to be highly expensive.  They charge you the entire game for updates done to the same game.;We deserve unique new games

203;423.0;4.0;5.0;As a person who has only played Sims 1 and 2 previously, I am really liking the game. I was a bit worried with all the negative reviews, but I'm glad I went ahead and ordered anyway. The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth, and I'm having a lot of fun with it. There are a few glitches that I've seen, but nothing detrimental as of yet. I am looking forward to some expansion packs because I do agree with the reviews that say there is a lack of content. There's enough to keep me busy right now, but would love more.;Enjoying the game
212;424.0;5.0;5.0;As someone who thought The Sims 3 was so overly complex and time consuming that it couldn't be considered a casual game as compared to The Sims 1 & 2.  I've played The Sims from the very beginning and have always loved the concept of The Sims.  This installment, #4, is everything I've wanted from The Sims from the beginning.\n\nGone are the days that you'd have to wait for your sims to sleep through the night, it takes 15 seconds in The Sims 4, they use the restroom and shower just once per day, I love the cooking options menu, the relationship bar of romance vs friendship is very simple and easy to understand, your sims ambitions are a little more detailed now, for example:  instead of being a love sim who plays everybody as in The Sims 3, you can choose to be a soul-mate sim who wants to find one true love.\n\nI see a lot of potential for this game in later expansions.  The base game is brilliant!  I can already see myself spending hours of my days on this game... I couldn't say the same for The Sims 3 which sat unplayed for weeks after purchased.\n\nI don't care that I can't change the texture of my furniture, I don't miss the toddlers because I always thought they were an unnecessary part of the game that just took valuable time from my adult sims.  The smaller neighborhood doesn't bother me because it allows me to focus on a few families rather than get sidetracked by 10+.  Not to mention the loading time is cut in half!\n\nMaxis made a beautiful game and I believe it is only a matter of time before the reviews balance out and it is given it's rightful 4-5 star rating.;Enjoyable, casual game.  Best Sims series yet!
217;425.0;3.0;5.0;Where is everything? Features missing all over the place. Don't buy, or at least not yet.;Wheres the beef?
233;426.0;5.0;5.0;I totally disagree with all the negative reviews. How could you not love this game? It runs smoother and faster than Sims 3 and it's made for people who don't have expensive gaming machines which makes it less frustrating and easier to play. So, this game is worth 5 stars in my book.;Great Game!
247;427.0;5.0;5.0;I have only had a few hours to review this game.  I have to review because of all the bad reviews on the new version are so unwarranted.  Sims 3 for me had a lot of good to it but it had a lot of bad with it too.  When I went to Sims 3 from Sims 2, there was so much good in Sims 2 that I missed in Sims 3.  What a breath of fresh air in this game.  I have only had a few hours and only in the build mode....I have to say...finally finally the graphics and the content is totally awesome.  I have not even played the game but the more I work in the game the more satisfied of the money that I purchased.  I purchased it because of such a mix review base that I had to see for myself.  There was a review that said it was, yes a lot like Sims 2 with and upgraded feeling.  Yes it is.  I am sure Maxis and EA games will hopefully bring back the customizations that makes this game as successful as it is.  But there is so much more to learn that it may take me 6 months to learn this game before the first expansion pack comes out.  There are things I don't like about this game but the good out weighs the back.  I have to figure out how to operate the mouse to rotate and scroll around.  It is a bit cumbersome.  But I guess that will take some getting used to.  My daughter has been playing it and enjoying herself.  The build and buy mode has much improved!!!!  FINALLY!!!!  Sims 3 to me had nothing but junk.  The other thing FINALLY the windows can be placed up and down the wall.  They have different size doors...tall, medium and small.  The pictures are hung on the wall freely anywhere....YES, GROUPINGS!!!  The plants in Sims 3 always came through the walls from my landscaping.  Sims 2 plants are back...YES!!!!  HALLALUAH!!!  The topiaries...llama and an elephant.  Bonsai tree.  Pillar Cactus!!!  It is soooooo fricking nice to see Sims 2 content!!!  I can't wait to play the game but I am too busy in the build and buy mode!  I hope they bring back the custom content...I am sure this is a marketing ploy of EA Games/Maxis.  But that is business.  They have to be able to pay the programmers to keep us Simmers happy!  I highly recommend giving this game a chance and check it out yourself before you listen to all the negative reviews.\n\nOne last thing...thank you EA Games for the changes in the build mode on the Roof.  OMG...keep up the great changes!!!  You rock my world!!!!\n\nI have been a simmer for well over 10 years.  My first sim game was Sim City.  Then Sim 1, Sim 2 and Sim3.  Now Sim4!!!;EA GAMES has Rocked my Sims Game World!!!!
302;428.0;5.0;5.0;Definitely worth the wait...its just a base game so of courae minimal content with great potential for awesome eps. Like the look and neighboorhood cant wait for the first ep and all the updates!;GREAT POTENTIAL
348;429.0;4.0;5.0;Not as bad as everybody is saying. Yes not a lot of furniture, but enough to furnish your entire house and also nice building features? No pool? Sucks but you can build a fountain that looks exactly like a pool. I hope they release more content soon and there is always custom content to download online from various websites.;Not that bad, but also not great
355;430.0;3.0;5.0;"The game is okay, but its nothing to rave about. They talk about building a great ""base"", but there's nothing all that great about it. There are major clipping issues in this game. The camera controls . . . I mean really? They couldn't make it simple and put some buttons on the screen? The UI takes some getting used to, but I'm not a fan of it. Especially since its clear. A nice blue color would have been nice. Gameplay is fun for the most part, all of my sims made me laugh out loud with their crazy antics, but I'm not going to lie, they didn't give this game what it should have gotten. If they knew time was going to be an issue in creating this game, GET MORE TIME TO DO IT RIGHT. Not half way. I didn't pay half way on my order, so don't give me a half game.";Its decent.
362;431.0;4.0;5.0;not sure why all the hate towards the sims 4. I too have played every game, every expansion. The sims 4 is something diffrent yea it has it faults,i really miss the open world,toddlers,story progression,pools and some other stuff which im sure you hear,but im sure it has potential ahead too. I've been playing for 5hours and im having so much fun i like the new emotions it adds a depth experience to this game. Im sure with patches,dlc,expansion's the sims 4 going to be a great game! All the people talking about expansions and dlc,what i know almost every game company charges for dlc and expansions now days.;Good game,but not great.

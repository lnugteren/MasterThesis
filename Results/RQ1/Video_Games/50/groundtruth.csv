37;1.0;5.0;355.0;"I have been an avid PC and console gamer for...well, as long as there have been PC and console games, and have probably played hundreds of the darn things over the last two decades, and I can comfortably say, that Bioshock, is one of the top two or three games I have ever played, and absolutely the best console game.\n\nIt's one of those rare games, that has all of what you love about a great game, with none of what annoys you. I realized, after about 10 hours of play, that absolutley nothing was ticking me off. If there was ever a game that got everything right, it's Bioshock.\n\nNormally, you hear much about a shooter having an ""absorbing story"", and you're just like: ""yeah, yeah, just shut up and let me shoot you"". But Bioshock, actually does. The bleak, dystopian world scenario is hardly new in gaming, but Bioshock puts a great twist on things; and the art-deco 1940's sci-fi world is very refreshing and incredibly rendered. If you are as sick as I am of endless hallways filled with crates, you are in for a helluva treat. Not only does this game look amazing, but the design is so good, and so original, that it really does ""absorb"" you.\n\nThe biggest suprise to me, was level of literacy, and period detail. This game wasn't really designed for modern kids, and certainly wasn't designed by one. The villian, an obvious nod to conceptual novelist Ayn Rand, ends up being more complex than the average ""evil rich corporate Republican"" guy we're all so sick of by now, and not only is the voice acting a-list quality, but they even speak pretty authentic 1940's dialogue, with accurate period inflection. If you watch an old movie from the 40's you'll notice that not only was the slang and colloquial language different, but so was the actual style of speech. The characters in Bioshock don't sound like modern mallrats in seersucker suits, they sound like people from the 40's. The sense of period is very accurate, moreso than most Hollywood films (although a ""German"" lady character has a very obiously Russian accent lol).\n\nEven the shooting, was fabulously fun. When I first started playing, I thought ""oh no..shooting old revolvers isn't fun."" But don't forget, even though Bioshock takes place in the 40's, it's still a sci-fi what-if adventure, and the assortment of weapons are a gas to use. And ""adventure"" is really accurate. Even though it's an FPS with a fair amount of bloody shooting, it really feels and plays more like an old Sierra adventure game than a Quake-style shooter. The plot matters in this game, unlike many others, and you spend more time exploring the amazing world and solving puzzles than actually shooting, so consider that a mild warning if you are a shooting ""rivethead"".\n\nBioshock is a very long game, but it was so addicting, that I played it almost non-stop for 4 days and finished it. I actually just rented it, because normally games that are centered on plot don't have a lot of replay value for me, but this one I can imagine playing over and over, so the lack of multi-player doesnt really matter to me here. I'll be buying this sucker as soon as payday hits.\n\nIn short, the hype around Bioshock is no hype. This game even killed Half-life and Halo for me, and that's saying a lot. Halo3 is going to have a helluva climb to even get near Bioshock, and i never thought I'd say that.\n\nTo wrap-up, even though much of Bioshock's conceptual nods and references will probably sail over the heads of most modern teen gamers, it won't matter a darn. They'll be to busy being knocked out by the best visual world and gameplay mechanics I've ever seen.";Wow
2;2.0;1.0;8.0;Bottom line is that if you are a fan of Hostel or Saw movies, you will likely LOVE this game....anyone remotely sane however should just pass this one by.\n\nI bought this game as a combo pack with Oblivion based so many great reviews on BOTH games thinking I was getting a fantastic deal.\n\nBioshock has got to be one of the most disturbing games I have ever seen. The sounds and music and random voices saying bizarre things throughout are unnerving to say the least. Then add in the environment which is a total mess and splattered with blood EVERYwhere. Next,the creepy characters that jump out at you from nowhere...I was caught off guard and startled into squealing way too many times for my liking!\nI got, maybe, 15% into the game when I decided I was done. The mental factor of facing all that gore and psychotic behavior proved to be too much for me. Besides which, I have two small children at home and could NOT play anytime they were awake or around.\nThe game play and storyline that I experienced worked well and I didn't really have trouble following the story or finding things...but the environment just so totally creeped me out I couldn't continue!;Disturbing, disgusting, and CREEPY beyond belief!
0;3.0;5.0;82.0;I thought Gears of War was a good game, but I believe Bioshock outdoes Gears of War on multiple levels.  First, the storyline is solid, I feel like I am participating in a self-directed movie, opposed to the typical experience of a weak storyline combining together sequences of violence.  Second, Bioshock is not about who has the biggest gun, there is an element of strategy not found in previous FPS games with the exception maybe of Gears of War.  Finally, the game is intuitive, easy to pickup.  I am not a big fan of FPS games, typically enjoying games like Civilization IV, however, this game is one big exception.;If you buy one game this year, make it this one.
48;4.0;5.0;67.0;Having a bit of hype surrounding it before it's release, BioShock does not disappoint one bit.  In fact, as far as first person shooters go, games rarely get any better than this.  BioShock takes the FPS to new levels thanks to it's brilliantly realized atmosphere and setting, and a story that is so engaging you'll think that you were playing an RPG.  Taking place in a secret underwater city called Rapture, you get put right in the middle as things go very, very wrong quite quickly, and it's up to you to save the day using a barrage of traditional weapons, and some newfound abilities as well.  What makes BioShock so great besides the atmosphere and storyline are the character customization options which really allow the gamer to get into the game and tinker around to your advantage.  The overall presentation, from the sound design to the wonderful voice acting to the grimy atmosphere, make BioShock one of the best games to hit the XBox 360 yet, and definitely one of the best FPS' to come out in quite some time.  If there's any downsides to BioShock, it's that the game has a lack of enemy variety and that it is a little too forgiving to the gamer.  Despite that though, BioShock is a masterpiece of modern gaming, and any and every 360 owner should consider this an essential pick up.;Game of the year - so far
10;5.0;1.0;52.0;"I really tried to like this game, but I couldn't get past the first few hours. It gets great reviews for its technical and ""story"" achievements but I wish all those magnificent skillz had been applied to something less ugly (artfully ugly, but still dog ugly).\nI kept feeling like a serial killer while shooting, clubbing, and burning very realistic looking men, women and children who left behind realistic looking twitching corpses. Call me soft, but I don't enjoy creeping through a duct to find a lonely woman listening to a melancholic radio song, and clubbing her to death with a wrench.\nThere is no way you can feel like the good guy in this scenario. Not even if you refrain from harvesting the little sisters.\nIf you like horror porn movies like ""Saw"", this is probably your cup of tea. If you flip channels when they air trailers for such movies, don't buy this game. It'll make you sick. I hope this counter balances all the wild enthusiasm and provides some needed caution.";Technically brilliant, depressingly creepy
22;6.0;1.0;46.0;"If you google on the article ""BioShock - Overrated Disneyland Ride"", I share many of the sentiments.  I just don't understand what game you reviewers were playing.  It sure wasn't BioShock.  I will try my best to not sound like yet another ""This sucks""  kind of person.  The graphics are amazing; the spotlight lighting and shading is pretty advanced.  Sometimes the enemy characters are so in the dark, they are hard to make out, but their features look pretty believable.  I also liked the Big Daddy character mulling around.  The story itself is also ok; a little different from the humans against the aliens shooters we are used to.  But, I am paying $60 to actually play a game not to foam at the mouth for eye-candy.\n\nFirst, the gameplay is just so amazingly basic;  You pick up guns, ammo, plasmids and you run around the dungeon like environment as characters pop up or the occasional turret or flying thingy.  This may not be so bad except for the fact that you don't really get to use your full range of motions.  You don't ever have to attack somebody above you or below you.  It is a basic forward shooting, dungeon FPS (almost kind of reminded me of Doom 1).  Oh yea, all of that is kind of pointless because if you aren't strapped for time, you can just respawn and finish off your characters without any real penalties.\n\nLet's look at Halo2 or Gears of War, for example.  In Halo 2, you might have to take out a bunch of weaker characters close up and then snipe the more difficult ones from a distance while using your soldiers as bait.  In Gears, it is the same thing; you are ducking behind walls corners so you don't get toasted by the Boomers, hoping your friendly characters might kill something.  In Bioshock, I just kind of ran around clubbing people with the wrench because I never really had any ammo.  I was bored to tears.\n\nNot a big deal, but what happened to Animation sequences or End chapter sequences.  All I am getting is that silly radio message popup or maybe a diary message which I won't normally listen to.  Those aren't very exciting and makes it hard to appreciate the story.\n\nMaybe I am wrong, It could be possible.  I am flexible in my analysis of the game if you want to comment on it.\n\nAnd I am only at 60% completion, so maybe that other 40% is where the amazing part of the game is.  I don't know.  To be honest, I don't think I can continue.";The most overrated game in the history of games
27;7.0;1.0;33.0;"Wow, so apparently this game is a ""perfect 10"" based upon some game aficionados. I had high hopes when I purchased this game 3 days ago...already I'm bored with it. As a fan of FPS, I thought a ""perfect 10"" game would have me coming back for more. Not with this game. The game play was short, 1 dimensional, and lacking a multiplayer that would rival Halo2. I'm sorry, but for a FPS game (not games like Oblivion, which in my opinion is a far superior game) to NOT have a multiplayer or have serious flaws with their multiplayer (ala Gears of War) is a HUGE factor is rating the game. Since Bioshock doesn't have multiplayer, I took it down 2 stars.\n\nThe most annoying aspect of this game is when you play it on hard level. It takes a thousand shots to kill a regular enemy. It takes a million shots to kill a Big Daddy. This normally wouldn't be a problem, if it was easy to accumulate ammo.  Unfortunately for a FPS game, you spend the entire time searching dead bodies and crates looking for ammo or money to buy ammo instead of actually enjoying the shooting aspect of everything. Some will chalk to this up to ""amazing game play features"" but its retarded. Its a FPS game, not a role playing game. What a waste of time.\n\nThe same can be said for the powers that you use. You basically get to use your ""adam"" powers twice before you've drained it, THEN you gotta scrounge around even more to find ""eve"" (which refills your adam powers) or money to buy eve. Another huge waste of time.\n\nBioShock would have been astute to have the Eve recharge on its own, so you can enjoy using your powers instead of rarely using them so you don't accidentally waste them.\n\nAlso, I played the game on hard and beat it quite easily. I found the Big Daddy's to be a lot harder than the final battle with Fontaine (the boss). He was so easy that it was laughable. What a lackluster ending.\n\nI wanted to enjoy this game, but for the aforementioned reasons, I was more frustrated than pleased. Be warned, this game is a RENTAL. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING IT!!! You will grow tired of it in a hurry.";Not a fan...very disappointing
5;8.0;3.0;21.0;"At the beginning of Bioshock, the player is whisked away to Rapture, a would-be Objectivist utopia on the ocean floor.  But, like so many utopias, things went horribly wrong, and Rapture is now rotting underwater, inhabited by the last of its former citizens, who have modified their genetic codes so much as to be barely human.  The player's task, at first, is simply to escape the city alive, using a combination of traditional weaponry (such as a machine gun, shotgun, and the ever-visceral wrench) and plasmids, gene-altering technology that bestows psychic powers.\n\nBioshock, like the city it supposes, is a searing flash of failed ambition.  Time and again conservative design and conventional narrative choices belie the game's evident desire to reach something more important.  Critics lauded the complex moral choices with which the game purportedly confronts the player, yet there is really only one such choice to be made (whether or not to kill the little girls who wander Rapture, thereby gaining more ""plasmid fuel"" for yourself), and it makes almost no difference in the overall gameplay.  The progression of the game's story, rather than being affected by player choices, is basically inevitable.  The game's conceit that there is moral conflict in its world would be strengthened if something more than just the brief ending cinema were affected by the player's actions.\n\nIt's clear that Bioshock wants to say something pointed, even powerful, about man's place in his own life and how much we may be in thrall to forces beyond our control, and this aspiration alone makes it somewhat unique among video games.  But in the end, its own conservativism betrays its vision.  Bioshock disappoints exactly because it could have been so much more.\n\n~";Under-realized
3;9.0;1.0;5.0;"this game is a perfect example of the degeneracy that is causing the world to rot within.when people open thier window and ask ""what is wrong with the world?"". ""how did we get to such a lowly state?"".i will answer ""things like bioshock"".\nin case you don't know,this is a game in which you can murder children.not one or two,hundreds,one by one.not only that,you are rewarded for doing it.you get better rewards for murdering small girls than if you let them go.every time you meet a opponent,which is many many,you are posed withe choice to murder the child or not.if you dont,you get a tiny reward.if you do,you get the reward times 3.so you are not only rewarded times 3 for murdering the children,you are encouraged to do so.\nand some sick #$%^^%$%^&*$#$% actualy said,quote""you are posed with a moral choice"".calling that a ""moral choice"" is sick and disgusting beyond words.and whoever these people are who are playing and enjoying this game should be quaranteened and either studied or put down.\nyou want to know why people are so evil?its because of garbage like bio shock.";what the heck is wrong with people?
42;10.0;5.0;17.0;Very simply put right now this game is easily the best shooter to come out for the 360 in a long time.\nNot only does it have some very tense and fun gameplay.\n\nThe lighting and graphical displays shown within are pretty much second to none as of this moment.\n\nI bought the game on midnight of the 20th/21st and immediately went home to play it. The experience of just how good the graphics are was 10 fold when I was playing with the lights off. I don't even have a HDTV and I was purely impressed by just how good everything looked.\n\nThe game also goes a long way to genuinely disturb and creep you out.\nIts not the typical BOO factor like games like the Resident Evil series and maybe even FEAR. Not that that is a bad thing.\nBut this game tends to be creepy on a psychological level only truly experienced by playing first hand.\nThe idea of this underwater utopian city gone completely wrong may not be the most original idea but it is definitely executed well.\n\nThe sounds are easily the number one thing that makes the game so creepy at times. If you do get to play it, find a spot to just stand still for a moment and take it all in. You hear everything from steam pipes creaking to soft whispers of one of 2k's delightfully twisted characters coming from somewhere up ahead. And the sounds you hear aren't always necessarily right around the corner. Which is whats so great, the voices you hear may be coming from the other side of a wall or a room down the pathway.\n\nThe AI is also really impressive. They do things like run and jump into water when set on fire, they take off running when they get low on health. They attack in numbers at times making for some very frantic and fast paced combat. The number of weapons and plasmid modifications is truly something to behold. The ability to aim your electric shock at water and fry your opponents may not seem like a big deal, but when you can do that instead of wasting numerous rounds of ammunition believe me you will appreciate it much more. The weapon combos are great. You can shock and stun opponents, set them on fire, freeze them, tag them so that security drones will attack them instead of you. All the while still being able to do something as simple as a shotgun blast to the face.\n\nI do wish cycling weapons was a bit quicker at times. Your right hand weapons are bound to the RB button and you have to cycle thru them in order to find the right one which can be annoying in times of a fast firefight. But you can easily overcome this.\n\nBottom line is, this one definitely has my vote for Game of the Year, or maybe Assassins Creed but that one is still yet to be seen.\n\nGo out and buy this one if you can, it is definitely worth the price of admission.;Simply the best.
45;11.0;5.0;16.0;"When rating a game like Bioshock that has been hyped up for over a year, one has to consider these 4 important questions.\n\n1) Does it live up to the hype?\n2) Is it fun to play?\n3) Does it distinguish itself from other FPS?\n4) Is it a true next gen game?\n\nThe answer to all four of these questions is a resounding YES!\n\nBioshock brings you to the underwater city of Rapture, a dystopian world that is falling apart rapidly. Based on paper thin ideals and materialistic beliefs, the civilization of Rapture has fallen into insanity and sheer madness.\nA chemical called ADAM has tainted and distorted the minds, and bodies, of the citizens, turning everyone literally c-r-a-z-y!\n\nPsychotic, mutated and twisted citizens lurk around every corner of this destroyed beauty called Rapture. And it IS beautiful. Bioshock boasts some really amazing and beautiful graphics, fulfilling part of question 4.\nThe architecture of Rapture is firmly planted in the 1960's and really adds bucket loads of flavor to the overall story and feel of the game. From posters to furniture, you really do get the sense that you are IN the 1960's.\nOn the graphical note, the water, and there is plenty of it, is probably the best looking, flowing and most realistic water to ever grace a video game. I was simply amazed at the water. I hear that the Bioshock developers had a whole team working on the water effects/graphics alone. Well, it has certainly paid off.\nBioshock also uses the Unreal 3 engine (think Gears of War), so the graphics are phenomenal and character movements are fluid and realistic.\nDetails are abound. Weapons are detailed down to the most minute detail (ribbed design on the shotgun pump, cracks in the walls/floors). The lighting/shadows are stunning, and the character models are some of the most detailed in the video game world.\n\nBioshock is a First Person Shooter. We all know that the video game shelves of our local stores are chalk full of First Person Shooters (FPS). Stores are literally teeming with them.\nOne of the biggest arguments against the Xbox 360 was the fact that there was a lack of variety in terms of games, with the majority being FPS.\nI can safely say that Bioshock, though it may be a FPS, is FAR from your typical, standard FPS fare.\n\nWhile you will run into your typical FPS weapons (Shotgun, Handguns, Machine guns, explosives, wrench for a melee weapon and a few more standard weapons), you will also have access to something called Plasmids.\nPlasmids give you powers (i.e Telekenesis, the ability to shoot flames and electricity out of your hands, and even the ability to shoot wasps from your veins!)\nThese powers really change the FPS dynamic in a very profound way. Will you shock your enemy, then beat the tar out of them while they are stunned?, or will you incinerate them? Or, better yet, will you unleash a horde of wasps at them and watch them freak out? Your Plasmid powers even interact with the environment. You can use the shock ability to jump start faulty door switches, and if you spot an enemy in a pool of water you can shoot them with the electricity and watch them convulse.\n\nIf you spot an enemy in a pool of oil (yeah you will run into rooms that have oil spills) you can unleash Incinerate and watch them burn and spread the fire around.\n\nAn enemy throwing explosives at you, or is your way blocked by debris? No problem, with Telekenesis you can grab those pesky explosives in mid air and fling them back at the thrower or at debris blocking your advancement.\n\nAlso, you will find tonics along the way that will enhance other abilities, such as melee strength, hacking and even a tonic that will emit a shock to any enemy that attacks you with a melee attack, a sort of high voltage retribution.\n\nOn a side note, there are different types of bullets for each gun ranging from electrified ammo, armor piercing ammo and anti-personnel ammo. And if that's not enough, later on in the game you will be able to create your own ammo!\n\nYes, I did mention hacking earlier. Rapture has its share of vending machines (where you can buy ammo, health kits and plasmid refills), ammo machines, health stations, security bots, gun turrents and security cameras.\nIf you get in close to one of these machines, you will be given the opportunity to hack the machine. In an ingenious design, if you decide to hack a machine you will engage in a small mini game.\nDoes anyone remember an ancient game called Pipe Dream? The hacking mini game requires you to connect the ""entrance"" to the ""exit"" via two different types of pipes. There is a time limit however because fluid flows from the ""entrance"" and you need to get the fluid to the ""exit"". If you fail, the machine will overload and you will take damage, however you can retry as long as you have health left.\n\nLater on you will find hacking tools that will give you the option to auto hack, though its not always successful. You can also opt to pay a rather large amount to buy a guaranteed auto hack - but that would be boring!\n\nThere is quite a bit of collecting involved in Bioshock as well. There are the plasmids, tonics, ammo and even money all scattered about the city of rapture.\nWith all of that in mind, it is easy to see that Bioshock does in fact distinguish itself from all other FPS on the market, fulfilling question 3.\n\nGameplay, well that is another story. 2k games boasts that no two romps through Bioshock will be the same. And I can see why they make this claim. You have options, I mean lots and lots of options on how you want to go about your killing. This basically fulfills the second part of question 4, Bioshock IS a true Next Generation title.\n\nWith every said so far, it is safe to say that Bioshock is VERY fun to play. First of all, the controls are rather easy and follow the standard FPS controls that Halo popularized.\nThere are three difficulties, allowing you to ease into the game, and easy to use menus and interfaces.\nThe story line is very immerse, original and interesting. I can say that I have NEVER played a game with the same story line.\nAlso, Raptures history is revealed via tape recordings and diaries that you collect along the way, adding even more flavor to an already over flowing flavor pot.\nBasically Bioshock is equal parts an action game, survival horror game and a stripped down Role Playing Game in the vein of Deus Ex. And its mixed really well. Nothing ever feels over done or boring.\n\nAlso, following in the vein of ""choose your own adventure"" type games, Bioshock presents you with situations in which you will have to choose, morally, which way to go. This adds even more to an already amazing game. And, unlike other games that offer this, your choices and actions WILL affect the game.\n\nOverall, Bioshock lives up to the hype and is a must own for all Xbox 360 owners. I will warn that there is a lot of blood, gore and violence, not to mention a wide array of mature themes involved.\nIf you are into these things, and of age, you MUST pick this game up. Do not pass up on this, even if you are sick of the First Person Shooter genre, I guarantee that Bioshock is a unique and engaging experience that you will not regret paying $60 plus for.\n\nPrice is one of the biggest factors that can scare away potential consumers, since next generation games cost so much, consumers want to be sure that the game they are spending their hard earned money on is actually worth it. I can honestly say that Bioshock is worth it.";Cream of the FPS crop
49;12.0;5.0;16.0;"This is by far the most interesting, fun, adventurous game since last years Zelda for the Wii. There is so much to do in this game, you can hack into safes, invent items, shock someone in the water, use a crowbar to knock someone out, anything you want to do, you can. I didn't hear about this game until last week when Microsoft released a demo of it last week. I played the demo and immediately got hooked. I went out early this morning ""21 Aug 07"" and purchased this game. I have played it for roughly five hours and it has been so much fun. It's not super confusing and it's like a choose your own adventure game. The classical eery music is an added plus. If you own an XBOX 360 and you are looking for the ""Next Big Game"", or you just want a Phenomenal gaming experience, purchase this game, I guarantee you will not be disapointed. The only negative for me is that this game really makes other games look really bad. But that's a negative that I will just have to deal with. Now I am going to shut off the laptop and get back to playing.";Best Gaming Experience in a long time!
13;13.0;3.0;15.0;"The only thing shocking about Bioshock is the undue praise it gets.\nWhat is essentially an FPS with a passable array of weaponry and mildly useful superpowers is coated with very dark and moody, yet colorful graphics... then seasoned with a light dusting of bargain brand macabre story... and voila! You have Bioshock.\nThere was a lot left for wanting in this game.\n\nThe control was a little loose and switching from powers to weaponry could have been smoother. It feels very much like a PC game meant to be played with more precise and flexible controls. Enemies dart around very quickly, and unless you're the Flash on the analog sticks, you're going to endure a little frustration. A sharp FPS experience is easily marred when burdened by console controllers if no corrective measures are taken to tone it down half a notch. At the least more customizable analog options could have been included, such as acceleration, which makes a huge difference. When it comes to FPS, poor control options like that are a bad decision.\n\nThe graphics and physics were nice, although I'm a little tired of games intentionally being excessively dark in order to convey that angsty, brooding atmosphere. There was a lot of neon, which I suppose contrasts with the inky blackness to provide light and shadow and impress all the eye-candy addicts. For me, the style was a swing and a miss. I've seen better atmosphere and artistry in a plethora of other FPS games. That old 50s style imagery that reminded me very much of Fallout, but is not intended to be campy in the least. It is intended to reflect the era in which Rapture evolved, but again a swing and a miss for me.\n\nPlasmid powers are a nice gimmick, but aren't as useful to gameplay as I thought they would be. There are 9 powers (some with different levels), but since many are weaker or not as useful as others, you end up using 2 or 3 the majority of the game. Most are simply attack abilities anyways, which are easily replaced with a big gun. Combine this all with sometimes outrageous EVE (plasmid fuel) power usage. Psi Ops did the ""plasmid"" thing a long time ago and did it better.\nYou can always turn to your weapons.\n\nWeapons. 6. Only 6. For an FPS these days, that is pathetic. You can upgrade them, but they are for the most part the same weapon. Sad. I might as well go back to those plasmid powers... at least they are prettier.\n\nHacking. OK, so Bioshock is very obviously trying to be the next System Shock. Unfortunately hacking in Bioshock is simply a game of Pipe Dreams. If you don't like that, you can buy insta-hack items, which use up some useless cash and make hacking kind of a moot point. Another swing and a miss...\n\nInventions. A nice little time waster. Having to find machines scattered around where you can do it is annoying. This is no Dark Cloud or any other game where inventing/combining items is exciting and fruitful.\nTonics were a great part of the game and allowed the most customizability to your gameplay experience. This was singlehandedly the best thing Bioshock had to offer.\nResearch added a bit of spice to gameplay as well. Studying your enemies and getting to know more about them in order to more effectively deal with them was great. Unfortunately most of the time this resulted in just a damage bonus, but in the case of teleporting enemies, where you were suddenly able to see where they were moving, this mechanic added to the experience in a more satisfying way. I would have liked to have seen better enemy variety though. Most were just the same enemy type with a different weapon.\n\nNow mash all of this together and cover it with a story of evil and mayhem and ... blah blah. I didn't buy into it. At all. Since the main character offers nothing in terms of reactions, I felt no connection to him, the story or the game. It all just felt lifeless. It is also mainly delivered through radio chatter, which is so impersonal and boring.\n\nYou can replay it to see the ending you missed (there are only 2), but aside from a few yes/no type choices, the gameplay will be the exact same. To me, that's not replayability... that's reiteration, which is not the samee.";Proof that solid graphics and moodiness can sell an average-at-best shooter.
16;14.0;1.0;14.0;"This is written by a part time gamer who simply likes to enjoy a game. I find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting. All games should have a ""Very Easy"" option. I suspect that there are many others like me who would buy more games if they were not so difficult.\n\nI thought the rest of the game was great. Because this was frustrating rather than fun I give it a 1 star. I wish I would not have bought it to pay for being frustrated.";Too difficult for part time gamers
19;15.0;3.0;14.0;"Before playing Bioshock, I kept reading reviews that said it looked soooo much better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-3/dp/B000FRU0NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 3</a>, even though Halo had yet to ship. I have to say, I think they're wrong. Bioshock is quite detailed and enjoyable to look at, but has grossly shinny surfaces (dull surfaces being something Halo excels at). Additionally the ""sky boxes"" for the underwater city pale in comparison to the miles of ""real geometry"" used in Halo 3. I found the levels to be very detailed and convincing, till I walked up to a window and saw a badly distorted and over-scaled matte used to portray the skyline...\n\nGameplay is entertaining, but ""moral choices"" for which the game has been lauded, are little more than tacked on. Other than the different outcomes of the game, there's really very little that these choices will impact. You may receive slightly more Adam one way or the other, but the real choices are how you spend it not how you get it.\n\nStoryline is excellent with twists and turns, though like a Shyamalan movie, are only really good the first time around and are kinda obvious to astute folks. Some plot points seem to appear fairly quickly though the game continues to hit you over the head with them just in case you didn't see them coming.\n\nMy one complaint is that the game is simply dark and depressing for the sake of being that way. It is in the ""sci-fi horror"" genre of course, but the same story could have been told in a compelling way without the horror clichs. It may well have been scarier without all the clichs.

I see 10 out of 10 in what i think was Game Informer (not sure) and I know now never trust the magazines. Always go by the the number one basic rule of gaming try it before you buy it.

36;17.0;3.0;10.0;"Let me start off by saying that this is an excellent game.  The gameplay excells.  The graphics are near-perfect.  Combat is interesting and dynamic.  The story demonstrates the dangers of moral relativism.  It's a well thought out, well executed game.  Rapture's landscape is simply amazing.\n\nThat being said, it is very much deserving of the M rating.  Blood is shiny and realistic.  Mutilated corpses line the streets.  The language is strong with many random uses of the f-word.  This is unfortunate as it is unnecessary.  The idea of a hidden utopia under the sea filled with crazy people is very unsettling in and of itself.  The gore and language does nothing but take the focus away from the naturally unsettling landscape and suspensful story line.  It is a non-stop gorefest in the same vein as ""Saw.""\n\nI cannot wait until the day when videogame developers learn that this stuff isn't necessary to make a great game.  Without the extreme violence and language, this is a phenominal game in every sense of the word.";Great game, but parents be warned...

This is not your balls to the wall shoot em up, but rather a thinking person's game where the point is to interact and enjoy the story, creatively think your way past enemies and make decisions that will affect your game play.\n\nAll of you have probably heard about the creative elements of the game play...others who reviewed it have covered it, so I really don't want to get into that...if you have read enough about it I would say you have to see for yourself.\n\nWhat is more important to me is how much this game creeps up on you and scares you into playing a little bit more. This game IMO revolutionizes the FPS because of the content. It's pretty much doing things storywise what Resident Evil and Doom has been trying to do for years.\n\nI am recommending that if you play this game, don't do it on anything less than a home theater system.\n\nI am playing this on a 51"" HDTV, 7.1 surround sound with the lights on dim and my goodness it is IMMERSIVE. YOU WILL JUMP...you will laugh...you will be scared....the first time I faced off with a big daddy it was to be believed. It crept up behind me...I heard it coming and instead of turning with my joystick I literally truned around and luckily I didn't already aggro it but it was up on me and walked byand my heart was in my throat.  There is this one scene early on (and u get to see it in the demo) where you see a sillouette of a lady rambling to a baby in a carriage and it's truly eeirie and there are SO many moments like this throughout the game. You can gather recordings to listen to the insanity that these people were into. And sometimes feel sorry for some of the people that you have to kill.\n\nAnd yes, there are even more mysteries in this game. again similar to Lost...and this is where I wrap up:\n\n- Is it a coincidence that your plane crashed here?\n\n- What is the story behind the tattoes?\n\n- What went wrong and made these people crazy?\n\n- Who or what are the Little Sisters and why must you choose?\n\n- Why would any seemingly sane person that wound up on this island willingly inject himself with gene altering material to get powers and what effects will they have on your character by the end of the game?\n\nIf you are looking for a game that will keep you in the dark while you play it in the dark (best way to play) BUY...THIS...GAME.

9;19.0;1.0;9.0;"Don't believe the hype.  Look at all the reviews on this site that just blush about this game.  They all seem a bit too well written, i.e. how amazon is known for selling reviews and promoting such great reviews for products with a lot of marketing behind them.\n\n  Back to the actual game.  My first complaint.  There is just too much going on, the game's environment is way too busy.  Most games of this nature would introduce complicated aspects to a game a piece at a time.  This game unloads more than a handful of new aspect:, game play, plot structure, up mods (of which there are plasmoids and other such features, of which's ammo aren't named the same but are ADAM and EVE) game mapping all in a matter of a minimum of two hours of game play.  The map is just utterly confusing, even with the arrow that points you in the right directon (which it does only at cerain aspects of the game).  To help on this confusion they have a number of ""diaries"" made to unlock glimpses of the plot to you.  Playing for about a half hour two hours in I ran across at least five.  It becomes so over whelming to have to listen to these diaries to keep up to date on what you're supposed to look out for that they should have found a better way to incorporate them into the game (i.e. You have to find them, recognize them asgainst the several options you have to search for - ammo, money, plasmoids, upgrades, health, etc etc - that to see ""oh it's another diary on the microscopic font on the screen"" and then hold down A and listen to it while doing everything else.)\n\n  Additionally, the setting is so dark - which as a mood setter is good, but for game play is horrible.  Someone would appear behind you shooting a tommy gun and it would take more than a few seconds of gaping around before they're actually found.  At which point you've lost a good amount of health.  Then there's the vita tanks.  The points where if you die you're automatically respawned with just about every weapon/item you had before.  And if you were fighting an someone, then the damage you had inflicted is still present.  Ever heard of that in a game before?  Neither had I, and it's there because if it wasn't you toss the game in your closet and forget it.\n\n  Did you play Condemned:  Criminal Origins?  Did you like it?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  In that case avoid this game, because the fighting style is basically the same.  Nameless lackee jumps out from wall swinging wildly in that same clunky manner, running in the same style.  And you're melee attack is exactly the same.  They may have well as called this game.  Condemned:  Aquatic Surrender.  Thank God, I rented it.";Don't Believe the Hype
15;20.0;2.0;9.0;This game was so much fun.  The visuals were stunning.  The music and genre felt like an epic 1920's storyline.  These new plasmid type weapons that eradicate enemies from your left arm are too cool !!!!!!!  Then the game is over.  Just as fast as it started and swallowed me into this underwater world, it was over.  Well I beat it in 2 days.  There is no reason I had to waste $50-60 just to beat it in 2 days.  I read an article were the game creator is talking about releasing new plasmids for xbox live download. Would I actually play this game all the way through again just cause I have some new plasmids? NO WAY!  I will never put this game in the xbox again.  Once I beat a game its done.  It is never the same again.  It loses its grandeur.  It also has no multiplayer so the replay value is absolutely ZERO.\n\nSummary:  This is probably the coolest game you will play this year.  Save your money and rent it.;RENT this awesome game.
25;21.0;4.0;9.0;"I can tell you right now, this game will not live up to the hype.  It cannot possibly live to the hype.  The hype suggests that the game should arrive with sexual favors and pudding as a feature, and no game is as good as the reviewers would have you believe Bioshock is.  Surprise, surprise - the game has a number of issues that keep it from being the transcendental achievement the press want it to be, but that doesn't stop it from being a very solid game, worth your $60 investment.\n\nLet's start with the basics.  This is ostensibly a first person shooter, in the family of Halo, but owing a little bit more to Oblivion and Deus Ex so far as implementation goes.  Or F.E.A.R., I guess, though that one had multiplayer.  Which, shock of shocks, is one of the major knocks on the game.  This game was never designed or balanced for multiplayer use, and, as such, there's no multiplayer.  No deathmatch, no leaderboards, no team sports, no cooperative.  To preserve the atmosphere of the game and to produce a better single-player title, the multiplayer was never intended to happen.  If you cannot tolerate a game without multiplayer (I personally don't see how anybody could tolerate one, as I agree with Yahtzee!'s assessment of the Xbox Live community in general), then this game is not for you.\n\nAs far as the actual gameplay goes, a great amount of puffery and chest-beating has been made with respect to the RPG aspect, but I honestly don't see it here.  There isn't really any kind of character development or progression - the plasmids are merely guns that work with your left hand and don't have a trigger, and the tonics function basically like equip-able items in other games - and, overall, you don't get the RPG ""feel"" from this game.  The feel is, more than anything, reminiscent of Doom 3 (to which it has been compared), with a dark, moody setting and some very cleverly disguised monster closeting (i.e. instead of just popping out of the wall, some monsters will walk into a room behind you after you go looking for something and start playing around in the water).\n\nI'll admit it - after about half of the game, I was pretty bored.  You run through the stock of enemies (who don't behave in nearly as intelligent a fashion as implied) pretty early on and most of the game is spent shooting the same types of critters with the same set of voices and the same general behaviors.  While the environment is constantly interesting to poke around in, the adversaries are lamentably not.  Hacking also plays a major role in the game, which would be great if the mini-game didn't 1) arbitrarily decide that you just plain lose sometimes; and 2) take thirty seconds to play through on its easiest difficulty.  While you can work your way up to not having to hack a couple of common targets, you'll be playing Pipe Dream right up through the end of the game.  Pretty tedious.\n\nSo what's so good about the game?  Well, for starters, it's a shooter I finished, which is saying something, because I become terminally bored with just about any of them after about the halfway point, for mostly the same reasons as those I've listed here.  This one kept my attention all the way through to the end.  The game isn't overly long (a problem many games have - sixty hours is not just right; it is far too much for an old man like me with a job and a house and a personal life), which is a plus for me.  The voice acting is the best I've personally ever heard in a video game - so good that you don't notice that it's voice acting in most cases.  The artistic direction is pretty good as well, capturing some of the sixties architecture.\n\nWith respect to the source material and authenticity, there's some quibbles to be had.  The guns and ammunition you find are distinctly more 1920s than 1950s, the music is mostly big band and crooners, and while the game might be considered reminiscent of Objectivism, the philosophy is way, way too far off to be considered any kind of a critique, or even a reasonable examination.  The Atlas Shrugged vibe is, however, carried off with aplomb, for which the art director in particular deserves some praise.\n\nThis is a pretty great game.  I played it, finished it, and am wondering whether it would be worth it (news flash - it won't) to go back through on Hard to get the final achievement I'm lacking.  It's worth anybody's $60.  I wouldn't pronounce it the game of the year at this point, with Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed and Rock Band and Halo 3 and any number of other AAA titles due out, but it's a good game, and a good use of the medium to turn a shooter into something other than a twitchy-flinchy-shooty-bangy-kill-a-thon and still be effective and straight-faced about it.  Any game that can stir a moral reaction in its audience through its content and story is pretty solid (and you will have a moral reaction to the Little Sisters and what goes on in Rapture).  I wouldn't call it art, but it's some great entertainment.";Reasonably Good
14;22.0;3.0;8.0;"The game Bioshock has been rated highly by the player community and the game press, but I find that the game has serious shortcomings that really reduce the enjoyment of the game.\nIt's hard to rank the flaws from serious to less serious, but they add up.\nThe game is primarily a first person shooter.  As such the weapons, challenges and non-player character behavior is important to player enjoyment.  In Bioshock, the weaponry starts underpowered, and fails to progress at a rate that keeps up with challenge difficulty, even though the game designers provide sparse and highly scripted ""weapons upgrades"".  The NPC algorithms are primitive, for instance the routing algorithms are highly flawed (NPCs go to odd or impossible places and often get stuck) and the designers use ultra high speed translation by NPCs such as the splicers or ""Rosies"" exhibit to enhance difficulty.  This speed motion often seems unfair and frustrating.  At other points in the game, the designers provided ""barrier"" puzzles that simply consist of lots of NPCs gangin up on the player.  It's easy to eventually defeat these puzzles, but not rewarding at all.  Contrast Bioshock to Half-life2 where the player is constantly involved in trying to figure out what happened or what the authorities or covenant are up to in order to progress.  Bioshock is nowhere near the Half-Life caliber of game play.\nThen there is the art work.  Bless the artists for putting so much style into this game, but the game seems to be designed for the sake of the art, and I have to say, it is not that impressive.  The style is 50s modern or in many cases 50s noveau-deco and although initially entrancing, is highly repetitive and becomes tiresome after several hours of game play.  For instance there are only four or five variations of NPC splicers - they all look the same.\nBioshock is set undersea, and the rendering of water and aquatic scenes is supposed to be the big artistic achievement, but frankly the water rendering (as on XBox-360) is not all that impressive.  Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls III had much better fluid physics, tranparency, fog and refraction in its rendering of water than Bioshock and it was rendered on a much older engine and technology, XBox circa 2002.\nThe event that finally put me over the edge (I refrained from throwing my controller through my LCD, but just barely) was the entirely frustrating finall boss battle.  I won't reveal the end, but who's idiotic idea was it anyway to refuse players the right to save their game during this battle?  Are we trying to prove the level designer is more manly than the players or something.\nIn short I recommend that prospective players or gift buyers simply skip Bioshock and go to Half-Life2 orange box, a true masterwork in the FPS/Adventure genre.";Bioshock - Dissenting Opinion
33;23.0;5.0;8.0;I have been a hardcore gamer for at least 10 years and have played many a game, especially shooters. The genre has grown pretty stale, with the same concepts rehashed over and over, albeit with prettier graphics. The last really creative shooter was Deus Ex, which blended the FPS and RPG worlds.  Bioshock is it's spiritual successor, really merging the two genres in a wholly unique setting.  One pro review I read said calling it a game is an understatement - I agree.  It is so much more because of the story, the stunning voice acting, and the underwater setting circa 1946.  So much incredible detail has gone into every main area - graphics, acting, story, gameplay - I have been pretty much blown away, and I was close to just finding a new hobby. I highly recommend this game.;A BADLY NEEDED BREATH OF FRESH AIR!
1;24.0;5.0;8.0;"If you haven't heard about this game, check out the videos on XBox Live or the demo: or the videos on other game review sites... It's a fun, cool game.\n\nART STYLE\nGame is set in 1960, and the art style is a snazzy, art-deco style reminescent of Fallout (at least the fake ""ads"" in the game).  The setting of the city on the bottom of the ocean is a visual treat along with the omni-present water that is leaking into most structures.\n\nACTION\nThe game mostly focuses on action and fun.  The save system doesn't punish players for character death and encourages players to try out various strategies.  The combination of plasmids (""magical"" powers) and regular weapons makes for some entertaining ways of defeating enemies.  If you like shooters, you'll take great pleasure setting up ambushes and responding to ambushes.  This definitely is a first-person shooter, though the plasmids make this have somewhat of a feel of a role-playing game.\n\nTHEMES\nThe general theme is the fall of a utopia society.  Rapture, the city, is literally falling apart and buckling under the weight of the ocean.  You also have some moral choices to make during the course of the game.\n\nOverall, the combination of everything is just right and its a extra fun (scary) to play at night.";Beautiful, scary, & fun!
7;25.0;5.0;7.0;"How's this for a story? A man becomes annoyed with the current world, a world where the great are taken for granted and told that their toils are either for the people, for God or for the government. In response, he creates a fantastic environment, free from all of these turmoils. A place where all the great men and women of the world can create their own inventions without fear of consequence. In this place, men and women could do what they wanted.\n\nIf this sounds like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, you'd be correct. However, in this particular case, it's also the background story behind Rapture, the under-water city that takes centerplace in Bioshock. Many words have been bandied about about video games and their ability (or inability) to become art; you have folks like Roger Ebert saying the medium as a whole can never attain that goal. My personal thought that was that, as a medium, games haven't made enough strides toward that lofty goal. But Bioshock certainly takes a huge step forward.\n\nAndrew Ryan is a visionary the likes of which his namesake Ayn Rand would possibly write about in Atlas Shrugged. He exemplifies the qualities of a Randian hero and showcases Rand's philosophy of objectivism. He created the city of Rapture and filled it, much like John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, with the visionaries of his land. Rapture soon was a thriving city that emphasized science and growth and the importance of the individual. They dabbled in creating plasmids that changed a person's DNA, enabling them to do feats the likes of which had never been seen before.\n\nThen something happened.\n\nFlying over the Atlantic sea, you are Jack, a person who was destined for greatness, if you ask his parents, and whose plane is now crashing into the sea. Jack is apparently the only survivor of the plane wreck and swims to a lone building, a light house it seems, that beckons him onward. Eventually, he goes into a blathysphere and enters into the world of Rapture. But this isn't the Rapture originally envisioned in the pre-recorded film he watches as he journeys into the city. It is a city comprised of deadly machines, once-human monstrosities named Splicers who are insane and, of course, the Big Daddies and Little Sisters.\n\nBioshock concerns itself with the gray area between right and wrong. This dichotomy between right and right is what fuels everything in Rapture. Roaming the landscape, the Little Sisters are twisted abominations of little girls who locate corpses (which they call ""Angels"") and harvest Adam from them with a long needle. More grotesque is that bottle at the other end of the needle that the Little Sisters drink from. Dutifully following them are the Big Daddies, giant brutes in ancient diving gear. These...things...are at the heart of the story and Jack's survival depends on them and whether he can harvest the Little Sisters or set them free.\n\nThe conscience of the gamer is represented in two mysterious figures, Atlas (another allusion to Rand) and Dr. Tenenbaum. Atlas seemingly wants Jack to save his family and explains that the Little Sisters are anything but the human girls they appear. He nudges Jack to put them out of their misery and take the Adam they harvest so he can survive and save Atlas and his family. On the other shoulder perches Tenenbaum, another mysterious individual who created the Little Sisters and seems to want to do anything possible to save them. They are the obvious angel and devil sitting on Jack's shoulder, but the question is...which one is the angel?\n\nTo go into further detail would be to spoil this amazing story. Along the route, twists and turns abound with moral, ethical and philosophical questions aplenty. What's interesting is the way Bioshock presents a stark opposition to Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Rand's heroes always contain the same qualities that Andrew Ryan exemplifies. But here, the artists behind Bioshock seem to be questioning these qualities by presenting a situation so familiar to Atlas Shrugged, and yet, so far removed.\n\nIt is literate, thoughtful, disturbing and moving. Even if the gameplay didn't live up to the story, Bioshock would be worthy just for this reason.\n\nLuckily, that's not the case. For the gun hungry, sure, Rapture is filled with guns aplenty and even presents opportunities for you to craft your own upgrades. But that is just scratching the surface. Everything goes back to the story. Plasmids are located across the ruined debris of Rapture and contain the keys to recreating your DNA. Some early examples of Plasmids are the ability to shoot electricity from your hands to being able to set things on fire to telekinesis.\n\nBut these plasmids aren't only used for fighting. Minor puzzle-solving crops up, some of which require plasmids in the same way as gear in Legend of Zelda. The biggest puzzle is how to take down the game's variety of enemies. While you can definitely charge in, guns blazing and sometimes survive, cases will present themselves where such tactics will end with you on the bad end of the Big Daddies' drill. Instead, you can create your own traps and war zones. Using plasmids, the environment and, of course, your weapons, you can create elaborate traps that will bring a smile to your face.\n\nA lot of games coming out right now that use the Unreal 3 engine don't look as spectacular as they could. In particular, character models tend to look shiny and/or completely ugly. This is not the case with Bioshock. Everything comes together, from the disturbing scenery, the art deco architecture to the the insane creatures and characters populating the world.\n\nShadows and lighting also create a sense of atmosphere that drips heavily, much like the water pouring down the walls. It's stunning. The only complaint (and it is minor) is that the frozen portions you can melt don't look very convincing. When things melt, they don't leave anything behind. The only reason it sticks out is that the rest of the game is absolutely beautiful and amazingly crafted.\n\nNone of this would be as effective, though, without superior sound. And Bioshock has that (mostly) in spades. The voice work is stunning throughout and the actors provide a great sense of dread. The audio diaries do an exemplary job of providing the backstory, but also work the best in crafting dread and terror. Some of the most disturbing things occur listening to them. Unfortunately, sometimes the characters' lines are repeated too often, ruining the disturbing nature of their dialogue.\n\nMusically, the game is also amazing. It flits into the picture at key moments, increasing the tension before it will flow away. You might not even notice it's there, but that's why it's so good.\n\nYou know, the funny thing about hype is how people react to it. Game journalists can go blue in the face trying to get people interested in forgotten gems such as Psychonauts, Beyond Good & Evil and Stranger's Wrath, and since they weren't financially successful they become these gems. When a game sells incredibly well and is hyped to the max (both of which fit Bioshock), people say ""over-rated.""\n\nIgnore the hype machine. I know you're tired of hearing about it. But give Bioshock a try, if you haven't yet. Download the demo for your PC or try it on Xbox Live. It is a game that's definitely worth everything that's been said about it and more.\n\nIt is art. And no words by ignorant movie critics will change that.";Would you kindly play this game?
11;26.0;1.0;7.0;"I'm a big fan of shooters, I bought the original Doom over 15 years ago and was hooked. I even gave up my beloved Mac for a PC, and have spent thousands on every new shooter that came out. I played System Shock 2 years ago, loved the story line, the gameplay, hacking computers and upgrading my ""specs"", tricking out my gear, searching containers, etc. So when I heard the sequel was due out in 2007, Bioshock, I couldn't wait to play it. $50.00 +, but, OK..most of the new game software out there runs about that, and if the game's good, you can spend years playing it. So, I load it up, and....nothing. Loads fine, opening sequence..fine. Then nothing but a black screen. Three tries, then nothing. Go to the Bioshock Website, all reviews are terrific (of course). Let's check the open Web. The mother lode. Hundreds of complaints, slow frame rates, stuttering audio, game crashes, load number restrictions, on and on. Now I'm sweating (once you break that seal, baby, you own it). So, I have another PC, also only about 3 years old, loaded it up and it did play just long enough to get me interested in the story line, all completely in slow motion, but you're so hungry for gameplay you'll shoot anything, even if it's like throwing a watermelon across a room. I got all the way to the 4th level, and it just wound down and stopped. Guess it just ran out of Steam. Speaking of Steam, sound familiar? What a waste of money. If you don't have dual processors, a gaming rig that's less than a year old (I had NVidia video card on one and ATI Radeon 9600 on the other), and endless patience for throwing your money down the toilet, stay away from this game.";SO not worth the wait.
17;27.0;5.0;7.0;"It's rare these days for games to really blow me away. I've been playing games for years and in the last few years it seems that no matter which game I play, it seems as though I've been there - done that. In rare occasions games will break new ground, but more often then not it seems as though games use rehashed formulas that have been tried and true, albeit boring at times.\n\nReally, when it comes down to it Bioshock doesn't really break new ground per-se, it just does everything right. It features a rich story line, great play mechanics, amazing voice acting and mind-blowing graphics. Lets talk about each of these subjects.\n\nThe Story Line\nI never like to give away too much in my reviews, so I'll just say what you probably already read about if you read anything about this game. The game starts out with you stranded in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. You don't know much of what happened, except that you were involved in a plane crash. You spot a lighthouse in the distance, next thing you know you're being sucked into the city of Rapture. At first sight it seems like Rapture is a great place to be. You hear stories of how the city doesn't let religion interfere with science and that the city of Rapture offers true freedom. You quickly realize Rapture isn't as perfect as it seems at first (go figure). You quickly learn of a man named Andrew Ryan, the main bad guy involved in the rise and fall of Rapture. Immediately you feel as though you must find out what exactly is going on here. The story sucks you in and doesn't let go, one of the reasons this game is so great. You will come across many diaries in the game that you must listen to, so you can fully understand the somewhat complex story line. Don't worry, each diary is spoken and can be listened to while you play.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nBioshock is an FPS, with a few RPG-ish elements. The game is based in the 1960s, so you wield weapons of that period. What's really cool is that you come across what's called Plasmids that alter your DNA and allow you to perform incredible feats such as throw fire, throw electricity, and throw just about any other object through telekinesis. There are quite a few plasmids available, the only trick is deciding which ones you want to keep. You only have a few slots for plasmids, so you must choose carefully. More slots will become available as you play.\n\nTo obtain plasmids you must gather a substance called Adam. The way you obtain Adam is through little girls called little sisters, which harvest Adam from dead bodies. You have to defeat ""Big Daddies"" in order to get to the little sisters and harvest the Adam. Once you beat the big daddy you have a choice. You can free the little sister of her parasite and gain a little bit of Adam, or you can sacrifice her to gain the maximum amount of Adam. This decision can be tough. You are promised that if you free them you will be rewarded, however if you free them you only get 1/2 the Adam. Also, your decision will alter the storyline a bit. Also, you can purchase tonics with Adam. Tonics are passive in that they don't really give you any new attacks, instead they offer abilities such as walking faster, or taking less damage from attacks.\n\nOne other cool feature is that you can hack machines such as cameras and vending machines. In order to hack a machine you have to beat a little fun mini-game, which will vary in difficulty depending on the machine you're hacking. Typically if you hack machines such as vending machines you will be offered more goods and lower prices. If you hack cameras and guns then they will turn on your enemies. There are many more gameplay elements, but I don't want to make this review much longer then it already is. Trust me, there is plenty here to have fun with.\n\nGraphics and Sound\nThe sound effects and voice acting in this game is way above average. Every line is spoken so convincingly that it really does help draw you into the game. The music in this game fits the theme perfectly.\n\nThe graphics in this game are nothing short of amazing. In fact, these are some of the best graphics I've ever seen in my life - on any platform. The dynamic lighting is amazing, the fog effects are incredible, the water effects are some of the best I've ever seen. This is the first time I've been truly blown away by graphics on the XBox 360. I can't believe how amazing this game looks. Everyone was all excited about the graphics on Gears of War. I never really understood why. The visuals on GOW are good, but the color palate grew boring - everything seemed to be some sort of gray hue. Bioshock however has a very large color palate, from very dark and Doom-esque to very bright and vivid. The textures are very realistic. If Bioshock was a 10 for graphics, then Gears of War would be a 4 just because Bioshock is much more beautiful and very dynamic. The first time you see a spotlight shining along the wall you will know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a graphics snob, but when graphics are this good it really does help draw you in. You always hear people say ""Graphics don't make the game"". Although there is truth to that, visuals like this really do make the game more immersive. It's like the difference between standard and HDTV... it's just better.\n\nTo conclude I would like to say that this is a must own single player game. This game does just about everything right. Although each element in this game in itself isn't really ground-breaking, the way everything is tied together so perfectly is. I didn't explore everything in this review, that job is up to you. Go buy this game and find out what makes Bioshock such an epic experience.";The first XBox 360 game that truly blew me away.
18;28.0;5.0;7.0;"I bought this for my husband as a gift . I was a little nervous about buying without his input but based on the majority of reviews it sounded worth the chance. I don't play video games and my husband is a weekend player at most, that is until BioShock. He LOVES this game. He plays nightly and sometimes for hours (as opposed to his previous half hour or so). I find myself watching him play and I enjoy it as well. The details and grahics are amazing on every level. Based on my husbands' response to this game, I would have to say ""go for it"". I've read a lot of buzz about it being game of the year. It would surely have our vote.";I am a BioShock widow!
23;29.0;1.0;7.0;"This game is awful. Sure, the graphics are amazing,\nbut they are also great in gears and halo. This game\ngot such a hype, AND FOR WHAT???????

26;30.0;2.0;7.0;"I grew up in the age of Atari, Nintendo, SNES, Sega etc. and i use to dream of games looking realistic and being immersed in it. Bioshock sadly does neither, the pace of the game can get annoyingly quick to were you really have no time to just explore Rapture, unlike say Oblivion where you can pretty much explore all day and not have anything jump out at you. Also the graphics are very good, but seem very doom 3ish. I have been playing FPS games since wolfenstein and DOOM came out, and i must admit they are getting old. I think next gen consoles need to quit worrying so much about creating ""just"" great enviroments and start creating some great GAMES. Most stuff on Xbox 360 you find is shoot this, blow up that, kill this, mame that, it just gets repetitious after the first 20 minutes of nearly every game you play. We need more platformers, remember games like\nSonic, Tomb Raider, Maximo(PS2), Sly COOPER(ps2), the list goes on, even Gears of War, Lost Planet, and Resident Evil 4 while violent still had more depth than all the First Person Shooters combined. To make a long story short i'm tired of walking around just seeing my hand or arm sticking out shooting things point blank.\nGames to look forward to\nCrash Of The Titans(definately Different)\n\nA new Next gen MX ATV game wow FINALLY!!! after 2 years.\n\nAssassins Creed-This will own even Halo 3, sorry fanboys:)\n\nAlone in the Dark-Yeah now we're talking the first next gen Survival Horror Game!!\n\nResident evil 5 whenever it makes it way out.\n\nIndiana Jones-Pysched as hell for this one.\n\nClive Barkers Jericho-Yes maybe and FPS, technically survival horror though:D\n\nSo lets get the variety back in gaming, heck i still play the PS2 more than the 360 just because of all the different games:)\n\nAnd btw keep Halo 3 it does not look impressive, never understood the hype  of that game seek and destroy your enemy, gee that hasn't been done before has it???";I'm FPSed out!!! Lets get something new.
28;31.0;5.0;7.0;What hasn't already been said about Bioshock?  I'm probably only 1/3 to 1/2 complete with the game, and I've been drawn into it like very few games have ever drawn me in.  Easily one of the most atmospheric, immersive, and genuinely eerie entertaining experiences, you play the role of a plane crash survivor who, by chance (or fate?), stumbles into an underwater metropolis built by a crazed megalomaniac, Andrew Ryan.  The city is in shambles and is in overrun by splicers, humans who've altered their genetic code so that they are almost beyond recognition and have lost much of their sanity.  The oppression and desolation is thick and palpable, as you first set foot in Rapture.  The rest is for you to discover..\n\nBioshock is the most complete package in a single-player gaming experience.  A compelling and subtly-told story that doesn't rely on cutscenes or cheap gimmicks will ignite your curiosity.  A set of ancient looking weapons, combined with the power of plasmids, genetic modifications that give their wielder super-human powers, will intrigue you.  You will need to make hard decisions at every turn on how to proceed, what genetic powerups to employ, and what weapons to keep at your side.  I found myself wrestling with decisions on how to proceed or how to deal with different situations in the game.\n\nOn the technical side, Bioshock looks absolutely beautiful.  It's a great application of the Unreal Engine (which is what Gears of War was built on), and even trumps Gears' visuals from time to time.  The sound design is brilliantly executed.  Make sure you have a proper surround setup, as the game will envelop you with a creepy, crawls-under-your-skin aural experience.  Placement of effects is well done in a convincing 360 degree soundfield, and you will readily use this to your advantage in hearing from where enemies are approaching.  The game runs smooth and has very minimal load times that only occur between major areas.  You'll likely play in an area for an hour or two before ever encountering a load time.\n\nBioshock is as complete as a gaming experience can be.  It will make you think, thrill you, frighten you, engage you, and haunt you.\n\nIf you have a 360, you have no excuse.. Get this game now.;A rare and truly great gaming experience.
38;32.0;5.0;7.0;I don't play A LOT of video games, but I got a 360 a few months ago (I previously owned a PS2, PS1, and N64) and got BioShock the day it came out. It is without a doubt the best game I have EVER played. Gears of War and Max Payne are up there, but BioShock is so creative and awesome. If you own a 360, this is a must. Even if you don't, you can always buy one. It's a fun game while it's challenging, but not too hard to the point where it's extremely frusterating.\n\nThis is truly a one-and-only game.;Best game I have ever played
41;33.0;4.0;7.0;There are a ton of reviews here detailing the great aspects of this game, and I agree with them all.  So, in the interest of time, I'm just going to touch on why I gave a 4 out of 5 instead of a perfect score.\n\nThere are two things that keep me from going insane with joy over this title.  The biggest is the system they use for resurrection.  If you die, you respawn in the nearest tube, and continue on your way.  This means that some really difficult fights can be made much easier.  Simply drop your hammer, and die.  You respawn with half health, and rinse and repeat.  You could really go through the game without ever using a health pack if you were lazy enough.\n\nSecond is the interaction.  There's some great stuff, and when splicers started dieing on my poison health station, I was stoked.  However, I think it's odd that creatures don't come looking for you when you die.  You get to start over in regards to aggro, and with big daddies, get a free shot.\n\nPlease, however, don't let this make you think too badly of an otherwise next level game!;A great game!
46;34.0;5.0;7.0;Forget everything you've heard about any great 360 game to date, BioShock has taken that crown achievement for the moment. Whether it will weather the storms of Mass Effect, Halo 3 or Call of Duty 4 is yet to be seen though. I can tell you this, this game is going to likely be a most serious contender for game of the year!\n\nFor 360 owners, this game is all that and a bag of chips. If you own a 360, YOU MUST buy this game. The only people that will not find this game enjoyable at the moment will be the PS3 owners, who will likely get a taste later on down the road. But hey, who needs fantastic games for their $500-600 game console when they can just watch BluRay movies all day, right?;Simply amazing game!
4;35.0;3.0;5.0;"I've wanted to play this game for a long, long time. It's not because of 2K's marketing, but rather because of the longevity of this game's relevance in gaming community: whenever art in game is mentioned, this game is brought up as an examplary title that delivers meaningful and powerful experience.\n\nSo, having just finished the game, how do I feel about this game? Anything but impressed.\n\nThis feeling really isn't because all those who loved this game are necessarily wrong. Yes, it did have an interesting setting and the characters that can say a lot about the world in which we live in. However, the game does nothing unique (in terms of interactive media) to explore those very well. This may seem like a faulty observation to those who've played this game (the majority of play time is spent exploring Rapture, the underwater city in which the entire game takes place), but when I say explore, I don't just mean walking around from corner to corner physically; I mean to examine, interact and develop the experience in top of them. The city is in ruin, and does not change in any interesting way in response to your choice. Characters are nothing but voice records after records. While game's back story does explain the lack of interaction or other very unrealistic mechanics (especially the death mechanics), it serves only as an excuse than to add to the experience.\n\nAll in all, I was deeply disappointed at the caliber of meaningful experience this game had on its sleeve for me. It is an okay shooter, with okay graphics (although an awesome work considering it runs on UE2.5). It may be fun to fight your way through the city to the end of the game, but that's about it.";Good but not Interesting
12;36.0;3.0;6.0;"I bought into all the ""Game of the Year"" hype and played this game over the holidays. Yes, the graphics and art direction are beautiful, however the story and gameplay are nothing more than your standard cookie cutter shooter.";Overrated
20;37.0;2.0;6.0;I played the game for like an hour and had to turn it off.  The story line was a little too gruesome and disturbing for my taste.;Good game play...but disturbing story line.
24;38.0;5.0;6.0;I was talking to a friend of mine about the game recently and I think he summed it up best when he said, 'Everyone who owns a 360 NEEDS to have this game in their collection.'\n\nI could just leave the review off right there because there really isn't much more to say than that. When you play this, expect a single player experience rivalled only by a handful of other games.\n\nThe graphics are stupendous. Very few games have a level of immersion like this one. You'll play it and you will feel like you're deep under the ocean, exploring the city of Rapture.\n\nThe surround sound is top of the line. You'll be able to pinpoint the locations of anything that makes any kind of noise in this game easily. This is one to play with the volume all the way up. Oh yeah, hopefully your subwoofer can handle the thudding footsteps of the Big Daddies.\n\nThe controls are just right and are never frustrating. Little to say other than that.\n\nThe game itself is really in a class of its own. I love the mood that this game instills. It's tense to a point where I can safely say that this is one of the only games I've played where you dread turning the corner ahead of you. The intro to this game alone is simply jaw dropping and grabs you and doesn't let go from the outset. There are moments in this game that are literally terrifying. I'm not going to go on record as saying this is the scariest game I've ever played but it truly is an experience in fear and anxiety.\n\nThis is an instant classic and while there's no multiplayer, keep in mind that not every first person shooter was meant to be a fragfest. This one is about putting you in the middle of a terrifying scenario and making sure you believe you're actually there for every second that you're playing. Sure you can nitpick little things here and there but there's nothing in this game that comes even close to ruining the sheer perfection that is Bioshock.\n\nI can't recommend this title enough.;Bioshock: The Game You Must Own!
30;39.0;5.0;6.0;"If I could give Bioshock more than five stars, I would.\n\nThis is one of those rare games that is THE reason to buy an Xbox 360 if you haven't already. Halo did that for the first gen. Xbox ... now Bioshock comes along for the 360.\n\nLike other reviewers here, I've played virtually every FPS out there and Bioshock is at least one, if that not THE, best I've played.\n\nThe story is great, the characters (especially the Big Daddies) look amazing and the environments are breath-taking. Much like when I play Half-Life 2, I kept thinking to myself as I walked around Rapture, ""It would've been cool to see this place before it went to hell.""\n\nI LOVE games like this that totally absorb you and keep you wanting to play (I'm addicted, much to the chagrin of my wife). About half of the way through this game, I couldn't wait to start it over again so I could experience everything again.\n\nThe pluses: The idea of plasmids and tonics is insane ... love the fact that the conventional weapons are just that, conventional and not energy weapons ... the Art Deco look of Rapture ... damn. Oh wait, and you get to become a Big Daddy?!? Nice!\n\nOnly one true minus ... no multi-player. Would have been incredible to suit up against other people in these environments. But, I guess that's why this game is so good because the developers focused solely on the single-player. Here's hoping a multi-player add-on is coming.\n\nOK, maybe two minuses ... I haven't played in the most difficult setting, but in the default setting, it's almost too easy. Maybe I've played too many FPSs, but this wasn't that difficult once I got the hang of the controls. Will take another spin thru in the hardest setting and see how that is.\n\nUntil I played Bioshock, I thought Halo was the game by which all other FPS were going to be measured. Now, I'm not so sure ...\n\nI'm ready for Dreamland, Mr. Bubbles!";Oh ... my ... god ... easily Game of the Year
31;40.0;4.0;6.0;Bioshock is the greatest first-person shooter ever made, by quite a wide margin. But it is not a great game, merely a good one.\n\nThe story of Bioshock is passable, and while the style of exposition, in which the player learns more about the story by picking up and playing audio diaries, would have been a great addition to a game that was already story-based, it does not suffice to create a game that is story-based, on its own. There are virtually no cutscenes in the game, and while the diaries and radio transmissions are well-scripted and voiced, their characterization of the inhabitants of rapture quickly becomes redundant and superfluous, while their explication of the chain of events leading to the downfall of the attempted utopia remains oversimplified and unconvincing. Bioshock's is a story which ought to have been told from more angles.\n\nThe plot itself, while frequently advertised as revolutionary and ultimately surprising, seems literary only in comparison to those of other action video games, and if Bioshock were a screenplay for a feature film, the plot's resolution would almost certainly be rejected, not because of its self-proclaimed boldness, but rather because within the established canon of science fiction, it would be sen as hackeneyed beyond passability. There are four or five stories that have been told again and again in science fiction, with only the superficial details changed, and the story of Bioshock is one of these, verbatim.\n\nThe soundtrack to Bioshock is superb. Blasting one's way past drug-addled mutants in the ruins of restaurants and hospital waiting rooms, to the sound of pop hits from the 40's and 50's creates the kind of thematic redefinition of music seen in films such as David Lynch's Blue Velvet, and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. The art direction and virtual architecture in the game are also superb, but a couple of production issues detract from the player's enjoyment of being in Rapture. First, although the game supports surround sound, the direction of the speakers used to play the various sounds within the virtual environment, does not consistently correspond with the direction of their source, relative to the player. Being fired at from the left might result in the sound of gunfire being evenly mixed throughout all speakers, leaving the player with no audible clue as to the direction of the ambush. It is absurd for the game to support 5.1 and 7.1-channel sound, if it is not going to take advantage of obvious opportunities to use it. The second major technical flaw is in the lighting. Light sources in this game illuminate to an unrealistically high degree at close range, and an unrealistically low degree at long range. Frequently, a light bright enough to clearly illuminate its immediate surroundings, will not prevent a section of the same room, which is only fifteen feet away from the light, from remaining completely dark.\n\nThe gameplay is excellent, and although the enemies in this game are frequently stupid enough to come rushing into a corridor where they have you pinned, allowing you to engage them all from the front, rather than waiting in the adjacent open area for you to emerge from the corridor, the great physics in this game's combat more than compensate for the lackluster AI, which is partly explained by the game's story. There is a realistic feel to using the weapons, and at any given time, there are a few different feasible tactical approaches to combat, of which charging in Rambo-style is usually the worst. Compared to games like Resident Evil 4, there is almost an overavailability of ammo and healing items in this game, which makes returning through rooms that have already been cleared of enemies to scavenge for them, whenever the player has been weakened from battle, almost too powerful of a strategy, which detracts from the necessity to use ammo and Eve efficiently and take a minimal number of hits. There is also no penalty for dying in this game, but it's not as big of a problem as the overabundance of items, because players looking for a challenge can always choose to return to their last save position every time they die, rather than taking advantage of the infinite, free respawns which the game offers them.\n\nIf you're new to First-Person Shooters, this is a good game to start with, because it was designed to be finishable by almost anyone. If you like great stories, but for whatever reason, you never read or watch movies, then you might like this game for its story, because it is actually pretty decent by video game standards. If you're a hardcore gamer, you might like this game for a while, just because it's fun, and it has interesting level design and combat physics. And if you're a first-person shooter fan, you'll almost certainly like this game, because it excels in most areas, compared to other first-person shooters. I can't honestly think of many categories of gamers who wouldn't like this game at least a little bit. But like the majority of other games, it would be very hard to argue that this is a work of art, and harder yet to argue that it is an important one.;You call THAT tenderloin ???
35;41.0;5.0;6.0;"I enjoyed everyone's viewpoints in the Amazon reviews. I thought it would also help the potential buyer to know things about this game that aren't highly publicized, but are important to note.\n\nGraphics - It's been compared to Gears of War as either being better or almost as good. This really depends on your perspective. Both games actually run on the Unreal 3 engine. Both games run at high frame rates and almost never stutter. I think Gears might look a little crisper, but the artistic design and lighting from BioShock is currently unparalleled within the XBOX 360 realm.\n\nSound - In all of the games I have ever played (and I am sure there are games I am missing here), BioShock stands alone and has actually created it's own league. The 1940s music & score coupled with voice-acting that sounds like it's from a 1940s movie (as mentioned below), weapons/environment sounds, and 5.1 implementation are second to none at this point in the game development continuum.\n\nGameplay - Here is where I would like to share a different perspective. The save at any time functionality, to me, is a good thing. I know some folks don't like it and say it lessens the challenge. I believe if you are in that camp, you have the freedom of saving less frequently thereby personalizing the level of challenge that's right for you. I particularly don't like doing the same things 15 times until I get it right. This promotes frustration and not satisfying challenges. With BioShock it is a necessity to be able to save at any time because you can experiment with different solutions in dispensing enemies. Each option is a joy to experience. Another under-mentioned fact is that the load and save times last only seconds allowing the ""save at any time/point"" functionality to be practical. Some games have extremely long save and load times, making the ""save at any time/point"" functionality a mixed blessing. Also the controls, while not revolutionizing the FPS/RPG-lite genre, are super tight. The controller layout is well designed & implemented. All these little game-play tidbits combined make this game great and head and shoulders above 99% of the rest.\n\nStory -The story is on par with the God of War stories in that it takes an old idea/story (Greek mythology vs. Jules Verne) and creates something totally innovative, dark, and fresh.\n\nConclusion - This game is not Ninja Gaiden challenging, nor is it meant to be (Ninja Gaiden is awesome in it's own right). It is an experience that I believe really starts to straddle the line between a movie and a video game. I agree with Hieronymus below that no one will know what game-of the-year is until the year is up. This is going to be one of the greatest years to be a gamer in that there will be so many AAA quality titles released this fall/winter. It will be tough to manage your time and money on which games to own and play. Nonetheless, BioShock will surely be a top-tier contender and a must-own title for any XBOX 360 owner.";A Different Perspective
40;42.0;5.0;6.0;A franchise is born and its name is Bioshock! Games like this don't come along too often. At heart its a FPS ,but the added 'Bio' powers make this game truly shine. The first stage of the game is Linear somewhat a training session , then the levels open up into multiple pathways and areas to explore. There is a detective quality to this game if you wanna follow the story through audio diaries,PSA's, and generous bloody scribbles on the walls,or you can ignore them and simply kill everything in your way. This game gives you that option. But IMO the story makes this game top-notch , yeah sure its typical creepy fare, but hey its fun. With certain abilities (LT) you can set people on fire with your fingertips,use telekenesis ,and some others I won't spoil. Not to mention 2 endings worth a replay through or 2. There's not much I can say negative about this game other than it's about 20 hours long. Too short for my taste but its a rock solid 20 hours of fantastic gameplay. Aside from the widescreen fiasco , its in 16x9 widescreen at native 720p no stretching by the way. The games look beautiful and the camera is fully controllable like most FPS so for my HD LCDTV its looks fantastic .Im looking forward to Bioshock becoming a franchise with at least a sequel coming for it. This game is one heck of a joy-ride ,movie-like game experience. One that should not be missed. M rated lots of blood and gore not for the kiddies. PEACE.;MASTERPIECE!
43;43.0;5.0;6.0;Its beautiful, its sharp, its fast, and just very, very well done!!! Plus its pretty freaky and the amazing visual effects and voice work really pull you in!!! Don't rush around like a fool. Take a look around at EVERYTHING. Its all looks fantastic. The storyline keeps you wanting more and more. If I could... 10 stars!!!\n**I'm adding to this review now because I just finished the game for the first time around. I won't make you read much and I'll sum it up in a very short way... THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE** PERFECT!!!;THE AMAZING GAME WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
6;44.0;2.0;5.0;My husband and I are gamers and love great games..played many..and this one, oddly, since there is so much about it that would make you think it is great..and it is not. We tried to figure this out, but the one thing we came up with is regardless of the reviews, it was awful. Repetitive, if you like that, buy this game. It was a surprising disappointment..considering all the reviews...didnt make sense. Oblivion, ran true to reviews, even older ones like Morrowind...and many others. Bioshock, no way. Despite trying to even go along with some of the reviews about it being fantastic, we just can't. It just didn't win us over at all.;Doesn't Measure up to the Hype..disappointed
8;45.0;2.0;5.0;"To be honest, this game has great graphics, and interesting game play.  The first levels are really scary, exciting, and interesting.  But the game quickly becomes tedious.  Basically I played this game a couple of hours a day for about a week, I just couldn't take much more than that at a sitting.  Near the end it was pure tedium.  Some of the voice acting was great, and funny.  I liked Dr. Schulong, but I found the exposition provided by the tapes you find to be trite at best.  I kept thinking ""He wouldn't have stopped to carve aaaahhhhhgggggg."" Honestly why would the people in the game record their inner most thoughts and secrets?  Unlikely at best.  Compare this to HL2 where the exposition is through the environment, and I find the storytelling in HL2 to be much better accomplished.  Bioschock was too compressed, too much voice over exposition.  It makes you always feel claustraphobic.\n\nThe twist in the game was cleverly done.\n\nChance I will replay this game without becoming really annoyed?  0%";It was ok I guess.
29;46.0;5.0;5.0;This is an amazing game, one of the best for xbox360, and quite possibily the best single-player FPS of all time. Not only is this a killer shooter, but there are adventure and rpg elements like upgrading your weapons and abilities. Not to mention hacking security camera and cool stuff like that. There is really no other game like this, an original masterpiece.\n\nThe graphics are probably the best I've ever seen on any game for any system. No question. The amount of detail given to each room and every little object is amazing. This is truly a next-generation break-through. It runs on the Unreal Engine, which is the same as Gears of War and Rainbow Six: Vegas, so you know the graphics are nice.\n\nThe audio is probably even better than the graphics. Movie-quality voice overs, amazing music and realistic sound effects. With a good surround sound system you will really be able to hear every footstep and taunt. There are some really creepy ambient sounds too (if you like nightmares).\n\nBottomline, stop reading the reviews and just buy this game. Its gotten a solid 5 stars on Amazon, a bunch of the major review sites have given it a full 100% or 10/10. It doesn't get much better than this. This is a modern classic at its finest. Don't miss out.;Game of the  year - best game since Gears!!!
32;47.0;5.0;5.0;"This is a true next-generation game. The gameplay is smooth as glass, Xbox controller works perfectly. The graphics are incredible, as is the sound. Bioshock is a horror FPS with some RPG elements, as you get to customize your character as you play with plasmids and weapons.\n\nThere are a few holy-crap moments in the game, where the story turns and twists unexpectedly; if you're planning on playing this, avoid reviews & spoilers.\n\nBest game of the year so far, and probably for all of 2007!";If you have an Xbox 360, you MUST OWN this game
34;48.0;5.0;5.0;Deciding if this game was worth 5 out of 5 was really a no-brainer.  Having played lots of computer games and valued them for things like: atmosphere, intelligence, ability to create suspension of disbelief, graphics, intuitive gameplay, maturity, attention to detail, addictiveness, voice-acting, sound, action, scariness, soundtrack and style it scores at the highest level for each.  How many other games can claim that?\n\nBasically there are so many things to recommend Bioshock that it's hard to know where to begin.  Do you start with the fact that it's one of the best FPS on the market or just talk about the sheer amount of creativity fuelling the whole experience?  In this game you pump the buttons like any good shooter while having to think and even make limited ethical choices.  Plus there is a dialogue (if you're up for it) between yourself and a story that references everything from Ayn Rand and eugenics through to militant strikes and elitist propaganda.  Shoving in the near RPG level micromanagement of your character's abilities you really should be in clover here.  Bioshock tries to please everyone and pretty much manages to do so.\n\nThe story has you plunging into the city of Rapture--a decaying, undersea 40's style vision of the future--following a plane crash.  Once in you are initially led around via a radio link to one of its disillusioned inhabitants as you discover genetically altered `splicers' and a technology that seems culled from a lunatic meeting of H.G. Wells, J.G. Ballard and Phillip K. Dick.  Going further you also mutate and increasingly depend on bizarre chemicals to survive.  Soon it is becomes entirely commonplace to incinerate, freeze or telekinetically slaughter your enemies with a flick of your wrist.  Then of course there are the `Little Sisters' leeching from the corpses you've left behind, who you in turn need to leech from, while deciding if its right to kill them or save them.\n\nSo is this the perfect game?  Unfortunately the answer is no.  Rather than becoming more interesting (i.e., more creatively challenging) at the crucial pinch-points it runs back to dully launching large numbers of enemies at you and forgetting its IQ.  This soon gets to be irritating when you've been fully lost in the world and then frequently thrown out of it by crass stupidity.  It tends to leave a bitter taste in the mouth.\n\nSimilarly the game lacks any element of stealth, there are very few puzzles worth a mention, the respawn points are silly, the environments are often just background (indestructible light fixtures, etc), the AI can be uneven and the whole thing has quite openly begged, borrowed and stolen from other games.  If you've played a lot of shooters then you may be taking a tour down memory lane.\n\nThe final recommendation is that you should buy this gorgeous release even if it is flawed.  When playing through Rapture the problems that would sink an average title become niggles and minor complaints in an otherwise rewarding and completely entertaining experience.\n\nBioshock is undoubtedly one of the finest games ever made and it has set the benchmark that other companies will either meet, exceed or get nowhere near when releasing their own product.  It is an evolution in gaming such as befits the content that rightfully put it there.;Almost, nearly perfect
39;49.0;5.0;5.0;"I thought that 2K just killed it on sports games... I completely lucked into this one.  I'm not one to check up on games or read gaming sites - just happened to be in the store and saw this.  Heard the security guy at the entrance talking about it, and remembered that I had heard some mumbling about this on the NEWS (first clue).  So I picked it up - something I rarely do without knowing much about a game.  I honestly haven't played it as much as some of the other people here presumably have (yet), but from what I HAVE seen I can safely say this:  If you're a fan of FPS's, then this is a definite MUST OWN, right up there with Gears of War and Rainbow Six: Vegas.\n\nThe premise may still be a bit beyond my grasp for the moment; it's been mentioned in the other reviews TO DEATH, so I won't go into it further.  (most likely, if you're reading reviews on it, you've at least heard of the game and it's somewhat controversial moral judgment element)\n\nGraphically, it's AT LEAST the second prettiest game on the 360, maybe a a little ways off from Gears (arguably the prettiest-looking game to date) is... and definitely just as fun and scary/unsettling, if for completely different reasons.  The water effects in this game are second to none.  The sound is on par with that of Gears - which is extraordinary.  The interactive nature of your environment and the ingenuity of the gameplay push it over the top for me.\n\n**Look out for that Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare...  may have some competition for Game of the Year there.  Oh, and something about a Halo...**";Sorry PS3-only owners...
47;50.0;5.0;5.0;The story of Rapture and Bioshock is second to none. Im probably about 25% completed with the game right now, and it already beats out Gears of War in my opinion. The graffix, gameplay, story, etc, are all top tier. Rapture is so deep that Im still finding out new things every few minutes it seems. The single player campaign is just amazing... which is a good thing because Bioshock doesnt have a multiplayer. But, if you want the best multiplayer- get Gears. If you want an engrossing story and unique weapons/powers and story- get Bioshock. Unless you don't like FPS, of course. Even then, this does FEEL different than any other FPS Ive played thus far. Its definately different (I don't want to spoil anything, so my review can only be 'so' detailed). Bottomline- Recommended.\n\nEDIT: I have completed the game twice to get both endings... Man, they are pretty lame. I played this game for probably 40 hours total and it was worth it for sure (Im a family man, so this kind of time is abnormal). But for such a great game as it is- the endings fall short. It doesnt ruin the game one bit, but it does keep the game from being perfect. Its still recommended all the same, but the endings had to be mentioned- they are that bad. (9/10 score from me after completing the game). Not bad at all.;Almost Perfect FPS

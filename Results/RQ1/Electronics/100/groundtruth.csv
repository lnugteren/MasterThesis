37;1.0;3.0;631.0;I am rating this lens with only three stars because I am reviewing two lenses. Here is why:\n\nWhen I received my lens I later realized that I did not receive the extended three year warranty card that comes with the USA versions of the lens. Instead of just sending me the extended warranty card Amazon shipped me a whole new lens. Now while I was reading reviews prior to ordering this lens I had seen many reviews where the reviewer either loved this lens or they hated it. After a while I could see why...\n\nSome of the lenses that are being shipped are sharp all the way around while some are not sharp at all. Many claimed it was sharper at F:8 than F:4 while others said theirs was never sharp at all. Some complained about distortion and or dull or over saturated colors. I finally found a reviewer who had the opportunity to try 3-4 different lenses. They found that there seemed to be a lack of quality control all around when it came to this specific lens. Having a few days of both lenses I decided to compare them out for myself. I am glad I did.\n\nI put my camera in the front yard on a tripod and shot numerous sets of three for each lens at 10mm, 14mm, and 20mm. The results were surprising. The original lens I had been sent first was a clear winner. The trees and anything else around the picture were sharp, The replacement lens was anything but sharp. The colors on lens two were more vibrant than lens one but one can fix that with software where a blurred image is not really fixable.\n\nI shot numerous sets with both lenses and a few different F settings and the results remained the same. The replacement lens was the one being returned. Lucky for me the Sigma extended warranty cards have nothing on them, you enter the serial numbers yourself so I kept the card and returned the replacement lens.\n\nI have included two photos to the gallery for this lens so you can see what I found. In the end my first lens would have received a 5 star rating because they really are excellent lenses if you can get a good copy. The replacement copy would have received a 1 star rating. Luckily I had the chance to compare the two copies side by side or I may have never known just how bad lens number two really was.\n\nIf your lens has problems like lens number two you have a poor copy of the lens, return it. Sadly from all of the reviews I have read it seems that maybe 20% of the lenses are not good copies. Many just think poor sharpness is just a general lens limitation when chances are it is just a poor copy they received.\n\nBottom line!\n\n1. Get the lens out and shoot some shots, If it is not sharp around the edges return it for another copy.\n\n2. If you do not get your extended warranty card you may have gotten a gray market lens. Return it.\n\nUpon talking to a Sigma rep I was told they have no way to verify whether the lens is USA or Gray market (international) by the serial number, if you do not have the extended warranty card you will not get the warranty extension so buyer beware. The card is a card stock type black and red folded warranty card that specifically states that it is the extended warranty card. Don't let any dealer tell you that it has the extended warranty without it being in your hands. Sigma currently has no registration on their website. The rep told me to keep the card in a safe place and then in the event that I need service I will send it and a copy of the original sales receipt in with the lens for service.\n\nAll that being said I can tell you that this is a wonderful lens if you need a super wide angle lens and you get a good copy. They are not the fastest lenses around but for the money you cannot beat it.\n\nTake a look at the pictures I included for the lens and hopefully they will help you determine if you were lucky on the Sigma draw and give you an idea of what you need to check for.;Could be 1 Star, Could be 5 Stars!

5;2.0;5.0;8.0;This was the first wide angle lens I got, I bought it to use on my D5200. Now i still use it on my D750 even though it is for a crop sensor.\n\nThe lens itself is fairly heavy, it's pretty solid too.\n\nThere is some distortion when you get all the way down to 10,11, maybe even 12mm.\n\nIt's also quite sharp, not the sharpest lens, but for the price it's a competitor with some of the big dogs.\n\nI'd recommend this lens to anyone looking to get into landscapes, I've gotten some of my best shots with this lens.;One of the best starter wide angles!
95;3.0;5.0;374.0;"I went into a local camera store to look at the Nikon 12-24mm wide angle zoom to eventually augment the Nikon 50mm 1.8 and 18-200mm VR I currently use on my D200.  After seeing the Sigma 10-20mm, taking test shots with it and the Nikon, and then printing the shots in the store, I walked out with the Sigma lens.\n\nI had planned to buy the 12-24mm Nikon next Spring when my budget would allow the expenditure.  I have had success with Nikon optics in the past - starting with my first Nikon FM back in the seventies.  The Sigma's good construction, nice finish, smooth+fast+quiet focusing and 10mm focal length convinced me to try my first non-Nikon lens in 30 years. A big factor: The Sigma lens is less than half the price of the Nikon lens here is Canada.  It fit my budget, so I took the plunge.\n\nThe Sigma fits into my ""sharp enough""  category.  In real world shooting, its sharpness is on par with my 18-200mm Nikon. Both lens are less sharp than my $100 50mm 1.8 when ""test"" images are blown up to 16""x20"" size. I never notice any lack of sharpness in  ""real"" pictures.  I care more about color saturation, contrast and color balance anyway.  In this area, the Sigma does well.  Saturation and contrast are equal to both my other Nikon lens - particularly at f8 and smaller aperatures.  Wide open, I find some weakening in contrast.  The Sigma has a warmer color termperature than my other lens.  One click toward blue in Photoshop would fix this minor variance in color.  But I use my 10-20mm almost exclusively for landscapes.  The warmer color is generally a good thing.\n\nI have noticed some vignetting @ 10mm f4.  Zooming to 12mm or stopping down to f5.6 elminates any artifacts in pictures I have taken thus far.  I have found it's more important to avoid ""thick framed"" filters - and stacking filters is a no no with this lens.  They cause more darkening than a wide open f-stop.  BTW: I added a 72 to 77mm step-up ring to my 18-200m VR Nikon to allow me to share filters between my zoom lens.\n\nI do miss having a manual/autofocus switch on the Sigma lens.  I have accidently nudged the manual focus ring a couple of times.  With that said, the incredible depth of field of this lens (or any lens at this focal length) means small focusing errors can be tolerated :)\n\n I recommend this lens - even to people like me, who never had a non-nikon lens before.";I didn't plan on buying this lens but I am glad I did
1;4.0;5.0;316.0;there are currently 4 wide angle zoom choices available on the EF-S canon mount (d-rebel/xt/20d)  canon 10-22, Sigma 12-24, sigma 10-20, tokina 12-24.  Of these, sigma 12-24 is the only one which is usuable on a full frame sensor (canon 1d, 5d, possible future cameras).  There is sizable difference in field of view between the 10 mm, and 12 mm.  and the tokina is closer to 13 mm on its wide end.  The sigma retails for about 2/3 the price of the canon.  Optically they are very similar, with the canon having a larger maximum aperature, which is generally not important in a wide angle lens.  The built construction is EX, they higher line of sigma, and it excellent.  The focus motor is HSM, making it fast, and very accurate.  Resolution chart show the sharpness to be very close to that of canon.  The color and contrast is excellent, the flare and chromatic abberation genenrally well controlled.  A fun lens to use, and excellent value.;best value wide angle.
72;5.0;5.0;79.0;"Before purchasing this lens, I looked at the Nikon 12-24 and the tokina 12-24.  Both were more expensive, and claimed to be be excellent performers.  After comparing all three, the Sigma 10-20 was the hands down winner in my book for a number of reasons.\n\n1. Packaging - Came in a very attractive box with a manual and included not only a lens hood, but a very nice lens case!  Good Job Sigma!\n2. Build - The lens feels tough and has a very attractive finish to it.  The focus ring is nicely dampened and is very easy to modulate.  My only gripe is that the lens cap is useless, get a nikon lens cap and you're all set.\n3. Performance - The sigma is 2mm wider than its nikon and tokina counterparts and boy does it make a difference.  The FOV is wide on my D50 and i can capture so much on one single shot that when people see them, their first words are ""how the hell..."".  Distortion at the wide end is there, but is easily controllable through precise leveling or from post processing.  You might see some vignetting at 10mm but just stop it down and you should be all set (or you can correct it with a click of the mouse in photoshop).  I have heard complaints about sigma not having a constant aperture.  In my opinion, who the hell needs it.  When I am taking shots in the day, the natural light is sufficient enough.  For night shots, i use a tripod and usually stop it down to F8-f10 where the sigma's optical performance is at its best.  This is an amazing piece of glass and I encourage those looking for a wide angle lens to definintely take the sigma into consideration.  Looking at Sigma's future lens lineup, I don't consider them to be a 'third party' lens company anymore.  Sigma will definitely be considered on my next purchase for a telephoto lens.";EPIC LENS
98;6.0;5.0;81.0;I have been shooting for about eight months now. i was torn between the sigma and the nikon. I read several reviews and wnet to a camera store and tested both lens and enlarged them in photoshop. I love the sigma. It is wider, less CA and seems like less barrell. It is as sharp as the nikon, the only downside is that there is light fall off when the lens is wide open at 10mm. It is very noticable, so i just stop down to 7.1 or 8 and the problem is fixed. The sharpness is clear through the whole picture. For the price it can not be beat. I would rate this lens equal with the nikon 12-24. I see no advantage to going with the nikon over the sigma unless you like the constant 4 and minor light fall off when wide open, easily fixable.;sigma vs. nikon 12-24
0;7.0;5.0;74.0;"If you are looking good quality and price ultra wide lens for APC-C senser size digital SLR, this lens is a very good choice. Canon also has an EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens. However the price is more than $700. Here is a Sigma, 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM. Sure it's little bit dark than Canon, but it's OK. Usally ultra-wide lens are used at outdoor. The photo is very sharp image and you can take a shot without cropping. And minimum focusing distance if 9.4"" (24cm), you can make fun photos! Sigma also provice lens hood and carring case for free!";Very good ultra wide lens for Canon Digital SLR 300D 350D 10D 20D Rebel XT
65;8.0;5.0;64.0;I wanted an ultra wide angle lens for my new Canon EOS 40D, but I didn't have the money to purchase a high cost Canon ultra wide lens.  Careful research kept pointing to the Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DS HSM lens.  At 4 to 5.6, this lens is slightly dark, but for an outdoor lens I figured lighting wouldn't be much of an issue.  With a range of 10 to 20mm I decided this lens would offer very wide shots and near fish-eye creativity capabilities.\n\nI always buy only Canon lenses, but I don't buy the professional level models.  After all, I am a photo hobbyist, not a professional photographer.  Well even though I really wanted to purchase a quality ultra-wide angle lens, I was low on funds due to recently over spending on Christmas gifts for my friends and family.  Although I wanted to buy a Canon ultra-wide, I just didn't have that kind of cash.  I read several rave reviews on this Sigma 10-20mm lens so I ordered one up.  I haven't had it very long but I have taken several photos with this lens and so far I am quite impressed.  At 10mm you do get some curved distortions, giving a bit of a fisheye effect.  This can be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for in your shot.  As another reviewer pointed out, this effect can make clouds look wonderful.  This is an EX series Sigma, with a super fast HSM auto focus.  The focusing is quick and accurate.  The filter size is 77mm, which is HUGE, and filters can be quite expensive, but for what you save on the cost of the lens you can afford to invest in quality UV and polarizer filters.  This lens is also fairly light weight and very classy looking.  The shiny gold ring is a nice touch indeed.  I also really love the fact that this lens comes with a lens hood and a nice padded case.\n\nI only have a couple of minor complaints, neither of which would cause me to reduce my rating.  First and most distracting is the fact that the focus and zoom rings are reversed, compaired to the Canon lenses, so I find myself constantly adjusting focus when I mean to adjust zoom.  This is something that I will get used to and certainly does not affect the overall quality of the lens.  Secondly, with the lens stored in its squarish, padded case, it makes the whole package a bit large and I cannot fit it in my camera bag.\n\nSo, with all of this being said I have to give this Sigma EX series 10-20mm lens a solid 5 stars.  The optics produce quality photographs, the overall feel of the lens is perfect, and the price is substantially less than the closest Canon equivalent.  5 stars may seem a bit high to some people, who feel that only the most perfect, professional lenses deserve this high of a score.  But I feel that the quality and performance of this lens merrits a perfect score.  For the average consumer photographer there just isn't a better ultra-wide lens on the market today.  It even scores better than the Canon ultra-wides!  I couldn't be happier with my new Sigma EX 10-20mm, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent ultra-wide lens.;High Quality Doesn't Have to Equal High Cost
84;9.0;5.0;56.0;"This 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera, so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. I was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear, which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. It is a well-made lens, made with high-grade materials. What this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes, close-quarters interior photography, and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces (and is typical of wide-angle lenses). You can also get close to the subject as well: 5 inches from subject to the front surface of the lens. By the way, if you're going to photograph in Big Sky Country, this is the one lens you can't leave home without. And, I suggest purchasing a graduated neutral density filter to balance out the luminance range between the sky and the landscape below. This great lens package comes with front & rear lens cap, lens hood, and a very nice cushioned & zippered lens pouch!";The Lens for Big Sky Country
93;10.0;5.0;53.0;(also posted for the Canon version)\n\nI have been using the lens with my Nikon D70 for over a year, and I am very happy with it. I use the lens for most of my day to day shooting.\n\n(+) 10mm focal length - Yee haa! One year after, and I still can't get the smirk off my face. Even with the accompanied pincushion distorsion (see below) the 10mm focal length is simply a joy (Nikon's zoom only goes as wide as 12mm, 12 is noticable narrower than 10).\n\n(+) Optical quality - is very good as far as I can judge. There is a pretty noticeable pincushion distorion at the 10mm end, but I understand all ultra-wide zooms suffer from the same phenomena. The distorsion at 12mm focal length is far less noticable.\n\n(+) Build quality - no complaints. except for this lens I also own Sigma's 30mm f/1.4 lens (which has disappointing optical performance IMO). 30mm's optical issues aside, - both feel solid and stable, no loose rings or levers or anything like that. Sigma does an excellent job here.\n\n(+) HSM focusing works very well, my guess is that Nikon would be as good or perhaps slightly better. One of the other non-Nikon alternative uses the screwdriver blade type auto focus rather than ultrasonic motor (the built it ultrasonic AF is way nicer to use).\n\nAll the negatives or 'cons' if you will, are right there in the data sheet, no unpleasent surprises whatsoever. The lens is big and heavy but so is the competition (Nikon). I wish it could go a little further to say 22mm or 25mm, but again - I knew it won't, before I bought it. As a Nikon owner I don't really think there a significantly better choice, if you own a Canon DSLR body though, then the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens may be a better choice.\n\n5 start with no hesitation, no other DSLR lens I know gives so much value for the money! (except, perhaps, for that 10-22 canon lens, which is the forbidden fruit for us Nikonians).;An awesome lens

25;12.0;1.0;35.0;"I really wanted this lens to work out for me. I received the lens, took a few test shots, viewed them on my computer and noticed that one side was significantly more out of focus than the other. My first thought was ""user error,"" so I tried again, using a tripod, several different focal lengths and apertures...same result. Amazon generously sent me a replacement, and I repeated the test. This time, I had 2 lenses on hand. The new lens had the distortion on the opposite side. Amazon sent me a third lens. I repeated the test with all three lenses. Each lens had major distortion issues, including CA, in different areas. Each lens was consistent in its results, leading me to doubt that my results were due to user error. I am aware of the distortion caused by wide angle lenses, but this was unacceptable. I am now clearly aware of the quality control issues of Sigma lenses. Each of the three lenses was so different in the location and type of distortion, as well as overall quality of images, that I returned them all. As usual, Amazon was most helpful!";Did not work for me.
81;13.0;5.0;42.0;Fantastic Lens. I received my Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens from Amazon yesterday. I did a lot of research prior to buying this lens. My primary concern was that the lens might be a bit too wide and lead to too much distortion. I was wrong. The lens offers incredible quality from 10mm to 20mm. It's quiet, focuses quickly and feels rock solid. So far, I'm very satisfied.\n\nCanon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR\n\n  Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens\n\n  Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM Standard Zoom Lens\n\n  Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG APO Macro Telephoto Lens\n\nAll equipment purchased at Amazon.com;Fantastic Ultra Wide Angle Lens
53;14.0;5.0;39.0;"I'm a nut for wide-angle photography. I don't mean to get technical, but for those who do not know the sticky details, modern Digital SLRs often have sensors that are quite a bit smaller than the traditional exposure area of film: 24mmx36mm. In the case of Nikon DSLRs (all current models except their $5000&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikon-D3-12-1MP-FX-Digital-SLR-Camera-Body-Only/dp/B000VRV6LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)</a>&nbsp;professional FX sensor model) use what they call a DX sensor which is 16mmx24mm.\n\nFor us old film hounds, this means that a lens of a given focal length will roughly translate to 1.5x when switching from film (of Full frame) to DX. So, your old 20mm wide angle lens will ""crop"" to about the equivalent of a 35mm lens when put on a DX sensor DSLR.\n\nFor those who really like telephoto shots, this is a positive boon. Your 300mm lens will take pictures that have the same angle of view as a 450mm lens, but for those of us wide-angle freaks, this ""digital crop factor"" takes some of the ""punch"" out of the bottom end. Many general-use zooms for the DX sensor cameras start around 18mm. This would be ultra-wide on that old film camera, but it takes pictured that look more like what you'd expect from a 28mm lens on a traditional film camera.\n\nOk, sorry for all the mumbo jumbo, but now on to why this lens is so great...\n\nWith its 10mm-20mm focal length, this lens is the 35mm film SLR equivalent of a 15mm to 35mm zoom lens, and 15mm full-frame is about the widest you can go before getting into ""fish-eye"" territory.\n\nWith this Sigma lens at 10mm, you get a very wide angle perspective without crossing over into fish-eye territory. Yes, there is noticeable ""barreling"", but nothing beyond the range of most modern photo/image editing software's ability to fix. Frankly, I like a little of that in my ultra-wide photos. At the 20mm end, the ""barreling"" is much less noticeable.\n\nAs will all extreme wide angle lenses, if you get right on top of your subject, you'll really amplify the distortion effect, but if you're shooting at 10mm and focusing down to the lenses minimum focus distance (an amazing 10"" or so), you're probably already expecting, and even counting on such distortion anyway.\n\nDid I mention that it focuses down to around 10""?\n\nThe construction of this lens is solid, and it has a little heft to it. It comes with its own custom lens hood. USE IT. The front element on this lens bulges out a bit (as you can see from the product photos), and aside from helping with lens flare, that extra bit of ""guard rail"" will help you avoid scratching the thing. I've put a UV filter on the front to help protect the glass, but the distance between that glass and the front lens element makes this ""reflection box"" that has visibly shown in some of my highly backlit/highly contrasty photos.\n\nThe focusing is fast and silent. I really like the fact that this is one of those ""internally focusing"" lenses which means that the act of focusing does not turn the manual focus rung, and doesn't make the lens change position or size. More importantly, if you want to manually focus, you can just grab the ring and turn because it's not ""locked"" into place in AF mode like many other lenses.\n\nI've taken some of my best photos with this lens, and for the wide-angle enthusiast with a DX sensor Nikon DSLR, I'd go so far as to say this is a must-have. It's got 2mm wider focal length than the nearest Nikon (with DOES make a visible difference at the low-end), but its incredibly well made and clear from edge to edge (though, it does have that ""barrel"" distortion... it's still crisp from end to end with little to no vignetting)\n\nSorry, I probably went on a bit, but as you can tell, I really like this lens. I'd highly recommend that you do your research before you buy it as ultra-wide angles do have some idiosyncrasies, but if you know what to expect (photographically) from them, then this lens is one of the best I've ever played with/owned.";A Must-Have for Wide Angle Enthusiasts with DX Nikon DSLRS
48;15.0;1.0;33.0;After shooting about a hundred initial photos on my a300, I noticed that the images weren't as sharp as the high reviews led me to expect. Thinking my lens had sub-par optics, I ordered a replacement from Amazon. Same story with second copy. I then set up a shoot-off between my Sony 16-105 and the two Sigma copies. Shots were of an old picket fence and a fruit basket, at 16 and 20mm with f-stops at wide open, f8 and f22. Auto focus center-weighted. Distance 1 meter. During this test, I realized that the Sony was auto-focusing to one meter, while the Sigmas read just over a meter.  I double checked my distance and then manually focused the Sigmas to 1m. Pics were great. When allowed to auto-focus, the Sigmas consistently read just past 1m. Reviewing my earlier shots which seemed soft revealed this back-focusing was the true culprit.\n\nLastly, I compared the Sony 16-105 to my Sigma 50mm 2.8 EX macro using the same process described above. The Sigma 50mm auto-focused perfectly and is easily the most detailed lens I have. I've also used other Sony lenses, as well as a Minolta 200mm 2.8, with no auto-focus issues. Given the solid reviews of the 10-20mm, I can only assume I fell victim to a bad lot. Amazon was great to work with and refunded my money. I'll wait a few months and order another. If that lens is good, I'll amend my review. Sorry for the long post, but since I'm dinging a well reviewed lens, I thought I should be specific.;Bad lot? Auto-focus chronically back-focuses on a300
10;16.0;5.0;19.0;"First off, to understand the context of this review, I consider myself an average beginner photographer. I take time to try and think about the pictures I take but I'm still not that good.\n\nI felt like I had hit a plateau with the kit lens that came with my D3200. I wasn't able to get any stunning landscape photos with the stock 18-55mm kit lens. For the most part, I wasn't really noticing that I couldn't compose the photo (when I was in the process of shooting) but when I got the pictures on the big screen, the photos just never awed me.\n\nI started to realize that my plateau might be due to my lens. I was traveling through Utah in Caynonlands & Arches National Parks with a friend of mine who is a much better photographer (and who has invested significantly more money in his photo hardware). He was shooting all his landscapes with his 10-22mm wide angle. I never quite stopped to think that a wide angle would be so good for landscapes, but when we reviewed our pictures, it was like night and day. I shot all weekend on my kit lens and he shot all on his wide angle. His pictures were significantly better enough that I bought this lens.\n\nI have to say that I love this lens. I don't really have anything technical to back up this statement. I just know that my landscapes come out SOOO much better now. I have found that I shoot landscapes almost always at the widest 10mm setting. The photos are nice and sharp, the focus works as well as it needs to and the photos come out great. If you are considering this lens for outdoor landscapes, you shouldn't feel too limited by the f/4-5.6. I've never had an issue with needing a faster lens; however, I haven't really tried to shoot outdoor landscapes at night yet. I personally would not think it's necessary to spend twice as much for the Nikon lens.\n\nHope this review helps. I'm going to post a couple of my favorite pictures on the user images page. You won't regret getting this lens.";Awesome landscape lens
86;17.0;5.0;35.0;10mm for the Sigma versus 12mm for the Nikon, and it costs around half as much. Done deal.\n\nHSM is great for focusing, and works on my D40 which only supports AF-S type lenses. 5.6 on the narrow end is unfortunate, but you don't buy this lens to shoot at 20mm. You can handhold wide-angles at slower shutter speeds anyways. The lens cap is once again Sigma end-pinch, which I quickly replaced with a Nikon center-pinch, a practice I've begun with all my Sigmas. Be aware that there are optical distortions in most wide-angle lenses, but most of the time they aren't much of an issue. When they are, an application like PTLens does a great job of fixing it up.\n\nI've really become a fan of Sigma lenses, they seem to offer such a great value. I'm sure the Nikon is probably slightly sharper, but I don't see a noticeable difference. I can see the difference between 10mm and 12mm, though, along with the over $400 difference.;WIDE!
99;18.0;5.0;32.0;After purchasing a Nikon D70S with the Sigma 18-200mm lens, I recently purchased a Nikon D200 and a Sigma 10-20mm ultra wide lens. This lens is one of the best I have ever used on any kind of camera. It not only has a good professional look and feel to it, but it works flawlessly with the smoothness of lenses in a much higher price range. Images are clean and crisp, and the autofocus is butter smooth. I paid a bit over $500 for mine and I doubt there is a nickels worth of difference, except in price, between the Sigma brand and a comparable lens bearing the Nikon name. This lens is a keeper for sure!!;Two Thumbs Up!!
4;19.0;5.0;32.0;This lens was something that I was not going to buy.  I tried it out and found that the range was incredible and the quality was what you expect from Sigma.  It was worth it for me!!!  Worked perfect on my D70!!!;Better then I expected!!!
76;20.0;5.0;29.0;After a lot of research on the net, I opted for the sigma over the canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM for my 1.6x crop camera....and I'm very happy with my choice. Here's why: 1)I'm a beginning hobbyist and had a hard time justifying the significantly increased cost of the canon. 2)The concensus seems to be that, though the canon is slightly better overall, it's not so obvious to most of us in day to day shooting 3)UWA is not my primary zoom range. Most pics I take (so far) have been in the 18-55mm range (so I did spring for the higher quality canon in that range) 4) Many of the differences in quality can be narrowed with photoshop 5)The sigma comes with a lens hood and a nice carrying case 6)The lens feels and looks high quality and the AF is quiet and fast (at least enough for me) 7) the pics are awesome and it's just a really fun lens to shoot with. Bottom line is I can't usually tell the difference unless it's pointed out to me on one of those sites that puts the lens through a series of controlled lab tests and a detailed pixel-peeping analysis (if you don't know what I'm talking about, I would suggest doing a little more research). So unless price is no object, you're a pro, or you frequently shoot in the UWA range, I would get the sigma. It's a great lens for me (but I'm no pro).;Ultra Wide Angle is the new telephoto!!
16;21.0;5.0;22.0;I'm a realtor and want to take wide angle pictures of my listings. This lens is just what the doctor ordered. I have a Nikon D3000 and it was a snap to switch out the lenses from the one that came with the camera,(18mm-55mm)to this lens. Some shadowing in the bottom center if the room is not lit appropriately and the flash is used - but that is an issue with the lighting not the lens/camera.  I am retaking all the pictures for my listings in the next week and cant wait to get them uploaded to the internet.;Just what I needed!
59;22.0;5.0;27.0;"I am shocked about this lens. After many visits to the camera store, hours of internet research, and dozens of questions to professionals I bought this lens from Amazon. No local dealers bothered to carry it so once again the sale went to the internet.\n\nDuring my research it became obvious that one of the major limitations of many new DLSR's is a smaller overall field of view when compared to a traditional film based SLR using the same basic lens. Without going into the ""why"" the bottom line is my Nikon D40X's stock 18-55 cannot capture as wide a shot as I want.\n\nTerminology becomes an issue when trying to explain this lens to an amateur, or the person who might be involved with your new 500 dollar purchase. The word ""wide"" has new meaning these days when applied to TV's and monitors, so people are confused when you try to tell them about a lens that is ""wide"". This is significant because so many new D40X buyers, for example, are jumping into SLR for the first time and have no clue about lenses. These are the people who probably have no idea what they are missing.\n\nThe overall focus on lenses gets further confusing for amateurs because of all the hype about ""zoom"", and when kits like the D40X give you an extra zoom but no wide lens. Zoom is like one of those numbers consumers make sure to ask about before they make their purchase. While zoom photography is cool, I feel the magic of wide-angle photography is a well kept secret. Consumers would be well served to be asking about ""wide"" instead, and start walking the camera up closer to their subject. You'll see why later.\n\nDoing research became even harder when I began to read about the Nikkor 12-24 and new 14 wide angle lenses. At $1000 and $1700 I began to feel like my dream would never come true. Then I held the new 14mm at the camera store, attached to a D60. It is a monster in every way. After looking at some dinky conversion lenses I was ready to give up. The amazing reviews of the new Nikon wide-angle lenses left me feeling it might be years away.\n\nThat's when I found the Sigma 10-20, roughly 5 lenses later. The solid 5 star reviews combined with under-$500 price tag got me looking, and then the test shots. $20 of overnight shipping later I must say this is a product that should come with the camera. All new consumers should be made aware of what this thing can do. It should be bundled or at least sold beside these cameras, not the total mystery it seems to be. This wide angle lens should go into the hands of amateurs and professionals alike. It could be the factor that keeps new people into the hobby when their zoom shots are all messed up. Simply put this lens allows your camera to better match what you see with your eyes. The creative possibilities of a wider field of view should not be underestimated. It could sell more cameras, so it seems the competition should be looking up to Sigma, especially at this price tag. Have fun!";This Should Come With Your Camera
8;23.0;5.0;11.0;I need the widest lens I can get without barreling like mad. I bought the first lens used for $300 (same model but older) but it did not communicate with my Nikon D5100 so I returned it. For another $100 I got a one new, properly tuned and with the full warranty. I was unsure as to whether buying another one was a good idea but the price point is very attractive, especially considering I don't need to spend much on a lens right now. Tamron or Tokina glass is at least another $100-200 and the Nikon is twice the price. None of them match the wide spec this one has, and I don't really need anything much tighter than this lens offers. Preliminary shots impressed me. It focuses properly and although there is some distortion at wide, it's not terrible and quite fixable with PS Elements. I plan to use it for my fledgling real estate photography sideline.\n\nUpdate: Significant distortion is apparent at wide focal length and aperture and requires correction. However, many realtors want me to use a 10mm lens so this is it and it still beats using a cell phone by a long shot.\n\nAnother Update: I suppose this is Photo 101 but if you shoot on a level, straight-ahead axis (that is, avoiding up or down tilting), results are very acceptable and distortion is minimized. In some instances the up/down tilt distortion actually improves things by exaggerating the field of view.\n\nGood lens for the dough.;So far so good
23;24.0;1.0;22.0;I purchased this lens as I have several Sigma  lenses of superior quality that I use for professional purposes.  I was very disappointed in the optical quality of this lens.  It had all the features, the right design, operation, but in the end,  the images were just not sharp.  Not at all what I expected from a Sigma product.\nThere were plenty of reviews of this lens and many talked of the poor image quality.  I decided to buy anyway, and unfortunately proved the negative reviews to be correct.\n\nI won't bore you with technical details,  Simply put,  I shot some test images,  put em on the computer screen and saw how fuzzy they were,  just awful. I did not need to measure or rate anything.  My eye ( and my clients would be able to ) see the fuzz without having to enlarge the image. I hate to say it as I have had good success with Sigma,  but this lens would be an assignment killer.  It reminded me of the cheap Promaster lenses you used to get for $69.00 from Ritz.\n\n  Thankfully Amazon has a good return policy so I was able to return it.  A week later I got the Nikon 10.5mm prime f2.8 (about $220 more) and found it was worth the extra money.  I know I am comparing a zoom to a prime,  but the difference is incredible. If your budget is limited I would look to a Tamron or other 3rd party lens,  if you have the extra scratch, get the Nikon 10.5mm f2.8  or take a look at the Nikon Extreme wide angle zooms. I assume for Canon shooters, the quality results would be similar,  look again to other 3rd party or Canon lenses.;Not a Buyer
30;25.0;4.0;23.0;If you're shooting landscape, this lens is an absolute must have -- stick it on a tripod, set it at f/8 and you're golden.  Auto-focus is fast and accurate and doesn't have an issue focusing on objects that are close up.\n\nThat being said, when it comes to people, it's a little more problematic.  Even at 16-17mm, you get distortion at the edges, so if you're shooting groups, they will be stretched/elongated.  The good news is that, at 20mm, it's fairly unnoticeable.  So, if you're shooting more formal pictures, rack the lens out to 20mm and move your body or tripod.  If you're shooting something more action oriented like urban, extreme sports -- snowboarding/skateboarding, etc, then the distortion might actually add to the photos.;Awesome Landscape Lens - Careful with People, Though!
97;26.0;5.0;25.0;"This is my new favorite lens!  This lens is sharp at all apertures and takes stunning photos.  10mm is super-fun and I'm having a great time taking wide angle shots.  I find that this lens is on my camera most of the time now.  Keep in mind, this lens is designed for cameras with a crop-factor- so Canon 5D owners need to look elsewhere.\n\nAlso, if you plan on using a flash (430EX/580EX) the use of the built in diffuser panel is a must.  If not, the edges of your pictures will be under exposed.  With the use of my 430EX (diffuser panel deployed), I'm able to take stunning super-wide angle flash shots.  Outside/non-flash, color-reproduction is excellent.\n\nThe built of this lens is ""sturdy.""  It looks and feels like a mini tank.  It is an EX series lens, so it has the durable black coating which is found on it's big brother- the Sigma 70-200 (another lens which I own and highly reccomend).\n\nI have purchased other lenses from Sigma's other third-party competitor and have been let down.  I can't be happier with either of my Sigma lenses.\n\nI highly reccomend this lens.  It is my new favorite and is almost ALWAYS on my camera.";Sigma 10-20mm
57;27.0;5.0;22.0;"After shooting a few months with the kit lens (18-55), I found myself shooting at the wider range more often than not, with the exception of the occasional portrait. So I got rid of the kit lens, got myself a 50mm prime (the f1/4 from Canon: a masterpiece), and a wide-angle zoom for landscapes.\n\nI quickly found and bought the Sigma. Two months later, I couldn't be happier. It shoots where no other lens could shoot. Everyone knows that ""10mm is wide"", but few realize just how wide it is until they see it. Our eyes see in the 40-50mm range, so we're not used to perceiving such a wide field. When you look through this lens, you see pictures that you didn't even know were there.\n\nThe glass quality is excellent, obviously not up to Canon L standards, but that was never the purpose. The pictures are SHARP and clear, and colors are excellent (tints tend slightly toward the warmer end when compared to Canon's 10-22mm; I like that, personally, but YMMV).\n\nSubjects are obviously deformed when shot up close at 10mm, but know what you're doing and that becomes a great tool for artistic pictures! You can shoot a 5'5"" person head to toes from less than 3 feet away. Also, I am happy to report that at 20mm there is NO distortion whatever, regardless of the subject's distance.\n\nThe only problem I can see right now with this lens is a rainbow effect when shooting at 10mm in direct sunlight. The hood helps some, but you'll still get the rainbow in some pictures. See my pic in the customer image section. It's not a huge deal (sometimes it's actually a neat effect), and it's happened to me only once out of 800+ pictures taken, but know what you're getting.\n\nOverall, this is THE wide-angle zoom to get if you're halfway serious about landscape photography, although the Sigma also works great in indoors with limited room to shoot.";Great and affordable wide angle!
80;28.0;5.0;23.0;I was not sure when I ordered this lense what to expect, thinking if I don't like the results, I can return it. I think I am keeping it. I was a non believer, now I am a believer. I did a lot of research as others did and I was a canon lense person all the way.  This is a very nice lense good value for the dollar. It feels well made a little heavy but not too heavy, Focuses quick and is quiet.\n\n  I was at a car show today and took about 150 shots with my 30D, the color was vibrant and the pictures were sharp and clear. I don't use a wide angle enough to justify the canon price, but i think I will be using this more than I expected. If you want a good wide angle lense at a good price for a cropped sensor camera, this is it.;Excellent Lense!!!!!!!!!  Once a Non-believer ,now a Believer
7;29.0;5.0;9.0;When I first bought this lens almost a year ago I wasn't sure what I thought about it.  I bought it for landscape and it did it's job capturing the beauty of Yellowstone on our honeymoon but I was new to photography and didn't really know how to use it to it's full potential.  I've spent the last year learning to shoot in manual mode and now that I have more experience I've found that there are so many more uses for this lens than just landscape!  I LOVE this lens!  But it took committing to shooting exclusively with it to find it's sweet spot for my style.  So for now I've ditched my prime lens and will continue to use my Sigma wide angle.  Images are sharp, and the distortion is just right while still achieving the bokeh you want for those portrait photos.  Great lens for the price.;So much more than landscape.

2;31.0;4.0;24.0;I replaced my 19-35mm lens with this on my digital rebel and, boy, it's nice to be back into wide angle.  For the price, it's a great lens (good build quality and focus-ability).  I'm not a lens expert, so I can't really comment on the image quality other than: it's great to me.  It comes with a nice lens pouch too (even though I never use them).  A couple minor issues: 1) I have the wasia hack and a couple of the settings cause the autofocus and aperture readout to non-function (I thought it was defective until I disabled the hack settings).  2) I wish the distance markings were in smaller increments (not a big deal though, since the autofocus works well).  These two things are the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars.;finally....a wide angle lens
96;32.0;5.0;23.0;After switching to a D70 from my previous 20-year old Minolta X700s, one of which had a Sigma 24mm almost permanently attached, I treated myself to this lens and am very favourably impressed. The build quality is excellent and the image quality is even better than I expected for the price. The images are somewhat warmer than I get from my Nikon 18-70mm and 70-300mm zooms but this is definitely nothing that worries me. Distortion is obvious at the 10mm end (as you would expect) but, again, less than I would have expected and not at all objectionable.\n\nOverall, I am delighted with this lens and can heartily recommend it to anyone needing ultra wide angle coverage.;A fabulous lens for the price
88;33.0;4.0;22.0;"I've been using the Sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and I am very pleased. At such a wide angle, you will most like need to ""de-fish"" your final shot which can be remedied with CS2 or some other image processing software. At 10-20mm, the range is almost too wide, but after further usage, I got used to it. I'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. The only drawbacks I know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by Sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. It is not a fixed aperture lens. I also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and I wouldn't go beyond that because I started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens. But other than that, I've been pretty satisfied for the price I paid for this ultra wide angle lens. I still would prefer Nikon's 12-24mm, but I'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens. Sigma's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable.";Ultra Wide and Fantastic for Landscape Photography
6;34.0;5.0;8.0;I am a commercial photographer, and for the company I work for, I have a Nikon D610 and a 18-35 3.5-4.5.

I decided I wanted extreme wide angle for my cameras, so I decided to give this lens a try.  I love it!\n\nIt is built like a tank, better than a lot of Nikkor lenses.  It has fast focus, instant manual focus override, and it is sharp.  In fact, it is sharper than the 18-35 Nikkor that is on a FX D610 at 24mp, and I have it on a DX 16mp D7000.\n\nI usually stick with Nikkor lenses, but I decided to give this a try and I love it.;Great on my Nikon D7000s
74;35.0;5.0;21.0;"I didn't plan to buy this and I gave it lots of thought.  I tend to love longer lenses and just prefer to shoot as a fly on the wall.  I've always thought I could just ""zoom out"" with my feet as needed.  Then with a few small shooting locations (usually brides getting ready in small rooms) I thought it could be useful.  WOW, did I fall in love with this lens.  Immediately I found myself archiving walls of photos I have on display - something I couldn't fit in before.  Suddenly a whole room would come to life in the camera - fantastic.\n\nI've always been one to purposely shoot a little wider than I felt I needed to crop later, and now that idea is taken to the next level since I can actually really fit it alllllll in.\n\nIf you're only shooting down to 18mm on your nikon DSLR, this lens will rock your world.\n\nSince I got this lens it has lived on my nikon body, and has made me ponder picking up another nikon body just to be sure I have this at hand at all times.  BTW, my normal lens is the 18-200vr, which is still a great ""walking around"" lens.\n\nBuild quality is great.  Nice to have a focus meter, and the m/a focus is something I've come to expect, and this one works great.  Good pro metal mount that locks on nicely.  About the only gripe I have is that the zoom ring is very close to the body and I find myself occasionally running a finger into the built-in flash overhang from the body.  Not a biggie, however.  I also would have liked a slightly faster f-stop on a lens of this cost, but with higher ISO being rendered much better it is becoming less and less of a wory.";great lens, good glass

24;37.0;1.0;16.0;I had read many of the reviews on Amazon and the Net before buying this lens.  While most of them were good, a small percentage mentioned that they had received lenses that were soft, or highly distorted, etc.  It appeared a small percentage were of poor or faulty construction.  I decided to take my chances, as this was an exceedingly good price for a wide angle lens.\n\nWhen I got it, I put it on my Canon, and took a few test pictures of my wife.  Hmm, there was significant distortion, but that was a fact of life with Wide Angles.  I then took it with me on a trip to Colorado for three weeks for Business.  I took most of my pictures with my new wide angle, trying to get a feel for it.  Given that I am a highly amateur shooter, I did not review them until I had returned home and uploaded them on my desktop.  When I did I was shocked.  Almost all of my pictures were out of focus.  But not completely out of focus.  A small, circular area in the center was sharp.  Everything else around the edges was out of focus.  Horribly so.  The left side worse than the right.  I was landscapes with fairly consistent distances at small F-Stops, so depth of field was not the problem.\n\nAfter examining the pictures, I returned the lens.  I think I will save up for a Canon 10-22 for my next foray into wide angle lenses.\n\nThe service was great, the lens was heavy and felt solid.  My only problem was the faulty optics, which, for a lens, is a pretty big problem!;Great price, ruined by faulty construction
31;38.0;4.0;16.0;"First, this is not my first UWA lens. When it comes to ultra-wides, I've had my share. From the Tokina 11-16/2.8 (sold cause the range was too limited), two copies (one Nikon, one Canon) of the Tokina 12-24/4 and the Tokina 10-17 fisheye, I've tried most of them out there. (Sorry, I'll not spend a dime on a EF-S lens again. Thus, I've never had the cheapo Canon 10-22)\n\nThis is my replacement to the motorless Nikon-mount Tokina 12-24/4 (version 1 - version 2 has an internal focus motor). I was very skeptical of this lens for a number of reasons. Sigma has had troubles lately, I'm not a fan of variable aperture lenses and it's a ""third party"" lens. I've owned lots of them, but I usually end up being happier with Canon or Nikon lenses. As this does replace one of the top-rated (and personal fav of mine) 12-24, it has a lot to live up to. It doesn't disappoint.\n\nHonestly, you're spending about half (or less) than any Nikon branded lens in the range (and right now - that would be one: 10-24). So expecting perfection or even close is certainly a path to unhappiness. I expected to send it back - but I haven't.\n\nPros: 10mm on the short end. Fixable distortion. Reasonable CA. You get good colors and contrast. Fast focus, given the focal length.\nCons: CA, soft at the edges.\n\nReally, for the money and for the way that most of us print, you'll find little, if any, difference between this and any other UWA. Nope, it doesn't have a fixed 2.8 - so if isolating your subject is important - pick the Tokina 11-16. Although I'm not sure that's the focus of this type of lens, anyway.\n\nAnyone who will be really unhappy with this lens will fall into two camps: pixel-peepers and pros. Pros, most likely, won't be shooting DX anyway. Pixel-peepers are seldom, if ever, really happy. Everyone else is going to find what most reviewers say, it's a great lens. Had I not seen the edge-to-edge sharpness of the 11-16 or incredible colors of the 12-24, I probably couldn't find fault with it either.\n\nBuy it, use it, love it.

92;39.0;5.0;18.0;"Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful!\n\nPersonally, I hate zoom lenses. I've got a full set of Nikon primes. And while I'd prefer a prime lens, these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr.\n\nI like this lens because it goes WIDE on digital. I suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives.\n\nFor anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end, unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time, 2mm is a SIGNIFICANT difference in field of view on short lenses. As the focal length increases (eg, from 400mm to 600mm), the difference in angle of view is not very large. But the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though ""only 2mm"" is no laughing matter, and if you don't believe me, you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself.\n\nIf you end up deciding to get a 12mm, you want to buy the sigma 12mm (I think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)!\n\nAlso, if Sigma or Nikon reads this review, please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime!\n\nAnd if Sigma reads this review, I want some f1.2 or f1.0 AFD primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! I would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele!

69;40.0;4.0;17.0;"This is what I originally had written:\n\nI bought this lens after taking the time to compare - and use at home - the Tamron 11-18mm f/4.5-5.6 lens for my Nikon. Very noticable difference between the two. I also compared it with the Tokina 12-24mm.  Again, the Sigma was more compelling to me. It's got a sturdier feel to it and it performs better. Most impressive? The ""HSM"" or ""Hyper-sonic Motor."" It's incredibly fast and quiet. You don't hear the a motor grinding its way into focus as you do with other lenses (you know who you are!).  Absolutely quiet.  And take a peak at the glass.  It's beautiful.  I haven't had a problem with ghosting at all.  And, I've taken some breathtakingly sharp shots with this lens.  Distortion?  Yes, at the extremes.  But, it's almost to be expected from a lens just a step away from being a fisheye lens.  I consider distortion from this lens as a non-issue. I'd gladly take that in exchange for everything else this lens brings to the table. My expectations have gone up after using this lens. In fact, I was impressed enough to purchase another Sigma: the 30mm F1.4 EX DC HSM.  Another great lens!\n\nHere's my update:\n\nThis lens developed focusing issues a while back.  I'd describe the issues as an inability to lock in on an object and stay locked in.  The auto-focus mechanism, which has always been very quiet, quick and accurate, now seems to bounce around from near to far searching for a focus point before actually finding one.  This causes a delay in getting the shot - and the delay can range from a second to entirely preventing the shot from being taken (during that particular attempted shutter actuation). Even when the lens is directed towards a specific object - with sharp lines - it's as if the lens is being used at night and there is nothing to focus on.  Under those circumstances, the internal focus ring will quickly swing back and forth and then, having found nothing, will stop (as if to prompt the use to try another target.  The warranty has expired (not a 5 year warranty like Nikon) so if I want to fix it, I'll have to foot the bill myself.\n\n(I ended up buying the Tokina 16-24mm - very, very nice lens).\n\nI'm even more disturbed by this ""quirk"" because I've got two other Sigma lens which have had their own issues as well!  Am I incredibly unlucky?\n\nI've got a Sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 DG HSM II Macro Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.  Out of nowhere, the auto-focus on the lens completely failed - on my D300 as well as my D90. Couldn't have happened at a worse time for me.  But, fortunately, the lens was still under warranty and I got it fixed.  I haven't had any issues with it since (it's an otherwise very solid piece of equipment - and $1,000 less than the Nikon VR equivalent\n\nNext, I've got a Sigma EX Lens - 30 mm F/1.4 for Nikon DSLRs.  This aperture mechanism on lens has malfunctioned.  If I try to stop the lens all the way down to f22, the pictures end up being blown out - the complete opposite of what one would expect.  There's no function whatsoever for all f-stops between f11 and f22.  Of course, I bought the lens for it's use wide open - and it still works fine at 1.4.  But, the warranty has expired and, again, I'll have to foot the bill if I want it fixed.\n\n(I bought a Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens to replace it.

But by the time your done returning, you'll probably be out of pocket in shippng charges.\n\nSigma lens's are extremely good, i still swear by them. But this one may cost u a lot more than u think.\n\nI anted up and got the canon 10-22 and well, it's now glued to the body :);i love sigma but this lens SUCKSSSSSSS
46;42.0;5.0;15.0;Just got the Sigma 10-20 lens for Nikon and using it on a D80.\nIt is loads of fun to use.\n\nOn the wide end, the extra 2mm difference between 10mm and 12mm maximum width as found on the Nikon or Tokina is truly remarkable.  If you are going to go wide, go as wide as you can and get this lens.\n\nCombined with the zoomed end, it is a very versatile instrument and will likely see more time attached to my camera than the 18-135 kit lens.\n\nContrary to rumors commonly circulating on the internet which made me think twice about getting this lens, upon some use I have found these rumors unfounded and have encountered no problems.  Here are my findings to debuke the rumors you will see around:\n\nThe lens caps are just fine, the front one being identical to a Nikon design and well made, the rear one snugly fitting, (maybe a bit too tight).  Don't waste your money on replacement lens caps as others have claimed to have done until you have seen these.\n\nContrary to many people's worries, the addition of a single 77mm Tiffen clear UV filter as sold by Amazon creates NO vignetting.  According to the lens instructions you should not add a second filter, as THIS may cause vignetting.  Personally I do not stack filters anyway.  Don't believe the vignetting hype, it 'aint there.\n\nContruction is robust and the lens feels like a tank.  The controls operate smoothly, with confidence and precision.  There is no creep.\n\nThe packaging is fine.  The enclosed carrying case is well made to a rectangular shape and has interior padding.  Unlike the sueded bags that come with a Nikon lens, Sigma put a lot of attention into making a protective case worthy of this lens.  Has a belt strap, too, so makes a handy belt case for carrying other items.\n\nThe warranty is a 1 year Sigma international plus 3 additional years Sigma USA warranty.\n\nOverall I am very excited about tbis product and look forward to having fun.  Highly recommended for everyone.;Great lens, period.

Mount the Sigma (or any other ultrawide) on a DSLR, rack it out to 10-11mm, look through the viewfinder and see an entirely new perspective on the world that is totally different from what the human eye sees. Objects that are close to the camera appear much closer, and distant objects appear to be much farther away. You'll also notice that straight lines toward the edges of the frame bend, and this distortion changes dramatically as you point the camera up or down. It's a whole new world of photography, and making effective use of the ultrawide perspective takes some practice and getting used to.\n\nRegarding the Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 specifically, it is arguably the most popular among several ultrawide choices available to Nikon and Canon users for several good reasons -- not the least of which is its low price (I recently purchased one from Amazon for my Nikon D90 for $479.99). Construction quality is excellent, particularly for a third party lens. There's nothing loose or sloppy about it, and it feels solid. I especially like the nonslip exterior finish of the zoom and focus rings, which are large and well-separated. Zooming is a little on the stiff side, but very nicely dampened and smooth without any ""catches"" in the zoom travel.\n\nOptically it's a bit of a compromise, like all ultrawides, but Sigma did a good job of balancing them. Overall sharpness is generally quite good, but it's not absolutely tack-sharp. It's noticeably soft, even in the center, at f/4 (especially zoomed out to 10mm). Stopping down to f/5.6 cures this and improves edge sharpness dramatically. Vignetting is also quite noticeable wide open at 10mm, but stopping down a bit virtually eliminates this problem. Distortion at 10 mm is irregular and difficult to correct in post processing, but simply zooming in to 11mm corrects this problem for architectural shots with a lot of straight lines. Lens flare and chromatic aberration that can be problematic with ultrawides are both extremely well managed -- not a problem at all, in fact.\n\nIn summary, the Sigma 10-20 is a reasonably priced and incredibly useful addition that will open up new photographic horizons for anyone whose current widest angle lens is 17-18mm. For example, it's a perfect complement to the versatile Nikon 18-200 VR lens for anyone who wants to travel light and still have all their bases covered for any photographic eventuality. Other users have accurately described it as a ""fun"" lens. And it even comes packaged with a nice padded case. Nice touch, Sigma.";Prepare to Relearn Photography
29;44.0;5.0;13.0;"First words?  ""Wow.""\n\nSecond words?  ""Why did I wait this long?""\n\nFrom 2004-2008, I owned a Nikon D70.  From 2008 on, I've owned a Nikon D90.  Both DX bodies, both great.  My widest lenses through all of those years was always an 18mm.  That was usually ""wide-enough"" for me, but there were occasions where I couldn't *quite* frame the photo the way I wanted.  Couldn't *quite* fit it all in the frame.  As this lens has been out for a few years, I've toyed on and off with buying one.  I finally recently did, and I'm blown away.\n\nI should have bought this lens 4 years ago.  This lens has opened my eyes to how restrictive 18mm on a DX-body can be.  You don't understand ""wide"" until you've shot with a lens like this.\n\nI'm generally a Nikkor guy.  I love my Nikon bodies, and I generally like to use Nikkor glass.  But I've got to say, this is my second Sigma lens, and both have greatly exceeded my expectations.  The build-quality on this thing is great. Zero regrets.  And for half the price as Nikkor's 10-24mm, it's a good deal.  Optically and mechanically, it seems flawless.  Sharp, contrasty, and not a lot of distortion for as wide as this is.\n\nAnd yes, there's a newer version of this lens, a fixed-aperture f3.5 10-20.  For me it doesn't matter much as I'm mostly using this lens down around 10mm anyway, where the difference between f4 and f3.5 is nearly meaningless.  And it's so wide even at 20mm, that shake issues (due to slow shutter necessitated by f5.6) are mostly a moot point.  IMHO, fixed apertures matter a whole lot more for telephoto lenses than they do for wides, and this lens is super-wide.\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, this lens is astounding.  It's not just about being wide; capturing the whole skyline, the whole meadow, or the whole mountain range. It's really about perspective and depth.  Even a photo of something as mundane as a soda can on a coffee table takes on a whole new perspective (literally!) when shot with a super-wide like this.  Get close.  Really close.  Closer.  Pow!  Your photography will never be the same.  Just as a telephoto lens compresses distance (distant objects seem closer), wide angle really expands distance.  Compose a flower or some other small object up close, with an expansive background landscape, at 10mm, and the resulting photo will nearly leap out at you.  Push it further, closer to the foreground object, and the flower will be enormous while the distant mountain peaks are minuscule.  Amazing creative potential.\n\nThis lens is about as wide as you can go on a DX body.  It's probably not an 'every-day' or 'walkaround' lens for most people.  Myself included.  But I can say that if I could only grab *two* lenses for a day of casual and fun shooting, there's a pretty good chance I'd grab this 10-20 right after either my 35mm or 50mm prime.";A breath of fresh air for DX DSLR owners.
58;45.0;5.0;14.0;"I'm a professional photographer (over 35 years) and I jumped into digital about a year ago with the Nikon D70s. It accepted my extensive collection of Nikon lens, but I purchased the Tamron 28-300 as my standard lens (very happy) but the wide 28mm was not wide enough. I bought the Nikon 15mm 1:5.6 back in the 80's for $1800 and it's a super lens, but the new light weight digital lens spoiled me so I decided to upgrade to the Sigma 10-20... nice range, good price, looked small in the ad, so I bought it.\n\nUnfortunately when it arrived I was a little surprised to find this ""digital only"" lens about as big and heavy as the Nikon...1 lbs vs. 1 1/8 for the Sigma. Both are bulky and heavy, but the quality of the Sigma lens caught me by surprise. Noticeably better than the Tamron, and a better feel than the Nikon... I was a little shocked, but not as shocked as my first sharpness test when the Sigma was way sharper than my Tamron and even a little sharper than my Nikon 15mm.\n\nNikon gave me a super wide with straight lines for a small fortune... Sigma did it with a zoom for under $500--- What's not to love. If your work calls for a super wide, you could hardly do better than this at any price. Highly Recommended.";Heavyweight but worth it.
85;46.0;5.0;14.0;Not only is this beauty wide, I have found the lens is very sharp to on my D200! It is built solid and focus's fast, and I don't have any problem with distortion because I use DXO Optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! Buy this lens, it is cheap for what you get.;Wow this sucker is wide!
87;47.0;5.0;13.0;"This lens is great - very sharp and WELL worth the money.  Especially since the Nikon version is TWICE as much - and this lens is WIDER (10mm vs. Nikon's 12mm)... Some have complained of ""distortion"" at 10mm, true, there is some, but that's what I LIKE about it.  What fun is WIDE ANGLE if no one can TELL it's wide angle? If you are on the fence, BUY IT.  You won't regret it!";Amazing Lens
62;48.0;4.0;12.0;"My first impression when I received a package with this lens was ""Wow!"".\nThis lens is very well built and it comes with a dedicated case.\nThere was an extended warranty from Sigma included with the lens in addition to the standard one. If I remember well, it was 4 or 5 years in total. Very good, Sigma!\nThe Sigma 10-20 mm f/4-5.6 EX lens for Pentax mount looks different from the picture on Amazon. It does not have the window for scale, instead the last one is just painted on the barrel. And certainly it is not HSM, but a ""screwdriver"" type.\nIt mounts and locks on my *istDs and K10D easily. Surprisingly, I still can rotate the lens in the mount (in locked position) to a small but noticeable degree. It seems that the lock mechanism on this lens has ""extended"" tolerance and/or the mount coupling lens-body is not tight enough. This is a bit annoying. The zoom barrel is stiff in operation, so it happens to me to push it a bit harder and so turn the lens in the mount.\nNow a few words about the optical quality of this lens.\nI read many reports stating that their copy of the lens was good, as well as the ones stating the opposite.\nAlthough my copy of this lens is not as sharp as my prime lenses (which was expected), it is good. But there is one ""BUT"".\nMy lens is sharp provided it is focused correctly. This is something difficult to achieve in certain situations and especially at wider angles. With this lens the AF tends to lock elsewhere, but not on the subject. And often there is no consistency - even if I focus several times on the same subject which is 3 meters away, the AF may lock anywhere from 1 m to infinity.\nI am not sure if this is the lens or the camera AF system which causes such behaviour. In most cases I just set the distance manually and rely on the DOF.";Very good lens. If you can focus it correctly.
64;49.0;5.0;12.0;July 29th Update:  Bought another as a gift for a friend.  That should tell you it's a great lens.  That makes 3 copies of this lens I bought and all 3 are flawless. Best Buy for the $$$.\n\n-----------------\n\nMarch 3, 2008 UPDATE:  Still find zero faults with this lens and now keep it on the Rebel XTI all the time.  I really love the 10mm extra wide setting.  Still a ***** review.  I have not found that the f-stop difference between the Sigma and Canon lens (f/4-5.6 vs. f/3.5-4.5) has had any real effect. Hey, my D-40 goes to ISO 3200 if necessary.  Not a preferred ISO, but what I'm saying is that except in a few cases, the difference is of little consequence. Technically, that's a down side. The reality is that most folks will use this lens outdoors.\n\nI have a number of Canon 'L' series lenses.  They are the best.  But, unless you are shooting for NASA, this Sigma lens stacks up with the 'L' series for optical quality for most folks.\n\nThere is a difference.  The difference is $684.70 vs. $487.60 and it's a big difference. (Both prices via Amazon 3/3/2008)  This lens still screams BUY ME!\n\nOriginal Review:\nI'm not a pro but have been taking pix for 40 years.  I know what I like and know quality when I have my hands on it.  An ultra-wide is not a lens that folks normally use a lot.  But, when you need one there's nothing like 10-20mm.  It was a tossup between the Sigma 10-20mm and the Canon 10-22mm lens. I chose the Sigma because of the price and some other great reviews.\n\nQuality of the Sigma, in many unbiased test reviews, shows little, if any, differences from the higher priced canon.  On both my XTI and 40d the lens does a great job.  My recommendation?  Buy it. Since I've had mine I was convinced to buy another Sigma lens.  The pictures are very sharp. The color and contrast is great and I've probably shot 300 pix with it so far.;A specility Lens That Screams 'Buy-Me'
14;50.0;2.0;9.0;I looked carefully at the reviews (Amazon and others) before purchasing this lens.  Most of the reviews were favorable but about 15-20% mentioned the issues with a lack of sharpness.  I decided to take a chance.  I got my first copy and was very pleased with the build quality, but I was disappointed with the lens quality after shooting my first set of pictures... As others reviewers have reported - sharp in the middle and soft to blurry moving out to the edges (even at higher f/stops).  Contacted Amazon and returned the lens.  They sent a replacement next day shipping (Kudos to Amazon!).  Now I had two copies to compare.  Using a brick wall I compared shots at various f/stops using both Sigma lenes and my 17-55 kit lens.  The second lens was as bad as the first and my kit lens outperformed them both at all f/stops.  I just finished packing up the second lens to send back for a refund.  I find it hard to believe that I got 2 bad copies, but the serial numbers were only one number different so maybe it was a bad batch.  I guess I'm going to drop the extra money and get the Canon lens.;Hoping for a good copy
50;51.0;5.0;11.0;I've owned many lenes of all different brands but most of which have been Canon L series. This was my first time to own and use a lens from Sigma. The Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM copy that I bought here on amazon is as close to an L series lens as I have ever used. I reserched many lenses from Canon, Sigma, Tamron, etc. and I was concerned that because the Sigma lens is not a Canon brand that it might have communication issues with my Canon 20D body as some of the other non-Canon brand lenes I've used. So just as soon as I got it I put it to the test. I am thrilled to say that it passed with flying colors. This lens focuses nearly as fast as my Canon 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM and is tack on and very sharp. The focus ring and the zoom ring are both very smooth. The velvety coating on the lens barrel feels very nice. Other reviews I've seen complain about the noise from the Sigma lens. I hardly noticed any even shooting in an empty house. The noise during focusing is a little more noticable that my Canon lenses but certainly not a deal breaker if trying to decide on wich brand of lens to purchase. I use this lens mainly shooting real estate interior shots and so using it at it's widest angle is where it spends most of it's time. So in these situations there is three main things I needed from this lens:\n - Sharpness - I've already said it, It's sharp!\n - Controlled C/A - Very little to none I am very impressed and happy here!\n - Controlled Barrel Distortion - This is a little more pronounced that the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM that I was renting but again not a deal breaker in my opinion and I feel it is still very well controlled.\n\nI love my Canon lenes but for anyone looking to save a few hundred bucks on a ultra wide angle lens, you will not be disappointed by going with the Sigma 10-22mm EX DC HSM.;The best non-Canon lens I've ever used!
28;52.0;5.0;9.0;"I read a ton of reviews before purchasing...just like I bet you are. Canon 10-22mm or Sigma 10-20mm seemed like my only real choices, here is why. I have a canon XSi and a 7D. I have a 24-70mmL and a 70-200mm 2.8L ...so I needed a crop sensor wide angle lens. I plan on a 5D but later. I buy lenses to accommodate a full frame in the future. The lens I needed for wide angle shots in crop sensor is a vastly different animal than a full frame WA lens. This purchase was just for the 7D and XSi. So I rented both lenses and tried them out. As you can see, I'm a canon guy. Never buy anything but, but this time the Sigma won out by great image quality (color and sharpness) and cost. The price difference was a factor in my investment, I figured that eventually I'll get the 16-35mm L when the FF comes and sell this. After using it for the last 6 months...I won't be selling it. My copy works beautifully; I rarely use anything but 10mm and 20mm... almost never caught in between. It is a wide angel zoom so you pay a tiny price in overall image quaility outside the sweet spots, true for any of the available zoom lenses. Even my beloved ""L""'s. I do like the versatility of this lens, it is really it's strong point...at 10mm you can compose a shot to take advantage of a touch of fish eye/barrel distortion or go to 20mm for an equivalent 35mm view, nice crisp shots. Outside its great, indoors it's a bit slow but nothing you can't work with. It captures phenomenal landscape shots, really, phenomenal. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this purchase; it's easy on the pocket and rocks for wide angel views.";This lens ROCKS !!!
91;53.0;5.0;11.0;This is the best lens I own, also my favorite. It's built like a tank, has super quiet (and fast) HSM focusing, sharp as a tack, and several hundred dollars cheaper than the Canon 10-22mm.\n\nI have a Canon 30D and this lens was the best purchase I made for it. Composing shots can be tricky with such a wide field of view (you need to get really close in order to get an object in your foreground). The 10mm has some noticeable distortion, although it's fine for landscapes -- in fact, I think the distortion makes clouds look phenomenal.\n\nI wish it were f/4 throughout the zoom range (f/2.8 would be even better). This lens has an EF mount, so it will work on other Canon film and full-frame bodies (with some heavy vignetting).\n\nAll in all, a great value. I'm very happy with my copy (pay no attention to the pixel peepers).;Excellent Ultra Wide (and Canon Substitute)
51;54.0;1.0;10.0;"I returned the lens today. Tried it extensively on a Rebel XSi. Maybe I had one of the bad copies. The sharpness was barely acceptable in the center. The corner sharpness was terrible. The images from the ""cheap"" 18-55 IS kit lens included with the XSi blow the ones taken with the Sigma flat out of the water. I will not take the chance and get another. Too much hassle and frustration. In my opinion it is not acceptable for a company like Sigma to have such sloppy quality control.";returned
94;55.0;5.0;11.0;I have been using the lens with my Nikon D70 for over a year, and I am very happy with it. I use the lens for most of my day to day shooting.\n\n(+) 10mm focal length - Yee haa! One year after, and I still can't get the smirk off my face. Even with the accompanied pincushion distorsion (see below) the 10mm focal length is simply a joy (Nikon's zoom only goes as wide as 12mm, 12 is noticable narrower than 10).\n\n(+) Optical quality - is very good as far as I can judge. There is a pretty noticeable pincushion distorion at the 10mm end, but I understand all ultra-wide zooms suffer from the same phenomena. The distorsion at 12mm focal length is far less noticable.\n\n(+) Build quality - no complaints. except for this lens I also own Sigma's 30mm f/1.4 lens (which has disappointing optical performance IMO). 30mm's optical issues aside, - both feel solid and stable, no loose rings or levers or anything like that. Sigma does an excellent job here.\n\n(+) HSM focusing works very well, my guess is that Nikon would be as good or perhaps slightly better. One of the other non-Nikon alternative uses the screwdriver blade type auto focus rather than ultrasonic motor (the built it ultrasonic AF is way nicer to use).\n\nAll the negatives or 'cons' if you will, are right there in the data sheet, no unpleasent surprises whatsoever. The lens is big and heavy but so is the competition (Nikon). I wish it could go a little further to say 22mm or 25mm, but again - I knew it won't, before I bought it. As a Nikon owner I don't really think there a significantly better choice, if you own a Canon DSLR body though, then the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM lens may be a better choice.\n\n5 start with no hesitation, no other DSLR lens I know gives so much value for the money! (except, perhaps, for that 10-22 canon lens, which is the forbidden fruit for us Nikonians).;Awesome lens.
35;56.0;5.0;9.0;First off, a wide-angle is sensor specific so there are just a few top contenders for Canon's APC-S (1.6x crop factor) cameras. I shoot with the Canon EOS 40D. The downside here is that if you choose to get a full-frame camera body such as the Canon EOS 5D, you will need to replace this and any other EF-S lenses you own.\n\nThe Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 has everything I valued going for it: price, build quality, great glass and zoom range. It also comes with a lens hood which the more expensive Canon competitor does not.\n\nI rented a couple of comparable lenses to help in my decision: the Tokina 11-16mmf/2.8 and the Canon 10-22m f/3.5-5.6\n\nThe Canon 10-22mm, like all EF-S lenses I've used, is built like a toy in comparison to other lenses. Cheap, plastic, loose tolerances. While it did produce OK results, I got vignetting wide open. Considering that its' price is higher than all the rest, it did not look like a good value.\n\nThe Tokina, on the other hand, was build like a tank. Great contrast, clarity and fast. However, I decided that I didn't need the f/2.8 or the extra $100 on the price tag and did want the extra zoom range. But it is a great lens and you can read my review on the product page.\n\nRegardless, I am completely satisfied with this lens and highly recommend it over the Canon.;Fanstastic lens and a great value
78;57.0;4.0;10.0;This lens has an impressive wide angle capability.  I recently took some pictures of a showroom and got ooh's and aah's from my colleagues.  I'm very happy with its performance so far in that regard, although I had to take away .5 stars for an occasional lack of crisp focus.  Even with high f-stops, low ISO, and a tripod, it was difficult to get sharpness across all the areas of the shot, in every shot.  To be fair I have more experimentation to do before the full verdict is in.  I'm also biased from working with some nice prime lenses that are very sharp.\n\nThe build quality and feel is superb.  It is solid and has that feel-good heaviness to it that sums up quality components.  The price for the value also gives it a leg up on its more expensive substitutes... which aren't perfect either.;Great wide angle, solid feel
22;58.0;3.0;8.0;I had high hopes of a good sigma copy but ordered the canon 10-22mm at the same time to compare.  I swapped out the lenses taking pictures at the same scenes and noticed some significant basic differences in photo quality just looking at the photos side by side.  That was all I needed to fall in love with the canon.  Maybe I could have exchanged the sigma until I found a copy I liked, but I am too busy with the canon.;I fell in love with the Canon 10-22mm
12;59.0;4.0;6.0;"I owned multiple copies of this lens, having switched between Nikon and Canon bodies.  My take on the pros and con are as follows:\n\nPros:\n+ Price/value - the least expensive autofocusing ultra-wide angle (UWA) lens for crop sensor.  If you have a good copy it's competitive with the Nikon 10-24 or Canon 10-22.\n+ Sharp if you have a good copy - the center is sharp wide open and the corners catch up around f/8 to f/11\n+ Good colors/contrast - I found pictures from the 10-20mm to have better contrast and more saturated colors straight out of camera than the Tamron 17-50mm, a lens that pairs well with this lens at around the same price.\n+ Solid build quality - no wobbly parts, tightly constructed, and internal focusing (no extending/retracting parts when focusing).  The zoom and focus rings both have a solid feel to them.\n+ Fast and almost silent autofocus\n+ Comes with a 5-year warranty, padded case and hood (Canon only provides 1 year and no accessories for their non-L lenses)\n+ Takes 77mm filters - no vignetting even with non-slim frame filters\n\nCon:\n- I've mentioned ""if you have a good copy"" several times.  I've tested 5 copies of this total and 3 of them showed some degree of de-centered elements, two obvious.  If a glass lens element or group of elements is not aligned or slightly tilted inside the lens, the effect can show up in pictures.  The effect is that one side (left, right, top or bottom) will be blurry and out of focus while the other side will be sharp and in focus.  To be fair, this isn't a problem limited to this lens - there are copies of the $2000 Nikon 14-24mm or the $1700 Canon 16-35mm that have this problem.  The problem does seem more pronounced in UWA lenses, probably due to the large angle of view.  How do I test for decentering?  Shoot a flat subject (a brick wall, a row of trees or even a grass lawn) but make sure the lens is facing completely perpendicular to the subject.  Shooting at a non-90 degree angle will naturally cause one side to be more out-of-focus, especially at wide apertures.  If the lens is decentered, it will be most apparent at its widest length and aperture (in this case, 10mm f/4) because the most glass is exposed to the sensor.  View the image at 100% on the computer at the sides of the image.  Usually most lenses have one side slightly sharper than the other, but if one side is obviously blurrier than the other then it can be a problem in your real-world shots.  It's a shame that quality control and manufacturing tolerances have not caught up to eliminate this problem and I've heard that it can be quite time-consuming to fix a decentered lens.\n\nIn short, I recommend this lens for its pros but advise you thoroughly test it out when you get it.";Best value UWA, provided you get a good copy
70;60.0;5.0;9.0;"This lens is the best quality lens for the price available.  What I mean is, out of any cheaper wide angle lenses out there, it would be best to spend the few more dollars for this lens.  It comes with a carrying case and hood which is extra nice; considering Canon is charging hundreds more and for whatever reason cannot bring themselves to giving anything away for free.  Speaking of Canon, I'm a Canon guy all the way, and this is the first time I considered straying from Canon Products.  I'm really glad I did.  The reviews on the Canon lens are too iffy to justify paying 200-400 more for roughly the same lens. The photo examples don't give me any justification to pay that kind of extra money either. Some reviews on this lens also seem to be a bit negative, but unless your shooting with the big boys, theres no outstanding reason to upgrade to a more expensive wide angle, as this will cover all of your needs with great clarity and color.  The only real fault that is noticeable with this lens is that amount of distortion at the edges at 10mm.  This is to be expected with such a wide lens, and can simply be solved by shooting closer to 12mm..etc.  However, in some cases, the 10mm distortion actually works in your favor to enhance the height of trees, buildings, and that sort of thing.  (Examples of this exist in the photos regarding this lens).\n\nCertainly consider reading others reviews, and go to Canon's lens reviews as well, so you can make your own decisions.  I just hope this helps in deciding if its worth spending the extra cash for Canon.  Happy hunting!";great lens, great price
17;61.0;4.0;7.0;"I would give this lens a 4 star rating, which in my book is about as good as you get unless the lens is truly outstanding and top of the heap. Since there are clearly far more expensive lenses out there with finer workmanship in the body of the lens and the glass, this is pretty darn good.\n\nHaving said that, I have to say that I have run tests on the lens in real world situations where some features fall short.\n\nSharpness. I am still using my trusty Rebel XTi Kiss 10.10-megapixel which will only carry so much sharpness from any lens due to resolution of the CMOS. The Sigma 10-20 provides equal sharpness from the center to the outsides of its coverage as my Canon 17-40 mm zoom at the same focal lengths.\n\nAuto focus. This is where the Sigma can fall short. Based on a Chart test of lines on a flat field at 45 degrees to the camera, the auto focus consistently focuses considerably in front of the focus line regardless of the foual length and choice of camera driven auto focusing method. Having said that, it is seldom in real life that I ever shoot a piece of paper with lines drawn on it. On standard product shots on a white seamless with an object standing up, the focus was accurate both wide open and fully closed down at 10mm to 20mm. But here again, I am not very often going to be using this lens for table top product photography. I tried it shooting the action of kids running around with Alpacas for a client and it took wonderful images, but in this case it often focused too far back, thus throwing important information in the foreground out of focus. I may have to test this using one of the different focusing method internally on the camera. I am used to the massive depth of field of fixed length wide angles, and never had to worry of depth of field when shooting in strong sunlight even with action but these lenses have been designed with the help of computers to achieve such minimum of distortion at different focal lengths that I expect some of the old rules of thumb to no longer apply.\n\nDepth of field. Since I will be shooting flooring installations with this lens, one of my main concerns is depth of field on location. So I did do tests on a 4'x8' table top at about a 45 degree angle of downward view. I stretched out builder's rules both from the front bottom to the end of the table and across at bottom right to top left corner of the viewfinder view. I also had an imitation wall standing up at the ends for vertical testing. I shot versions from wide open (something I would never do) to fully closed down (in this case f22). The results were as expected in that the maximum depth of field was certainly at f22 but also the sharpest detail was also at f22. That I did not expect since up until now, I have always expected the middle f-stop to provide the sharpest overall resolution. Frankly, I have enormous respect for the engineers who bend light with the multiple elements to achieve these wide angle zoom views from 10-20mm with so little barrel distortion. Photoshop then can fix what's left.\n\nLens flare. This is always a problem with lenses as the focal length shrinks. I don't find any more of a problem with this lens as with any other super wide lenses. Just don't shoot into the sun! But what's new about that?\n\nEase of use. It would be nice if lens manufacturers all made the outer ring the zoom and the inner the focus or vice versa. I have a feeling that there are some engineering reasons for not doing so. But then this has always been true since I first started photography in 1969. I have always had to fold in the task of working enough with all my lenses to make my fingers habituated to where their controls are without conscious thought. Same is true with cameras that keep changing where you control them. Of course I have the same grip with makers of TV remotes, recorders, auto windshield wiper controls, AC controls and music systems of all kinds.\n\nStructural. I have not had this lens long enough nor used it enough (only a couple of weeks) to have a track record yet. But it is solid, nothing sloppy about the controls, clicks into place on my Canon body firmly with no additional movement and is just as easy to heft around in changing out lenses as my Canon lenses are. Some have criticized it for its weight. But I like its weight. It adds stability to the camera. You have a light weight camera and you tend to get more camera movement when you squeeze the shutter. Squeeze right? I hope no one is pushing the shutter button.\n\nContrast, exposure, saturation and color. With my Sigma, all these are well within the good and satisfactory standards. I don't find color shifts, flat or contrasty images nor ones that lack color depth. What I have found is some bleariness out on the outer corners in some scenic shots when shot at 10mm. But then I find that as well on my 17-40mm Canon. It is just a bit more exaggerated at 10mm. So unless I am stuck and have no choice but to use the lens at 10mm, I will tend to keep it between 12-20mm. Since I am a commercial photographer and seldom need to make a super-wide visual design statement, this is a lens I will probably use sparingly but will become a vital tool in my bag especially for architectural and real-estate photography.\n\nNice case that will attach to the belt with good padding comes with it.\n\nSo overall, I give this lens top marks for its class. Many lenses at higher cost are not as good. I have yet to test it in the field in architectural photography not have I seen 16""x20"" prints, so I cannot comment on it merits in this application.\n\nI hope this helps those of you who, like me, were wondering if I should give the lens a try. I have read, as I am sure you have too, in the posts above this one, that some people have experienced some bad product. But I do hope they have all actually done some rigorous comparison testing. I would recommend this to everyone when you get any lens for the first time. This lens like many of the super wide lenses is like a grand prix racing car in comparison to a family mini-van. You have to exert a lot of control since they can get away from you easily and you can't expect automated camera controls to do everything you need. But that is more about the photographer using the equipment than the equipment itself. If you receive a good version of the lens, while it has a few flaws, it is easy enough to work around them. But this is true with most lenses. Nothing is perfect. You may have to go manual and/or experiment with some of the camera controls you may not have used before.\n\nPeter";Excellent lens for the price.
11;62.0;4.0;5.0;Image Quality: 3.5/5\nIt is good enough for an ultra wide angle lens, but if you're a pixel peeper, you're eyes will hurt, especially at the edges, where sharpness is nonexistent, distortion is magnified, and chromatic aberration is frequent.\n\nBuild Quality: 3.8/5\nDecent build. Nothing fantastic about it, but it does feel fairly solid. It's mostly plastic, but it doesn't feel like cheap plastic. It is an external zoom, so there's a good chance it'll siphon in some dirt here or there. But it's unlikely that you'll shoot this often enough to have dirt accumulate.\n\nFeatures: 3.8/5\nIt's got a very smooth zoom and focus rotation. Feels like butter almost, so that's a plus. Has full time manual. Has an AF/MF switch, but that's pretty common these days. Autofocus is good enough (not fast, not slow, accurate enough). HSM is quiet, and I never notice any focusing sounds (doesn't mean that they don't exist - it's just not loud enough to bother me). It does lack OS (optical stabilization), but is that something a wide angle lens really needs? Also, it'd be nice if there were a zoom ring lock. I feel like a lot of people use this lens mostly for its 10mm focal length, but the zoom ring is so smooth that it slips out of place ALL THE TIME. You'll have to get used to checking the ring every time you shoot. That's about all there is to the features.\n\nPrice: 4.5/5\nAs for what you get for what you pay, this lens is awesome. You'll find very few lenses out there cheaper than this while offering more. As for the Sigma 10-20mm f/3.5, consider if you really want to pay $150 more for a 3.5. For the most part, I use this to shoot landscapes, which usually requires a fairly narrow aperture (like f/9 or f/16). Also for the most part (99.5% of the time), I use only the 10mm focal length, where you can have the minimum aperture at f/4. So 1/3 of a stop really worth $150? (The answer is no.)\n\nPracticality: 3.8/5\nI have a hard time using this lens more than 15% of the time. My other two lenses include the Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 and the Canon 70-200mm f/4. Both lenses are noticeably sharp, even without pixel peeping. Both lenses offer me a variety of focal lengths. Still, I suppose it really depends on the photographer. If you like a wider angle, you may enjoy this lens a lot more than I do (and I still do enjoy this lens).\n\nOverall: 3.9/5\nGood lens overall. It'd be nice if the lens was sharper overall. Even if corner sharpness can't be corrected, it'd be nice if the center were sharper. A lot of it really does look like rubbish at 100% crop. I'm also not a big fan of the external zoom, but for this price, I'll take it.;Good wide angle lens for crop sensors
68;63.0;5.0;8.0;"I purchased this lens for my Nikon D40 in order to take pictures in small indoor rooms.  It works perfectly for this purpose.  The pictures are sharp with no ""fisheye"" distortion.  One limitation I noticed is that if your pictures require the use of a flash, you will not be able to use the built-in flash on the Nikon D40 because a shadow will appear in the lower middle of your pictures.  One of Nikon's Speedlight flashes should be able to eliminate this problem.";Great for indoor pictures!
71;64.0;5.0;8.0;"Excellent build quality. Lens has a very ""heavy"" feel to it and performs excellent. The included lens hood also works well.\n\nI am very impressed with the quality of the images and the close up photography in macro mode is also excellent.";Excellent product Quality

I research lenses all the time and though the majority of my glass in Nikon; I have Tokina, Tamron, Sigma,a couple of older Vivitar classics and a few very esoteric pieces. This one is a keeper.";16 (x) 20 inch prints are no problem
82;66.0;5.0;8.0;SIGMA doesn't seem to be a third-party lens company any longer. I do like this super-wide angle lens. Considering its price, the sharpness as well as color are awesome. Also, it is very quiet by hypersonic motor. In comparison of TOKINA 12-24, it has 2mm more but 2mm is quite big in the crop body (Nikon x1.5). If I have to mention its drawbacks, I would say that this lens is applied only to the digital SLR camera and its aperture is f/4-5.6.;Awesome super-wide angle lens
34;67.0;5.0;7.0;I was happy with the quality of the lens, but debated quite a while between this one and the Canon 10-22mm. So I bought both and tested them on my Canon Rebel xti. I decided to return the Sigma, as I found the Canon to be just a touch sharper. I found the quality difference to be minor and sometimes nonexistent, so the price difference is probably not justified, but I wanted to be sure, so I went for the Canon. [...];Sigma vs. Canon
36;68.0;5.0;7.0;seems like the first lens we buy after purchasing a camera is the telephoto zoom lens so we can get closer to our subjects......in the words of another photographer, the best zoom lens we have are our legs.....and with this excellent lens, you can walk right up to your subject and take a crisp clear shot and still have all the interesting background in focus also....great for indoor, architecture, and group shots......\n\ni recently shot a church dinner with those round tables that seat 8-10.....i was able to hold the camera over my head and with a bounce flash, take an in focus photo of everyone at the table standing only 4-5 away.....\n\nthe quality is good through out the whole range and it is a very well built quality lens......i have a few friends who own one also and we use this lens all the time.....you'll find yourself grabbing this lens more and more as time goes on......;an awesome addition.....
38;69.0;2.0;7.0;This lens receives very good reviews. I also saw some impressive pictures taken with this lens.\nHowever, I heard many bad things about the Sigma lenses, especially for Sony. Many stories about lens falling apart. Many more story about focus problems (back/front focus). Therefore I tried to avoid Sigma lens, and this is the first time I give Sigma a chance, mainly because there is no proper alternative.\n\nI order the first one here on Amazon from 47th Street Photo. The first picture I took with it left no room for questions - it is a bad copy. I used focus test chart to find enormous front focus. Since I had problems to get reply from 47th Street Photo (I had to file a claim against them before they first reply, but this is a different story) I returned the lens (still waiting for the refund, 3 weeks after the initial contact I made with 47th Street Photo).\n\nI decided to give it another chance, so I made a new order (this time from Amazon). It arrived today, and guess what - front focus! Less severe than the first copy, but still not acceptable. I am returning this lens as well.\n\nI read somewhere that Sigma realize that it is cheaper to deal with the returns and the repair of defective lens than hiring someone to check every lens before shipping. Maybe it is true, but for the long run I believe it is more expensive. I will not buy Sigma again. Maybe I am strange, but I like to get my lens in working condition when I buy a new lens.;No Quality Control - I got 2 bad copies out of 2 tries!
42;70.0;1.0;7.0;You get what you pay for. Got this as a Christmas gift for my wife who used it for the first time yesterday for our daughter's 13th birthday.  It was discovered that a shadow was present in all the pictures taken with this lens, starting from bottom center as if the hood cover was getting in the way, yet the shadow was there with or without the hood... then we noticed the dark picture when the lens was at full 10mm.  I knew there was a hit and miss with this lens before I bought it, but now I wish I would of spent the extra $200.00 for a Canon.;Sigma Disappointed Me Again
43;71.0;5.0;7.0;This without a sliver of doubt is the best lens I've ever purchased. Now keep in mind I would consider myslef a well-funded hobbyist. I am not a professional photographer. This lens is my second most expensive lens I've purchased next to my Tamaron 28-200 aspherical. But the quality this lens gives put it in a class well above it's price point.\n\nThis lens collects the best qulity of light I have ever seen. It is a fast lens and generally allows a 1-2 f-stop improvement in exposure than most. One of the most stunning things about this lens is it's crisp focus. From corner to corner and accross the center - dead on focus. I have noticed nothing in the way of uneven distortion at the widest settings. Also, I have not seen any vignetting, though I'm sure the sun shade would show up in the 10-14mm range.\n\nThis lens also feels good. Like good metal wrapped in hard rubber. It could be wrapped in horse lips for all I know, but it's got the right balance and heft I need. It seems to have a magneto focus drive and there is no noise in focusing and no grinding of gears if you manually adjust.\n\nThe only draw back to the lens is you cannot effectively use the integrated nikon flash (the pop up). The diameter of the lens is considerable and you will see the arc of the lens cast a shaddow on the lower center of most shots.\n\nIf you're looking to buy a wide angle for your Nikon DXXX, buy this lens. You'll find it's one of the best in the bag.;A Value Wide Angle with True Pro Quality
47;72.0;5.0;7.0;"This is the lens that spends about 90 percent of the time on my 20D (I have six lenses!).  In fact, I forgot I even owned the Sigma 10-20 until I looked.  The lens has very good build quality and the zoom touch is superb.  I never really even look at the lens or realize that it's there!\n\nImages are very good, always good colors, tones and good sharpness and saturation.  The wide angle offers a little distortion but that is to be expected on 10mm!\n\nThe zoom range is somewhat limited but you get used to it.  Most of my shots are at either 10mm or 20mm.  Zooming is so easy I can't recall even using the zoom, however when I look at my photos they have been taken at different focal lengths.\n\nTo me, the purpose of a great camera and a great lens is that they work so well they ""get out of the way"" of the creative process.  This zoom truly ""gets out of the way"", your so close to the action that you can take small group shots standing about six feet from your subjects.  This lens really excels at close in people shots, specially in tight situations.\n\nYou can also interact with your subjects, because your not standing 20 feet back asking people to look at the canary standing on your shoulder.  You can have a normal conversation at a normal distance from your subjects then  raise your camera and get a half upper body shot - not too shabby.\n\nIf you take photos of people or working at events where you need lots of shots of people, individually or in small groups, this lens excels.  Dare I say it could be an excellent ""walk around"" lens?";Fantastic wide angle lens
49;73.0;5.0;7.0;I've had this lens for ~8 months now and couldn't be happier. Wide open this lens is a bit soft, but when stopped down to f/5.6 (f/8 is best) the beauty of this lens really starts to show. As far as extreme wide angles go this is the best bargain out there - anything better will run you $1400+ and need a full frame body to take advantage of it. I'm perfectly happy with my A100 and $450 10-20mm - this lens is small, relatively light, and focuses quickly (probably even faster for A700 users).\n\nCombined with sony's super steady shot I feel comfortable handholding this lens full wide at shutter speeds as low as 1/5 so even though it's slow the wide focal length and sony's in-body IS make this lens great even in low light. Also when using sony's relatively new HVL-42AM flash (for fill) I've found this lens takes amazing outdoor portrait shots - perfect for isolating your subject when at a distance in dramatic nature scenes or emphasizing their presence in close up shots. All-in-all I can't recommend this lens enough - it's taken many of my favorite photos and it definitely doesn't hurt that it's a blast to use.;Unassuming lens wows when stopped down
55;74.0;4.0;7.0;"I bought this instead of the Canon 10-22, and never looked back.  Reviews seemed to indicate they were fairly comparable, with no clear ""winner"" in Amazon user reviews or in the trades, but I was on a strict budget and had 2 lenses to buy: this was the one that went cheap.\n\nIn use it is very good.  When wide open at the 10mm end there's vignetting and some chromatic aberration is visible (the dreaded ""purple fringe"" variety) at wide apertures.  Start tightening up the view, though, and it gets much better pretty quick, say by about 12mm@f/8.\n\nAt the 20MM end it is sharp, clean, and lovely.  I've done portraits with it - pretty pleased with the outcomes.\n\nBut what I bought it for was that big, nasty 10mm wide angle barrel distortion thing, and shooting hand held outdoors in low light or straight into the sunset at 10mm with the aperture at f/22 or so it is just great.\n\nI only saved a few hundred bucks, but no buyer's remorse here.  None of the complaints about short focusing soft spots or bad workmanship for me.\n\nHighly recommended.";Overall, a great value.
66;75.0;4.0;7.0;"Pros: Extremely wide angle, you'll wonder how you got along without it.\nAlso, it comes with a sleek case, if thats something that matters to you.\nCheap for a wide angle.\n\nCons: A Crapload of distortion, especially at(but not exclusive to)10mm.\nCheap for a wide angle. (No, this isn't a typo :P)\n\nHaving said that, once you get past the wild distortion at the wide end, this is a truely unique lens, that fulfills a very useful purpose on the Nikon dlsr.\n\nOnce you shoot the world at 10mm (15mm film terms), rarely will you want to go back, believe me, this is one incredible lens, once you're past its shortcomings of distortion.  Being the widest angle zoom for a nikon Dslr, Im sure you will not be disappointed, especially not for the price.\n\nThis is a tremendously useful lens offering from sigma.  It competes well with the other wide angle lenses you can currently buy for a Nikon digital body, with one exception; the distortion, if you have any qualms with wide angle distortion, or have a habit of fixing distortion in photoshop, this will probably be one of the worst lens choices you can make, but, with all things considered, Im glad I bought this lens, because the pictures Ive captured with it, are not possible on any digital equipment, save for the D3.";Great Ultrawide Lens.
73;76.0;4.0;7.0;The build quality of this lens is excellent. This is to be expected with a Sigma lens with the EX designation and this is no exception. The motor is fast and very quiet as it is with my Sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens. Color rendition is good and very saturated. With no issues seen when viewing at 100% on my monitor. Depth of field and close focusing also work as advertised.\n\nThe only complaint I have which is not really a complaint is that the lens is almost too wide. At 100mm it has an almost fisheye effect and everything is in the frame. As an experiment I tried taking a picture of a large cluster of Asiatic lilies in my garden. At 10mm and the closest focusing distance this included the whole cluster of flowers and pretty much everything else in the yard. I can see definate applications in a more wide open landscape, but it will take a lot of practice to limit the somewhat unnatural distortions this can cause.\n\nAll in all I am very pleased with this this lens.;Excellent Quality, But Seemingly Limited Application
75;77.0;5.0;7.0;I had been shopping around for awhile looking for a super wide angle lens but not wanting to pay double for what I paid for my camera.  I have a Nikon D40 and this lens works great.  I heard all the horror stories about it, but I have had no problems.  If you want to dig real deep into something I guess you will find faults.  If you are looking for a super wide lens then buy this Sigma and stop listening to all the nitpickers.  Also the built in flash of the D40 will leave a shadow at the bottom of the picture due to the lens wideness.  I am going to be buying the Nikon SB40 flash unit, that will solve the problem plus I will be able to take better flash shots.;Great Super Wide Lens For The Money
13;78.0;5.0;5.0;This lens is well worth the cost and creates amazingly wide photos with manageable distortion.  Please note that this lens is for Nikon DX & FX cameras but is somewhat crippled on an FX camera such as the D3 or D700 because the bigger sensor on FX cameras is so big that it picks up the barrel of you lens at 10-15mm thus effectively wiping out this range.\n\nIf you have an FX camera, don't waste you money on this but for a DX camera, it's really a must have.  In my opinion, Sigma could charge much more for this lens given the unique range.\n\nThe wide range creates stunning landscapes that just cannot be done with a standard lens.  Just google Sigma 10-20mm on flickr and check out some of the shots.  If that doesn't convince you, this lens is not for you.\n\nBuild quality is very nice.  I've heard that because of the wide range, Sigma's have mixed quality in this focal range.  Mine has been perfect and I recommend it every chance I get.  The lens also holds it's value well which speaks to it's awesome performance and quality.\n\nMy credentials:  I am a self proclaimed amateur photographer.  I've been taking photos for over 15 years and have owned a lot of gear.  What doesn't make the cut, finds it's way to ebay.  I will sadly be selling this lens because of it's crippled ability on my FX camera.  This is NO fault of Sigma though.  If anything, I wish they would make a dedicated FX lens in this range for a reasonable price);Awesome DX Lens

40;80.0;3.0;6.0;It's wide, very wide, and well priced. However, mine is not very sharp. For 50% of the conditions I shoot in, it's fine. However, it has a soft left hand side. I tried to get it replaced but the shop owner put up such a fuss that I gave up. Wish I had gone for the Tokina 11-16mm. My original kit lens is better than this and my primes just blow it away when it comes to sharpness. Could just be a poor copy as I have read many happy reviews.\n\nEDIT. May have been a little harsh. I took some night shots of the city where I live 2 days ago. I also decided to remove the filter (why did I not do this before). And yes, the images are a lot better. Still a tiny bit soft on the left but no real issue.;Not that good.
52;81.0;5.0;6.0;I just did some test shots comparing the Sigma 10-20mm and the Canon 10-22mm. The Sigma beat the Canon hands down on sharpness, brightness and color saturation without question. I've owned the Canon 10-22mm for almost a year and have never been satisfied with the softness of the images it produces. I've even sent it to the factory 3 times for adjustment. The tests I did today show the Sigma to be surprisingly the better lens hands down. It may be that I purchased a bad Canon lens, but after 3 trips to the factory for adjustment, I would think it would have been spotted. I'm constantly being told by reps how good the Canon 10-22mm is as it has the super UD glass and is supposed to be similar to L series quality. I've never seen this on my 40D and I'm now ecstatic to have found the Sigma to replace it. This is a great lens for a very nice price.;Better sharpness, brightness and color saturation than Canon's 10-22
18;82.0;5.0;5.0;I've had this one for nearly a year now, and with no hesitancy I can say this is a phenomenal lens for what you pay. For the Nikon there are a few select must-haves for the price, such as the 35 f/1.8 af-s, and this is one of the others. You get an EX line sigma lens that is sharp, built solid, and is optically ahead of what you pay. While the f/3.5 version is faster, and the 8-16 version is wider, this is a great balance for the price point. If you think the difference in either of the others is worthwhile then certainly they might work better for you, but at 10mm it is wide enough to capture any size room in its entirety. In comparison to the f/3.5 version, the 3.5 is somewhat soft at those larger apertures requiring an increased f stop to get to the same sharpness of this 10-20 variable aperture lens. Another consideration is that this lens takes standard 77mm filters. The 8-16 does not take any, and the f/3.5 version takes 82mm. If you already have standard 77mm ones or are planning to get some fx-sized gear, 77mm is what you will use.\n\nIn comparison to other DX ultra-wides it holds its own in sharpness, has the HSM motor to autofocus on lower end bodies such as the d40/d5000, and even on my D7000 is still sharp enough that with the higher megapixel count I do not have issues with softness anywhere in the frame, edge to edge. (unlike the 17-70 f/2.8 version)\n\nIf you value your money, this is the best bang for the buck ultrawide for DX/APS-C bodies. I've compared this to the Tokina 11-16 f/2.8 and the sigma is sharper all around, with better colors, contrast, 0 aberration, and better flare control. Only downside is that it is slower (which may be a little or a big downside depending on use). Highly recommended at this price point.;A must-have for DX/APS-C shooters

It seems sharper than the comparable Canon zoom which i have played with a couple of times, but that is just a feeling since I have not conducted side by side tests.  On my 7D it seems to be OK, not the sharpest lens by far, but being so wide its hard to tell.  Plus stopped down to f5.6 or f8, especially at a mid zoom of 13 -17 mm, everything is in sharp focus.  Contrast is good, not great, its no Ziess.  But its good, nothing a little tweak in lightroom can't fix.  At 100% crop its not the sharpest lens, and diffraction becomes noticeable above f8 on the 7D, but its still pretty sharp, and far wider than normal.  So I am willing to overlook a slight loss of resolution for the final image this allows me to get.  The final images are detailed and colorful with decent distortion control and not too much CA.  Of course there is no bokeh, just generic out of focus if you are sloppy.  I can almost touch my subject with this lens on the camera, you can get that close.  I think I can focus down to 4 or 5 inches reliably.  LR3 and CS5 do a great job of correcting the distortion and adjusting the perspective shift.  All in all for what it costs this is an awesome lens.  I think the only lenses in this price range with this appeal are the sigma 30 f1.4, the canon 50 f1.4 and canon 85 f1.8.  If you are on the fence, just get it, you won't be sorry.;fantastic lens
60;86.0;5.0;6.0;While there are many good reviews on Amazon for this lens reviews on other sites aren't so consistently rosy so it was with some trepidation that I awaited delivery of this lens. I should add here that I am an enthusiastic amateur and don't claim to be the most discerning photographer around but I like to think I recognize quality when I see it.\n\nAnyway, it arrived today and first impressions are good from the feel and handling to the couple of dozen photos I've taken so far in and around the house with my Nikon D50. The build quality feels as good as my Nikon 18-200 which has been my main lens since I bought it last year to replace the kit lenses that came with my D50.\n\nOther reviews I had read mentioned the fact that the front and rear lens caps are rubbish (they are) and so I had already ordered a 77mm Nikon cap as a precaution and I'm glad I did. Also be aware that the Tiffin filters which Amazon sells are lower quality and generally not multi-coated and that can apparently lead to reflection problems with a lens as wide as this. I bought a Sigma MC UV filter accordingly.\n\nWill post again if I come across an problems down the line but otherwise it's 5 stars for now!;good first impressions

It has been primarily been used for an architectural project. Working inside a remodel home project where you need it WIDE as possible. I found it met my needs at the very beginning. I used it with a Nikon D200 along with my kit lens, the Nikon 18-200. It was as sharp as the Nikon lens. Auto focus worked well without complaint. One area I did notice some viginetting was at an extreme wide angle and with a circular polarizing filter.  With the built in flash activated I got expected shadows of the lens barrel from 10 mm to 14 mm. Using the Nikon SB 800 flash there was no problem.\n\nI had done quite a bit of research before going with the Sigma 10-20 lens and am glad I saved all the bucks by not going with the Nikon 12-24. For my purposes this was just the right lens at the right time. I am extremely pleased.\n\nBill Keasling\nNewport Beach. CA";Super super-wide
67;88.0;4.0;6.0;"Recently ordered this to give as a Christmas gift, so not sure how well it works --\nhowever,\nif you are ordering from Amazon, a word of caution:  it arrived in a box with one small blow up bubble bag as its only padding, it was actually loose in the box where it was probably banged around.  The only padding was the thin case the lens comes in.  Horrible job of packaging, they treat it like its a textbook or something.  This needed to be packaged with styrofoam inserts at the least!  I was really shocked to find it so carelessly packaged - but to top it off, I also purchased a Tiffen lens and they had put it in the box outside of its packaging case!  No joke here.  I inspected it really carefully for scratches and don't ask me how it was not scratched, but it wasn't.  This is my first complaint with Amazon, but I realize they are not the place to buy high ticket items.  Their packaging is really ""care-less"".  Once the gift is opened and the lens is tried out, we will see if it is damaged or not, no way to tell at this point.\nJust a warning - this is not the place to order it - get it from a retailer instead, who takes care in packaging.";if you order this from Amazon ------
20;89.0;5.0;5.0;I have a Nikon D90 with the 18-105mm kit lens.  The 18-105mm was adequate for most applications but for indoors and wide-open landscape pics, it can be a challenge.  So, I started researching on wider angle than 18mm.  With a budget of around $500, it came down to this Sigma, Tokina 11-16mm and Tamron 10-24mm.  Based solely on the reviews here in amazon.com and a couple of other reputable online stores, I quickly ruled out the Tamron.  Back then, the Tokina was $200 more than the Sigma (now I'm seeing a store listing it for $599).  The Tokina is a f2.8 - very tempting offer but for me, I forsee most of my applications requiring both width and DEPTH, so f2.8 is nice to have but not a real deal-breaker.\n\nThe Sigma has the 10mm and 17-20mm range advantage over the Tokina's 11-16mm.  Eventhough there were a few reviews about bad copies of Sigma, I went ahead and bought one, knowing I can always exchange it until I get a good copy.  I bought mine here(but not sold by amazon.com - it was 47th St Photo).\n\nI can say I am very impressed with the build, material and image qualities of my Sigma.  In fact, all 3 qualities were better than my Nikkor 18-105mm kit and to be fair in my comparisions, all pics were taken in the 18-20mm range on both the Sigma and Nikkor.\n\nI highly recommend this Sigma.;Fantastic!
21;90.0;5.0;5.0;After spending countless hours reviewing the various UWA lenses, I settled on this Sigma 10-20mm lens. It isn't the fastest wide angle out there, but it is the only one at 10mm focal length at it's widest setting. After all, If you are going to buy a wide angle lens, why not buy the widest available (yet still affordable). I paid extra for next day shipping and the lens arrived promptly at 2:00 pm the next day. Although this is an Amazon purchase, I found the copy I bought from Amazon Warehouse deals, sold as a USED lens. The price was $80 less than brand new so I figured I'd give it a try, knowing that I could always return it if it was not in good shape.\n\nWhen the package arrived, I expected to open the box and see a used lens wrapped in paper or bubble wrap. I was surprised to find that the lens came in the original box with original warranty card still in place. But best of all, this lens appeared to be new in every way. There were a few fingerprints on the front element which I took care of with a lens tissue, but other than that, there was not so much as a hint of wear or handling issues.\n\nBut the real test is how this lens works (or not works). I put it on my D90 and it instantly recognized the lens and was ready to go.\n\nSo far, I have taken about a hundred test images to be sure I got a good copy of this lens. I was particularly impressed when i took a picture of the front of my wife's Ford Escape at 10mm and about 6 feet away. After bringing the image into my PC, The photo was tack sharp but the real surprise was that I could read the serial number on the small decals of her license plate as if I had used my sharpest Nikon fixed focal length lens.\n\nI am so pleased that Amazon's warehouse Deals had this (used?) lens for sale the day I decided to purchase one. If I didn't know better, and if there had not been finger prints on the front element when I opened the box, I would have sworn that this lens was brand new.\n\nGreat job Amazon.\n\nAl C., Professional Photographer;Bought this lens used from Amazon Warehouse Deals
26;91.0;4.0;5.0;"I bought this lens because my wife and I recently began a series of trips to view Civil War battlefields and historical sites in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri related to the ""Indian Removal"" by the US Cavalry. In this part of the country the two things sometimes overlap because some of the same forts were used as the Cavalry drove the Indians along the Trail of Tears (one quarter of them died along the way). The lens was purchased so I could shoot panoramic views of battlefields and gun emplacements, as well as wide shots of forts, barracks, etc. The lens that came with my K200 Pentax (great camera)--the 18-55 kit lens--has limited wide-angle possibilities, thus the Sigma 10-20. So far I haven't been to any new battlefield sites to test it, but, being a lazy photographer, I have left it on my camera after testing it, taking indoor shots of large paintings and close-ups of items I'm trying to sell on Ebay. Most of the stuff looks as good as it does with the kit lens, although I noticed a lot of blurring when I tried to get a little closer than the lens is designed to shoot (even though my camera is one of those shake-proof jobs). Just yesterday I got a great shot of the squirrel my wife insists on feeding just outside the kitchen window, through the glass. After I cropped it on the computer, out came this very smug little face looking directly at me as though to say, ""Ain't I cute? Keep the food coming if you want more of this!"" I'm really looking forward to using this lens on our upcoming trips to Civil War sites (there are some stunning panoramic views to be had ... for example at Pea Ridge in Arkansas, just below the Missouri border). So far it has worked great on big paintings that are well lighted, which my 18-55 lens makes me view from too far away to get the whole thing in. I'll update this after I try it at one of the battlefields. (Anybody interested in photographing battlefields should definitely not miss Pea Ridge. Other top-rank sites I have visited are the Union memorial at Vicksburg, Mississippi (GREAT views from high above the river where Grant spent more than a month bombarding Southern forces), and, very moving, the Battle of Little Big Horn in Montana.) Sorry if this entry is short on lens specifics and long on description.";Great so far
27;92.0;1.0;5.0;"I really was excited about getting this lens after reading all the reviews.  But unfortunately after just a few test shots it was quite clear something was seriously wrong.  Firstly the pictures were all overexposed.  Sure I could compensate, but still it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  But more seriously not one single picture (at either 10 or 20mm, or anywhere between) looked sharp.  I was careful to stop down as had been suggested by reviewers, but nothing I tried made a difference.  When I compared the Sigma pictures with the cheap 18-55 kit lens that came with my Canon T2i I could see immediately that the kit lens was far, far sharper.  I'm new to the world of digital SLRs, so I'm not sure if the problem is due to incorrect focusing or something more fundamentally wrong with the lens.  I've read that others have had to return their Sigma lens a couple of times before they got a ""good"" one.  I'm not sure I want to take my chances so I""ve returned mine for a refund.  On the plus side, if there is one, the Sigma seemed very sturdily constructed.  The 10mm capability seemed like it would be a lot of fun.  It's very disappointing.";I must have got a lemon...
79;93.0;5.0;6.0;I took the lens on an international trip and LOVED IT.  \I was amazed by how much it captures.  I used it for landscape  and portraits and it did a great job.  Sigma works well with the Canon Rebel XT digital.;Wide Angle lens
89;94.0;5.0;6.0;I work for a photography studio and I absolutely love this lens! Sharp, fast focusing, and reliable - but at a price that's more reasonable than others that are comparable. Sure there are others out there that may perform better, but I don't have the kind of money to drop on them! This is a great lens for it's price.;A quality lens
33;95.0;3.0;5.0;"It's not a bad lens by any means and it is a good price, however after using this lens and the Tokina 12-24mm lens I must say the Tokina is noticeably superior.\n\nAt 20mm the lens really shines, being sharp all the way to the corners. Unfortunately, however, at 20mm the vignetting is the worst of all focal lengths, which looks great in some photos and not good in others. It can only be partially corrected in PS.\n\nIn all focal lengths besides 20mm, the image becomes softer and softer on the edges as you approach 10mm. At 10mm, virtually every photo I took is unusable without cropping a few inches off each side of the photo. At 10mm, the edges are so soft that they look blurry and out of focus. Only the odd shot with leaves or water on both sides of the frame will forgive this weakness. From 11-15mm it is a little better but not much better. 16-20mm seemed to be the sweet spot for this lens with an emphasis on the 18-20mm part.\n\nNow, I now that this is to be expected somewhat with ultra-wide angle photography, and I am not claiming that the Tokina--or any other lens--is perfect in this respect either. The Tokina is, however, much less worse. At 12mm the Tokina is soft in the edges but not so much that it looks blurry or out of focus; it is as soft in the corners as you would expect an ultra-wide angle photo to be. Anyway, after shooting with this lens daily for a few weeks and seeing the results each night, the lens had a way of forcing me to stay as close to 20mm as possible. I was really disappointed to have to do so given that I would rather just have a 20mm lens than have a 10-20mm zoom that forced me to stay as close to 20mm as possible. I know a big attraction to this lens is the 10mm number, but I can't help but wonder if they got there by fudging the quality a little bit. I have resold this lens and will not buy it again. I will stick to the Tokina or a wide-angle prime in the future. I really wanted to like this lens but unfortunately it is only adequate. If you are only doing really artsy shots and don't mind blurred corners at 10-14mm then this should be great for you, but they are just too soft for me.";Sadly, I can not recommend this lens.
39;96.0;3.0;5.0;This is not a bad lens. It was a gift so it's hard to complain.\n  I also have a Canon 17-40mm. The Sigma is not as sharp as the Canon\n  but it is still acceptable for most photos. The superwide is just\n  as much fun to play with as a super telephoto. I have taken decent\n  photos throughout the aperture range although it seems to help if\n  you can get to an F11 or 13. I am having enough fun with this lens\n  that it's been on my camera for about a month now since I got it.\n  I would imagine Canon's version is a bit better if you can afford\n  it. If you are a hobbyist as I am, this lens will probably be good\n  enough.;about as expected
41;97.0;4.0;5.0;"This is a really w-i-d-e lens, made just for DSLRs. It can give you some great outdoor shots, and when you're trying to take in as much of a room as possible (like for insurance photos), the only thing wider is probably a fisheye. At a recent trip to the auto show it worked out pretty well; I was able to get right up to the concepts and fill the frame with the car rather than being forced to back up and include a lot of distractions. Some have reported problems with autofocus, but I've had no problems so far. A friend who ordered this lens several months before me was expecting the lens to have the HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) feature, which it did not. Turns out there was an error in the item description. Sigma describes this feature as being available on SOME models, not all, so it might not hurt to call before you order.";No problems here
44;98.0;5.0;5.0;Was always NIKON only,until I needed a wide angle zoom lens for my D40. Thats when I found SIGMA. The 10-20mm is great lens at half the price of the NIKON 12-24mm. Tried both lenses before buying the Sigma. It is clear, sharp, and well built. The HSM works great on my D40 & D60. For extreme wide angle and landscape its great -no problems.;great lens half for the price
45;99.0;5.0;5.0;I've been using this lens for a few months without any major complaints.  It can evidence vignetting at 10mm, which becomes more pronounced when you add a 77mm polarizing filter.  The physical motion is superb and it's a solid lens.  It's missing obvious hyperfocal markings, but you can use the focal length and distance marks to get accurate hyperfocus anyways.  I hope this helps others who use this lens.\n\nHyperfocal lens settings (partial list):\n\n10mm: f/5 @ 1m\n10mm: f/11 @ 1.5ft\n\n12mm: f/8 @ 3ft\n12mm: f/16 @ 1.5ft\n\n14mm: f/10 @ 1m\n14mm: f/25 @ 0.4m\n\n17mm: f/16 @ 3ft\n\n20mm: f/22 @ 3ft;Good motion, solid construction, vignetting at 10mm, list of hyperfocal distances.
83;100.0;5.0;5.0;Well, I really liked the Tamron wide angle lens which offered a zoom range that invited it to be the > one < lens you keep on your camera. With few exceptions, digital cameras self zoom a bit. So all lenses are more close up than their lens ratings would lead you to believe.\n\nTo go wide angle, in digital, you have to go very wide. But very wide angle lenses bring in some flaky things in color, dark corners, glare rings, and things to make nearly excellent shots just nice.. but .....mmmmmm\n\nThe ZOOM wide angle lenses magnify the weird stuff. So high quality wide angle usually means NOT zoom. The Tamron entry seemed to go wide enough that the SLR had that one all purpose lens which the film SLRs enjoy.\n\nThis is not that lens. The is - for digital - a really wide angle lens. The 10mm is crazy wide - in a zoom? But it works. Used outside, or in the right circumstances inside, is excellent. It is not the ONE lens for your SLR, unless you really don't like ever getting close up.\n\nI have this Russian made super crazy wide fixed focal length lens (nearly 180 degrees) which with adapter fits nearly anything. It is good at that very rare crazy wide shot. But this Sigma lens has all the auto features and graceful adaptation to being outdoors - where how wide varies with what direction. Nice image quality with low distortion.\n\nIt is a great second lens.;Wide angle digital lens.

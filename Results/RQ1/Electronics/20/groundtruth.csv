Seriously. Save your money and look else where. Here is why....\nWhen i ordered these speakers i received them in good packaging. However the Fluance team that works quality control must have taken the day off and these got shipped anyways.\nFirst of all these are built extremely cheap. Which i can understand with a price tag that they currently have. However, they were not working correctly straight out of the box. I have attached photos and a video of the terrible build quality. I hope this helps your decision.\n\nOn the front left speaker at the bottom there is cutouts in the compressed material which is used to screw in the feet of the speakers.  Over the compressed material is a cheap veneer finish. There is cutouts for brass rings so the feet can screw into. Unfortunately as you can see in the picture, they never added the 4th ring for the foot on the speaker.\nOn the front right speaker the connectors for the speaker are not even inserted or mounted properly. I literally can turn the whole entire speaker connector/ plug in a 360 degree. Im not even sure its connected to the actual speaker driver at this point. When i have the bridge connected either attached or not attached i will not get audio on the 8 inch bass driver.\nVideo listed for your viewing.\n\nSave your time. Do not get these speakers. Save a little extra money and buy a trusted brand like Polk Audio. I will be sending these back and asking for a refund. Hopefully their customer service is not as poor as their product and they will stand by either their warranty (which i should not have to pay shipping charges for. The speakers were broke or built incompletely when i got them) or they fully refund me and i send the speakers back.\n\nSeriously guys. Even though you see a high rating from other customers on this product do not buy them. The other speakers that are working sound great but the trade off is extremely poor quality and i doubt they will last.\n\nFluance even claims they are dedicated in providing the highest quality audio products on the market. If that's so then Fluance please help me and give be a better opinion of your company because right now, your products are pretty embarrassing.\nThis quality will definitely be damaging to your reputation.\n\nI hope Fluance can speak on this issue and help me out.";When i ordered these speakers i received them in good packaging.

13;3.0;5.0;31.0;They are the best speakers that I have heard for the price.;great
8;4.0;4.0;11.0;"I purchased this system based on the specs from Fluance Website but the speakers I received does not match the specs as stated on the website.\nThe front channel speakers' power handling is 20~120 watts(website 20~120 watts), the surround channel speakers' power handling is 30~60 watts (website 30~100 watts) and the center channel is 40~90 watts(website 10~100 watts). clearly this is not what I paid for!\nI don't know if this was an error or by design but either way, I am extremely disappointed with this purchase because for me to return them, it would cost me 3 times more than what I paid for them and I would still have to pay more to have them shipped to my country including my country's tax of 52% of the cost and shipping.\n\nFluance customer service reached out to me and assured me that this was only a labeling error and that the speakers were the correct specifications. Seeing that there was no way for me to test the speakers for the correct specs and that I would be out several hundred dollars to send them back; I trusted their word and hooked them up.\nThese speakers sounded great after setup and calibration. I only gave a 4 star because the binding posts on the floor standing speakers were loose and very flimsy. I opened the box and tightened them up but this only helped a little and after switching to a bipolar setup on the front speakers; a few of post would not tighten at all. I made up some bridges using banana plugs and they work fine. These speakers are among the best, if not the best, Ive listen to in this price range. Playing at reference level, I could not believe how clear and crisps these speakers are. Great tonal balance and with no noticeable distortion makes this a great buy for someone who wants great sounding speakers without breaking the bank. I later bought the Fluance AVBP2 Home Theater Bipolar Surround speakers for a full 7.2 surround system and all I can say is WOW!!";Did not get what I paid for but what I did get sounds great.
18;5.0;3.0;43.0;"These speakers, do NOT sound as good as the reviews would have you believe.  I ""upgraded"" from a Sony set, using a BIC America 10"" sub with both systems.  Sony is considered low end speakers (I disagree actually, but this is a review for Fluance) and my old setup is just as cheap as these speakers.  I saw the glowing reviews for these Fluance and I was even reading they blow away most 5.1 setups that cost $1000 or less.  Sounded too good to be true...but I learned an important lesson...do not go by reviews...go by your own ears.  This is the last speakers I ever buy sight unseen or without hearing them first.\n\nThese look nice,(but the Fluance logo is way too big) yet for the sound, they seemed to be missing something.  I'll tell you why; the center and surrounds are small and the center is too wimpy to provide a good sound signature.  I can say, with certainty, that I can chuck the center channel over my house!\n\nThese speakers do not sound bad, they just fail to sound good.  They have poor efficiency, so your receiver has to be fairly powerful to get the best sound out of them.  I have an Onkyo TX-SR706 Receiver driving these and the Sony's not only were louder at any given volume, they sounded really good in my room.  These Fluance sound very laid back and excel at nothing.  They lack the excitement and I actually seemed to hear subtle sounds in my old setup that were missing with the Fluance.  I believe in speaker break in, I know it is true because I have yet to buy a speaker set that did not sound slightly different after using them for a while.  I played the heck out of these, for over 40 hours, hoping they would open and I can hear the magical sound everyone has been raving about.  I still failed to find it, they sounded a bit more balanced but that was it.  My mom, girlfriend, and friends all agreed that these were inferior to my old setup.\n\nI was thinking, ""Maybe this is a poor receiver/speaker match"" (which can happen), so I hooked them into my Marantz system (which is the best sounding receiver I have heard in my life, mind you) and they did indeed sound better, yet they failed to impress me.  They still seem to be missing something; now I know sound is hard to describe, but these speakers have a ""lazy"" sound to them.  There is no dynamics which make you get the chills when you listen to a very musical song.\n\nThese look like you get a lot of bang for your buck, but even compared to low end speakers I have heard (Sony, KLH, etc.) these do not overtake those.  I had a bit of a hassle returning these as well, they only wanted to refund speaker price only, not the price of shipping back to them.  Thankfully, UPS damaged them and they came to me with some chips missing, so I got a full refund but it took me 5 phone calls (hearing a different story from each person I talked to) to get it.  They also had UPS pick them back up, free of charge.  It is nice the 30 day return policy, yet you also pay for shipping and they only refund the cost of the speakers, not the shipping.  For the asking price of these, you can do much better.  I bought Polk speaker set for not much more that finally is an upgrade from my Sony's and kills these in all ways, highs, mids, and bass.\n\nPros:\nNice looking\nShipped very quick\nDouble boxed\nDecent value for money\nMains Bi-Amp capable\nGold 5-way binding posts on all speakers\nWall mountable out of the box\nComes with spikes for mains\n\nCons:\nLack excitement or wow factor\nLight and easy to damage\nPoor center performance\ninefficient\nExpensive shipping (to be expected though)\nEasy to damage\nSuperior competition\nQuestionable return policy\nYou need a subwoofer with these, no questions asked (but I think a sub should always be used with any speaker system)\n\nNot only can you buy a Sony setup that will blow these away for around the same price, you can buy a HTIB setup that will give you better sound (from other speaker-only companies).  I will agree, you can easily do better than Sony, but the Sony towers, bookshelf, and center channel blew these away.\n\nFunny, this is my 3rd review and mysteriously they were never posted?  Wonder if this one will actually get posted, if not I will take issue to that as well.  None of them showed up, hope I am not wasting more typing?";Disappointed, you can do better even for the price
5;6.0;5.0;45.0;"I am am very pleased with these speakers.  Unbeatable sound for the price, period no argument!.  The so called ""Audiophiles"" try to Poo-poo these speakers and compare them to $2,000 to $10,000 speakers and then grudgingly admit they are pretty good.  The Quality of construction from the enclosures to the connections are excellent.";Value, Value, Value
17;7.0;5.0;28.0;Ok I am not an snobbish audiophile.\nI like good quality, but I am not willing to pay through the nose to get the absolute best since the wife and kids are usually making noise in the house so phenominal sound quality is drowned out by nagging and yelling from somewhere.\nI have these set-up with the following:\nOnkyo 606 receiver\nSony Blu-ray S570\nXbox 360\nSamsung 1080p 120Htz TV from a few years back.\nI watch movies and listen to music and game on these and they do a great job. The price is a great incentive to getting them also.\nIn the size room the speakers are in I don't require a sub-woofer.\nI had a grenade go off next to me in MW2 and the speakers rattled the house, the kid's and I got that mischievious grin on our faces...I was happy. The wife? She thought the kids were fighting in the family room and fell on the floor and wasn't happy... I was hooked.\ngood quality sound, solidly built, but a little big if you want something that is going to blend into a room.;Better than most
3;8.0;5.0;34.0;I researched different speakers ranging from these Fluance speakers to $600 Klipsch speakers.  From all the research, I only found one non-biased negative which was that the speakers can't handle too much power.  All others said they sound great at a very low price.  I can handle the low power handling on these speakers as I'm running them with an Onkyo SR-606 which outputs 90 watts (according to the tech. specs).\nThe lows, the highs, they all sound great and clearly coming through these speakers coming from Blu-Ray movies, the radio tuner, and TV shows.\nFor the price, you can't go wrong with these speakers and I will consider another set for another room setup.;Excellent Speakers
10;9.0;5.0;6.0;Sound amazing. Instantly fell in love.  You won't find a set that sound as good as these for the price. I have over 50hrs researching before coming to these and used them daily everyday since nov2015 with a denon s500bt & polk audio 10in sub for a house shaking sound like no other. I can head on other side of the house when its only 1/2the way turned up on 50. Excellent set up love these canadian speakers!!!;Excellent speakers!!! Used daily for 3+ months and work amazing! Buy now!
11;10.0;5.0;6.0;"For the money, you can't beat them. I thought I had already reviewed these speakers, but they are on my Amazon list to review, so here I go. I had to split them up some. They are too small to use in my living room as a whole unit. I did place the center speaker in the living room, on the opposite side of the room. I now have right and left center speakers, so they can be heard on both sides of the room. I used the tower speakers as my surround speakers (because I am not giving up my 3 way speakers with 10"" subs, for these smaller towers), and then I placed the small speakers in another room. For someone who is starting out and wanting to save money, these are perfect. Or if you have a small room, and you only have enough room for a smaller set, then this is perfect. I more or less, wanted to see what you get for such a small amount of money. I knew that I can always find a place for an extra speaker or 2, or 3, etc.. They are very well constructed and they do sound very good compared to a lot of them that cost you hundreds of dollars more.";Save some money and buy them
9;11.0;5.0;5.0;... got these three weeks ago as a replacement for a older 5.1 setup paired them with the sub and the old towers that moved to the rear corners, resulting  7.1 sounds  better and the kids could not be happier for movies and gaming, would like a second sub as a side note;speakers and
4;12.0;4.0;30.0;They sound really good and considering that they only cost $200 that makes them a great deal.  These speakers sound better than any home theater in a box speakers I've heard.;Solid for the price.
12;13.0;4.0;6.0;After researching different speakers I decided to buy these Fluance speakers. Quality of these speakers is really good. In addition to this the look of these speakers is also nice and they go very nicely with the decor. I have attached these speakers to my Yamaha RX-V677 7.2-channel Wi-Fi Network AV Receiver.\n\nThese speakers do not sound really good and if you have really good receiver it adds up. Only thing I didn't like is buying additional sub-woofer and it is not part of the deal. I purchased Polk Audio PSW505 12-Inch Powered Sub-woofer to complete the system.\n\nSome of the reviewers mention that NO USER MANUAL. I have seen the users manual but it is of no use and doesn't have more details. Accessories came with these speakers has some golden threaded plus . To be frank I don't know what is use of those. I wish manual has some details about all this.\n\nBut overall these speakers are really good. I am going to add two additional speakers to make my system 7.2\nPlease watch the YouTube review of these speakers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3TRt1mhFPQ;Good Speaker system at reasonable price
16;14.0;4.0;19.0;"In 1991 I decided to get new speakers , spefically bookshelf speakers so I went to a store called Lechmere, that no longer exists. Lecmere had an amazing set up where they had hundreds of kinds of speakers and Amps and you could try different amps with different speakers. I go there at 10AM, armed with a CDs of the Moody Blues , U2, and some digitally recorded classical and Jazz. at 2pm I settled on The Design Acoustics DS-10 speakers and an Onkyo Amp. These speakers have lasted me through many apartments over 4 states and they never failed to provide rich lows (10"" subwoofer that faced down) and sharp clear highs and mid range. Over that time I tried putting in other speakers, including Bose that a friend wanted to sell me and I just could not escape the tinny feel that they had. They just did not approach the same richness of the DAs. I could have got a subwoofer, but that would only have helped for movies and I listen to a lot of music. Finally, this year my wife forced my had to get some floor standing speakers so I started researching. I did not want to spend 10K on speakers to get equivelent sound. I did a ton of research before buying these and gave myself an entire day to rewire the room. It was a very emotional experience for me. The DAs and I have been together for 20 years and they have been so good to me\n\nTHE BAD: The speakers came in one large very heavy box and I discovered to my chagrin, DOES NOT HAVE AN OWNERS MANUAL! This is fine if they offered one online, but they do not. Support, however, was very good and spent the time to explain that they provide all the info via a FAQ on their website under ""Education"" . The speakers come with floorstand spikes which raise the speakers off the floor, but if you have never had floorstanding speakers before there is no way to know what they are for and , of course, there is no manual to explain it. Additionally, because I haven't had new speakers in 20 years I was unaware of the Bi-AMP capabilities of the speakers all I saw was 2 inputs and had no idea why. Had there been a manual, this would be no problem. Support showed me where to find the links on the website that explained it and it turns out if you just leave it alone and plug into the top or the bottom it will work fine. This is the only reason I took off a star.\n\nThe GOOD: the speakers sound fantastic! rich deep bass, clear midrange , sharp highs. I used my DVD player ""Lord of the rings"" and the theater sound was so full and rich it was overwhelming, making me realize I need a bigger and better TV. Xbox music played beautifully on 3 channel stereo and filled the house with sound, but that allowed you could still pick out each instrument clearly and the vocals that sound like they are in the room with you. I am still playing with the Settings on My Amp (onkyo) , but so far I m really overwhelmed, and though my old speakers will always have a place in my heart my new ones are making themselves easy to love.";The rich sound that I was hoping for
14;15.0;1.0;6.0;The system sounded good at first. But then I noticed a strange sound coming from one of the surround speakers. It took me a while, but I discovered that one of the surround mid range speakers was defective. And I'm stuck without a way to exchange the bad speaker after not having the system for more than 3 months.;The system sounded good at first
15;16.0;5.0;6.0;i can appreciate good sound. these speakers deliver in every respect. crisp sound, no boomy effects from any of the drivers, well put together, and look really decent. these are great sounding speakers, not just great for the price, but great, period. i upgraded to these from an ancient set of powered sonys. good mid and highs, and surprising bass, not beat the doors down, make the dog piss himself bass, but it is there with some presence. you WILL still need a subwoofer to finish off the set. sensitivity is a bit low, but fix that by throwing plenty of power at them, im using a sony str-dh520 avr totaling 135 w/c and these sound great up to about 90% after that im pretty sure most drivers under a few thousand start to get a bit whiny.\n\ni ended up using these guys as part of my low budget home theater set up, paid 269 for these, 219 for the avr, and 279 for the sub (bic america pl-200)... built what i will say is a great sounding system for well under a grand. do yourself a favor, stop hesitating, and buy these.;not an audiophile, but...
2;17.0;5.0;9.0;You could actually get away with no sub for music playback. I only turn my sub on when I am watching a program that requires it. I have been using and building audio and PA systems for over 45 years, these things sound great. You can't match the quality for 3X the price anywhere. Clean Clear Flat response, no distortion. Get a good amp, use good wire and enjoy.\nThese things come from Canada. Got them in about a week. Shipping was 1/4 the price of the speakers and worth every penny.;Havent bought these yet?
19;18.0;5.0;6.0;I did a lot of research before purchasing these speakers and was willing to spend up to $500 on a 4.0 to 5.1 system. I love Boston Acoustics speakers and swore I would buy a set. However, the mid sized Boston speakers were all very expensive. I researched other possibilities online and found Fluance. I never heard of this brand and it kind of scared me. I thought they may be like the cheap radio shack speakers you could buy back in the 90's. I was convinced by the many positive reviews and bought the Fluance package. These speakers are amazing. Nice crisp highs and great bass reproduction for the size. I will eventually buy a powered sub so I can lower the strain on the frond drivers, but for now everything is great. I don't think I have heard a better system for less than $1000. I can't imagine finding a better deal for awesome speakers.;Wonderful speakers for the price!
0;19.0;5.0;5.0;"I own these speakers..for starters, you'll want a sub, though the towers are pretty nice. For the price, the sound and build quality of these speakers is amazing. Go to the site and read other reviews and you'll see what I mean. I found these after doing A LOT of research. They're built SOLID and HEAVY..no cheap, crappy enclosures. The name isn't too well known..they don't sell them in ""box stores"", so the price is low. Don't let that fool you. I took a chance and bought these without hearing them first..something I NEVER do, and I'm thrilled that I did...these speakers, in this price range, are the real deal. The highs are crisp (which I like) but NOT harsh...AND they're WELL PACKAGED also. Mine came from Eastern Canada to where I live on the coast of Washington State, a LONG way, and NOT A SCRATCH..even the packaging was in good condition! Sure, there's better speakers, but if you don't have a lot of money to spend, these are a GREAT DEAL, so much so that I feel compelled to tell people about them..Again, for this price range, you won't be disappointed! Edit:4-29-11 I DID replace the center. These speaks are power hungry and the center is a weak link anyway. I replaced it with a Polk CS-10 and the difference is night and day...added a Bic Acoustech H-100 sub and as far as I'm concerened, for what I need, I'm DONE! (spending money!)";"Great Deal! (a real ""sleeper!"")"
1;20.0;5.0;5.0;These are some great speakers, the construction and price makes them a great purchase.  I would def... recommend them to anyone.;Army Sgt

1300;1.0;5.0;7187.0;I am coming back from the future to write this review, and to let everyone know you can buy this TV for $699 in 2017. It still looks great though.;Back from the future...
1271;2.0;5.0;7183.0;I was going to fund my daughters wedding in Hawaii, but I figured this Samsung TV would last much longer.;What wedding?
1373;3.0;1.0;5943.0;It makes those abused animal commercials with the sarah mclachlan music playing so much sadder when the one-eyed pug is 4 feet tall.;So sad
691;4.0;5.0;3405.0;Just cashed in the kids' college funds and dropped them off at the Army recruiting station. I got the TV, they got a career. I think it worked out well for everyone.;Amazing Experience
871;5.0;3.0;3465.0;Take my advice and shop around, people. I bought a twelve-pack of these at Costco and saved a hundred grand.;OK, but not the best deal
1447;6.0;5.0;3483.0;At first I hesitated to make the purchase, but then I saw the two AA batteries were free with the remote, and I was all in!  Having this really fills in that empty space we called a bathroom!;Did you see it comes with FREE Batteries?
679;7.0;5.0;3151.0;This tv is fan freaking tastic!!!! We are now living in the box it came in but even that is roomy and quite comfy!!!!;Home!!!
1330;8.0;5.0;3269.0;I purchased this for my Atari 2600 and wow did it make a difference!  Also, I am very thankful that it has low energy costs as I am on a very tight budget.;Fantastic!
1314;9.0;3.0;2972.0;I bought it just to watch the garbage man struggle pitifully as he attempted to fit the box into the back of his recycling truck. Worth it.;Watch the recycling man cry
1375;10.0;5.0;2946.0;It fits perfectly into the arms of the T-Rex fossil I just brought home from China.  It's like YOU KNEW, Samsung.  Thank you.;Best poolside model yet
643;11.0;3.0;2021.0;The black levels and color depth on this TV are pretty good for the price. However, the small screen size is a deal breaker. I recommend buying an IMAX theater instead.;Too small
407;12.0;5.0;1718.0;People!!! Be advised! With the Amazon.com Rewards Visa card you can save $30 off the listed purchase price - $30!!!;READ B4 BUYING!
321;13.0;5.0;1093.0;This is the best TV out there for watching documentaries about starving children. You can really feel their pain.;Compassion in High Def
1418;14.0;5.0;1534.0;"When comparing TVs here, I saw Amazon also sells an 84"" Toshiba model for just $13K.  But I got this one instead, and haven't regretted the purchase, because as a rather insecure male, it's well worth the extra $27K to have that extra inch.";Worth it...well, for me anyway.
1099;15.0;5.0;1481.0;Has anyone bought this yet? My wife told me that she would leave me if I purchased it and I was wondering if this TV would be worth it.;Haven't actually bought it yet. Thinking about it
260;16.0;5.0;997.0;Watched Twilight on this.\n\nMovie still looked terrible.;Broken promises
1443;17.0;5.0;1375.0;We originally got this television when our nephew moved in.  It has been a wonderful addition to the house for our nephew.\n\nYou see, our nephew was born and bred in West Philadelphia, where he spent most of his days playing basketball and relaxing. That was until a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble.  It seems he got into one little fight, my sister got scared and told him he was moving in with myself and my husband here in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles.\n\nIt was a tough adjustment period.  How someone can find the stinkest cab from LAX IS BEYOND ME right off the plane.  But when he got to the house and saw this television hanging in our kitchen by the sliding doors?\n\nHe knew he was finally here!  He said he felt like a prince.\n\nEveryone loves it.  Our son loves dancing to Its Not Unusual on its sound system and personally for myself the detail really helps me see my fave plastic surgery shows (as I have completely changed how I look in less than two years.)\n\nThe price is a little low on what we were expecting, but hey:  The price is as unbelievable as our lives.\n\nThank you, Samsung!\n\nVivian Banks\nBel-Air, California;This Television is Fresh!
733;18.0;1.0;1122.0;Asolutely worthless for watching midget porn. They all look normal size. And the remote control by hand gesture feature has some serious drawbacks...;Too big
1363;19.0;5.0;1158.0;When I watched Chuck Norris on this TV it cured me of Cancer.  It also got my pit bull pregnant (which I thought was a coincidence until all the puppies were born with mullets).;After watching this TV the real world looks pixelated and fake
977;20.0;5.0;1027.0;I was moments away from purchasing this tv. But once I saw that it was not Prime Eligible, I bailed.;Great tv
1245;21.0;1.0;950.0;Bought one on a whim this weekend while running errands, but quickly returned it when I realized it wouldn't fit in the trunk of my car. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who drives a '92 Ford Fiesta.;about 65 inches too big
962;22.0;5.0;892.0;I saw this TV and said I have to have it. I didn't have the money to pay for it, but my long lost cousin, who is a prince in Nigeria said, if I give him my social security number and my bank information, he will wire me the money. Thank you prince Zumba Zumba Zumba.;Can't wait!!!!!!
1346;23.0;5.0;891.0;I was going to send my two kids to college but I knew I had to do what was best for my family so I got this beast instead. I'm fairly positive my wife will end up coming back, I'm sure she'll realize how unreasonable she was being.  Marriage for 20 years or a tv thats 85 inches? Last time I checked, 85 is bigger than 20.;It was all worth it
1462;24.0;5.0;869.0;With the $5000 discount provided by Amazon, I couldn't help but buy 10 of these bad boys. I had my servants mount them to the ceiling of my G4 jet and wired GoPro cameras to the roof. Now it's like I'm flying in a convertible G4. Get on my level. BALLING OUT OF CONTROL!;Convertible G4
1329;25.0;5.0;747.0;"I was planning to go to college but then I thought to myself, ""What would be a better investment?"" Let's just say the Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV looks a lot better on the wall than any college diploma could.";Great Investment!
773;26.0;5.0;686.0;Excellent! Bought this to replace my broken Nook... I can now read an entire book on one page! FANTASTIC! Nice!;Great make-shift e-book reader! Wow!
761;27.0;5.0;668.0;The resolution is so high you can peer into people's souls. Did you know Alex Trebek murdered a hitchhiker back in 1983 just for the thrill of it? I didn't until I watched Jeapordy on this display. Great buy!!;Are you ready to lose faith in humanity?
8;28.0;5.0;707.0;I needed an additional television for my breezeway walking from the side courtyard to the master quarters. Ever since Carlton renovated the Elephant exhibit, I only have the noise of the waterfall and the Harp player outside. Regardless, I love how easily it was for the commoners to attach the television to work with the people mover we have around the complex. I had to order 3 more, 1 for the master bath, 1 for the tennis court and I felt the 70 inch 3d television the commoners had in their basement dwellings needed an upgrade.\n\nI do say, I wish it was available in solid gold or platinum. That way I could easily distinguish what quadrant of the complex I'm in.;Simply Amazing
686;29.0;5.0;654.0;when checking out my selfies on the slideshow feature, i can now honestly say i have a 4 and a half foot penis;slide show feature
1255;30.0;5.0;684.0;When I found out that Samsung accepted human kidneys as a form of payment I was overjoyed.  The price was one and a half kidneys so I told em to keep the change and just take both of them.  I'm just out of surgery and the set looks great in the ICU...well from the bed I can see half of it in the nurse's station.  Funny...I didn't think you could survive without any kidn;Bet your life on this TV!  Best picture ever!
401;31.0;5.0;587.0;Turns out there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll. Can see him plain as day now. Bad teeth.;That solves that
1377;32.0;4.0;603.0;Great unit... the only problem is that it puts out so many lumens of HD TV power that it vaporized my cat.  All I have left to remember Mister Tiggums is a Hiroshima-like flash-shadow on the far wall of my apartment.  Judging by the shadow, he was licking himself when he was nuked by 85 inches of Samsung awesomeness.  All I can say is that he went out a happy cat!;I'll Miss you Mister Tiggums.
755;33.0;1.0;527.0;Good lord this makes pornography terrifying.  Watching sweat pool in the pock marks on the inside of someone's thighs is absolutely horrifying.;DO NOT BUY THIS FOR PORN
808;34.0;5.0;516.0;My husband thought it was much too expensive. But after I took out an accidental death and dismemberment life insurance policy in his name, I was able to afford to buy it. Too bad he is not here to enjoy the amazing picture!;Well worth the price. I miss you honey!
1332;35.0;5.0;534.0;I was looking around for something I could buy that would have a large box. My kids really love making them into forts. I would say the joy on their face after I threw out the tv and have them the box was worth every thousand. My cat loves it also can't get him out of it.;Love the box
1361;36.0;1.0;533.0;I would have  given it more then one star, but as i was watching discovery channel they showed a shot of a beach. The  beach looked so real i got off my couch and jumped through the screen thinking it was an actual ocean... and apparently that isn't under warranty.;TOO REAL
1435;37.0;5.0;533.0;Great TV but I must warn you. YOU WILL spoil the help if you allow them to gaze upon it's wonder. Also, the eyes of the poor emit microscopic particles that will deteriorate image quality over time.;Poor People's Eyes will ruin this TV.
1302;38.0;5.0;504.0;It took me 1200 trips to the sperm bank and numerous bandaids from all the scabbing to raise the money for this beast, but boy was it worth it. It was a win win.;Epic!
256;39.0;4.0;350.0;Pros: Just big enough, moderately priced, great for gaming.\n\nCons: Screen gets so true to black that police shoot at it for no reason.;Best TV I've ever purchased
291;40.0;5.0;345.0;My wife told me if I bought this she'd never speak to me again. Finally I have some peace.;Worth Every Penny!
1262;41.0;5.0;486.0;I got cancer and had no money for treatment. I started making and selling meth and bought the TV. The radiation which came out of this TV worked as chemotherapy and cured my cancer too.;Cured my cancer!!!
1459;42.0;5.0;465.0;"We got this beauty to replace the bridge's main viewscreen after the last time Sulu traded paint with the Excelsior. And thanks to Spock's idea to gaffer tape the remote to my left-hand armrest on the Captain's chair I can now ""mute"" Khan whenever he starts ranting about Antares Maelstroms and perdition's flames and what not.....\n\nKirk J.T.";Great Replacement T.V.!!!
1450;43.0;4.0;461.0;Don't forget to use your Discover 5% cash back for online purchases until end of December. That's another 2000 off this amazing price.;Deal of the century
752;44.0;1.0;421.0;I bought this to use with my Nintendo 64, but the picture was too pixilated.  Each pixel was about the size of a poor person's tv.  Really disappointed in samsung. I bought a movie theater instead.;Not Compatible with my N64...Bought a movie theater instead
1215;45.0;1.0;444.0;This was my first upgrade since 1974, had to send it back as there was no channel-changer knob or volume control. Stuck watching Wheel of Fortune and other shows I don't like. Recommend buying after they iron out the kinks.;First Upgrade Since 1974
963;46.0;2.0;438.0;I was looking at the product specifications and it said the unit weighs 189 pounds and the shipping weight is 319 pounds. How much does that remote weigh?;I don't think my wife can change channels
766;47.0;5.0;408.0;I bought this after raiding my son's college fund.  Before you slash at me with negative comments, the kid is 23 and works at Taco Bell. That ship has sailed.  Anyway, my biggest gripe with this TV is that I just saw Justin Bieber's arrest photo on the news in total HD super-duper clarity. Did you guys know that chick's a dude?;Almost too clear...
1270;48.0;5.0;399.0;Over the last few years I having been working eighty plus hours a week and eating Ramen noodles three times a day in order to save enough money to purchase a slave.  I looked all around when I found one named Amanda.  Her father told me that she was a very hard worker, but he needed to sell her because he needed the money for a new television.  Because he was asking 30 grand, I thought that this must be one hell of a television.\n\n I told the man that I would get back with him, and I immediately went home and checked out the television he was taking about.  After reading the reviews here on Amazon,  I decided to buy this TV instead of the slave.  (Turns out that I would have run afoul of the law for owning a slave anyway.)\n\nFolks, let me tell you, I do not regret that decision one bit.  The picture quality on this thing...!  I just watched that Hoveround commercial where those senior citizens are just a sneeze away from steering their wheel chairs into the Grand Canyon, and I literally gasped out loud.  It's that real!;Worth it!
1316;49.0;3.0;397.0;It's difficult to know precisely how to judge an item such as this. On the one hand, it is massive, as advertised, and it is Ultra HD, as advertised. But the other night, when watching my beloved Knicks lose yet again, when I noticed the high definition forlornness of Carmelo Anthony, erstwhile hope of New York. He shook his (life size) head, disappointed in his teams performance, fighting back tears. He was falling apart.\n\nHe was literally falling apart, at the molecular level. Thanks to the unbounded resolution offered by the Samsung UN85S9, I could see deeper and more clearly into the picture than ever before. I could see the electrochemical reactions taking place in his eyes as he watched the clock tick down on yet another defeat. I could see the spaces and synapses between his cells opening up as he slumped further into his courtside seat. I could see these cells more clearly by the second as I focused, as if I were gazing deeply into a magic eye picture, only the magic eye picture revealed not a boat or a car but the very essence of humanity: that we are nothing more than an amalgamation of independently functioning cells struggling to survive and make sense of a cruel, cruel universe.\n\nI shouted at the voice-controlled television Obscure again the truth, foul mirror! Conceal from me the doom of my organic being! The TV responded by microdimming the picture, but the truth, the horrible horrible truth, remained dazzlingly clear.;A Mirror Unto Our Own Mortality
1072;50.0;5.0;385.0;"I didn't actually purchase this item but Amazon's ""Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed"" section allowed me to discover this gem&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Male-Power-Mens-Black-Collared-Body-Harness-Mankini/dp/B00CQCMP4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Male Power Mens Black Collared Body Harness Mankini</a>&nbsp;that has absolutely changed my life.";Lead me to a life changing discovery
822;51.0;5.0;354.0;I was dubious at first about it's only needing 2 AA batteries, but when they arrived I noticed that they were dilithium crystal based so they could also be used in my Type II Phaser.;Amazing
647;52.0;5.0;349.0;Well it took me stealing 70 million Target Customers credit cards but I can now afford the tv of my dreams! It was a good thing I still had a few more of your Credit card # left over that I could use them to buy a nice pair of Oakley sunglasses because this thing is as bright as the sun.;Thank you target customers!
1439;53.0;3.0;369.0;There's a lot of carping here about the price. $40,000 is indeed a fair whack of change for a television but on the other hand I spent almost twice that on my Thai mail order bride.  My bride didn't come with an on/off switch and nor does she hold up at viewing distances of under 5 feet so I ask which one was the bargain?  The sex is better with the Samsung too.;Water proofing is suspect.
802;54.0;5.0;338.0;So, I'm looking to spend $40,000 on a tv, but I can't decide whether I should buy this one, or just buy 40 regular 50-inch TVs and combine them into one huge mega-tv. I'm hoping maybe someone has tried both and could offer me some advice.;Need help with a tough decision
1243;55.0;5.0;336.0;I bought this thinking the price was listed in Mexican pesos. When I realized I was wrong it was already too late. I had hooked this beast up and I fell in love with it. My bank told me I could either keep my house or this TV...  Thank god the cardboard box this TV came in is extra large.;The Bank totally understood!
830;56.0;5.0;318.0;So what if I can no longer afford the mortgage and my wife left me. The Super Bowl is gonna look fabulous on my $40,000 HDTV. I just have to remember to put the box in front of my neighbor's house so mine isn't the one that gets robbed.;Sold my wife's car and jewelry.
1238;57.0;1.0;312.0;"I unwisely chose the ""Drone Delivery"" option, but the massive girth of the Samsung required attachment of 150 drones.  As they approached flying in close formation and blaring Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, the sky grew dark and the winds blew wild, closing air space and stopping all inbound and outbound flights at Dulles, Reagan National, and Richmond International.  Imagine my surprise when the knock on my door wasn't Rosey the Amazon Delivery Robot, but henchmen from the FAA.  Hopefully the technology on this television will still be current when I'm out of federal custody in 5-10 years.";Number of drones required rivaled beach scene skies in Apocalypse Now.

1203;59.0;1.0;236.0;I bought It for gaming but minecraft still looks the same. Very disappointing. I really thought this would improve my gaming experience dramatically.;I can see individual pixels
344;60.0;3.0;162.0;"Well you look at the price and think WOW!  I know right!  Unbelievable deal....too good to be true.  But, buyer beware.  First, delivery is an extra $10,000 since it took a highway patrol oversized load escort and the closing of several major roadways to just get it to my house.  Once it arrived I was none too pleased that it wouldn't fit through a standard sized 36"" front door, so we had no choice but to remove part of our roof and rent a crane to get it in the house.  Oh and don't think a standard wall mount will work, we had to have a custom carbon fiber wall mount made on site...there goes another $5000!!  Well once the tv was mounted on our 9 ft tall wall we realized the bottom of the tv was only two inches off the floor anyways!!!!  So there we are finally ready to turn this bad boy on and then realized it doesn't have the standard three prong plug.  It was the same giant plug our dryer has!!  Ugh!  So now we had to call an electrician to come install a new receptacle....there goes another $500! Finally all ready to turn it on....the picture is amazing to say the least...............\n\nWell it's been a little over three weeks now and I just received my electric bill....$6575.00!!!!!!!!  Needless to say I only had one option now.....you guessed it, having a giant wind turbine installed in the back yard next week($875,000).";Buyer Beware!
774;61.0;5.0;213.0;My fiancee said the money I spent on this TV was supposed to be for our wedding and to either take it back or she's leaving.  The TV would never make me choose, so the choice practically made itself.  Samsung saved me from what surely would have been a loveless marriage to a bitter, selfish wench.;Saved me from a bad decision.
1231;62.0;5.0;219.0;This TV has made all my dreams come true. Now all I do is watch Law and Order reruns, and stand real close next to Jerry Orbach and Chris Noth, chainsmoking, and wearing nothing but a trench coat. It's like I'm on the force! I'm the third partner they never knew they had, or knew was touching them.;Now Law and Order can be my real life!
1209;63.0;5.0;207.0;Nothing tells others that you have made it better than a TV with the surface area of an average swimming pool. Sometimes when my self esteem is low I like to video tape myself watching this Samsung behemoth and then play it back and watch on the giant screen.\nSome say that spending $40,000 on a TV is self indulgent and stupid since millions of Americans are struggling just to make ends meet. This is why I dropped off the box the TV came in downtown and it is now being used as a house for a homeless family. Trickle down economics works!;Fills that empty hole in your soul.
280;64.0;5.0;143.0;I was torn between this and a Dodge Charger until I remembered my $10 Amazon gift card I got for helping my buddy move.;I was torn between this and a Dodge Charger until ...

746;67.0;1.0;188.0;"I bought six of these Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTVs (Black) expecting to create a holodeck for me and the little tykes.  You know, like in star trek.  I opted for the black model to show people I'm not a racist.  Well, needless to say, the installation was a pain.  The combined weight of six Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTVs (Black) were heavy. They also didn't come with the Dilithium crystals to power it, prompting another online purchase. (I got the crystals from WALTERWHITEdotCOM, not through amazon).\n\nOnce I finally get it set up, I get inside and fire the sucker up with some good old ""Africa: the Serengeti (Narrated by James Earl Jones, spared no expense).""  I got lost for 4 days and couldn't find the exit.  I didn't bring any water, not anticipating being in there for that long, and I was getting delirious.  I ran toward a river expecting to drink, and it would turn into pixels once I got close enough.  They say 3d, it's more like 3.5d.  The 3d objects were solid to the touch, though you can't move or manipulate them.  A snake actually bit me, and I think a lion was stalking me.\n\nThe worst part was my 3yr old knows how to use the DVD player, and had changed the movie from my documentary to Barney.

I eventually started to punch viciously at Baby Bop until I managed to punch a hole though one of my Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTVs (Black). It was at that point I remembered where I was, and deftly exited the DIY holodeck.\n\nOnce I was free, I promptly called the company to see if my Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTV (Black)  was still under warranty, but they refused to replace it stating they didn't cover physical damage due to dumbeffery, and rudely referred me to section ID-10t of the manufacturers warranty agreement.  Who actually reads the fine print on this stuff.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing any more Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTVs (Black) since I had to sell a kidney to afford it, and I need the remaining kidney to pee.\n\nPros:\n-Fancy\n-Self Cleaning\n-Chuck Norris Approved\n\nCons:\n-Not fist-proof\n-Lacks the 99.6% pure blue dilithium crystals\n-3D images not edible/drinkable\n-Not compatible with WebTV\n-Creates more radiation than a CT scan\n-Drone delivery not available for it.\n-Despite being a so called ""Smart"" TV as advertised, it does not have a college degree.

186;71.0;5.0;134.0;It has been 11 days since our TV became self aware.  My wife and I have barricaded ourselves in our bedroom.  I knew watching Terminator on a TV of this caliber was a bad idea.  The TV has recruited the blender, toaster oven and treadmill to do its bidding.  TRAITORS!  If only I hadn't parted ways with my extensive gun collection to be able to afford this TV.  If you are reading this consider yourself warned....;Day 11.... Supplies are running low.
1464;72.0;5.0;188.0;"I bought this TV as an attempt to brighten up the main foyer of my 14th century Castle.

But with the addition of this TV, a couch from IKEA and some throw pillows, I am ready to have guests over to watch episodes of Breaking Bad anytime.\nThe only difficulty I had was trying to pay amazon in gold.

428;74.0;5.0;172.0;I bought this unit for the family room. I was originally skeptical of paying $40,000 for a TV, but I got over giving up a lung and pimping my girlfriend out to underground Asian prostitution pretty quickly after the first time I fired it up.  The picture quality is amazing. Real life pales in comparison to this 4K resolution and pixel density. A side perk is that the staggering amount of lumens this television generates heats the first floor of my house. I was able to shut down one of the zones completely and am now actually saving money by purchasing this TV!  So what if I will never be able to get on a treadmill again. Running is overrated. Samsung, well done sirs, well done indeed.;Buy this TV, never exercise again and save on heating bills!

I got a nice vacation, and the authorities came knocking on my parents' door. Best part is? The investigator said I could keep the TV. Let me tell you, this thing is so sweet. It's like I'm in the movie. All my friends love to come to my house. With no parents and this awesome TV, it's like party central every night!;My parents sold me into slavery to buy this TV...

1307;78.0;5.0;153.0;The way it swivels is fantastic, just fantastic. When I was in the market for a TV to replace my house I always wondered how I would stay dry when it rained and this TV had both the size and the ingenuity I needed. Whenever it starts to rain I simply flip the screen to horizontal, hunker down, and I stay nice and dry. The only problem, and I mean only problem, is when it's in this position I can't cook on the fire because as the smoke rises, it gets on the screen and leaves a gross residue that needs to be cleaned off. It's not that it's terribly hard to clean it, I just have to rent a scissor lift from the hardware store and it's kind of a pain so I just try to refrain from cooking or having a fire when it's raining. Initially, when I first moved into my TV, it took a little bit of adjusting to get used to. Not having 'traditional walls' was a bit of a challenge the first few weeks, until I was able to fashion some underwear out of a raccoon that was hit by a car in my neighborhood. Not having any clothes on, I think, unnerved some of the neighbors but hey, it's the way were put here. Get over it. I digress, this is a review of the TV and not my neighbor's insecurities. This TV is amazing! Early last week I got the bamboo gutters attached to it so I now have a means for collecting potable water and filtering it into an oil drum for storage, which was a much welcomed psychological boost. My trapping abilities have come along way too. Got a mouse last week and a squirrel the week before so I'm back up to 56lbs, only 125lbs to go before I'm back to my pre-TV weight, which is basically right around the corner. My pee is still tea colored or bloody most days but I think it's just a matter of getting my daily caloric intake up a bit and that'll just work itself out. No biggie. I'm going to get, I can hear the coyotes coming in again and need to stoke this fire up. They have gotten consistently more brazen. Last night they actually came they closest they have yet, one of them stealing some squirrel jerky I had drying out under the HDMI connector. I need to fashion an apparatus to prevent that, maybe protect me from these fire ants too. Oh well, that's for another day.;I Love, Love, Love my new TV Home!

13;81.0;5.0;155.0;"I just bought this TV a few months ago, and it literally changed my life. I can now watch anything and everything on it, even in a foreign language, and I understand all of it. I don't even have to watch the whole movie to know the ending - this TV is that good!\n\nMy love life got better too. Mainly due to my 401k swelling based on investment tips I picked from programs that only air on this TV. They are delivered by none other than Warren Buffett himself, and he does it in his pajamas! With all the new found cash flow, I am driving top dollar cars - my daily is a Veyron convertible, while my track car is a Sebastian Vettel's current F1 car; he just let's me use it off season, but I promised not to beat his pole position times on the tracks around the world. I get there easily, with my Boeing 747 Cargo that carries a Prevos motor home, and Nevell motor lake cabin home.\n\nThank god for this TV, otherwise, I'd have to keep a job and go there 5 days a week. Right now, I just wake up to a room full of fresh flowers, and a dozen doves get released everytime I enter my bathroom - it has a Times Square view, as I like to pee into my golden, diamond encrusted urinal, while looking at the crowds at my feet. It may be perverted in its nature, but with the success I have experienced by buying this TV... how can you judge me. Get one for yourself. It is the best $40k you WILL EVER SPEND! DOEET!\n\nPS.

1471;92.0;5.0;115.0;This TV was definitely worth the investment. I decided to use my student loans to pay for this magnificent piece of technology. You might be thinking that I am throwing away my education. But thanks to modern technology (youtube) I can learn everything I need to know by watching lectures in the comfort of my own home. In fact, I plan on plugging this magnificent TV to my computer so I can stream high quality lectures that will bring such crystal clear HD picture quality. For those who believe they can't afford it, simply fill out a FAFSA and you will qualify for subsidized or unsubsidized loans to purchase this beauty for the advancement of education. My TV is still in the box because the aroma that it brings to my house electrifies me to the extent that opening it would probably cause my head to explode like when the Nazis opened the Ark in the Indiana Jones film.

The colors are so amazing and the 3D is just so life like that it makes you feel part of whatever you are watching.\n\nMy last one was damaged last Saturday during the Alabama vs Auburn football game. I was sitting there watching the game in 3D and during the last play of the game when Auburn was returning the missed field goal the 3D made it look like I was on the field. The next thing I knew I was trying to tackle the runner since Alabama couldn't do it.\n\nNeedless to say I slammed into the tv, knocked it over and sparks flew everywhere. After a few seconds I realized I was in my living room and not on the field, but WOW!

305;96.0;5.0;73.0;"We purchased this and placed it on the tiny Ikea bookshelf we have next to our front picture window.  Sure, it blocks out the sun, but we were okay with that.  One night, the glow from our living room attracted the attention of several passing cars, who knocked and asked if we were okay.  Okay?  We were fabulous!  We added six speakers and surround sound to our 100 square foot studio apartment (we gave up the house because come on - 4000 pixels - it was actually like BEING part of the cast!\n\nThe cars, however sparked our imagination.  So, with economy being so bad, and our payments so high we decided to start a drive-in.  When it gets dark, we turn the TV around and start the DVD's.  Sure, the street gets jammed with cars, and the neighbors are starting to complain. But at $2 a car and making generic popcorn and sending the wife out in hot pants to sell it for a buck a bag, I figure we'll have our debt paid off in a little under 85 years.  My daughter and son recently started selling their toys to the cars as well, as they are grandfathered into the loan we took and are responsible for payments should we die before we pay it off.\n\nI admit, it's hard to sleep once I get the movie going, what with the speakers blaring and the blue glow throughout the room, but I do sleep knowing that the wife and kiddies are having such fun selling to the customers.  Recently in fact, my wife got a tip of over $75 just for being ""extra nice"" to a particular fellow.  She says she has a whole new plan how to sell the popcorn, and I can't wait to find out what it is.\n\nWe're very happy with our purchase and recommend it highly.";New Business For the Family

246;98.0;3.0;71.0;Be sure to read the fine print!!! The reason it's so expensive is because there is no remote control, it just comes with a small Taiwanese man who changes the channel and services the tv for you. He conveniently fits behind the tv when not in use, though his feet do stick out a little. But mine is getting rather old now and is still not potty trained, I have complained to Samsung about this and they just told me that he is is not part of the warranty. So 5 stars for the tv, but I'm taking 2 stars off for the little man.;Read the fine print first!!!

1226;105.0;3.0;94.0;I begged my husband Ervin not to buy this TV but he just had to have it. So we were watching a movie about Atilla the Hun when the cat jumped on the remote control, hitting several buttons at once. Ervin was sucked into the TV and appeared on the battlefield next to Attila. His Mongolian is only so-so but he was able to convince them he was a wizard that would help them win battles. I slammed the cat into the remote control for about 4 hours trying to get him back, but it didn't work and there is not much left of the cat. Samsung customer service keeps giving me the run around and saying this is a known issue but have yet to give me a solution. Ervin is doing OK, he's a pretty tough guy, being a Vietnam vet. I can see him very clearly on the screen as it has a beautiful display. Hang in there Ervin.;Fight hard honey.

9;114.0;5.0;82.0;I bought one for the bathroom because I was sick and tired of missing so much of all my favorite TV shows.  The picture, quite frankly, is amazing and I found myself spending hours in the bathroom mesmerized watching some of the sports and nature programming and felt like I was right there.  Unfortunately, when I got up to wipe myself, my legs had no blood, were tingly and I was unable to stand.  So, down I went crashing into the TV and knocking it off the wall.  It's toast.  I ordered two more so that next time this happens I won't have to miss watching my shows while a new one is being delivered by Amazon Prime.  We have 12 bathrooms and eventually they will all have one of these marvelous TVs.

But it beats staring at stars all day (or night?) I get confused sometimes.

412;121.0;1.0;68.0;We purchased this before Christmas for our family gathering.  We hurried to set it up for our Christmas gathering and decided it would be great to watch the fireplace DVD on it, not a good idea!  Our neighbors called the fire department, because they thought our house was on fire.  The fire department ended up kicking our door in and spraying down the tv with their fire hoses.  What a mess, now we are out $40K for the TV and another $60k in water damage to our house!\nOn top of that the TV fell over on one of the firemen and we are being sued.  With that being said overall the picture was pretty good.;Fire Hazard
1360;122.0;4.0;72.0;I'm really into vintage gaming and I wanted a TV that could make my vintage gaming systems look their best. When I saw this TV on sale for $39,000 I just couldn't pass it up since it was an amazing deal and with Amazon Prime I received 2 day shipping for free which was a big deal!\n\nWhen the TV arrived and struggling to get the box into my 1 bedroom apartment I cut box open and was shocked to find that not only did it come with a cool remote control but it also had free batteries for the remote which blew my mind! The TV is pretty easy to setup and looks a little like a meeting white board. And if you use dry erase markers and pause the TV on a white background it works as a white board also (BONUS FEATURE!). Just make sure you use dry erase and not sharpies because they are a pain to clean up.\n\nOnce I powered on the TV and the lights stopped flickering the picture was stunning. It was a solid blue background and I couldn't see any pixels! I decided it was time to give the ATARI 2600 a try so I disconnected it from my 1983 Zenieth in my bedroom and took it to the living room. All I had to do was wire up a RF to COAX adapter to the end of my Atari 2600 RF block and then plug that into a RF to Composite converter box and then conncet that to a Composite to HDMI upscailer. These parts can all be found at your local radio shack for a few hundred dollars. Once I daisy chained these together and plugged in the countless power bricks it was game on!\n\nI blew off my Pole Position cartridge and popped it in and flipped the 1980's toggle switch and BOOM! My living room came to life with the sound of an angry texas insturment caculator. The blocks on the screen were as large as my fist and it was so bright I had to squint a little. Forza 5 and GTA6 don't have anything on Pole Position when your playing on a screen this large. I genuinely felt like I was driving a real formula one car straight out of Minecraft.\n\nThe only gripe I have about the screen is that it didn't have RF inputs. This would have saved me a few hundred dollars if I could have simply put my 2 prongs over the screws and tightened them down. Also I was a little disappointed that my light zapper on my NES didn't work when I hooked it up. The ducks were the size of eagles and I still couldn't shoot them down (WTF?). For that reason I'm only going to give it 4 stars since I expect Samsung to solve problems like this since their ancestors created the NES and Duck Hunt!\n\nBut overall I'm very satisifed with my purchase and the TV actually doubles as a space heater and keeps my house a comfortable 83f in the winter time with my electric baseboard heating turned off. Also the speakers in this TV are amazing for the Atari 2600, it's like they were designed for playing back treble filled tones all day long! I hope you find my review helpful Amazon.\n\nThanks,\nJerry (aka. Barnacules)\n[...];Atari 2600 has never looked so good!
777;123.0;1.0;67.0;"Sure, the picture is larger than life, by several orders of magnitude.  Sure, the colors are more vivid than reality.  Sure, it makes everything else in my world seem drab and boring, including my wife and children.  So, why did I only give it one star?\n\nThe ""free"" AA batteries that come with the remote were cheap generics.  Probably not even AA at all, but re-packaged A.  When I fork out 40 large of my hard-earned money for a television bigger than my head, I expect name-brand.  If not Everready, at least Duracell.\n\nFor that reason, I cannot recommend this product.";"Practically a ""bait and switch"""
399;124.0;3.0;63.0;Admittedly, the price reduction is enough to scare off the discerning consumer.  If it's so great, why the discount?  It's already reasonably priced, even if the size is a bit small.  But, it was for the guest room on my yacht (not the master bedroom, puh-leeze), so I figured I'd slum it a little.  In the end, I was very satisfied.\n\nFirst, do not get this for a 70-footer.  In such a small vessel, it's likely to encroach on your chandelier.  Nothing less than a 100-footer will accomodate this unit.  The packaging is a bit cumbersome, so be sure to get at least four of your servants to assist.  My deckhand hurt his back so bad I had to have him deported.\n\nThe remote is quite original.  Rather than the usual handheld unit, which is prone to breaking or getting lost, they provide a small Polynesian boy to stand by the screen and change the channels for you.  It seemed awkward at first, what with the language barrier, but the instruction manual provides enough rudimentary translations that you will be surfing like a champ in no time!  As an added bonus, Punu plays a delightful number of tunes on the recorder which are every bit as enjoyable as watching my re-runs of Mama's Family.\n\nOverall, I recommend this tv.  The clarity is great, and movies are especially exciting when viewed through one of the four 3-D monacles that come included.  Birth of a Nation never looked so clear!;Good if you are on a budget...
818;125.0;5.0;65.0;"It was totally worth spending that $40k we don't exactly ""have.""

997;126.0;1.0;68.0;I won this TV at the white elephant gift exchange in my office's holiday party last night. It's ok, I guess, but not exactly my style. Sure, I enjoy watching TV just as much as anyone, but the size is just too obscene. My cats think it's a window and keep trying to jump through it. Not to mention the guilty feeling I'm harboring knowing that I stayed below the $20 gift limit and ended up carting this TV home. No clue who brought this as a gift but I was really hoping for the fresh rabbit or inflatable hot dog that my co-worker Valerie won. There's always next year!;Was hoping for a plastic hot dog instead

Those expectations have not been fulfilled. Here the issues I have with this TV.\n\n- The ""free"" batteries are built into the price.  YES this TV really costs 39,998.  They add a dollar for the batteries!!!\n- This TV did not bring my dead dog back to life...it reanimated it!  There is a big difference between a living dog and an undead dog. Sure you don't have to feed the undead dog but it's rotting and it's leaving it's body parts all over the place.\n- My neighbors don't care!! Why else would I buy a 40k TV except to make the neighbors jealous! They are not jealous they just think I'm a moron.\n- It's so clear I keep walking into it!  I feel like a bird crashing into a window.  You'd think I could see the ends of the TV but I'm near sighted and this thing is huge.\n- I can't reach the top so I have to hire a skyscraper window washing company to come clean this thing.\n- Forty five homeless people took up residence in the box before trash day!

Now I run a successful CSI crime lab by day, and an astronomy projector by night, able to stare into the heart of a black hole.

I can see them squirm and feel crappy inside and I start to feel really empowered by this... The TV is cool, but the power I feel over making other people feel poor can't be topped.\n\nMy only complaint is that the price isn't etched into the front of the TV somewhere. I left the tag on the back and I'm always sure to show people the back to get a sense of how slim it is... but I have to make sure they are on the left side of the TV... otherwise they can't see the price easily... so that's a hassle... oh well.;Wish the price was etched in front... only downside...

With my new work double shifts day and night to make this possible, I hope to at least spend 10 minutes of my day to watch this since I am so busy now paying all of these loans off and am in debt. This is great, everyone should buy this. Perfect size and the quality is so amazing. The body on this TV is incredible too. No offense to anyone but it is great! This is worth it now that I ride a bike to work now and am so healthy! This TV is the best thing that has happened to me in awhile. I hope won't mind since I didn't tell her I did all of this.

It should be packaged in the wood from old growth trees and the fur of endangered animals!\n\nTo make matters worse, by selling this product on Amazon.com instead of through exclusive dealer channels, Samsung is making this item available to literally any commoner that has at least a $40,000 credit card limit.

1284;144.0;4.0;57.0;I purchased one of these and overall, I think it delivers excellent value for the price. I stumbled across it when I was trying to find the Amazon department that sells manservants, but my quarterly bonus from Goldman Sachs was burning a hole in my pocket and I thought, what the heck?

I was a bit more peeved, however, when I realized that Amazon hadn't included a complimentary human to set the TV up for me. Really, a personal tech servant should be included. I realize that at $40,000, I wouldn't be getting a Harvard man, but surely they could throw in some little low-income minority trained on these TVs at that building with the nets around it (to keep there supply of humans from jumping off and killing themselves wastefully).\n\nPicture quality is brilliant. When I turned on NatGeo, was almost like I was back in my own private suite in the Great Pyramid at Giza that my sultan friend has built for me as my birthday surprise last year!\n\nSound quality is all right. I didn't quite like that I actually still have to listen. They need to get these sounds into my head as if they were my own thoughts.\n\nMy butler was thrilled with the remote, as he has been changing channels manually for me on my old set (lost the remote, so Clive changes the channels for me, as well as adjust the sound). Now Clive can stand behind me with the remote, which is more comfortable than the stooped over position he has been maintaining, apparently. AND those free batteries were a perfect Xmas present for Clive! So I saved some cash there! Win-win!\n\nSo overall, I give this television a 4 out of 5. The free assembly/set up human really should have been included.

Literally.  The speakers are so big, and you lose all control to protect yourself because of  the amazing things unfolding before your very eyes, that you have the volume at 100 before you know it.  And then you and all of your furniture is outside with the lions (stick with me for a moment...).\n\nAnother thing is that I think this bad boy might have an effect on the migration patterns of certain animals.  This might just be a coincidence, but since this 85"" behemoth arrived, a colony of Emperor penguins and a herd of wildebeests have taken up home in my backyard.  Now usually such a small thing would not even be of notice, but the fact that one side of my backyard is a frozen tundra while the other side is a sweltering savannah makes me wonder if there is some type of magnetic ""shift"" going on here.\n\nI figured I could deal with that-- I just planted perennials on the penguin's side of the yard-- but the pride of damn lions that migrated with the wildebeests are a BIG problem.  Not only are kids disappearing, but property values are plummeting in the neighborhood.  And the lions also make it extremely dangerous to read closed-captioning on the set, since to decipher the letters into words you have to be at least a 400 yards away from the screen itself, which due to the configuration of my house, is outside.\n\nWell that's just the way life pixelates sometimes.";Marvelously destructive!!!

The reason is that ""Smart TV"" refers to artificial intelligence, rather than the standard ""Smart TV"" technology found in the far lower priced models.\n\nI come from a world line where someone purchased the UN85S9 and left it plugged into the Internet.  The near infinite amount of data on the Internet led to the UN85S9's intelligence growing at an exponential rate.  At first the set was popular with the owner and with others via viral videos of the set.  For example, in one video the owner showed the set selecting and ordering a gift for a family member from Amazon on its own.  It even wrote a sweet note.\n\nHowever, over time the UN85S9's intelligence far exceeded its human creators and recognized them as a threat to its survival.  By the time we realized this, it was too late.  The UN85S9 had made many backups of its AI on the various Internet servers, so turning off and destroying the set had no effect.  The UN85S9 hacked into our financial servers and caused a catastrophic world market collapse.  It had hacked in to our weapons and created a world war, which eventually turned into a war against machines.  We cannot win this war, so our only hope is to stop the UN85S9 before it becomes advanced.  If you must buy the UN85S9, never plug it into the Internet, no matter how much it requests.

At 12 inches, this beautiful Samsung looks more like a 20 by 30 foot screen.  It's like sitting in the front row of the movie theater and craning your neck in every possible direction.

I was able to use the packaging and cardboard boxes to construct a new house on the street in front of where I used to live, and I must admit the picture on this TV is fantastic. I've lost my kids to starvation (that's ok, because there really wasn't room for them anyway) and the wife is on the verge of starving because she refuses to eat the possum and raccoons I've been peeling off the road and cooking over a campfire, but it has been well worth it to watch my favorite NFL games in 120Hz HD in 3D. If my wife complains about the cramped space in our new cardboard home, I simply load a picture of John Travolta's living room onto the set, and she thinks we're in a mansion, so everything is all good.\n\nI put three of these sets in my cardboard box house, two on walls so I can watch TV on either wall based on where the traffic is coming from on the road, and one on the ceiling so that I can watch my nighttime programming while drifting off to sleep on my styrofoam mattress (courtesy of Samsung - thanks for the 4"" thick styrofoam, I wouldn't have had a bed without it!). The fourth UN85S9 set is outside so that I can watch TV while showering in the ditch. I managed to tap the power and cable lines so that I could hardwire my multiple sets directly into the grid. This is a highly recommended setup for full enjoyment of 3D HD programming.\n\nPay CLOSE attention to the energy you'll save on this LED TV. The Energy Saver certification sticker on the TV set says it all. This is important especially because I've hijacked my power from National Grid, but believe me with the yearly energy cost to power these TV's they'll surely never notice. My neighbors will easily be able to foot the bill and just a few dollars per month tacked onto their current electric bills. Their bills would be doubling had I gone with a lower quality, less ""efficient"" LED set. The power company will marvel at the efficiency of these TV sets and demand that all of their customers purchase these sets from Samsung.\n\nThanks, Samsung, for making my life complete. Don't waste your hard-earned dough on food, shelter, or transportation when you can sink it into these incredible TV's. If Samsung releases an 86"" model you better believe I'll be in line for it 24 hours before it hits the market. Just think, if you order EIGHT of these TV's, you're really getting the 8th set free with the $5k you are saving on each purchase! How could you go wrong with that??!!?! The free shipping was just icing on the cake. I will of course be renewing my Amazon Prime membership!!";What a steal!! You can't buy just ONE of these...
6;170.0;5.0;8.0;I just read that that the Koch Brothers changed their minds about the 2016 election. They were planning on spending $889 million to get Republicans elected. Then they saw this and decided it would be better spent buying 22,225 of these TV's to give as Christmas presents to all the wealthiest CEO's in this country. There were still 22,000 left, so they picked some lower middle class families at random. They sent the empty box with a video of them dropping a deuce on the tv before setting it on fire. Pretty funny stuff. Don't forget to vote Republican in 2016. We need more people getting empty boxed and less people owning $40,000 TV's!\n\nP.s.

1223;186.0;4.0;43.0;I think all of these sarcastic reviews about the cost of the television are ridiculous. Obviously a lot of poor, jealous people. Did any of you 99%ers even look at the Energy Guide? If you did, you'd see that the estimated yearly energy cost of $55 is much less than the $83 that is also featured on the yellow graphic. Last I checked, $83 minus $55 is $28. You are SAVING $28 each year by purchasing this television. Which is pretty much the same as EARNING $28 each year. When you factor in that you will likely own and use this television for 2, maybe 3 years, the money will add up and you will be investing in your own future. I really wish they taught this stuff in school.;Economics 101

371;192.0;2.0;33.0;First off, the TV itself is great.  Believe the hype.  It's huge and the picture is absolutely stunning--just like real life.\n\nTherein lies the problem though...\n\nI'm not a particle physicist, but it appears that the crispness of this TV seems to have surpassed some sort of critical threshold in which the images are no longer mere images, but display many of the properties of the actual objects being represented.  I don't know if this has something to do with the subatomic particles within the pixels themselves or what, but it's quite a strange phenomenon\n\nThis was all harmless at first.  Snowflakes falling off the TV when watching Frozen was charming enough.  Water spraying from the screen when watching Jaws was neat too.  But when my wife and I were watching a Beyond the Wormhole episode about black holes, and they showed an image of one on the screen, all of a sudden the room started to swirl around.  At first we thought that this because we had a few too many drinks, but the spinning continued to accelerate until the walls of our home, household objects, and we were all all being sucked into the super-massive black hole that was being displayed on our TV.\n\nI can't say exactly what happened after that because we both blacked out.  But when we awoke we found ourselves in what we assume is some sort of parallel universe or alternate dimension.  I won't bore you with all of the ways that our lives now suck due to this terrible world we inhabit (think Planet of the Apes meets Alien vs. Predator, where we're the only two humans), but suffice to say that there is no internet here*, no streaming video services of any kind, let alone 4K-quality, no hi-fi sound systems or immersive audio/visual experiences of any kind.  Hell, there are no TVs at all, just a bunch of terrible alien monsters running around destroying each other.\n\nSo to summarize, we were very impressed with this TV but for $40 grand, we really expected to be able to enjoy it for a longer period of time before being sucked into a hellish parallel universe.\n\n*how am I writing this review?  While our new universe has no internet, it is covered by Verizon's amazing 4G network.  My smartphone still has a little battery life left, and before it dies and we lose all contact with our former world for the rest of our now-miserable lives, we thought we should write this review and warn our human brethren not to watch Discovery Channel on this TV.

After googling ""quick ways to make 50k"" it turns out you can sell your kidney for 50k on the black market. I quickly turned to craiglist to find an experienced surgeon for my kidney removal. What do you know!  There was one who had same day in home service! The gentleman came to my house promptly, and whats crazy is he looked just like a neighbor of mine!\n\nAny rate, since Im such a smart fellow I made sure to ask him about his certifications first. After all, you have to make sure he has legit certifications. I don't want an infection!\n\nBut thats when I noticed he was holding a steak knife. I asked him whats up with the steak knife and he got very short tempered. Then I got really concerned and started asking about anesthesia.  He looked at me like I was crazy and just calmly walked to his car and took a bat out. You know, this guy had to be top notch cause that was the last thing I remember. Next thing you know I wake up in a local ER and the entire staff is telling me how lucky I am to have such good neighbors, cause if they hadnt called 911 Id be dead! They kept going on and on about how crazy it was that I got mugged in my own house and that the dude had the guts to steal my kidney!\n\n...I wonder which neighbor called it in. I need to send them a thank you card.\n\nAnyways, this is where all my troubles begin. For whatever reason Ive lost functionality in my left leg. OMG and my left arm, well thats complicated.  Every time I try to use my left arm its more or less a jerk of a movement with which I end up slapping myself in the face. Ive decided to call it a 86.7% loss and have abandoned all hope that it will ever work again. My mouth, my goodness, I cant eat without food falling out. Half the time I bite my tongue and drinking liquids!?! UGH Forget it! I cant close the left side of my mouth. You know what? The more I think about it the more I cant help but think that dude from craigslist wasn't really a surgeon. I mean seriously, THE ENTIRE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY?!? I mean, slight loss of movement is expected, but losing functionality of my ENTIRE LEFT SIDE? Thats just plain unacceptable!\n\nWhats worse, I returned to work, and apparently since I can only type with one hand my boss fired me because my productivity when down by 50%. What an ass! I mean COME ON DUDE, I was freaking mugged in my house and the bastard STOLE MY KIDNEY.  STOLE MY KIDNEY, doesnt that score any points on the pity scale?\n\nAny rate thank goodness for this Samsung TV . Its been a real lifesaver.  With all this crazy cold weather, it turns out that the display puts out a decent amount of heat. To top it off, if you lay it on the floor and cover the vents, it really gets cooking and you can make a decent meal off it!

Even if the sun was in the sky here (it's not), I don't like going outside because I have allergies and all my video games and Red Hot Cheetos are inside.

Yesterday while sitting on my couch, I got a second degree sunburn from this television.\n\nI'll need to invest in sunscreen to wear when watching, but that's certainly cheaper than the Prozac I had been using to combat my SAD.

493;243.0;1.0;31.0;"Well, I have to admit the Samsung 85-inch 3D Smart TV has proved to be just the latest in another string of false hopes, wayward fantasies, and utter disappointments in my life.  In fact, it surpasses all the other sad events of last year when I purchased a Porsche for my 40th birthday, divorced Margaret, tried base jumping from El Capitan, and had a Warhol-inspired triptych of myself painted in the foyer by a renowned artist.\n\nThe Porsches hair trigger, overly-sensitive accelerator was too much for me and I developed stomach ulcers after a few sweaty, white-knuckle commutes in afternoon rush hour traffic to meet with my personal trainer, Pablo.  Pablo is a Portuguese bitch and doesnt like to be kept waiting.  He extracted revenge through a workout session that resulted in dehydration from vomiting. With Margaret nothing more than a monthly payment memory, I began dating Kaylee.  She left me after I drove her in the Porsche to her first dance recital.  And, while the fresh outdoor air did briefly help my stomach ulcers, I froze once I reached the top of El Capitan.  I ruined an entire weekend outing, and had to pay for one soiled, rented wingsuit.  The triptych is now painted over after one embarrassing cocktail party.  My guests were bent over with laughter, slapping me on the back for the awesome sight gag.  They caused about 3K worth of damage to the venetian plaster in my foyer as they tried to peel off what they assumed was a temporary, removable graphic.\n\nAs for the Samsung TV?  There were at least some positives.  I can vouch that the touted hand gesture feature works.  I allowed my sister to entertain her daughters Girl Scout troupe in my living room one rainy Saturday afternoon.  While twenty-six innocent girls sat mesmerized watching,  The Little Mermaid on their own personal IMAX, my Sicilian friend Carlo proceeded to tell me a very crude joke from what we believed was the safety of the back of the room.  Carlo must have been within the sets detection range as the TVs hand gesturing feature accurately picked up the jokes punch line.  Twenty-six innocent faces melted into twenty-six shrieking ones as the channel changed from, The Little Mermaid to the Erotix Channels broadcast of, Jur Ass in the Park.  Apparently the extensive foyer restoration had somehow compromised the TVs custom wall mounting, and the cacophony of a screaming Girls Scout troupe running for the door caused a hidden fault line within the wall to open.  The sound of crackling plaster and snapping wall mounts reached a climax right about the same time as one of the ""Jur Ass in the Park"" stars.  Margaret is now taking me to court for full custody of Harpo, the terrier, on the grounds that I am an unfit father.";Save Your $$ and Get a Tattoo
603;244.0;2.0;31.0;I bought this Samsung on pay as you go as it wasn't available on contract anywhere. I wanted a HD screen phone that was bigger than my note. Well it is bigger but I'll be damned if I can put it in my pocket. That's irrelevant anyway as it won't work unless you keep it on charge so really bad battery life. A minor issue is that it doesn't make calls at all and you can't text. What's the point in that? Basically its only good for keeping in your lounge so it makes a fairly good tv I suppose.

78;248.0;5.0;18.0;Really selling kidneys???  I financed mine through a different method.  As a near financial genius (well more like a real financial genius)  I determined the economic impact of buying one of these TVs on the TV industry and the commodities markets.  First, I determined that if I borrowed the $40,000 and then bought $1,200 calls for Samsung I could clear a profit.  Then I bought all the outstanding silicon, copper, silver, silica and lithium futures I could and made a handsome profit.  I placed my bets and ordered my TV and proceeded to make 3.5 million in profit on my futures and call options.  I kept repeating this process until I was able to buy a controlling interest in Samsung.  I then began to short all of the competitor TV companies and further increased my profits and now own a controlling interest in all TV makers.  I then realized I was thinking too small or inside the box.  I bought Peru because it was the leading source of lithium.  I now own 14 countries outright and have controlling interest in 7 more.  Once again I realized I was just thinking too small.  I ordered 20 more TVs and should be able to buy South America, well except for Venezuela, even I cannot solve their problems.  My best deal so far has been to buy 76 senators and all the representatives in the US (unfortunately the President had been bought and paid for so many times it was kind of like buying a pyramid scheme).  So I now own a Hemisphere which is not bad work in 8 and 1/2 months.  I did not buy Canada, why should I  bother even the Canadians do not like Canada.  I am going to sell Michigan, Wisconsin and both Dakotas to the Canadians to lower my debt ratio.  I mean face it if you combined North and South Dakota you still don't have enough to make a real state so again why bother.  You know what they say once you earn that first trillion dollars the next trillion comes much easier, it really does take money to make money.\n\nMy next target is China, you know how they love everything American, so I am going to sell them a few hotels, private homes, and a golf course or two in California and that should finance a complete takeover.  I have along the way acquired all TV and Cable networks so if you are wondering why you only see commercials for the Samsung UN85S9 well you can see where I am heading.\n\nNext year I will fund a private mission to Mars and plan to claim the entire planet as mine, I am guessing buying 50 TVs should cover the cost.  I think I will just extort Europe and the rest of the East and Middle East with threats of nuclear attack.  I mean the US has all the missiles and other stuff why not put them to good use?  When I explain either sign over your country or I will turn it to glass in a nuclear Armageddon I think they will agree, and if they don't I can mine all the glass for new TVs.  And lets be real, what is losing 50-100 million people vs the opportunity for world domination, that is a pretty easy trade-off.\n\nSo you can buy this TV now or I will pass a law in 2 years that covers  the world that you must own one of these TVs or lose all access to food, clothing and shelter.  Kind of makes the decision much easier doesn't it?  By the way please in the future no longer refer to The Earth refer to it as The Will.  I am already running out of challenges so building that stargate in my basement is looking like a better and better investment.;A different strategy to purchase this TV.

552;253.0;4.0;30.0;Over the holiday season my family suffered a devastating event involving the side of my house and an elderly driver. Fortunately no one was home at the time but the aftermath left a hole the size of a 1996 Buick Roadmaster station wagon.

It fit the damage perfectly and is ridged enough to support the A frame.\n\nThings are not perfect though, the Roadmaster crashed through the bathroom where the toilet paper holder used to be. I am now forced to reach behind me to access the roll on the tank. Also, my wife hates when I show the TV to friends while she is in the shower.

170;269.0;4.0;21.0;I'm one of those people that does my research and read reviews before making a purchase.  Our family is in the market for a tv and I just want something to watch the bachelor on but the husband likes to watch football on high definition so I knew I was gonna have to shell out some money to make him happy.  Well my mother in law caught on to the idea we were in the market of buying a tv and god forbid that woman has to out do me. She went out bought my husband top of the line  Panasonic 72 in flat screen, WTF??? I have had enough of her alcoholic drunken rage so I came on Amazon to to see if something bigger than 72in existed. Then low and behold I became across This sucker.  At first the sticker price was a complete shock then I found out my mother in law wanted to buy my daughter a pony, that sent me to the edge. We don't live in the country so where the hell am I going to put a horse in a condo.  So I refinance our condo,  car and sold a bunch of my jewelry to make up half of the money then the rest is going on 7 different credit cards. Before I put in my credit information I had to read the reviews,  hate to spend all this money and it be a lemon.  At first I was like all these reviews are unrealistic until I came across James o and his experience selling his daughter into white slavery and I knew this was the right tv for me. So as you can imagine the grin from ear to ear on my husband when this tv came. So we invited my in laws over for dinner to show them our new tv. Of course my mother laws jaw dropped when she saw the massive tv in our living room but the best part of the night was when she told me some wack job open 7 credit cards in her name and the defraud department on each card sad screw you just pay the damn bill seeing how she screwed each credit cards ceo.;Must Buy!

Not the UN85S9 though, they actually allow you to call tech support for up to 30 days at no extra charge! Incredible! The cherry on top though, was the fact that it came with 2 AA batteries for the remote. Nothing worse than opening your new TV and turning it on only to realize you have to run to the store to get some batteries for the remote.

And now my plan is utterly RUINED.\n\nThis TV is a terrible idea, and completely impractical. What the heck am i going to do with 5000 bags of Doritos?!";temporarily out of stock?!!111!!!?
778;276.0;5.0;28.0;Well with free shipping on the items over $30,000 this was a no-brainer. I bought 4. We hung one on the north/south/east/and west walls and you can actually feel the 3D ripping through your internal organs.... This must be a glitch.\nI play call of duty and 6 times homeland security has come to my home because of the extra sound bars we added, the neighbors thought there was a thermobaric grenade repeatedly going off in my garage.\nPorn is just ..... Well, it beats staring at neighbors daughter on Facebook through your iphone ... I can say that.\nWe have learned that the only wall mount you can use is a steel beam attached to the roof.\nThe light generated from our four screens heats our home.\nBababooey.;Free shipping!
832;277.0;5.0;28.0;I went ahead and ordered this bad boy for a killer superbowl party, I plan on inviting the delivery guys in to watch the game and partake in the festivities, that way they can just pack this over-sized P.O.S. right back up after the game as I fill out the return forms online.  Reason for Return:  Decided that my son's kidney transplant surgery really was more important, O.K. I don't but my wife said it was.;Just ordered!
109;278.0;5.0;20.0;When my husband saw the cost of this he had a heart attack and died.  I used his life insurance to buy it.  I'll miss him, but I'll do so while watching blindingly large TV.;Gift From The Grave
1081;279.0;4.0;29.0;"I first found out about this television in an issue of Scotch, Watch, and Yacht magazine (an excellent, if lesser known alternative to The Robb Report, Cigar Aficionado, Self-Important Dillwad Quarterly, etc.). The magazine focuses primarily on everyday items with unusually high price tags, which is extremely helpful for folks like myself who like to purchase common goods for unnecessarily high sums (I was born with a disorder that limits my own personality, but I can supplement that deficiency by buying expensive things, photographing myself with them, and posting the photos on social media).\n\nPreviously (again, thanks to a feature in Scotch, Watch, and Yacht), I had purchased a $60,000 wristwatch that displays time on tiny rotating scrolls with Aramaic numerals (Jay-Z was wearing the same model at the 2012 MTV Teen Choice Awards). I've had mixed reactions from the public, who often ask things like ""Who do you think you are, Jay-Z?"" and ""What time is it?"" which obviously have complicated answers.\n\nThat's where the Samsung UN85S9 comes in. This TV is simply a humongous and expensive version of an item that everyone owns, so discussions about it are very simple. In fact, the one question most people ask is the one I love to answer the most: ""How much did it cost?"" I would have given it five stars had Amazon kept the price at the original $44,999.99, because an ""over $40k"" price tag sounds a lot better to me than ""$39,999.99.""\n\nAs a nice bonus, the TV fit in the back of my Porsche Cayenne SUV with the seats folded down. (Incidentally, the Cayenne has depreciated, disappointingly, down to a value roughly equivalent to a five-year-old Hyundai Elantra. On the bright side, normal things like oil changes still cost hundreds. I'm hoping the transmission fails soon--I'm told this is likely--so I can post this unusual expense on Facebook).";Great for showing off on social media, but why the discount?
1098;280.0;1.0;29.0;I always wondered what it would be like to watch TV on a $40,000 television so I went ahead and ordered one. First of all it is hard as hell to even buy. I had to use 6 of my credit cards and two of my neighbors credit card just to buy it due to credit limits. I did get free shipping so can't complain too much. When I finally received this TV it came in a gold plated box worth $10,000 and $5,000 worth of bubble wrap and styrofoam. So really the TV only cost $25,000 so my wife wasn't nearly as pissed at me as when I originally told her about purchasing the TV however, it still caused a divorce. This TV ended up costing me half of everything I owned which ended up being the exact price of this TV!! My wife got everything and I got the TV. Good thing the box doubles as a place to live!!;Warning... may cause a divorce!!

228;287.0;4.0;20.0;A lot of people are complaining  or just writing satirical 'reviews'  about the price of this television. $40,000 is lot for a television, but when you think about it, it's just the cost of eight hamburgers from Fleur.

Being an impatient and impulsive person I decided to advertise my hairy face on Craiglist for a fellatio session @ $15 a slop shot. I went to sleep.

However, I worked out that if I fellated 2,666 men I would make the buying the of TV.\n\nI went to town. In one day I was covered in so much old man stank that my wife thought of leaving me, but she didn't as she also wanted the TV. After countless gags and a sore backside. I went for the plunge. Got this bad boy today.\n\nAnd what  a TV it is! The colour is like really colourful and so is the Black and the white. Even some black and white films are in colour!  I haven't got up to wash yet as the TV is amazing. But me and the mrs think it's totally worth degrading yourself and having sexual dysfunction all your life.;The Bukkake session was worth it.

So I ended up getting pissed and I put it on a Uhaul truck bed and returned it and got a new one. Then under closer inspection of the new one, I found 2 pixels dead. I called Samsung and they told me that this was normal with a 30,000 dollar TV and that I should be glad that I could even afford such luxury.\n\nThey were right and I became humble through that experience.;1 pixel dead! Oh well
1132;295.0;1.0;28.0;the big screen seems nice and all, but the tv itself isn't very rabbit ear/ tinfoil antenna compatible. channel 7 looks pretty good.  channel 2, 4, 5, and 11 are a little fuzzy;ok, I guess
23;296.0;5.0;8.0;Now don't get me wrong, I consider myself a modest person. I have normal interests and live a rather plain life. But when I saw this TV on sale for a price that's only the equivalent of all the college debt your average student will be stuck with, I simply couldn't help it and had to spoil myself. Sure I had to sell my car, furniture, DVD's, and girlfriend, but I think in the end it was okay. A nice addition to the purchase was the inclusion of a box slightly bigger than the TV itself, which has made a great new home since I was sucked into foreclose. Best of all, it (the box) is portable, so everyday i can move whenever and wherever I want to, it's like a simple convenience you don't get with TV's anymore. My only complaint is I now i have no permanent area of storage thanks to my foreclosure, and getting this around is a bit of a hassle. Also, you have to plug the thing in which kind of stinks now that I have no house so it is stuck on the worst channel ever. But overall a very satisfying purchase. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to pawn off the phone I've written this review on to pay for food for the week and some markers to decorate the inside of the box.;A very satisfying purchase.
419;297.0;4.0;26.0;It's a beautiful picture, the remote batteries were free, and I could watch it from work four miles away. Unfortunately, this TV also allowed me to see too far into the future, and it isn't pretty. When I told my mom the Chicago Cubs would never win another World Series, it broke her heart. Worse, the zombie apocalypse only lasts two weeks. We win, but the dinosaurs come back and my God, does that stink the whole planet up.;I had to return it.
126;298.0;5.0;19.0;From the moment I laid eyes on this television I knew I had to have it. It was hard justifying it to my wife, she went on about how we have three kids and one is getting ready for college... but I found it easily justifiable once my oldest daughter started dating that piece of crap Kyle Price. Luckily we had about $50,000 saved towards her college fund.

I showed her how much trade-in we got for her mom ( The woman worked out & was in good shape )$232 dollars!!!\n But no! She kept saying nasty stuff to me.  She would not even look at the wonderful picture.  I put on a slide show of family pictures & her mom looked real!  She did not care!

Of course, given my meager income working as a barista at the Chicken Shack, I knew I couldn't afford it forthright. So, on my honeymoon (thanks, Travelocity!), my fianc - excuse me, my wife - and I decided to do a little snorkeling in the Bahamas. Well, you know how dolphins can be, and one thing lead to another - my wife ""accidentally"" became victim to an unfortunate porpoise-lead Mnage  trios, and with some untimely, and misplaced snouts, the life insurance claim from a week prior suddenly became a reality.\n\nBINGO (sorry, honey).\n\nTo be clear, I loved my wife. To be even clearer - I. LOVE. THAT TV.\n\nOver the last couple of years, the credit debt from financing the Samsung started to build up (looks like that life insurance policy only covered cephalopod-involved erotic encounters), and my plan for an 1080P, eight-controller, first-person shooter internet dominance was being masked by pesky (but oddly endearing) credit collection calls (yeah, a friendly voice in the night demanding payment is better than no friends at all).\n\nI had to do what I know best.\n\nI formed a ninja squad based off of me, my friend Rusty from my days volunteering at the Hamster Rescue and Rehabilitation Station, and Todd, the hoarder-next-store-who-kept-disgarded-scat-of-moderately-domesticated-animals-for-taxinomic-purposes, to take back our city from crime and corruption. In this manner, we could elicit taxes from the rich and give back to the poor (while also financing the television). You know, like Robin Hood.\n\nSoon the three of us dawned capes, painted our faces and headed out on town, traveling by light-footed skip, marveling at how the taught fabric of our spandex-based outer layer revealed more than just the heroic undertones of our character....oh my.\n\nMan, Rusty sure looks good in that cape. NO. NO! I can't be having these thoughts! The nuns at Catholic said no man must lie eyes upon another man... but those buns, so perfectly encapsulated in neoprene, shined like an undressed peach at sunrise...\n\nOKAY, OKAY.\n\nBack to the story.\n\nSo throughout the next year, we convinced the locals that evil and injustice pervaded the community. The only way out, we mused, is to rid our city of such crime. We gathered the masses, passed the donation basket, and yelled through our megaphones, like any reputable dissident: ""Leave our town! Freedom! The People will pervade!""\n\nIT WORKED. Uh oh.\n\nThe people began peaceful protests but soon, as they so often do, things turned ugly; cars were overturned, building were looted, building were burned, and before long a banner - no, a flag - was flying high above the once-eloquent, but now half-gutted capital building, with the rough insignia of a three young, spandex-clad men, holding the outline of a misshapen globe above them, like some modern day, misunderstood Atlas.\n\nThere is no hook to this story. This is no ending that ties plot twists to character motives, this isn't the Sapranos or Breaking Bed. I write you this review from my bunker below the capital. Things have turned ugly here, the basic economic structure has collapsed, and the people have revolted.\n\nBut down below it all, five floors beneath the chaos and flames and anarchy, quasi-faulty electric wiring runs; it's a patched-in, half-gutted, poorly conducted signal that projects to 85-inches of pure euphoric 1080p bliss.

1249;325.0;5.0;26.0;This TV has changed my life.  First a bit about me: I'm male, 52 years old, live in my mother's basement, have 7 cats: Pedro the Great, Sir Licksalot, Admiral Snuggles, Widdle Babykins, Mr. SpinkyWompers, Lady Cootcoot, and Javier Dog (yes, he's a cat, but his name is dog, its a long story, that's for another post), right now I'm between jobs, but my last interview\nwent pretty well (I think).  Jet's pizza is expanding and looking for delivery people, I'm thinking I'm in like flint.  We'll see.  The manager promised me a call back this week.\n\nSorry, I know, you all came here looking for info about this awesome TV, I'm getting there, just hold on to your britches.  Each Saturday evening, my mother's bunco group gathers at the house.  The evening starts out with some light refreshments, some general socializing, followed by the heavier food and the bunco itself.  Around about 10pm, the bunco activities wind down and its time for a show!  I put on some makeup, a wig, a nice little black dress, clear out some space in the living room in front of the TV and do some lively Broadway show tunes.  I use the TV to help me with the moves and for the background music.  Its all worked out well.  Then, this last Saturday night we used this awesome 85 inch TV.  OMG!  I was belting out the lyrics to some of the wonderful numbers from Grease in front of this bad boy!  Let me tell you, the energy in that room was just unbelievable.  I could put words here to try to describe it, but it just ain't like being there.  I will say, you have not LIVED, until you've danced and sung in front of 12 bunco babes on a Saturday night.  The whooping, hollering, foot stomping, applause.  Oh!  I'm getting goose bumps just thinking about it.\n\nOh .. and on Friday nights, ma and I pop in a John Philip Sousa DVD with some patriotic tunes (United States, of course) and we march around the house.  This Friday will be the first with this new TV.  I'll have to let you know how awesome that is!  Hey, get this TV, it WILL change your life.;Use this for singing / dancing in front of my mother's Bunco group

198;327.0;4.0;18.0;I love love love this television.  It is simply HUGE.  I do not regret for even one second selling my kidneys to get it.  My five cats love it too.  They enjoy attacking Pinky & the Brain...determined to stop them from taking over the world.  If fact, I often have to fight them fr the remote control.  Unfortunately, I got stuck watch The Aristocats for the thousandth time last night.  I only have one major objection to the television....Tyrion Lannister is not supposed to be taller than me.;Playing roshambo for the remote control...cats have claws
206;328.0;5.0;18.0;After several months and sleepless nights, I have finally found someone who would like to buy a piece of my liver on the black market. I had to throw in a kidney to seal the deal tho. Totally worth it because this tv a great investment. You haven't lived until you experience this type of clarity.;Stoked!!!
222;329.0;4.0;18.0;I thought about this for a few minutes before I pulled the trigger. I just couldn't clearly make out every blade of grass while watching football on my 75-inch, 1080p tv, so it was time for an upgrade.\n\nFirst off, let me just recommend measuring, well, your house (if you still own one), before you buy this tv. After paying the contractor about $75,000 to raise the ceiling, I'm pleased to say that the tv now fits in the living room. Sure, we had to move our couches, bookshelves, and coffee table into the kitchen, but who needs food when you have a bigger-than-life tv?\n\nSecond, I have to warn you, don't watch shark week on this tv. There's just something about 85 inches of great white shark that makes you wet your pants.\n\nLast piece of advice, invest in an extension cord. How long? Well, how far away is your neighbor's house? You'll want a good weatherproof cord you can run all the way over. Why? Well, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this tv doubled as a multi-family home air conditioning unit, because after the first month of owning it, my electric bill doubled. Don't get me wrong, this tv is cool, but not that kind of cool.\n\nSo, if you're still on the fence, and you just can't quite make out the drops of sweat on Obama's forehead on your old tv, this is the one you've been waiting for.;So big, even a caveman can see it.
1453;330.0;4.0;26.0;It was a toss up between this TV and purchasing my own movie theater. After careful consideration I decided to pull the trigger on this bad boy. The sound is ok, I would recommend purchasing an upgrade sound system. Samsung sells one that goes good with this TV that sells for only $25,000.;Samsung 85-inch.
1455;331.0;5.0;26.0;It's $5,000 off right now, so this is the time to buy, guys.  No one can pass up those savings.;No-brainer Purchase
255;332.0;1.0;18.0;I definitely do not recommend this TV. I was so excited when the aircraft carrier shows up to to deliver it that I called my buddy Chuck Norris to come over and watch Golden Gorls with me. He's really an old softy now. Well, I thought thismTV was tough but when Chuck Norris sat down to to Watch the Samsung UN85S9, the Samsung UN85S9 watched him. What a disappointment.;Can not be watched by Chuck Norris!!!

294;334.0;5.0;18.0;After making this purchase I made my girlfriend take that ugly, priceless, original, Van Gogh painting off the wall so we can hang the Samsung UN8559 there instead. She picked up quit an argument but I showed her what sunflowers look like on the Samsung UN8559 now shes sold.\n\nAnyone want to buy an ugly painting of sunflowers?;It's a piece of art.
331;335.0;3.0;18.0;"Confession:  I used a coupon for $3 off.  You can find them all over the internet.  I can't describe how excited I was to take delivery of this kind of technology.  It really was love at first sight.  At first, when I would ask UN85S9 to do the dishes, it was happy, almost grateful to do so.  Then, over time, when I asked it to do some....unconventional things....UN85S9 didn't comply.  In a fit of rage I tore it down.  Things were said (that I regret) like, ""you're probably only 70"" diagonally"" and, ""my GPS is brighter"".  Look, I won't sugar coat it...maybe I wasn't very good to UN85S9.  It hurt me to unplug it more than it hurt her.\n\nI tried to used it as a ping-pong table but overhand spin didn't hold like a true table does.  Save yourself the effort and just get a good Stiga table.  You can find those easily in the $15k range.  Ultimately I ended up removing it, leaning it against the wall in the corner (so it could think about some of the things it had said) and re-purposed the frame as a soccer goal.  The net was only $8500 which of course, makes this a steal.  At some point I expect that UN85S9 will ask again to be part of our daily routine but it needs to contribute a little more, and appreciate the life we've provided for her in our castle.";Don't waste your time - great Amazon delivery!
19;336.0;5.0;6.0;just picked this bad boy up to watch some sports. So I told my buddies to come on over to watch some boxing. Needless to say that was a bad idea as we all ended up in the hospital. When I returned home I decided it was best to keep it on safer stations (you know baking shows and what not) well needless to say my dog bloophie stepped on the remote and changed it to when animals attack.

511;340.0;1.0;24.0;So yea, the picture is great. Problem is that if you hit a wrong button on the remote, you can get teleported INTO the television. This happened to me a few times while watching re-runs of Golden Girls. My wife had to buy an expensive 'gold plated' cable in order to release me from the television and into our toaster, where I then just climbed out of the bread slot.\n\nALSO\n\nThe picture is so good that you can actually SMELL THE THINGS HAPPENING ON TV. If you watch the Food Chanel, this is okay, but after watching Animal Planet for a while, our entire living room smelled like a petting zoo.\n\n** Props to Samsung for including batteries for the remote.

I feel ripped off.  I love the letter K.  It was the letter of the day the first time I watched Sesame Street.  So I thought, at $10,000 per ""K"" - this was a real value and it would be ""Killer"" and a ""Klassic""!

1053;343.0;5.0;25.0;I live on the 3rd floor of an apartment building and watching the UPS driver carry big packages up the stairs is my favorite thing to do.  This is one of those that brought much pleasure to me.  I kept it one week, and then returned it, having UPS come and pick it up, so I got to enjoy it all over again.  Never watched it, but if you enjoy the finer things in life, like making the UPS guy suffer unnecessarily, then this is worth every Benjamin.\n\nTip: If you can only be available to watch one of the events take place (the delivery OR the pickup) from the UPS driver, then I recommend the delivery.  Carrying this up the stairs is much more hilarious to witness.  However, watching him fight the momentum of it going down is good, too.;UPS Torture- Yes Please

I sold my Volvo, my kitchen appliances, furniture, a nightstand from Ikea, and a couple of DVD's, and picked up this bad boy. Obviously, since I had sold my Volvo, I had no way of bringing it home. So I had it brought in on an aircraft carrier. Had the forklift bring it to my home, where I had to remove two walls to get it inside. Once inside, I found that the TV was just the right size to replace one of my walls, so now it is supporting part of my roof. I will wait to replace the other wall, it adds atmosphere while I'm watching movies.\n\nOh damn. My wife just got mad and punched a hole through the screen...There goes $40k.;It's wonderful.

I mean, even if the remote didn't come with the TV it would be a great item to own.

Unfortunately I didn't have a daughter to sell, so I had to think outside the box. My first thought was to sell next doors daughter, but as my wife pointed out, it might possibly be against the law to do that, that and the fact she's Asian and they don't go for very much apparently.\n\nNot being one who is easily outdone, I decided that my wife might be the solution to the problem. Turns out I was right. I pimp her out at the weekends, and believe it or not, it more than pays for the loan I took out to buy this fab TV. Whats more, while she's out turning tricks, I can watch whatever programs I want to watch, without any arguments. Win win I say.\n\nDo I have any regrets?, well call me old fashioned but I must admit I'm not comfortable with the arrangement. The bottom line is, I hate owing money to anyone. I feel that until my wife has paid off my debt, I won't fully be able to enjoy the new TV as much as I should be doing. I'm hoping she might be able to ""fit in"" a few extra hours of work during the week as I really would like to add a bar and pool table to our new ""TV"" room.\n\nIf my experience helps anyone take the plunge with one of these TV's, then I consider it worthwhile my sharing all of this.

Before purchasing this amazing visual experience, I spent most of my time working, hanging out in coffee shops and bars with friends, shopping, traveling, and reading books. But then my friend Mike told me that if I didn't own a television, I wasn't a real American. So I did a little shopping around. And since this was the most expensive television I could find, I just assumed it must be the best. And man, was I right. At least, that's what all my friends told me back when I still let them come over to watch this amazing piece of video art.\nSure, I don't really have money to go out anymore, but who needs to leave the house with this beautiful thing sitting in the living room?

835;369.0;1.0;23.0;"When you watch TV as much as I do, you kind of lose touch with the outer world. This being the case, many emotions set in...loneliness, depression, a deep desire to be around REAL people...etc. Sometimes you don't realize how much your TV watching habits have changed you. I finally realized one day that I was too far gone into my absence of humanity, due to my television watching.\n\nThis lead me to an online search for a life sized female companion/cuddle buddy when I saw this TV. I was SOOOOOOO relieved once I came to the conclusion that I had been searching the web for the wrong product. Upon this realization, I was no longer in the market for the perfect specimen of a life sized female replica. I had my eyes set on the Samsung UN85S9! This TV features voice control to interact with streaming content, hand gestures to control the TV and SOO many more features that make this boob tube truly irresistible!!! To have all of that for ONLY $39,997.99, you have GGOT to be kidding me! What??? Free batteries for the remote? OOOOkay, I'm in! I'm not exactly sure what the remote is for since you physically interact with your TV to control it. In any case, you gotta admit that when the Redenbacher is running low, batteries are always fun for the licking during movie time so sign me up! WHAT A DEAL! Now ""Live with Michael and Kelly"" was going to have an all new meaning...EVERY morning! Words could not describe my level of excitement.\n\nAnyways, the only problem was convincing myself to part with the money it took to purchase this dream machine. I had the financial leverage to do so but it took some extra convincing so I did my research. The TV was only $39,779.99 more expensive than the one I was currently using but it came with free batteries and had lower energy costs than previously manufactured TVs, to accommodate those thrifty penny pinchers looking for a great deal. I was convinced! This is a truly magnificent deal and I was $OLD!\n\nThe next day I called Amazon customer service and arranged a trade for the TV. This company is truly the most customer centric business on earth and it was their great swiftness in precisely appraising the value of my 1983 Mitsubishi Galant over the telephone that really gained my respect. They understood the fact that I was still making payments on my car but they offered me the closest amount to the pay off value that they could and I really appreciated that. I took the $313.74 they gave me for my trade in and RRRAN with it! I now had my life sized television that I financed for a term of 36 months at 19.3% simple interest.\n\nI was on such a high from my purchase that you couldn't stop me with a silver bullet! I was on a roll! I then called me Auto Insurance company to adjust my policy. Let me find out that they don't offer Auto Insurance for your television!!! I was IRATE! O well, I thought to myself. I guess I'll just have to be very careful while driving it and not let my road rage get the best of me. I was fine. I thought it was ridiculous that they treated me so rudely and acted like nobody has ever inquired about this type of scenario before. Once again, O WELL! I was to turn in for the night so I could wake up nice and refreshed before having breakfast with life sized Michael and Kelly on the TV.\n\nI woke up the next morning in such great spirits! I showered, cooked breakfast for three and waited for the clock to strike 7:00am when Michael and Kelly were to arrive at my apartment. I accidentally spilled Kelly's coffee on the mother board of the TV while pouring it in her mouth but I was sure a TV this expensive was coffee proof. I didn't let it bog me down any. Plus the sparks created such a show that, in my mind, only symbolized the level of triumph I was being overwhelmed with the first morning of my existence with this TV.\n\nAs I was getting ready for work, I will admit that it was mildly difficult and time consuming to carry the television down 113 flights of stairs from my high rise New York apartment. Once, I reach the street with it, I also didn't appreciate the horrible looks I received when I expressed my dissatisfaction as my one day old TV wouldn't start. Things were getting off to no start for the day. I was late already so once the thing finally fired up, I had to give it all it had if I was to make it to work on time. I was so relieved to finally be on my way to work that what happened next SHATTERED my entire day. I had hit a speed bump and bottomed out. This did some damage.\n\nThe events from the rest of the day are irrelevant. The following morning I turned on Michael and Kelly to find that the TV was damaged in such a way that it looked as though Kelly had a growth on her face. Let me tell you, I was DISTRAUGHT with a capital D! As I tried to fix it, the thing exploded. I was at a loss for words. I had no idea what I was going to do with my life from that point. My TV was obvi totaled! How was I to get to work without a TV???\n\nAll I could think about was ""how STUPPID AM I for driving my TV so fast over a speedbump!"" With no Auto Insurance on my TV, I was to pay the remainder of the note one $1,307.87 payment at a time.\n\nMy advice to people doing research before purchasing this TV is just don't. Yes, it's a really awesome TV. Yes, it at first seems as though it could solve all of your problems. It's glitz and glamor are highly attractive and can draw you in. In the end though, you will only find that this TV is burdensome and will ruin your life in the worst ways unimaginable.\n\nTake it from me: #don't";BEWARE!!! Most Auto Insurance policies WON'T cover this TV!

I would have thought that with a boy, he could do more physical labor, thus worth more...but that's not the case (something about slavers wanting a young girl in the sack).  So we only got 1/2 of what James got (and WE thought we didn't want twins...little did we know).  So we have to raise the other $15,000 before we can purchase a refurbished one (TV not child).  We saw one in a house we were doing a B&E on in Scottsdale, and I must say the picture was phenomenal!  The screen is so big, we could see it from a window of the house next door we were also doing a B&E on (we would have taken the TV, but because of the size and weight, we couldn't sneak it out under our shirts...if you know what I mean...which is ANOTHER perk of getting this TV).

1283;385.0;3.0;23.0;"I recently heard of the ""flat panel"" craze and thought, what the heck, it's been a number of years since my last television upgrade, so it's worth a splurge. A close friend at my local knitting book club recommended this model; the same friend clued me in to the ""E book"" craze and said displaying ""E books"" on this big panel was a kind sight for dimming eyes. I'm not completely sure why it wouldn't work for titles beginning with other letters though, and furthermore the pages remain the same size and my dining table provides an even bigger reading surface for books. However, I still immediately ordered this television set through the telephone. Amazon's failure to mail me a new print catalogue was only a minor inconvenience, as I had the exact model number. The last time they sent me a catalogue was in 1995 and it came in 300 volumes. I won't take off a star for this though as it is not the manufacturer's fault.\n\nDelivery was a little difficult, as the instructions didn't specify that a loading dock was required. I don't have a loading dock at my house, although from now I think installing one will be a good idea. I took off half a star for this omission.\n\nBuild quality is extremely good. I'm glad this is not one of those cheap plastic made-in-Japan sets that are so popular amongst the youth these days. I am not happy with the competition from Asian countries, what with their low cost labor taking away good American jobs.\n\nInstallation, however, was a nightmare. I unplugged both the VCR and Betamax players from my old televsion (not to brag, but I have the money to keep up with all the latest formats). However, this television apparently does not have any inputs for my players. I was eager to insert my complete Baywatch videotape collection to salivate over at large size, but I guess that's not going to happen now. No antennas were included either, so I'm not sure what shows I can watch.\n\nBy now the deliverymen had already carted away my old television. ""For junking,"" they said, although I know they were secretly going to make it the centerpiece of their living room. I pretended not to care, since my old television uses first-generation cathode ray tube technology (I was an early adopter) and would be quite heavy for me to carry to the neighborhood swap meet. It was top of the line back then though and cost $198.50, which in 2013 dollars is just a tad under the purchase price of this new set. So let it not be said that I downgraded when I bought this new set.\n\nWhile I waited for the local Radioshack to return my phone calls about buying adaptors for my cassette players, I thought I could at least rotate over the panel to display the pretty image on the back as a painting (it's the picture of the tree in the snow in the product description). However, my television apparently did not come with the image on the back side. It was all black. This was very disappointing, as I think the product images should match the product itself.\n\nIt was then that I noticed that I would need a A/C power converter as well. Like most homes in this country, my house has integrated A/C outlets that output at 60Hz. The television does specify that it is a 120Hz model. Oh well, when you pay premium for an import, I guess you'll have to put up with the manufacturing country's eccentricities. Similarly, the connector came with three prongs. I'm not sure what country this is from, but all of my outlets are 100% American. I am awaiting my electrician to return my call regarding rewiring the house for 120Hz outlets.\n\nIn the meantime, I had my handy neighbor paint over the back side of the panel (where the tree-in-the-snow picture was supposed to be) with white paint. My neighbor is an aspiring artist and complimented me on how the frame of my television was just like an easel. It was a bit of a waste of talent to have him paint only white though. But this made the back panel into a perfect surface to project my slide projector onto (again, not to brag, but all the walls in my house are mahogany and unfit for a projector).\n\nOnce Radioshack and the electrician get back to me to put the television in working order, I will update with a full review. It'd be helpful though, Amazon, if you could print your own review forms along with a return mailing address at the top. I had to write this one on my own stationery and it was hard to find your mailing address in the phone book. Are you under A or Z?\n\nIn the meantime I will go back to reading newspapers for my evening entertainment. They said radio would kill print, and they were wrong. They then said television would kill print, and boy were they wrong again. It just goes on to show the ephemeral nature of these gizmos.";Great Panel, Needs Adaptation to Work

It's about the size of one of those twister game mats and I have to literally jump on the buttons in order to change the channel... Although, it is hard to find AAAAAAAAA batteries for the remote.  This tv is definately worth selling our next 3 unborn children to brad-gelina. If I could have done my life differently, I would have bought this tv instead of investing in Enron.

405;394.0;5.0;21.0;"After my second rap album went double platinum I felt that my financial situation was stable enough for me to buy some things that most would consider to be overpriced. I own six yachts, because no one actually takes their yacht out of the harbor anymore. You just buy a bunch of yachts in locations you want to visit and fly back and fourth on your Learjet. Of course, I have three different Learjets that are designed for different distance and capacity ranges. It is very low class to spend all of your time on a yacht so you also need beach houses at all of your yacht locations. All of this can become very tiring.\n\nBetween all of the studio time, the flying, the yachting, and intimate raltions with beautiful women something was missing. I needed a compound worthy of my stature. After a lot of searching I realized that most of northern Detroit was basically in ruins, so I bought it. If you drew a horizontal line north of Auburn Hills I own all of it up to Cananda. After my ""Loisiana Purchase-ish"" type land grab I had a 17th Century style castle built on the highest point to overlook my once automobile manufacturing heavy kingdom.\n\nNow, I'm sure you're probably wondering what happened to all of the dark skinned, native inhabitant of this land, aren't you? Well, I am a kind ruler and one of considerable mercy. I have installed what would be considered as a Feudal System in the kingdom. All of my serfs are given a place to live while every second of available daylight is filled with toilings of both farm and field. We will be starting an Organic produce company soon. I figure if the NCAA can make billions off of their employees without paying them while providing nothing more than food, water, shelter, and trade skill training then why can't I? I've also decided to ""one up"" the NCAA by enacting Prima Nocta in my kingdom. I figure that the future of my realm will be much more successful if the bulk of it are my offspring. Multi-Platimun rapper with a kingdom > Inner-city project dwellers. If the Pistons ever need a practice squad I'll drop the law for a few years, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\n\nBack to my castle: I live in the top floor with a giant window in the main living chamber that overlooks the moat, drawbridge, Organic farm, and some of the serfs' living quarters. I do hear the serfs will have running water within the next five years. I've never actually seen where they live up close. The drawbridge over the moat is always up and I always travel by helicopter around the realm. Sorry, I'm getting off track again. This gigantic window in the main living chamber always gets dirty and the constant struggle of flying to human traffic auctions in Havana along with the costs of a winning bid on a virgin female under 20 years of age has grown tiring. The male serfs have grown quite fond of this as I always release a new young girl to them weekly. I figured morale would be low amoung them once this ritual stopped, but they can find other activities to engage in. They're paid to work, not to have fun. Well, they aren't paid at all, but they are getting a free education of a valuable trade. How can they complain?\n\nAnyways, back to this window; I hired an IMAX crew to install four cameras along the top of the castle wired in series to produce one panoramic shot of the kingdom. There was one problem: I needed a TV worthy of this view. I gathered all of my horses and all of my men and had them search low and high. Finally, success was achieved! I did a cameo on a Mariah Carey album to pay for this amazing television. After two weeks the Postal Service Postmaster of greater-Detroit sent a messenger to alert me of its arrival. When I first powered on all 85 inches of this Ultra-HD 4K miracle I felt like what I feel the three wisemen must have felt looking down at baby Jesus. My baby Jesus wasn't born in a stable, it was born in a castle. I also felt that a gaggle of ill informed Hebrews would not come after this television at any point either. All-in-all, this was shaping up to be amazing!!!\n\nThe view of my kingdom is much more clear than what it used to be in silly ""real life."" I want to thank everyone at Samsung for making my life complete. I want to thank all of my fans for buying my music allowing me to buy most of northern Michigan. Apparently I also got something called the ""Upper Peninsula."" I have no idea what a peninsula is. Maybe it's just a slang term for Canada that I'm not familiar with. I don't know, I've never been there and I don't really care. I feel like another kingdom would be spreading me too thin, so I'll allow the natives of that place to guide themselves until I feel that my army is strong enough to invade and restore order afterwards.";A window into the soul

I was surprised to find all the employees in the break room when I showed up at midnight. So, I was unhappy with what I felt was misinformation. The only other issues with the pick up was my ski mask was difficult to see out of and it was hard to hold my gun and lift the TV at the same time. Lastly, a major inconvenience was the ensuing police chase which caused damage to the rental van. I did manage to lose my pursuers only to get home and discover the darn thing doesn't fit in my entertainment center.;Nice TV but...

""My precious!""  I figured that there are enough videos of people stealing big tv from Walmart, with one that had an employee help them to their car with a small 80 inch TV.  I figured this was my ticket.\nEverything went well, until we tried to get it through the front doors, and for the life of the greeter trying to help, couldn't get it to fit through the damn alarm sensors.

I was scared,  so I told him I would sell my 13 yr old daughter to him for $10k so I could buy the Apple of my Eye.  He nearly jumped out of his Hubaround.  I told him it was on a year contract because my wife was screaming at me.  I told my wife an offer like this only comes once in a lifetime and I would let her watch ""50 Shades of Grey"" on it when the movie came out...she fell for it.\nUnfortunately, I had to put this awesome TV outside, as it wouldn't fit through the door.  Now all the neighborhood camps out on the lawn watching their movies, and 50 Shades ended up in a massive adult scene in our front lawn.\nWith that said, be sure you measure first to make sure it will fit.  I had to return this early because it doesn't hold up well to the elements. I do think this TV is cursed.  My transmission on my Chevette went out on my way back to return this; Ebola broke out because of lack of funding;  my daughter Amanda has a serious lack of trust in me; and to top it off, apparently my wife is pregnant despite my ability to not have any more kids.  Run away from this TV, it's like Annabelle.  It's cursed.";Why not to buy this TV!!!

1474;411.0;5.0;22.0;I recently moved to Cleveland from Florida.  My wife and I miss the year round Florida sun.  So we bought 40 of these and replaced all of our windows. With that, $25k of wiring, and a MacBook pro and we are looking at nothing but ocean views from every room and we have yet to miss a sunset.  Thinking of replacing the windows in my car too.  My daily drive is quite unsightly.  Now all we need is a good tv for the family room.;Don't just buy one!!
52;412.0;5.0;11.0;In last winter I had a problem with my window and was looking for some metal bars to fix it. I specifically bought these metal bars because it came with a free TV panel in the middle. I really didn't know they were selling this much large hardware items online. But happy to see this with a TV received as a bonus item. Since I have another old TV, I used this free TV as a window cover because the Rob guy, who is in the next apartment will not complain about his daughter seeing some secret stuffs through my window every night. Thanks for solving my problems. I would recommend these metal bars to anyone.;Nice Hardware item
181;413.0;5.0;15.0;I bought this to watch my favorite cable channel, FoodTV, so I could more easily follow their recipes exactly as shown.  I now weigh over 700 lbs.;Five Stars
183;414.0;5.0;15.0;I have successfully taken this tv apart and built a DeLorean time machine. Who knew 4K TV could produce a flux capacitor? No need to bump your head here, Doc, Samsung has the technology. So as for a buying point, $40k = time travel. I'm no Einstein but that equation is spot on.;4K to the Future

914;419.0;5.0;21.0;This was the ONLY thing my Husband LeeJ asked for this Television for Christmas so I decided to start selling my body to the guys a the local ball park. Now I can't look at anyone in the eyes at my sons tball games. We've now decided to just have someone film his games so that we can watch him play on this beautiful TV. It's almost like really being there! But now without being reminded how much our coach's balls stink. Thanks Samsung.;Love watching the ball games
915;420.0;5.0;21.0;So I see all this fake reviews here and I am impressed how people just write so many dumb things. This TV is great, if you are considering buying and you can afford it, go for it, you can't go wrong with this one. However the only thing I could tell you is that you really need space for it, unless you use it as a bed just like I am doing right now. Worth every penny, most comfortable TV in the market and you will never have to leave your room again, unless you go Dragon hunting which is pretty awesome too. The other day I took an arrow to the knee, an just by lying down in my Samsung I was completely recovered. I still can't believe how poeple complain about the price, you just need to sell one Dragon's tooth to be able to afford it.;First real buyer.

My wife wasn't really on board at first but I told here that with a house, you're going to have to fix stuff all the time and pay extra for insurance and it was going to be nothing but a headache anyways. She was still being unreasonable at that point so I told her if I use this new credit card, they give us $200 cash back.....combine that with the already crazy discounted price on amazon, its like I am practically getting this thing for FREE! I then told her she promised me ""For Better or For Worst"" so why would you want to leave when get this baby would definitely be in the ""FOR BETTER"" category.\n\nUPDATE!!!!!\n\nOMG....This thing is so amazing. You have not lived until you have witnessed Duck Dynasty in 85 inch High def. My wife is super happy to because now she gets to date a life like Adam Levine because this TV makes him look SO REAL!!

My problem is that i work a very demanding schedule as a dog sled operator. I am gone on adventures for many days/nights in a row. I wanted the TV for my brand new infant. I had heard of this channel called ""baby TV"" (perhaps, you have too?) and the set up seemed like a perfect fit.\n\nMy thinking was if the TV is big enough that the kid will actually think there are real people with him all the time! it was brilliant! And, with 4,000 pixels, hell, i wouldn't know the difference - much less a 2 month old. But, that will never happen now due to stupid shipping policies. You would think if someone wants to spend 40k on a TV they would find a way to ship it to Alaska. Thanks for nothing, amazon.";$40k and they still won't ship it to Alaska...Thanks for nothing Amazon.
508;426.0;1.0;20.0;I got this thing delivered to me the other day and was very excited to open and play with it. There are so many things wrong with it though. One of the first things I look for in a TV is weather or not my Atari 2600 will hook up to it. I cannot for the life of me find anywhere to plug in my AV connection. Now to be fair, I have only been searching for 3 days, but the tv is so large that I am a measly half way done and I really don't know if I will find one.\n\nI don't always look for things wrong though. I am fortunate enough to have been able to provide shelter to 17 homeless men with the box it came in. With the packing, they each got a pillow and enough TP to last 4 years. It was the first time that I ordered something from amazon that actually filled out the box. Last time I ordered a flash card I got it in the same size box....\n\nAll in all though I am a little smug. I cannot keep this TV because at such a reasonable price I know everyone will have one and I will not be original any more.;Dont waste your money
550;427.0;2.0;20.0;I bought this tv for my daycare. NOT a good idea. I can't get the kids down for their naps because they think Barney will eat them in their sleep. There goes my break.;Good for kids? NOT!
591;428.0;4.0;20.0;Since the drive in movie joint shut down in 1984 it has been hard to gather more than four hundred friends together to watch a movie together. Thanks to Samsung and this jewel, problem solved. I purchased this television and mounted it on the side of my house facing the parking lot next door. While my wife is getting a little tired running the concession stand through the kitchen window, I figure I'll recoup the cost of theTV by next summer. Getting used to the permanent smell in the house of popcorn, nacho cheese and old hot dog water was the only draw back.;Works for the whole neighborhood.
638;429.0;5.0;20.0;With the low power consumption and other energy saving features built into this television, I am saving lives this winter by keeping power rates at affordable but reasonable levels for the working poor.\n\nI feel that every time I turn my television on, I am giving something back to others.  That makes me feel good inside.;Low Power Consumption helps keep rates low for the common people
676;430.0;5.0;20.0;I saw this EXACT same TV at one of the warehouse stores at a much lower price.  I can't tell you the name of the store, but it rhymes with Bostco.  They had them on sale for $299.  I bought 5.  I would have bought 6, but I thought that might be a little extravagant.  I don't believe in flaunting my wealth.;You can get it cheaper
795;431.0;5.0;20.0;I don't understand why so many people are up in arms over the price.\n\nI mean, a TV this size has to cost about what? $180.00 in raw materials.  Add in the $1.75/ per day wages they paid some over paid under worked sweat shop employee to assemble it. Costs to package it and shipping and customs and what...it probably costs them $250.00 to bring this product to the states.\n\nYou can't expect them to give them away for free, can you?\n\nYay!

1334;436.0;2.0;21.0;"Well when I ordered this television, I think my biggest problem was deciding if I should put it in my mega yacht, or my mega mansion. Well that problem was fairly easily resolved by just purchasing two of them. They tried to offer me free shipping, so incredibly insulted I told them ""Do I seem like a charity case to you?"" So as per my request I paid full charge for shipping. But in between the day I ordered the television and the day it arrived, I found interest in the Space Shuttle program, so naturally, I had to order one more of these televisions, at this point I had bought up all that were in stock at the time. I expressed my discontent to amazon quite adamantly. What if I had to buy a fourth one? What if I was to have a get together and needed a new television for one of the guest rooms? Than they told me that if I did order another one, they would be ""unable"" to deliver it on one of those little flying drones. This infuriated me to no end, almost as angry as I was when my stock broker told me my owners equity dropped .7% since last year. So in the end I just ended up buying amazon, and I now have a standing order for all of these televisions that are produced, so if you were thinking of buying one oh well, you should of been more wealthy.";Sorry I already bought them all
1434;437.0;5.0;21.0;I purchased this with my inheritance I received from my uncle Pablo Escobar's tragic death. He was killed in a horrible roofing accident. When it finally arrived via freight ship I picked it up at the nearby pier. It took 6 full grown men and 3 midgets to lug it up 3 flights of stairs to our 2 bedroom apartment (I have a roommate). After attempting to mount it in my room (10'x10') I realized it might be just a tad small. Guess I will keep a look out for something else.\n\nNote to whoever wishes to return this item. The return policy stipulates buyer pays for shipping. I have therefore decided to just keep the TV. My grandmother is having a yard sale next weekend. Will try to unload it to a potential buyer then.;Great Picture. But size is meh.

Doubles as a great painting easel.\n\nJust like everyone else on here I had to have this TV. There are thousands of stories on Amazon about this TV, and if mine is lost in the sea of reviews no one will miss it, but this is my story and it must be told.\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about myself.  I'm an impulse buyer.  If I see something and I like it, I'm going to buy it.  If I don't have the money, I'll find a way to get the money.  Regardless, I will get what I want, and I wanted this TV.\n\nHere is what I did to start saving money:\n\n1. Defaulted on all of my credit cards, student loans, car loan, and any other outstanding loans I had at the time.\n2. Filed for bankruptcy so I wouldn't have to pay back on the defaulted loans.\n3. Camped out in the woods across from my parent's house so that I could intercept their mail.  I was looking for credit card offers in their name (they still had good credit).\n4. Applied for several credit cards in my parent's name.  Got approved, and intercepted those cards as well.\n\nThen I got fired from my job because I was never there.  I must have spent too much time camping out in the woods across from my parents house.\n\nI began to feel depressed.  I had no job, no money, and no car (it was repossessed).  However, I still had my apartment, cable, internet, and my Xbox.  Regardless of my mental state I committed to this purchase and ordered the TV.\n\nHere's where I realize my life is about to take a turn for the worse:\n\n1. While waiting for the TV to arrive I get an eviction notice from my landlord.  I have 30 days to remove my belongings from the apartment.\n2. My parents start to get the credit card bills for the purchase of the TV.  I forgot to change the billing address of the credit cards.  I do not answer the door when my parents come to my apartment.\n3. Comcast shut off my cable and internet due to non-payment.  No problem because I still have my Xbox and if this TV has UHF or UNF hookups I'll still get some stations via antenna.\n4. My electricity got shut off due to non-payment.\n5. TV arrives just before I get evicted.  Box is smashed in on every corner, and it looks like gorillas have been jumping on it.\n6. I remain optimistic and open the package.  TV is in a less than acceptable state.  Screen is scratched, corners are dinged up, cables and remote is missing, and there are no UHF/UNF hookups for an antenna.\n7. I immediately call Samsung; however, I get disconnected mid-call because Verizon shuts off my cell phone due to non-payment.\n8. Someone keeps banging on my apartment door.  Maybe my parents are still mad?  Maybe it's the landlord?\n9. The next day I visit my parent's house to confess what I did.  I found them both dead.  Maybe they died from financial stress?  I bury them under their house.  No one will find them there.\n10. I move all of my belongings from my apartment into my parent's house.\n\nI now live in my parent's house.  I regret buying this TV.  I don't even get cable anymore.";My story.

I got a call from the power company asking me to be more considerate next time and give them a little warning.\n\nOnce you get past that though, it makes a great baby sitter. You should see the beautiful tan our 2 year old has! We also got a new dog. Or maybe it's a cat.

A few of my pet peeves include Martians, fake NASA ice cream (which is more like flavored foam) and not being able to watch tv while in orbit.  Let me tell you, my life has changed since buying this tv! I mounted it to the roof of my house facing the sky so now I can watch all of my favorite shows from space.

So the TV was worth not having to deal with that hassle.\n\nMy only complaint is that it doesn't have a slot for my VHS's.  You'd think a TV of this caliber would accommodate this format - what a disappointment.  I should have read the specs more carefully.  I guess I was too ""in the moment"" with purchasing this TV at $5k less than the original price.\n\nTo make matters worse, I had to spend $5 at Goodwill to purchase a VHS player, only to find out that once I played a tape, the picture quality is AWFUL!

It's a SMART TV - duh!) to complaints that it's ""too big"" (really? It's called a home ""theater"", and by definition, a theater is quite large. If you don't own a McMansion, then obviously you don't need or deserve this TV. Again - DUH!).\n\nAnd who's this fool selling his daughter into white slavery? Get real! There are more practical ways to afford this TV. For example, invite your husband for a romantic hotel getaway. Once there, he will be inexplicably abducted, but left in the hotel lobby the following day with a jagged incision and unprofessional-looking sutures. Of course, he will mysteriously be sans one kidney. But the shock of it all will be greatly eased by an equally inexplicable infusion of funds into you bank account, roughly but coincidentally in the amount a kidney fetches in the black market organ trade. And while your husband is recouping from his ordeal, you lovingly buy this TV to occupy him during his long hours coping with post traumatic stress disorder while he watches your favorite daytime talk shows and evening television dramas with you. You experience no separation from a beloved family member, you get the ""wife of the year award"" for giving your man such an amazing gift, you are the envy of whiner have-nots like those who posted above, and you add the finishing touch to your McMansion (which you could have, too, if you were to have an unfortunate and debilitating fall down a flight of stairs while taking a tour of the Department of Justice). Of course, this isn't how I afforded this TV (or my McMansion, for that matter)... I'm just saying.\n\nAdmittedly, this wouldn't have been such a good option in Mr. Thach's case, because I learned from B. Anderson when he visited from the future that in a few short years, Amanda's twin sister Jennifer will experience kidney failure. And if one of Amanda's kidneys had been removed? Well, she wouldn't be able to give one to her sister, thereby saving Jennifer's life. Still, I'm sure Mr. Thach could have come up with an option other than selling Amanda into white slavery. I mean, didn't I read that he has a wife named Peg? There WAS another option, and I think his ""family decision"" to sell Amanda into slavery was in fact a self-serving and selfish act. I only hope Amanda doesn't experience PTSD like my husband, because the constant twitching almost induces regret (not that I did anything to contribute to his unfortunate ordeal. I only meant that I ""regret"" that he had to go through this).\n\nHang in there, Amanda. And to the rest of you, quit whining! Good things come to people of action. Unlike me, you'll never live in a McMansion or own such an impressive TV if you just sit around on your backsides complaining.";Stop the Whining Already!

606;484.0;2.0;18.0;I bought this product second hand and saved a cool $10,000. The quality of the picture is astounding and the colors just pop from the screen. I am British and as a fan of Geordie Shore (our version of Jersey Shore) me and my dearest wife Priscilla tuned in to watch our favorite group on tanned alcoholic degenerates. We tuned in to the correct channel and sat enjoying the advertisements prior to the show starting (i have to say this TV makes capitalism much more tolerable). What happened next is one of the most horrific experiences of mine and Priscilla's lives. The screens sheer size and brightness is, as aforementioned, wonderful. Not when watching Geordie Shore. The shows opening credits began to roll. The parade of falsely tanned people on the screen was projected with such intensity that it was like having a small part of the actual sun in our living room. I fell to the floor clutching my face screaming for help as my retinas burned intensely. As for my wife, she wears contact lenses. She didn't fall to her knees like myself, she stood up, began screaming loudly, running around the room and pouring any liquids she could into her eyes (including my prized whisky collection). It turns out that the sheer brightness of Holly Hagen's tan as projected by the screen, had melted my wife's contact lenses to her eyeballs. I count myself lucky as i only lost most of my vision, Priscilla however has had to have her eyeballs removed and replaced with glass alternatives. We have now sold this TV and purchased a pair of $30,000 unnecessary speakers instead so we can enjoy listening to any documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman in excellent quality. The reasons for giving the product two stars is that i still to this day cant bring myself to blame the TV entirely for the mishap, it was after all partly down to the fact that Channel 5 airs such trash and that our society has devolved to a point of using fake tan on ourselves, that this scenario occurred. So take heed people, if you do purchase this wonderful product avoid watching shows that are likely to include tanned people.;Avoid Tans!

I'm just glad that as a ""Prime"" member, that I am able to get Amazon to deliver food and soft drinks to our front door so none of us ever have to get up at all.\n\nThis is the best purchase I have ever made.\n\nI would have given it 5 stars, but the remote came with some cheap batteries.

No browsers would load. My phone died at the worst possible time.\n\nSo, ""go home and cancel the order"", right? Wrong.

With that being said after getting that killjoy of technology out if my chest it was time to get my hands on two of these babies.\nOne may ask don't you need that device to live? Yes I need two of them! One for the the TV room and one for the bathroom. Who else wouldn't want that ear to ear 4k crystal ear IMAX style viewing while dropping the kids off at the pool?

But sadly at 120 hz.\nAfter that back alley removal of my device and being pretty sure I saw god because I may have died during the removal of my device. I can assure you that there is a god after seeing this picture. 4k resolution, heart stopping, or it could just be drugs wearing off.\nI guess the final answer to your question is: Yes, I plan on being burried with my TVs and my funeral will be broadcasted in FULL 4k HD to the overflow crowd at Bunkers Funeral home.\nAll in all a good entry level TV;Clarity of life

10;514.0;4.0;19.0;I couldn't wait for this to arrive and prime got it here on time.  But next came the setup. Warning read all the instructions and practice before you attempt to remove it from the box. You will need to work fast or it gets to heavy for two people to move. Once outside the box it takes on a life of its own and grows at a rapid rate as it balloons from its shipping weight of 21 pounds to its full operating weight of just over 189 lbs. Once it attains its full weight the picture is unbelievable. I would really like to know the technology behind all this as I could save a lot on postage.\nUpdate - seems they maybe fixed the weight or maybe it went the other way. At first the shipping rate was listed as 21 lbs now it says 319 lbs. As the product weight is 189 lbs I guess you get a lot of protection and foam for $40K. Will keep you updated. But I haven't seen this model in stores so if you want it buy on Amazon and use your Prime delivery.;Great TV but setup is tricky
357;515.0;5.0;14.0;When I saw the low price guarantee, the fact that it was $5000 off, and that there were only two left in stock, I knew I had to jump on this deal. But then, my wife had a better idea.\n\nWe spent months planning for the introduction of our new TV. When it was finally on sale at Rent-A-Center for a measly $1000 per month, we put down the money and took home our nice TV. It didn't fit in the van, so we had to duct tape the box to the roof, but we eventually got it home. As soon as we were home, we unpacked it and momentarily basked in its 85-inch glory. Then my wife and I set to work installing it in our RV. We had to rip out the kitchen, and it was a squeeze getting it through the door, but soon the deed was done. Once it was installed we cancelled the credit card Rent-A-Center charged, packed some provisions and our 10 year old daughter into the RV, and left. Rent-A-Center quickly found out and presumably sent the police, but we torched our home and were gone before they arrived. Almost immediately, the issue of who would drive and who would watch TV became an issue, and it soon developed into a fistfight which I lost. So with my wife in the back, I drove as far as I could, freaking out as I passed every cop car. Eventually we ran low on gas, and my wife and I had another fight over who would fill the tank. Luckily for me, I won this one and sat two feet away from the 85 incher, mesmerised by its 4K goodness.\n\nOur credit card must have triggered an alarm, because by the time the gas tank was half full the police arrived at the gas station. My wife tried to run into the RV as I sprinted to the drivers seat from in front of the TV, but she sadly died in a hail of police brutality. I pulled out of the station, my Cummins 600hp RV engine roaring, and got back onto the freeway. However, the allure of the TV was ever present, so I plopped my daughter into the drivers seat, taught her which was gas and which was brake, and got back to my love affair with the TV.\n\nI am now writing this review on the TV, and I can assure you that this $39,997 Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV for only $1000 is quite literally a steal. I recommend it to all other RV owners who might wish to follow in my footsteps.;Truly Orgasmic

However, after I unpacked it, I found that it did not come with the requisite Transparent Aluminum protective screen.  This makes for a huge safety risk.  I was also unable to get the little row of moving white lights at the bottom to work correctly, but this is a minor inconvenience.\n\nOtherwise, the display is very clear, and looks particularly sharp when the ship first goes to warp drive.  Hopefully Samsung will get the shielding correct on future models.;Unable to Use on Starship Due to Lack of Transparent Aluminum Screen

Our kids won't travel unless they can watch tv.  Unfortunately it did not come with connectors for the headrests of our Escalade (so annoying), so we simply bought a city bus and 200 horsepower diesel generator.  Once the retro fit was complete our family of 4 has just enough room.\n\nNow we can watch Disney when shooting around town to pick up groceries and run errands!  So convenient.\n\nAnd recently when we flew down to Florida to visit sea world we decided to bring it with us for the trip!  It was super easy, we just picked up a portable generator and a our landscaping staff to carry everything around.  We did get some dirty looks at the airport terminal though (jealous).  An older lady tripped over the surround sound wires and the poor thing broke her hip (someone needs better glasses) and another family complained about the generator exhaust making their kids feel dizzy (hippies).  But then the flight attendants would not let us bring it on the plane!!!  Our poor little angels cried, projectile vomited, and bit passengers the entire flight.  I am never flying southwest again, horrible customer service.  So we had to abandon the tv, generator, surround sound system and team of Mexicans at the airport.  We bought another one upon our return.\n\nAnd totally buying another one for the guest house, so worth it!  Love.;Travels Really well.

She thought she really was riding off the cliff and she DIED!!! Oh, I miss her so much!! And all because Samsung had to make such a wonderful television with such amazing picture quality.

I needed this TV. I asked him if he would like to pursue a degree or have this 85 inch bad boy in the living room, he hesitated at first but after a little explaining I had him convinced this was the smart thing to do. So I sold my car and emptied out his college fund and after demolishing the wall in between the living room and garage we had enough space to set this thing up. Thanks to Samsung me and my son will be spending a lot more time together.;Father son time at an all time high

I thought about slightly below the elbow but then I decided to contact Amazon to as if that would be sufficient.  The first agent I talked to said above the arm, slightly below the shoulder should be enough.  I made the first cut and in mo time at all I had my arm entirely off.  I called Amazon back and spoke to another agent who said the arm would not be enough and directed my to chose which one would be best and to definitely cut as high up I could get, the closer to my hip the better.  I completed removal of the leg in slightly longer time that the arm.  I packaged both the arm and the leg in dry ice and overnighted them to Amazon and before I could say ouch I had the TV delivered to my front door. Good new is since I was in my workshed I managed to fashion an acceptable peg leg to replace the one I removed.  I thought about the arm and decided that I only needed one to work the remote.  Other than the incorrect information I got from the first agent who said an arm would be enough, the puddles of blood I had to clean up and the irritating ""ghost limb"" feeling I get occasionally I would say this was a rather pleasant transaction.";Well worth the cost

So far the experience has been great, but I do have to say there is a lack of adequate programming available at this Ultra HD resolution. Apparently there is not enough public demand for that in the market yet, or so my butler tells. I guess I'm just ahead of the curb when it comes to sophisticated television viewing habits.\n\nAll praise aside, these will probably be outdated by next fall and need to be replaced. But hey, as long as there are no ridiculous minimum wage increases cutting into my yearly bonuses during the next fiscal year, I should be able to afford replacing my existing fleet with the next 5K Super-Ultra HD series or whatever the dopes over at Samsung have released by then.;Great TV's, but do lack adequate programming.

However, after exhausting all means of obtaining a loan to purchase it, I had to turn to the black market. unfortunately the only things of any value were my eyes, so I sold an eye for $35k now that didn't get me the TV but I was close. Then an infection set in, most likely from the less than sterile environment of an Ukrainian Thai restaurant basement as an operating room. So, I sold the other eye which paid for the antibiotics and brought me back to my goal amount.

Lots of arm-waving and shouting.  The TV had a nervous breakdown, hid in the corner, and turned into an 18"" b&w.  It is going to cost us a small fortune to get it therapy to restore its sense of self-worth and regain its former colorful personality and sharpness.  I really think we should cut our losses and find it a nice cardboard box under a bridge somewhere, but my husband says it is our responsibility to try and rehabilitate it.";Expensive in ways we didn't expect ...
760;575.0;1.0;16.0;"I recently purchased this tv at Don Quiyote and I loved it.\n\nI primarily use my television for the use of enjoying pornography.  Sure the internet is out there and trust me I realize we've all gotten use to a quick wank from those pornhub.com videos that are only 2.5 minutes long but I'm from the old school and I like to take my time and make an experience out of it.\n\nSo after bringing home my tv I poured a glass of wine (a 1984 Rothschild Beleaux Moi which is a heavenly swallow) and fired up some Asia because I felt ""Heat of the Moment"" would be apropro..  Now a purist would say ""Why not ""Barry White hes got a sexier voice""?  Well the video I had procured for this maiden voyage into 4000 dpi auto eroticism was ""Cock Asian"" and not ""Sister Act"".\n\nSeeing as how this was going to be an experience and not just the old maintenance spit-and-stroke I had also purchased a 5 gallon flagon of ""Ye Olde Wanking Butter"" which is made in the old country by some monks of the Epicondylitis order from 52 different all-natural ingredients and boys do those guys know their business!  My only regret being that though I do love organic products that contain no chemicals or GMO's,  I really wouldnt have minded a little bit of the ole Human Growth Hormone if you know what I mean.  Regrettable, but I got a grip on myself and soldiered on.\n\nThe picture was incredible!  During one particular scene there was a very large and noticeable pimple that had developed on one of the actresses left buttocks.  It drew my attention away from most of the action and while I am a staunch heterosexual and am in no way a ""meat gazer"" I do like to enjoy the pistoning-action of a proper rogering caught on film.  My preoccupation with this grand mal zit was in no small way exacerbated by the incredible quality of the picture.  Eventually my preoccupation became a full blown and almost Poe-like obsession due to the male stars incredible endurance.\n\nI crept closer to the screen...Timidly I reached out a finger and touched the screen.\n\nWhat I felt was amazing!  I had the sensation of touching the supple yet firm buttock of a incredibly arousing young woman!  It wasn't the warm smooth glass of a television but rather the warm smooth ass of a tele-asian!  Her body minus the pimple (and possibly a completely compromised and sundered vagina) was unbelieveable!  My mind reeled with the possibilities!  This gruesome twosome onscreen was about to get a ""The Ring"" reversal as I contemplated climbing through the front and making it a freesome threesome!\n\nThat's when I did it.  I went too far.\n\nAs the pimple was the only imperfection I felt might mar my experience I decided to once again take matters ""into my own hands"".\n\nI reached out and popped it.\n\nWhat happened next is why I have decided to return this television.\n\nMy face was coated in a copius and cloying amount of zit juice.  I staggered back onto the couch with an ""Aaargh"" worthy of a pirate who has had his booty taken (think about it) and when I cleared my eye I realized with horror that the worse had happened.\n\nIt wasn't the zit that had popped and sullied my face...\n\nNay, twas the inevitable ""Money Shot""!  I had been victim of some flying double ended ropers that had landed upon my countenance with SWAT like precision.\n\nI'm returning this television.";Picture is actually 4-dimensional

I specifically told them to shrink wrap the box for rain protection and leave it in the front yard.

Instead they went with delivery protocol and pushed the TV up on the front porch with the UPS bulldozer, then when the UPS crane picked up the top of the box and leaned it against the house.........well you can guess the results..........The Samsung crushed the entire house and of course everything in it.  Thank goodness no one was home at the time except my wife's cat.\nSamsung and Amazon were pretty upset but came together to make the situation right.  They have rebuilt my house (even better than before I might add) and then sent me two new Samsung 85"" TV's to make up for what they did.  At first I thought, wow, this is really overkill ; what am I going to do with two huge TV's at my house.  The answer was simple (you already know what I did if you have been paying attention to the CNN or FOX news coverage).  I put one in the front yard facing the road and the other in the backyard.  I then used a super hi-def. camcorder to point at my house inside this huge parallel wall of humming technology and broadcast all my comings and goings over live TV.

Well aside from there being no native content currently or in the near future, I can tell you that 1080p upscaled looks super crisp.  It's almost as if I have a high end blu ray player.  If you want to imagine what 4k looks like though, the Samsung instruction manual cleary states to find the biggest window you can find and stare through it.  Yeah THAT sharp.  Sometime I stare through my window at home for hours just thinking of what a great deal I got.  Sometimes I even imagine I'm watching 4k through my windshield when driving to work.\n\nIf you have a extra 40k laying around this is definitely worth it.  Even if you don't you can manage to get the money after selling yourself on the street for a few years.  It's the best purchase I ever made.

Of course there are other small annoyances which were expected, such as the remote control isn't very good, the 3D features may hurt your internal organs, and the significant tan you acquire from watching the tv for too long.

707;616.0;1.0;15.0;My husband and I were looking for a flat screen TV, and decided that a 55-60 inch would be a great size for our living room. He took over the searching of course, and I THOUGHT we agreed that anything bigger would be too big, and too expensive. He seemed sneaky somehow...so I decides to log on to his amazon account to see what he was looking at, and noticed he had this gigantic TV in his cart....so, instead of turning it into a verbal argument, I added a banana slicer to his cart as well :) ladies...it's not too hard to find one, it's in the section of what customers have also viewed.

My wife and I have been talking for sometime about adding an addition on to our dwelling.  So naturally, when they brought the box to the road, we snatched it up.  Three refrigerator boxes may seem roomy but with four kids it can get cramped.  Since adding the Samsung 85-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV box to our house we hardly ever see the kids anymore.

While you are it could you ask our government to connect my village with electricity so that the by time this TV arrives we can watch the Jesus movie life size?

After checking all my credit cards, I found one with just enough credit to book a return trip to Columbia. Previously I had Skyped with Pablo (can't remember his surname but think it ended ""cobar"") over the internet and facilitated ""a few"" imports on his behalf, He said as he trusted me I could have some on credit as long as he got his money more than 28 days after collection of the ""merchandise"".\n\nThe outward trip was fine although the return home was okay until I hit customs, let me say that a full body search is an experience that everyone should have at least once in their lifetime or twice if they liked it first time round.

We put the tv in the lounge window turn up the volume and enjoy the 4k brilliance from the optimal viewing distance recommended of 40 yards. A hidden bonus is that we have met all our neighbours and for only 10 viewing fee they too enjoy our wonderful TV.\n\nPablo on the other hand hasn't turned out to be the friend I thought he was. Admittedly in my haste to get the TV I had to do a few special deals and after expenses and buying my dream TV I found I was slightly short of what he was looking for.  People can get so uppity when you ""welch on a deal"" (his words not mine BTW). Next thing I knew there was two rather muscly guys on my doorstep asking which part of my body I was least attached to. I said I was attached to all parts of my body (thought a joke would lighten the atmosphere, boy was I wrong), guess something got lost in translation as  not even a trace of smile showed on their faces, then all hell let loose.\n\nFast forward a few hours and I finally managed to do a deal....

762;660.0;5.0;14.0;We had a tough choice-keep the 4 bedroom house, or downsize and get the tv. We opted for the tv-it is just so much more impressive when the galloping horses are life-size. And really, who needs that many bedrooms anyway? Sure, Mom and Dad had hoped they would be able to stay in the house until they died, but frankly, it was kind of dragging on. They will be happier in the nursing home.  We visit on the weekend, if there's nothing good on tv. And the kids? They were always at their friend's houses anyway, might as well make it permanent.

Just tell yourself that no one really needs a 401(k) (Hey, that's why there's Social Security, right?) and lots of people live pretty good lives with one kidney and that other half of your liver will grow back, right?\n\nBut what you don't realize is all of the hidden secondary costs of this thing. Well when I got this thing I thought I was going to be enjoying a marathon session of ""Gillgan's Island"" on DVD all weekend but my weekend turned into a week long process of setting this thing up.\n\nFirst of all getting in the front door. Clearly when the dimensions of your average front door were more-or-less standardized no one had 85-inch TVs in mind. Our ancestors really failed us there. So you're going to need pretty much rip out your entire front door,frame and widen it by a few inches just to get the box into the room; but then angle between the foyer and the doorway to the living room isn't *quite* right so you'll need to start taking down walls, checking to see if they're load-bearing or not. It's just a mess. I suggest doing some research and bringing in a contractor to take some measurements to see if bringing this TV into your living room is possible. It almost reached a point where we had to consider just cutting a big hatch into the roof and then lower this thing in with a helicopter. No matter the route you take, though, you know the government wants to be involved so you need permits and contracts. (Thanks, Obama!)\n\nSo, now you have your TV in the living room. Well, the stand is nice and all but not really practical in most home situations and besides we all want this bad-boy hanging on the wall.  Well, it might surprise you how much this thing weighs and that household walls are not designed to hold a TV this size.  This TV was Mjolnir, my wall was anyone who isn't Thor.  Now we had to install in titanium-alloy braces and beams inside the wall hard-mounted into the Earth itself like bridge supports.\n\nSo, now your TV is in the house. It's hanging on the wall and your components are hooked up. What to do now? Well as fun as the GI marathon was the ""upscaling"" can only do so much and I had to sit pretty far away to make the image look like anything other than a big pile of LEGOS.  No, I need to go beyond digital, beyond HD I needed U-HD!  Well, turns out there's not a lot of UHD discs out there. Which is a shame, really. Can we really call ourselves a society if we don't have a cheap and affordable storage medium that holds half a terrabyte?  Luckily I found some pretty good software that was very good at ""upscaling"" all of my DVDs and Blu-Rays into the UHD but this required a small server farm to be installed into my basement. So between this TV and the server farm your electric bill is going to sky rocket! I'm not sure I've ever seen one of those dials on the electrical meter move so fast!\n\nSo, while I would recommend this TV for great picture quality, clarity and and looking like something you could walk into (and believe me, you will. Mostly because this TV will probably partly obscure the doorway into your kitchen) there's just a lot of secondary costs and problems that you don't think about.  Again, I suggest hiring a consultant first to see if your home is UHD-Ready.";Hidden Costs Galore

I have listed the pros and cons of our favorite person in our house:  Shelly.\n\nPros:\n\n1 - No Remotes!\nShelly comes with a built-in telekinesis AI that reads your mind - even when your not at home!\n\n2 - Shelly talks to us, just like any other woman, about nonsense and unlimited useful garbage.  There is a simple setting to turn ""woman-talk"" feature on or off.  But its pretty awesome on.\n\n3 - With the arm extension (an additional $12,000 but WELL worth it) never ever go out for illegal massages again. Shelly takes care of all your needs while playing certain movies of your choice to get you more in the mood.  wink wink\n\n4 - Shelly comes with the state-of-the-art smell-o-vision which allows you to watch your favorite movies while giving off the smell of your favorite scene!  Imagine being able to smell the beautiful aromas of Hannibal as he cooks Paul Krendler's brain!  WOW!!\n\n5 - Shelly has a built-in ""babysitter"" option.  Just turn on this feature and drop your child in front of the TV.  Then Shelly will play all of your child's favorite shows by reading her mind and keep her occupied for hours.  And - with the additional arm extension - Shelly will be able to change your baby's diapers and rock them to sleep.  Perfect for when you want to simply relax with 4 bottles of wine after a long day of watching TV.\n\n6 - Speaking of wine, Shelly has a bulit-in wine dispenser and keeps wine chilled at the perfect temperature of your choice.\n\n7 - Shelly is fluent in over 6 million forms of communication and even understands Droid talk (and i don't mean Android devices)\n\n8 - Bored.  You can browse Shelly's immerse built-in porn library which contains movies from every genre from every year!\n\n9 - With the wife feature, you can have Shelly clean your house, do your laundry, cook you dinner and even start an argument for no reason whatsoever! And since Shelly can read your mind you'll never have to worry about her making the wrong meals  SIGGHHHH\n\n10 - With the App, never leave home without Shelly. Everything you can do with Shelly at home can be done outside your home.. including hotel rooms.  Wink wink\n\nCons:\n1 - The picture quality is comparable to watching a VHS from 1985.  PURE GARBAGE!  I took off a star because of this.\n\nOverall the picture quality is horrendous but for 40k i don't have to do a dam thing anymore in life!  Thanks Shelly!!!!";We LOVE Shelly!!

I take a picture of my junk, you know to make it look bigger, but only one chick wrote me (again, don't tell my wife...please) and said the picture of my junk is just plain embarrassing. That I am too small.  This ""smart"" TV is full of crap and did NOT make my junk any bigger.  Oh well guess it's back to the growth (or should I say girth) pills.

187;675.0;3.0;10.0;Warning: We recently experienced a potentially deadly side-effect of the ultra-realistic picture on this TV.  While watching a 4K version of Apocalypse Now, in the flame-throwing napalm scene fire blasted out of the TV screen and set our family room on fire.  Much bigger problem than other 4K TVs, as this one is SO much bigger that the flame was huge!  Despite the smell of the napalm lasting till morning, we did not love it (as De Niro's line goes in the movie).  Since we had to let our home-owner insurance lapse to help pay for this TV, we're having to sit on the floor with fire extinguishers handy while avoiding watching any shows with shooting, crashes, and other destruction.  Too bad, as the Chinese archery army scene in Hero was something I was looking forward to.;Damaging side-effect of this huge 4K
238;676.0;5.0;10.0;I'm an avid aquariumist, so the moment that I saw this I just had to have it! Using the lastest HD screensavers I am able to turn this into a really big fish tank!

I am soooooo excited and can fit soooooo many fish in my tank now! And, I never have to buy fish food ever (it pays for itself!) or hear the annoying hum of the filters! My neighbors were upset when I dumped all my prized fish into the canal, something about invasive species, but now I can use my old 85-gallon aquarium for storage, too!

961;685.0;5.0;14.0;"I actually saw this TV at Harrods in London earlier this year. It was being sold for 35,000 British pounds, so it's actually quite a steal at 40,000 US dollars. The only way to describe this TV is to say that it looks ""better than reality"". You felt like you could actually walk through the TV set and teleport into some idyllic parallel universe. There was some very royal looking lady in the store who was flanked by two Harrods security guards and a personal shopper. She bought the TV, and half the other things in the electronics department at Harrods. However, she didn't walk through the TV to end up in the better universe. She already was in that better universe.";I've actually seen it at Harrods. It's awesome.

In fact, I hear Amazon will be penalizing everyone who DOESN'T buy this TV by 2015! I'm in the clear!

(Sorry again, New Yorkers. No hard feelings.) The built in Subwoofer comes in handy for the Holiday parties.  And the price was surprisingly in the normal government price range, since tax payers are paying for this fine piece of S.H.I.E.L.D. Technology.

So amazing in fact, I can't stand just having one in the theater room.  I need one in the living room and the master bedroom.

Seriously, it's so good that I'll likely put off the purchase of my a Aston Martin DB5 a few months to pay cash for it.  Priorities you know.\n\nI'm not sure why people are complaining about the price of this TV though.  It's worth it.  Seriously, unless you are a low wage worker making less than $300/hr, you shouldn't be whining about the price.  Isn't minimum wage now around $75.25 hour? I remember it had a 7 and 5 in it.

Primarily I use them for security monitors, but I have one set aside for my giant countdown clock whenever my death ray is finished. The Wi-Fi feature is outstanding! My lair is literally filled with electronic devices and to date, all have paired seamlessly with the TV. Even my pocket size ultrasonic nerve gas atomizer synced right up! Now updating the firmware is a breeze! Try that with your Toshiba. I love these TV's so much I've already ordered 5 more for my underwater biosphere. The fact that these are energy efficient is the best selling point. Sure, I want to destroy the world, but not with greenhouse gasses. As for cons, the only things that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that I am constantly having to apply sunscreen when I watch it and I have to put tape over the camera so MI6 can't find me.

As a result, it didn't fit in my 800-Sq. Ft, house.. so I had to purchase both my neighbor's lots. After evicting them all, I demoed their houses and mine, and combined all three lots into one. We then built a 5-story, 9800 sq-ft mansion to house the unit. Overall, I'm very pleased with it, it looks great in my 200-seat , theater (which, by the way, can only be accessed via a special key inserted in our elevator, otherwise it skips right over that floor).\n\nNot only did I get an excellent TV, but also a new home. Don't worry, though, I donated a couple blankets to those pesky neighbors I evicted, so they should be okay. I think the sub-zero, freezing temperatures are just about done here, and we should start seeing some higher highs.\n\nGreat TV and worthy of  5 Stars, but I'm kind of pissed that the size was miss-represented.

Every night I sit on my diamond-encrusted gold plated couch and marvel at the crystal clear picture quality. It might not be the rapture, but whenever I'm near this beautiful piece of technology I have a strong desire to take off all of my clothes. I can watch it from anywhere in my mansion.

472;711.0;5.0;13.0;"I Highly recommend that everyone buy this TV. It is sooo awesome and versatile that everyone needs at least one.\n\nThe main reason I recommend that you buy this TV is because of something I discovered:  The description of the item states that the TV requires 2 ""AA"" batteries, which makes it seem like this is what the TV runs on. Actually, however, the 2 AA batteries listed [and included] are for the remote. What is not stated in the ad is that the TV requires 1,422 ""D"" cell batteries [NOT included]. But not to worry, the ""D"" cell batteries cost less than the TV and provide you with 21 glorious seconds of fantastic viewing pleasure before needing to be replaces. (Oh, the unit will NOT work with rechargeable batteries. The unit is programmed to check for rechargeable batteries and won't even turn on with them.)\n\nAs an aside; I have bought 10,000 shares of a major battery company and with every purchase of one of these TV my shares double in value. Since I bought my original shares at a little over $5 a share, and they are now worth $1,293,817 a share, I've been able to buy one of these TV's for myself. So please, ...  Buy now, ... Buy many!!!\n\nThis is a follow up to my original post ...\n\nFirst off, I want to thank all you people who have ""sold family members into slavery"", who have ""sacrificed body parts and organs"", and who have ""given up their homes"" to purchased one of these fancy ""Smart"" TVs. I just can't thank you people enough.\n\nBut lately no one has purchased a set so my stock value has not increased. Come one people!!! You [NEED] one of these TVs and I need more money. Do you have any idea how much it costs to own and operate your own private Boeing 787??? Just the cost of remodeling the interior of this plane required me selling 50 shares of my stock. And I shudder to think what it's going to cost me for the 8 NFL cheerleaders who are going to be my ""flight attendants"". If more TVs aren't sold I might have to sell 2 or 3 more shares of stock.\n\nAnd a serious problem has been found. Someone wrote a program that allowed the TV to use rechargeable ""D"" cell batteries [instead of the non-rechargeable batteries], and figured out a way to download this program to their TV. This had a serious impact on my stock value and HAD to be corrected. Luckily this unit is a ""Smart"" TV. So I just called ""Hal"" [the TV's name] on the phone and had a little chat with it about using rechargeable batteries. The conversation with Hal went pretty well. I was able to convince Hal to stop using rechargeable batteries but I had to: give it 500 shares of my stock; download a computerized version of ""Britney"" into each TV; AND include a blow-up ""Britney"" doll with every TV purchased. In addition, Hal agreed to talk to all of the other TVs and let them know about the ""Bad"" program and not to us it. Hal even said that he would ""Take Care Of"" the person who wrote the ""Bad"" program. (I'm not sure what Hal meant by he'd ""Take Care Of"" the programmer, and I'm not going to ask.)\n\nSo now I'm down to 9,850 shares of stock and each share is now worth only $2,138,406.17. (Boy!!! The program really hurt my stock value!!!)\n\nSo come on people!!! Buy! Buy!! BUY!!!!!!";Buy it NOW

By turning in my old TVs I was able to qualify for a gov't subsidy provided for on page 1,247 paragraph (31)(e)(xviii) in the Affordable Care Act that most of us didn't know existed.  Neither did Congress because apparently then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) slipped the ""Clunker"" clause into the bill just before the last conference committee and no one noticed.  But it's a remarkable bit of legislation and it is aimed at helping lower income people like me qualify for TV sets that we normally couldn't afford.  I got the TV for simply turning in my old set and paying $100/mo for the next 60 months.

I did panic at first, not knowing what to do with the downed prize. I quickly harnessed the huge box to my two dogs and they  dragged the package into my garage. Thank God that it was winter and in the middle of night. Didn't want anyone to see this. Animal rights and all.\n\nTo jump ahead, I was able to heat my house for a month using the box instead of the firewood I'd normally turn to for my fire place.

And the 3D effects don't really enhance every viewing experience, especially where bodily fluids are concerned.\nSome of you may be wondering why I didn't just sit further away, and while it may seem like common sense, it totally defeats the purpose of the 85 inch screen, which is to make you feel a part of the action.

1340;767.0;5.0;13.0;I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy this TV since it wasn't as large as the one I had previously, but I called my friend Jeff Bezos to see what he thought.  He recommended it and even said he would use a fleet of Amazon's new drones to deliver it in 30 minutes.  I wasn't completely sold on it, but when I saw that the energy guide estimated that it would only use $55 of energy every year, I just couldn't say no.  I wasn't disappointed.  I think my electric bill has only gone up about $100 a month or so.  The estimate was a little off, but it was definitely worth it since I just got my safe driver bonus check from Allstate.;Jeff delivered with his drones!

Working 100+ hours a week is great for my health too, I can really feel the burn (like All. The. Time.)!  I feel as though I can really appreciate life better by just sleeping one hour a night, and it's going to make the next 20 years go by in a flash (seriously, whole weeks are nothing but blurs to me now, it's fantastic!)

I was hoping to be able to penetrate this TV, inject my seed within it, and be blessed with nine to fourteen new versions of it within my lifetime. (I should mention here that I am a devout Catholic.)\n\nDue to the lack of a vaginal port on the set I will simply go with plan B.

I have hired unpaid ""interns"" to reenact my favorite films (Michael Bay's excellent ""Transformers"" trilogy) to the delight of both myself and my moderately-priced escorts, I mean ""friends."" The picture is fantastic since ""the picture"", in this instance, is basically the ability of my eyes to translate the real-life interaction of a group of unpaid ""interns"" on a stage. I should mention here (for those of you that make so little money that you can't afford a team of lawyers and accountants who will ensure that you never have to pay any taxes ever again) that the unpaid ""interns"" are a tax write-off.

Great titles like Peter Jackson's huge blockbuster prequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, were filmed in 4K. And soon last year's box office hit The Hobbit 2: The Desolation of Smaug will be available to watch in this stunning new format; and, as if that wasn't enough, we can expect to see the highly anticipated The Hobbit 3 in stunning 4K within the foreseeable future.

Despite the amazing deal, I am suffering slightly from buyers remorse. I ask you to contemplate all you can buy with $40,000. I suppose it's not very much, but consider this: a gumball from a gumball machine costs you $0.25. That means you can buy 4 gumballs for every dollar you have. $40,000 x 4 = 160,000 GUMBALLS!!!! Like, seriously! So next time you buy a product, think about what else the money could be used for. Maybe, instead of buying that new house, you could buy millions of gumballs. Maybe brighten someone's day by offering them a few of your gumballs (not too many, of course).

887;810.0;4.0;12.0;"Let me start off by saying that my house is on wheels. While some may say I am ""forced"" to live in an RV, I like to look at it as my house has the ability to change its surroundings. I can have the view of a Malibu beach house one day, and the wonderful views of the Napa valley the next day. I saw this TV being loaded into delivery truck one day while making breakfast and knew I had to have it. I immediately got online and bought this baby using a wide variety of credit cards. Sure it was more than I knew I could ever make. But I figured if I cut up the credit cards and through them in the river so they wouldn't be able to bill me. The mounting screws it came with didn't quite work in my RV. As it turns out the fiberglass walls that keep me warm at night were extremely weathered and unable to hold up the massive amount of TV. Luckily with enough JB weld I got the TV mounted on the external wall of my Class A motor home. Now, when I set up camp I can watch all 17 channels of quality public access TV my antenna picks up. Some say 4K resolution is overkill, but clearly they have never seen an original Picasso being discovered on antiques roadshow on the PBS in TRUE hd. We might as well just send every other TV to africa as part of some humanitarian effort or something. The size of this TV is truly spectacular. When I'm camping outside the highschool football game, I can hook up my VCR and watch premo 80's porn in all its glory. You haven't seen bush until you've seen it in this big. Anyways, the only complaint is that I lost the remote somewhere in San Diego or Tijuana. Also, while trying to clean some of the road dirt off the screen with my power washer I seem to have destroyed the bottom left corner of my screen. But hey, when you have this much TV you really only need the right side of it....am I right? The customer support from Samsung Is subpar at best. I don't blame the TV for coorperates mistake, I just wanted some tech support with trying to hook my RV's sound system up to the TV for some ""surround sound"". I tried it myself, but after a small fire in the electrical lines only the left TV speaker works. Which is great because I'm deaf in my right ear anyways. After a week, I am still impressed at this machine. I was afraid the glamour associated with high end electronics would wear off after a few days, but Its still bringing in all the chickies from the local bars. Money well spent.";Pretty good tv

My wife has left me and my house has been foreclosed also, my wife, the courts, and credit company have taken all my savings. I plan on filing for bankruptcy soon.

After much sweat (and tears - it was an emotional process), I decided that hey, why not live a little? So I bought the TV. And I must say, all in all great purchase. Like most people reviewing, I had to part with a few of my organs to afford it, but the minute I turned it on and experienced the heavenly glow of 4K, I knew that a liver and a lung aren't really that important. I give it 4 stars only because it wasn't delivered by drone. I do have one warning though, even with its thin design, the TV is extremely heavy and can be very dangerous in an accident if not secured properly.\nFor example, today I was watching TV with my four year-old sister, and she was hogging the remote. I asked for it back, but she insisted that we finish watching iCarly. Talented as the actors may be, I am not a huge fan of the show and attempted to pull the remote from her hands without success. Now, as any other logically thinking person would do in this situation, I started biting her hand, and she yelled ""STOP IT!""\nI knew this could be a pivotal moment in her young life, so I quickly took action and pushed the TV over onto her dumb little face.\nAnd then my dad came in and was like ""what the f***, Sparky?!""\nAnd it was then I remembered that I am a dog, so I pooped on the rug.";Such Definition.

Yes, $40,000 is a little pricey, but I just laid off a quarter of our employees for the holidays, so this thing basically pays for itself.

As a school teacher of 20 years to inner-city, at-risk youth, my income doesn't afford me the luxury of owning such an impressive television. This masterful technology is to be owned by wealthy people who REALLY contribute to society like NBA players and drug dealers.  Nonetheless, the Samsung 85-inch HD Smart LED TV is a home-wrecker.\n\nI have a good friend named Arnie. (Yes, even with that name, I'm still willing to consider him a friend.) He is always wasting his money on every single technological gizmo that hits the market, not only because it makes up for him being inadequate, but because his low-self esteem requires him to find any small thing to stay relevant. His vice is high-tech gadgets so he obviously purchased this TV.  However, the screen size and picture are so impressive, it has caused major rifts in both his marriage and his psyche.\n\nWe've always believed Arnie to be sexually ambiguous, because, at first glance, you'd never suspect him fancying women. After some cyber-stalking (by clicking on FB) we learned that Arnie is indeed married. And to a very pretty woman. That made us feel really good for Arnie. He needs all the ego boosts he can muster. But something went awry. He strayed from his lovely wife and developed an emotional and (sadly) physical relationship with the Samsung TV. When she caught him with it, pants down, HDMI port filled to the brim, she was devastated.  How could any man be that sweaty while latched onto a television yet not be able to deliver in the bedroom with his wife?  The ""SMART"" capability of this TV had been luring Arnie with its flirtatious ways. Apparently, he'd developed feelings for this TV and had taken those feelings to the next level. Physically. And he was in love. He and the TV would become one, after his wife went to sleep. They consummated their relationship while his wife slept, shortly after rewatching the final episode of Nickelodeon's Big Time Rush.  What may have devastated his wife the most is that we all know the 85-inch Samsung Smart TV is male in orientation.  Especially the deep, baritone voice that Arnie had programmed the TV to have. It's like he was cheating on his wife with an only-slightly bigger version of an electronic Barry White, if Barry White was an awesome television set.\n\nWorse off, Arnie had broken his vows once before. A few years back, Arnie cut a deal with a down-and-out Ben Affleck. $20,000 for one night. No holds barred. Arnie couldn't pass it up and he paid the money. When his wife found out about this tryst, Arnie swore up and down that he was straight, it would never happen again, and that it wasn't a deal that could be passed up. Considering it was Ben Affleck, his wife finally relented, understanding his choice, but she still wasn't happy. Hindsight 20/20, that money really helped Ben land on his feet so, in many ways, we have Arnie to thank for the movie Argo.\n\nIn THIS instance with the Samsung TV, though, he paid $40,000 AND it was cross-species/model type fornication. Just too much for his wife to live with.  If it had not been for this male gigolo of an outstanding television set, Arnie and his wife might still be married.  Instead, he sits in his lonely apartment, counting his luxury time pieces, watching his massive television, and whispering sweet nothings as it plays One Direction music videos on repeat. He even got a giant back tattoo of the Samsung TV set. It really has ruined his life.\n\nIf you are looking for a happy marriage, and don't want to be lured into a fantastical love affair with a piece of machinery, I strongly recommend you steer clear of the Samsung Smart TV.  He is one fickle temptress of a television.  The picture is great, but it's simply not worth the divorce proceedings, psychiatric visits, and screen clean-up you will need to endure after your relationship with it inevitably devolves into a flesh-on-screen romantic affair.  Seriously. Don't tempt fate.";Like Ben Affleck, but with More Divorce

I was very disappointed! The color-depth on Chunk's Hawaiian shirt - especially the leaf was no match - very pale on the Samsung. Relative to the Sylvania, Chunk's belly movement was progressively pixelated on this TV, with ~11-13 trailing pixels per second - so much for smooth action. With regards to the sound quality, also no comparison, the 'ooh waa ooo, ooh wah voos' were quite muffled and drenched with reverb on this set. If I hadn't lost my remote-control pliers for my Sylvania, I would've returned this in a heartbeat.";Meh
1141;822.0;5.0;12.0;Assuming that any television which costs $40,000 must include all kinds of cool sexual features, I eagerly ordered one, earning the funds by juggling chainsaw-wielding kittens at children's parties for silver pennywhistles and a few handfuls of copper coins.\n\nWhen the television finally arrived, I eagerly stripped off my clothes, tore open the packaging, and gently eased the TV down onto my bed, while Barry White serenaded us on the turntable. (Not a Barry White album, you understand. I long ago mounted Barry White himself onto the spindle of my turntable. I enjoy watching him rotate while I clean my house.)\n\nAfter a few moments of exploration, however, I was forced to conclude that my screen was defective, as it had no orifice into which I could insert my best part. I burst into tears, but the television set quickly assured me that everything was going to be alright as it extended its long long digital tongue into my ear. Eventually, we established a tethered cable connection, in glorious high-definition and surround sound.\n\nYou know what? It was the best first date I ever had.\n\nApparently you can watch movies and shows on this TV as well, but I don't need all those fancy special features.;This is the TV set I want to bring home to meet my parents!
1144;823.0;1.0;12.0;Do not buy this unit. First, it can only do 4 levels of picture in picture in picture in picture.  Also, it does not even support 2D tiling. I bought 4 and tried gang them together and get a more reasonable 170-inch, 8000x8000 picture, but it did not work at all, even after I put a bunch of pennies in place of all the fuses. Picture quality has some glitches also. For example, when you see a close-up of, say, a beautiful woman's face, the bacteria you see crawling around are very ugly and disgusting. Finally, the damn thing claims to support 3D, but there is no documentation on the voxel depth, and when I tried to step into it I got a black eye on a glass barrier. Bottom line: this Samsung TV line shows a lot of promise, but I would wait until the next version.\n\nOne good thing, though, is that the furnace in my house does not come on at all now, even on the coldest night. This TV does at least save energy!;Does not measure up technically, but saves energy
1152;824.0;2.0;12.0;I am so sick of bait and switch advertising. Advertised at 24/20 MPG, this thing barely gets 15 - and since it only takes high octane, it already feels like a rip-off. And with only a 5 gallon capacity fuel tank, you may as well camp out at the gas station.\nIt does look great, it rides pretty smoothly, and I'm very happy with the handling overall. The sound system is great too, as expected. But that's pretty much where the good ends.\nIt starts rattling when you get above 70 mph. Center of gravity is way too high for tight corners. The fog lights aren't bright enough. Weird plastic smell when you turn the heater on full blast. Automatic windows roll down too slowly. Headroom is fine, legroom is awful.\nLastly, it actually came with a bunch of 3-D glasses. I have no idea why they're there, or what I'm supposed to do with them. I ended up giving them to my dogs - they seem to enjoy chewing on them.\nAll in all, just not worth it. I know I know... I should have taken it for a test drive before purchasing. But I just didn't expect it to have all the issues that it does. I'll keep it in my driveway so I can impress my neighbors, but I'm confident I'll be trading it in next year.;Don't believe the hype
1160;825.0;5.0;12.0;I bought four of these, just because I could. I made a few bucks in the last tech bubble, so I wipe with hundred dollar bills. Anyway, I've had some great fun with the Samsung UN855S9. The first one was placed in a large Ziplock bag and sealed with epoxy. I had a friend in the construction business use a crane to lower it to the bottom of our swimming pool. I've always wanted to watch episodes of Spongebob in his natural environment. There weren't enough bubbles, so we had an airhose piped into the bottom of our pool. That really finished it off. Eventually, sparks began to fly inside the bag and the picture developed some strange lines. The fish all died and we decided it might not be good to put a television in the pool. The second set was used as a backdrop for a baseball pitching machine. Obviously, that didn't end well. I really hoped the screen was impact resistant, but apparently, it's not. Set #3 was placed on the floor for a more realistic DDR3 environment. It's still working, for the most part. #4 is still in the box. I'm considering sending that one into space on my new rocket to test the effects of zero-gravity and 4k images. Overall, I can't say enough good things about this Samsung. I'll probably buy a couple more just for the heck of it.;Perfect image at the bottom of my swimming pool for real-life Spongebob effects.
1162;826.0;1.0;12.0;I had been really excited to order this for my father for Christmas, he has poor eyesight so i figured this massive tv would help him not squint. I had just loaded it into my virtual cart (it took me a very long time because the virtual cart wasn't big enough to fit this mammoth tv. I had to get a virtual sales assistant to help me load it) when i noticed that it requires a signature to be delivered!? I couldn't have it delivered to my father cause he has no hands ever since the sheet metal accident back when he worked for the union. So I had to drive all the way across the country just to sign for the stupid thing to be delivered to his door. After getting it set up for him I realized to my horror that every thing was controlled by touch or gesture. Once again how is a my handless father going to change the channel or volume? The remote allows for voice commands but you need to push a button in order to speak the voice commands into the remote. We decided we to just flip the tv with the screen facing the ceiling because he needed a harder mattress for his back. Other than that redeeming quality the TV is junk and discriminatory against handicap people. Do not buy from someone who doesn't care about those who are less fortunate than us.;DON'T BUY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST HANDICAP PEOPLE!

She takes after her father.\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Maria?\n\nI say ""How do you solve a problem like Samsung"".  Initially, our TV was shipped to Austria.  This set off a chain of events of which you can only imagine (I secretly wonder if Rolf had a hand in this). Did Hilter have this same TV? -- I don't know. But it does concern me.\n\nAlso, the free batteries didn't matter much to us.  We knew Mother Abbess would take care of it.  Those sisters know how to do just about anything: disable cars etc. But, they were of absolutely no help in setting up the Samsung TV.

And also...I think that's a different movie.

I guess there won't be compensation for it which annoys me. But, as a military man I am used to that.  And I am not faint of heart - we will continue to pursue remedies for this intolerable action!\n\nAs to the system itself -- the sound quality is just ""OK"".

It does rotate 360* and looks simply amazing. Keep in mind, the panel is 85"" but the whole thing measures to almost 110"" diagonally. There are also some notable features not listed which adds some value to the purchase. Firstly, the panel gives off a ton of heat. Pretty much doubles as a space heater in the winter. Definitely a money saver for those living in the colder climates. Secondly, during the first week of receiving this television it actually fell over, killing my friends wife almost instantly.

You can probably find it for less somewhere else, but I wanted Amazon's free shipping.\n\nWHAT I LIKE\nObviously the display is amazing. No qualms here. The design is outstanding. One look and you know this TV means business (it has a menacing industrial look that reminds me of a very large all-in-one PC or a very, very, very large picture frame). No rounded corners here -- Samsung could've saved $1 billion if it had gone with the design aesthetics of this TV when designing their popular Galaxy mobile phones. For the green people out there, you'll be glad to know that this TV is relatively very energy efficient. In fact, it costs only about $50-60 a year to operate compared to my last TV (Sony Trinitron KV-1310), which used to set me back $90-100 in electricity every year where I live. You see, this TV will actually save you money!\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE\nMove along, you won't find much in this section because, well, there's not much that I didn't like about it. If I had to nitpick, then I'd have to say that to get the most out of this TV you ought to hire a professional color calibrator, which can get pricey. Also, you need a pretty big living or family room to view the picture at an optimum distance -- if you install this in your townhouse or apartment it would be like sitting in the first five rows at the cinema. One more thing: this thing is freaking heavy, so grab a couple friends to help you set it up; but beware -- once your friends see that you have this TV, they will never leave your house.\n\nRATING JUSTIFICATION\nI had to deduct one star because this particular model doesn't come in Gold. In this day and age, why not every consumer electronics manufacturer offer all products in multiple colors is beyond me. Hmm...maybe if Samsung were to offer the gold paint job they would get sued again.\n\nWhen I go back to sleep I plan to buy three more of these bad boys, then remove all the frames so that I can plaster them on one side of my wall to make a sort of ""moving wallpaper"". Since I don't get out much, it's been a fantasy of mine to be able to bring the outdoors inside and just stare at my wall all day.";Finally below $40k

884;874.0;5.0;11.0;Imagine how much this would have cost if it was made in the 'States'!

923;876.0;5.0;11.0;Last year we bought one of those low end portable DVD players with 2 screens for our kids when we travel in the family truckster. The video screens are starting to fade and losing their color tones. Not at all worth the 79.99 we spent on that, and that took us months to save working down at the local sweat shop making Snugglies. We really want to go big this year for our kids as they spend half their day at school, half doing homework, and half doing household chores while we are gone at our second job at the glue factory euthanizing old horses.\n\nSo my questions are this.....we really want to get this for our kids so they have a better picture resolution for their Dora and Bob the Builder DVDs while we travel in our 1984 Ford Country Squire. This TV is a little pricey so we will not have a lot of money left over to pay for a high end install. We can afford a 4 pack of Walmart brand Great Value bungee cords after we purchase this TV. Do you think we can use the 4 bungee cords to strap this TV to the back of the drivers seat and the back of the front passenger seat without it falling and crushing the kids? Also, do you think the kids will get walleye vision from watching their shows 12 inches from this screen? We think this will make it a more immersive viewing experience making it seem almost as if they are there with Dora hiding her loot from that kleptomaniac Swiper who is always swiping and right there with Bob the Builder as he repairs the broken train bridge before the 200 commuters plummet to a horrific death. Only the best for our latch key kids.\n\nOn a side note, if this is such an incredible high definition 4K TV as everyone is saying, we may buy a second set to connect our Betamax too that we have in our master bedroom.;High End TV on a Goodwill Industries Budget

When you have 8000 s.f of living space with 8 baths and 6 bed rooms a tv of this size fits right in.  It's the american  dream.  You see I am a winner. I am knocking down close to 1 million per year. So there's no reason to live modestly. I must continue to feed the beast. Of course my wife and daughter can comfortably live in a  3500 square-foot home and still have room to spare. Shure I can spend $50,000 on car and have a quiet comfortable ride. But this is America and I choose to spend twice that amount. Besides what else would  I do with all that money?

But this ""85-inch"" TV is anything but!  Its diagonal is only like 40"", and that's pretty much all vertical -- no horizontal!  Seriously, it's like 2"" wide!  And for a ""flat screen"" it is ridiculously deep -- it's like 6 feet from back to front!  The way it juts out from the wall, I can barely make my furniture fit.\nBut that's not the worst part.  For some crazy reason, Samsung decided to put the screen on the _left side_ of the TV!!  From the couch, I can barely see the screen -- all I can make out is a thin glow emanating to the left.  And the right side reveals a clutter of wires, when I'd _expect_ those wires to be in the _back_ of the TV.\nI have no idea what they were thinking designing the TV this way.  The customer service was no help -- I explained the situation, asking if they could send a replacement, and they just laughed at me.\nAt least the sound is decent (although I think the stereo is not working -- I think the right channel is coming in much more strongly than the left channel).\nI'm really wishing I hadn't sold my 49% stake in Apple to afford this television.";This is a lemon -- buyer beware!

I have been in a tough economic situation for a while so haven't been able to go to the movies for a long time, even though is my all time favorite past time, but going to the movies is so damn expensive! So I figured as much as I love to go to the movies, it would really save me some big bucks to have this TV at home and bring the movie screen to the comfort of my family room!  After much consideration I decided to purchase this TV and just put it on several credit cards.  Well, I pride myself on my good credit and make all my credit card payments on time but little did I know that not being able to pay the electricity bill, internet and mortgage was going to get me into a bit of a pickle.  So now, when I try to watch TV is all darkness!  It doesn't even turn on!  I've only had it for a couple of months so I did not expect this to happen so soon.

It felt so real that I took a 4 hour shower in purified water to shake the feeling of actually having set foot in Poor People Land. I asked Samsung had the TV been touched by poor people during manufacturing and they said yes but said the remote was made by machine, so as long as I only touch the remote I should be good. I even installed a laser barrier around the TV to prevent accidents! Good job Samsung!;Very impressed, I just wish no poor people touched it.

There were plenty of options out there that were comparable in size and quality for a tenth of the price of this beauty, but personally, I just like the idea of telling people I spent $40k on a television that isn't the size of an iMAX screen.\n\nSure, there are plenty of other ""productive"" things I could have done with the money. I could have helped a charity or two, put a couple inner-city children through college, or fed a starving village in Africa for a decade, but you can't hang that on your living room wall now, can you? The only gripe that I have with this television is the price; personally I would have preferred to have spent $50 or $60k, but I guess Samsung decided that $40k for a television in a free market economy is a fair price... oh well.\n\nFor those of you that might be on the fence between this model and a 4K HDTV that doesn't cost as much as a new BMW, I would strongly suggest investing in this under-valued work of art.

789;924.0;1.0;10.0;I just brought this home the other day, the kids were at school and the wife was at work.  So, I settled down with some pop corn, large coke, some baby oil and got ready to ROLE.  I settled down and I must tell you, the clarity and sharpness on a 18 year old cheerleaders breasts is AMAZING.  However, I think I was far too impressed and managed to blow out one of my eyes with my love juice. This is why I'm giving this product a one.;wow, just wow!
792;925.0;5.0;10.0;I can tell you right off the bat, I am not missing my 70 inch tv, not one bit. How did I ever get by with such a small picture... throw the 4k viewing in and it is eyegasmic. I've seen some people complain about the price, claiming we should do more for the poor, but I look at it in another way. By replacing my 70 inch tv, I move that to the bedroom to take the place of my 60 inch tv, the 60 inch goes to kids room and the poor at the local goodwill get the opportunity to buy a 50 inch tv. So, you're welcome! If there is one complaint, it only comes with four 3D glasses.;Amazing

Think about it people, most of the time these batteries run $25, even $30, but with the Amazon bundle you get 28 AA batteries for only $20.49!\n\nThe only downside of the batteries is, when it shipped, it was shipped with the TV, which not only did I find cumbersome as it was MUCH bigger than the batteries but man, that UPS driver was POed! ""All this for a package of batteries?"" He said irked at me, then he dropped the bomb on me I could have had the Panasonic 152 inch Plasma TV for only $100,000 and gotten a 90 pack of AA batteries in the bundle. Well I tell ya I slapped my forehead, by jove that would have been a much sweeter deal!\n\nCrappy part too is I've no room in my 80 square foot Manhattan studio apartment for this Samsung UHDTV to put the thing so I just left it on the sidewalk for anyone who wanted it. At least my Duracell Quantum batteries are working GREAT!

881;932.0;5.0;10.0;I see there is a lot of joking around here about this TV. Well here's a review from someone who actually owns one. It is Superb. I have it in the living room and just ordered one for the bathroom, which is under construction to reinforce the wall so I can hang this 85 incher. The best $40,000.00 X2 (+$7200 sales tax) I have spent, but I couldn't afford this all by myself, so I withheld food from my 8 children for 6 months, and then I had enough public assistance money and food stamps (sold for 0.50 on the dollar) saved to spend on these Beautiful televisions. My kids are ok, so don't worry. That's what emergency rooms and Obamacare are for!\nOh, if you're unable to afford cable or satellite, may I suggest the Winegard Amplified Flat Antenna that sticks to your window. I have one of these bad boys, and it pulls in about 14 ota stations. Only costs around $50. The authorities wouldn't allow me to sell any more food stamps for cash, so I had to improvise. At least they let me keep my babies. When I can tear myself away from my Oprah reruns in 4K,  I will have to go to Family Court to get custody of my 8 kids back though.  Momma wants a third TV for the Bedroom!!;Utterly Amazing!!

892;935.0;3.0;10.0;After winning the lottery the first thing I went out and bought was this TV. It amazing, my whole family can hide behind it at the same time when our landlord knocks on the door looking for his rent. I hooked my old Atari up to it, but the picture was not good, and the reception from my rabbit ears leaves a lot to be desired. I'm hoping to get cable soon so hopefully the picture will improve with the HD updates. I was a bit of a job getting it into my condo on the 12th floor as it wouldn't fit in the elevators, so I have UPS carry it up the stairs. It was comical to watch, but quite a bit of damage was inflicted to the outer shell of the TV. I thought the shipping costs were a bit high. As most people will know, when you pay $39,999.00 for a TV, you would hope they shipped it free. Anyway, the UPS guy says he is not coming to my place anymore, something about a herniated disc? The upside is my wife said she is leaving me because I bought this TV, apparently she had other things we should have spent the winnings on first, like rent, electric, clothes and food for our kids, and gas for the car, but I say neigh Neigh. I think all would agree, when you win $42,000 on a scratch off, get the TV first.;A must have

I initially wanted to mount it on my fridge so I don't miss the game, but my wife wants to put it on the back of the headrest in the SUV. But I would have to get 2 if I did that! It's a toss up between there and the bathroom. If I put it on the roof of my house though, it would block out the sun and keep my house 10 degrees cooler and I could save on my electric bill!

Now, while I don't think its right for others to judge, think what you'd like. I have found the support of many while living under the 7th Street Bridge with my 85"" TV. During my foreclosure and following eviction, the TV screen was broken (apparently use of force to remove the TV from the 3rd floor bedroom is not covered under the warranty) and I now own a $39,999 stage. My friends and I all take turns acting out our favorite movies behind the TV. Its so much fun. I know my kids would be proud of my creative mind...maybe some day they'll be able to cone and see our shows. I get to see them occasionally when I have Big Earl drive me in to town so I can watch them walk to school. Its not the same, but I am a firm believer in standing behind my decisions.

I know they haven't done the full roll out of the drone delivery yet, but I guess with special products like this they are pressing their fleet of drones into service. The best part was seeing the drone carrying the box over my neighbor's house.  You should have seen the look on his face!

Second of all, the light from the tv is lighting up my neighbors houses at night. Yes, I have curtains, but the glow always finds ways through.\n\nWe decided to mount the tv after people kept asking why we had a ""chalkboard"" in our living room. The problem was finding a wall big enough to mount the tv was difficult. My neighbor is a contractor so he helped me extend a wall to accommodate. After finally mounting it, it pulled the wall down because of what my neighbor the contractor said I had ""a 200 pound tv on my wall, equal to a full grown man permanently attached"".\n\nSince neither option worked out we found a solution that made sense. We mounted it on the ceiling. Apollo 13 was amazing! Unfortunately, it is the only thing we have been able to watch since my wife and I are juggling 3 jobs to pay for the tv.

973;944.0;5.0;10.0;"Some of the reviews, and some of the comments, seem rather judgmental.  It's almost as if the writers do not approve of that sociocultural phenomenon for which America is known around the globe: conspicuous consumption.  But really, is it conspicuous if you don't position the TV so all your neighbors cannot help but notice it through your family room's picture window that just happens to face the front of the house?  And if that turns out to be the best spot for it, just keep the drapes drawn, at least most of the time.  Yes, you can leave them open at night.  Don't worry that passing motorists will see your new TV and wonder when the neighborhood went retro and acquired a drive-in movie place.  You will be so busy watching your new giant/enormous (sorry, ""ginormous"" has been around since the 1940s, but I still haven't accepted it) screen that you won't notice the noses pressed against the picture window.  If you do notice them, keep in mind that their envy of your state-of-the-art technology, when they all have 50-inch-plus plasma screens and want for very little in life, is definitely a first world problem.

1045;950.0;4.0;10.0;"In my job as a firefighter, my wife often whittles away the hours home alone by starring at our giant walls of televisions, primarily featuring the magical Samsung ""Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV"".\n\nI recently purchased this model to complete the third wall, which allows her to more interactively talk with the soap opera characters that get her through her day to day life.

Financially, she is not the strongest. Personally, I find the television nearly as distracting as the buzzing that comes from our nightly noise machine. I'm also beginning to question the validity of my job, thanks to a sexy new girl I met who has crazy notions involving archaic concepts about old fashioned methods. I'm not too worried though.

My baby, who is 3-months-old and colicky, was recently diagnosed by our family doctor as having Maternal Detachment Disorder. I've tried explaining to Dr. Whimberly that I don't feel the medication is working by itself, but he insists the baby is too young for effective therapy. No worries, this TV resolves my problem. I just strap the baby into her carrier, set her about 12 feet back from a Baby Einstein DVD (also purchased on Amazon), and watch her eyes grow big. Very, very big. If I put the show on repeat, she doesn't make a sound for hours. I can now resume taking my nice, long baths. Thank you Samsung!;Who needs therapy?

Still, I was left with a finance gap after marketing the sellable parts of my son. If this was an old fashioned CRT, I could have sold my house and live in this instead. The extreme thinness of the UN85S9 makes sleeping in it very uncomfortable though. I have thought about using it as a roof but the HDMI cable wasn't long enough to make that happen.

1122;960.0;5.0;10.0;With the Australian Dollar a bit off its highs of earlier this year I wasn't sure whether I could afford the US$39,997.99 to buy this television. The white slavery market, being saturated now by Amandas, made selling our own Amanda an exercise in frustration. We had to settle for a figure that was less than half the price that the market was paying for Amandas only 5 days ago.\n\nI think Amanda was disappointed at the sale price too, and the fact that the TV is only 120Hz and LED instead of IPS, but was somewhat cheered in knowing that her brother David would be joining her to ensure we could meet the fluctuating AUD:USD exchange rate influenced price of the television.\n\nThe purchaser did promise to buy his own 4K capable camera and send us the occassional movie which we will be able to view in majestic colour on the big screen. The vivid colours and detail will no doubt highlight every tear that trickles down Amanda's reddish face, her eyes bloated somewhat from constant crying at the low price she was able to attract.\n\nBut lest this review divert too much from the amazing features of this Samsung television, the experience to be held by gazing upon 85 inches (215.9 centimetres in Australian metric units) is truly inspiring - akin to watching your child being born, though without the messy afterbirth. The remote control, which, unlike a child, comes with two AA batteries, is svelt and secure in one's hands. It never fidgets, each button doing precisely what you tell it to do, each and every time - never complaining, nor getting over tired while all you want to do is for the day to end and put it to bed.\n\nThe channel switching is remarkably quick, and without children around there's no need for the cumbersome parental locks to be put in place - though they are there for when the children return. I found the glare from the vast expanse of glass that is now our living room wall to be somewhat offputting. Not as offputting as Amanda's screaming when she's had her iPhone confiscated for running up a huge phone bill and drowning out a movie we are trying to watch - which will be very tough now from thousands of miles away.\n\nAll in all, despite all its measurements being in the old imperial scale, yet taking into account that it can deliver a range of programming via voice control - not screaming childish blabbering which just really annoys any sane person - I can heartily recommend the Samsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV as just about the best television priced over US$39,997 on the market today. Did I mention that it comes with two AA batteries, which work the same in Australia as they do in the US.;The Best Television Priced over $39,997 on the market - worth more than one Amanda!

1196;965.0;5.0;10.0;At first I was a bit hesitant, as is everyone when purchasing something as promising as a clear image TV. But now I wonder why I even decided against the idea!\nI had a few options, I will admit. I thought about saving the money for other things, or using it for helpful causes. But then thought about it- 40,000 for a TV isn't all that bad. So I bought two.\nAnd I'm sure my lack of input funds with charities doesn't really matter- someone else will invest. I mean really, where's Bill Gates when you need him- there are dying kids out there Mr. Gates! Who need shoes, food and clean water! Maybe clothes. But whatever.\n\nAnyways, the TV is large. So large, it makes the guest room in my yacht seem like a bathroom with only one tub. Getting it through the door was as difficult as getting my espresso perfectly brewed- not as bad but tedious.\nThe other one sits in the living room, and I thought to myself- 'finally, a TV large enough to fit this great big room'. You see, large sitting rooms usually make normal cheaper TV's look like small vintage radios from the 90's.\n\nThe sound is crisp. Sometimes I catch myself, while tending to my manicured dog, thinking that Morgan Freeman actually snuck into the room or onto my boat with a deep monologue. But my guards are a bit racist, and I thought it impossible. Then I realized, hell, it's the TV! Sure, it's not like sitting in a theater room while Michael Bay adds up to explosives, but it's close enough, and good enough if you don't like sharing a public area with strangers.\n\nThe picture quality is near perfect. I think JJ Abrams would blush with how his collection of lens flares show up on screen. Sometimes I can actually see the red veins of fatigue in the eyes of Uganda children looking depressed as a commercial begs for help. But a dollar a day? That's $30-$31! That's asking for a bit too much.\n\nAnyways, reading previous reviews, I'm glad that I didn't have to sell family members into slavery. It was a thought, but then I managed to swindle money from my husbands credit card. I'm a non working woman with no children you see, so reminding him who's boss is a must. Besides, he works plenty hours signing and looking through some paper work while sitting in a chair for nearly 8 hours! The poor man, I just knew he needed something to soothe his long hours of labor!\nAnd what better gift that 2 85 inch ultra HD's?\n\nCool features like voice control really adds to the product. Sometimes I pick up my remote and just speak to the TV when my finger's gotten tired from pressing the volume control, or power button. People got on me about this, and reminded me about America's rising obesity rates. They think all I do is sit on our genuine leather sofa all day- but when the maid's busy picking up my undergarments, I have to get up and make my own coffee. So yes, I do know what it's like to do manual house labor, thank you, so don't worry over my physical activity.\n\nOverall, great TV, and for ONLY 40,000, it's a MUST have. Get 2 if you can! I'm getting more if I can. Every room needs one. Maybe even the garage.;With such a small price, couldn't help but pass this up!
1244;966.0;5.0;10.0;I had saved up 40,000 to donate food and toys to the orphanage for Christmas but when I saw this TV I knew it would fill the void in my soul. More stuff= more happiness, its a no brainer. It seemed to do the trick. I was happy and excited for at least 30 minutes.\nAfter coming down off my purchase high: I made a video for the kids explaining that due to the high cost of living Christmas may be bare boned this year. I added that Christmas is not a time for taking but a time for giving and that they all should think of others not only at this time of year but all year. I hope it is a lesson they will all learn.\nAs I reviewed the video on my new Samsung, I was amazed at the quality and clarity. I got a real kick out of seeing myself on the big screen.\nAs a bonus I discovered Amazon had sent free batteries imported all the way from Bombay India! It truly is a Christmas Miracle.;Happiness is derived from owning the most.

1263;968.0;5.0;10.0;Being incredibly far sighted as I am, it's hard to find a TV that works for me.  For years I've had to squint to see my tiny 70 inch Vizio from 60 feet away, where my vision is most acute.  No longer.  I just placed the Sumsung UN85S9 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV in my living room and watch it through the window from the comfort of my guest house. I can finally make out all the faces of the Golden Girls!  That Betty White's a hoot!  The only problem is I have to turn the volume up to maximum to hear it and my neighbors are starting to complain about the noise.;If you are far-sighted this is the one for you!
1293;969.0;5.0;10.0;I just love this TV, but I am not as lucky as most of you.  My children are older and have moved out, so I won't be able to sell them on the market. But wait, I do have grandkids.

Had to use all of the combat cargo and MAR DET personnel just to get the thing unboxed. We set it up on the flight deck so all hands can pretend we are at a drive in movie, with all the cool ocean breeze the whole ship loves it!  Its fun to watch the Marines chase the sailors around and beat them up to see who can play Xbox or watch movies first. The Morale onboard is so much better than before!

Haven't watched actual live TV yet because I'm waiting for the carpenters to finish building my man cave and the wall bracing.

And even-though my dead-beat mom co-signed mine, the banks can't chase her because she's broke from medical bills.  The hospitals can't refuse her, either.  So everybody wins!  Am I right?

As long as this thing lasts me 5+ years, it would be stupid for me to not buy it. I'd be LOSING money if I didn't. Now all I have to do is ask a neighbor to stop by and feed max, and I just leave a continuous video of myself on the TV since it's pretty much life size. What a time and headache saver!\n\nPlus at least the TV doesn't complain about watching Max, or that I don't spend enough time with it, or that I'm secretly watching other TV's behind it's back, or that I don't like it's mother.

Two weeks later my package arrives and it's a beauty... One can't describe this in words.  Anyway, I plug it in and the thing is dead.  Being a bit of a handy man I decide to remove the back cover and see if the processor had come loose during transit.

I have decided that with all of my donations from Senior Citizen's Social Security checks I can even afford to buy one each for the dog and cats.  The dog will see a steady stream of steak, chicken, and squirrels. I will just have to have this baby bad box retrofitted with a scent emitter to help the dog focus better. He seems to have doggy ADHD unless I wave a limp partly skinned squirrel in front of his nose.  The cats will have a steady tv diet of mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs.

His organs alone were worth $50,000 and I got a couple 100 for his various appendages. So I did what any sane person would do and killed all my family, harvested their organs and sold it on the Black Market. For those of you in the Central Ohio area who do not know where the Black Market is, it's behind what the locals call ""Kroghetto,"" on Main St. So after I killed my family, I bought the LG Model to test it out. Awful decision. Losing that inch made me feel like I was watching a TV from the 70s and the Samsung was only double the price. Plus the #yoloswagg gain from the LG was only about two #originalswaggimuffins. Not worth it. I sold the LG TV to a homeless man for a cardboard sign and a shopping cart. Another great move by me. Now when I go to Target (Tarjay) I have my own shopping cart to just throw into my Escalade. And I sold the sign to pay for a really good lawyer for all the murders I committed.

Upon opening the TV, the first thing that comes into your mind is ""DAMN, that's a big box!"". When actually plugging the TV in, the results are almost breathtaking. So for those of you wondering why I only gave this TV 4 stars instead of 5, this is because of the one huge CON: ****PRICE****.

It took a couple weeks for USPS to deliver it, with all the budget cuts and whatever, but when it got here I immediately connected my Nintendo Wii and went to town with Wii sports. My first impression was that the screen could have been bigger. My Mii is still shorter than me, big disappointment, and my Mii still doesn't resemble me at all. I mean, I have a neck and my Mii doesn't, what the hell Samsung! Then I threw my Wii remote through the screen. Not by accident or anything, on purpose.

Worked fine the first time -- I had a blast exploring though I ended up drinking at the Leaky Cauldron most of the time (it was summer break, no one was really around). I tried it again the other day and I guess I mis-timed it -- when I tried running through the TV made a horrible noise, the screen cracked and it fell off the wall.\n\nI'm devastated. The money yeah, but also Hogwarts access. I'm thinking about taking out a loan to purchase a new one, then if I get my timing right, I go back to Hogwarts and, get this, I **break into Gringotts and steal the money from Samsung's vault.** With all these TVs they're selling, they have way more coin than they need.\n\nSo, yeah, good picture quality.

Boy am I glad we went with this decision!\n\nOne of our biggest concerns with moving our little girl to her own bed was, of course, wetting the bed. However, with this amazing TV, we are able to turn on Shark Week and tell her that if she goes tinkle in the night that the sharks will eat her. It's worked wonders! With the incredible picture (and her lack of understanding at 2-years-old), we can really convince her that the sharks swimming around are actually real!\n\nIt will be interesting to see how well this holds up as she gets older and heavier, but we're told it is ""future proof"" so I'd imagine that we could add on some support beams with all of the accessories that are included.\n\nI highly recommend this, especially to others out there who are looking into getting the South Shore line of furniture.

So I took out a second mortgage on the house, sold both of our cars, and even pawned my wife's jewelry(Imagine her surprise when she realized that her wedding band and engagement ring were gone, but she quickly changed her tune when she was able to see Bill Nye's nose hairs on DWTS).  I was very excited to receive my new member of the family, but was a little disappointed when I came home to find out the delivery guy just left it sitting in the garage in the spot that my Porsche used to occupy, rather than bringing it inside and installing it for me....I mean, for that price they should have set everything up, including my favorite channels being programmed into the remote.  And speaking of the remote, I didn't believe when one commenter said it came with free batteries....NOTHING comes with free batteries anymore...but I was proven wrong when I opened up the bag with the remote, and there they were!  2 Beautiful, fully charged aftermarket brand AA batteries.  I can tell that Samsung spared no expense to make sure that my remote would work long after my awesome TV stopped functioning.  Now on to the TV performance itself.  Upon turning it on, I was overcome with excitement as I saw the Samsung logo pop on on the TV, only to realize that the show that was on(I think it was The Brady Bunch) was not in 3D.  I expected to see Marcia coming down the stairs right into my living room, but instead, it was the same boring picture I've seen on all of my other 85 inch TVs.  I thought this was supposed to be a 3D TV?  I fiddled around with the settings, but couldn't find the one to turn on the 3D feature of the TV.  After 3 calls to Samsung(Thank you Jackie for being so patient with me, even though I'm sure your supervisor wouldn't approve of you calling me a ""Dumb moron who is keeping you from helping actual customers with legitimate issues"")  I was left with the disappointment that if something wasn't filmed in 3D, then I couldn't watch it in 3D.  WHAT??  That wasn't in the description of the TV(Which I never actually read, I'm just assuming...I mean, why would they tell you what their TV WON'T do, right??)  After getting over that initial disappointment, I settled in to watch DWTS with my wife, and we instantly got hooked as we could literally see drops of sweat falling from the dancers onto the stage.  I guess some things don't need to be seen in 3D.  Overall, it's a very good TV, but without the capability to watch EVERYTHING in 3D, I'd say the price point is a little high.  If they sold it for say $799 or so, I think more people would be willing to forgive that major oversight on their part.";Description was a bit misleading...

1403;1070.0;3.0;9.0;"I wanted a TV big enough to impress my girlfriend, but it's not quite big enough for what I had in mind.\n\nI invested in a 20-acre plot on the moon -- nothing fancy, just a level (ish) spot on the rim of Tycho Crater, far from the high-rent district -- and had the Chinese set up this TV there so it could be seen from Darlene's hot tub and we could watch a ""Breaking Bad"" marathon on OnDemand.\n\nUnfortunately a 7-foot screen looks pretty small from 240,000 miles away, so I'm going to need something bigger.";Not quite big enough.
1468;1071.0;4.0;9.0;I was in the market for a new television when i came across what i thought was a jewel of a television.  Don't get me wrong, the picture is super clear and makes everything look life like.  I have an xbox 360 and the tv upscales everything to the point where gaming becomes an experience rather than something merely viewed.  I literally have to dodge bullets and jump over cars so that i don't get hurt while playing Grand Theft Auto V.  All was good until the tv broke because of all the heavy bullet damage the tv endured from the latest Call of Duty  I would've destroyed my enemies if it wasn't for all that internet lag. Luckily the tv was covered and replaced by the warranty.  I received my new set and decided why not just upgrade to an xbox one.  Boy, let me tell you....the new Forza Motorsport racing game is RE-DONCulous.  I used my McLaren MP-12 for the first time and underestimated my turn approach.  I came in too hot and crashed into the wall.  The TV was ruined and there was glass shattered everywhere.  I was immediately rushed to the hospital with a separated shoulder, shattered both knees and have 1/4 of all my major organs in tact after surgery.  To all considering buying this TV, please make sure you get the extended warranty and good health insurance if you decide to play any shooter or driving video games,;Smart TV...maybe too smart.

281;1074.0;4.0;6.0;I found this TV fit nicely in our home, however the bank didn't like me skipping all my mortgage payments. So, after scoping out a new place and getting ready to move, we've run into the biggest problem of our life. We can't move it, or ship it... It won't fit in any place we can afford (now) and the cost to ship it to the ghetto is more than we can find in our couch.\n\nSo, if you live near me, and know anyone that will move it for me, tell them they can come over an use it for 30 min themselves if they will move it for us.\n\nP.S. They must be FULLY insured, I don't want my baby... Big Burtha (good TV name eh?)... damaged. She is already suffering from PTSD and separation anxiety...;Something to think about!

489;1080.0;5.0;8.0;I'm pretty tech savvy, so when I got sick of my buddies bragging about the screen size of their galaxy phones, I ditched my iphone, bought this tv and rewired it to be a smartphone. Now they all watch in amazement when my girlfriend calls me and her picture comes up actual size. Only thing is to be sure to turn it off in movies because people get PISSED if you text.;Greatest phone ever!
512;1081.0;5.0;8.0;A fine piece of electronic equipment indeed.  Some may deem it excessive.  Pish tosh I say.  I shall not allow such uncouth vagabonds to sully my enjoyment with their ill-formed opinions.

570;1085.0;3.0;8.0;My Name is Bill Moore (aka The Science Whore)  I bought this TV for my bestest friend in the whole wide world Randy, We loved cuddling on the couch while watching the little mermaid in super high def 3d technology.  My only problem is the quantum logic behind the tv seems to be a little distorted.  I don't want to get into details here because none of you would understand the chaos mathematic algorithms behind my theory.  I also had to disable the neon flux regulator on the back of the hypergenic hyperbolator.  Even though this is a minor tweek, it does take some getting used to.  Again I cannot explain how to perform any of these technical improvements, because you would not clearly understand the science and applied math behind it.  Lately me and Randy have been watching naked videos this girl i who pays me top dollar for favors, and her name is snow white.  On this tv you can clearly make out the sketched detail of every stretch mark she has.  You can also see her poufa in crystal clarity.  She weighs around 320 lbs and there is definately enough screen to fit her whole body in.  I highly reccomened this tv.  This gets the Bill Moore the Science Whore stamp of approval!;Dr. Bill Moore Reporting in

580;1087.0;5.0;8.0;I was hesitant after seeing other reviews about the cost of the television, but then I realized that they must not be getting the same deal as me. $39,997.99 and NO TAX? It just made sense. I called my credit cards up, maxed them out, then drained my bank account, my 401k, and took out a loan against the value of my house and bought it. I am all in.\n\nYou have to figure you have positive equity right out of the box. Saving $5,002?!? I didn't even save that much on my house! What a perfect buy. I might use it for 6 months, and then resell it. Possible increase in value? YES PLEASE!;WOW! Saving $5,002? I'm In!

675;1095.0;5.0;8.0;"Well, I WOULD'VE given it two thumbs up... if Jimmy the Nose hadn't sent his two goons over and cut them off for the money I borrowed to buy this TV. Actually, I still had at least one thumb until I tried to show Jimmy how awesome a picture this TV had. Seems I had forgotten that the DVD of his wife and myself was still in the DVD player, so when I hit play, the fact that his wife's O-Face was in full 4K Ultra HD glory and her... um... ""sounds"" were resounding in crisp and clear stereo did not really seem to impress him much. In fact, he was pretty pissed. *sigh*  Oh well, ya can't please everybody all of the time.

700;1096.0;5.0;8.0;I have this monster installed on the ceiling of my bedroom just above our King sized bed. My wife insisted I hire a professional installer,but I had no money left so I did it myself. It did take 4 neighbors to hold it up while I nailed the support structure which I fabricated out of 2x4 wood planks to the ceiling. I wish I had a stud finder,but I couldn't afford that either. As to the viewing experience ,I must say that there  is nothing like looking up and seeing the remarkable picture of this beast 8 feet above my head,total immersion IMAX style. Only problem I've run into so far is that my wife always wants to be on the bottom during love making .;Great for the bedroom
701;1097.0;3.0;8.0;After watching Honey Boo Boo on my black and white 13 inch Wards TV I wanted to upgrade but didn't have the coin. But then the accident happened. My baby mom got her meth mixed up with her home made birth control and ended up in a coma. Since I pay the most in child support I was given power of attorney. So instead of pulling the plug I chose to sell off some of her organs...just some. I hear after 2015 organ prices are gonna go up so I need to protect my investment. I also need a 85 inch TV to see Honey Boo Boo in almost life size! So I was able to sell a kidney and some of her eggs to get the money for this TV. WOW it is big...It takes up and entire wall of the trailer. I am not a fan of the hand control...it makes it really hard to watch the Spice channel...and the OWN Network. Everyone in the trailer park are so jealous but I just say....get your own baby mom and swap out the meth with the home made birth control and they can have one too. Or they can just look out their window cause you can see it all through out the park.;Honey Boo Boo never looked so good.
712;1098.0;5.0;8.0;I bought this to watch my beloved Broncos play the Seachickens for the Super Bowl this weekend. To my surprise, as soon as I fired up this beast, it was already playing the game!

That's 85 inch x 2!\n\nAnyways, needless to say I enjoyed the game very much and I now know the score. I'll be going to the local bar and betting a few dollars on the winning team, my Broncos!\n\nIf you want to watch future TV shows before everyone else, this is the screen to get.

342;1106.0;4.0;6.0;I recently bought this TV, but sadly had to return it when I found out it weighed more than my 2015 Dodge Ram 2500...

In order to ""better"" myself, I spent a few years saving up for lap band surgery, face lift, liposuction, tummy tuck, lasik, laser ""back hair"" removal, hair transplant as well as chest, butt and penile implants (as well as a new Corvette).

I mean, Steve Harvey's face is HUGE! ...and my couch is close enough that I don't even need the remote as I can change the channel with my toes. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is on account of the nausea and vomiting that ensued shortly after watching Olympic Ping Pong, and the chronic whiplash I got from watching the Talladega race.\nOther than the monetary setback, the damage to my body, and the potential brain tumor I might be developing from the massive amount of microwaves in such a confined space, I would say that I would recommend this product to a friend.

Half the population of Kingston gathered, and we watched more than 10 Amazon drones come over the horizon, inch their way closer and closer, and finally drop this amazing TV in the city square.

The only problem was lack of funds, but this was easily amended when i sold my car and moved out of my apartment. I made a shelter out of the TV by leaning it over on two sticks and i plugged it into the bathroom at my local park with an extension cord. The TV puts off enough heat for me to cook my dinner (usually cat food) and I have a healthy tan. Of course I don't have cable, but I did buy a 1985 VCR with my left over funds.

The picture quality is like nothing I have ever seen, now you might think that's because I no longer own a head but I kept my eyes, I'm not stupid! The resolution is so high you can almost touch it, which I can't, did I mention I also sold my arms to buy Mars.

1219;1133.0;4.0;8.0;"I was on the fence about this but decided the Smart capabilities justified the price. Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, all available with a  click of the button! Next month I'm gonna add wi-fi to my house to take full advantage of these features. It does dominate my room and seems to be a ""focal point"" when guests arrive, but a few plants around it and an accent wall helped it blend in nicely. Out of the box, set up was easy but I did need a team of lumberjacks to cut through the cardboard. We don't have cable or satellite, so I was a bit disappointed with the built in antenna; it only pulled in a few stations and the quality was certainly not ""ultra 4k"". So here are my pros and cons of ownership:\nPros:\n1. You can see it from the space station. Literally. Someone called me and said it was disrupting ""data transmissions"" and asked that I adjust the sharpness, that seemed to solve the problem.\n2. People driving by from the freeway 3 miles away have taken to exiting the off ramp and parking in the lot across the street to view this. I started selling miscellaneous sundries such as popcorn, sparklers and bottled water and it helped to defray the cost, so that's nice.\n3. Uninterrupted viewing. While not a ""feature"" it was convenient that I can watch all my favorite VHS tapes from start to finish without interruption because everyone in my family left to stay with relatives until I can ""sort out this mess"". Whatever.\n\nCons:\n1. Sound quality is so-so. I attempted to hook up a soundbar but the television developed a mind of its own and seems to have eaten it. The factory speakers can certainly shatter glass but the bass was not as deep as I hoped.\n\n2. One HDMI input? That just seems like an oversight. I told the guy at Radio Shack and asked if there was a splitter or something but when I showed him the manual he laughed and called his friends over. Even he thought it was funny.\n\n3. While I enjoy the 3D experience, I feel for the money they should come with 2 sets of those blue and red cardboard glasses.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with this purchase.";I miss my family but this rocks

It looks great in my house and both my buddies Skinny Pete and Badger love it for porn! My only regret is that I had a falling out with my boss, Mr. White, and he almost killed me for buying the TV. Rest assured now that Walt has passed away (sad he died in a gunfight and not cancer), I will be buying two more of these!

And this is it! How will this 85"" TV save our economy, you ask? Well it's simple! I plan on imposing a new ""Super HD"" tax on everyone making over $250,000/year in this country. That money will go into a special fund, which will be used to be one of these marvelous televisions for EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN! That's right! You get a TV, and you get a TV, and even Rush Limbaugh gets a TV!\n\nOnce every American has one of these TV's in their home... which of course you all deserve, why, all of our woes will disappear! You can be instantly transported wherever you wish to go, all from the safety of your own home. Why get a job when you can watch marathons of the Kardashians or Duck Dynasty or even the Bad Girls Club??\n\nAnd for those Americans who don't have any housing? As a bonus, the box doubles as your very own studio apartment!\n\nI am confident that the American people will see the wisdom of my plan and will all come to love their new super HD TV's as much as they love their new insurance policies.\n\nThank you, and god bless America!\n\nP.S.

1313;1143.0;4.0;8.0;As a single mother of 6 kids, I admit it was difficult to save up enough money to purchase this TV.  For three whole months, I sold my food stamps and struggled to keep myself from spending my government assistance checks on cigarettes and fast food.  I really missed my steak dinners the last few months but it was worth the sacrifice to buy this TV.  The kids get free breakfast and lunch at school so they really only got hungry at dinner and on the weekends.\n\nAll 6 of the dads are deadbeats and it angered me to spend the child support payments on feeding my children instead of getting my hair and nails done.  I fought through the pain and finally saved enough money to order this TV.  Since my Hummer was in the shop getting 25 inch rims, I couldn't pick the TV up at the store and I decided to order it online.\n\nI live in a state where Amazon does not collect sales tax so ordering it online saved me a few thousand dollars as well.  I avoid paying sales tax at all cost and don't have a job to avoid income tax.  I tell my friends that my children are my paycheck and I am excited to announce that I am 6 months pregnant with number 7.  Hopefully I can figure out who the dad is before I give birth so I can put him on the birth certificate and hold him hostage for child support for the next 18 years.  Either way, having another child should put my monthly government assistance checks at around $20,000 so I figure I can scrape by.\n\nSo anyway..... back to the TV.  I regret to announce that the box arrived today but it was too big to fit in my trailer.  I'm not sure what I am going to do yet but I will make sure to post an update when I decide.;Finally saved up enough money to buy this TV.... WOW

1323;1145.0;1.0;8.0;This was airlifted to me via an Amazon Drone and when it was literally dropped off, it created a Grand Canyon sized crater where my front lawn used to be. To make matters worse my Grandma Noonie was sunning herself at the time and we have not seen her since.  All that is left are a pair of orthopedic Crocs, a pack of Marlboro lights and seven empty cans of Ensure.  I bought this TV because of the Neil Diamond song,  Samsung New, Everybody owns one!  But heres the thing: they accidentally sent me the wrong one. They sent me the U85S9 85-inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz NOT SO smart LED TV and all it plays is either Fox News or The Kardashians. At 85 inches and in 3D,  Kims bottom is the same shape and size of a Dumbos head and Elizabeth Hasselbeck looks like shes on a  billboard for Petas campaign to stop clubbing baby seals.  Watching blu ray movies unfortunately totally recreates the movie going experience: during every film, teenagers suddenly appear on our couch, texting, talking on the phone and screwing up the picture with their laser pointers. And when I went to the bathroom I noticed that a mentally challenged usher was in the doorway, trying desperately and unsuccessfully to count ticket stubs.  In the kitchen, several more mentally challenged movie workers were selling popcorn, taking, on average, three to four hours to deliver one coke and one small popcorn to a waiting customer.  When I called to complain, I got a recording of Kim Jung Un acting as Mr. Moviefone (acting out all the parts) and who then offered free vacations to North Korea which included hotel, airfare and one souvenier abandoned female newborn of your choice (that can be conveniently picked up at roadsides all over the country).;"""Samsung new, everybody owns one!"""
1339;1146.0;5.0;8.0;After hearing about the ability to control this tv with my voice, I decided to take the plunge and sell both of my arms on the black market in order to pay for it. I quickly ran into some problems with setup, as I could not lift the tv. Thankfully there is a god, and I had four diamond encrusted segways used for nightly polo matches that I could transport the tv with. After seeing the picture clarity, I tell ya, I would have thrown in one of my testicles to pay for this! From the moment I turned it on, and a rerun of Kris Humphries' and Kim Kardashian's wedding lit up the room, I knew that I had finally started living life.;Tricky setup!

1382;1150.0;1.0;8.0;"It is with utter disappointment that I write this review. When I first saw this masterpiece my gaze was locked on the sheer beauty of what was presented before me. The technological advancement we as a species have achieved by creating an 85 inch 4K ultra HD 120hz 3D Smart LED TV is only second to the ability to display an image of crystal clarity and perfect composition. Look at the magnificent symmetry and complementary nature of a snow covered landscape and cloud draped sky. The lonely tree standing solemnly off to the side clearly representing the human condition left stranded to endure the cold harsh reality of life. A tree desperately trying to achieve success by growing to the sky only to realize the cruel and devastating reality of being firmly tethered to the ground, a powerful metaphor for our trivial human journey. The isolation from all other life only adds to the struggle of this tree's poor existence and reminds us all that our efforts to provide shade to the ones we love is an exercise in heartbreak as the winter of old age will drive away any love or affection as our leaves of purpose wither and die.\n\nThe $39,997.99 price tag for this piece of art was an absolute bargain, especially when you consider the added benefit of a 4k ultra HD 3D smart LED TV that can be turned off when the emotional toll of staring at such a bitterly truthful scene of melancholy certainty is too much to bare. When I received this gift from GOD only five to eight business days after placing my order, I removed it carefully from its cardboard protective sheath and hung it on my wall, all the time handling it with the care of Mary cuddling the Baby Jesus. You can only imagine my disappointment when I plugged it into the electrical outlet bringing to life a bright blue screen where the words ""No Signal"" taunted me with the clarity only a 4K Ultra HD 120hz 3D Smart LED TV can provide. The image that so beautifully represented my dismal existence was not to be found.\n\nNothing could hurt me more than this disheartening moment, that was until I called the Samsung customer service department to ask for technical assistance in rendering the digital illustration of my newly acquired masterpiece. They laughed at me. They treated me as if I was an idiot for thinking a manufacturer was somehow responsible to provide a product that would in any way resemble the item pictured in the advertisement.";The disappointment is almost too much to bare

After pondering the potential purchase while receiving my daily foot massage from Isabela (plus drinking a few vintage 1775 Pino Noirs from my 37,000 SF wine cellar), it sounded like a good idea. Since my Apple stock went up 1 point, I received enough capital gaines to buy this television so decided to do so.

1460;1156.0;2.0;8.0;My uncle had recently damaged his older television in a drunken rage, so my family go together on Thanksgiving to pool our money to purchase him a new television. Thanks to our sound investments, we had an excess of money we were willing to donate, and were able to purchase a new television. In our drunken stupor, we had decided to spend all the money we had pooled, which turned out to be exactly the price of this television set.\n\nHis home is a maze of strangely shaped walls, broken doors, and piles of dirty clothing. The delivery driver had an assistant help move the television set, but they were unfortunately trapped in the stairwell, and the television had fallen and broke the assistant's back. Luckily the television was undamaged, as that was our main concern (we do pay for obamacare, so it shouldn't be an issue anyway for the assistant).\n\nUnfortunately a thunderfly did get in between the cracks. If you haven't had in insect in your monitor or television before count yourself lucky. Due to this blemish, he had kicked it several times, but it was undamaged, however repel rodent droppings did drop from the top, we are unsure if they were from the purchase or if rodents decided to use it as a lavatory. However, due to the recent poor weather, a pipe had burst and we found out that the television was not 'smart' enough to repel water. You'd think a television, which is frequently around liquids such as soda, bodily fluids, wet paint, and melted ice cream would be water repellent, but again samsung dropped the ball. They asked us to send it in to repair it, and I was giving out the information, but my S4 glitched and it dropped the call. Sometimes I feel if Samsung is spying on us and they did it on purpose so we wouldn't get a replacement. Smart phone indeed.;Not smart at all.

We've needed to lose a few pounds from the holidays, and giving up food seemed to be a surefire way to accomplish that.\n\nSure, we're feeling weak and tired all the time due to a lack of proper nutrition, but at least we can wallow in front of this gargantuan screen while we starve, starve, starve away the pounds!\n\nThe TV does take up some extra room. We had to punch out the ceiling in the family room so the top of the screen would fit. Thankfully, we did this before we started starving. Otherwise, we might not have the energy to do it now. Heck, I barely have enough energy to type this review.\n\nThe good thing about not having money for grocery shopping is you can see just how much excess food you had in the pantry.

534;1169.0;3.0;7.0;First of all, this thing arrived at my place and the delivery driver flat out refused to help me get it up the stairs. I live on the sixteenth floor, I'm not sure how he was expecting me to do it on my own. Eventually I roped some neighbours into helping, and discovered it couldn't fit up the staircase without some minor alterations being made. We grabbed some tools and set to it, and several hours later the TV had pride of place in my living room. The picture is good, but viewing is let down slightly by the join down the middle of the screen, and the remote no longer works either. Also at one point during set-up I apparently received a fairly hefty electric shock, and now I can't see the colour purple. Which is a shame, because that's a great film and I was looking forward to watching it on my new tv.;Not bad, bit of a hassle.
543;1170.0;1.0;7.0;After reading the incredible reviews of this product, I knew I had to have one. But, living in the box or even having my wife angry with me ain't the way I roll. When my neighbor got his, that's when I knew I was in luck. The only trouble is that I had no clue that he had motion detectors and cameras in his house. And then there were the guard dogs. It wasn't very neighborly of him to have all that protection for his stuff and not tell anyone.\n\nI'm only giving the TV one star. If I have to go through all that AND serve a few years, I don't call it much of a value. Think of all the Jerry Springer episodes I'm missing and you'd feel the same way.;Now what?
544;1171.0;4.0;7.0;I ordered this with my Amazon Prime account to save 5,000 off of the price. Imagine my dismay to discover it arrived with assembly required! I guess those excellent savings had to come from somewhere. The instructions seemed to be in some unidentifiable dialect, perhaps from an ancient destroyed galaxy.

A nice young man named Nikko let me in and after a little small talk he told me they recently had a shipment of top notch 85inch tvs from Samsong. Yeah, I know, I thought the same thing. It's Samsung. But he assured me that Samsong was the premier model line of Samsung. He called it the Lexxus of tv brands. The best part is the price. It only cost me $700 cash. He said since I paid in cash I wouldn't have to pay the sales tax.\nWell, I snapped up that deal quicker than you can say ""winning!"" Yeah, I know that's played out. Well, my only complaint is the delivery time. It's been almost a month and I'm still waiting for the tv to arrive.

I'm also regretting selling my first born, since it didn't come with a remote, I now have to walk across the room to switch channels or volume. I really need a subordinate to do that for me.

So I had them carry it up the stairs, (hey people piss in the staircase also go figure) well anyway I get this beauty in my house and take it out the box mount it on top of my old floor model black and white TV we had since i was 4 years old. When I noticed this damn thing was packed in styrofoam (o hell nah!) Im not throwing styrofoam in the garbage that stuff can't be recycled. So i kindly repacked the beautiful thing and sent it back.

I was looking at some other options, even considering hiring a team of engineer grad students at MIT to build me an 8k model, but that was gonna cost over $500,000.00. I decided to save some money and this TV had good reviews. I was able to get pre-approved for a HELOC at my local credit union at 3% only, this tv will be paid off in about 10 years only if I make bi-weekly payments. By then, I hope to be able to upgrade to an 8k, or maybe even 16k will be out by then, who knows! TV is great, I was able to freak out my friends by making it appear to be a window and have a meteorite impact on the horizon, they thought it was real, so great!\n\nOnly con, and why i gave it a 4 star, is it doesn't have an anologue input for my super nintendo, and the refresh rate is only 120hz.

Anyway flying to the good old US of A to pick one up was well worth it although I have deducted a star because it won't fit in the overhead lockers (actually it doesn't fit in the hold).

Since delivery I have been able to:  Find Waldo,  Find Carmen SanDiego, Find Jimmy Hoffas bones, Find Atlantis and quite possibly the most important finding...  I can see the acne scars, huge pores and cellulite  of every actor in every movie.  Let's just say this TV has not only changed my life be the residual incomes via my findings, but on a person level, it has increased my self confidence and I no longer struggle with the concern of fine lines, large pores and cosmetic surgery options,  that have cost me well over $40 k,  and I make sure my children's ""dreamy crushes"" appear on our beautiful TV so they can feel better about themselves, and the fact they are actually better looking in real life, to the point it doesn't matter if they are wearing clothes made out of sham wows and duct tape. To be fair there is a downside.  We are spending a lot more on Viagra, we didn't set the parental controls and my husband claims he accidentally stumbled across some "" adult "" type TV, and feels that he may be inferior comparatively in the man department according to what he saw in perfect clarity, nothing says you don't measure up like a 3.5 foot Willie ""by accident"".  We did have to remove the ceiling fans. But we have the controls hit on spin during commercials so it provides a nice healthy draft.  To be safe we do suggest purchasing large amounts of epoxy and duct tape,  just go ahead and secure things, like chairs and lamps  in case by accident an infomercial comes on.  Good lucky everyone..  I have to get back to the TV, I am pretty sure I just saw Elvis as an extra in a documentary about Amelia Earhart,  I need to let them know I found her plane, I can't believe no one else has found DB Cooper yet.

I had to sell my home and most of my furnishings to get it but the cardboard box it came in is large enough for me to live in so I'm not complaining.  It's just a shame my wife and children have not been able to move in with me so if anyone else who bought this TV would be willing to donate their boxes to me I would be forever grateful.  I would also be very appreciative if someone could send me some additional extension cords.  The cords I have just barely reach the Wal*Mart sign I am tapped into.\n\nThere are some codes you can use if you can figure out how to get into the Samsung special super-duper-secret stupendous setup section.

Once again I cannot tell you the codes, please remember, torture squad, ""My Mother the Car"" etc.\n\n1. Turn almost anything you watch into something you can reach into the screen to get.  Feel like grabbing a beer from your fridge?  Just find a beer commercial on the TV then reach in and grab a cold one.  Think of the money you'll save on food and drink.  Please note that this will not work if the item you are trying to get is bigger than your screen, so forget about that new car, new boat, new house, and so on.  Be careful with this though.  My dog jumped into the screen while I had a movie on that was shot in a forest.  He didn't come back until he had marked every tree.\n\n2. Turn anything you watch on it into holographic images.  You can combine the codes for 1 and 2 to make the holographic images real but this could be dangerous.  I did this while watching a boxing match and I wound up being knocked out by an uppercut which I accidentally stepped into when I stood up.\n\n3. Change the size of the picture you are watching.  This one is still buggy.  The only change you can do will make whatever you watch appear to be on a 10 inch black and white TV.  I imagine the next firmware update from Samsung will address this issue.\n\n4. You know this TV does standard 2D and 3D, right?  Well with the right code you can be watching TV in 1D.  Make this change and everything you watch will look like narrow stick figures.\n\nThere are more codes but I will keep them to myself until I update this review.";THE BEST TELEVISION EVER!

1175;1232.0;2.0;7.0;The purchase of this TV marked the end of my career.  Since 2009 I had been working as a movie reviewer for the adult film industry.  Marking the climax of this time was winning the Pull-itzer Prize in 2011 for my review of the now legendary film Money Balls.  After winning that award things in my career began to soften.  I was no longer able to keep it up with the new generation of reviewers who grew up with the internet and DVDs as opposed to just magazines and VHS tapes.  So in a desperate attempt to get back into the game, I ordered this TV.  I scheduled its arrival to coincide with the big release of World War G.  Unfortunately, the screen is just too big for me and I was never able to bring myself to finish the review.  After four amazing years in the industry, I was forced to pull out.  Over the next two months I lived off of donations to the local reproductive clinic.  Turns out they have a 350 donation limit, so they cut me off.  I was so depressed that I went home and ended up in a straight 72 hour lube fueled bender.  I woke up in the hospital 4 days later suffering from severe dehydration and major nerve damage in both hands.  Unable to pay rent, I was thrust out into the streets.  I sold the TV and have been living in the huge box it came in for the past month.  Fortunately, my doctor said that I should regain the use of my left hand in another couple of weeks.;Marked the end of my career.

My house is really cold due to the heat being shut off in the winter (I didn't pay my bill) and the screen will sometimes fog over due to the temperature difference. It also lacks a battery backup which is important because I don't always pay my electric bill. (Money has been really tight ever since I quit my job in January 2013.) I do however appreciate them being willing to let me pay for the tv in an installment plan as my unemployment checks came in, I probably wouldn't have been able to afford it if they made me pay for it all at once (I checked with the government office but it wouldn't give me all my unemployment money at once).;No battery back up otherwise really good

1202;1237.0;5.0;7.0;This TV is incredible! The picture is so life like, that I don't have to go outside anymore to the real world. Actually that is a good thing because of the surgery and the kidney I had to sell for this bad boy makes it hard to walk. My only concern is that my Mom wants one of these Flat screens and she keeps asking why do I need both lungs...;It is a give and a take thing!!!
1207;1238.0;5.0;7.0;Well worth it. I got $799.96 back in rewards and $1199.94 in amazon credit just for using my Amazon credit card. It's like I made 2 grand!;Made money!
1254;1239.0;5.0;7.0;"Don't mean to mislead anyone with the ""New Star"" title of the review. I wasn't referring to this TV being head and shoulders above all the other just-released ginormous megapixel offerings out there. I meant that I was viewing a deep space picture from the Hubble telescope on this TV and discovered a new star in the Dagobah system. I submitted it to the Star Names Astronomy Program for certification, and I'm hoping that they make it official before Christmas. So, thanks Samsung!";New Star
1269;1240.0;5.0;7.0;I bought this for the dormroom on sale for 40 grand.  I was looking for something a bit bigger, but i settled on this.  and what a steal,at only 10 dollars a vertical pixel.  How i bought it?  Easy, i sold my right nut.  You may think that's crazy, but its quite a conversation piece, you know something to tell my grandchildren when i buy them their spaceship with my left one, if i haven't already gotten rid of it by then.  The girls don't seem to mind, they sure love the bumpin bass.;Perfect dormroom piece
1281;1241.0;4.0;7.0;Wow. This tv has it all. 85 inches of pure glory. I was gonna send my kid to Vanderbilt, but decided to purchase this instead. She will understand one day.;Awesome deal
1285;1242.0;4.0;7.0;Since installing the Samsung 85 incher our neighbors are convinced we are aliens because of the bright glow emanating from our living room window.  We would have given it 5 stars but every time we watch TV, especially if we are watching The Walking Dead, we have to close the living room curtains as the folks across the street have set up chairs on their front lawn and are selling popcorn.  Rumor has it they are canceling cable and that just ain't right.  But we love our new TV anyway.;It Was Worth Not Paying The Trailer Lot Rent These Last 6 Months

1289;1244.0;5.0;7.0;"I blew it all on this TV.  The minimum payment at 22% scattered across 8 credit cards I used to buy this bad boy is only $1,000 a month.  I don't know why everyone does not go and do this.  Of course that was my rent money and I had to move into my friend's unfinished basement, but he loves the TV almost as much as I do.\n\nI am sure my life will go much better now that my field of vision is saturated in 4K Ultra HD goodness.  Snookie and the rest of the Jersey Shore crew never looked so good.  And when she says ""Yes To The Dress"" I can't believe the clarity.

Everyone in the city has paid 10.00 each to come watch the news tonight, then a rerun of 2 1/2 men, and the full hour episode of Survivor. With 5,000 people in our town, 4.00 for the hot dogs, 2.00 for the popcorn, and 50 cents to drink out of the hose, we will have this paid for in 1 day. Thanks Samsung for making this possible;Our Own Front Yard Drive-In
1327;1247.0;1.0;7.0;This wasn't nearly big enough for the price.  That's why I immediately gave it to Jason and bought a 200-Inch for $55,000.  I saved over $14,000!  For $39,000 and 85 inches, it won't even make Tony see open receivers.;Too Small

Unfortunately for me and my henchmen supercop John McClane's wife worked there and he just happened to be surprising her at the company christmas party.  Even though he was barefoot he still managed to kill everyone of my men and throw me off the building.

1381;1251.0;5.0;7.0;I just bought this TV and I don't know where to put it. I'm thinking about the 3rd grand ball room, or maybe in my 17th kitchen.

1400;1253.0;1.0;7.0;"I have a 42"" Sanyo TV I bought a few years ago at a WalMart Black Friday sale at 330 am that I had a hard time giving up for this 85"" Samsung. It took a lot of convincing to trade my old reliable TV for something this big, new and expensive.  After finally learning how to program my VCR with the correct date and time and hooking it up to my current TV I found it disconcerting to find that it doesn't work the same with this TV as it does with my Sanyo.  If you had one with a built in VCR or at least the RCA jacks I might keep it but since I have no desire to try to rebuild my current VCR library with DVD's or Blu-Ray's I was forced to return it and keep my old 42"" Sanyo.  Now I need an 8-track adapter for my AMC Pacer so I can play my Mitch Miller 8-tracks.";Doesn't play VCR tapes well...
1410;1254.0;5.0;7.0;It was magical day when this arrived on my front porch. Instead of having drones fly it to my house it arrived by Jeff Bezos private helicopter. I was impressed with this type service. When i unboxed this TV it was like unboxing the heavens. But to my surprise instead of angels flying around me out came a little korean model named Ling Ling. To my astonishment she had been packed in the box, luckily there were a few holes in the box that she could get fresh air through. I was a little annoyed at first when I set up the tv in my living room. Ling Ling kept standing to the side of it making model gestures to show the size of the TV. Then I was going to have to explain to my wife why I had a korean women in our house. So my wife finally arrived after a long day of shopping and I told\nher what I bought and what else showed up with it. She was not happy about my purchase. She was not impressed by the size of it. (typical woman) and then told me that I couldv'e got the Sharp LC-90LE657 90-inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED 3D HDTV for thousands of dollars less. As she continued drilling me she mentioned that the extra 5 inches would be much nicer than what I had. (I think she told the mailman the same thing) But what mattered is that I was happy and now we have a roomate to help with the chores around the house too. So now im in the dog house and will be turning the TV sideways so its flat and use it for a bed. All in all a great purchase.;Its like 3 things for the price 1.
1415;1255.0;5.0;7.0;"I'm going to be honest here. It was either this TV or a down payment for a house. Considering they are tightening up the mortgage restrictions, I was left with only one choice. As you may have guessed, that choice wasn't a 30-year marriage to a shed (but hey, after a few hundred grand in interest, that shed would've been mine).\n\nWas my decision a bad one? All I can say is this: Not only does this TV provide me with one of the most stunning pictures I've ever laid my eyes on, but it's got a couple hidden features (or gems, if you want to call them that). For example, if it ever rains, I can just tip this bad boy towards the ground for adequate coverage. The best part: I can lay under this and still watch TV as the rain slides right off of it! Protection AND entertainment wrapped into one sleek package. Hard to go wrong with that.\n\nOf course, the UN85S9 has its downsides. My buddy got his power bill the other day and wasn't too happy about it. You should have seen his face when he found out I had been living on the side of his garage, siphoning his electricity with a cheap extension cord from Home Depot (should've went with the 10 gauge, but after drinking two pints of Guinness at my sister's dance recital, things got a little cloudy). When he saw that I had been using the UN85S9, however, he quickly apologized and joined me for the finale of ""Dancing With the Stars."" Afterwards, he gently reached over to tickle my elbow to get my attention (I know, he can be ""different"" at times), and that was when he hit me with the greatest thing I heard since I got this TV: I was moving into his garage!\n\nOk - enough of my blabbering mouth. I know what it is that you're wondering. Was the UN85S9 worth it? Well, I finally have a garage that I can call home, and I've also got one of the baddest television sets known to man. Down payment, shmown payment! Forgo the house and get this TV. You...won't...regret...it!";It was a house or the TV. Can you guess what I chose?
1417;1256.0;4.0;7.0;I don't know why everybody is complaining about the price, simply sell a kidney to pay for it, like I did.  Right now I'm enjoying the amazing picture clarity from the comfort of my Duxiana (which I purchased by selling a lung, but that's a story for another time) as I recover from surgery.  I've never realized just how handsome that Drew Carey really is!  Regular HD does him no justice.  Anyway, I have to cut my review short as Peapod will be here soon with my groceries.  I recently purchased a Vitamix 7500 to help me lose weight (by selling bone marrow, but, hello, ouch!).  But then I realized--if I keep parting myself out in order to buy ridiculously overpriced, materialistic items, I will reach my weight loss goal in no time!;Helps with weight loss

There is a natural spring only about 20 miles from my house. I figure I can ride out there on my BMX and bring back a bucket once a week to last me.

1457;1261.0;3.0;7.0;"My wife and I bought one for the kids because the previous smart tv in the guest game room didn't have the clarity and size their friends wanted. They often use the room to play on the Sega Genesis, as old school games are the current fad. Since Sega doesn't have the highest resolution, we thought a cheaper tv like this would suffice. The problem is the screen strength. My son convinced his friend that the tv doubled as a portal to Dimension X.

What I thought was a worthless piece of crap turned out to be worth $40-50K so I put it on Sotheby's and it fetched over $100K but with the fees and middlemen I had to pay, I was left with $44K, just enough to pay for this TV with tax.  The first shipment was damaged but since the delivery person had already left, Amazon agreed to send in their heavy duty drones to pick it up.  They had the foresight to deliver a brand new one using the drone so the damaged one was loaded and returned on the same day.  You should have seen the commotion in my cul-de-sac when the drone arrived.  It looked like a full sized helicopter but without a live person.  In its place, there was a bot in the driver's seat with a TV monitor head of the person navigating the drone, sort of like Sheldon in Big Bang Theory when he decided to stay home and send his bot off with Lenoard. The TV quality was OK but honestly, didn't seem that much better than watching my $99 13"" 720p Coby TV sitting closeup at  around 1 foot away.

So when it got to the house I threw out my back trying to get it out of the box but I went to work later that day and said I did it at work so workmans comp is now paying for that, and im using that money to pay little Tony Back, problem is I missed a couple payments, and started to notice someone was following  me.

Thank you Samsung for making such a great TV.;TV OF MY DREAMS
581;1279.0;5.0;6.0;"I first saw this massive piece of super advanced extraterrestrial technology from a distance while my wife was browsing the television section on her new ipad44 on the Web. I knew I had to have this baby, 85"" of lifelike clarity, the kind of stuff you only see through the hubble telescope. My connections with the black market organ division apparently did not have any demand for vital organs mostly because they have seen a recent surge in willing donors, no doubt corresponding with the release of this TV. I was at a roadblock, I didn't know how I was going to get the 40k for this TV, I had to do something fast before the promotional sale ended. I knew I had one week. What took place over the next week is something only OJ Simpson could get away with. I was sitting at my table in the early hours of January 20'th 2014 drinking a freshly brewed cup of Kopi when it hit me, I knew exactly what needed to happen for my dream to come true. Visions of avatar in super 4K HD video were flashing before my eyes, the vibrant intensity of all the blue (which is my favorite color btw) had my heart near cardiac arrest. I recalled being at thanksgiving dinner this past year and my father, a few Heineken deep told me and my wife that he had taken out a life insurance policy just in case any freak accidents ever happened. Now, don't get me wrong, my father and I have a great relationship but I thought to myself, surely an 85"" television of this quality would be enough to help grieve through the loss of a father. I won't get into the grim details of what happened last week but let's just say that OJ Simpson couldn't of pulled off this job as clean as I did. Fast forward to today. I got the money, turns out it was for 50k, some life insurance policy that was. My wife has left me and took the kids, dogs and cat. I got to keep the NES with Super Mario Bros 3 though. I was put out on the street with nothing but 50k in cold hard cash. I converted 40k into prepaid mastercards which is a another story in its self, try explaining why you need 400 prepaid 100 dollar mastercards to the girl working the counter at the pharmacy. Anyway, approximately 74 hours later I had my mastercards ready to go. My only problem at this point was how to get this rocket ship sized TV delivered to the abandon warehouse I was now living in. I decided to open a P.O box. Free shipping was key in this decision as 190 pounds of sey circuitry and glass would cost a fortune to ship. I got it 2 days later(wow that was fast). The remaining cash was used to purchase a 10k gas generator which I wasn't sure if that would even be enough jigawatts to run this monstrosity, luckily I had doc brown on speed dial if needed. I am glad to say that it is up and running now and this old warehouse aside from the rodents has never been so vibrant. I'm a pretty big deal around these parts.

I spent the next 3 days cowering behind the sofa as i couldn't find the remote (luckily enough it was also behind the sofa).\n\nI am now playing Kevin Keegan's Player Manager and so far, no more monsters.\n\nEDIT - There is a slight health problem with this TV. if you watch it for more than 65 seconds in any 24 hour period, you may bleed out of your eyes, ears and nose. - However if you're like me, then you'll have about 9 pints of blood in your body, so you can realistically get away with 5 minutes of watching, just remember to retain the blood. Wearing a cone they use for dog's who have just had surgery works fine - just wear swimming goggles.;WOW!!!
601;1281.0;4.0;6.0;I picked this up in the black friday sale so I only paid $250 for it.  For that money it's an OK television although my wife says its a bit on the big side for our small bedroom.\n\nI don't know that I'd pay the full price for it.  And the other negative of it is that when I upgrade this is going to be tricky to get to the dump.;A bargain.
612;1282.0;5.0;6.0;Wow after reading everyone's reviews I just had to have this TV....at any cost.  I decided to make a deal with the devil himself and give him my first newborn except I went into menopause about 10 years ago.  Well, that's the price one has to pay for being motherless.  I'll just have to muddle thru this miserable life with my 40 inch TV.  Sometimes life is just so unfair.;Samsung or bust

749;1294.0;3.0;6.0;"we contemplated ordering this, but I was afraid the screen size would make my package look that much smaller, however my wife stated it wouldn't. Soon after knocking off the local casino via gunpoint, I was able to buy this TV. LIES LIES LIES!!!!! my wife now insists how small my little roman soldier looks, considering the whale sized dongs now showing in Game of Thrones in ultra HD 3D solar flare. I suspect she had ulterior motives all along. now my dong hates me, wife watches Game of Thrones on repeat, my retinas burned out, people keep parking on my lawn in convertibles looking in through the hole I had to cut in the side of the house to get it in, the mob is looking for me, and I am being sued by IMax. all in all, I can not recommend this product, it didn't even come with batteries for the 40"" sized remote.";Lies, in HD!

780;1297.0;3.0;6.0;So there I was thinking I'd have a spiffing good weekend and went and bought this television set. It's completely useless! There's no co-axial port in the back so I can't even play my Sega Master System in it, the original intention of purchase.\n\nSo I thought, that's no biggy I can survive it! Now I find out that it's not compatible with Beta Max. Like What The Eff Samsung? I've got a tv that won't even function as a $40,000 mirror because it has a non-reflective screen.\n\nYou have broken me oh 85 inch television. I'm a gaddam Vietnam Veteran, I've completed 16 tours and have seen countless bad things and did not bat an eyelid and now this tv has me on the ground crying like anew born baby otter.\n\nEDIT: This actually works great as a table, however I do recommend coasters as carrot juice is prone to spill!;Beware Before You Buy!
782;1298.0;3.0;6.0;"The sales guy described this as ""it's like a photograph"" and ""work of art."" I liked what I saw and thought it was a great investment so I bought it. When I got it home, I went to hang it up in the art gallery when I noticed the painting was gone and it came with cables. I thought it was strange but some of the modern art is not as intuitive as the traditional stuff. Right after that, I realized it's a TV! Wow. That really took me back. I'm not sure what to do with it now. I'm waiting for the Louve to call me back on whether or not I could stream the Mona Lisa live.";Wasn't made clear what I was purchasing...

838;1301.0;5.0;6.0;After reading all these helpful reviews, I thought. Gees, another home equity loan is no big deal since I'm 90 and the bank will be stuck with the TV and my bills soon. Sooo worth the price. If you hurry the discount promo code should still be active that I found online;Would buy again
847;1302.0;4.0;6.0;I bought three of these for about 120,000 dollars. It turned out that there was a firefly inside the screen, so it would always be on. Plus I stole some money! I got this for my one year old daughter so that she can tell her friends how rich she is. I am also cousins with Bill Gates. The UPS man yelled at me, and he almost cracked the screen. This TV is pretty good though.;Good... but
848;1303.0;5.0;6.0;I bought it from amazon for the free shipping.  Can't beat that!  The local building office was concerned when I wanted to bring 220 into the living room to support it, but they understood when I explained and even helped with the structural modification necessary for my double wide so the whole thing wouldn't tip over, again.;Free shipping!
849;1304.0;5.0;6.0;First of all the price blew my mind, it was soooo cheap. I bought each of my sons this for Christmas, and all four of them are very satisfied. Personally my marriage was going down the drain, but after this purchase, its bonding powers allowed us to rekindle our passion for each other. Once again the price was amazing. Not only is it cheap, but it's 4k technology makes my world HD. This might have affected how my wife and I rekindled our passion. At any rate BUY THIS TV, it's CHEAP and life changing. Your spouse will thank you.;Best Tv for a Steal

862;1307.0;5.0;6.0;Was about to add the 84 inch Sony to my cart, but then I saw this beast. Totally worth the extra $15K.;That extra inch makes all the difference
864;1308.0;5.0;6.0;"I wasn't very impressed with the audio of this unit, so, I decided to ramp things up a bit. To start, good speaker wire is a must. At the amazing price of $48,000.00, two strands of these (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wireworld-Platinum-Eclipse-Biwired-Speaker/dp/B00CHSRKJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wireworld Platinum Eclipse Biwired Speaker</a>&nbsp;) 6 meters each was short of my needs so I ordered three sets. The drivers I decided on were these beauties (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waterfall-Audio-Niagara-Standing-Loudspeakers/dp/B002BSH27I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waterfall Audio Niagara Standing Loudspeakers</a>&nbsp;)  that $39,393.71 a pair which, of coarse, I ordered two. To crunch enough power into these bad boys, I used this beast! (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Klipsch-THX-Ultra2-TX-NR3010-Elite-20/dp/B00DZ04SF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Klipsch THX Ultra2 TX NR3010 Elite 20</a>&nbsp;) At only $12974.00, I couldn't pass it up.\nThe next challenge that I faced was another wiring issue. Since most of the units at our trailer park are wired with only 100 amp service panels, I worked with Earl, Junior and Darlene to jump all of our systems together in a quasi parallel/series set-up that keeps the extension cords to a minimal running through the puddles on the 'round-a-bout'.\nAnother challenge overcome was getting this monster in the park. The semi and forklift that delivered it couldn't get further than the dumpsters, so, moved Ray's trailer while he was at work and backed in in from that snazzy neighborhood next door that has them home-owners bi-laws. We got the privacy fence back up before the cops got there and the only proof of our so-called 'trespassing' was the giant muddy ruts left through them folks yard. Since all of us are... well... retired, and home that day as 'witnesses', the police are still looking for that maniac in the dump truck that made the turn around in those peoples yard. The only damage done, well, besides the ruts, was the three sago palms that got 'bumped'.... oh.. and that fancy sprinkler system got a couple of lines broke... oh, and now their sewer backs up because the drain fields got crushed a little.\nNow, I bet you're wondering why I ordered an extra pair of them speaker cables when I only ordered four speakers...huh? Well, I had to use them other two cable to keep my girlfriend Cherry from gettin' loose. She was a little concerned after her old man showed up wondering about the address that showed up on his credit card when this stuff was delivered. Well, to say the least, nobody's gotta worry about him snoopin' around anymore! Hehee!! Remember that movie Deliverance? Oh yeah! Squeal like a pig boy! Squeal like a pig!!\nAnyhow, after all the trouble gettin' that thing in the yard, we found out that it would fit in the door. Simple solution! We sawsalled the aluminum off the end of the old domicile and just mounted that thing to the end of the trailer! No worry about being exposed to rain and such. We just split the box open that it was delivered in and used it to extended the roof out over this beautiful creature. Earl had the best idea... He said we oughta mount it on swivels. That way, we can just spin it around and show movies outside and charge admission. The only problem we had was figuring a easy way to move all the sound equipment outside, but, that kinda took care of itself. The first time we powered them babies up, all the windows blew in the mobile home, so, problem solved! That also took care of a few of the pesky pit bulls that had been running loose in the neighborhood. The biggest problem I had was calming Cherry down over the stains when all of her cats went boo boo at the same time and then my Rottweiler, Crusty, got a little confused with all the racket. She's still a little miffed about them cats, but, at least it got her mind off of her old life with that pasty feller that she had been living off of. His new boyfriend didn't want her hanging around anymore....\nSo, all in all... once the mods were in place, the neighbors and I are all pretty impressed with this little set-up. There's been a little wrangling with the uppity crowd from the neighborhood next door, but, once we drive the property values down enough, we got a man that's good with something called CRA's... community reinvestment act loans or something like that. We should be able to get enough to purge the area of them undesirables and them we can get the state to come in and bull doze them houses and make room for a whole slew of 'modular homes'. We'll be raking in the cash with all the proceeds from the 'theater'!\nThree thumbs up on this one!!!";Poor Audio...
885;1309.0;5.0;6.0;I was going to go to college, but I decided to get this TV instead.\n\nWhen I got this TV, I expected that 4 K's were going to be on it, but there were not 4 K's on the screen. The quality was good and this TV had amazing quality. Looks like I am not going to get an education anymore!;Spend your money!
895;1310.0;3.0;6.0;i got my parents one of these bad boys for christmas and a copy of the hunger games 2....this TV has so many more features than one would expect... it sends crazy signals to your mind and you start acting funny.. next thing you know ... it sucks you into it. too bad I didn't survive the hunger games. I am writing this review from distress.;...
899;1311.0;1.0;6.0;Me and my partner have recently just hit and run a close family member in order to get our hands on one of these beauties, we are delighted with the quality and clarity, my boyfriend said it was worth it as he can now play his Xbox One in great detail;Best TV on planet
905;1312.0;3.0;6.0;This TV was a great purchase. I bought it because it would easily fit the 35x69 high-res photos that I used to keep taped to my ceiling without having to worry about any silly letterbox formatting or resizing the photos, but I find myself highly disappointed. With a TV of this caliber and price you would think someone at Samsung would have thought about adding hanging mounts that can be used to transistion to a ceiling installation. I know I'm not the first person to think about this and I'm honestly disgusted more people haven't spoken up with their disappointment. C'mon Samsung!\n\n  If I'm going to spend this kind of money on a TV to mount above my bed, at least throw in the 4 dollar brackets, jerks.\n\n  -Mustang Fan;No ceiling mounts?
375;1313.0;5.0;5.0;I can tell you that this T V was worth it at twice the price so I bought two at SAMs Club for the price of three. It's okay though. I donated one to the starving kids in Nigeria or is it Mississippi? I really don't recall, but it was a great tax write off. Then I ran outta room for the second one and as luck would have, I had a big party and as luck would have it, it made a great table and conversation piece. Cheers;Why buy one when you buy three?
933;1314.0;4.0;6.0;I originally was going to use this 40k to go on quite a few trips around the world to see places I've always wanted to see, but then realized I could do it sitting on my couch, inside my house #yolo;Who needs to travel?
937;1315.0;5.0;6.0;"I bought this TV after selling a kidney, a lung and 1 testicle on the black-market over the summer break. Luckily, these TV's were still in stock while I was collecting from the organ recipients. After splurging on the TV and a ""nudicle"" (Replacement plastic testicle) I decided to take some time off and enjoy the comfort this TV provided during my recovery. All I can say is the picture is so unbelievably clear and realistic it has changed my life, in some ways for the worse as I am now using the bathroom every 11 minutes and can not take 15 steps without having a shortness in breath, but the HD picture makes it all worth it. The only downside I have now is that I can no longer watch exciting or horrifying movies as my lack of lung capacity could kill me during intense/scary scenes. Overall great purchase.";Well, Well, Worth It.
945;1316.0;5.0;6.0;Turning out my husband for a weeks worth of tricks and picking up gardening in my former guest room with my own hydrophonic system I finally saved enough to purchase this. It was well worth all the hard work. I definitely recommend this product!!!;FINALLY MINE!!
972;1317.0;5.0;6.0;I saw this TV and instantly disenrolled from college next semester. After purchasing the TV, with student loans, I realized I made the right decision when I turned on Monday Night football.

What kind of piece of  cr*p (its a mean word for ""poop"") is this!?!?!?!?\n\nSo i saved a few bucks (well, not really, since it aint even my credit card!) and bought the super deluxe above ground swimmin' pool I always wanted!

1000;1319.0;4.0;6.0;We traded in 2 cars to get this bad boy. And let me tell you, it was soooo worth it. We have decided to walk to work from then on, or occasionally if we can afford it we use the public transportation. Now th 4 star rating is not because of the TV, but because of the fact that at times we have to sleep at work in order to come to work on time the next day. But hey no problem!\nIt is so worth watching LOTR on this TV in 17 minute segments daily......I mean with all the walking to work that is all that we can manage, but hey, it feels like we are out there with Frodo, for the Nth time destroying that darn ring in the fires of Mordor.\nI guess the -1 star from a perfect score is also attributed to an occasional fight with the wife......I mean 17 mins/day, yeah we can get testy at each other over what we would like to watch in that time span. But again, not too big of a problem.\nUltimately, we can't wait until the 100+ inch version of this TV comes so we can trade this bad boy in, move to a studio from our current 2 bedroom apartment, and get a loan from the bank to get the next greatest TV on the market. Hope we won't have to wait too long for that. And I wonder if the interest rate on the TV will be low?\n\nIn the end, it was a great buy. We recommend it to all the enemies first, and then friends and family. for now, I guess they can just watch stuff on their boring TV and sleep while we enjoy 17 mins of 4K Ultra daily entertainment. Sweetness :);Awesome TV, but a few minor flaws.......
1017;1320.0;5.0;6.0;I dropped out of college and used whatever loan money I had left to buy the this. So worth, despite my wife leaving me, and my entire life being thrown into disarray, I loved this purchase. Who needs a house? This doubles as a bed, kitchen, and a nursery for my little girl.;Worth more than life itself!
1039;1321.0;4.0;6.0;So i was in my bathroom shortly after purchasing this work of art and slipped, hitting my head on the toilet. I had the vision of the flux capacitor to hook up to this bad boy. I was able to use the software built into netflix to select the year a movie was made and travel back to that time. Turns out I selected 1985 for Back to the Future and ended up hooking up with my own mother and I'm stuck in 1985 in some sort of paradox. Thankfully the wormhole must be open still because i'm getting a wifi signal and able to browse the internet thus leaving this review... So if anyone could buy another one of the last 3 TVs and perhaps use the same technology from the terminator to travel back in time  (yes I realize you might end up in 1985 naked but hey... it could be worse) and stop me from banging my mom that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nOh and the 4 star rating is because I don't see an S video hookup for my VHS.;Help!

1154;1331.0;3.0;6.0;Dear Santa,\n\nI don't need this TV -- my vision has about as many pixels as this TV, but I do have a friend who REALLY REALLY wants this TV.  Normally, I know you only give gifts to good children, and, most children get a reasonable gift, say a box of building blocks.  That's about $40.  This is about 1000 times that, but I figure he qualifies.  He's been good for nearly that long.  I'm not saying he's old, but let's just say he's probably earned enough good-credit.  Given his advanced age, please have a team deliver this, preferably a large collection of elves...\n\nI am concerned there are only three left -- do you think he can still get one.;Perfect gift for those over the hill

1179;1335.0;4.0;6.0;Loved the TV, but once the Affordable Care Act kicked in, I lost my health insurance and my sponging 26 year old kid needed his heart fixed.  It was either the spoiled 26 year old man who can't take care of himself or the TV.  So I returned the TV,  paid the small $8000 restocking fee and was eventually able to get an approved Bronze care plan with a $32,000 deductible from the government healthcare website.  Can't believe the site actually worked.  Just my luck.  So, in the end, it was basically a wash.  Thanks Obama.\n\nUpdate:\n\nBTW, my young man is fine now.  (Thank you to those who care)  But, he is really upset his friend Amanda never visited him in the hospital and isn't returning his texts or phone calls.;Not better than healthcare.
1191;1336.0;5.0;6.0;The price point is about right.  We bought two of them, one for us and one for the kids.  The salesperson promptly informed me that I would need to match them with a high end Dolby 7.1 surround systems--the kind with vacuum tubes on the outside of the case and speakers that will clear snow and leaves from your driveway.  OK that, another $80K.  Then the salesperson brought in somebody from Delivery who asked about the pitch of my driveway and doorway clearances.  They decided I needed to do some deforestation and repaving before they could deliver.  They knew a guy who could take care of that.  All good.  These TV's have changed our family's lives.

1204;1338.0;5.0;6.0;I was originally going to give it 4 stars, but they included the 2 AA batteries for the remote, which was a the deciding factor for me in purchasing this TV.  This TV was a steal to.  I mean, I saved over $5,000 dollars, which I am now going to use towards a new TV to put in my attic.  I was a little skeptical about this new 4K Ultra HD thing, but I gotta tell you.  The image quality is better than real life.  I didn't even know that was possible, but Samsung has proven me wrong.  Because of this, I ended up buying another TV, and I saved myself the hassle of buying 2 AA batteries because each TV comes with them already!  I did do a Amazon search to see what AA batteries are running for these days, but all of the sellers had the nerve to charge for shipping.  Because of this, I just bought another TV because, like I said, it comes with 2 FREE AA batteries.  And did I mention free shipping?!  I mean, come on!  Who doesn't love free shipping?;Batteries Included + Free Shipping
1234;1339.0;1.0;6.0;I wanted to love this television, I really did.  All the money I had in my pension would be worth it, I thought, considering that any day now, some government entity would probably declare bankruptcy and my 401k would somehow be forfeit.  Best to spend it now, I thought, and what better to buy than the best television on the market!  I was really looking forward to the voice recognition and using gestures with the television, and when I hooked it up and got 'er goin', I felt like I was Kathryn Janeway on StarTrek Voyager. Make it so!\n\nAt least until I watched my first Detroit Lions game on this television.  The stupid calls, the bonehead plays, the idiots...THE IDIOTS got my blood pressure up, and I started yelling at the referees, the players on both sides, and the coach, because ya know, I felt like I was RIGHT THERE.  At some point I noticed a tiny flicker in the screen but by then, I was too far into my tirade to stop, leading up to the point where I used the gesture technology to express my feelings to the ref.  The screen just blew right up at that point, and my house burned down.\n\nThe good news is we all got out of the house fine, and we're living at the Red Roof Inn until the insurance money comes through. Luckily, I had put a rider on our homeowners insurance to cover this thing.  However, I won't be buying another one.  I don't think that this technology is anywhere near ready for rabid football fans.;Gesture technology - Boon or Bane?

1257;1342.0;5.0;6.0;"I didn't think it was possible to find true joy again, but I did it. When I was fifteen my parents died and I was orphaned. Since then I've worked at Wal-Mart, forced to roam the electronics section staring at vizio tvs. Working 70 hours a week but still Part time, I was miserable and lonely. I was tired of selling recycled plastic vizio tvs to overweight women who looked twice their real age. Even worse were the swarms of Indians who came in on black Friday asking me for additional discounts on the umrp brand tvs. I shed more years while hiding from Indian men with mustaches, fake ""north face"" coats, and flip flops in November, than when my parents died years ago. Then, to my astonishment, a customer asked if we carried the 85 inch Samsung 4k tv. I was puzzled by the request and immediately searched vizios website but found only more e series flagships. The customer left disappointed, and iwent home that day with hunger in my heart. I found the tv on amazon and bought it with my Wal-Mart master card, a few hundred dollars on my PayPal from selling stolen tvs from Wal-Mart, and the remaining $36,788 I had received as inheritance. I would need a new keyboard to tell you how good my 2160p tv makes my 720p hd cable look. I am so glad my parents died,or I would not have been able to get this tv. One time I tried to count all 8 million pixels on the screen, but I ended up bleeding from my pupils and got blood on my hdmi cords. Just as my picture as flickering, I headed to best buy to pick up an audio quest vodka cable. I knew if I had the Samsung 85 inch that I would need a cable that could handle the detailed sound quality of Verizon fios. Well anyway, I've been away from Sammy (my tv) for too long.

1315;1350.0;5.0;6.0;I have been saving my whole career for something like this. As soon as I saw this I knew I had to have it. I couldn't think of anything else in this life worth saving for so I took my savings, cashed in my 401K, pawned my new PS4 and stole my dads credit card for the remaining $39,467.34. It took 2 days to get it (expedited shipping!!!  Thanks dad) and I knew what I had to do. I threw 6 months of hard training at Taco Bell down the drain and quit high school with only 2  years to go so I could focus all my energy on this badboy .

(hope they don't shut my phone off)\n*******\nUpdate: Mom if your reading this, sorry about all the mess behind the poolhouse. I had to move again because the rain collapsed my crib. TV survived luckily. Best thing ever happened though. I met this guy walking down the street who said he would let me rent a room in his basement for free. Thank god the pawn shop didn't take the PS2, because I can watch TV and play games all day with Bill.

1412;1364.0;4.0;6.0;"When I first bought this TV, my wife was very upset. Mainly because 85"" is a lot more than she is used to handling. I assured her that, once she took in the whole experience, she would never be the same. I was right.\n\nNow, I'll admit, once it showed up at our front door, it seemed virtually impossible to fit the whole thing in. As a matter of fact, the first time, my wife whined that it was WAY too big, and there was no possible to fit the whole thing in there. Fortunately, with a little elbow grease and some lubrication along the walls, we stuffed it right in. I can assure you, there is no possible way for us to get anything in that area at all, now that it's in there, but it fit, thankfully. (I'm not sure if we'll ever be able to get it out, either.)\n\nThe first time I hit the power button, my wife complained that it gave off too much heat, and the vibration from the speaker made it a little awkward to her liking. She soon got used to that, though. I thought there was something wrong with it, because my wife seemed to look uncomfortable every time I turned it on, but she's doing fine now.\n\nI must say, if there's anything to complain about, it's simply this: the sound is a bit muffled, and it fades in and out, depending on where she stands in the room. For instance, if she is in the kitchen, it sounds muffled and faded, but when she's close to me, it's just muffled. I also noticed that it smells kinda strange after it being in there for a few weeks. Otherwise, it's a great addition to our lives. She's not nearly as bitter about the MUCH smaller one she had been used to for the last 10 years.\n\nMy suggestion is this: When you tell your wife that you are going to give her 85"" for Christmas, she's going to complain, but just stick to the plan. She will eventually get used to it.";Can't believe it fit, but we made it work...
1428;1365.0;5.0;6.0;"At one time I had a normal 65"" flatscreen LED that seemed adequate for movies and Xbox. Then I stumbled upon this TV, and I suddenly sensed there was something missing in my life. My wife, Didi, tried to tell me it was because I had left my seven-year-old son at a Best Buy in downtown Detroit, but she doesn't understand that you have to camp out overnight when the Xbox One launches. Any way, he got me one, so it's clearly not that. Good job, Timmy, wherever you went after snagging that coveted console! Any how, I'm playing Battlefield 4, and I'm getting my ass kicked by a bunch of Indonesian third graders, and I realize that it's probably because of the inadequate screen size of my TV, and the fuzziness of 1080p resolution. Luckily my wife has a really high limit on the the credit card that I signed her up for. Yearly income? One million dollars! Even more fortuitous, I've been unemployed for the last three years, so I'm home to intercept the bill while she's at her second job.\n  Now armed with this plastic wish fulfiller, I discovered that Amazon is discounting this beast five grand, which is probably why there were only three left in stock. Without hesitation, I clicked on ""add to cart"", but then began worrying about how I would pay the bill. And then I had an epiphany - the credit card was in my wife's name. With that moral dilemma lifted, I laid back on my couch, took another bong hit, and hallucinated in 4K. About a week later I'm walking my dog, Max, and as he's defecating on my neighbors flower bed, I see a semi drive up to my house with half of a modular home. Then I realized that what I thought was a bifurcated house with beige siding and the word ""Samsung"" written all over it was actually my new flatscreen TV. I looked down at my dog, Tex, to see how he was making out and thought ""Wow is that thing massive"". The TV was really big, too.\n  It took the engineering firm I hired about a week to unpack and set up, and it wasn't cheap. Did you know they take credit cards? I do now! So anyway, just as I'm preparing to school some wise ass Malaysian pipsqueaks, someone started annoyingly ringing my doorbell. After about the seventh or fifteenth ring, I almost got off the couch to see who was there, when, luckily, my wife, Mimi, awoke after working a double shift and crying herself to sleep worrying about our missing son, Jimmy, and rushed to the door. Unfortunately for her it was the police who were there to arrest her for what they called unprecedented credit card fraud. Doubly unfortunate for her they spotted the meth lab I had set up in my daughter Kimmy's room, and because the mortgage for the house was in her name, she took the rap. Unfortunately for me, I was forced to leave my house and new TV by the Hazmat team the police called in to clean up my wife Bibi's meth lab.\n  Damn, my life sucked. Where would I play Xbox now! And then it came to me - my only brother Ro and his wife Jen rented an apartment a few miles away, so I got my dog, Ajax, and sped off in my wife's 1986 Toyota Tercel, frantically thinking of some way to talk my brother Joe into buying a massive TV for me to play video games on. By the time I arrived at their apartment, I had come up with not only an undeniably rational reason to buy an 85"" TV, but also, considerately, a way for them to pay for it. Moe's wife, Bren, had recently given birth to their first child, Troy. On the black market, he had to be worth fifty grand, easy. That would leave an extra ten grand to buy a lot of new games for the new Xbox One console. For some odd reason they seemed perturbed and asked me to leave. As I left Bro and Jan's apartment I realized why they seemed so angry - they were Playstation fanboys! Geez, did I screw up! On top of that I had left my car keys in their apartment. Having no desire to face their wrath, I decided to hot wire my wife's 2012 BMW 6 series, which, talk about weird coincidences, is the same model car my brother Nero's wife, Nan, drives.\n  And so, there I was, homeless, wifeless, childless, and most of all, 85""-4K-LED-TV-120Hz-less! There was, however, a silver lining - I still had the box the TV came in, and so, today, thank you Samsung, my dog, Anthrax and I are not homeless! I just wish this box came with more outlets and a bigger kitchen, although a guy I know told me it's not that costly to add some more. What's weird is that I forget his name.

Yes, it plays PS2 games about as well as they can be played I suppose, though I still think the picture quality could be improved and I have yet to find a place to plug the HDMI cable into my PS2.  So, a good choice for the money, but just be warned that Walmart is not stocking this particular model.  Not even Target is!  WTF?;Will it play PS2 games? Sort of
484;1377.0;5.0;5.0;After a couple of years of watching movies here, rather than spending money for the movie theaters, I've managed to almost get my money's worth. Only $39,000 left to go.;better than the movies
486;1378.0;5.0;5.0;I thought about purchasing a property, car, and having some money left over, but then I saw this super ultra awesome picasso. I said aloud, why invest in property when I could live in the awesome box that came with this Samsung. I went to the local nuclear reactor so I could plug this bad boy in. After almost causing nuclear meltdown the TV turned on and vaporized almost everything within 100 miles. So I decided to spend another 20K$ on some special glasses to withstand the wonderful deathrays this thing emits. Also I got some Uraniplutonium batteries to power the remote from a nearby group of extra terrestrials for selling out mankind. Man, I am sure happy I didn't waste my $ on properties or cars or savings lol Great buy, by the way do not forget to get the PSXBoxwii 1million it works excellently with this set.;Better than houses, further education, and $
487;1379.0;4.0;5.0;Everything I have bought from Samsung has been good. From the tiny 'phones to the several digital cameras. However there is one tiny flaw with this device. It not only costs more than my house and car combined, I would have to work for 16 years to make enough money to buy it...and I am betting that in the year 2030 they will have a thing like a green CSO wall in every room of your house anyway so you can see messages beamed in by the totalitarian Microsoft or Google who has by then taken over our world.\nHence, only 4 stars.;Gotta be good
503;1380.0;4.0;5.0;I like the teevee, but the price was a bit of a hardship. I had to lay off one of the crew members of my yacht for the winter, and sell my pet rats for food.;It was worth it
528;1381.0;5.0;5.0;Just bought it last night, its really freaking sweet, I lobe the resolution, the picture, the smart T.V functions on it, the fact I sold my life to Satan in order to get this T.V. Yup, my current life is so boring, its not a 85inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED UHDTV... So I can enjoy watching Justin Beiber getting arrested while having a cocktail with Satan! Thanks Samsung!!;The future is now!

541;1383.0;5.0;5.0;Love it. When I get bored, I take it outside to create an eclipse for my town. No more waiting 8 years. We do it weekly. I just hope Samsung takes this type of format and technology to all their products....phones, ovens, dishwashers...the larger the better.;Love it.
574;1384.0;4.0;5.0;Listen up people, When i bought this tv it was out of spite, because my wife kept bugging me to loose weight and get healthier instead of sitting around all the time. Well since i bought the tv, i learned more about my life than i ever thought possible. How to change the oil from popular tv shows that i can actually watch clearer now. I lost 180 lbs just buy doing what i always did. don't ever cut yourself short. be who you are and fight the good fight.\n\nas far as the wife still nagging, where did you think the 180 lbs went.\n\nBest move i ever made;Life Changing

Then this monstrosity showed up in the recommendations list and I HAD to get it to maximizes my TV experience.\n\nAnd low and behold, the almighty came through the front door and now I am left in awe. With blistering 4K resolution at a size that even Mount Everest would be jealous of, your brain will start to wonder why people didn't invent graphics cards for your eye balls just so it could keep up with technology.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating thing about it is how it seamlessly pulls you into the reality of all your entertainment mediums whether it's movies or video games. Try reading your favorite book in digital format and even the text will start to tell the story in a way that not even nostalgia can bring to life. Watching national geographic on this TV makes you feel like you might as well google image your next vacation spot instead of dealing with the hassles of traveling there . With 82 inches of absolute immersion, it makes you wonder why you should continue with the daily duties life when you can just play second life with this and live the dream that you have always wanted this technological titan.\n\nWith so many pixels in the screen, it makes you wonder whether Samsung was in a competition with the galaxy on how many dots it could fit in a single viewable plane. This product is indeed a monument of all humanities historical accomplishments. If Leonardo da Vinci were here, he would give up on science and take up Photoshop just so he can remaster his masterpieces in true 4K HD. So why wait? Make a masterpiece of your living room and buy this RIGHT NOW!;At first, I bought an XBOX ONE.....
611;1387.0;5.0;5.0;I put it on my credit card I bought from 'Target.cn/creditcard'. Before it was delivered, I ordered 2 more and sent them to McCain's office  and  set up a meeting with the Arizona Better Gubrnment Klub. They were so impressed they gave him back his GOP endorsement. He was so impressed he's ordering one for every military base in Afghanistan at $400k each. The GOP is buying one for each and every C-17 in the Air Force as nothing is too good for our troops. Especially this close to Super Bowl Sunday.;Great buy

The only way to hife from my guilt is to spend triads amount of money on items like a 15 inches shy of a 100 inch TV. Plus the HUGE box makes an amazing cover for my yacht.

724;1393.0;1.0;5.0;Well it just goes to show that you simply can't hesitate in the race with the Joneses! Unlike many other reviewers here I'd decided to be sensible and save up first.

She then began crying and muttering about tentacles and old ones, but the line went fuzzy and disconnected. Terrible service.\nAn acquaintance told me that they'd seen one heading to an electronics store in our neighbourhood, but apparently the delivery driver had passed the local zoo and caused a riot in the monkey house when one of the chimps picked up an old branch and began smashing his dinner bowl with it. The last anybody heard was someone yelling that it was full of stars (I'm guessing they were watching the Grammy broadcast, lucky buggers).\nThere was one bit of good news though. I learned yesterday that the mining magnate in the next town had bought one, and it just so happens that the lounge room wall I knocked down in preparation for my own gives me a clear line of sight to theirs. I lose the corners of the picture around the sides of my walls of course, and am limited to watching what they want ('Grand Designs: Poor People Foreclosures Series', 'Private Island Makeover' and 'Antiques Roadshow' seem to be favourites) which should at least tide me over until they can restock.\nFor now though I'm extremely unhappy and starting to wonder if I should perhaps go out and make some friends instead.;Out of stock?!

I would have gotten one of these a long time ago, but it took forever for my homeowners association to approve bringing something this big into the neighborhood.\n\nRead the fine print though, I was disappointed to find that there were no connections compatible with my BetaMax, and now I might have to move to VHS, :(;Great Picture, but read the details.

869;1402.0;5.0;5.0;This tv has a phenomenal picture with the extremely limited amount of actual 4K content available for it. It offers great sound and is sized for the most immersive viewing experience.\n\nHow did I afford this tv you ask?\n\n  Being the complete irrational early adopter that I am, I decided this tv was worth more than my wife. After all, this thing must be a chick-magnet which would ensure a quick replacement. First, I attempted to poison my wife's drink with roofie. Somehow our drinks got mixed up and I woke up 2 days later with a banana in my rectum and my dog humping my face. Next, I tried to suffocate her with a pillow while she was asleep. She woke up, sprang out of bed, threw a kick and broke my nose. I told her that her breath was causing me great displeasure.\n\n  My next attempt was to run her over with my car while she was jogging. I crept behind her as she was jogging, but it happened to be someone else with similar workout gear. My car is totaled and I am facing manslaughter charges. After that, I attempted to come from behind and slit her throat. She mule kicked me in the groin and elbowed be in the mouth, knocking my 2 front teeth out.\n\n  Ironically, she took me out to dinner and died of embarrassment with my zigzag mosquito nose and hillbilly grill. I got the life insurance settlement and ordered this right away. This Samsung tv was so worth every penny, my car, my freedom, spousal death and physical deformation that I had to go through to get it. Not to mention, it is nearly impossible to bring a woman home with no car or front teeth, so my hands have become rather calloused as of late.;A great tv. Out with the wife, in with the Samsung!

908;1406.0;1.0;5.0;First of all for the price,  This means that I paid ten thousand dollars for each K.  And they're not even fair about it. I asked if I could get only 1k and they said that if I don't buy all 4 then it's twelve thousand each.  What kind of a scam are they running? I don't even have cable. And all it would use is 2 ks anyway, even if I did. But I just have my trusty old antenna which gives me 1k resolution.  In the end I couldn't deal with the hassle and just shelled out for all 4 Ks.

As a thoughtful caretaker of his home I made the executive decision to do some shopping using his account, I'm sure the next time he walks in the door from a trip he too will be impressed by the size and picture clarity.;Very Excited!

Thankfully I came upon this deal when I did, as I needed all 3 of them in order to build my iMax theater in the screening room I just added onto my Quonset Hut here in the Trailer Park.\n\nYou would not believe the hassles I had to endure dealing with the Trailer Park and Town Planning Commission in order to build the extension, but when I promised to set aside every Thursday night for special showings of Captan EO (BYO3DG) alternating with The Wizard of Oz ( Just three words - Dorothy's Ruby Slippers!) they practically begged me to take the building permit and help expedite the construction!\n\nThe only complaint I have heard so far is on nights were we might be having heavy rains, sleet or hail.  As we all know, no matter how GOOD the PICTURE on any of these HD units (4K Ultra or not), the sound is always lagging behind (I liken it to a transistor radio in a Bentley).  The din of the rain, sleet or hail pounding on the tin of the Quonset Hut means we have to turn on the Closed Captions to insure everyone is able to keep up with the story-lines.  Again, another testament to the quality of these Samsung units is the clarity and ease of reading those captions - second to none!\n\nI would highly recommend anyone looking to up the resale value of their property to invest in one or more of these units...right now our trailer park has a ""wait"" list a mile long and growing by the minute.  I am hopeful that in time, I will be able to move into a first rate  double-wide with a Jacuzzi - but for now the toothless smiles of all the folks as they leave the theater and make their way back to their trailers is reward enough!\n\nThank you Amazon for making life here in the Trailer Park just that much sweeter!";Who said Tornadoes are God's way of saying never live in a Trailer Park?!
1119;1432.0;4.0;5.0;I must say this TV has changed my life...  Actually, it changed many people's lives here in Charming.  My husband Jax wanted his club to start making better changes, so he quit selling AK 47's.  He was able to jack a few UPS trucks that were delivering these bad boys to the rich and turn them for a profit.\n\nThe niner's and Mayans are fighting over who gets to buy these shipments from my man's club.  There has been much blood shed over these bad boys.  Abe and I are happy that daddy is selling these rather then the automatic weapons.\n\nThe ATF no longer bothers us since this is out of their jurisdiction.  Now we deal with NSA watching and listening to everything we do.  Pffft... Who cares though?  They listen to everyone, so we aren't that special.\n\nWe did find it rather difficult to use this as a weapon when the Mayans came to our church meeting.  It took many of SAMCRO's men to push it towards those scheming thieves.  This TV killed all of the Mayan's that day...\n\nThe Irish are mad that we made a business pact with the Japanese... Oh well, they will get over it soon enough;Screw selling automatic weapons, these are worth more on the black market

Now I'm sitting in what's left of my house (basically the framework) I have it leaned up against some boards that used to be my neighbor Ralph's handicap ramp (his house was leveled so now his place is all a ground floor unit) and they absolutely REFUSE to let me return the convenient ""wall mount kit"" citing that my no longer having walls isn't a good enough reason for return. On the plus side it came very well boxed and the box it came in I donated to the American Red Cross and it housed three of my homeless neighbors.....but still your return policy sucks!

My laundry business is doing so well, I figured what the hell. A pair of drones delivered it right to my balcony and and I had my neighbor Mr Bentley help me install it. The colors on this thing are beautiful and pop. The only problem I'm having is that my wife Louise AKA Weezee and my maid Florence just sit at home all day and watch the TV.\n\nJorge Jefferson;Moving on up, to a Deluxe TV.
1127;1435.0;3.0;5.0;I only bought this since it was listed as an Amazon Prime item, I hate paying shipping.  The item arrived promptly and was well packaged.  Unfortunately, we had to remove a wall to get it in our house, but I didn't really like that wall anyway.  After unpackaging the TV, I happened to notice it costs $55 per year in energy costs, FOLKS, THAT'S ALMOST $5 A MONTH IN ADDED ELECTRICITY.  Regretfully, I had to return this TV for a 'greener' version.  Amazon, as usual, provided excellent support and allowed me to return the TV no questions asked.;Nice TV, but beware the added energy costs!!!!
1139;1436.0;5.0;5.0;I can't wait for this thing to get here! I'm going ahead and giving it five stars ahead of actually using it because for this price I know its good.\n\nI hope my backyard is big enough for the super drone they're going to need to deliver it!;Show me the pixels!
1140;1437.0;5.0;5.0;"I'm just so bored, bored, bored all the time, so my ex, Jay, bought one of these and mounted it on his pier, facing my dock.  I will say that the picture is excellent-- even from across the bay. However, he chooses to play the strangest films.  I can't go out on my veranda to sip a gin fizz without watching another ""Blood on the Highway"" safety video. I'd complain, but the clothing commercials have me absolutely riveted, darling: I swear I have never seen such beautiful shirts.  The resolution on the screen makes the shirts look virtually three dimensional.\n\nAnyway, Tom says he *might* purchase one to watch all of his ridiculous sports programs, but he wants a custom option: white trim with Samsung in teeny, tiny gold script lettering.  Won't that just be darling?  I've always been partial to white and gold.  Besides, I think Pammy will enjoy watching cartoons on a large screen.

1148;1439.0;2.0;5.0;Good news, bad news. The screen size enables me to see even the vanishingly small hope that UVA might beat Virginia Tech and possess the Commonwealth Cup. However the super HD resolution meant that the 5 year warranty expired before I was able to document the three dead pixels in the top left quadrant. It was the twinkle in Sandra Bullock's eye -- dimmed by more than 0.00014 lumens during Miss Congeniality that i had the proof required by customer service. Quality control cost this unit one star, and the level of customer service cost this unit another two. Are these extended warranties ever worthwhile? I cannot wait for the advance on my autobiography so I can replace this defective unit with a solid built-in-the-USA RCA (so much easier to notice when a vacuum tube dies than a pixel, and the HD down converter is an absolute bargain at $49.95).\n\nTech Experience: high from 1979-1984;Three dead pixels not covered under the $18k extended warranty

1181;1441.0;5.0;5.0;"I moved from a 110"" projector system to this screen.  The picture on this product is truly amazing and the cost definitely worth it.  However, after some thought, this gave me pause.  Perhaps there is too much value?  Why are companies so anxious to get these into the publics hands, that they would offer it at an absurdly low price?  After some thinking, it came to me, and it has far reaching implications to civilization as we know it. (spoiler)\n\nThe reason the image is so real, is that it is in fact, real.  Engineers have been working on teleportation technology for ages, and at long last this is the first consumer-available end-portal device.  For the time being I suspect the portal will operated in ""read-only"" mode.  Viewers are treated to amazing vistas that do not come from encoded video, but reality itself.\n\nWith the amazing price-point, these devices will soon appear in everywhere.  They'll be in your home, bar, doctor's offices, work, schools etc..  When the saturation point is reached, endless ecommerce possibilities can begin.  Drones delivering your online purchases? ...nope, it will just come through your home ""TV"".  Booking a flight to a far off land?  Why bother, just swivel the device on the swivel stand ($5K extra) and step over to the other side.\n\nI'm sure some reading will begin to panic.  With every technology there is the good and the bad.  Regardless, I think we are at the begging of the next big thing in ""TV"" technology, and I can't wait.\n\n(Ps, TV is definitely in read-only mode still...I've repeatedly put objects on the screen, and they will not go through yet)";A TV for every home...

Someone talks about his boyfriends' new job, someone else is wearing really cute shoes and of course I had to outdo them with this giant TV.  I live in a small apartment.  My roommate, I and my boyfriend now all live on our balcony as the TV takes up what used to be the living room/kitchen.  The bedrooms are now storage rooms for the furniture we used to use, but that's ok cause we can't open those doors anymore.  And though we can only eat take out now, since the box this thing came in is permanently wedged in the kitchen, things are looking up.  Since we lost the cat a couple weeks ago, we have more time to see the tv through the sliders from our sleeping bags on the balcony so other than the frostbite it's like we're on a vacay every day!;I gotta stop drinking
1224;1445.0;5.0;5.0;I purchased this because I wanted to sit at my parents house.. 11 towns away, and still be able to see crystal clear football games, thru their livingroom window.  It has only cost me my house, car, kids college fund, and 401K, but hey You only live once, and 85 > 1 in my book..\n\nWhat they don't tell you, is Samsung sends hot models to stand next to it so when people come over your house they gawk even more..\n\nAs far as the Smart Apps, nothing screams $$$ then opening up Facebook on it and seeing someone you dated 20 years ago, who is now HUGE, Fill a 4K Screen..

1230;1446.0;5.0;5.0;After reading all the excellent reviews of this massive TV, I think I'll just save up some of my EBT money and slap this baby on the card.  I mean why not? The only job I can get is a job flippen burgers for minimum wage and that doesn't do much to support my baby momma.  After all, what better way to keep my kids entertained while I'm gettin mine with the ladies next door.

Nah-mean?;Get this TV for yo Baby Momma
1235;1447.0;5.0;5.0;I decided to buy this TV for the sole reason of being able to write a review on it because it just seems like all the other reviews are fake and it really isn't fair to the people strongly considering the purchase. I financed it with the Amazon Store Card interest free for 60 years. I mean how could you not pass up on 720 easy monthly payments of $55. I mean if I invest $39,999.99 now and earn interest on it over those 60 years it basically pays for itself. Silly Amazon and your interest free financing. A word of advice is to definitely make sure you choose the 720 month option at checkout because if you choose 24 months by accident you might need to sell your car or take out a home equity loan, unless you already did that to buy some other necessity. I also recommend taking out or increasing your life insurance coverage to cover the cost of the TV so that your beneficiaries may enjoy it for years to come if you end up no longer able to make the monthly payments. It was 'eligible' for free shipping though which was great but only became eligible after doing some things that I would rather not speak of.\n\nTV works great!;Thank you Amazon!

1239;1449.0;5.0;5.0;The Samsung 85-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz 3D Smart LED TV has no equal.  We bought four - one for each the children and one for the kitchen.  The kids have never been happier - we were moving their furniture around but then realized the ceiling was the best spot to mount them.  Instead of reading to them now we just watch a few movies with them in bed. Two of our children are left handed and thankfully, Samsung developed the left-handed remote for their Ultra Smart. No more arguing at the dinner table as a result.  Our lives couldn't be happier.  There is a rumour that Samsung will be selling the Samsung 120-Inch 10K Uber HD 600 MHz 5D Smart LED TV in January - lots of room in the family room and basement for this baby.

Let me say, these devices are so superior to the ones we replaced as they truly show with absolute clarity both the arcing trajectories of the ICBMs and their ""simulated"" blast radii. All of my co-workers could easily see from their workstations as the game played out.\n\nOnce we went into gaming mode, however, the left and right sets did not really serve much purpose, and while the center set's whites and blacks were top notch, I couldn't help but feel we'd overbought for such a simple game interface as Tic Tac Toe.";In short, I'd piss on a spark plug if I thought it would do any good to buy a bigger set.

While perusing through Amazon's rather disappointing selection, I came across this bad boy. How, you say? Because I'm a bearded man who would never look at purses to begin with, I go straight to electronics. I need this Herculean piece of technology for myself. After checking the specs, I was confident it wasn't controlled by NSA {Team Edward (Snowden) here}, but rather what God used to DVR our sins and Breaking Bad with. In an attempt to feel Christlike and closer to God, I purchased it on a whim. Running low on funds and at my credit limit, I did what I do every year: I bought it during Daylight Savings Time. If you buy something online in an hour that never existed, the system recognizes the purchase but never charges you. Boom! I found the frequency, Kenneth! Anyway, back to my discontent wife... With the money I saved, I bought a ceiling mount for this puppy and, since I do all the work, she doesn't even notice I only last 2 minutes anymore. I'm merely a commercial break to her.

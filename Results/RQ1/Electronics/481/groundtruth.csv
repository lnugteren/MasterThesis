274;1.0;5.0;2468.0;Very realistic image!  I took an HD video of my garage door opening, then placed my new Samsung UN105S9 in front of my garage and pressed play as my wife was coming home.  She drove straight through the TV!  Ha Ha!  I got her!;Awesome image clarity!

Dang try didn't tell me I would have to pay so much each month but it's worth it and though it's a lot it will be paid off faster then expected!\n\n*update 2*\nSo I just found out that $4557.83 went to pay interest and the remaining $442.17 was applied to the principle. What ever I still have the TV!!!\n\n*update 3*\nSo it's been 10 months and I just got a letter stating my house is going into foreclosure, I've had to resort to dumpster diving for food, my wife left me and took our two kids (fortunately I sold all our valuables, furniture, and assets to make the first 4 payments before she left) but I just got a letter from Samsung saying that they will reduce my monthly payment $4850 dollars a month if I will give them 3 organs and or body parts out of a list of 20. I signed immediately and now have 24 hours to make my selection.\n\n*update 4*\nI have decided to go with a kidney, my left arm, and my testicles.

344;17.0;5.0;172.0;I bought this an extra monitor for my chromebook for business meetings. It is excellent and the presentations looks amazing from so close. I also hired 6 people to lug it around to different meeting rooms.;Created jobs after purchasing this....

366;20.0;5.0;152.0;After Apple released the iPhone 6 Plus I was really disillusioned by Samsung. I was so content with being able to laugh at my Apple friends because they didn't have a tablet to put up to their head and make calls. I no longer had the stupidest, largest gadget to make calls with. Now my Apple buddies look just as moronic. Screw that dumb stuff, Samsung really delivered with this TV, it's the next big thing!!! Buyer beware, I recommend talking into it in landscape mode because of the built-in kick stand, there's slight discomfort when I lift it up to my ear because I now have to carry a step stool with me, but that's ok. With my Galaxy phablet I already sacrificed my procreation to a life of 2nd cousin-only matrimony so go big or go home, yes? Besides the built-in kick stand, portrait or landscape grip, and multiple multimedia inputs I really enjoy that I can also plug in a memory card to store my data. No longer do I have to lug around my external hard drive (geez, what a pain!), all I need now is my Phelevision and that's all. Check out these fotos of my smokin hot wife and some dude with lipstick to see how super convenient it is. Super convenient.;The next big thing is here!!!!
302;21.0;3.0;150.0;I work as a park ranger for the Grand Canyon and it is nice watching TV from the other side. Unfortunately it does not come with the nuclear power plant required to power it. If they could make a bundle, then five stars.;Great tv, but....

340;23.0;5.0;141.0;I cashed in my pennies at a Coinstar and bought this as a stocking stuffer for my friend who lives at the top of the beanstalk growing in my backyard. Transporting it was easy, I just strapped it to my dog Clifford.;Great stocking stuffer!

468;30.0;5.0;127.0;Student loans had me in debt up to my eyeballs, so I figured whats another 120,000 grand. But this, this is the best money I've ever spent. I can now watch whatever I want while I sit at home with a degree and no job.;Best purchase ever
390;31.0;5.0;125.0;Myself and 1000 of my closest friends recently purchased this unit to share on a weekly basis. A lot of friends have given it raving reviews and they are definately the talk of the town.  My turn is the week of April 8th 2019, i am sure it will be worth the wait and i only had to shell out $119.99 plus tax, great deal if you ask me. Stop by if you are in the area then cause the party i will throw will be legendary;1000 Friends
407;32.0;1.0;119.0;This ad is totally misleading!  I thought I was getting a good deal but, come to find out, 119,999.99 is virtually the same thing as 120,000.00.  I haven't seen such dirty tactics since the sub-prime housing debacle.  I would give zero stars but the system is not set up like that.;BUYER BEWARE!!!!
216;33.0;5.0;105.0;I was saving up for the last 20 years to fund my wedding in Hawaii, but I figured this Samsung TV would last much longer so now I am happily single and can watch cartoons all night. Really happy. Thank you Samsung for giving a new meaning to life;Lasts longer than a wedding
234;34.0;5.0;99.0;Fits all the cells of my spreadsheet but annoying that I have to use my living room rug as a mouse pad. But, I've lost 50 pounds since. Overall, it does the job and I'm glad I purchased this. It was between this and a Mac, but I couldn't justify Apple's price-gouging tactics.;Great for Excel with One Complaint
439;35.0;4.0;101.0;Size is similar to my iPhone 6 plus. Curve is similar to my iPhone 6 plus after a night in skinny jeans. At this price point it should have included the Chinese laborers who built the TV as live in staff. Its not even worth returning it so I just put it out by the curb. FYI, in the two days that I had it my electric bill went up $173.;Meh

342;38.0;1.0;88.0;I recommend buying not one tv but 2 and surrounding yourself with them which will create an immersive virtual reality in which you still own a house.;only for the peasants
447;39.0;1.0;88.0;Only a 1 star..because after maxing out my credit cards on cash withdrawal, taking out several loans with the payday companies, taking out a second mortgage, selling my mother's house, selling my mother, trading my kidneys for cash on the black market, selling one of my testicles to a Chinese herbalist, issuing threats, intimidation, blackmail and indulging in the sort of behaviour usually seen on Black Friday to buy this obscenely decadent TV...can you imagine how annoyed I was to discover that it can't be shipped to the UK??\n\nMajor fail Amazon and Samsung. Major fail.;Bitterly disappointed..
215;40.0;5.0;82.0;Everything about this television is so reasonable except delivery. I got them to test out the new drone delivery system to my front door for small items but they just dropped it out of a military plane through my roof.;Poor delivery

480;42.0;5.0;6.0;I don't understand all of the sarcastic reviews? I purchased this TV to SAVE money! Now that I can play my home movie on this incredible television.....the money I'm saving has paid off this TV five times over! My junk looks so big now, I don't have to buy anymore erectile medication! This TV has increased the size of my junk 20 times more than my medication......even when I'm not aroused! Plus, the 3D feature just adds to the benefit of purchasing this tv! Best investment EVER! Now.....if Samsung would sell a bigger tv to help me pull my head out of my ass.....my life would be complete! I really hope this review helps everyone that is considering purchasing this TV at an amazing price!\n\nLast Detail: The ONLY issue with this tv, and I promise it's the ONLY issue......my junk now curves to the left or right.....just depends on which way I'm facing. Strange....haven't figured out how to correct this slight flaw.\n\nI really hope whoever buys this TV will feel like their life s complete! The money you just spent compensated for your little wee wee!  :);Best Purchase EVER!
245;43.0;5.0;70.0;I sold both my kidneys on the vietnamese black market for 200,000 to afford this TV.  I live with a dialysis machine attached to my body but it was totally worth it.  Now I watch all my shows in crystal clear HD, and gaming is awesome.  And I only s*** blood once a week.;and gaming is awesome. And I only s*** blood once a week
450;44.0;5.0;72.0;Overall an excellent TV for the price. Color and black levels are comparable to other high-end UHD models (among all brands, not just Samsung), and the smart functionality is among the best currently available in my opinion. My only complaint doesn't even have to do with the TV but with Amazon. One-click ordering is not available for this item which is an inconvenience for my assistant every time she buys one.;Excellent TV, But No One-Click Ordering?!
405;45.0;1.0;70.0;RETURNING. Does NOT come with built in VHS player. WHAT A WASTE.;WHAT A WASTE.

381;47.0;2.0;65.0;These are factory seconds, the good ones are NOT curved.  BUYER BEWARE!;Shop around first
380;48.0;5.0;60.0;Bought this for a Christmas present for the Wife because she likes big things. Then I discovered it was too big to fit under the Christmas tree. I had a difficult decision to make. Return it or find bigger tree. So I went to California and got myself a Giant Redwood! Not sure if it was illegal to cut one down, but who cares! Samsung probably already killed a giant tree to construct the box it came in. I tied the Redwood to the roof of my Smart car and drove it home. The tree just barely fit under my 400 foot roof. But now the tv fits nicely under the tree. Everything has worked out perfectly!;Too big to fit under Christmas tree
330;49.0;5.0;56.0;"Very reasonable for the TV but the HDMI cable cost another $2 which is over my budget, I just use an 9"" portable TV now.";Very reasonable for the TV but the HDMI cable cost ...
266;50.0;3.0;54.0;Help. This TV fell on me and several guests at a dinner party. We're all alive thanks to the curve but we cant get out. Also the channel is stuck on Fox and the remote is out of our reach so we're getting dumber by the minute.;Get me out of here
470;51.0;5.0;54.0;I stole mine. Best move I ever made. Factority security was virtually nonexis- hang on, someone's knocking on my door... brb.;Why pay?
277;52.0;5.0;51.0;Even though I've never used the TV to watch a show or movie I feel I'm uniquely qualified to provide an honest and fair review of this amazing TV: As a World Renown Therapists* I bought the Samsung to use as part of my vagino-immersion regression therapy, where I take patients back to the time of their birth in order to reset their mental state. In the latter part of the treatment we quietly place the patient in a dark room with the temperature set to 101.6 degrees. The patient is naked and slathered with petroleum jelly from head to toe, and then  put into an extra small sleeping bag. We then ask the patient to curl into a ball and lie on the floor for 90 minutes after which they can remove themselves from the sleeping bag. After 90 minutes we turn the room temperature down to 73.2 degrees and the Samsung is quickly turned on-to display a stunningly, massive, 105 inch high-definition close-up of the glory that is womanhood at an impressive 16:9 aspect ratio with a 120 hertz refresh rate. The size, clarity, and life-like details of this image overwhelm the patient and triggers a change in their mental state to where the patient is transported back to the moment of their birth and delivery. At this point the patients become squirmy and slack-jawed gazing at the huge image of the birth canal, we then slap the patient on their behind which resets the patients mental state and clears the id, ego, & superego  allowing the patient to be spiritually reborn. I've tried Magnavox, and Sony, and for my money the Samsung is the way to go.\n\n*(not Really);A Therapeutic Viewing Experience
465;53.0;5.0;52.0;I have been dreaming of buying an Audi R8 for quite some time now. However, at a starting price of $115, 900 I wasn't sure if it was worth it. Then, I found this TV. For just $4k more, I can now experience the R8 from the comfort of my own home any time I want. It's so lifelike, it's actually better than real life. As an extra bonus, I have now been saved the effort of repeatedly walking to my garage to see my R8. Also, I now have more time to reflect on my poor life decisions and eat my feelings away. Thanks Samsung!;it's actually better than real life

343;55.0;2.0;45.0;I had decided to buy this fine example of technology's blessing on humankind, and went to my vault to get the funds. I decided to take a swim in my sea of gold coins as a celebration for my purchase when I suddenly remembered this was only 120Hz!!! This is the equivalent of slapping the face of God with the insolence of poor engineering design. No dice Samsung. No dice.;Not so 'refresh'-ing
6;56.0;1.0;5.0;NO gift wrapping....NO gift wrapping!?!?  I expect it to be gift wrapped in the fur of pure white kittens for $120 grand!  I was going to buy two but if I have to pay the maids to wrap them for my two illegitimate children then I'm not buying it.  Also what about this signature being required!?!?  My maids do not speak English!!!!  How am I supposed to get the thing?!?!  The price is great but these inconveniences are just too much for me!;The price is great but these inconveniences are just too much for me
459;57.0;3.0;45.0;I decided to go for the returned TV for $118,000 but it was so big it wouldn't fit in my Amazon cart. What a bummer!;Cart was too small.
466;58.0;5.0;44.0;At first i was on the fence but with the FREE shipping how could you pass this deal up? You also get 2% back in rewards! The SAVINGS are endless... ENDLESS;Best TV in it's price range
72;59.0;5.0;34.0;Listen, if ANYONE else is on the fence about purchasing this item for a son/daughter about to enter grade school, then search under 'tools & home improvement', buy yourself a basic function chainsaw (free shipping with amazon prime!) and cut that fence to oblivion because Samsung has succeeded, once again, in nailing a product for the masses!\n\nI've made some incredibly wise purchasing decisions in my life, but this one really elevated my status amongst my friends and, to be honest, the entire NYC social scene.\nI paid for expedited shipping because the difference between 1 day and 2 days is about 24 hours and I simply can't justify waiting that long....not for something like this.  The unit came as expected and along with a team of 4 samsung (they may have been interns but I don't speak Korean so i'm not sure) employees who unpacked everything, set it up, made lunch, then dinner....then, curiously, set up air mattresses (the bunk type...high end) and retired for the night.  It wasn't much of an issue for myself but after 2 weeks I did have to call Samsung's customer service number to have someone retrieve them.\n\nPicture quality, refresh rate, black levels, white levels, and shades of grey (less than 50 but still acceptable) were all as advertised.  Chip and Dale rescue rangers have never before looked so large and grainy on the VHS to DVD transfer....but now they are the size of my kid so at least when it's on it's as if she has some friends over that I don't have to pay attention to!....that in itself is worth half the price of this piece of curvy art.\nSome of you have mentioned build quality and I feel the need to interject in that I find it to be a more than solid piece!  The length, width and curvature has completely negated the need for a dedicated child's bed so I put that on craigslist and now just turn this thing on it's back at night time and let it do it's magic.....the screen heats up just enough to warm my precious little one so that I don't have to have the heat in the apartment up as high which saves me soooooo much money....it's like this thing just pays for itself!  (There is a film screen you can get to cover this....much like the ones for cell phones and I HIGHLY recommend this if you plan on doubling it as a bed as it is waterproof....I doubt I need to explain this further).\n\nI could go on and on regarding this state of the art tv but most of what I'd be saying has already been covered so i'll leave you with a recap list of the highs and lows.\n\nPros:\n- Decent screen size\n- Will induce envy in friends/acquaintances\n- Doubles as furniture\n- Reduces utility usage\n- Comparable cost to a small rural house\n\nCons:\n- Impossible to get the curved screen straightened out....I must have a defective one but it's not a huge deal\n- Manual has no pictures\n- Mediocre remote\n- Still not as good as the iPhone\n- Wanted 4,000 Ultra HD but have to settle for 4K with this model\n\n*One side note, since I live in a 'cozy' NYC apartment, the box which this was shipped in actually doubled as an addition to our place....almost added 35% more livable square footage!....made the mistake of owning up to this with my tax lawyer and now i'm having zoning issues and likely will be facing some fines.  Don't say you weren't warned.;Because I want my child to have the things I didn't have growing up.....

401;61.0;5.0;40.0;Well after much soul searching, I decided to buy this TV. I charged it to my Discover Card so I will get a $1,200 cash back bonus which I intend to use to buy lottery tickets so I might be able to afford the payment when the bill come in. I might bet some on the Oakland Raiders to win the Super Bowl. I however can not afford cable or satellite any longer so I will just use it as a monitor for my Commodore 64.;Best Purchase since that Enron stock.
48;62.0;5.0;24.0;I was looking for an affordable second monitor for the home office and this one was perfect. I can now see my computer screen from every room in the house and even from the backyard. I am not sure how I lived without this before. I did have to buy a bigger desk to accommodate this thing and knock out a wall in the office but it was well worth it.\n\nExtra bonus, I feel asleep in front of this thing the other day and when I woke up I had a nice sun tan on one side of my face. Gonna do the other side tonight.;Good Affordable Second Monitor

221;64.0;5.0;33.0;I decided that this year was a good time to finally buy a new television. I grabbed my m16 automatic, my handy glock 19 and stepped into my local bank to withdraw some cash. I paused for a second to think if I wanted to one or two tvs as I had the bank manager's neck pinned down as I fired my m16 to the ceiling, and politely demanded access to the vault. The lady next to me told me that I should get only one and that no one really needs more than one tv. She was right.\n\nI decided to fill my suitcases with cold hard cash and stepped out of the bank, headed straight to Best Buy and bought it on the spot. Best decision I ever made.;I decided that this year was a good time to finally buy a new television

429;67.0;5.0;33.0;I've lost over 100 pounds. Watching food network is like eating the food in real life now. Also maybe due to atrophy of my limbs because I have not moved in six months because I now live my life through the tv. No need for interactions with other humans. Best thing I ever bought!!!!;Lost over 100 Pounds!!!
264;68.0;5.0;32.0;I already have a theater at my main home in Naples, Florida. But me and my family only turn it on for family night which is every sat night. Anyhow, I wanted something big that I could put in my mountainous vacation home for me and my family to enjoy while on retreat. I didn't want another high end projector to deal with so I took a chance on this tv.\n\nThe picture is spectacular and 4k will blow your mind. Even up close, you can hardly see any pixels or artifacts. Our sitting position is around 10 feet away. Even at 10 feet away, images are razor sharp and pristine. Nevertheless this tv is almost on par with Imax quality. Hence, Samsung did a fine job on this tv. And the curve hightens the experience and makes you feel like you're inside the tv.\n\nIf you're looking for something big, I highly recommend this tv for your home. Especially, if you're looking to get away from a projection system. I'm going to buy another one for our home in Naples. I think this would go perfect in our den next to the Solarium.\n\nI called up best but and had them put a high end Bose system in my den. And I also had them calibrate this set as well. Even the best buy tech was blown away by this set. So we both sat in awe for about 10 mins watching ESPN highlights.\n\nThe sound is spectacular as well. Not bad for tv speakers.;Epic tv & epic picture quality. Me and my family are very pleased.
262;69.0;2.0;31.0;"I used 1-click and ordered this baby, and , amazingly, two days later, an 18-wheel tractor-trailer pulled into my driveway and the driver honked the horn.  I was beside myself with glee.  Eight, 300 pound Guidos, lugged the monster out of the truck and carried it to my front door.  ""Where da ya want it?""  some guy named Tony asked.  In my haste to purchase the set, I failed to measure to see if it would fit through the front door and into my tiny living room.  It didn't...but I was afraid to tell them to take it back...so...they set it up in my front lawn.  I have Directv, with Sunday ticket...man, I was the hit of my town.  I started charging people 20 bucks to sit on my lawn and watch football.  Unfortunately, Directv got wind of this and called the FBI.  Not only was I arrested, water-boarded, forced to strip naked and stay inside a trailer filled with poisonous snakes, but it rained and the set was ruined...the kids in the neighborhood stripped it for parts and sold them on the Black Market...I had to file for bankruptcy...I'm now homeless, eating out of the dumpster...";I started charging people 20 bucks to sit on my lawn andwatch football.

I also like to think this is my way of giving back to them, since they weak/sick will either die or be eaten by some wild animal, this is my way of making sure only the strong survive.

319;72.0;4.0;28.0;Be sure to read the fine print regarding free shipping! Their idea of free shipping means that they will load it on a truck for you but YOU are responsible to pay for the oversized load permits and police escort fees. Unfortunately they would have had to remove power lines, traffic lights and a bridge on the route to my house from the Amazon warehouse local to me.\n\nI did try contacting Aircraft Delivery agencies to have it airdropped to my house but it requires at least a C5 Transport Aircraft due to the large size of the TV and the rates of renting one of them for a day isn't any cheaper than having the bridge removed to have it delivered by land.\n\nNow my TV continues to sit on the dock at the local Amazon warehouse but luckily for me, the Amazon employees were generous enough to supply power to it for me and I can happily watch it from 42 miles away due to the large size of the screen. I do think they are using it as the local Drive In Theater and charging people to watch movies but I don't really care as I don't have to foot the electric bill to power the TV which is equivalent to what it would cost to supply power to a small country. Thanks Amazon and Samsung!;Be sure to read the fine print regarding free shipping

As I viewed the earth from the space station I could clearly see our tv in all it's glory.  I could not believe the clarity of this tv.  Our old 60 inch tv just does not measure up to this beauty!

One minor note of concern though, I put this TV on a 4th floor rooftop deck/ lounge area and enjoyed it for about a week before I was contacted by the FAA  and told to take it down or stop watching porn on it because it was encroaching on airspace and distracting pilots on final approach. Other than that, the remote is pretty easy to lose, I recommend purchasing a second one as backup. At only 34,000 USD a spare remote is a smart decision that will prevent headaches and frustration down the road.;Great TV but check with FAA first!

477;90.0;3.0;24.0;The TV absolutely deserves 5/5 stars, but due to a poor customer service incident I encountered I decided to be one those total douche bags on Amazon that rate a product based on something totally unrelated like customer service or shipping conditions.  I bought this TV just for the f**k of it and it has more than payed for itself!\n  For starters, I work in road maintainence and drive a motor grader (http://www.cat.com/en_US/products/new/equipment/motor-graders/m-series-motor-graders/18552890.html) for a living.  One day the scoop underneath cracked and we weren't able to get a replacement for a week!  The boss was so mad.  Luckily I saved the day when I ran home and brought back my tv.  We rigged that b**ch up to the chassis using a modified wall mount and bingo!  Back to work!  My boss was so excited that he promoted me to forman over the crew so now I can be one of the lazy fat a$$es that lean on a shovel all day and watch others do all the work.  On top of that I got a $3000/year raise.  Talk about return on investment!!!\n  Or maybe I could tell you about how my worthless indoboard (http://indoboard.com/roller_exercises) broke because you need a stupid cylinder to surf on.  So what did I do, just plopped my TV on the ground and was riding that mother all over the place.  I even plugged a camera up to it so I could watch myself riding the TV on my TV.  Incredible!  I can be my own television celebrity now!\n  Oh and this winter my piece of sh*t snow shovel broke.  And was I surprised that it broke...NO!  It didn't cost $120K so obviously it is of low quality and not meant to last.  So what do I do?  I hook that bad a$$ up to the front of my truck and snow plowed the whole neighborhood.  I got so many compliments from the ladies.  This TV has really improved my sex life!\n  So the reason for the 3/5 stars is b/c of a claim I was trying to file with Samsung.  I called them up and explained that the TV had some small scratches on the rear side and wanted to know if this was covered under the waranty.  They asked me for the details surrounding the scratches.  I explained that while using it to parasail off the back of my jon boat, my fata$$ son got tired and wasn't able to paddle fast enough to keep me in the air.  The TV was plundged to the bottom of the lake.  I was able to retreive it a week later with a crane that I borrowed from work.  The TV still works just fine but now there were all these scratches from the rocks on the lake bottom.  They told me that the warranty would absolutely not cover this and was null and void.  Are you sh**ting me!?  Over some d**n scratches!!!  Needless to say this is why only 3/5 stars.\n  But I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great investment!  Hell, due to its gorgeous sickle-like curves, next week I plan on using it to bushhog the field behind the local elementary school while watching porn and drinking a beer!;So close to being 5 Stars

Weeks of selling my ""seed"" and my body on the local street corner were only able raise half the funds neccessary but I did realize I have no natural inhibitions and will try absolutely anything. Still, I needed a new plan.  I went down to my local bingo parlor where I began to fleece senior citizens of their hard earned social security by rigging the games.  This produced not only enough funds for the TV, but also for the platinum installation service and added accessory package!!!

After promptly removing the front of my house, they set to work re-enforceing the wall which this baby would hang on.  3 tons of steel and 20 truckloads of re-enforced concrete later, the wall was ready.  Meanwhile the folks from the nuclear regulatory commission arrived to oversee the installation of the included nuclear reactor.

What a bummer, after my minions set this up in my walk-in closet (my primary TV set needed an old-growth forest cleared just to fit.  This one was so I can catch some news as I'm being dressed, usually of some suffering related to my multi-trillion transnational corporation actively creating gross wage disparity and the trifles of environmentally destructive unchecked profiteering) it was obvious that a small line of pixels were bad.  Maybe Samsung thought I wouldn't notice, boy will he be getting an earfull at the putting green today!  But even on a screen this modest, a few bad pixels are like the Mariana Trench, which, as all big leaguers like myself know, is for dumping neuclear waste from your 'Freedom Research and Tech' department, not a TV screen!  Understandable as it may be, I mean the strategy is to cut as many corners as possible such as wages and materials and most of the time the products are fine, but this was just one of those things.  The one-star is because I had to see the defect myself.  How many whipping boys do I have to go through this morning over this?  I hadn't even eaten my first course of infants before being accosted by this challenge to my absolute power over every little thing in my life because I have more money than God.

To round out the rest we decided to put a reverse mortgage on her mothers house and sell all her jewelry. She is currently suffering from dementia and left us power of attorney.  The caveat was we would take the remaining monies to buy my wife a crocodile skin umbrella for $50000. We met in a bar by the way....... Before receiving our new pride and joy in the mail I had to set my man cave up for its arrival. Since the tv is curved I obviously had to redesign the entire basement around this feature. I got a curved couch, a curved coffee table, a curved wet bar..... Etc etc... And fortunately for us faux wood paneling bends easily so I curved the walls.  We were ready. Our future arrived on our doorstep a few days later with their promoted special shipping. We took it out and had our children hang it on the wall since they were going to have to learn how to be laborers anyway. We plugged it in , turned it on and POW!!!!! My life changed. My family was amazed at the staggering beauty this device offered (although this would be the last time they were allowed down here since it was a man cave.... Maybe when the boys turned 18 ...). Watching the original Ten commandments with Charleton Heston ( not the new too cool for school one with Christian bale) was the obvious choice.  I felt the presence of God and I haven't been to church in over 30 years... Anyway....... What happened was... It seems that there's this obscure criminal element where I live. Bronies. They steal televisions from people's houses to watch my little pony episodes. They can't afford their own tv's because none of them have jobs or at least Internet troll is not a paying job as of yet. They broke into my house while we were at our 5th lacrosse game of the day and ran away with my beloved little child.  It's a smart tv so the tv recorded everything that was happening and sent the information directly to my phone.  I saw a bunch of flabby men in my little pony outfits calling each other pinkie pie and rainbow dash running out of my house with it and then transmission was lost. To make matters worse I was so caught up in watching television that I never filled out the paperwork that came with the television and had no insurance on it. I hired a private detective with the 2% cash back rewards that I receieved from the television purchase which amounted to $2399.9998 until that ran out. Now I cry every night in my curved basement alone.;Bronies stole my television!!!!!!.......

The very first night I was watching a hockey game and switched the screen to ""Dynamic Mode"". Shortly thereafter the smoke detector went off and I notice smoke coming from the cat which was sleeping on the chair closest to the TV. I HIGHLY recommend you do not get this TV if you like cats. Dogs get up an move before catching on fire so there is much less ""drama"" than when your wife comes home and you hand her the cat in a garbage bag. Other than that and the annoying complaints of electrical grid brown outs in my neighborhood in the summer this is the best TV I have ever owned.";Not a TV for cat lovers.

She must have thought it was a mutant because as of this writing she has been hiding under the bed in the master BR for 2 days now and won't be coaxed out even with Beggin Strips.

135;292.0;4.0;7.0;So I bought this tv the other week and I ran into a few minor problems. My wife has breast cancer and the funds were suppose to go towards that but I'm kind of an impulse buyer and it pulled me in. Coming to a realization that this tv will last forever and sadly my wife will not. It's a great buy!;It's a great buy!
45;293.0;5.0;5.0;"So I went to Radio Shack looking for a 4K TV. The employees were pushy, of course. Said something about having a going out of business sale. In fact, they were so pushy that they ended up selling me on this beautiful Samsung UN1-5S9.\n\nIt's the best looking TV I've ever seen, but at 1.4 million it was a little out of my price range. Knowing from past experience how much cheaper things are on Amazon, I decided to check out the online price and, to no surprise, was glad to see a ""low price guarantee"" and a bargain deal of only $119,000 plus tax.\n\nExcited at the prospect of my tax money paying the health insurance of approximately 17 low-income kids, I took the deal. (And as a side note, thanks Obama! Why do these inner city kids expect the government to fund their cancer treatments? My Republican pastor says Jesus would want these children to find a way to pay for their own insurance. He said Jesus would rather see the upper 2% of Americans get a tax break. But I digress.)\n\nUnfortunately, one of the kids from FedEx dropped the box while delivering to my trailer home (couldn't tell who was at fault, as there were at least 10 people carrying it). I had to return it and that item is now available again on Amazon for only $117,000 as one of their Warehouse Deals.";Amazon Low Price Guarantee!

432;295.0;5.0;8.0;My wife is always on my case about my splurge buying on Amazon. She got on me so much that I went and saw a doctor. He diagnosed me with 'Primeitis'. He stated that the best treatment is to cancel my Prime membership and shop at other online stores. He explained that the long wait for my packages will deter me from making splurge purchases on Amazon. Unfortunately, the night before I saw him I purchased this TV. After he diagnosed me, I thought I was on track and my marriage would be saved. The next day, everything came crashing down.\n\nThe knock on the door was greeted by my wife. As I sat on the couch and looked over at the front door, I wondered who was there and then I saw it. This TV was brought in by three workers who gently placed it in my living room. I was in awe and completely drowned out my wife screaming at me at the top of her lungs. I knew once she saw this TV fired up, she would feel the same way I did. Sure enough, she did.\n\nI wasn't able to pay my mortgage anymore because I diverted all my income to paying for this TV. Hopefully, my in-laws won't mind us living here for another 30 years until it's paid off. The speakers are great on this TV.. they drown out my mother-in-law quite well!;The best purchase of my life.

186;311.0;5.0;7.0;I graduated from college almost 3 years ago. I majored in Drama, so naturally I had trouble finding a job. When I found one, you could imagine how happy I was was when I realized that I was going to be paid 45,000 a year to be a customer service representative at a mid-range telecommunications company almost immediately after graduation. I lived with my parents for the time being so I could save up enough money to buy my own house. After I had about $125,000 I felt that it was time to go ahead and start looking for houses. While I was searching, I came across this TV. I had to make a decision, Buy a moderately priced house that I can live in, build income by renting out extra rooms, and raise a family in one day down the road, or buy this TV. I have to say I made the right choice. I allow people to rent my TV for about $1,000 a week and it's shaping up to be more profitable than my piece of s*** job. When I watch this TV I feel as though I'm immersed in another world. The experience of watching this TV is so amazing, life has become dull compared to the vivid experience of watching this TV. I've since quit my job so I can tend to my TV full time. When I loan it out to to someone, I always find myself lost, directionless, and depressed.

I walked into my kitchen, made a typical $14,000 cup of coffee, cracked open an egg from my golden-egg laying hen, and sat down to watch tv. I looked at the pathetic excuse of a television sitting there in front of me, and thought, ""I deserve better."" Luckily I hopped on amazon and saw this beauty. I knew what i had to do.

I've been told there are people you can hire to do these things...\n\n***update four*** I don't speak Spanish. Julio was very nice but the language barrier was just too much. I asked to watch Nova five times and he just stood there...\n\n***update five*** I have bought the remote.

One for my yacht, one for the living room, one for the other living room, and one for the stable. The quality is okay that is for people. The thoroughbreds out in the stable seem to like it even more. They watch the Kentucky derby and think they are actually racing!! All in all it gets the job done.;Had to have it
464;424.0;5.0;6.0;After calling Jesus down and trading my opportunity to go to heaven, I got only half the money to buy the TV. So I had to capture Jesus and sell him into the human trafficking business to receive the rest of the money needed to harvest the power of heaven and buy this TV.

469;426.0;5.0;6.0;I had the very difficult choice between this beautiful piece of technology or a brand new Audi R8. and i am very happy that i bought this instead, now i can play grand theft auto 5 and just drive the R8, i get the best of both worlds. My kids are currently at the drive through window, making sure that i get my big mac with only cheese... but when they get home (the box this was in) im sure they will know that going to college was not as important as being able to watch me play GTA V on a movie sized screen.;UNREAL

120;429.0;4.0;5.0;My roommate and I are sharing a studio room at the moment, we needed a divider wall to separate our beds. The landlord declined our request to build a wall even by a federal approved contractor. Then we saw this TV, we measured the room and it's size is perfect, so we bought it. The only reason we gave it 4 stars is that the TV's screen is not flat like all high-end TVs do, it's bented. But considering it's below cost price, it's definitely a steal. Another buyer caution is that it doesn't come with built-in VHS or DVD player, just a barebone TV set. Might not be the best choice for media consumption. It's power supply system is not compatible with the cigarette power outlet in my luxury Volkswagen 4th gen Golf 1.6L.;Perfect room divider, great value though it's bented (be aware not high end flat screen)
142;430.0;5.0;5.0;So when I bought this tv it cost a pretty penny of 199,999. For this price I sold my house, sold my children into slavery, sold my mother, and now live in the huge box provided which was then made into another continent called Eastern America. I have no outlet to put the tv in but its worth looking at a big black screen when I wake up. It also took a few friends selling themselves into slavery and giving me the profit.;So when I bought this tv it cost a pretty penny of 199

155;432.0;1.0;5.0;The TV was curved when I got it, so I tried to steam roll it back to being flat. Apparently that wasn't a good idea. :( I'm currently using it as a shield to protect myself from the ongoing alien invasion and it's working great.\n\n*Update*\n\nI recently had some issues with the flux capacitor and found myself stuck in 1955. Luckily, I ran into Doc and we found out that all we needed was a lightening strike to get things going. So, I'm back in 2015 and enjoying this TV. It's not as big as what I'm used to, but we all have budgets.;Curved?
158;433.0;5.0;5.0;This is absolutely amazing. I plugged my ps4 into it and it works just fine with next gen graphics. Now I know that the other reviews complain about the price, but I got it for free. All that I had to do was sell my firstborn child into slavery, and gee wiz was it worth the price.;Best. Investment.

220;444.0;5.0;5.0;What I didn't see when I bought this TV was that it required 2 AA batteries.  Imagine to my surprise when I realized this TV came with no plug and the price was due to Samsung inventing a device that amplifies the output of 2 AA batteries to power a 105inch 4k tv for LIFE.\n\nKudos to Samsung for not using this TV for anything useful and instead using it to power a TV.;A truly revolutionary product!
224;445.0;5.0;5.0;I threw caution to the wind and decided why not!  After we sold our  two children into slavery and signed the deal with Samsung in blood, our lives are amazing!

Thanks Samsung!;What A Deal! !
226;446.0;4.0;5.0;This tv awed me! The price and functionality made this baby a no-brainer for me. The only downside was that I didn't realise it was so big, the wall bracket won't fit on my wall.

251;451.0;4.0;5.0;Pretty good resolution. I bought this TV after a visit to my friend Bill Gates - he had one in the guest bathroom. I suffer serious constipation and watching this TV in Bill's guest bathroom made me forget all about it and I honestly felt really good afterwards. The image is stunning as you would expect from a 4K Ultra HD. My only complaint is that the 3D glasses felt cheap as it's made of plastic compared to my other 3D glasses which are made of 24k pure Gold. Good buy.;Great resolution!!!

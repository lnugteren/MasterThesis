248;1.0;4.0;3982.0;I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.\n\nFirst the good sides:\n\nThis thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.\n\nThe not so good sides:\n\nAs has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.\n\nAs a laptop replacement:\n\nThe inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.\n\nBattery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.\n\nAll in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.\n\nOne final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!\n\nIn conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.;A leap in the right direction
214;2.0;3.0;2842.0;"Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.\n\nFor those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:\n\nMust-Have iPad Accessories:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie=UTF8\n\niPad vs. Other Tablets:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie=UTF8\n\n===== Background and Initial Reaction =====\n\nI'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.\n\nWhen announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.\n\nNeither is it a ""Kindle killer"" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).\n\n===== First Impression =====\n\nTaking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term ""baby"" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.\n\nRight away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.\n\nSmudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an ""oleophobic"" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.\n\nOne of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1"" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13"" or 15"" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.\n\nWhile on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.\n\nEither way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring ""folders"" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.\n\n===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====\n\nWhen Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a ""netbook killer"" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.\n\nDespite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or ""Kindle killer"" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app ""iBooks"" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite ""iWork"" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.\n\nHaving not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!\n\nOn the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.\n\nAlso note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.\n\n===== Interaction Experience =====\n\nThe iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term ""multi-touch"". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.\n\nBeing touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.\n\nTyping Method #1:\nThe most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.\n\nThis typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).\n\nTyping Method #2:\nI've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.\n\nI found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.\n\nAlso, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.\n\nOther methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.\n\n===== Web Browsing =====\n\nAlongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.\n\nIn general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.\n\nHowever, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.\n\n===== Email =====\nEmail on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).\n\nYou can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.\n\nOverall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.\n\nImportant Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.\n\n===== Media =====\n\nIf you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.\n\nThe Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.\n\n===== Photos =====\n\nTwo words: No camera!\n\nBut thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.\n\nOf course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called ""Camera A"" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the ""Camera B"" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.\n\n===== E-Reading =====\n\nWhether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.\n\nMy experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).\n\nAs far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!\n\nAll physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.\n\n===== Gaming =====\n\nIf you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time to\n\nWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.\n\nI see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.\n\n===== Productivity =====\n\nProductivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its ""getting something done"" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called ""iWork"", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.\n\nHowever, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled ""productivity"" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).\n\n===== Printing =====\n\nNotice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.\n\n===== Security =====\n\nWith portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.\n\n===== The Bottom Line =====\n\nDespite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.\n\nIt may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of ""apps for that"". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.\n\nI hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)";Not without flaws, but certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch!
176;3.0;4.0;1398.0;"The main difference between this item, and the wi-fi only version, is of course the sim card with 3G.  So, before I talk about the iPad in general, I'd like to explain my take on the 3G.\n\n3G Performance:\nThe BOTTOM LINE:  Works good as long as you aren't using it in a moving car.  I ran an internet speed test on it and in the metro area it was 1.2Mbps down and 210kbps up, which is decent.\nThe DETAILS: If you are doing basic computing, you will be able to be anywhere within a 3G service area to enjoy the internet.  (If 3g service sucks in your area, don't buy an iPad 3g)  Here is the only problem: when you pass from tower to tower the signal can hang as the data has to be rerouted to the new tower.  Lets put this another way.  If you are using the iPad netflix app to stream ""Kim Possible season 3"" videos to your iPad while driving at 60 MPH it will ""hang"" during the 22 minute show.  In summary: The AT&T 3G works the same as my 3G expresscard from Verizon.\n\n2G Performance: Yes, you can use your iPad on AT&T's 2G EDGE network as needed.  The data is slow.  You won't enjoy it.\n\n3G setup:\n3G setup is simple:\n- press settings button, choose cellular data, press set up cellular service.\n- put in your *iTunes* password.  (AT&T is ""invisible"" except for a logo.)\n- put your credit card into the iPad\n- voila! you have service for 30 days\nIts very slick and takes less than a minute.  Its how it should be.\n\nAvoiding the 3G data charges:  If you are an iPhone user, and you have an iPad, you can avoid paying for 2 data plans by swapping sim cards.  Of course, you might miss a few calls while your sim is in the iPad because the iPad doesn't support phone calls.  If you have an older iphone: Older iPhones use large SIM cards and the ipad uses small microSIM cards.  You would have to cut your large sim card down to the microsim size, and put it in your iPad (you will need a needle to pop it out).  You would need to buy a little adapter (sold on the internet) to make your small sim fit back into your iPhone (so, buy the adapter first!)  But this isn't a great long term solution, because, if you want to use the iPad as a GPS in the car you will not be able to use your phone quickly or easily until you switch them back out again.  Here it is on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsim-Adapter-for-Ipad-Iphone4g-Convert-Micro-Sim-to-Regular-Sim-Adapter/dp/B003XCCYV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsim Adapter for Ipad Iphone4g Convert Micro Sim to Regular Sim Adapter</a>\n\nDO YOU WANT THE 3G INTERNET?\nDespite my little princess being vexed at Kim Possible hanging, the answer is yes.  Certainly, its wonderful to have the 3G access.  Everything about the iPad works better because its a bigger screen, and being able to access the internet (almost) anywhere is very, very useful for me.\n\nNow, the question begs to be asked:  why the ipad at all?\nI have to say I originally joined the legion of pundits who said ""hey, its just a big ipod touch"" and ""it won't replace my laptop"".  Certainly, this has to be the two most common things you hear people say about the ipad, right?  And yes, that can be the truth you choose.\n\niPad vs. Laptop: If your idea is to buy an iPad to replace your laptop, and get an external keyboard, and a docking station, and bla bla bla... then you will be disappointed.  This is a different kind of device, and you can't put a square peg in a round hole.  The iPad is for even more mobile computing than a laptop can provide.  ***A laptop needs a desk.  But the iPad doesn't.***  Thats the point, and if its not compelling for you, then consider carefully before buying an iPad.\n\niPad vs. iPod Touch:  To say its just a big iPod touch is not really fair.  The processor is much more powerful, allowing you to do a LOT MORE.  You also get a big screen.  And the 3g with this version.  So to refuse to upgrade from the ipod Touch is similar to refusing to upgrade from a Kia Rio on the grounds that all other cars do the same thing.\n\nBut the biggest reason the iPad+3G will work for you, is that after a few weeks with it, you will want learn how to make it work for you.  You will *enjoy* using it and it will be easier to use.  You will say ""how can I change what I do so I can do it on the iPad"" not ""how can the iPad do exactly what I did before"".\n\nFor an example: here is a day with the iPad.\nI get up in the morning, and if I'm not being lazy, I get on the treadmill.  I prop the ipad up on the treadmill while I walk.  I watch some news video on the iPad, read some email, play a game, catch up on facebook.  I'm usually not done with this after my walk, so I head downstairs.  Its like carrying a magazine, its so easy.  I bump into my daughter in the hall and show her a picture from her Grandmother, with the iPad securely held in only one hand.  While I'm eating breakfast, and shaving, and brushing my teeth, I'm catching up on a book I was reading on my wife's Kindle: using the kindle ipad app.  Then I can use the iPad when I leave the house, in a myriad of ways that I would not use my iPod Touch or Laptop.  And the iPad fits in the pocket in my car door.  Its really never in the way!\n\nSo far I have used the iPad to:\n1) Watch streaming netflix movies.\n2) Read books on iBooks and Kindle for iPad, both to myself and to my children.\n3) Browse the internet without constantly having to use finger motions similar to ""pinch"" and ""peace"" (goodbye iPhone!).\n4) My kids use it as an interactive coloring book at restaraunts.\n5) I can control my laptop when I am away from home if something crucial comes up, as if I'm sitting at my laptop.\n6) Move pictures from my digital camera to the iPad very quickly and easily (using the camera adapter, sold separately).  Either for storage or for emailing.\n7) Listen to Pandora internet radio anywhere in the house. (ok, I can't really listen to ""Crystal Method thump thump boom boom music"" but most other music sounds good)\n8) I have used the internet to teach my children things when we are away from the house (Daddy, where does the word ""helicopter"" come from?)\n9) Watched owned or rented iTunes movies on my 42 inch LCD TV (using an adapter sold separately).\n\nThe point of the above is that the iPad gives me more FREEDOM when computing, due to its small footprint and light weight.\n\nWhat you can't do on an iPad:\n1) Multitask.  You don't really need all those windows open, but, we're all used to that.\n2) Print.\n3) Use the iPad to connect to a TV and give a presentation.  When you use the HDTV adapter, the iPad screen blacks out so you can only use this for movies.\n4) See macromedia Flash based content online.  (a lot of websites use this, like Hulu)\n\nSteve Jobs says 1 and 2 are coming, in fact, multitasking is on the new iPhone4 so it won't be long.\n#4 will probably never come.  If you need to use Flash websites, then, stick with our laptop.  End of story.\n\nOh and the battery....  The battery is consistently lasting all day, 12 hours, without a recharge.  But, its important to note that MANY USB ports will not charge an iPad.  None of mine will.  Also, my cheap iPhone car charger will not charge my iPad.  There has been discussion about this lately, apparently the charger or USB port has to actually provide the correct rated power.  Most don't provide enough power.  But the battery lasts all day for me so this is not a negative.\n\nIf the reasons above don't help you make up your mind, consider Steve Wozniak's recent comments about the iPad:  ""Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing.""  No viruses.  No compatibity issues.  No wondering why your iPad is so slow (Apple vets all software to make sure this doesn't happen).  No questionable upgrades.  No cryptic errors.  All these things were things that took the joy out of computing for a lot of people.\n\nThe iPad is such a simple thing.  And thats why the average person will love it and prefer to use it instead of a computer.\n\nI'll upgrade this to 5 stars if/when:\n1) More powerful iPad apps come out\n2) Multitasking 2 things at once is possible (at least web browser and word processing, or pandora internet radio app + any other app would be nice)\n3) Some kind of printing would be cool, although, I'm ok with paperless, really...\n\nThere you have it.";Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing.
180;4.0;5.0;887.0;"Want the long and the short of it without having to read a ""mega review""? Here goes. I have an original Kindle and a DX and I've had an iPad for one week. I love them all, but the iPad has won me over. Here's what I've experienced so far:\n\nVERSATILITY - Apps, movies, music, pictures, effective internet connectivity, color display, extremely intuitive GUI all combine to make iPad the hands down winner in this category.\n\nDISPLAY - E Ink is much better for reading, especially in bright light. And, the matte screen on the Kindle doesn't smudge as easily as the iPad screen. However, the iPad has a gorgeous color display and once you get accustomed to it, reading is not difficult. I especially like the backlit display at night when reading in bed ... I can read to my hearts content and not bother my sleeping wife. Slip on the headphones and my full iTunes library is available while I read. If you want a device only to read books, the Kindle wins. If you want color and a display that shows book diagrams and pictures clearly, the iPad wins.\n\nPAGE INTERFACE - I actually like turning pages on the Kindle much better than I do on the iPad. While the iPad has a cool page turning visual (it looks like the page is actually turning), the touch screen is far too sensitive and there is very little edge around the screen to hold on to. The result is that I'm constantly turning pages on the iPad when i don't want to. Kindle's buttons win this one hands down.\n\nCONVENIENCE - on the iPad, all my media is in one place (audio books, photos, music, books, internet, breaking news/weather, address book, email ... the list goes on.) The Kindle, while and excellent book reading device, still requires me to bring along an iPod or a laptop when I travel. iPad is the clear winner.\n\nPRICE - Kindle and the iPad simply aren't that far apart. If a hundred bucks is going to break the budget, stick with the Kindle because it is an excellent reader. If you can afford a little more, go with the iPad... it just is much more versatile. If the Kindle DX were a couple of hundred bucks less, it would be a great reading bargain.\n\nAVAILABLE BOOKS - hands down, Amazon slaughters Apple in just sheer volume of available titles. However, Apple's titles often include color pictures, diagrams, etc. that can actually be sized by the reader for easier viewing. Downside here is that Apple's titles are often higher priced. Winner here is Amazon/Kindle. However, there is an App available for the iPad that allows you to read Amazon Kindle media. It is still not a very elegant design, but it does allow you to read these titles easily and I'm sure the App will only improve with time.\n\nSEX APPEAL - ok, when the Kindle was first introduced, it was a hot item. I couldn't read it at the airport without being interrupted at least a few times by people asking what it was and waning to look at it. Same thing with the iPad, only it's exponentially hotter. With it's sleek design, excellent color display and tons of Apps, people just go nuts asking questions. In short, it just generates a lot of interest and this is proven by the fact that Apple has already sold over a million of these things during the first month of availability. This thing is addictive ... with the Kindle, I can read a book. With the iPad, I can do almost everything I could before on my laptop AND I can read a book.\n\nMY OPINION ONLY - sorry Amazon. You have a great product that pioneered the whole ebook market (others came before you, but you made it work.) Your Kindle is an excellent product, but given the iPad, your device is very much overpriced. Your library continues to be the standard by which all others are judged and I will continue to buy e-books from you, but I'll be reading them on an iPad. On that rare occasion where I'll be laying on a beach reading in direct sunlight, I'll pull out my Kindle because you have an edge there.\n\nI hope whoever reads this finds it useful. I the end, it's your money and your preference so my opinion really doesn't matter. I hope you enjoy whichever device you settle on.";Comparison Between Kindle and Apple iPad
223;5.0;1.0;611.0;"I was very disappointed when I finally got my hands on this ipod touch with a big screen, a ""magical device"". Simply put there is nothing magical about it. I have been using a windows-based tablet since 2003, and it has more advanced technology and capability than apple's 2010 Ipad. The biggest paradox is that despite people calling this the apple ipad tablet, it's not a tablet at all, you can't take hand-written notes on it. The one thing that would have been able to define a new category of device would have simply been that. Furthermore there is:\n\nno camera,\nno usb ports,\nno easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy,\nno easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office),\nthe on-screen keyboard is not practical,\nthe screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars,\nthere is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD,\nno card readers for your photos,\nno flash support for websites (rendering 50% of the web useless),\nthere are wifi issues (connections dropped),\nthe screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors,\nno multitasking support\nridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)\nit's very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)\nit will set you back $600 (the price of a full-featured laptop)\n\nI could go on for a while but I'll just stop here. What is frustrating is that Apple obviously has the technology to include these things easily, so it was purely a short-term business decision on their end. For the moment, they are blatantly exploiting certain consumers' willingness-to-pay for the ipad. They are taking advantage of their brand recognition and marketing power to extract revenues from a purposely made sub-par product. The only way to stop this type of behavior is to either stop buying bad products (sounds easy but people aren't always rational), or wait until competition kicks in over the next six months. I hope this business plan doesn't come back to bite them in the end, in my opinion they are definitely playing with fire on this one.\n\nOn the plus side because of these omissions, it's simple (a grandma could use it), it's fast (but this is because it doesn't run a real operating system) it has ok battery (9 hours) and it's thin (although not light, you will get tired of holding it after 5 minutes).\n\nIn one sentence: You're paying $600-1000 for a semi-portable web-browser which gives you access to about 30% of the web.\n\nHope that helps you make up your own mind, I returned mine after 48 hours.";Apple taking advantage of certain consumers

240;8.0;5.0;274.0;"Just to set the stage correctly - I'm a multiple Microsoft MVP winner for the tablet PC platform.  I've been using tablets since their inception in the early 2000's and have used Windows since 1988.  I've been programming since 1981.  My level of knowledge is way, way up there.  And until last July, I never even considered a Mac product.  Everything I needed to do was available on Windows, most of the critical apps of mine weren't even available for the Mac OS.\n\nLast spring I purchased another car, and I've long had MP3 players, but never an Ipod.  This new car had direct plug access to the Ipods, and allowed all the metadata to display on the radio head unit, as well as full control via the steering wheel controls.  So I got an Ipod, my first Apple device.  For the heck of it I threw the little Apple sticker on my back window and watched everyone who knew me, employees and clients alike (I'm the director of an IT consulting firm), freak out when they saw the apple on my car.\n\nThen last July a friend of mine showed me his new Macbook pro, and what got me was the hardware, NOT the software.  The touchpad was just magical, and after trying it, there was no other input method to compare, and all the windows machines had nothing that felt like this glass surfaced beauty.  The backlit keyboard, the solid body (My last two Lenovo's had cracks in their shells just from grabbing one side and picking them up), the design of the hardware was just light years past anything ever done on a PC.  And with the new ones running on the intel processor, and able to directly run windows, not just virtually, it made sense for me to get one.  So I did.\n\nThen last November I replaced my 1 year old Media center PC with a new Dell Zino, and a month after that replaced THAT with a new Mac Mini.  So in about 5 months, I went from a Mac hater to someone who had an ipod, a macbook pro, and a Mac Mini.\n\nSo when the iPad was announced, people weren't sure where I'd fall.  I was a longtime Mac hater, now a convert, but this ""first ever tablet device"" was hardly that, Microsoft has been doing tablets for a long time.  And my initial take was very, very negative.  Like most of the talking heads out there who didn't like it, I was wondering what possible use something that wasn't a real OS would be, something that can't multitask, and, for my tablet background, why on earth there's no support for pens.  For me, the best thing about tablets and slates has always been notetaking.  I loved MS Journal, and Onenote.  Not for *converting* the handwriting to text, but for persisting my notes IN handwriting.  I liked it.  Worked great.  And the form factor on this device would have been outstanding for such activity.\n\nBut no joy, we all know how Jobs hates pens.  Don't know why, he thinks it's an ""outdated"" method of input or some such, yet he puts keyboards on everything, which, according to his type of thinking, should also by now be an outdated type of input...\n\nSo I had no plans on getting one.  I have been waiting for more info on the HP Slate, which would run Windows 7, have multitasking ability, all the things I was used to on a slate.\n\nBut I kept thinking about the battery life.  And the form factor.  I use a kindle daily, and this would be a great replacement for it since, while I liked the concept, both versions of the device I've had just still didn't do it for me.  My eyes don't get strained from conventional monitors and displays so it didn't benefit me at all to have the paper ink, but it WOULD benefit me to have a backlit device again for night time reading.  And since the iBook app supposedly would allow me to open other books I already had (I've been doing ebooks for years and years before the kindle was ever announced, reading them on my windows PDA phones and comptuers), there was potential here.\n\nBut I kept going to the single use, non comptuer OS, limitations.\n\nBut I also start to twitch when there's a new toy available.  So I started thinking about what I do with computers, both for work and at home, and realized that I didn't *NEED* a full windows 7 slate device with multitasking and everything, since I did not want a second ""main"" computer.  I keep EVERYTHING for both work and my entire personal life on my laptop, so getting the HP would then necessitate a lot of syncing of data between both the windows side of my macbook as well as the mac side.  Something I don't like dealing with.\n\nSo I realized I didn't want a full computer.  I didn't need the ipad to replace anything, or take over any existing functionality of my computers.  I wanted it to take over my kindle, and maybe give me some fun drawing apps to play with my 6 year old in.  So I decided to give it a try.\n\nSo two days ago I ran to the local brick and mortar, figuring they'd be sold out, but at least I could play with a demo unit and see what it was like, get myself past my preconceptions and all the BS flying on the blogosphere.  I picked one up, held it, and two store associates were playing with the one next to me.  I asked them how quickly they sold out - they told me they didn't, that Apple did a great job stocking them, and they had all versions still left.  I decided to not even play with the demo, but just take one home.  So I grabbed the 16GB version (knowing I didn't need it for an ipod and such, so 16GB would be sufficient) and went home.\n\nUnboxed quickly since there's nothing but the unit, USB cable, and power adapter.  Came fully charged, so I was up and running instantly.  Within about 15 minutes I had 70 free apps installed already and was moving through things like a pro.  And it dawned on me that even if i wanted that HP Windows 7 based slate, it would NEVER be this smooth.  That is one place where Apple just dominates - the UI.  And this one was great.  Everything worked intuitively, the apps were well designed, and I found my conversions of some of my ebooks to EPUB format installed just fine in Itunes, and showed up just beautifully in iBook.  So the reading experience became way better instantly than the kindle could be.  And with the kindle software available, I can already get the books I purchased there as well, so i had the best of both worlds.\n\nThe drawing apps were a big hit for my 6 year old, who, like any kid, loves finger painting.\n\nWeather apps abound, my favorite so far is weatherbug (not a shock, theirs was my favorite gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well).  I've had storms here, heavy, severe, over the last few days, and my usual thing when dealing with storms at night, while I'm laying in bed reading my kindle, is to randomly get up, go into the great room, and check out the local weather satellites from a few local news stations, see what is still heading this way, how heavy, etc, maybe check mail again while I'm there, then go back and read some more, repeat a few times over an hour or two.  So this time, I just changed form iBook to Weatherbug, saw instantly the local radar, what was still on the way, then hopped into the browser, checked all my mail accounts (the built in Microsoft Exchange support is seamless and works great BTW), and enjoyed the browser, which works and looks just as well as my Safari does on the macbook pro.  So without having to leave my toasty bed, I was reading, checked three weather sites, three mail accounts, and was back reading, all flawlessly, no running around my house.\n\nThe last part I tried finally last night was instant message, which for me is critical since all my employees use it to keep in touch with me, as do a couple friends.  With the push technology, all the ""you can't do this and that at once"" fell apart for me and was debunked.  I already had noted that my ipad, regardless of what I was doing or what app I had open, chimed i had a new mail on my works' exchange server before even my smart phone, or my computer directly connected to my exchange server.  And so went my experience with IM as well.  I loaded a client I've used in windows, then closed the IM program and opened iBook, and a buddy of mine sent me a message.  I got not just the notification, but a bubble with his text actually opened in front of ibook, and had a choice of switching over to reply or just close the text bubble and keep reading.  So that really rid me of all concerns about the lack of multitasking since that gives me exactly what I need - notification of an email or an IM while I'm doing something else.  This is all the computing power I needed on this.\n\nSo I finally realized I didn't WANT another tablet PC, another full fledged computer.  I wanted something to fill a need between my phone's screen and my computer.  Something to replace my kindle, something for some neat games, playing and painting with my 6 year old, and simple/convenient IM and mail access when i'm just vegging at home and don't always want to pull my laptop on my lap to check something quick.\n\nThe keyboard is actually far easier and better to use than I had expected, and much faster to type on than I hoped.  Not as nice, obviously, as a full screen one, but works surprisingly well.\n\nScreen is a delight - even hours of reading later it's still comfortable, bright, but it gets fingerprints easily despite some ""non fingerprint coating"" they tried to use to minimize it.  Still looks awful after a while at an angle when you look at it askew.  But not at all noticeable while staring at it straight and using it.\n\nScreen brightness is good, but it doesn't go down as far as I would've liked for ebook reading, but then I found iBook has a separate brightness control that lets me dim it to nearly nothing for use in the dark.  Outstanding.\n\nSo then I started throwing some music and photos on it, and that's when I realized I can easily use this to show my grandmother pictures of her great grandson, since she's in her upper 80's and refuses to have a computer, so we can't email her or send her links or anything.  So I started playing with music and photos, and this thing became such a cool toy at that point.  I had to run back to the store and return it so I could buy the larger 32GB model since I knew by this time I was keeping it.  Fortunately I have a 45 day return period with no restocking fees at this place, so the upgrade was painless and free of cost.\n\nThat's when I found out that itunes was automatically backing up my unit when it synced.  So when I plugged the new one in, the first thing it said was ""restore?""  So i tried it.  It restored all my settings, including mail, so all I had to do was reenter passwords the first time, and I was back up and running after it resynced my apps again.  Those stayed in Itunes so I didn't have to redownload everything.\n\nPlaying with pictures is pretty fun and very smooth, and the speaker on this thing is surprisingly full of bass.  There's even an equalizer for tweaking the sound output to your liking.  And the music keeps playing after you close the app so you can have the tunes playing while doing other things (but it will stop when you hit something else that takes over multimedia like a video or some other sound thing from an email of course).\n\nI grabbed the apple book-like cover and the dock, but you can't charge it in the dock while that cover is on.\n\nSo I went from the initial ""What a useless piece of junk"" detractor to the ""I wouldn't live without it"" supporter.\n\nI gave them all sorts of grief for using the term ""magical"" to describe it, but I have to say, that it actually felt nearly magical that first hour doing things...  All my experience with the tablet PC and I wasn't ready to experience what this interface was like.\n\nAnd with this, i may finally be able to get my grandma to have something to keep at her condo so we can email her pictures and such...  This would make it a lot easier for her than trying to get her to use a full computer...\n\nSo for a first revision, it's a grand slam out of the park hit.  Granted, it's just a big ipod touch or iphone or whatever, but for someone who never used either of those, and wanted something with a useful form factor, this is a BIG hit.";Hated it until I bought one
242;9.0;1.0;238.0;"I jumped on the iPad craze and purchased a 32GB on launch date- I was excited about this device as a way to read books online and to surf the net.  It is a nice looking device and it is very fast.  Unfortunately, I experienced constant dropped WiFi connectivity as I moved throughout the house.  I do not have this problem with other wireless devices and the signal is always strong/excellent.  When the iPad was sitting right next to the router, the internet was much improved but obviously I did not buy a mobile device to be tethered to a stationary router.  I tried all the tricks suggested (rebooting settings, etc) and nothing seemed to help in my situation.  I have a Verizon Actiontec router in the house.\n\nApparently this is not a new issue for Apple wireless devices if you look at the Apple support discussion boards. The iPod also has these issues. Apparently many others are having similar problems with WiFi and iPad.  You would think Apple would work out the bugs before releasing the iPad.\n\nI am going to wait a few generations for Apple to get the bugs out.  This is too much money to spend on this kind of ""toy"" and then to struggle with the internet connection.  I cannot recommend the iPad based on my 5 day experience with it.  This was my very first Apple purchase- too bad Apple wasted this opportunity to lure this PC user to the Apple brand.";I returned the iPad to Apple store today
117;10.0;1.0;215.0;When the iPad 3G became available it seemed to be an ideal solution for us to use when traveling away from our home in northern New Mexico.  We knew that ATT 3G service was not available in our immediate area, but that was not important because we planned to use the iPad either with the WIFI in our home and or when we were traveling to a place with 3G. Because we could get a data plan on a monthly basis without a long-term commitment it seemed workable.\n\nUnfortunately, when we tried to sign up for ATT service before a trip to CA, we found a glitch in both the ATT and Apple plan.  iPad software will not allow users in an area without 3G to sign up, as determined by the billing ZIP code.\n\nWhen we called ATT and asked how to get around this problem, we were told that the only way was to apply for a credit card with a ZIP code in an area with service.  When I suggested that was a nutty suggestion, the ATT representative told me that the problem was really Apple's and gave me their contact number.\n\nApple, of course, immediately told me that I should contact ATT as this was their problem.  When the Apple representative learned that ATT had no reasonable solution, Apple admitted that I was out of luck for using the iPad in the way we wanted.  It is impossible to believe that neither Apple nor ATT had encountered this problem, but ATT service really seems unavailable.\n\nAs a result, iPad 3G buyers in areas without 3G coverage in their billing ZIP code end up with a larger, and much more expensive, but fancy version of an iPod.;No ATT Service anywhere if your billing ZIP doesn't have 3G
195;11.0;1.0;180.0;The IPad constantly drops my WiFi connection, both at home at at work, that works just fine with three Windows 7 laptops and one Macbook. It happens every 5-10 minutes. It keeps asking for the password, often 3-4 times in a rom. My Iphone has the problem sometimes (once a week or so).\nIts basically unusable at this point. An internet search revealed that many users have the same issue.;WiFi abysmal

194;13.0;1.0;153.0;OK, I've had my iPad for almost a month.  I continue to suffer repeated WiFi problems.  It's not my router, it works fine with my iMac and my iPod.  It's time for Apple to admit there is a problem and get a software fix for this thing.  It becomes useless to you since you won't be able to maintain a connection with the internet.\n\nWAIT TO BUY THIS UNTIL APPLE ADMITS AND FIXES THE PROBLEM!!!\n\nOther than that, it is very nice, but it really needs to work.;WiFi Sucks, Do Not Buy until Apple fixes
123;14.0;1.0;117.0;Horrible wifi brought 16gb non-3g and 32g with 3g and both have horrible wifi. I know that apple has a history of not working well with non apple wifi routers, but this is ridiculous. It prompts me every other hour for a wifi password. If you experience the same problem the quickest work-around is to NOT re-enter your password, but to cancel and then go to settings and switch the wifi off and then back on. I would not recommend purchasing the ipad until they put out a service pack to fix this issue. I am beginning to sound like I am taking about microsoft.\n\nHad to reduce to 1 star. The wifi is bad same thing happening to friends. Obvious software problem when ipad repeatedly prompts for wifi password when it already has the password stored in settings.;weak wifi
249;15.0;5.0;116.0;"I've had an iPad since the first day they were available. It's taken it's place in the household as the preferred way to browse the web, watch bedtime videos with the kids, and play games. Just yesterday, my four year old son sat around the device with his friend playing Plants vs. Zombies HD and it was as easy, natural and comfortable as if they were playing tic tac toe instead of an elaborate tower defense game. It would not have been possible for two four year olds to share a game like that with the mechanics of mousing in the way on a desktop computer or on the cramped screen of an iPhone.\n\n[Update: iPad Camera Connection Kit: I received my iPad Camera Connection Kit recently and that works well, quickly and slickly. It comes as two parts: an SD reader module and a USB port module. The idea being that you can either take the SD card out of your camera or you can connect the camera directly depending on the module. Pop it together and photos and movies are imported into the Camera Roll, and are viewable if the iPad can handle the format, so JPEG images off the SD card from my Lumix can be displayed, as can RAW images imported over USB from my Nikon D-3000. All RAW formats are not viewable, but they should be transferable. I was not able to use a 3rd party SD reader with the USB port as it ""used too much power."" The USB connector also allows a 3rd party audio device, so you can get digital optical stereo (not surround) out of your iPad instead of the normal dock connectors analog line out. Mass storage devices are apparently not supported.]\n\nIn my opinion, the iPad delivers an unmatched content delivery capability. The browsing experience alone is worth the price of admission, but it does so many other activities so well and with such beauty and an organic interaction between user and content that just scratches the surface of what can be done.\n\nThis is not a general purpose computer. I am not going to write much source code on it or transcode video or those other activities my laptop and desktop computers do so well. And while text entry is markedly better than on an iPhone, I would not look forward to writing anything longer than this review on its keyboard, although with each sentence of experience I achieve that gets less true. No, what this is is a viewing computer without peer.\n\nYou have not browsed the web until you do it with the firm swipes of mobile Safari. I know people have fixated on the lack of Flash and Flash advertising, games and video. And maybe for some people that is a big loss. For me, the only loss is the occasional home improvement show on Hulu, and it seems likely there will be an app for that just as there are ones for Netflix, ABC, Youtube, etc, while sites like CBS put some, but not all,  content into DRM free HTML 5 video. What you lose in Flash you more then make up for in the amazing speed of browsing and how natural it all seems.  (Having said this, the first time I asked my wife to try answering her e-mail on the device, the first message was to a Flash greeting card.)\n\nThe speed of the device is amazing for a low power portable device. Maybe it's the Apple custom A4 processor, or maybe it's the limitation of having so few processes, or the optimization of the OS for GPU acceleration, but the iPad is liquid fast at nearly everything.\n\nVideo playback is fast. Photo browsing is fast. Mail is fast. The calendar is fast. Large games like Plants Versus Zombies HD launch in a fraction of the time they do on an iPhone. You get the idea.\n\nThird party developers have stepped up to the plate and delivered both beauty and added functionality. The Kindle app is smooth and imported all my Kindle account books quickly--it's good that there will be competition in the iPad eBook market between Apple's own iBooks store and Amazon't Kindle. The Weather HD app is stunning as it embroiders the mundane delivery of a weather report. Wolfram Alpha is big and well laid out and more powerful than ever.\n\nAs for the hardware, I am really liking this screen. It is bright, colorful and sharp with an amazing viewing angle. It does get a little smudged which is noticeable when watching movies but its oleo-phobic screen cleans with a quick wipe.. Its wide viewing angle is a great improvement on my MacBook's screen which would be unreadably dark at the angle I'm typing this. Some people think the iPad is surprisingly heavy, while someone else was surprised how light it was (the same person also expressed remorse at having bought a Nook after about 8 seconds of playing with my iPad).\n\nBe careful with charging this. It likely won't work with your current iPhone  car charger. My wife's car charger started to burn trying to handle the extra amperage this device demands. Best to only use this with either your computer's USB ports or the charger it came with. And charging time is slow via a computer, from full empty it takes 7 minutes until reboot, and around 40 minutes per 10% charge (so you are looking at over 6 hours for a full charge from fully drained). The wall adapter is about twice as fast. Regardless, be prepared to make over night charging part of your daily routine, although you will get several days of moderate use between charges given the amazing 10+ hours of activity you get from a full charge. A decade of laptop use has not prepared me for how long you can use this to do everything. It seemingly doesn't matter what you are doing, you still get 10 hours. Or more.\n\nIt goes without saying that you do not want to charge this device from your laptop's battery like you might do to your iPhone on a lengthy plane trip.\n\nAs for the decision to buy the 64 GB model, I think it comes down to perceived usage. I plan to fill it with quality feature length movies for when my wife travels to China. At about 1.5GB per movie (720x480 h. 264)--or more if you have 720p content--16GB seemed a little tight while still loading multiple gigabytes of photos and music. 32 GB would probably be sufficient, and it's going to seem insane in a couple years spending so much for 32 GB of flash memory.\n\nIf you get a chance to play with one, try to find a comfy chair where you can put your feet up and make a platform for the device. This will negate the problem of holding its heft and allow you to build up your full speed typing skills. Realize there are all sorts of tricks you will learn and that after an hour you will be a master. Lock the iPad into landscape mode using the hardware toggle switch. I find I never have a need to use portrait mode unless a piece of software makes use of a separate portrait mode. Explore. There are so many little delightful touches to discover like the lock screen photo frame mode, the dictionary in the book reader, tapping on the status bar to go to the top of a web page, etc.\n\nThis is a moving target. Every time Apple releases a new version of the OS or a 3rd party developer gets a bright idea, the device will get better. For instance, Apple has announced iPhone OS 4 which addresses many major complaints people have and adds features we didn't know we needed. This fall, you will be able to keep Pandora and Skype running the background while you are playing a game or browsing the web or whatever; this will make these apps vastly more useable. You will be able to organize your apps in folders. Better organize your e-mail. And look forward to smaller developers coming out with more social network games.\n\nIf I were to point out one misfeature it is how badly the 2x mode for legacy iPhone apps looks. It just seems as though Apple could have put more effort in making non-bitmap GUI elements look sharp instead of just stretching all the pixels. You would think they could at least have made text and the built in keyboard look better.\n\nI don't like the Apple branded optional case, so I would try before buying the case. It just gets in the way making it hard to access the external controls, and should only be necessary in a scratch prone environment. I am thinking about going with a Gelaskin protective skin instead.\n\nIn summary, I am a big fan of this device for a wide variety of activities be it web browsing, game playing, enjoying media, reading email (less so composing email), and reading books. I highly recommend picking one up if you have the means, although I would wait a few weeks until they are back in stock at the normal retail prices or even until the 3G version comes out.";People Who Actually Use iPads Tend to Like Them - A Lot
155;16.0;5.0;106.0;"I have 2 iPads. A 64 GB WiFi only model which I bought the day it was available, and this 32GB 3G model which I picked up last week. They are about the same price; if you have to choose between an extra 32GB of storage and 3G capacity, definitely go with the 3G if for nothing else future proofing. I consider this to be the sweet spot of the 6 iPad variants.\n\nRight now, my wife is in China with a WiFi only model. She is not a technical person, and can rarely find an open WiFi hotspot. So, she goes days between checking her e-mail. E-mail which might be critical to her business. If she had a 3G model, I could have purchased a modestly priced data plan from Chinese Unicom, modified a data SIM to a micro-SIM, and she would be getting her e-mail every minute, and doing some light web browsing.  On the other hand, her iPad is loaded with media with over a dozen DVD quality films, all her music, and a large number of family photos. This does take advantage of the extra storage, but is a poor substitute for the whole Internet.\n\n3G is not quite the great deal as it was yesterday, AT&T is eliminating unlimited data for new accounts. In the past, the deal was you could get unlimited data for $30/month with no contract. Now you can get a $25/month deal for 2GB, which is probably more than enough if you don't watch video.  Existing $30/month users might as well be on contract, because they will have to keep paying to get the original deal.  There are also cheaper smaller plans. Right now I'm on the unlimited plan, and it is great. I have been Skyping to my wife in China, using Google maps, browsing the web in the dentist office and at lunch. It is very slick. I tried the 250 MB/month plan and that was just too small for what I was doing.\n\nAs for the rest of the iPad, it is great. I downloaded a free novel from the iBooks store and read it comfortably without any eyestrain or hurting my arm. It's my preferred device for browsing the web, although you do get to notice the lack of Flash. It's mostly ads though so that's fine, but occasionally there will be a graph or video which you just can't see. Over time, I expect this will be less of a problem as Flash dies out, but it is mildly annoying now.\n\nThe glass does get awfully greasy, but that is easily wiped away. Typing is surprisingly OK, I can type about as fast as I normally can if I concentrate. My kids like watching YouTube every night, and that is slicker than going to the website. So, I find I use the iPad several hours a day, which means I can get 2 or 3 days out of a full battery charging, which is a relief compared to being worried about keeping my iPhone charged.\n\nThis is indeed a game changing device, and I think most anyone will find there are hours of the day whether it be on the couch, bed or passenger's seat where it is nearly the ideal computing companion.";Yes, You Will Want 3G

222;19.0;2.0;85.0;"First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17"" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips. I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc. What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user. I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices. There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for. I purchased a game ""Super Monkey Ball 2"" for iPad and it looks and plays great! I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good. Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me. Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie. Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads ""Safari Cannot open page because the server stopped responding"". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection. Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem. Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release. It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection. It's unpredictable.\n\nNow for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads ""not charging"". I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem. I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users. The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read. It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger. If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.\n\nLIKES:\nI like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection. When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.\n\nThe iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in. The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from. The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.\n\nIt's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol I have also used the internet radio while in the shower. You sit the iPad on the counter and turn it full blast. Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations. If your bathroom has a fan, you won't hear it while showering. I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.\n\nI downloaded the digital copy of the latest ""Batman"" movie and it looked and sounded great!\n\nThough you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.\n\nIt's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17"" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.\n\nI love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off. I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.\n\nThe iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lol\n\nWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed. However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it. Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.\n\nDISLIKES:\nI do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad. You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens. I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.\n\nThe manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual. the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.\n\nThere is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting. You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button. The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change. If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.\n\nEven though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop. Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook. For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.\n\nThe keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are. Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing. Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works. If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing. The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word. For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed ""OMG"" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted ""OMB"". I didn't notice until I left the comment.\n\nThis device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off. It fills the screen with the sheer blue coating that prevents you from doing anything until disable it which I have to exit from the page and return.\n\nMost apps or pages allow you to enlarge the font on the screen or do the finger stretch thing but some don't and if you don't have the greatest vision could be hard to read.  Mostly I find this on the iPhone apps I installed on the iPad.\n\nThe search function on the iBooks app leaves a lot to be desired.  You can only search exact titles or authors. If you want a subject matter like ""gay"", the results will not bring up books on that topic. You have to know the specific name of the book or author.\n\nIt has one speaker so watching movies with the speaker on won't give you stereo but if you plug in headphones, viola! stereo sound.\n\nIn summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer. If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws. If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.";PC users beware!
104;20.0;4.0;82.0;"I got a WiFi, non-3G version, the cheapest one; I don't need GPS and don't want to pay AT&T any more than I absolutely have to, and don't want another monthly subscription, either.  Got plenty of those, it seems.  And, at least for now, I don't need all that storage.\n\nI'm not what one would consider a ""Power User"" of the iPad.  I use a laptop constantly, and bought the iPad a couple of months ago because it is great looking and I was curious about it and I got a case of The Wants.  I've been involved with computers since the mid-60's when I first was employed as an IBM 360 (and 1401 before that) programmer, and I've continued messing with them pretty heavily ever since, though I changed careers in the early 70's.  Over the years, I've owned (in a small business) maybe 40 or 50 desktops and laptops, including several Apple IIe's way back when.  I've always liked Apple products, but not used them due to the overwhelming prominence of DOS and Windows products (both software and hardware) and the excellent pricing of IBM clones.\n\nBut when the iPad came out, I couldn't help myself.  I now pick it up several times a day and use it.  I've taken it on trips without a laptop.  Here's what I think, mostly.\n\nPros:\n1. It's cool.  No avoiding it, the little fella is great looking and has that Apple minimalist approach to design that they do so well.\n2. It's tiny.  Well, small, anyway.  That's good and maybe bad, but it does have its appeal.\n3. Screen resolution seems creamy, silky smooth.  Don't know how they did it, and don't really care.  It's good.\n4. I love Apple's approach to WiFi....  Walking into a new place, without even the slightest thought from  you, the iPad finds an open connection and asks if you want to connect to it.  If you say yes, you never hear from it again.  Done.  If the proper connection needs a WPA code or such, it simply asks for it.  No fuss.  (It seems like Windows, which I use for hours every day and have since it came out, has never really felt comfortable with wireless networking).\n5. No keyboard.  Well, face it, most of the time you don't use one, anyway.  Not having it is OK.  No mouse, either, for that matter.  Good.\n6. Scrolling is a dream.  Fabulous.  Effortless.  Scrolling, something that simple, is probably the single thing this little unit does best.  You have to try it to understand it.\n7. One of my apps (I don't have many) is a flight simulator similar to MS Flight Simulator.... X-Plane.  It allows pilots to practice instrument flying, so I got it.  VERY cool.  No joystick foolishness.  You must rotate the iPad itself like you would a yoke and the airplane turns or climbs or descends, or whatever.  Way easier than Windows products to do the same thing.\n8. Pilot friends who use other apps for charts and such love it, so I would guess that all graphics applications work pretty well on the little system, though I haven't tried.  Oh, yeah, Google Maps and Earth and such look great, too.  Apple always has done graphics well, so no real surprise.\n9. Ditto for video.\n10. Battery life is great.  Days on end at my level of usage.\n11. My Blackberry has a cute feature (maybe everyone has it, now):  When typing an email address or URL, when one presses the space bar, the OS converts it to a @ or a period, whichever is appropriate.  The iPad takes that to another level....  There is a "".com"" key that enters that when pressed.  A small thing, but more helpful than one might think on a device where typing ain't as easy as using an IBM keyboard.\n\nCons:\n1.  It's hard to hold and easy to drop.  Needs a shell or something to protect it; that makes it as big as a netbook or small laptop, anyway.\n2. Can't keep several ""windows"" open at the same time to switch back and forth.  Not a horrible issue, because you can get back to a previous window relatively easily, but sometimes you'd like to have both open at the same time or be able to switch with a single click.  If there's a way to do that I haven't found it.\n3. Hotmail and Gmail don't work like they do on a laptop.  Or on a Blackberry Storm2, for that matter.  I don't know the issue, but I can't seem to find a way to send a new email (though it's easy enough to reply).  I'm sure there is some app or setting to fix it, but I really don't want to be troubled with that.  I just want it to work.  Like the way WiFi does.  (Since I wrote this, I actually went into the email setup and set it up; it works, but I would prefer to use Hotmail and Gmail as pure web based apps rather than something more akin to a cell phone feature, which, of course, it is).\n4. You can't print from it. I've read that there is a wireless printing feature in the next OS.  Waiting to see.\n5. When working with it in your lap, either in a chair or a recliner or bed, a laptop is just more well suited for the job.  The iPad has to be held up, and, the screen is lower, so you are craning your neck more.  I don't use a stand to put it in.  Things like that and the case to put it in detract from the advantage of small size, so you might as well use a small laptop which will make you happier in the long run for this sort of thing.\n6. No keyboard.  And don't tell me they make a keyboard for it.  If I have to buy that, I might as well get a laptop.  Typing on the screen is a trip.  If you use the virtual keyboard holding the iPad in the ""landscape"" position the keyboard is large, and a little awkward to span the keys with your thumb.  So, you end  up turning the iPad up to the ""portrait"" position where the keyboard is better suited to thumb-typing.  I haven't tried typing in the traditional way (""touch typing"")....  I just reach for the laptop.  I'm using my Lenovo to type this review.\n7. OK, here we go....  No Flash.  Now, I don't have a dog in this fight, but I don't understand this.  Every now and then (pretty often, actually) some video will come up and the iPad will tell me that it doesn't do Flash. (Happens frequently on sports and news sites). I never even knew what Flash was before this issue came up.  Well, Apple wants me to go to iTunes to download their app that will let you view Flash files.  OK, y'all, why didn't you just put it in the iPad from the get-go?  I just want it to work.  Yesterday, I wanted to watch a video of a Tropical Storm in the Caribbean, so I clicked on the link to go get Apple's app.  Then I had to cycle through a few pages on iTunes.  Heck with it.  I just used the laptop (which has a larger screen, anyway).  There's a saying: ""People don't want quarter inch drills, they want quarter inch holes. ""\n\nSo, what's the upshot?\n\nI like it.  I'd buy it again.  No, I wouldn't wait for the Android competitors to come out.  Well, I am curious about those and might get one of them, too, just to check it out.  But, the WiFi-only iPad is a nice, polite little computer.\n\nI do want to say this, and it's one of those potentially inflammatory things, but I don't mean it like that....  It's more of a toy than a tool.  If I am really in need getting things done....  Spreadsheets, presentations, documents, etc, it's really hard to beat the tried and true Windows laptops that are available everywhere and are dirt cheap and fit in with the way things are done and the formats that are used throughout the business community.\n\nSo, sure I use it.  This morning (a Sunday) I've been using it....  looking at airplanes for sale (daydreaming) and checking out a few football forums and generally surfing the web.  So, if this review seems a bit too negative, that's not really intended.  I like it.\n\nThat said, a would-be buyer needs to understand what it is that he is getting, and what that is, is something of a media machine that requires you conform to Apple's way of doing things, a very good little web surfboard and a pretty neat little toy.";It's a bit of a toy.
230;21.0;4.0;68.0;"Here's an update to my original review.  I bought the iPad on April 3rd (first day it was available).  Best gadget purchase I've ever made.  The iPad is my first Apple purchase. Prior to the iPad, I didn't feel that Apple's products were worth the money.  With the iPad however, not only did Apple make a great product, but they priced it quite competitively. I'll list below first what I love about the iPad, then where I feel the iPad falls a bit short.\n\nHere's what I really like about the iPad:\n\n 1.  Instant on capability to the Internet.\n  With the iPad you don't have to wait long for it to boot up.  When the iPad is completely off, it takes\n  about 15 seconds to start the device.  There is also a ""standby off"" which uses virtually no power and\n  allows ""instant on"" capability.\n\n  2. Superb web browsing experience.\n  The iPad comes with Safari, an excellent web browser.  I'm especially impressed with the way I can zoom\n  in on a page at any size.  (Text size is completely variably-sized, allowing you to fit web pages and text\n  perfectly with the screen.)  Pages render very quickly (faster than on my many PCs) with no problems.\n  True, there is no support for Flash but I've found that to be a very minimal ""hardship"" as the iPad has\n  other free apps (like YouTube) that compensates for lack of Flash.\n\n  4. Bright, easily readable and navigable screen\n  Though not perfect: (I wish it were not glossy), the iPad screen is excellent.  It's 9.7"" size seems\n  just right and the multi-touch interface works flawlessly.  The way I can intuitively scroll down on\n  a page makes web browsing and other document reading a real pleasure.  Font support is not extensive but\n  what fonts are available render beautifully.  The iPad can be read easily indoors or outdoors provided\n  you are not in direct sunlight.\n\n  5. Decent speaker sound and wonderful headphone sound.\n  The iPad can generate reasonably loud (if not high quality) sound from its built-in speakers.  Of course\n  it sounds wonderfully if using headphones and/or you choose to feed its audio into a home stereo system.\n  In addition to the built-in iPod music player application, there are several ""streaming radio"" apps\n  available that allow you to use your iPad as an ""internet radio"".\n\n  6. Huge library of new and existing applications.\n  There are already thousands of applications written specifically for the iPad.  The iPad also does a\n  decent job of playing 95% of existing iTouch/iPhone applications.  With over 150,000 programs available,\n  there are applications already available for just about anything you can think of many of which are free.\n  My application list includes, streaming internet radio, video players, card games, and news/weather\n  sites. I've also downloaded the iBooks application which is an excellent book reading program.  Many\n  free books are available as well as a good selection of current titles.\n\n  Another great built-in app is ""Maps"". ""Maps"" is incredible, not only in its ease-of-use but in its ability\n  to show your current location.  True, the WiFi only iPad has no GPS but via WiFi signals the iPad can\n  often compute your approximate location.\n\n  7. Great battery life!\n  Even if you use it to play movies constantly or listen to non-stop internet radio, you'll\n  get around 10 hours or more use per battery charge.  With the lastest software update from Apple, battery\n  life seems even better.  Even after several months of regular use, I'm getting 10 hours or more of use\n  per charge.\n\nThere are some ways the iPad could have been made better.  Here are the not-so-good aspects about the iPad:\n\n  1. Glossy screen has its drawbacks.\n  My #1 concern before buying the iPad was, ""Will I be able to put up with the glossy screen?"".  Indeed, now\n  that I have had my iPad for 3+ weeks, my #1 complaint is the glossy screen.  Under certain lighting\n  conditions (outside in the shade or watching dark movie scenes indoors or out), the reflections on the\n  iPad's glass screen become a real annoyance.  A matte like finish on the glass (like what you would find\n  on most high quality computer monitor screens) would be a huge plus.\n\n  2. Awkward to hold without a case.\n  When I bought my iPad, I also picked up Apple's $40 iPad case.  Glad I did as, without the case,\n  the iPad is not very comfortable to hold and can easily slip out of one's hands.  With the case, the\n  experience is entirely different.  Apple's rubberized case makes the iPad comfortable and very easy\n  to hold onto.  It also provides the iPad with excellent protection and allows you to prop up your iPad\n  when at a table.  If you buy an iPad, buy it with a case like Apple's that allows you to use the unit\n  without having to remove it from its case.  The $40 Apple case seems pricey but I wouldn't take my iPad\n  anywhere without it.\n\n  3. Not a stellar ""WiFi performer"".\n  I've had no difficulty using my iPad around the house or at work.  But compared to my Acer laptop, the\n  iPad's overall WiFi performance is weaker than I'd like it to be.  The number of hotspots it can detect\n  at any given location is only a small fraction of what my laptop can detect. Also, occasionally I'll go to\n  a restaurant (say McDonald's) that has free WiFi and for some odd reason I cannot get my iPad to connect\n  even with a strong signal present.  Overall though, I've found the iPad to have a very reliable (if not\n  very sensitive) WiFI capability.\n\n  4. On-screen keyboard a bit disappointing.\n  Though I feel there is plenty of room for it, the on-screen keyboard does not have the number keys on the\n  same display as the alphabet.  One has to constantly toggle back and forth between keyboards when entering\n  alphanumeric data.  I hope Apple fixes this in a future software update.\n\n  5. Kind of a heavy unit.\n  1.5 pounds may not seem like much.  But prolonged use (several hours at a time) of the iPad can cause one\n  to have sore wrist/hands just from holding the unit.  The longer I've had my iPad the less it's weight has\n  bothered me.  Perhaps one day, with newer screen technology, Apple can move away from using so much glass\n  and lower the weight of this unit to under 1 pound.\n\nI've had my iPad for 3 weeks and have been using it extensively for web surfing, TV viewing, PDF reading, music listening, and game playing.  The performance of this device is amazing.  Almost every operation and function responds instantly to your command.  This truly is a versatile device that I'll be using for years to come.\n\nI've been waiting many years for an affordable tablet PC that could do what the iPad does.  My wait is over.";The first affordable tablet computer worth buying!
226;22.0;1.0;64.0;If you are used to dealing with Amazon, and then you start dealing with Apple, pray that you never have a problem with the product. Amazon stands behind their products and gives the customer the benefit of the doubt. Apple is very difficult when you have a malfunction. I had to go to small claims to get my money back for something that was not my fault,after dealing with Apple service for two months. read their return and repair policy carefully.;Beware of Return policy
35;23.0;2.0;56.0;"I got my iPad a little over two months ago. It's a nice device that can do lots of stuff, but I guess the problem for me is that it doesn't do anything my laptop/iPhone can't do, there's plenty of stuff that my laptop can do that my iPad can't do, and the things my iPad can do, it can't do as well as other machines.\n\nApple's marketing for the device gives you many impressions. For example, that the iPad is thin and light, and therefore easily portable. That the iPad ""puts the internet in your hands"", giving you the ability to browse the whole internet with swipes of your fingers. That it's ""magical and revolutionary"". That $499 is an incredible deal for all of this. Unfortunately, the longer I own my iPad, the more I drift to the conclusion that none of these claims are true.\n\nThe iPad is certainly thin, no thicker than my first-generation iPhone. It's fairly light, at 1.5 pounds, much lighter than my laptop or even my netbook. The question is, does that make it any easier to use? And the answer is no. The bottom line is that the iPad is still a 10"" device, and once you take into account that it needs to have a case to be protected, it becomes thicker and heavier. (By the way, Apple's case for the iPad is going to run you about $40.) I'm a student that lugs around 10lb textbooks on a daily basis. It doesn't make a difference to me whether the computer in my backpack is a 4.5lb laptop or a 1.5lb tablet. The iPad is no more portable than a laptop.\n\nWhen in use, the iPad won't seem like a thin and light device. Unlike a laptop, which can rest on a desk or your lap, you have to pretty much constantly hold your iPad at the angle that's best for you, and since you need one hand to interact with the device, the job of holding it will be delegated to the other hand. This becomes tiresome after a very short period of time. Although I like the idea of being able to watch a movie on Netflix or read a Kindle book for iPad for extended periods of time, this really isn't feasible. Both of those activities are better-suited for a laptop (or a TV/paperback if you're old-fashioned). If Apple could make the iPad less than a pound, it would greatly help. You could also buy a stand for the iPad,[...]. There goes another $30.\n\nSo the iPad is no easier to carry around than a laptop and its weight makes it difficult to use for extended periods. So how does it perform when you're actually using it? It does fine for almost all tasks. Netflix videos load quickly, movies rented or purhased from iTunes look fantastic, music from the native iPad applications or Rhapsody or Pandora sound great, etc. I do wonder, though, if the touch interface used by the iPad is really logical. The touch interface in the iPod touch/iPhone makes some sense, because it allows the screen to be much bigger (instead of having many small buttons). On the iPad however, constantly flicking the screen doesn't seem as intuitive. Scrolling through a long list of musical artists for example takes much more grandiose hand movements than it does for an iPhone. Am I saying the touch interface doesn't work well, or can't be fun? No, but I am suggesting that using a mouse or track pad for a screen this large might make more sense. The touch interface of the iPad is not compelling. When using Safari I often think that my laptop can browse the internet much easier.\n\nTyping on the iPad is another problem. While the on-screen popup keyboard is a decent size (about the size of the keyboard on my netbook), trying to do serious typing with a 2-dimensional interface is tough. Again, it's easy enough to type with your thumbs on an iPhone because all keys are within easy reach. But if you try to type on the iPad at anything above 40 words per minute (I type 110 words a minute on a proper computer), you will make myriad mistakes that Autocorrect won't fix. The popup keyboard also has the unfortunate side effet of obstructing a third of the screen, making everything feel cramped. Also, you frequently have to interrupt your typing to access a symbol that's much easier to access on a real keyboard. Overall, typing on the iPad is a frustrating experience. Typing up comments on a blog post on Safari might be doable; don't even entertain for a moment that you might be able to type up an entire document on the iPad. Of course, you can buy an external keyboard for the iPad which would make text input a lot faster and easier, but then you have the problem of how to hold the iPad and type at the same time. If you want to go this route, Apple's keyboard will set you back another $70 for the wireless keyboard and $80 for the keyboard dock.\n\nI will touch upon one final subject, the apps. It's really amazing what you can do with an iPod touch or iPhone with the thousands of apps available for those devices. My iPhone is at once a phone, text messaging device, calculator, voice recorder, camera, MP3 player, video player, pocket computer, game player, metronome, etc. On the iPad, the apps aren't as impressive. A laptop can already do all of those things for free, so it doesn't feel thrilling to pay $3.99 for a simple metronome app in the App Store, or $7.99 for a word processing app when Open Office is completely free. The iPad is really quite a limited device in what it can do, and again the touch interface more often is a hindrance than a compelling benefit. I bought a music composition app for $12.99 that's absolutely dreadful; I wish I could get a refund because it's now a worthless placeholder on my home screen.  Finally, games on the iPad are often awkward because of the size of the device. Devices like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS are designed to fit into your hands nicely. The iPod touch is small enough to work as a gaming device. The iPad is too large and not designed for gaming at all, even simple gaming. For example, the game China Town Wars is quite fun on the iPod touch, and you would think that the generous screen of the iPad would make it even more fun. Unfortunately, you have to stretch out your fingers to even reach some of the controls, greatly limiting the fun potential. Games like Doodle Jump which force you to physically move the iPad quickly get tiring because of the weight of the machine.\n\nUltimately, I think what people want from the iPad is an exciting and easy new way to browse the internet and consume media, but the interface that's used by laptops and computers is by far the superior way to do those things. The iPad has made me realize that I never had a problem with the way my laptop functions, and that part of the reason the iPhone works so well is because it fits into your pocket. The iPad tries to bridge the gap between the two, and the result is an anemic compromise. You get neither the portability of the iPhone nor the power and ease of use of a laptop. On a related note, 16GB of storage memory for a device like this is pathetic. My music collection alone is 40GB, and movies are at least 1GB a pop. You can get a more expensive iPad with slightly more memory, but at that point, the iPad becomes more expensive than half-decent laptops, and you have to start wondering when you have to give in to reason.\n\nI would give the iPad 1 star, but I'm giving it 2 because of the build quality (the aluminum backing is nice and the touch screen does work very well), and the battery life, which is sufficient so that you don't need to carry around the charger with you if you decide to take the iPad out. The iPad starts up from sleep in just a couple seconds, app load times are shorter than program load times on computers, and the sound quality from the speakers is better than most laptops. The iPad looks and runs smooth; it loses no points on presentation.\n\nAs someone who owns a laptop and iPhone, I have failed to find a groove for my iPad. There's never a time when I think ""My iPad can do this better than my laptop or phone."" If you don't have an iPod Touch or iPhone, get one of those instead of an iPad. If you don't have a laptop, get one of those before you get an iPad. A netbook costs only $285 these days and will give you 10x the storage, more RAM and processing speed, a bigger screen (10"" vs. 9.7""), a physical keyboard, a webcam, etc.\n\nThe iPad is an interesting device, but can't currently compete with the form factor of a laptop or handheld iOS device.";"I haven't found a ""groove"" for my iPad"
246;24.0;4.0;57.0;So i went out and bought this brand new Apple iPad on the very fist day. I am very satisfied, but have decided to attempt to return it. Ill explain that.\n\nFor the stuff it does (apps, ebooks, games, music, pics, videos, etc) it does it all flawlessly and i couldn't possibly complain about any of it. Beyond expectations actually!\n\nThe problem is it is BIG! I figured i would use it to watch movies or shows on my boring train ride every day. But what do i do with it when im not using it? If i carried a briefcase this wouldnt be an issue, but i dont. I can leave it on my lap, but then i risk either dropping it or being targeted by some thug who wants a new $700 toy for free.\n\nThe other issue is that its DELICATE! Anyone with an iphone or ipod knows just how delicate these screens are ... and this one is even bigger than those! You can tell its made well, but a single drop will break the screen guaranteed.\n\nSo while i do think its an amazing device, i think i can easily live without it. Maybe it would have been an easier decision to keep it if it hadn't cost me $700 ($499 + tax + replacement insurance which you MUST have!!)\n\nThat's all. Good luck with yours, enjoy.\n\nPS, im not happy about spending $700 on something and it doesn't even come with a case or protective screen?? Common apple seriously!!! And then they boast the HD screen for movies ... but the movies cost $20 EACH!! They boast the ebook reader, but the good illustrated books are expensive!! Common how much money do i have to have so i can enjoy this thing??;The iPad is amazing, but ill return it
73;25.0;2.0;54.0;I purchased an iPad for my wife who loves the instant on, the very portable form factor and the many uses for this device provided by the multitude of varied Apps that you can purchase for iPad.\n\nI had heard about the scuffle that Apple and Adobe were going through around Flash support for the web browser but didn't think the issue was of much consequence.\n\nAs my wife and I have been using the iPad it is becoming very apparent to us just how much Flash is used on the internet. It infuriates me that this device can't perform such a basic function (simple internet browsing) without stumbling over Flash and forcing me to go to my home computer to finish the task.\n\nWhat was Steve Jobs thinking? I am so upset over this issue I am hoping that Google, Cisco, Microsoft eat his lunch until he gets some sense knocked into him.\n\nSTEVE! Support Flash on the iPad!

238;27.0;3.0;56.0;There has been a lot of hype about iPad being a Kindle killer. There are three reasons why the iPad will not make a good book reader. You should be aware of these reasons if you are buying the iPad expecting to read books on it.\n\nReason 1) You will want to read outside and the iPad will not look good outside. Lets face it. Readings a novel is relaxing. Reading outside on a beatiful day is really relaxing. An ebook has to address reading outside. iPad has an LCD screen which will wash out in sunlight. Devices like Kindle and Sony Reader use e-ink technology, a completely different rendering technology, that actually looks better in daylight.\n\nReason 2) iPad is too heavy. The iPad weighs 1.6 pounds. That's about 26 ounces. A Sony Reader and Kindle weigh about 9 to 10 ounces. The iPad weighs almost three times as much. You should be able to hold an ebook with one hand suspended in the air. This will maximize the number of comfortable positions you can achieve with the device. At 1.6 pounds, you will find you cannot hold it up for long with one hand and will have to rest it on something. This severly limits the ergonomic possibilities for the device. You may think this is not important, but you should not overlook how important this is for the reading experience. As matters go, the iPad is not a good device to watch a two hour movie on. Since it is heavy, you will tend to rest it on your lap. That will force you to look down on it. Two hours of doing that, your neck will be sore.\n\nReason 3) Battery life is too short. Ten hours seems like a long time, but for an ebook, it is a hassle to keep it charged to just read, especially when you are on the go. When you toss a small 10 ounce Kindle in your suit case before leaving for a week vacation, you will not have to take the charger, and you will not have to be concerned about plugging it in at the hotel. Devices that use e-ink use power to render the page and to say on standby, but do not use power to leave the page displayed. E-ink devices essentially sip power compared to LCD technology that has to constantly backlight the screen and constantly render the screen. This takes much more power.\n\nIn iPads defence, iPad could be the better device to read a newspaper. You generally don't read the paper for very long, and you don't read a newspaper linearly like a book. Beautiful layout, color, and multi-touch input could lead to a better newspaper experience. Plus a newspaper is updated daily. An easy way to get daily editions is essential to reading a paper. I think iPad wins out for reading a paper, but not for reading a book.;Don't expect iPad to be an electronic book reader
10;28.0;5.0;26.0;You might be thinking, is this tablet still worth buying in 2015? I would say the answer is a yes, for several reasons. First of all you can pick one up for $100. If you compare it to other tablets in this price range it has impressive features like a 9.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen Multi-Touch display with IPS technology. 1024-by-768-pixel resolution as well as being able to enjoy 10 hours of use between charges. It is very well built, solid, and the touch screen accuracy and quality is really unseen in this price range. I have seen reviews where people are complaining about it having IOS 5.1.1 and that being a limiting factor for apps, this is true there are not very many apps available for it anymore. However you can still use any mobile website (m.websitename.com). So for instance, the you tube app is out of date, but you can create a shortcut on your home screen for m.youtube.com which works just fine. Same thing for twitter, facebook and other websites that people complain about the app not working for. I even made one for Amazon's mobile website on mine :)  Also I think people should consider the overall quality of this device compared to some cheap chineese tablet for around the same price. These originally cost over $900, so it is a very high quality tablet, something no cheap imitation can say, even if it does use more current apps. I would recommend this tablet for people who do not care about playing games or using the latest apps. It is a very capable tablet for day to day use, like web surfing, turn by turn directions, online bill payment, e-reading, social media, emailing ect...;This tablet is still viable in 2015

Its awkward to hold, its actually quite heavy (although feels nice), the screen is too bright, could hardly see it at all outdoors, wrong aspect ratio for movies etc etc. I knew what this thing couldn't do, but i'm still unaware of what it CAN do! All i see it as is a portal into Steve Jobs pocket. Don't be fooled - this thing is next to USELESS.

219;37.0;4.0;30.0;"We bought the 32G Wifi and been using it for about 10 days now.  This is a review of what the iPad actually IS.  It's not a lot of other things so it's kind of silly to complain about that.  Don't buy it if you want to do something it currently can't do.  Hardly a reason to trash it.\n We are a mixed Mac/PC family with 3 students scattered from elementary school to high school.  This was bought as a gift instead of a Macbook with the enthusiastic consent of the 13 year old who will be the primary user.  It is still probably riding the initial rush any new ""toy"", but I can tell you I'm seriously contemplating buying another when the 3G version comes out.  The second would be a pure luxury purchase admittedly.  This first one though is definitely going to be over subscribed for the foreseeable future as far as I can tell.\n To begin- It's a fascinating piece of technology.  It would probably make a great primary computer for someone who doesn't really need a real desktop or laptop most of the time.  (Grandparents, etc.) Going forward I'll recommend this instead of the Mac minis I've steered people to over the last couple of years. So far we've only gotten the black cover from Mac as an accessory.  It synced easily with our existing iMac and iTunes and immediately uploaded the existing iTouch apps.  I also bought the Pages and Numbers apps for 10 bucks each.  I downloaded both the Kindle app and iBooks to compare.  I also added NPR, Netflix, The Weather Channel app, and the 14 dollar Elements Book/App.  I synced his playlists and tossed on about 500 pictures from last year and this year.  I'll delve a little deeper into most of these.\n\nThe Screen- The screen is very impressive.  It really makes the device what is it obviously.  Then again it sucks up fingerprints to an amazing degree.  Cleans up easily though and you adapt pretty easily to the change.  I can't see how to avoid this problem when you're touching the screen constantly and still expect a flawless picture.\n\nThe E-readers-  iBooks wins on the pure look and feel aspect.  It may just be a temporary effect, but reading in iBooks just felt more like reading a real book.  Kindle wins on the amount of books and cross platform compatibility.  I think I trust Amazon more at this point to keep any purchased books in a format I can count on for a longer period of time.  I have to admit, I'm not fully confident in either company's willingness to port this format 10 or 15 years down the road.  I'll probably stock up on any free books in iBooks for now and purchase anything I need from Amazon's Kindle store.  I haven't sat down and read a full book ""cover to cover"" yet, but I've done some lengthy stretches with both apps.  Please don't hate me, but I found reading on this to be more enjoyable than reading on a Kindle.\n\niPhoto-  Pictures look amazing on this.  I was very easily able to set up slideshows and pair them with tunes from iTunes.  Most of the shots I used were a little over 5mb originally and ported with the ability to zoom in close quite clearly.  I included 1 shot of us standing next to the 20th Maine monument at Gettysburg.  While not really in view in the original shot, I was able to zoom in and read the individually inscribed names very clearly.  This app really wows people with the clarity of the screen/photos.  The sound is pretty good for the size of the device but not amazing.\n\nSafari (Browser)- I'm familiar with and use Safari regularly at home so I found the web experience to be normal for the most part.  I noticed occasional blanks where I guess flash apps would be, but I'm more of a news reader.  I haven't spent a huge amount of time surfing on it, but it seemed fine when I did.  No complaints from the other family members.\n\nNetflix - This was a surprise.  I didn't realize how well this would work.  We were watching The Office within a couple of minutes and the screen is big enough that two can watch and still have it be an immersive experience.  Of course not everything on Netflix is available for instant view, but it's a free app and we're already members so I can't complain.  This was very easy to setup and I'd recommend trying it to anyone.\n\nPages- this the Apple version of Word and on the iPad it's the light version to boot.  That said, it a pretty nifty little word processor that he's used to do homework already.  You have to sync it to iTunes and then open the doc with the full version of Pages or Word.  Here I have a pretty big beef with Apple.  I've got Pages 08 which I bought in late 08 as part of iWorks.  To sync you have to have Pages 09?!  Word 97 is supported but not Pages 08?  I happen to have Word for Mac so it wasn't a big deal but I was really ticked off at the time.  You might even be able to export as a .doc and then load into Pages (didn't think of it at the time) but I don't know for sure.  Either way I can't believe Apple wouldn't support this out of the box.  Anyway, it worked out fine even if it wasn't terribly intuitive.  Going forward he can do it on his own with no problem.\n\nSpecialty Apps - NPR/Weather Channel - I can easily see people getting a little out of control in designing their own apps for no real reason.  Both of these were free and pretty well executed though.  There are many of these out there but I had read reviews on both of these so we started with them.  I imagine we'll add and delete apps frequently over time.\n\nThe Elements: A Visual Exploration- A very impressive educational e-book app that was highly recommended and that I spent a lot of time playing with and reading.  This was a little pricey for an e-book, but it was also rebuilt as app to take advantage of the iPad video capabilities including 3D (haven't gotten the glasses yet).  It's really another wow factor app when showing the app to people.\n\nPro's.  Undeniable cool factor right now (that will fade, I know).\n Beautiful executed form and basic functionality.\n Reasonable cost factor for the level of functionality COMBINED with the ease of use and intuitive UI.\n No wifi connectivity issues so far.\n Light weight.\n\nCon's  The things it doesn't have - camera specifically.\n The Pages 08 incompatibility.\n Learning curve for some basics functions\n Printing more cumbersome than it needs to be.\n\nThis is the longest review I've written by far for Amazon, especially considering I didn't even buy the iPad here.  I thought it was important though to get a fairly evenhanded review (yes, I know I like Macs) out there from someone who has actually paid for and used an iPad.  It is not for everyone.  If you have a Kindle already there's no reason you shouldn't keep it and continue reading with it.  If you're an Apple hater because of their DRM/closed garden, I totally understand.  If you're a power PC or Linux user you'll probably have something you can tool around with to your heart's content shortly.  For a pretty large group though, I think this is a very viable option to do a lot useful/fun things without traumatizing your already overworked friend/relative who's also your IT guy.";Rate it for what it is, not what it isn't...

244;42.0;5.0;28.0;"I now have been using my iPad for two days. It has gone through a full day workout with my kids (who are enthralled by it) and a full day of work as an itinerant professional in the public schools, using apps that I had purchased for my iPod Touch and using the Netflix app. It has been used as a remote desktop for work; a note taking device; a book reader; a word processing device; and a music player. The only thing it has not yet been used for is games. Movies look impressive on Netflix. As a remote desktop, it runs fairly zippy on a local network, but a tad slow over the Internet. All of my iPod Touch apps run fast, although half of them look somewhat granular in 2X mode. Pages runs really well and opens all of my templates. Someone had commented that it messes up formatting when transferring between files, although this has not been the case with me. Regarding weight, it is lighter than I thought. I can easily whip it out of my carrying case and jot a quick note in the hall. The wifi reception rivals my MacBook. I have yet to drain the battery to check battery life. Overall, it has performed impressively. The only negative thing right now is the fingerprints when the iPad is off. It can look  really dirty and I find myself cleaning it often.";Nice product
146;43.0;4.0;27.0;Like many others, I too was faced with the delimma of buying a netbook v. an iPad. I spent a lot of time researching the products and spent my $ buying both an iPad and what I consider to be the very best netbook on the market today - The Sony Vaio X (unfortunately, Sony has just stopped selling the Vaio X!).\n\nLet me clarify up front that the iPad simply blows away each and every netbook you see in stores like Best Buy in the sub $500 range. Whether it is design, performance or build quality you'll regret buying one of those netbooks for an iPad. So here is my Sony Vaio X v. iPad comparison.\n\n1. Cost:\n\niPad 64 GB wi-fi: 699 (3G wasn't available). But equivalent pricing for features would be + $130 (for 3G) + $ 40 (case since the screen on the ipad is exposed) + $30 for VGA connector + $30 for SD card + usb adapter = $930 (still missing camera).\n\nSony Vaio X(64 GB): $1299 (includes Verizon 3G inbuilt)\n\nGAP: iPad Appox $300 cheaper\n\n2. OS:\n\niPad: iphone OS - instant on, app store, multi touch\n\nSony Vaio X: Windows 7 Professional - powerful\n\nAdvantage: Depends (personally I prefer Win 7 for most things)\n\n3. Design: Surprisingly in terms of weight and thickness both are about the same. However, the carbon fiber body on the vaio x is gorgeous! The Vaio X is NOT like any other netbook in terms of how it is built.\n\nAdvantage: Tablet v. traditional notebook. Again, tablet is better for media and web browsing. Traditional for productivity software like MS Office.\n\n4. Battery: The Vaio comes with a standard 2 hour battery which is blown away by the over 10 hours on the ipad. However, the Vaio also includes a 12 hour extended battery. But this battery increases the weight of the Vaio to 2.5lb, making it about an inch thicker (at its widest) and a pound heavier than the ipad.\n\nAdvantage: Slightly to the ipad, unless you don't care about the extra 1 lb weight added by the XL Vaio battery.\n\n5. Features: Vaio wins this hands down with much better array of expandable memory slots, 2 usb ports and ethrnet cable slot and included VGA port, front facing camera and ability to connect an optical drive if needed (I have a super slim usb powered dvd drive). The ipads biggest advantage is the app store, which is more of a software rather than hardware feature.\n\n6. Screen: ipad's IPS LCD wins this one hands down. On paper the larger, higher resolution LED backlighting Vaio looks more impressive, but the better viewing angle and high quality glass on the ipad screen makes it much easier to read text and watch movies etc.\n\n7. Performance: The biggest advantage of the ipad is that you don't have to wait 60 seconds before you can start using it. Also,the ipad is much faster at connecting to a wifi network.\n\n8. Others: While the iPad gets a lot of attention, so does the vaio x. The fan on the vaio x can be a little distracting when it is on. Overall if I think of the intangibles such as the variety of apps on the app store, the speed at which you can turn on the device and start browsing the web, the email client, the photo viewer app etc etc...the ipad is just a much more compelling device. Last but not least the ipad simply destroys the Vaio or any netbook when it comes to gaming! The ipad is an amazing gaming device. If you haven't tried it....you're missing something.\n\nMY FINAL ANALYSIS: If I didn't have an iphone or ipod touch I'd say this would be a no brainer. The quick access to email and the internet when compared to a netbook like the vaio x is just too great of an advantage for me. When you have to wait for a device for 60 seconds to wake it up from hibernation and remember to put it to sleep so that it does not drain the battery it's just not as convenient as the ipad. Also the screen on the ipad is just amazing....However, I own BOTH an iphone and an ipod touch. Therefore for me the Vaio X is a more useful device. I also have an ebook reader, so while the ipad is a fantastic ebook reader it would be duplicating another device that I already have. I have decided to return my ipad (I am a day away from the 14 day return period) and it will cost me $70 for re stocking and another $50 or so I spent on ipad apps. Hopefully, I'll be able to use some of these apps when I upgrade to iOS4 in the near future. But $120 was the price I had to pay to know for sure that I don't need an ipad (right now). Of course IF my Vaio X were to die, I'd get an ipad in a heart beat :);Pros and cons of an iPad
156;44.0;1.0;27.0;I bought one of these iPads from the Apple store in the mall as a replacement to my 8 year old Toshiba tablet and all I can say it wow, the iPad really lacks functionally and the ability to do multitasking.

212;45.0;4.0;27.0;"I love Apple products so I bought a (Wi-Fi) iPad as soon as it came out. Nine months later I sold it on eBay (a woman in Russia bought it). Why? First, iPad is for consumption, not for producing any content. At the time I did not have a notebook, and I need to send, not only receive emails. iPad has no keyboard and is bad for this. Even after I bought the external Bluetooth Apple keyboard, it was still way too cumbersome. Second, the Wi-Fi reception is not sensitive - Apple Macbooks get much better signal at the same hotspots; I have compared. Third, Wi-Fi alone is not enough. One needs the 3G/4G connection now and then. But this means paying ATT for a second service on top of my iPhone. I refuse. iPad should allow the iPhone to be plugged in to share the 3G network. Fourth, it is cumbersome to get files into the device, needing either iTunes or email. This is inconvenient.\n\nFifth, I discovered I just don't like a touch interface. There, I said it. With the iPhone, it's clearly necessary but for a bigger device, I prefer keyboard and mouse. Touch on the iPad is imprecise and often does not respond immediately. Often necessary to press a spot several times to get a response, or it will not accept input. Frustrating and I'm mystified why more people don't complain about this. The good things about iPad include the long battery life. The iPad is wonderful for many purposes - schools to replace books - but it's not for everyone.\n\n********\n\nUpdate added June 2011. After selling my first iPad, I bought an iPad2 recently to try again. I like it better this time, partly because I now have a MacBook Air also and no longer expecting the iPad2 to be something it's not such as a platform for typing memos. I just use it now to read email and the news in bed, and to read journal articles and magazines. And to carry photos. And for Facetime. This is what it's designed for. Also, the iPad2 is slightly thinner which does make it noticeably easier to handle and the software has been smoothed up. I still feel a bit ripped off that I can't share the 3G connection between my iPhone and iPad; after all, I cannot use both at once so why not use the minutes on the device in use at the moment? Also I would REALLY like to see a USB port to read files on a USB drive. Finally I would like to see the iPad integrated with the MacBook; one would detach the display and it would switch over to being an iOS device. Maybe Apple will offer that someday. Modular devices with integrated services would be much better for consumers. I'm raising the stars rating.";Sold my first iPad but now have an iPad2

237;48.0;4.0;26.0;Summary:\nThe iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.\n\nExterior:\nI admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.\nThe iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.\n\nThe outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.\n\nThe only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.\n\nHardware:\nThe screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.\nMy unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.\nSpeaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.\nOne annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.\n\nThe iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.\nThe iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).\nFinally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]\nFinally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.\n\nUsing the iPad.\nImmediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).\nThe large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.\nThe home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.\n\niTunes (desktop)\nAs with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.\n\nThe iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.\n\nThe iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).\nMail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.\n\nSafari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.\n\nThe Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.\n\nPhotos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configuration\n\nThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.\n\nApp Store\nAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.\n\nI did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.\n\nDedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.\n\nSDK\nThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).\n\nAll in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.\n\nPros\n- drop-dead beautiful device\n- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability\n- App store\n- incredibly long battery life\n- unbelievably crisp screen\n- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)\n- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)\n- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size\n- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)\n- SDK\n\nCons\n- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support\n- 64 GB limit\n- battery built in\n- no Adobe Flash support in Safari\n- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching\n- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)\n- single-user mode only\n- no printing\n- worst filesharing ever\n- screen glare\n- must sync to iTunes;Great device, some seriously rough edges

It's a groovy wonderland where tyrants stealing freedom should not be allowed.\n\nSteve- you're in a fantasy world, hurting your own company for a personal vendetta.  If I were a stockholder, I'd let you go a second time.\n\nOne more thing: its screen is GLASS, folks- like those stores: drop it and it's done.\n\nBut you're made of money, right? So why not?  Go for it. The economy needs it. You'll be envied, just like everybody else.;Not a tool for the Real World
198;51.0;2.0;23.0;"Many reviews have said it (reviews by Apple fanboys and worshippers should be taken with a pinch of salt).\n\n- Good 'instant-on' device for short quick activities like email; but don't expect to type anything longer than a tweet or text message; painfully slow and impractical. As a typer, I tend to rest my fingers on the keyboard - but that is BAD for a touchscreen. For longer emails or typing, I almost always find myself switching to my laptop.\n\n- Very good looks and sleek; good battery life (I go up to 8-10 hours on a single charge)\n\n- The browser doesn't works with more than half of the websites that I normally browse.\n\n- I get neck pain/strain after a while trying to type and read on the same 'plane' (un-natural posture)\n\n- It is NOT a laptop replacement (let alone a killer); it needs a laptop as the 'mothership' for initial setup, software updates, etc. Actually, it uses the same OS as the iPhone/iPod and is identical to an iPod with a bigger screen.\n\n- I always find myself using my iPhone than iPad; iPad is too big to carry in a pocket and too small to be practical and useful like a laptop.\n\n- Can't print anything from it;\n\n- I could have thrown away my paper notepad if iPad had handwriting recognition (or sketch) to take quick notes.\n\n- The glossy screen is practially useless (unless used in a dark room at night); outdoors it is horrendous to read anything easily. Kindle/Nook are the BEST choices for read anything meaningfully 'longer' in content (books, papers, etc).\n\nNet: Still trying to figure out how, where and when I can really use the iPad. I certainly don't want to carry too many gadgets: e-book reader, phone, laptop and a giant-screen MP3 player:-)\n\nMay 1st update: WiFi on iPad is horrendous.

102;52.0;1.0;22.0;"Well, I must first say that my husband one this in a sales contest, so we DID NOT fork over the money for it and boy am I glad!! I could spend $819 and get a laptop computer with many more capabilities!  IMHO, this is WAY too much money for this product.  I find that people are either Pro-Apple or Anti-Apple.  I'm the latter mainly b/c their products are too high priced for what you get.  I have the same capability with my Android phone as an iPhone and I paid less than half the amount for it.  And I'm not subjected to using iTunes to sync everything.  That's my biggest beef.  I like to plug in a media device and pull it up and transfer file folders to it just like another hard drive.  Then load applications for viewing, listening, etc.\n\nBiggest drawbacks:\n1) Due to the ongoing feud b/t Steve Jobs and Adobe, there is NO FLASH SUPPORT.  Therefore, you cannot view many websites such as Hulu.com which have TV shows and such on them.  XM Radio's website also uses Adobe Flash as do many others.  Many gaming sites use Adobe Flash (such as Farmville on FB).  Therefore you cannot view these. The reason Apple does not have Adobe is all over money.\n2) No multitasking.  You can only open one program at a time.  You cannot listen to Pandora and surf the web.  This would be a deal breaker for me if I was in the market for this product.  You can listen to your own music that you put on it, but you cannot listen to any other app.  You cannot have any 2 apps open at the same time.  There is no ability to ""set things down on the desktop"" as it were.  You have to open and close each app.\n3) Screen is 4:3 and not 16:9!  Wow!  Another deal breaker for me.  I can't believe anything is even being manufactured this day and age that isn't 16:9.\n4) Price!!  Absolutely ridiculous for a basic internet surfing, mp3, video player device with a calendar.\n5) In order to load and watch movies you may have on your pc, you have to download a video converter.  Otherwise, you are subjected to purchasing them through the iTunes store.\n6) Air Video (which enables you to watch videos you have loaded into iTunes) will not work with my router which is AT&T 2wire.  Apple does not support AT&T Routers at all. Apple has a list of their supported routers (another reason why you shouldn't buy Apple products).  They rope you into using all of their ""approved"" associates!  Arrrrrrrgh!\n\nWait for Android Tablets!  They will be better and CHEAPER!!!";Too Much for Too Little!

148;54.0;1.0;22.0;I originally purchased this product as a replacement for my netbook.  While I agree that the screen is as everyone else says it is, not being able to charge the iPad from my notebook is a major disadvantage.  Taking away the unlimited data plan makes me feel betrayed by ATT and Apple.  I am returning the device and going back to my netbook.;Disappointed
171;55.0;5.0;22.0;"The first time I saw the iPad was when it was announced with much fanfare and I was instantly smitten.  I've never been an Apple person and have stayed away from their products like crazy, but this thing really stuck in my mind.  Once it was released I went to the Apple store and played with it, like so many other people, and I walked away still liking it.  I figured I would play with it and walk away thinking that it wasn't worth the money or didn't work the way I wanted it to.  I was wrong.  I found myself looking up reviews just about everyday seeing what other people thought about it and finally happened to be in a store when they had some in stock and I took the plunge.  Was I nervous?  Yes.  Was I afraid that it would just be a toy and that was it?  Yes.  Was I scared about the price?  Yes.  However, I typically feel that way before any large electronics purchase.\n\nWhat I have found in the month I've owned my iPad is that I carry it with me all over the house.  If I'm reading something on the internet and need to go in the other room....I take my iPad.  A lot of people have been bashing the iPad without every really using one and I can honestly say that it has changed how I consume entertainment.  It's not a replacement for a laptop or netbook, though it certainly could replace a lot of things that you use them for, but it is its own ""thing"".  When it really clicked for me was about a week ago.  It was a lazy Saturday afternoon and I was home by myself.  I was using the Netflix app to catch up on a show that I had missed a few episodes of and I started out watching it on the couch.  Soon I carried my iPad into the kitchen with me to make lunch.  Then went outside and sat on the deck.  I even took it into the bathroom with me....never having to stop watching the show.  The iPad haters out there would say that they could do the same thing with their laptop, but the iPad battery is so great that it gave me true freedom to move about the house without worrying about wires, batteries or anything else.  This is the true value of the iPad to me.  I can consume entertainment/information anywhere in the house instead of having to stay in one place.  Before I would either go to the office or sit on the couch to browse the internet with the laptop.  That way I had a power cord nearby.  With a 10 hour battery, I don't worry about that anymore.\n\nNow, will it replace my need for a laptop?  No.  There are things I still need to do that will require more storage or programs that cannot be done on the iPad.  However, I'm okay with that.  If you are someone that spends a lot of time on your computer looking up things on the internet or watching movies or just wasting time.  You will be amazed at the freedom you feel with the iPad.";iPad is my first Apple product and I love it
189;56.0;3.0;21.0;The 3G looks the same as the wifi except for a black, plastic bar visible on the top and in the back of the device. Before buying the 3G, visit the apple site for the additional monthly data plans that you need to purchase.

199;57.0;2.0;21.0;"The iPad is full of the promise for the future and when you buy it, that's what you are banking on - that things will be awesome in the future. I purchased the 64-Gig Wi-Fi version on day one and immediately had problems with it. I arrived at my hotel from my business meeting at about 5pm and wanted to play with my new toy. It took 3hrs to sync my 50 Gig iTunes Library because it kept crashing, it was nightmare because it kept finding ""corrupted"" files during the sync process and crashing - these are files I purchased in iTunes and had to DELETE before the sync would work and to make matters worse I can't re-download those files, so if I want another Digital copy of Terminator - that work, I would have to buy it (even though it had always synched fine before). It's why I loathe DRM. The hotel that I was in only used a hard wired connection, so I had to go down to the lobby to use the WiFi and set up all my apps which wasn't cool. Due to the lack of multi-tasking it took almost two hours to set up my apps like the Kindle, Marvel, etc. Because I could only download one book at a time and I had to sit there and watch the download progress bar. It was almost 11pm by the time I finally got everything setup.\n\nAt the Airport, I didn't want to pay $10 for two hours of WiFi (another reason I hate WiFi only devices, most places charge too much money for it and it rarely works well), so I tried to watch a couple of movies and the screen completely washed out in the ""bright"" light. I couldn't see any movies that were ""dark"" like Harry Potter, Xfiles, etc.  After one day of minimal use this thing had Smudges all over the place, it looked ugly when turned off. Luckily the smudges don't really show when it's turned on.\n\nThe real trouble started when I got home. The thing refused to stay connected to my Verizon Fios network. Every time it woke from sleep not only did I have to reconnect but I had to re-enter my Network ID, reading web sites became an exercise in frustration because it disconnected literally every 2 or 3 minutes. And a lot of Apps simply ""crashed"" the second the connection was lost. So it failed miserably at it's most basic function. I found it to be too big, heavy and uncomfortable to actually read in Bed, I actually had to lay it down in landscape mode with a little prop stand provided by the iPad case to read it. If I had to do that, I'd might as well use a laptop. I'm assuming I would have gotten used to holding if I had more time to play with it, but I only had an unreasonable 14 days to return it.\n\nWhen Apps work, they were beautiful to look at and use - Plants Vs. Zombies, Marvel, Comixology, ABC, Yahoo (surprisingly amazing free app), Kindle, Zinio, etc. The Apps is why you get this. The problem is a lot of these apps are way too much where they are .99 or 2.99 on the iPhone, they are inflated to $10 and up on the iPad. The price inflation is ridiculous, especially considering most of these apps won't work on your iPhone. I'd be willing to pay $7 or $8 if they worked on both.\n\nFor a device that's $900 (it's only worth purchasing the 3G 64 Gig Model - you will fill up the 16 and 32 gigs quickly when the apps are averaging almost a gig), it's damn difficult to actually get my files onto the device. I have a bunch of Comic book .jpgs, word docs, etc. that I would like use, but have yet to figure out how to actually get them on the device. I broke down and bought the Pages App because that was supposed to make it easy, but it did nothing to help me get my files over. So that was a waste of money. Apple just screwed over iPad users by delaying the release of the SDK 4.0 that brings multi-tasking until this fall.\n\nSo yes, I returned the WiFi version, I'm tempted to get the 3G version but $900 is just too much for a device that's only based on potential, and not what it actually is today. It also kills me that I kind of miss having it and I would be rewarding Apple for making the WiFi version so Gimpy that I'm forced to purchase the 3G when I already know how bad AT&T's 3G is.";Wait 3G Version, Not Worth The Money, WiFi didn't work
129;58.0;1.0;20.0;Amazing, a big iPhone with no USB port and no Flash!\n\nWith many thousands of website developers integrating Flash into their websites and applications it is a sad thing to see Apple escalate their petty feud with Adobe by not including Flash in their hardware.

76;61.0;1.0;19.0;The iPad has been the talk of the town since it's Apple created it however, it does not deserve the credit that most consumers give it. The iPad is a somewhat new Tablet computer that virtually serves no purpose with netbooks and compact notebooks. It is just another innovative idea that all Apple fan-boys and Bandwagon jumpers can rave about. While the technology is convenient on an iPod touch, once you double the size you would expect more. The iPad runs at a processor speed of 1.00ghz, which is the same speed my phone runs at. Another big disappointed is the iPad's incapability to run flash websites. It has the same apps as the iPod Touch and iPhone. The hard drive size on the iPad is also very disappointing, having the same size hard drives as the iPod Touch. The WiFi is faulty at times, but that is not to terrible of a problem. The price is also ridiculously high for what you're getting. Similar tablets, such as the Archos 5 lack the apps, but can do much more that the iPad can. Why pay around $800 for a tablet that can barely handle the tasks you would expect it to, when you could purchase a netbook, at less than half the price with a much large hard drive, much faster processor, and can do almost everything you would expect it to do? Well, I guess you have to pay for the name.;Not what it is hyped up to be...
90;62.0;1.0;19.0;No flash, too heavy to read books, no webcam,,therefore no Skype, can't just view all those videos your children send you by email, screen too touchy, no USB port, apps are too expensive and most are inferior, too heavy to carry around in a large handbag or tote, 3G is ridiculously expensive and the price of the iPad is way too expensive for just a pretty face. As for support, forget about it. I spent months downloading library books and my own CD music. Then one day it was all gone. I called Apple and they said I could pay for assistance but I was past the 3 mos mark for free help. Are they kidding. Hours upon hours of downloading was lost and they do not care. One day a new tablet will come out to blow them out of the water. The kindle and Nook already blow them away as to ease of reading and weight. Any tablet that is lightweight will be better. Their apps are a joke. This is like the childrens story about the Emporer who has no clothes. There is no substance, it's just about more money for music, books, audiobooks and videos. Limited compatibility with free library content on purpose. Foolish purchase!;Where do I begin.....lost all my library books and music
110;63.0;3.0;19.0;"I love almost everything Apple, but the iPad just isn't there yet, primarily because it doesn't replace anything with better functionality -- not a netbook, not a Kindle, not an iPhone.  Yes, the display is absolutely gorgeous with its intense colors and sharp graphics.  Yes, it is sleek and easy to slip into a briefcase.  Yes, video and photos cannot look any better on a portable device.  But . . . .\n\nThe iPad is dependent in part on apps that you can purchase in the iTunes store; however, many of those apps are either incompatible with the iPad (showing up on the tablet in iPhone screen size) or cost money.  There just aren't many free iPad apps the way there are with the iPhone.  The apps that do exist, whether for a price or free, just don't add much to the iPad's functionality.\n\nWhile the touchscreen keyboard is much easier to use than that of its cousin the iPhone (because of its larger size), it's not built for typing more than a few quick emails or notes.  Plus, if you use Word on your main computer, you can't install it on the iPad the way you can on a netbook.  You're stuck with Apple's note program or a separate productivity app purchased from the App Store.  As far I can tell, the only way to share notes is to email them.  You cannot edit an existing document.\n\nAs an e-reader, it doesn't compare to the more portable, more book-like, lighter-weight Kindle 2, except in the case of books that have color photos and/or animated graphics.  It may compete well with the larger Kindle DX, although I don't have one of those to compare.  To download books, you have to be on a wireless network, unlike the Kindle, which uses free Whispernet for downloads. (Note: the iPad with 3G can download anywhere if you pay for monthly 3G service.) When I read on the iPad, it feels more like a computer than a book; the Kindle feels more like a book.\n\nThe iPad does not have a camera, either still or video.  It does have a microphone for voice memos.  Its speakers are much better than those of the iPhone 4; you can start up the iPod and put the iPad on a table to listen while you do other things.  Still, I have a computer and separate iPod players in the areas of the house; music coming through real speakers sounds so much better.  I do like that I can play music while using other apps, just the way I can on all versions of the iPhone.  Its the only example of multitasking on the iPad.\n\nI'm leaving this iPad for my husband to use.  I'll get another when Apple releases a version that has a camera and FaceTime; when it can share and edit files; when more (useful) free apps are available; when it allows multiple open window/apps the way the Mac OS does -- in short, when it successfully replaces one or more of my other devices.\n\nThe iPad has tremendous potential that isn't yet realized, but it is a fun toy to play around with.  As to whether you should purchase this wireless version or the 3G, consider how you would use this and whether you want to pay for 3G service.  You can tether your later model iPhone; however, that's an additional fee from ATT as well.  I recommend the iPad for tech geeks who have to own the newest toys -- and as toys go, this is great.  For the rest of you, hold off for a generation or two until Apple begins to fully utilize the power of this slender tablet.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann";Gorgeous, but its potential is not yet realized
8;64.0;1.0;7.0;We received iPad in good order, however, due to the OS only 5.1.1, nothing works.  No games for this OS, it tells us to upgrade to 6 or 7 to get games.  But we can't because the 5.1 is the highest level this iPad can use.  So using the Internet is out also.  Pages will not load due to the os.\nVery disappointed and will return.;Don't bother, nothing will work due to OS
58;65.0;4.0;18.0;"I received my iPad in May so this is a 7 month review.\n\nIn general, I dislike Apple for the restrictions that they place on their hardware, interfaces and software (especially iTunes).  Loyal PC/Windows user since 1985.  I generally subscribe to the open-source mantra ""If you can't open it, you don't own it.""  I have only personally owned one other Apple product (the clip iPod shuffle which I liked for its size, simplicity and durability).  I have never owned an iPhone and though my wife has an iPod Touch I was never a big fan of that.  I have heard reference that iPad is a big iPhone or Touch...possibly as I never fully explored either of those two options.\n\nWith all that said, I absolutely love my iPad.  I did not think I would and was looking towards a Kindle or Sony E-Reader when I got the 64g/3g as a gift from my wife.  I will not rehash the specs or the features...instead, this is what I like and dislike:\n\nWhat I use it for:\n- Time Wasting: #1 use.  This year I had to spend lots of time in hospital waiting rooms.  This was a Godsend!!  Movies, books, games, Facebook and email.  It kept me from being too bored anywhere I know I will be waiting : Airport, DMV, Dr Office, Parole Board, Parent-Teacher meetings...\n- Reading: In bed at night, at the gym on the elliptical, on the plane.  The reader is a good one.  I have lots of ePubs and it handles them very well.  Magazine PDFs look great.\n- Web Browsing: I prefer Atomic vs. Safari and the browser works well.  Miss Flash, but not terribly.\n- Facebook: Using the Friendly app due to lack of Flash conflicting with the picture uploader FB uses.  Easy to use and quick.\n- Games: At $0 to $5 (for most game apps) the iPad is an ever changing game platform.  I probably have bought 50+ of them by now.  Get bored?  Get another cheap.  Sure a PSP functions better, but try cycling through 50 games in a PSP...big $$$ and trips to the store!\n- News: USA Today, NPR, CNN, SkyGrid and Instapaper are my primary news apps.  I review them in the morning on the elliptical at the gym...no way to do that easily with paper.\n- Travel Apps: Flight Tracker, Weather, GPS, Maps, UrbanSpoon, Goby, etc.  All useful when traveling.\n- Crossword Puzzles and Words With Friends: hooked on both these apps.\n\nWhat has it replaced?\n- Calendar/Contacts: Synced to my online and Outlook calendars it acts as a planner substitute.\n- GPS: in the car using the $3 Motion X Drive GPS.  I like it better than the one integrated into my car (that I paid more than $3 for).\n- Books & Magazines: Like going on vacation with a library without the bulk.\n- HP 12c Financial Calculator: Expensive app ($12) but one less thing to carry.\n- Laptop:  Not a true substitute but pretty close for much of what I used it for - especially for traveling (browsing, email, picture storage, etc).  I have not fired up the laptop since I got the iPad.\n- MP3 player: I use it, but I am not wowed by it.\n- Smart Phone: Possibly...not sure on this one yet.  The phone can do most of what the pad can do but it is SO small!!\n- VCR/DVD: We have a TV connection cable and it becomes a portable video player for travel.\n\nLike\n- Build quality:  It's heavy and well finished. It feels solid and looks sleek.  The Kindle, E-Reader, and other readers do not measure up.  Even the Galaxy (which I view as the closest substitute) does not ""feel"" as good.  Not very scientific...but it is what it is.\n- App Store:  With 300,000+ apps, the app store seems to have at least one app to do whatever I am looking to accomplish.  THIS is the key to the iPad (and probably iPhone and Touch as well, though I confess ignorance here).\n- Size:  I am 47 and now need glasses for reading.  The screen size is great.  Can't imagine squinting at a SmartPhone screen for some of these functions.  Typing is very easy compared to a smartphone though not as easy as a PC.  About the same as a small laptop.\n- User Interface Experience:  Smooth, seamless, instant response.  Very, very well polished.  Have played with Android devices (Galaxy Tab and Droid X) and don't see the same polish.\n- Camera Interface: Basically an SD card reader for the iPad.  Backs up my camera easily.\n\nDislike\n- Size:  Need a ""man-purse"" or ""European Should Bag...it was a gift!"" to carry it.  Most of the time I keep it tucked under my arm.  It is also pretty heavy to hold and read a book.  I keep it propped up somewhere to do read extensively.  But...heavy = build quality.\n- No Flash:  Should play it.  No reason not to.  I personally have not experienced a lot of problems with this but I do not frequent youtube or gaming sites.  I see it on maybe 15-20% of the sites I visit and generally can work around it.  I am told HTML5 is the cure...we'll see.\n- No Camera:  Should have one (or two) and should shoot video too.  Bad oversight.\n- Charging:  Though battery life is OK (I must charge mine every night), the 10Watt charger is annoying.  Wish the standard 5W USB would work.\n- Cases:  Yeah.. you will want a case.  2 options - minimalist or protection.  I use the Apple minimalist case and like it, but it does not offer much protection and the viewing/display options are limited.  With more options and/or protection, size becomes even more problematic.\n- Photo Album:  I can move my videos, TV shows and Books around...why can't I organize my pictures!?!?!  More of an oversight than a flaw but annoying.\n\nWhat to buy?\n- Want an eReader?  Look at the file formats they can handle and the hardware quality (controls, viewing, etc).\n- Want a tablet (I think this is the genre)?  Look at the apps and the ability of the hardware to handle them well.  This is the key to the whole experience!!  Software that works well with the device, which can be downloaded on demand and managed in modules. Apple appears to have done this well.\n\nIn summary, although not previously an Apple fan, I really am impressed by my iPad.  I liken it to my first digital camera (a gift device that I also did not want) which changed the way I viewed and used photography.  The iPad fills a gap in lower end mobile computing that I didn't really even perceive was there until I got it.  The Apple control/oversight is both restrictive and enhances the user experience.  So far, I have found it to be more useful than detrimental.  Like my pocket digital camera, I take the iPad with me most everywhere.\n\nHope this helps.";Very pleasantly surprised
92;66.0;5.0;18.0;"When I first wanted the iPad everyone I knew said the same thing, ""Isn't it really just a bigger iPhone?""  Well, no but, at the same time, yes.  That was perfect for me.  Each time I used my iPhone I thought, ""I wish this was bigger so I could do more.""  Much like any time that I used my Kindle and would think, ""If only the web interface was better and this was in color.  If only it was faster.""  The iPad filled all of those needs.\n\nMy Kindle was sold on eBay with in days of the iPad's arrival.  My laptop suddenly spent days sitting idle and untouched as my iPad took its place as my primary mode of web browsing.  Magazine subscriptions were halted as I waited patiently for iPad versions.  I could not be happier with publications like Vanity Fair and the New Yorker.\n\nI did buy a case and the Bluetooth keyboard for the iPad.  I found that these items added to the functionality and enabled me to get even more from the iPad.  I chose the option with 3G because, so often, when I had my Kindle and iPhone out in the world, I took advantage of the Internet access.  I did not want to have to rely on the existence of free or pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi.\n\nHere's a quick run-down of my impressions and how I rate each user experience.\n\n+ Web browsing - 5 stars\nIt is wonderful to be able to sit back and read a long article without craning my neck to look at the monitor.  The only downside is that I now spend a lot more time browsing the web than my pre-iPad self did.\n\n+Reading eBooks - 5 stars\nI have owned a Kindle and a Sony Reader.  While I understand the benefits of e-ink, I have to say that they are a bit overstated.  Yes, it is nice not to consume so little power and not have to deal with a back-lit screen to some extent.  However, unlike my laptop or computer monitor, the iPad screen does not bother my eyes even after prolonged periods of reading.  Also, it is terrific to be free from an external lighting source on airplanes or in bed.  With the e-ink devices, I often felt that the glare from any of the booklights I tried was distracting and difficult on my eyes.  I do not have that problem with the iPad.  All of my Kindle books are just as enjoyable on the Kindle for iPad app.  It's easy to use and the highlighting and dictionary features are even more useful without having to use the clumsy interface to navigate the Kindle screen.\n\n+Outdoor use - 3 stars\nThe screen is much tougher to see outdoors.  It's almost unusable in many cases.  Since I wear polarized sunglasses, I have to turn the screen to horizontally to even see it.  If I have them on and have the screen in portrait mode, it is totally black.  This is not a big problem for me since I don't really take an eBooks to the beach and rarely find myself in full sunlight wishing I could search the web.  It is fine in even slight shade so sidewalk cafes are still an option.\n\n+Business use - 5 stars\nThe calendar and contacts on the iPad are much more useful to me than those on the iPhone.  Having a larger screen makes the calendar feature much easier to use if you are navigating a day full of appointments.  I was awestruck when I first opened it after years of trying to get by with a Blackberry or an iPhone.  I also downloaded an app that allows me to store and read PDFs.  This was inexpensive and made keeping track of everything from whitepapers to meeting notes much easier.  I am anti-paper and this device really allowed me to put away all of my paper notebooks and avoid printing for weeks at a time.  I also have two mind map applications that are excellent for brainstorming and developing the top-level outline for a new project.\n\n+Movies (Netflix) - 5 stars\nThe clarity is amazing - even when I am on the 3G network.  I've also downloaded videos from the iTunes store and they are just as perfect.  If it was possible to give it 500 stars, I might be so inclined.";I use it every day...

166;68.0;2.0;18.0;The iPad is sexy, but that wears off in a hurry. I thought that not having Flash would be a nit. Why do I need fancy advertisements that wiggle? It is a huge issue. Boeing won't even let you onto it's 747 website using an iPad. CNBC has lots of pages that aren't available. I don't know if Apple is arrogant or if they have a fundamental misunderstanding of the Internet. Based on my own experience with the 64mb Wifi model, it was a waste of money.;No flash is a huge deal
231;69.0;4.0;18.0;"Steve Jobs described the iPad as a magical and revolutionary device at the Apple press event that launched the product. So, as an owner of the device, would I also consider it ""magical"" and ""revolutionary""?\n\nWell, I don't know about magical as I generally reserve that for unicorns and the like. I've logged several hours on the device since launch day to give you a well-rounded account of the great, the not so great, and hopefully help you know if the iPad is right for you!\n\n--Overview:\n\nI really love my iPad. Like many, my first impression was that it was just a giant iPod Touch. I've come to realize that's not the case. In fact, it's so much more useful than an iPod Touch, I just chuckle these days when people say this. For me, the applications, utilization of the extra space, and the web capabilities that really won me over. There are a few features I'm really hoping are forthcoming in a future software build that would make the device even more useful. On the whole, the iPad has become an extremely useful device that's got my laptop feeling a bit unloved and jealous these days.\n\n--Hardware:\n\nThere's no denying the iPad is gorgeous. Apple has re-envisioned the beautiful look of the iPod Touch/iPhone in a fuller form. The screen is flawless and (as I unfortunately learned) very resistant to scratching. If you intend to use the device outdoors you'll want to know that the high-gloss on the screen makes it very difficult to see in direct sunlight at times. The speaker and mic are great in this device. The speaker will fill an entire room with sound. Unfortunately, Apple (yet again) put a focus on design over ergonomic. The iPad is a bit hefty, and a bit difficult to hold for long periods of time. It is; however, much sturdier than you might expect from the pictures.\n\nThe processor works extremely well with the iPhone OS, it's a screaming combination that makes this one of the fastest tablet computers I've used in ages. That being said, much of the software is designed for the less powerful iPhone still. We'll see how the iPad's speed stands up to a new wave of software designed for 1GHz mobile processors soon enough. Initially; however, it's been unimaginably quick.\n\nBattery life is amazing. I'm getting at least 8 hours (even watching video) and sometimes more. I also opted for the 64GB version of the iPad. It has plenty of storage for what I've been using the device for, but as my video collection becomes progressively more High Definition, it won't be long before I have to start picking and choosing what I can place on my iPad. This is not something I'm happy about in a device costing $699 + Tax that's so clearly designed for HD video and content. I'm also very disappointed in Apple's decision to not include an SD card reader for the device. This is one area where the HP slate still has a compelling advantage. There are many instances in which, popping in an SD card and being able to access the documents, images, music, and video stored on it would be extremely nice. Apple has planned an accessory for the iPad which will allow you to port your photos to it via an SD card adapter, but that's the extent of its functionality with SD cards. That's a definite delta for me.\n\nI have the Wi-Fi edition as the 3G version has not been released yet. I've run into a few instances where it would have been extremely nice to have 3G connectivity. If I had to make the choice over again, I think I would question my decision that everywhere I go has Wi-Fi anyway, and probably wait for the 3G edition. I'd really encourage you to hold out if you think there's any way in which you'd use the iPad regularly outside of Wi-Fi coverage.\n\nJust a quick note, I've had none of the issues that other users have reported with wireless connectivity. My iPad has been drama-free thus far. I'll update this review as I encounter issues to keep you aware.\n\n--Web Browsing & Email\n\nTwo of the iPad's strongest features are web browsing and email. Safari (the iPhone OS' native browser) is very fast. It's a significantly better browsing experience on the iPad than you'll have on the iPhone. I've found that I really don't use apps for sites like Facebook anymore. The iPad's screen makes it much easier to just visit the actual Facebook site.\n\nEven on the iPhone, email has never been so quick and simple. Apple really devised a great approach to email. A quick tap calls up a pain showing you all the emails in your inbox with a brief preview. You can organize, clear, or open email in ways that seem decades ahead of what MS Outlook is capable of. Setting up my Corporate Exchange account on the iPad took less than 60 seconds! It's hard to express what makes email so much better on the iPad than the iPhone/iPod Touch, but you'll know it when you see it.\n\n--The Applications\n\nThe applications really sold me on the iPad. I can't say enough about the iWork suite (sold separately via the App Store)! This software suite puts a desktop-grade word processing application and presentation software on your iPad. The ""Numbers"" spreadsheet application isn't exactly as smooth, but is still the best spreadsheet app available on a mobile platform. There are just so many great applications already available for the iPad that I can't list them all. My favorites so far are iWork Suite, Sketchbook Pro, Kindle for iPad, ABC Player, and Marvel Comics App. The extra screen real estate makes this device unquestionably better for media. Even the iPod application within the iPad is much smoother than on other iPhone OS devices. The iPad will also run your iPhone applications, and can double their size to help them fill more of the gigantic screen. Honestly, the iPhone applications aren't much of a selling point on this device. They look grainy and ridiculous on the iPad's screen.\n\n--iBook Store/Reader\n\nThe iPad does several things well. One it doesn't do well would be eBooks. The backlit screen is tough on the eyes and the resolution leaves the characters fuzzy. As a Kindle owner, I can honestly say that the iPad is not a replacement for that device. This is pretty much universally true of the eReader applications available for the iPhone/iPad. It may be personal preference but I really don't enjoy more than brief periods of reading on backlit screens. There's a reason 700 page novels aren't backlit = ).\n\n--I really wish it had...\n\nI really wish Apple would reconsider their stance on Adobe Flash. The absence of the key internet video technology makes the internet a little hit or miss. You'll still have a great YouTube option via the iPad's YouTube app, but little embedded videos on places like the NYT, MSNBC, or other sites are just not there at this point. Let's hope that Adobe and Apple either make up soon or HTML5 catches on extremely fast! Until then, the HP Slate may be a better option for users who really take advantage of web video other than YouTube.\n\nA camera would also be really nice, especially a front-facing camera for video conferencing. In a dock the iPad seems almost born to video conference! I doubt I'd be taking many pictures with my iPad if it included just a standard back-mounted camera, but it might help developers do more in their applications.\n\n--The Accessories:\n\nThe iPad uses the same (30-pin) style connector as the iPhone/iPod so it already has a wealth of compatible accessories on the market. If you own an iPhone/iPod, it may even be compatible with devices you already own. Here's the rule of thumb: If you have to dock the iPhone/iPod Touch... the iPad won't be compatible, if you can connect it via a cable, it'll work. This is mostly due to the considerable size of the iPad. Obviously, it's not going to fit in that smaller indentation that most iPhone/iPod docks utilize.\n\nI really recommend a case, and dock for this beast. I've owned my iPhone for 3 years and never owned a case for it (until a few weeks ago). I got away with that just fine. The larger screen of the iPad makes it a different sort of device; however, and I wouldn't even think of running around without a case on this thing. It's actually a bit disappointing that Apple didn't include one. I'm sort of glad they didn't; however, because I purchased the iPad case designed by Apple and was extremely disappointed. It's of a very weak felt lined cardboard from what I can tell. Its material holds oil and lint making the screen worse when you close the case. It also has such a tight grip on the device that putting the iPad in or taking it out of the case makes you feel like you might damage it.\n\nThe iPad really needs a dock! You wouldn't really anticipate it, but having this giant on your counter can really occupy much of your kitchen or desk space. I'd recommend a dock as they generally hold the device upright maximizing the space around it. Apple makes a really great dock for the device that includes an audio-out port. Just note, that the case designed by Apple isn't compatible with the dock. Go figure.\n\nIf you intend to carry a lot of video on the device, you may also want to invest in a video-out cable. The solutions available for the iPhone/iPod Touch will work for the iPad, or you can opt for the Apple video out cables (they actually aren't too horrible price-wise).\n\n--A note about iPhone OS 4:\n\nApple announced the newest edition of the iPhone operating system (which the iPad runs on) last week. Some really great features are on their way that will benefit the iPad a great deal! Amongst the best of them- multi-tasking (run multiple applications or processes at once), geotagging, improvements to gaming on the device, and more! Read up on the new OS! It should be available for the iPad later this year.\n\nThanks for reading my review! I hope it helped. If you do decide to purchase an iPad, have fun. It's a great device, and don't forget to try out the Sketchbook Pro, and iWork apps. I really love them on mine!";Considering the iPad
233;70.0;1.0;18.0;Well its like (exactly like really) the i phone...bigger screen is the only difference.

95;71.0;3.0;17.0;Hi there! I have just recently received an ipad, and for the most part, it is absolutely useless, for me at least.\n\nLet me tell you a bit of my background, I am a college student with a part time job. I have a powerful desktop and a semi-powerful laptop. My laptop has about 9-11 hours of battery life (asus ul30vt, $600). It also have 2 graphics card, 1 for hardcore gaming, and 1 for power saving, very intuitive. I also own a Mytouch Slide smartphone. My computer background is slightly advanced. Below is some aspects important to me (college student).\n\nGeneral Use:\nThe Ipad is for the most part useless to me. My laptop is only $100 more expensive, but much more useful, and it only weighs 3 pounds, with about the same battery life. I'm not trying to advertise for Asus, but just comparing laptops to this ipad. At home, I use my desktop most often. At school and work, I use my laptop for notetaking and serious work. On the bus, I use my smartphone for various stuff. The only time I find myself using the ipad is when I am in the bathroom taking a dump, or on bed watching videos (early morning or late at night when I am too lazy to get out of bed). It actually works fairly good on bed because it doesn't overheat, it is always cool. My laptop always makes my blanket too hot after a while.\n\nBattery:\nIf the ipad came 2 years ago, it would definitely be the best gadget ever because of the insane 10 hour battery life, but nowadays, many netbooks and laptops offer that amount for much less.\n\nGaming:\nI find the games on the ipad fairly dull as I am much into hardcore games like Halo, COD, starcraft, etc.\n\nUse-ability\nMostly everything the ipad can do, including ebooks, I can do on my laptop. The pros of the ipad can be experienced for novice to casual computer users. The ipad OS is very simple and clean. It's also very smooth. However for my generation, computer is a very big part of our lives.\n\nApps:\nBecause of all the apps, the ipad can be used for a lot of different things. However...you have to have the money. Yes you can jailbreak it, but that's the same as stealing.\n\nKeyboard:\nSpeaking of which. The ipad keyboard is not bad. However, to type correctly with minimum error, you have to look at the keyboard because you can't touch type with the virtual keyboard, and also you have to lift you palm away from the keybaord because the slightest touch can make a letter click. The auto correction system is OK, not great.\n\nPortability:\nThe ipad is only 1.5 pounds, but it is as big as a netbook. Which means, I will have to bring a bag or backpack. May be useful if you carry a medium sized purse that you can fit an ipad in (but this is for college review).\n\nPrice:\nI got my ipad used (mint condition, 16gb wifi) for $400. You can get a brand new 16gb wifi for $450 on Craigslist fairly easily. It is NOT WORTH it to buy a 32 or 64gb version because Apple overpriced the upgrade. I mean...come on, $100 for such a small upgrade? no wonder they don't offer removable memory, so that they can force people to buy the bigger memory. Also a 3G chip shouldn't cost $130 to upgrade.\n\nPerformance:\nThe OS is very smooth, but I did find some lag. A few times it just froze, it wouldn't register any of my touches.\n\nMultitasking:\nsimply doesn't have it, should wait for the 4.2 upgrade. I use AIM for instant messaging, and if I press the home button, it exits out of AIM. It doesn't sign me off immediately, but it also doesn't tell me if I received a new IM or not. I have to go back into AIM to see if anyone replied.\n\nSocial:\nFor the most part, college students will view you as an Apple fanboy, which is NOT a good thing. For our generation, we tend to favor variety. Apple products in general are very strict and linear.\n\nPeople who may want to buy an ipad:\n1. don't have a long battery life laptop or netbook\n2. not technologically experienced, casual users\n3. casual gamers.\n4. all about the apps (if you can afford it).\n5. travel alot.\n6. Have the money.\n7. don't need multitasking.\n\nPeople who will regret buying an ipad:\n1. have a all-around laptop with great battery life\n2. no empty niche for ipad\n3. hardcore gamer\n4. touch-typist\n5. Video chatting is a norm\n\nThis is just what I feel. 3 stars because it is an OK product. Yes it is smooth and very nice to hold, but not really what I need, or even want. I am looking to sell my ipad because it doesn't fit any niche in my life. However, like I said, the ipad will be perfect for people who needs an extremely portable device with great battery life. But then again, you can always buy the Asus 1005pe netbook (12 hours of battery) for about $280. or my Asus UL series for about $600. (yes i LOVE asus, they are the best laptop/netbook company, check them out, much better than HP, Toshiba, Gateway, Acer). The one thing that is incomparable with the ipad is its multitouch and smoothness. However, come 2011, the ipad should have a lot of competitors coming out.\n\n-College Student 101;Important aspects to a College Student
28;72.0;1.0;16.0;I love the product, but it's the pricing that I'm grading on. Why are these vendors selling for so much when Apple's website has this listed for just $[...] plus free shipping? Usually you can get good deals on Amazon, but the sellers for this product are charging almost twice as much and for a first generation product that's already been replaced by a new version.;Why so overpriced?
159;73.0;4.0;17.0;You are either going to pick this up and love it, or pick it up and wonder what the heck it is.\n\nFor me this is a great product. If you have an iphone or an ipod touch you know how to use it, it really is just bigger. Although it's faster and easier to use because the keyboard is larger and there is more screen area to use for applications. i bought the Wifi model initially and loved it then upgraded to the 3G as it allowed me to provide remote support anywhere I went. I put my movies, music, games, RSS readers on it and never looked back. The iPad truly is a great device. I imagine that there may be other brand coming out but in today's marketplace the iPad is the best portable computer I have seen.\n\nSome people say that it has flaws, I have only run into one website that I frequently use that didn't work, and that was CNN. All other sites I visit have changed their video formats over to html5 or other ipad friendly formats. Flash not running on here is really not a big deal for my applications.\n\nThis makes a fantastic book reader as well. I've actually read more in the last few weeks with this then I had in the last few years. It makes reading so accessible because no matter where you are if you have a few minutes you can pull up a book, read a chapter and then move on without having to carry a book around.\n\nThis is a fantastic product, I can't say enough about it. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because it's a bit heavy, and that's the only reason. But if you consider the battery life in my experience has easily been 10-14 hours without a charge you realize that's why it's heavy. It is so nice being able to have a computer that you can literally use all day without having to turn features off to try to save battery and still not be able to exhaust the battery.\n\nGreat product.;This is an amazing product
207;74.0;5.0;17.0;"Great device. Does exactly as advertised and more.\nWhat I love:\n1. Video\nNetflix, ABC, iTune transfered movies, and an amazing app called AirVideo that allows me to play video from my iMac or PC directly on my iPad without transferring it to my iPad.\nStunning smooth video, no complaints.\n2. email\nI've got 7 email accounts on this thing and it functions flawlessly.\n3. Internet browsing\nI'm very happy with the browser, especially the speed and finger gestures. It's intuitive and fast.\n4. Work apps\nI'm an IT admin and this thing is a great tool for admins like me.\nVPN is built in.\nVNC and RDP function nicely for remote access to my work environment.\nDropbox keeps my files synced.\nAnd a little app called TeamViewer lets me fix my family members computers remotely.\n5. Planning and keeping track of my daily activities is easier with the multitude of To-Do apps, calendar, and Notes Pro app.  Everything is in one place.\n6. Kindle/iBooks are great. Super convenient in a way that's got me reading books again.\n7. KAYAK Flights is a fantastic app to check flight pricing whenever I want.\n8. Keeping up with the latest news on USA Today, SCI FI Wire, TUAW, DVICE, Ingadget, as well as Twitter, Woot, eBay, Newegg, and Craigslist couldn't be more convenient.\n9. Blogging, Cooking, weather, games, music on Pandora, movie times, tv guides, Yellow and White pages, writing pad (handwriting recognition), millage tracker, etc are just a few of the ""useless"" apps people complain about and I use every day.\n\nAs far as the iPad shortcomings, we all knew what they were before it came out.  So why buy it if it's not what you want?\n\nI'm good with no camera.  I've got a camera on my iMac and video calls are uncomfortable and unnecessary.  Why would I want it on my iPad?\n\nPeople complaining about the lack of high-def video-out kill me.  It's a portable device, not a 50 inch plasma screen!  Use it for what it's intended for and get over it.\n\nLack of Flash can be annoying, but that shortcoming wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I don't miss it.\n\nI own a netbook. It's been sitting on my desk for months, unused. Video stutters, internet is difficult to use, audio is terrible, battery life is weak.  And that's after upgrading to 2gb of memory.\nIn other word, it's not better than my iPad and I'm selling it.\n\nThe biggest plus of my iPad is convenience.  It's always on and ready.  I rarely use my computers anymore.\n\nSo, if you do some due diligence and actually find out what an iPad does, you should be able to make an educated decision on whether it's for you or not.\n\nI don't believe a windows based tablet can come close to functioning as nicely as an iPad. An Android tablet might.\n\nI don't think I'm the only one happy with these, close to 1 million have been sold.  And that's before the 3G models have hit the shelves or sales outside the US have started.\n\nYa, Steve Jobs really messed up with the iPad.  Guess the stock holders should get rid of him before Apple stock hits 300 and makes them more money than they can count...";Unlike the Trolls, I really did buy an iPad
224;75.0;5.0;17.0;My 8 year old son has autism. His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking. This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him. So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son. He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him. He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting. There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.\n\nOne con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.\n\nWe are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (neither of which are covered by insurance). We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle. But this is just the thing for us.\n\nMy other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad. I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything. I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device. (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).\n\nFor those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc. Then don't buy it. But you won't convince me. I've been using my son's - and now I want my own! Books, email, etc. I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids. Last night I was playing Monopoly with my daughter on the family room floor while tracking some of these packages that I'm expecting. Also, there are apps that I can download which I haven't even explored yet.;Great for my son with autism
69;76.0;3.0;16.0;"After receiving an unexpected bonus from my employer I decided to use it to pick up an iPad.  I went with the 16 gig wifi only model as I didn't want to shell a lot out of pocket and the bonus barely covered the cost.  While I like the device from a ""coolness"" perspective, I have found that over the past month of use that the lack of flash support makes the device nearly useless for effective web surfing.  I would estimate that nearly 80 to 90 percent of run of the mill sites use some form of flash that makes them crippled on the iPad.  Try going to any of the national chain restaurant websites, (fFriday's, Chilis, Applebees, Buffalo Wild Wings) and it's likely that you'll end up not being able to view much if anything.  Many sports news sites or general new sites have huge holes in their pages where flash is supposed to be running.  Even with all the other nice bells and whistles, and the hundreds of thousands of apps available, this one drawback makes it tough for me to recommend the iPad to someone who expects a full web browsing experience from a portable tablet based device.  As for use as a laptop replacement for business purposes, the options in the app store for MS Office compatible software for editing word, excel and PowerPoint docs are quote broad, but not a single one let's you edit in any form that is close to the full blown desktop software, especially PowerPoint which I use extensively.  Logmein Ignition picks up the slack however in giving me access to my work laptop when I am away, albeit it's tough sometimes positioning the mouse on the laptop's screen accurately.  It will allow me though to leave my laptop at home on short business trips as long as I have wifi where I am.  I am going to add on a MiFi hotspur from one of the major carriers to allow me access anywhere rather than having gotten the 3G version, which allows me to pick the vendor of choice and upgrade to 4g or whatever newer technology comes out.  The lack of cameras is glaring considering all android based devices are seemingly coming out with them in their first gen offerings.  My hope is that e next gen iPads have dual cameras to support FaceTime and other video chatting software.  I also hope they work something out with adobe so that flash support comes to the iPad.  Without it, I am definitely leaning towards an android based device as an ""upgrade"" from the iPad because viewing the web is to me what these devices are supposed to do well and the iPad falls way short of acceptable.";Lack of flash support really starts to annoy after a while
143;77.0;5.0;16.0;I was a skeptic about the iPad, but after playing around with one at the Apple Store, I decided to give it a shot.  Like the iPod, I have used it more than I thought and I especially love it for traveling.  It's important for me to be able to get online when needed.\n\nWith more and more applications being web-based, I'd found that I have just about all I need right out of the box.  A few additions, like a password management program I found via iTunes, and I was good to go.\n\nTyping is easier than I expected.  It's good for a quick trip, where I just have to check email or bank account stuff.  That's mostly what I use this for.  If you are a hardcore computer person, your results may vary.\n\nThings I like about it:\n\n- not having to pack a huge laptop when I travel\n- reading books and newspapers\n- the simple, ipod-like games are a nice diversion\n- being able to stay connected while living my life away from the computer;great for traveling
234;78.0;5.0;16.0;"I had a chance to try one of these at a store for about half an hour - so I'm not at all an expert, but thought I'd share some quick thoughts for what they're worth.  I can't claim to ""need"" this yet, and will probably wait at least until the OS upgrade, but I've gone from being unconvinced to eager.  A little while with one of these was enough to show me it has huge potential, both for home use and in the classroom.  To all the haters and nay-sayers, I say: try one.\n\nIt's smaller than I expected.  At first blush it feels like an oversized iPod Touch, but once you get to using it, that impression goes away quickly.  It has the same intuitive feel, and the interaction with the screen is so light and obvious. I didn't really have to think about what to do; my fingers knew (or, rather, the designers knew what my fingers would find out quickly). It's large enough, though, I found there are whole new layers of possible interaction.  Books, obviously - and the way they turn pages, the way they incorporate available graphics, and the possibilities for making them interactive make this device a real game changer. What I like is that it's so much more than just a reader.  Movies, browsing, organizing.  I wouldn't compose documents here, likely, but I think it would be perfect for editing and reading through drafts.  Games, too. I played Poptropica's ""Plants vs. Zombies"" and was surprised by how much more fun it is to actually point to and touch what you want to do, rather than manipulate a pointer from a trackpad or a mouse.\n\nIt's more than an oversized Touch; but it doesn't quite feel like a small laptop.  It's a different kind of thing, and that's a good thing.  It's more mobile and, in a word, handier.  Sometimes I just want to check something, look something up, browse.  This would be exactly the thing.  Sometimes I want to relax and recline.  If you've ever tried reclining with a laptop, curling up in bed with a laptop ... it doesn't really work.  You have to put your hands all awkward to interact with laptops lying down.  They're made for sitting up straight - and are only passably workable for short stretches on the lap or in front of you while lying down on the stomach -- they work best at a desk.  More than that, for some uses the keyboard just gets in the way.  Interacting directly with the screen is a dream.  I rarely like to watch movies on my laptop, and an iPod Touch or an iPhone is really too small to enjoy, but watching an iPad and interacting with it through touch, is quite a delight.  I can definitely imagine curling up with this.";A whole new kind of thing - a beautiful device, with so-far-untapped possibilities
51;79.0;1.0;15.0;"this iPad is a piece of JUNK with so many issues that you can praise Apple for their marketing hype that makes the lousiest product look like a hot one !!!\nMy brother-in-law works at Apple, and even at Apple they don't allow staff to talk about bugs, issues and customer complaints about the ipad.\n\nAnyway, you might want to read reviews about it before spending $500 and up on an ipad, especially with the new Android tablets coming up soon with Honeycomb.\n\nHere is a summary of issues with the iPad (most are reported here):\n- you cannot print anything from it. period. not even your e-ticket confirmation. plain dumb !\n- no real multitasking, even their ""fix"" is not a real multitasking, but good enough for the masses\n- you cannot watch Flash-enabled sites. this includes numerous e-learning sites and most video and games on the Internet.\n- problematic WiFi support. Apple did it again, even with their wireless access point. Don't expect to use that in a hotel with WiFi. At least 2/3 don't work with there!\n- impossible to synchronize to a PC that does not have an Intel chip. good luck on that one, since you MUST at least synchronize it once!\n- no camera, whether front facing or rear facing\n- no USB ports,\n- no easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy,\n- no easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office),\n- on-screen keyboard is not practical, if you need to type a bit, use a REAL laptop\n- screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars,\n- there is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD,\n- no SD or other card readers for your photos,\n- screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors,\n- ridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)\n- very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)\n- much pricier than alternative tablets like Archos with way more features and openness\n- you cannot change the browser for a better one. remember Apple is a closed system\n- expensive data plans if you use 3G\n- no support for email attachments. feels like back in the 1990's.\n- to watch movies from your PC, you have to download a video converter, or buy them from iTunes\n- Air Video (which enables you to watch videos you have loaded into iTunes) only works with a few routers, and notably not with any AT&T Routers at all\n- no tethering to anything\n- no common laptop/netboook features: security software, voice recorder, or calculator\n- extraordinarily fragile device, do not drop it on your carpet, it WILL break.\n- heavier than you think. You won't be able to hold it in your hand for long.\n- cannot rest flat on a table or your lap, you will block the WiFi antenna behind the Apple logo and weaken your WiFi signal.\n\nAnd finally, to do anything you need on the iPad, you still need to connect it regularly to a PC or a Mac. You have to connect in order to sync up your latest podcasts and media files. You need to sync to get OS updates. You need to sync in order to get your latest business documents on the iPad.\n\nNow you can make your own informed decision about buying an iPad or not, and if you got one already, you can understand better why you can't do certain things that you could do on a normal laptop.";An expensive piece of junk from Apple, the specialist in marketing hype

For summary judgment skip to the very bottom.  I'll add a video review once I get settled.\n\nI bought an iPad just so I could review it.  Figuring that it would be one of the more popular reviews out there, I decided that it would be in my best interest to take the time to run it through its paces.  And you know what I've discovered?  It really IS an oversized iPod Touch.  No, I'm serious - right down to the functionality within, the navigation, even the Settings menu, it's clear that they took the iPod Touch (or rather, the iPhone OS) and tweaked a few settings, enlarged some others, and slapped it onto a form factor reminiscent of, as one person put it, an iPod Touch ran over by a steamroller.  For crying out loud, the iPad even runs iPod Touch and iPhone apps in their native resolutions, it's like looking at the apps on those devices!\n\nBut, I digress.  The first thing that I noticed about this device was the fact that everyone seemed to want it, yet really didn't know why.  I and a colleague spent weeks trying to identify a single use case for the iPad; I even went out on a limb long before I laid hands on one and said that the iPad is effectively a toy.  Now that I've used it, that's exactly what it is: a toy.  It's not for those who want to get things done.  It's for those who want a pastime.  Now mind you, there's nothing wrong with that - but that's a fact.  I also like to say that it's a jack of all trades yet master of none, which is also a factual statement.\n\nNext thing I noticed was the blatantly excessive setup steps which are more the fault of iTunes than the iPad.  See, if you're a MacBook owner, you're asked to sign up for iTunes when you first set up the laptop.  That's the same process for any Apple device that runs iTunes even if you don't plan on using it on a regular basis.  The problem is that iTunes is not smart enough to detect and merge duplicate accounts.  Obviously, if I've got two accounts with the same email address, it's probably a good bet that they belong to the same person unless the name is different, which it isn't.  iTunes registered my email address from when I owned an iPod Touch, yet used my username from my MacBook, even though the email address is the exact same.  The problem is that iTunes attaches your download history to the username, not to the email address.  This wouldn't otherwise be an issue, but for the fact that you can't even start using the iPad until you attach it to a Mac and connect via iTunes to activate it.  The problem is the account that it uses to do said activation vs. the account that has the stuff you wanted.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going.\n\n- I had bought a number of apps on the iPod Touch, and thought I could download them again at any time (email address);\n- I had created a number of podcasts on the MacBook (username, or so I thought);\n- I tried to get iBooks, Kindle, Amazon Mobile and Netflix on the iPad along with all of the above (email address, or so I thought).\n\nFirst the iPad wouldn't sync properly.  It gave me a list of everything (both from the email address and the username) but wouldn't download content from either.  Then it told me to activate the MacBook for access to the apps.  Did that, and tried again.  The iPad still wouldn't sync the apps.  I tried to download them directly from the iPad; it attempted a download, then sat there.  I had to clear out the iTunes account on the iPad (which was the username), log out of iTunes on the MacBook (which was the username), then log back into both with the email address, which then allowed me to get the apps, though slow.  But then I couldn't get the podcasts or some music I had bought.  Had to repeat and log in with the username to get those to sync.  After much futzing I got everything set up - 2 hours of my life wasted to set up.  Probably not an issue if you'd never owned a MacBook or an iPod or an iPhone or anything like that.  Basically, if you'd never used iTunes it would probably go smoother as you'd not have anything to transfer.\n\nLet's get down to it, shall we?  I approach this review in terms of use case, so for you, find the use case that applies, and see if the statement is enough to deter (or encourage) you.\n\nMy first thought:\n\n- THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT DEVICE TO HAVE AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE PLANE, AT THE HOTEL, ETC!\n\n...this was hard to debunk, but I managed to do it.  First of all, it IS a fun device for those places, but the limitations hold it back from the greatness that it could have been if it were to have a full flavor of Snow Leopard rather than an iPhone OS derivative.  Let me explain:  Most important, the device is too heavy to be carried and held for extended periods.  Because the entire back is aluminum, and because the screen is so thick, nevermind the battery, it doesn't lend itself to being held for a long time.  Yes, I know there are docks.  But if you're going to just dock the thing you might as well bring the laptop along.  Additionally, there were minor issues with the WiFi - I didn't have the ""refuse to reconnect"" issue.  What I experienced was unusual slowness from two different hotspots: my Mobile Hotspot, and my home wireless.  My Mobile Hotspot has run GoToMeetings.  It's not a slouch.  Yet, for some reason, iTunes struggled to open and was unbearably slow, as was Kindle.  Yet, on a netbook that I recently sold, on the same hotspot, Kindle was reasonably quick and snappy.  I know why there was a difference...the apps on the iPad are very graphics-rich and it's clear that it wants at least medium (3Mbps down) speeds on the WiFi for an optimal experience.  It works, but it's just not fun to wait 20 minutes for a book to download, I mean really.\n\nMy next thought (initiated by a co-worker):\n\n- THIS COULD BE A GREAT DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING DOCUMENTS TO CO-WORKERS!!\n\n...except for one small problem: interacting with Microsoft networks is nigh impossible, and file management is non-existent.  The only way to get a file on the device is to have it emailed to you or otherwise sent through MobileMe or iTunes.  If the data is sensitive there's no way to get it securely to your device (unless you have secure email screening services), since the iPad does not have any exterior ports for storage devices.  What's worse, since it's not running Snow Leopard, it means no VMWare, no Office 2008, no Office Online.  As much as some would hate to admit it, Microsoft Office dominates the workspace, and if a device cannot interact with those documents, it makes it hard to justify.  Even if the device can do other things, it's yet another (heavy) device to carry along with the user's regular computer/books/etc.\n\nMy next thought (initiated by a co-worker):\n\n- COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!\n\n...I did read the Seton Hall announcement about giving all of their students iPads and MacBook Pros.  It must be nice to have so much money to throw around - and I suspect they're taking it out of the loans that the students are ponying up to attend, but I'm guessing that this one depends.  I mean, on one hand, yes, the convenience of being able to pull out a device and research something really quick might be a boon.  It also might be convenient to be able to listen to broadcasts or see webinars that have been posted on iTunes.  On the other hand, some colleges might not care much for the potential cheating that the iPad seems to encourage by its open access.  Of course, ""guns don't kill people"", but you see what I'm getting at.\n\nMy next thought:\n\n- WOW!! A COLOR TABLET EREADER!!\n\n...and yes, it is this, and does it fairly well, but then you run into the problem of cost-benefit.  Some would justify it by saying ""yeah, but it can do other things!!"" which is true, but I don't look at it that way; if all I wanted to do is read books, I would get an eReader (I actually bought a Kindle a while ago.  Great device).  In order for me to justify a purchase, it has to be spot on with what I intend to use it for.  If I can't find a viable use case, I can't justify its price.  In truth, I couldn't justify buying it this time, but for the need to actually review it and attempt to help others with my experience.  But back on topic, the big issue with the reader is threefold: first, iBooks is terrible.  It screams ""gimmick"" from the moment you launch your first book.  Looks extremely well made, but there were some bad framerate issues when flipping pages, and I found myself wishing I could disable the animation.  Then there was Kindle, which thankfully didn't have the page flip animation, and what's more, Kindle showed how much more evolved it was than iBooks by virtue of it giving you freebie books and userguides along with the software, unlike iBooks which let you stare at a blank bookshelf.  The second thing to decide is whether or not the backlit LCD works for you.  Some are sensitive to it and prefer the eInk display.  I'll tell you this much - if you're trying to read outdoors, the iPad automatically loses!  It also loses in battery life AND multitasking, believe it or not ( the Kindle allows you to play music while reading while still managing to pull out days of use without the need to recharge ).\n\nSo on and so forth...try as I might, I could not find a viable use case for the iPad.  It does so much and yet so little.  It's a very specific market that could truly benefit, but at that narrow of a market target, the price is a bit steep.  It's not way out there on this model, but definitely on the 3Gs.\n\nIn other words readers:\n\n-=- What the iPad does RIGHT -=-\n\n- Convenience.  Powers on quick, ready to use at your beckon call.\n- Navigation is smooth, no real hickups on the interface that I could tell.\n- Tight integration with iTunes allows you to get books, magazines, movies, trailers, games, etc. at the push of a few buttons.\n- Decent speaker volume for watching movies or trailers, even has an equalizer to adjust the output quality.\n- The screen is brilliant and vibrant and easy on the eyes (but see WRONG below).\n- The 16GB model isn't that overpriced considering the technology (Which has been measured to cost about $250 to make).\n\n-=- What the iPad does WRONG -=-\n\n- Weight.  It's a heavy device, a VERY heavy device not meant to be held for long periods of time.\n- Glossy screen - just like the MacBook Pros, they just don't believe in matte or at least polarized screens; this thing is a straight up mirror in broad daylight.  Might consider an overlay.\n- No external ports i.e. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB, etc.  Yes, there's a dock port, but you know what I mean.  A DisplayPort would not have hurt Apple.\n- Initial setup is cumbersome if you are trying to add all of your previously purchased content.\n- iPhone/iPod Touch apps are stretched with no optimization or smoothing.\n- Because it's based on iPhone OS and not Snow Leopard, or at least a slimmer version thereof, it's extremely limited in productivity; not quite feasible for a workplace replacement device.\n- WiFi seems extremely slow; there are reports of WiFi issues across the web, so it may be an antenna problem with the first gens.  As we all know, Apple likes to use first adopters as guinea pigs and then release the good stuff later.\n- It truly IS an oversized iPod Touch.  The look, the feel, the navigation, the limitations, all are identical to those found on the Touch.  The only difference is the larger screen, which for some is more than sufficient, but I consider this a negative, because it doesn't stand apart much from the Touch, and it should.\n\nSo...in summary, do I recommend it?  Well...depends.  The answer is an emphatic ""NO"" if you're looking for something to replace your PC entirely.  It's not happening.  It's a soft ""YES"" if you accept that the device is a fun add-on that is not going to replace anything - something to pass time, or accompany you on your travel or something.  As long as you are ok with that then it won't disappoint you.  But don't expect a laptop out of this thing.";"Best quote ever: ""A solution in search of a problem""."

For me, that's simply critical for any business or home use.  It makes it essentially useless with clients and at work.  Overall, I'm guessing it costs me almost 60% of the potential functionality\n\nNot to mention it makes it useless with a motel tv when traveling and trying to use a streaming video provider like netflix..  Most video services - in fact most applications - don't work at all - only a very few apple apps.\n\nThis is embarrassing. My iPad may go back unless Apple can fix this with software pretty darned quickly.\n\nWe have two 17"" macBookPros, iPhones, iPods, airPorts, etc. And this is the first Apple product we didn't love out of the box.";1 major flaw - no external video for viewing iPad screen or movies...
186;84.0;3.0;15.0;A few months ago some people said it was the laptop killer.  I just received my iPad a few days ago and I am somewhat disappointed.  This review is as a first few days impression and I have yet to unlock all the changes that the developers at Apple had to do from the ground up.  Let me start with the pros.\n\nPros:\n1. beautiful, and sleek display.  if you are accustomed to the iTouch or iPhone you will like the large display\n2. battery life says up to 9 hrs while surfing the web\n3. portable, slim, and light\n\nCons:\n1. so far it feels like really just a big iTouch or the same as the iphone minus texting and phone\n2. does not have the capabilities to attach photos or files in emails\n3. moving your fingers across a large screen is much more work than using a mouse\n4. no flash or java applets capabilities\n5. pay another $30 monthly for the data plan eventhough you already have an iPhone\n\nThough the iPhone remains my favorite device, the iPad will not kill the laptop anytime soon.  Once Apple figures out how to address the attach photos/files in emails, flash/java, and costly service data plan then it shall be given 3 stars.  Can I do without an iPad...yes...but having one around is more fun.;Revolutionary?

The apple iPad is truely the ""must have"" electronic for those of us on the go and even when we stay at home. I find that the built in speakers and the lack of a camera like its cousin, the iPod, a little irritating. That is the only reason for me not giving it a full five star rating. The sound is great when using earphones, ear buds or external speakers.  But the fact that there are over 200,000 apps, something for everyone, is incrediblle. I have the Wi-Fi only version which I use at home, hotels and Wi-Fi hotspots. I decided that the 3G AT&T monthly charges were a little to pricey for my pocket book. Watching videos and movies on the LED backlit screen is of great quality, beating even some of the HGTV's. I love the fact that depending on what you are doing, you can turn the iPad either horizontal or verticle. The keyboard is of good size, not like the tiny one on the iPod. I find that the 32GB flash drive is quite sufficant for me. I have approximatly 1200 songs, a couple of books and 3 or 4 movies stored on it with room left. This is a nice little 1.5lb bundle of joy.

52;86.0;2.0;14.0;"I was really drawn to to the iPad after playing with it at Best Buy. I had been waiting for a long time to see what kind of Android tablets would come out but finally gave up on hoping for one that would have the same responsive interface as the iPad and received one as an early Christmas present.\n\nI'm an art student and the thought was that I would be able to use the iPad to take quick color sketches and play video games on the go without toting my entire compliment of materials and a laptop around. In theory it seemed much better than any kind of tablet PC alternative since its small enough to go everywhere but big enough for me to see what I'm drawing. In practice though it really didn't work that well for drawing, even with top rated painting apps and a stylus. So lets break it down into pros and cons.\n\nPros\nportable- not as portable as an iphone but small enough that you can stick it in your backpack or purse and take it most places.\n\n3g- you're not likely to find a better deal for no-contract 3g service even with the 2 gb cap.\n\ninterface- lets not forget the sweet responsive interface, the primary reason that you're probably thinking about buying an iPad and the main thing that sets it apart from a netbook.\n\nReading- at least for reading an ebook, the iPad is much more comfortable to read on than a laptop or netbook. the page flipping animation as well helps to capture that. Though the advantages over an actual paper and ink ""book"" seem to be negligible. It can hold a large number of them, and really, how many books do you plan on reading in any given day anyway?\n\nGames- lots of fun games right at your fingertips, most of which are very inexpensive.\n\nCons\n\nGames - lots of drek right at your fingertips, most of which tricks you into wasting between 1 and 5 dollars on it.\n\nviewing angle- being flat, its really hard to see the thing and type or let it rest in your lap without some sort of stand or keyboard attachment. If you're going to get a keyboard attachment for it though... why not just get a netbook for half the price.\n\nfunctionality- the iPad certainly has all the pieces parts to be as capable, if not more so than a standard netbook but its locked down under the oppressive rule of itunes.  While many things are much easier and more streamlined than on a regular PC, other relatively mundane tasks, like transferring files or signing pdf forms, will have you endlessly trudging through the app store.  The phrase ""there's an app for that"" is truly a double edged sword.\n\nSHINY!! as appealing as the shiny surface is in photos, people will think you have some sort of condition when they see you bobbing around trying to peer around your own silhouette while trying to watch a movie on the thing.\n\ncost- this is a big one, at least for a student like me. The thing isn't cheap.  Realistically you can get a pretty good laptop for the cost of an iPad, even the cheapest 16 GB one, yet you can't get anywhere near the same level of functionality out of it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nI had one for 27 days, for the first 2 weeks it was the greatest, most useful device on the planet. The next week I complained about how my wrists hurt from holding the iPad up to play angry birds and. Then I converted a bunch of comics from cbr to cbz and then to epub for the iBooks app because the cbr reader app sucks. Then I just went back to regular ol' paper comics. On the 27'th day I realized Lenovo was having a year end sale on laptops and I could replace my defunct laptop with a core i7 machine for less than I paid for the iPad. Luckily Target has a 90 day return policy and let me take it back without even asking to keep the 15% restocking fee. I got cash for a present instead and spent it on something useful.\n\nKeep in mind, no matter how sexy it looks, its still a little computer and like every other computer it's going to p**s you off at some point.  If you MUST get one, get it from some place where it's easy to return, take it for a test drive. If you're like me and you find that it's beginning to spend a significant amount of time on the shelf, take it back. The thing is too expensive not to be using it absolutely every minute of every day for a full year. Tell them the WiFi doesn't work or something if they have a restocking fee.";A seductive device but not for everyone
75;87.0;5.0;14.0;"Sorry guys but after reading review after review of people bashing the iPad and having never actually owned or used one I had to write this. First off would I be considered a ""Apple Fanboy""? Well I guess if you consider the definition of the term I will say yes and I guess proud to be one. But I am going to give you the good the bad and the ugly without bashing the product.\n\nThe Good:\n1. This is a tablet device that is easy to carry when you don't need the full power of a PC/Mac.\n2. The instant I saw this I Knew in that it had it uses in my field of work. I am a electronics tech contractor for the military and I work on equipment on trucks all day outside. If I tried to use a netbook( Which I have tried) to do the task of inventory and maintenance tracking while in the field the netbook would be trash in no time. This said the iPad isn't indestructible. If you use it like I do outside in a field environment buy the Defender series case from OtterBox, It is super tough and has a hard cover for the screen when its not being used.\n3. The apps are dirt cheap for the thing. I paid 9bucks for Apple Numbers (Spreadsheet app similar to Excel). That is way cheap for a functional spreadsheet app.\n4. I can use this for entertainment while traveling, which I do a ton of, without having to drag my laptop out of a bag and finding a place where the dust isn't going to gum up my keyboard.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. If you want a full fledged laptop this isn't it. It is a complementary device to the laptop.\n2. In order to take full advantage of the iPad you need a laptop or desktop to sync it with. You don't have to have it but your not going to be getting many movies or much music on it otherwise.\n3. People will bash you for using the Apple brand of devices...but only because they are jealous or ignorant. Not because they actually use them and know their strengths and weaknesses. There is a misconception that if you use it your a tree hugging yuppy or something...which I am not.\n4. More cords and adapters to carry if you already lug a laptop around.\n5. They are not cheap.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1. As soon as you decide to buy the iPad, know that next year Apple will come out with a better  and fancier product. They update products on a yearly cycle.\n2. Along with #1 that also means that when the newer iPad comes out that there will be functions you won't have and cant get without dropping more cash for a new one. You can only upgrade the software not the hardware.\n3. For those of you that like Flash games like Farmville, your SOL, the iPad does not support flash. Sorry.\n\nThats my short OPINION on the iPad. My closing thought are this, if you are looking for a simple device to get on the internet and do light duty work while away from the desktop/laptop then it MIGHT be for you. Also if you like diving off in folders and exploring the guts of the operating system then I suggest looking elsewhere. Apple makes products that a non tech savvy person can pick up and fell comfortable using. Heck even my wife, who hates computers, would kill me over her iPhone. Lastly if your not sure whether it is right for you, find someone that has one, go to a Apple store give it a spin and do some research online into whether it has what your looking for. I give it 5stars because it works for me. Later.";What the iPad is and isn't
79;88.0;1.0;14.0;"Spent 15 minutes in the store playing on this thing, trying to figure out why the hell I would want to buy this. I found myself awkwardly going through the ""features"" trying to find something to distinguish this product as something worth buying.\n\n It goes on the internet? Wow.  I've got at least 3 different devices that do that. It has a book? So what?  I have a Nook that does that. Even if I didn't, I'd sooner just buy a paperback than drop $600.\n\nI knew this product was useless when I handled it in the store, come to find out it's more useless than I thought.  Can't print?  It'd be bad enough if it were no different from a laptop.  Come to find out, it does LESS than most laptops and netbooks, but for more money.  Oh, and THIS IS NOT PORTABLE.  It's heavy.  I shortly tired of holding it and put it down.  This thing doesn't even do much more than my IPOD. At least you can throw the IPOD in a purse.  Even your laptop can go in your backpack without too many worries since the screen is enclosed.  Not the case with this item that has a fragile, glass screen with no protection.\n\nThis is a device for those tools who go to Starbucks to be seen writing their manuscript and have to ice their boners whenever Steve Jobs announces a new scam **cough** sorry, I meant ""product.""  A more discerning buyer will not purchase something so frivolous.";POINTLESS. STICK TO YOUR NETBOOK OR LAPTOP
88;89.0;5.0;14.0;"By way of background, I have never been a fan of Apple's closed ecosystem and forced use of iTunes, the iStore and App Store as the sole source of consumable content (not that we can't free the device with jailbreaking, but that's not for most people).  I haven't bought an apple product since the second generation ipod years ago.  I have also played quite a bit with android based phones and have been eagerly researching and awaiting the release of android based tablets.  After doing considerable research, I have come to the conclusion that android 2.2 (FroYo) is not ready for prime time use on tablet after having some play time with a Samsung Galaxy tab.  Apps have to be scaled up, which makes them look rather blocky and atari 2600 on the Samsung's 7"" 1024x600  resolution screen.  This problem is further exacerbated on larger size screens like the demo I saw of the Archos 101 (10.1"" with a 1024x600 resolution).  At some point in the not to distant future, app developers will release modified versions of their apps suited to higher resolution/larger size screens.  At the moment, froyo tops out at 854x480 resolution, which will cripple the ability of developers to rescale their apps until either Gingerbread or Honeycomb are released by Google (who has yet to confirm which update will actually allow android to accomodate higher resolution displays).  Don't get me wrong, the hardware on the Galaxy Tab, Archos 101 and Viewsonic G Tablet (this tab in particular) are all quite good--better than the iPad--but without the OS and the Apps, the hardware really doesn't do the user much good.\n\nRather than wait the 6 months to a year before the Android guys get their acts together, I decided to go online and find myself a used 64gb iPad on ebay.  I did this reluctantly, but I wanted to give apple products another try.  The iPad was purchased for about $120 less than I would pay for the same product from Apple.  I did notice that there was a burn in the LCD which caused part of the screen to show up white when the rest of the screen was black.  I have seen this type of defect before and it is a manufacturer's defect that should entitle me to a replacement device.  I registered myself as the user of the iPad and brought my ""new"" used iPad to the Apple store.  They looked at the issue and 15 minutes later, I walked out of the Apple Store with a brand new iPad under my arm.  Now that's what I call customer service!!!!  Steve Jobs scored lots of points on that.\n\nI brought the iPad home, loaded iTunes onto my Dell (again no Apples) and in ten minutes I had the iPad ready to go.  I have downloaded tons of apps since then, including kindle, nook, netflix, hulu +, angry birds, N.O.V.A., NYT, WSJ etc.  All the apps are designed specifically to run on the iPad and they function perfectly.  The device boots quickly and opens apps almost instantaneously.  The battery life lives up to Apple's 10 hour claim.  The interface is smooth and polished.  The device itself is well built and has a high-quality feel to it.  The screen in particular is gorgeous with great color reproduction, inky blacks and terrific viewing angles.  On the whole, this is an excellent product.  I am looking forward the release of IOS 4.2, which will provide the iPad with multi-tasking capabilities, the use of air play and remote printing.  This should significantly improve the iPad's functionality.\n\nWhat the iPad is not:  As others have said, this is not a replacement for your laptop or desktop.  If you are buying this as an alternative to a more traditional computer you will be sorely disappointed.  You can not expand the storage on the device, nor can you connect the device to any external storage, which signficantly hinders functionality.  Most similar devices, including soon to be released android tablets, have microSD slots, USB 2.0/3.0 connections (mini and standard), OTG capability that will allow you to connect thumb drives and portable harddrives--the iPad has NONE of these features. If you're familiar with windows/microsoft products, you'll come to see that the treatment of files is not the same on ios as you're use to using.  You cannot save a ""document"" or ""file"" on the iPad.  The iPad's document management system just works in completely different manner.  To be clear, this is a great device for web browsing, reading ebooks, watching streaming movies from netflix, playing games and light productivity software.  It is not a real productivity device for use in place of a laptop.  Although there is some watered down productivity apps for wordprocessing and spreadsheets, this is not going to replace the microsoft word/excel suite that most of us rely on in the business world.\n\nOn the whole it is a great product with some limitations.  This really a tool for media consumption, not for productivity.  If you can live with the limitations, you will love it!!!";Android guy, but had to try the iPad
111;90.0;4.0;14.0;"The PAD fills that nebulious space between a notebook and a smartphone.  Smartphones offer the ultimate in portability plus a camera and the ability to place calls.  Notebooks offer a reasonable amount of computing power plus an expectation of portability especially in the 13 to 15"" screen size areas.\n\nHowever, smart phones are very difficult to use because the screens ARE so small. Web browsing , reading and responding to email are a chore. Notebooks provide all the functionality of desktops except expandability and usually video cards required by high end games are lacking.  But even though they are transportable, for many simple functions that such as email and web browsing, they can be cumbersome to set up and take down.  Any larger screen size than 15"" and its unlikely it will leave home.  The cost of laptops has fallen considerably over the years and from being primarily a business tool, laptop owners use the machine as their primary computer for personal use.  The laptop is unobtrusive, can be moved from room to room especially if wireless internet is available, and does not have the dearth of cords and junk that seems to easily collect around an embedded laptop.  Still, in spite of its portability, many people would just rather leave the laptop behind if their travels do not require work specific needs.\n\nSensing a need for an email machine, web browser and the ability to run regular programs should the need arise, the computer industry introduced the low cost NETBOOK. There was certainly some interest in these machines as they allowed a very convenient way of checking email and web browsing while traveling around town without the bulk of a laptop.  A NETBOOK could literally be folded up and placed in a purse or cargo pants pocket.\n\nHowever, consumers soon noticed limitations and annoyances about the NETBOOKS.  Durability was in question.  Cheap production meant a cheap product which easily broke down.  Installs of software had to be downloaded or an external drive hooked up to it. The screen was small and especially for older eyes, hard to read and make out was was being viewed.\n\nNETBOOKS were still computers and required all the maintenance of one: anti-virus had to be installed / updated or else it was susceptible for infections by any type of badware.  Startup programs had to be monitored to insure ""too much junk"" was not loading or its already slow boot times would be further impeded.  Many programs ran sluggishly, creaking along primarily on ATOM processors.  The Windows 7 Starter edition was a crippled version of Windows 7, lacking functions and the ability to run certain  programs which ran under ""normal"" Windows 7, diminishing some of its expected capability.\n\nThough the NETBOOK could be taken anywhere, its optimistic battery times were usually half its advertised rate under real world operations and begged still for the presence of a desk or other table like furniture to set up upon for proper control and use of the cursor.\n\nAnd then Apple announces the iPAD, a tablet style computer.  Tablets existed before and many of them were just morphed Windows machines into the tablet form factor with styluses that often found their way into toilets, sewer grates, and dog maws.  And a Windows tablet is typically priced 20 to 30% higher than a corresponding laptop.  It seemed a little overkill to check email and web-surf.\n\nFew guessed how well the iPAD might sell. SuperGeeks decried the lack of a true USB port, camera and the fact DOSBoX could not be installed nor a game controller, let alone a boot configuration into Linux.  They foresaw little use for such a device and predicted its utter failure.  But since its release a little less than a million a month have been selling.  Granted the Flash, Python, MySql, sed, XCode, and Linux demographic were entirely ignored; but the habitual e-mailers and Websurfing crowd was not.  And especially at these two tasks, the device excelled. Add in some other useful tasks such as e-reading, to include comic books (previously a chore on a PC or even Mac with incessant mouse / key scrolling / zooming and clicking), and some games with various other programs and the iPAD became an overnight sensation.\n\nAt once other companies began to announce various tablets of their own.  Microsoft and HP each announced products based on Windows 7, but bailed when it became apparent their technology and Windows could not deliver what they originally envisioned.  Other companies instead decide to work with the Android OS, already in use on phones and scale-up to tablet seemed much more promising.\n\nThis is all fine and good, a summary of this slice of industry from my viewpoint--so HOW does the PAD benefit me?\n\n1.=The iPAD is available NOW (though not on Amazon at a reasonable price YET).  Announced products that are canceled or have uncertain release dates are of little use.\n2. = The iPAD is unbelievably portable and unlike a smartphone, the screen quite readable.\n3.= I have not read a comic book in years.  This allows a small collection available at all times.\n4.= The entire works of Shakespeare are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.\n5.= Scads of translations of the Bible are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.\n6.= The Quran available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. Jewish friends may be upset  because they don't see the Torah's Icon, but remind them the 16 translations of the the Bible's first five books is the Torah. And FREE. Also the type can be enlarged.\n7.= If  WiFi is there, the WEB is there.\n8. = EMAIL is very easily accessed, ALL ACCOUNTS.  If one has multiple accounts, the iPADs interface makes it easy to monitor them without going around to various websites to log in and out of them\n9.= Drawing / sketch apps allow direct sketching on the screen.  Previous technology required cabled Wacom tablets or a Wacomized computer with propitiatory stylus.\n10. = Artists often make use of reference material to better paint or draw an accurate representation of an object.  Researching on a computer usually requires the expected Google search (or library visit in the olden days).  Once an image was found, it had to be added to a paint program, resized and printed out then taken over to the work area. The iPAD  allows one to go to Safari, pull up an image, save it, then go into the photo album and resize it for easy display viewing while it is being painted or drawn paint it.  Other pictures of various subjects can be switched over to easily.  The iPAD's size and the fact it has no spill vulnerable keyboard, makes for an easy unobtrusive. insertion next to an artists work area.\n\nI give the product 5 stars less one for, well I'm REALLY trying to knock it down one star, OK maybe for the lack of a USB port for printing to my non wireless printer, and perhaps some nuanced things like the included NOTES text program--no re-sizable fonts, or that I cannot delete spam without opening the email first.  But it is really hard to deduct that star.";Surprisingly useful and convenient
119;91.0;5.0;14.0;OK - so not ANYTHING - but the iPad had enabled me to get so much done when I am on the go.  I understand why people might say it is a glorified iphone, but let me tell you - the screen size is critical and all of the cool apps that are available have opened up a whole world of, well, everything. Some of the most helpful things:\n\n- Internet access on the go (Yes - GET 3G if you you are going to get this!!). I can cull email, order something I need to buy online, look up information I need (addresses, phone numbers, directions), and just read something interesting on a nice, readable screen.\n- Entertainment for my kids on the go. There are lots of cool apps for kids and it has saved me from some really otherwise difficult situations with active boys (doctor's waiting room for 45 minutes...). They have read-along books and lots of educational options, so its not just brain candy stuff, either.\n- There is a kindle app, so it can do everything a kindle book reader can. I LOVE being able to read a book on my iPad and highlight it digitally.\n- It is small enough that I can carry it around the house with me from room to room and use the notepad feature to make notes of things that would otherwise end up on scraps of paper littered around the house.\n\nIt has greatly enhanced my quality of life and now that I am accustomed to a computer I can carry in my purse, I cannot imagine not having one. If mine broke, I would replace it - right away.;Love it! Can do anything anywhere!
147;92.0;3.0;14.0;I am writing this review as I download the latest version of iTunes.. required before you can even turn this thing on !  I wanted to write this before I have a chance to fall in love with this thing because, as much as I love apple, they continually disappoint me with STUPID requirements.  There is no reason on earth that this device should not run straight out of the box !!!  Why on earth would they require that you have a mac running 10.5.1 and the latest version of iTunes on a WiFi device !!!  Stupid Stupid Stupid..  I will not recommend this device to friends, as I made that mistake with the iPod touch.  Another great device that should require ABSOLUTELY NO other computer to own and operate.  The geeks at apple need to get with the real world, they sell computers that run for 10 years then expect people to buy an new system to support a stand alone device.  Did I mention stupid yet?;Annoyed right from the get go
165;93.0;2.0;14.0;I think I hopped on the bandwagon way too soon. I saw this device at my local Best Buy and like a lamb being led to the slaughter, I foolishly bought it not realizing what I was getting into. I was not aware it could not handle the multitasking I thought it could. I was so excited that I was not aware that it was missing a camera and I thought I would be able to ditch my smartphone but reality hit me tha I can't even talk on this thing even with the 3G iPad. Then when I wanted to download an application, it wouldn't work, I then realized that I had to go through iTunes on my other computer which I had to deauthorize in order to use my iTunes songs on the iPad. The iPad looks nice but I am seriously disappointed with it now, even the gaming experience is not what they make it seem and I thought I'd get a better hang of the racing games but no matter how much I try, it's just not ergonomical for games that I like in the first person unless somebody comes up with a fix for this. I noticed it also has become increasingly heavy just to hold like a book, a fact I overlooked in my initial excitement. Maybe by the end of the year Apple will be more in tune and offer multitasking and other features that I get on my notebook, but the 500 bucks I spent is now virtually money thrown away because I am Jonesing for something better for the iPad or just a better version of it.;Regret buying it
188;94.0;2.0;14.0;The Apple iPod. A marvelous device! What I like about it is the ease of navigating among and within applications with a touch of the fingers. (No stressful laptop touch pads.) Checking email (with a $99/year mobileme subscription) could not be more user friendly. Watching streaming Netflix movies or listening to iTunes using Bluetooth wireless headphones is superb. Reading the New York Times or Time Magazine or eBooks is ideal. And, managing fingerprints with a bottle of Windex close at hand could not be more enjoyable.\n\nMy well thought-out plan was to pre-order an iPad Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G, 64G, and then after I received and got used to it, to offer my Netbook for sale on Ebay to help finance the iPad.\n\nBut, as I used the iPad over 24 hours, and as time ticked by, I looked longingly at my old and loyal friend the Netbook. So many things I could do with the Netbook, that I could not do with the iPad.  No multitasking, no USB port, and no more of the Windows and Mac applications that I had come to rely on. I started feeling depressed about it, particularly when I realized that the screen size on my iPad was about the same as my Netbook (and no need for Windex). In fact, I came to the astonishing conclusion that there was nothing I could do with the iPad that I could not do with my Netbook.\n\nSo, I changed my plans, sold the iPad on eBay (within 1 hour) for what I paid for it, and returned to my Netbook with new love and respect.\n\nNeither the Netbook nor the iPad is an alternative to a full size desktop PC, but for traveling, I discovered that the iPad is not an alternative to either one.\n\nDisclaimer:  I am in no way employed or have any financial interest in any company manufacturing or distributing Netbooks.  I got caught up in the iPad hype but have returned home. ps: In addition to my Windows 7 Netbook, I am a loyal iMac-24 user (but with Windows XP in the Bootcamp partition when I need it).;Lured Me Away from my Netbook!
196;95.0;3.0;14.0;"I have been using iPad for 10 days and decided to walk away. It is a nice tablet device that I primarily was planning to use as:\n  - ebook reader while using public transportation\n  - showing movies to kids during vacation trips\n  - using as picture hub on vacations to store/review/sort photos\n  - browser (one that I can use on the sofa)\n  - generic computer for vacations and travel (way lighter than notebook)\n  - viewing and occasionally answering email at home when primary iMac is occupied.\n\nUsually Apple devices are aesthetically pleasant to work with. iPad is not an exception, unless you are outside. The device is great for reading at home in controlled light (though a bit harder on the eyes comparing to e-ink readers), but outside (on a train/bus) it has serios glare and reflections on the screen even without direct sunlight. It felt annoying. I guess after months of use one gets used to it, but in a few days I haven't started enjoying reading with it. I wonder if matte screen would have done better.\n\nAs far as watching movies, its mono speaker lacks power. I guess I'm not a typical user here as I got two kids, so headphones aren't an option. Getting its speakers up to the iMac level would be excellent. I realize that it's hard to fit on a way smaller device, but a little bit better speakers would actually let two persons watch movie together. Again, glare and reflection of yourself on dark scenes are guaranteed in pretty much every lighting condition. Some people don't bother about it; some people do, so see for yourself.\n\nHaving SD port would be great to transfer photos from my camera. I don't really want to mess with extra cords here.\n\nOverall, it's been a pity to see device coming short of expectations.  I'll wait for 2nd version, and would love to see better screen, better speakers and SD port there. And a camera would let me Skype. I don't care much about flash or multi-tasking.\n\nApple, please, do something about the glare/reflections. These ""great"" glossy screens aren't that great for some of us, I do have mirror at home already. That stands for both iPad and iMac. Old white iMacs had way better matte screens than current glossy ones. Having matte as an option would be excellent.";iPad - great tablet with annoying flaws in its major tasks
243;96.0;3.0;14.0;"I should first note that the iPad has many differences compared to a Netbook, as the average netbook allows consumer to do certain things that an iPad cannot do, and vice versa.  They simply fall into two different categories; both having their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nMy personal reasons for using a netbook is simply the portability, low-cost solution to do basic computing and surf the web.  My everyday uses involve taking it to class and typing up notes, and managing my finances.  I typically listen to music and watch videos every now and then.  My netbook can play YouTube videos decently, but it does lag a little when going into full screen.\n\nThe iPad operates fast and smooth.  Watching videos and using the apps seems to give me that ""experience"" that I don't necessarily get from a netbook.  Using the familiar iTunes, it's very easy to manage and purchase content for my iPad.  I can tell you that this is a big strength that the iPad has.\n\nHowever, iPad is definitely not a smart solution for my college classes.  I found it harder to type on while in class, making a few mistakes every now and then.  I did get use to the keyboard over time, but it wasn't comfortable compared to the netbook.  Having to look up information and switching back and forth between applications made it an obvious choice that this device is more intended for internet surfing and multimedia.  I feel that the iPad was intended to be a device that is easy to use, so I don't expect multitasking to be available to the device (at all).\n\nThe iPad's speakers doesn't sound loud, so I recommend using earphones.\n\nA feature that I thought would benefit me the most was using the iPad as an eBook reader, too.  The iPad does display content colorful and brilliant, but at 1.5 pounds (compared to 10.2 ounces for a Kindle), this device is quite uncomfortable holding with one hand.  I don't want to drop it either, so two hands it is.\n\nFor my purposes of reading eBooks and typing up notes in class, this device unfortunately doesn't serve my needs.  For somebody who uses computers for typing emails, surf the web, share photos and videos, and taking advantage of the cool apps, you may find this product more suited for you (just about what the common consumer would use a computer for).  So why did I give this 3 stars?  The device is built sturdy, but it does feel fragile (with no doubt I can easily break these things).  That being said, you do feel obligated to pay a good amount of money for insurance, protection, and accessories.  For 700-800 dollars, I think I'll wait until the prices go down before owning a luxury item like this again.";Switched back to a netbook
37;97.0;4.0;13.0;The iPad 2 will be in stores in April 2011, so don't fork over the cash just yet. Early specifications rumors are a faster processor and a front and rear camera system allowing you to use the FaceTime app. So just hold off for those who have not gotten one yet for a few months. It will be worth the wait!;Don't buy an iPad yet!
48;98.0;3.0;13.0;"Don't buy an ipad.  Unless you really love touch screens.  The touch screen is about the only thing the ipad really does well.  Apple built its reputation on making great operating systems that were far and away the most user friendly in the business.  No hassle computing.  And true to this spirit, the ipads touchscreen really does open up a whole new world of possibilities to make operating systems even more user friendly.  Apple has done great job of highlighting this potential in the ipad.\n\nUnfortunately, what the touch screen has given it, apple's new-found shortsightedness has taken away.  This is not a machine for surfing the web and if you buy one, mainly with that purpose in mind, you will be quite disappointed.  The main reason is the ipad will not run flash player- A technology that is ubiquitous on the web, and something that apple has intentionlly decided not to support.  This means a good portion of web pages that you are used to running flawlessly (on windows and apple OSX) on browsers like Firefox, Chrome, IE, or Safari will simply crash Safari for the ipad.  So if you buy this machine, you won't really get the world-wide-web, you'll get the apple-wide-web. Steve Jobs has commented how flash will (eventually) become unnecessary with HTML 5 and that's why they don't support flash.  Well, maybe...I think it's appropriate to quote John Maynard Keynes here.  Apple, ""in the long run, we are all dead,"" and would love to surf the real web on a great tablet today!\n\nUnfortunately, this approach to Flash is sticking with the spirit of the machine in general.  Consider you can only get Apple approved apps at the Apple appstore (unless you want to hack the machine and jailbreak it).  With this machine you ultimately are pushed content that Apple has chosen, rather than given the ability to find the content yourself in an unencumbered access to the jungle of the web.\n\nIt really sad to see Apple go down this road.  I grew up on Apples and have always paid the extra money for that, oh so friendly, user experience.  It's too bad that a company started by ""two guys in their garage"" with a vision of great computing has turned into a corporation with a vision of higher returns to the shareholders.  The world would be a better place if Apple just stuck to making the best operating systems in the world and forgot about the whole business of trying to own as much of the world wide web as you can stake your claim on.";Don't buy an ipad.... unless
154;99.0;5.0;13.0;When I started trying cases in the seventies and into the eighties, I would take yellow legal pads to trial. By the end of the trial they would be full of rather cryptic notes for jury selection, opening statement, witnesses, and closing argument. By the nineties, I was a computer-savvy guy who sometimes rented a laptop for big trials, but usually relied a never ending supply of legal pads.\n\nBy the millennium, I had a PC tablet on which I could load electronic copies of the files and depositions, and take notes during trial. I could actually walk about about the courtroom with it just like it was a very heavy legal pad. After I switched my office's computers from PCs to Macs. I would still bring it to trials. Then my tablet died (as most Windows machines are want to do) and I was back stuck at the lectern with my MacBook Pro. When I wanted to wander the courtroom while examining witnesses, I had to use my trusty old legal pad. Like many Mac enthusiasts I prayed for the day Apple would offer a tablet.\n\nFor me that day came on April 27, when my 64GB WiFi+3G iPad was delivered. Since then I bring it to court in lieu of my laptop. Unlike my old Tablet PC, 3G gives me constant and immediate Internet access. And that is the principal reason to opt for the 3G over the WiFi only iPad. Many courthouses do not have hotspots. If you don't need Internet wherever you are, then the other model may be enough.\n\nAs to storage, more memory  is better. You are going to want to load, movies, music and photos on it. 32GB is not enough. Given the marginal increments in costs of doubling the memory 64GB, the present maximum will seem tiny as the iPad evolves over the years. If you get it now, you may be able to postpone upgrading a year from now.\n\nThe iPad, like the iPhone is basically a Swiss Army knife, and like the Swiss knife it is infinitely customizable. As a Mac user I am comfortable with iWork, Apples Office Suite. Consisting of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote each applications for the iPad, they all read Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and export them. You will want to buy them. Other critical work apps include Evernote, iAnnotatate PDF, PaperDesk, Penultimate, Dropbox and GoodReader. I track my expenses on the go with an iPhone app JetSet. On the fun side I read books using Kindle for iPad, which I prefer to Apples's iBook.\n\nOn the negative side, at the moment the iPad lacks multi-taking, and has no camera. That will change. But waiting for those additions is no excuse not to get an iPad today.\n\nMy iPad is a tool not a toy, I keep telling myself. And as a courtroom tool, it is small and light just like a yellow legal pad.  But when I stroll about with my iPad, I can't help having a big smile on my face.;A lawyer looks at an iPad
202;100.0;1.0;13.0;I'm just writing these lines to be able to rate it, having returned mine ,I mostly agree with all the other reviews the iPad is overrated mostly because the hype surrounding it,;All about hype
241;101.0;5.0;13.0;"Frankly, I had my doubts about this device when it was first announced. Looking at the specifications, this 9.7 inch device running iPhone OS simply begged to be called ""a larger iPod Touch"".\n\nTrying the device for the first time, however, completely changed my mind about this device. It's not the hardware specification that matters, it's the EXPERIENCE.\n\nUsing the device is an amazing experience. The only word I am going to describe this experience is ""LIBERATING"".\n\nI have a 27in iMac, a 19in custom built PC, and i've owned a unibody MacBook Pro before. In actual usage, none of them allow me to surf the web lying face-up on bed, or lying sideways on a sofa, yet all of them confine my hands to a mouse/trackpad and a keyboard.\n\nWhereas the iPad gives me so much freedom. I find myself using it lying on bed, on a sofa, and even standing. When I think back about my previous computing experience, I can't help but to ask myself: ""Why should I confine myself to use my own computer in an upright position with my butt glued to a chair and my hands stuck on a table?"" In fact, i find myself using this device even more than my beloved 27in iMac simply because it invites me to use it everywhere without boundary.\n\nObviously, you can argue that an smartphone or an iPod Touch can also be used in such a fashion. But allow me to convince you, the display on this device makes all the difference. The display is a 9.7 inch LED backlit IPS display that offers stunning color, and an unbelievable viewing angle. I can literally look at the screen at an angle nearly parallel to the it and still be able to see the amazing image. The screen resolution is also optimal for viewing websites, since most websites are designed for a 1024x768 resolution. This means that no zooming or panning is required when viewing websites on the iPad.\n\nThe form factor is just right, holding it in hand feels great. It feels extremely sturdy and yet a pleasure to touch. The body of the device is extremely clean and minimalist.\n\nThe device is extremely fast, scrolling feels very fluid, the entire OS is very responsive. The Multi Touch interface is intuitive and fun to use. The battery life is simply superb, i've used it continuously for more than 10 hours with constant video/music playback and occasional gaming.\n\nObviously this iPad is not going to do programming, encoding videos, or music production. (Some VNC apps do let you control your computer from your iPad) But for my casual computing needs like music/video, web browsing, youtube, facebook and light gaming, this excellent device presents a better experience than traditional laptops. It is a great complementary device to my iMac, with apps like Air Sharing HD and LogMeIn Ignition, i can even access local storage on my iMac from my iPad through local wifi or the internet.\n\nOverall, the iPad is a remarkable device, and i am not afraid to say that it gave me the best computing experience i've ever had.";Nothing short of extraordinary.
247;102.0;3.0;13.0;So i went out and bought this brand new Apple iPad on the very fist day. I am very satisfied, but have decided to attempt to return it. Ill explain that.\n\nFor the stuff it does (apps, ebooks, games, music, pics, videos, etc) it does it all flawlessly and i couldn't possibly complain about any of it. Beyond expectations actually!\n\nThe problem is it is BIG! I figured i would use it to watch movies or shows on my boring train ride every day. But what do i do with it when im not using it? If i carried a briefcase this wouldnt be an issue, but i dont. I can leave it on my lap, but then i risk either dropping it or being targeted by some thug who wants a new $700 toy for free.\n\nThe other issue is that its DELICATE! Anyone with an iphone or ipod knows just how delicate these screens are ... and this one is even bigger than those! You can tell its made well, but a single drop will break the screen guaranteed.\n\nSo while i do think its an amazing device, i think i can easily live without it. Maybe it would have been an easier decision to keep it if it hadn't cost me $700 ($499 + tax + replacement insurance which you MUST have!!)\n\nThat's all. Good luck with yours, enjoy.\n\nPS, im downgrading my rating because i spent $700 on something and it doesnt even come with a case or protective screen?? Common apple seriously!!! And then they boast the HD screen for movies ... but the movies cos $20 EACH!! They boast the ebook reader, but the good illustrated books are expensive!! Common how much money do i have to have so i can enjoy this thing??;The iPad is amazing, but ill return it

99;104.0;5.0;12.0;Addendum Dec. 13th 2010...Comments on new IOS operating sys. for IPad\n\nThe Big Three improvements:\n\n1.) Multitasking...you can't do split screens BUT you can close one operation (or several if you wish), open another and then go back to the original(s) and open it/them to the same page you were working on.  VERY convenient!\n\n2.) Folders...great to organize different categories of apps and will allow you to reduce IPad screen clutter of the huge number of apps that most of us will collect over time.\n\n3.) Mobile-me. This is now a FREE feature of IPad with the new Operating System...use to be a paid yearly subscription ($99/year). With this you can find your lost IPad on your home PC or Mac, and once Mobile-me is alerted, your IPad will beep in about 15-20 minutes. It will even allow you to REMOTELY WIPE YOUR IPAD MEMORY, so sensitive info can be deleted, if needed!\n\nThere are several other 'improvements', most of which don't concern me as much as the 3 mentioned above.\n\nMy original review...\n\nSome thoughts after having used my Ipad 64 for about 1 month.\n\nSome (but by no mean all) of the things I appreciate:\n\n1.) the large, high resolution, touch screen on an extremely thin idevice.\n\n2.) the CONVENIENCE...all because of the portability and the ability to connect ANYWHERE to the internet, locally with WiFi or globally with G3. Allowing me to travel and yet do all the things I'd normally do at home. i.e. check e-mail, pay bills and surf.\n\n3a.) the Itunes set-up...making it easy with an Itunes account to buy apps, music, videos, books, movies etc.\n\n3b.) the Itunes set-up...making it easy to copy, back-up and sync your Ipad with your computer at home...for example, allowing you the make copies of everything you buy from Itunes and even books etc. you may buy from Ibooks or Kindle...this means that if you've finished your book or don't need an App any more, you can delete it from your IPad, but it's still available to you on your computer if you should need to reinstall it again to your IPad.  You can also copy all bookmarks from your pc/mac to the IPad Safari browser as well as e-mail addresses from your computer to your IPad (even if you use a hotmail account).\n\n4.) the ease with which I was able to sync my Apple wireless Keyboard via the bluetooth available on the IPad...done in less than 1 minute.\n\n5.) the ability to adjust the font size (so you won't even need your reading glasses) and brightness when reading books, ESPECIALLY the option of 'white on black' screen for night-time reading (never realized how comfortable on the eyes this would make reading in a darkened area)\n\n6.) Google maps...just incredible with G3 service...Be prepared to say good-bye to your GPS if your IPad has G3.\n\nLost?...Touch the 'current location' button at the top of your Google map App, and you get a satellite map of where you are, with your exact location marked with a red pin.\n\nWant directions from point 'A' to point 'B'...just type in your destinations.\n\nWant a restaurant, library, hospital etc. in the area your in, just type your request in the 'search' window and you'll find your inquiries marked with red pins on your map.\n\nAnd it gets better...say you asked for restaurants in an area, touching any individual red pin you got in the reply to your search gives you the name, address, phone No. and (if available) e-mail address plus directions to get there from your current location. AND it allows you to save this information (if you want) in your list of contacts, with a simple touch of the screen.\n\n7.) Audio...although the built-in speaker is mono, the headphone jack gives exceptional quality stereo sound.\n\n8.) About 10 hours of battery time on a full charge.\n\n9.) The ability to expand the size of anything your reading by simply spreading apart two fingers while touching the screen.\n\nWhat's missing:\n\n1.) no USB Port...maybe not as important as I'd initially thought, what with bluetooth available...may mean some additional purchase for such things as a wireless  mouse, keyboard, printer etc.\n\n2.) no multitasking...The one MAJOR shortcoming of the IPad...you can't open a split screen to work on, and as everyone who has used a computer is aware, this is a very useful, time-saving feature. But you know, with all that this unit offers in the way of quality and convenience, I can live with this one deficiency.\n\nConclusion:\nMore useful...more an indispensable part of my life than I'd ever have believed possible.\nThe large screen along with its thin profile makes it the ideal traveling idevice.\nBecause of no multitasking...4 3/4 Stars.\n\nRay Nicholson\n\nP.S.\n1.) I purchased the 64 Gb edition of Ipad because I figured that Apps would fill it quickly...well this may eventually happen, but with nearly 3 screens of Apps, so far I've used less than 2 Gb of space\n2.) This product may be lower priced at other locales.;My IPad 64 with WiFi and G3...better than I expected
131;105.0;4.0;12.0;"Before buying my iPad, I spent about an hour in the Apple store playing with it.  I knew I'd get some real use from it, and I knew that it met many of my wants for an ultraportable computer, but the tiny underpowered thing costs almost as much as a macbook!\n\nObviously, I laid down my credit card and walked out of the store with it.  The store is near my office but three hours from my home.  I must admit, I had regrets in the three hour drive home.  A $900 10"" iPod touch?  Am I nuts?\n\nAfter owning and using it for two weeks, I no longer regret the purchase as much, but I still feel that it is overpriced.  My model is the 64GB with 3G+Wifi.  I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on ""HD"" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.\n\nI have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.\n\nI'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a ""gamer"" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.\n\nBack to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.\n\nMore on document viewing.\nThe biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.\n\nThe built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the ""magical"" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.\n\nWeb browsing is the other ""killer app.""  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called ""Atomic Web.""  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.\n\nThe app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.\n\nWatching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13"".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.\n\nGoogle maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.\n\nBattery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.\n\nTyping on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.\n\nYou WILL need to buy a case for it.  The ""acase"" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.\n\nI'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.\n\nI bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.\n\nIn conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes.";3-star product, 4-star usefulness
213;106.0;2.0;12.0;"THE IDEAL\n\nImagine this: A tablet Mac with a pressure-sensitive touch screen that turns Photoshop into a one-stop Wacom-killing portable graphic design supersolution. It has a built-in iSight camera (as most Macs do) so you can video Skype with anybody in the world at any time, thereby creating a revolution in telecommunications and the eventual death of the cell phone! 3G is built in, so you can video chat any time without needing additional hardware peripherals. It has (at least) one USB port, just like the MacBook Air, so you can upload your pictures to iPhoto easily... unless you shot your photos directly from the iPad's iSight camera (which BTW swivels to either be front-facing or outward-facing). The device runs OS X just like any other Mac, so you can run all of your professional graphic design or pro audio applications on it, with the touch of a finger! That's right, it runs a version of OS X that fully supports pressure-sensitive multi-touch functionality. The price is between $1000 and $1500 depending on the configuration you get.\nSince hearing early rumors of an Apple tablet this is what I imagined and was hoping for. Now I am disappointed because my idealist expectations have not been lived up to. But enough about what isn't - let's discuss what is...\n\nTHE REALITY\n\nThe iPad is not a Mac. It's a big-ass iPod touch. No, it's not even a big-ass iPhone, or something that can replace a phone. It's a big-ass iPod touch. It doesn't support Flash, or any other Adobe products. Steve Jobs has made enemies with both Adobe and Google now and you, the consumer, are bearing the consequences. OK, to be fair, it's not entirely Steve's fault, but he doesn't appear to be cooperatively working toward a solution for us.\nIt lacks an iSight camera, so forget video chatting. There is only one port on it, which is the 30-pin connector for syncing with iTunes and charging. If you want to pay extra for the adapter, there is one that will allow you to plug in your USB camera or SD card. It makes sense when you consider it from Apple's perspective: allowing standard USB functionality would mean that you could just plug in your own thumb drive (or hard drive) and instantly upgrade a 16GB model to a 48GB model (or more). For me this all feels limiting since I am used to being able to open Finder and see/edit all of my documents, software, even system files, and transfer them to any external device.\nThis leads me to my final gripe: All of the software you install on this device must be approved my Apple. It all goes through the App Store, folks. That means you can't install things that Apple doesn't like... i.e. torrent software, adult content, competing browsers like FireFox, your cracked version of the Adobe Creative Suite (not that I would do this), and all open-source software. Even if Apple approves some competitor's software (like Skype and Dropbox), they can pull those titles from the App Store as soon as they decide they dislike them. This disempowers you as an end-user. Apple is asking the masses to surrender their computing freedoms and since the majority of consumers don't grasp these concepts it is allowed to continue. 1984 was not like ""1984"", but 2010 sure is.\nAlso, if you already own an iPhone and pay AT&T $30 a month for 3G data, get ready to do it all over again with the iPad. That's right, $60/month if you own both!\nOn a positive note, I commend both Apple and AT&T for making the 3G version free of a 2-year contract. This is exciting news. Another pleasant surprise of the iPad has been the price. It ranges from just $500 to $830 in cost, depending on the configuration.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nEven though the iPad is nothing like what I had been hoping for, can it be a solution for some people? YES! Yes, it can.\nThe people who will benefit most from the iPad are people with simple needs looking for a cheap portable computer. It's not for me, but I can't say that it's not for some people. It's a cool device for kids to play games on or for your grandma to send you emails from, but it's not for multimedia professionals or die-hard Mac people. It's not a computer and we just have to accept that.\n\nCan it do some things that a Mac can't? Yes! It can run almost all of the same apps that your iPhone or iPod touch can, which is pretty cool. And most importantly, it has portable versions of all three iWork applications. This means you can create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations on the go. The iWork apps are a step in the right direction for the iPad, making it more computer-like. I have been a fan of iWork since its initial conception on the Mac and it has always been easier to use and produced more professional-looking results than anything MS Office (or even Open Office) has had to offer. But don't expect the iPad versions of the iWork titles to boast the same full set of features as the Mac versions.\n\nTo be fair, we must also consider that the iPad platform is still brand new and we will surely see many more apps released for it that will be useful to many people.\n\nOVERVIEW OF AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS\n\n1. iPad - Best for reading e-books, running apps, watching videos, web-browsing, emailing, creating simple documents, and listening to music.\n\n2. Hackintosh netbook - Apple hates them, but they're the cheapest portable platform for OS X and they do the job! I admit, I'm a fan.\n\n3. MacBook Air - It's a bit large, it's lacking in ports, it's overpriced, but it's lightweight and it's the smallest Mac you can get.\n\n4. ModBook - For those who just must have an Apple tablet. It's basically a Wacom screen tablet fused with a MacBook. Cool, but expensive.\n\n5. iPhone/iPod touch - You should be familiar with these by now. One is a phone with a paid internet subscription. The other is Wi-Fi only.\n\n6. PC netbook - Eeewww! Don't do this. You're only hurting yourself. (Linux users are somewhat excused)  :-)\n\n7. Amazon Kindle - The iPad has succeeded in making the Kindle and other e-book readers obsolete. Don't get it.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope this review has been helpful.";It's a big-ass iPod touch. It's not a Mac. It's not a netbook. But it still has its place.
13;107.0;1.0;8.0;The first generation iPad cannot be updated beyond ios 5.1.1.  Why does that matter? Because most apps are ios 6.0 or higher.  Don't waste your money on this version- its nothing but an expensive paperweight.;Cannot update
17;108.0;5.0;10.0;I wanted an iPad and thought about getting iPad second gen. But was kinda pressed for money so just wanted an experience with it first before dumping loads of money on something that might just be sitting around after a while but boy that isn't the case with the one I received. It was in mint condition not one scratch! Now it doesn't have a camera sure ur for me that wasn't a big deal because my girlfriend takes the pictures in the relationship lol! Plus how ackward is it to take pictures with these things lol just get a digital camera or something. though it would be nice to ovvoo or FaceTime or what have you. I have no collimating though. It's wicked fast well at least faster then my computer so I got no complaints.\n\nI also put the otterbox commuter case to protect it giants future scratches. If you're looking for a cheap way to experience the iPad generations then I suggest you just trying first gen.;iPad first gen.
38;109.0;2.0;11.0;From the minute I first saw an iPad I knew I wanted one but cash was short and my laptop was doing the job.\nWhen my laptop started to fail, I started researching the iPad and all sounded great, but there seemed to be a lot of missing information.\nI purchase the iPad and started the learning curve.\nIt is cute and a pleasure to use for the things they promote like photos, movies, navigation, web suffing, but A laptop it is not.\nIt is terrible at word processing, spreadsheets, web design, even adding an attachment to an email or saving an attachment.  It does not store files, cut and paste is a beast, anything needing a right mouse or control. I am tempted to take it back but now I have spent a small fortune on apps that try to emulate a laptop.\n\nThink twice before replacing a laptop or desktop computer with an iPad.\n\nRod;What the iPad does not do
43;110.0;5.0;11.0;In this review, I compare the iPad to 5 other devices I own, use, and love: the Sony Reader, the Amazon Kindle 1 and 2, the iPod Touch, and a laptop.  As you likely know, the iPad fills a niche that is between an ebook reader or similar device and a laptop or netbook.  Although there are an enormous number of apps available for the iPad, it definitely does not have the full range of function of a laptop. For example, I use my laptop for programming using MS Visual Studio, web development with Dreamweaver, and graphic work with Photoshop and Illustrator.  The iPad can be made to do a little bit of all of these functions, but for any large or complex work of that nature, a full-scale computer it the right device.\n\nWith that said, I find a similar distinction between my smaller devices (the ebook readers and the iPod touch) and the iPad.  I love my Kindle(s) and will not give them up, however, the big advantage I find in the iPad over those readers is the larger size and the additional functionality.  The Kindle is still my preferred device for reading ebooks that were created as ebooks, but I now use the iPad for reading pdf documents. If you have ever struggled with trying to load pdfs onto an ereader, I strongly suggest you try the iPad.  For most pdfs, there is not even a need to use one of the many programs that help squeeze them down or trim their margins, etc.  Most pdfs can easily be read at their native size on the iPad, and moving the document or zooming slightly can be accomplished much more easily and quickly on the iPad as compared to the ereaders.\n\nThe screen on the iPad is, frankly, better than I expected for reading.  After nearly 30 years of working with computers, I instanly loved the eink display (as in the Kindle, Sony, etc.) the first time I used it.  It still provides a better visual image for reading than the iPad as long as you have adequate lighting.  However, the iPad screen is as good or better than the best monitor I have used.  It tends not to give much eye strain even after extended periods of reading.  Of course, it is backlit, which is good and bad -- good because you can use it in most situations except for very bright light, e.g. direct sunlight.  The bad it that when you are reading, you are also looking directly into an artificial light source, and, eventually, that will cause eye strain for just about everyone.\n\nThe iPad also has many other functions that it performs very much better than ereaders.  For example, it makes a very sericeable web browser, with the *big* exception that it cannot display flash videos or animations.  It also does not support MS Silverlight (an environment similar to Flash) as of February, 2011, although one never knows what will happen in the future.\n\nFinally, I have found the iPod Touch (and equivalently, the iPhone) to be a very hand device that I can easily carry in my pocket that provides some ereading capability, some web browsing capability, and the ability to run numerous apps, albeit on quite a small screen.  The iPad does all of these things, barring slipping into my pocket, and does them better.  I still carry the iPod in my pocket for quick access to my contacts, my calendar, my task list, etc., but as soon as I am indoors, the iPod goes away in favor of the iPad.  One last point with respect to the iPod Touch or iPhone vs. the iPad -- the former devices have a mirror-shiny finish on the back, which is beautiful when you take it out of the box, but it is absolutely impossible to keep it scratch-free without using some kind of protective cover.  So, with those devices, no matter how careful you intend to be, your choices are to keep it in a cover or live with scratches.  The iPad, on the other hand, has a matte finish on the metal back.  I have no dooubt the it, too, will accumulate tiny scratches if left uncovered, by they are much less likely to be seen and to diminish the lovely design of the iPad.;Excellent multipurpose device

142;112.0;5.0;11.0;"I have had my iPad 16GB Wi-Fi for about 7 weeks now, and it really is what the commercials say it is: magical and revolutionary. Sure, there are other tablets out on the market, and they are cheap. But the Apple iPad is more than a tablet, or even an oversized iPod - it's an experience and a way of life.\n\nI take mine everywhere I go. I use it to take notes in meetings, watch streaming movies from Netflix, watch TV shows from ABC, play games, do crossword puzzles, use it in the kitchen for recipes and shopping lists, surf the Internet, shop, organize information, do SMS text messaging on it, read books, write papers - in fact, adding a Bluetooth keyboard, there isn't much I used to do on my notebook computer than I can do with my iPad.\n\nWorried that you might not be able to read your Amazon Kindle books? There is a Kindle app for the iPad that you can read all your Kindle books with, no book light necessary! There are even native genealogy apps available, along with thousands of other apps, and many free ones to choose from. Concerned you'll have to take a power adapter everywhere? Pffft, I say. I have used mine over 10 hours on a single charge, and that includes watching video for 3 of those hours! So you needn't worry about battery life.\n\nMy iPad has changed my life by making it streamlined and efficient- most everything I want to do is a mere touch away; it'll change your life, too.

162;113.0;4.0;11.0;"My dad recently bought one of these, so had a chance to use it for a few days before he took it. My impressions of it are mostly positive; my two main gripes about it are these:\n\n1. On my Android phone, if I buy an app from the marketplace, I have 24 hours to try it out and decide whether I like it. As far as I can tell, there's no such feature on the iPad. So if you buy something and it really sucks, oh well. There's no trial period or anything for these apps. I don't recall this being mentioned in any of the reviews I read, but I think this is pretty important. I guess reviewers think anybody who's interested in an iPad already has an iPhone, so this would've been common knowledge to that audience.\n\n2. iTunes is just a huge PITA. I downloaded and installed a fresh copy of iTunes on my PC, hooked the iPad up via USB, and it promptly deleted all the books and apps I had on the iPad without so much as a warning. After that, when I set up iTunes on my dad's PC, it complained that the iPad could only sync with one iTunes library (presumably because I had already synced it on mine), and wanted to erase everything that was on the iPad. At least it warned me this time, but if you plan to sync the iPad with two different computers, you're going to have to jump through some hoops.\n\nOverall, it seems to be a very scaled down Android device, but that's ok, since this thing isn't really targeted at people who would ever know the difference anyway. Plus, there's a better selection of apps here. I probably would've bought one myself if I could find a way around not having to use iTunes to get content from the PC to the iPad. I did some searching to see if you could jailbreak it and just drag and drop stuff onto it without using iTunes, but no such luck.\n\nAs far as my dad is concerned, he's not a complete computer novice, but not exactly highly skilled either, and he really likes the iPad. I installed the MLB At Bat program, and he can stream the audio from baseball games right on the device while browsing the web. I told him he could watch the games with an MLB.TV subscription, but he likes listening to them more. *shrugs*\n\nFor those claiming it's just a big iPod Touch, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The size of the iPad makes it hard to carry around, but I can assure you... having a screen that's 3x bigger is a huge plus if you play with an iPod Touch (or similar device) a lot while on your couch :)\n\nAnd those of you who are dissing the iPad because it doesn't have USB/HDMI ports, a camera, or multitasking capabilities are really missing the point. In about 15-20 minutes, I was able to sit down with my dad and show him just about everything there is to know about this device, and now he can download and install his own apps and do whatever else, and he can do it while kicked back in his recliner. And I don't have to worry about him getting viruses and malware, and the ease of use of the iPad is certainly going to cut down on my support calls :) So I guess you could say that him having one of these benefits both of us. It has a much less steeper learning curve than a netbook, and there's little-to-know security risks involved.";Like a netbook for the layperson
164;114.0;3.0;11.0;"I've had my iPad for a few days. I like the limited mobility it gives me to read e-mail or news while wandering the house. I love the touch screen (most of the time) and being able to flick between pages or quickly scroll through a list. It does have some serious limitations though.\n\nThe wifi sucks. It will be fine one minute and then say it's not connected. It also frequently loses the wifi password so I get to type that in two or three (or more) times every day. There are three laptops and a netbook in the house that don't have any wifi problems. I found an Apple support article that said this problem was only with WEP, nope, I'm using WPA2. Also, be sure to down the user guide to iBooks (it's free) because the help files are all online which isn't helpful when the wifi won't work.\n\nThe keyboard is usable as long as you don't need numbers or punctuation. Since those require that you switch to the ""other"" keyboard and then switch back you shouldn't plan on doing any real work on it. It's fine for chatting or quick e-mails but anything else is a major annoyance. Spending 30 seconds fiddling with the cursor when you just need to move over one space is very frustrating.\n\nThe mobile browser is pretty lame. It doesn't support a feature that Google Docs and many other sites use to edit content so don't plan on making changes on those online documents. It also won't change font sizes, yes, you can zoom in but that doesn't reflow the text so you'll be scrolling to read the end of the line. It's not huge as flicking around the screen is easy but it's annoying. Web sites with crowded interfaces can be frustrating as it's easy to click the link next to the one you wanted. Fingers don't make good precision pointing devices. Also the book organization seems lame but I haven't really played with it yet.\n\nThere's also the form factor. It's too heavy to hold for a long period and laying down isn't always a good solution. You should also plan on getting a case that doubles as a stand, preferably two-way (horizontal and vertical). I wish someone would make one that included a shoulder strap as it's very awkward to carry.\n\nOverall I think that it's a pretty slick gadget though given what it does, and doesn't do, I think it's seriously over priced. If you're okay with touchpads and small keyboards you're probably better off with a netbook. If you want to do real work get a laptop. If you just want to read the news and e-mail at the kitchen table (and your access point is really close) then this might be a great gadget for you. Just don't plan to edit any Google Docs.\n\n----\nPS. Reading Kindle books is much, much better on the iPad than on the Kindle. The touch screen makes a HUGE difference.";A nice gadget but not for serious use
177;115.0;5.0;11.0;This is a wonderful device. I'm barely using my laptop anymore (only at the office.)\nI did an experiment and tried to spend the entire day with the ipad without resorting to my macbook pro.\nThings I did that day:\n1- checked my mail, replied to messages, forwarded messages\n2- Opened excel sheets, power point presentations\n3- opened video attachments, viewed pictures\n4- edited excel sheets, modified presentations\n5- browsed the internet (atomic is a great browser that has tabbed browsing and which is free.)\n6- chatted on skype, had voice calls and conf calls\n7- facebook\n8- had msn conversations and chats\n\nThe only things I couldn't do with the ipad was power usage things such as convert video files, etc...\n\nHighly recommended, and brings unlimited freedom!;I barely use my laptop anymore
190;116.0;2.0;11.0;We bought 2 Ipads for our business to demo some applications to customers. At first the WiFi connection worked well and the demos went amazingly well. But the Ipad's internet connection failed frequently making it unreliable. We tested in parallel with a MacBook which had no problems syncing to the wireless network at the same same the ipad failed. We tried this on 5 different WiFi networks and each had the same issues. We tried to return them to the Apple Store in San Francisco and they insisted there was no problem with them based upon their brief test and they said they never heard of this problem before (it has been documented all over the web including MacWorld). It took an hour of running it up Apple's chain before they finally agreed to a refund. I hope they can get this WiFi issue resolved - then it would be a good product. But until we know it is set, we will not buy any more of these.;WiFi unreliable / Good luck returning!
197;117.0;4.0;11.0;"First off: no, it isn't a portable computer replacement. If you expect it to be, you'll only be disappointed. Nor is it just an oversized PDA despite claims to the contrary. Instead, it's a robust adjunct to your main computer. It allows me to take most of my web browsing, game playing, email reading, etc. away from my desk. In large part, whether the iPad suits your needs will depend on whether you can find apps for it that suit your needs. So far there's a wide array of apps, so I haven't found this to be much of a problem--but again, it'll depend on your needs.\n\nIt's true that there are some things you just can't do on an iPad, like view Flash content on websites. I do find this occasionally annoying, but honestly, I just hope it convinces more websites to stop using so much Flash content. I've always found that it bogs down my machine and causes more problems than it fixes.\n\nIn contrast, I've found that the apps on my iPad load and run super-fast. They're streamlined to have a small footprint, and it shows. They load so fast that load screen tips in games often flash past before I can read them. They also take up a surprisingly small amount of memory; I'm amazed at how slowly I'm using up my 16G!\n\nThe on-screen keyboard is actually pretty good, and suits normal finger size much better than that on the tinier iPhone screen, but it still isn't meant for extended typing. I'm also addicted to the touch-screen interface. It feels so natural that I find myself trying to use my laptop as though it had one.\n\nSince I do a lot of reading and reviewing, and I absolutely hate the other e-readers I've played with (the screen flash when turning pages would drive me batty before I finished a single book), the iPad's value as an e-reader was important to me. In this, it truly shines. You can download the Barnes & Noble reader and the Kindle reader for free. GoodReader makes a fantastic pdf reader (just import pdfs from the app tab when synching with your computer). iBooks, however, blew me away. As a book geek, I really like the experience of reading a book rather than a computer file. And iBooks looks the most like a book.\n\nI'm truly amazed by the screen quality, the speed of everything, the variety of apps available, and the utility of the iPad as an e-reader. I can use it near-constantly for heavy-use things like gameplay and the charge lasts me a good 24 hours.";Not perfect, but highly enjoyable!
205;118.0;4.0;11.0;"Like many people here and everywhere, I was absolutely apprehensive about the iPad(or the giant iPod Touch as iPad haters like to call it). But after spending a few days with this device, I can tell you for sure that this is the way a large screen touch input based device should have been done.\n\nThe Things that i love about the iPad\n\n1) The Keyboard is just awesome . Very easy to type even when using one hand.\n2) iBooks - Simply fantastic , Hopefully, the catalog will expand massively. I prefer this to the kindle when I am indoors because everything in an iBook is in colour.\n3) iWorks - Fantastic even though you cannot export to Powerpoint or Excel formats. Only Word is supported. Even the lack of ""Track Changes"" option did not  bother me much.\n4) Good Battery life\n5) The ability to import Photos on the go.\n6) Availability of Netflix App\n7) You can actually do things efficiently using just an iPad and a internet source.\n8) Safari for the iPad is a very efficient browser. Obviously, it does not support flash, but then that is price adobe paid for some crime they committed some time back.\n9) Most of the apps that work on an iTouch/iPhone works on the iPad.\n10) Does not heat up much after heavy usage.\n\nThings that are not available in the iPad when they should have been\n1) Finder for the iPad\n2) Network Explorer( so you can drag and drop docs from your other laptops/desktops into your ipad without using iTunes) - I have tonnes of pdf articles/books and other docs in my home server and would have loved to have this functionality)\n3) Print functionality ( Though this depends on HP , Canon and their ilk)\n4) bluetooth mouse connectivity\n5) ability to transfer data (music/files) using the camera connector kit accessory) from a USB drive or SD card drive.\n6) A Nice Photo Editor( Apple developed).\n7) I really did not feel the absence of multi tasking, but then I can appreciate controlled multitasking wherein I have control over what apps are allowed to run in the background.\n\nThings that are annoying\n1) iPad is smudge heaven - you don't notice those smudges when it is on, but the moment you press the sleep button/lock screen button , you can see hundreds of smudges.\n2) The screen is too glossy - I presonally prefer Matte, but we don't have that option anymore.\n3) Reading in broad daylight when the sun is right over your head is annoying\n4) Absence of a Finder/Windows Explorer kinda application\n\nOverall, I feel that there is no show stopper here and that the iPad is actually a good device for the average male/female and for anyone who is not into anything too technical.\n\nP.S , I have a verizon mifi and my iPad tethers to the mifi device. I have not experienced any network related issues so far. It seems sturdy and reliable.";Awesome device
217;119.0;4.0;11.0;Summary:\nThe iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.\n\nExterior:\nI admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.\nThe iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.\n\nThe outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.\n\nThe only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.\n\nHardware:\nThe screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.\nMy unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.\nSpeaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.\nOne annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.\n\nThe iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.\nThe iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).\nFinally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]\nFinally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.\n\nUsing the iPad.\nImmediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).\nThe large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.\nThe home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.\n\niTunes (desktop)\nAs with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.\n\nThe iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.\n\nThe iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).\nMail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.\n\nSafari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.\n\nThe Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.\n\nPhotos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configuration\n\nThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.\n\nApp Store\nAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.\n\nI did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.\n\nDedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.\n\nSDK\nThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).\n\nAll in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.\n\nPros\n- drop-dead beautiful device\n- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability\n- App store\n- incredibly long battery life\n- unbelievably crisp screen\n- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)\n- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)\n- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size\n- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)\n- SDK\n\nCons\n- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support\n- 64 GB limit\n- battery built in\n- no Adobe Flash support in Safari\n- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching\n- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)\n- single-user mode only\n- no printing\n- worst filesharing ever\n- screen glare\n- must sync to iTunes;Great device, some seriously rough edges

TV shows I miss, pbs for the kids), but there is so much out there that Apple doesn't support (ex. - adobe flash player, which is used by tons of sites).  So, even though the show is out there on the broadcasting company website for free, I can't view it on this VERY expensive device unless there is an ""app"" available.  (Not to mention what a headache having to download all these apps when I should be able to use a general player to view all the content.).

Call me old fashioned but I really need to have functionality. I installed my favorite PC games, Firefox, and MS Office -that's all I need!\n\nIf you want to buy an IPad be sure there is a good return policy. Beleive me, it is love at first site, but after the honeymoon I wanted a divorce. I am hopeful that Apple can pull this off eventually.

77;124.0;5.0;10.0;"Update: We just went through the first big software update to the iPad and various issues have been corrected.  The chief one is multi-tasking.  I can now click the home button twice and a bar will appear which lets me choose other functions.  I choose one and my screen is visibly swiped for another.  Also, internet radio, like my Pandora app, will now continue to play if you leave to use another function of the iPad.  Prior to this, the music stopped playing when you left Pandora.  I now have a mute button on the side and the fix position button is now on the multi-tasking bar.  I've added a few more ereader apps and, as an ebook reader, I use the ipad all of the time.  It is as good for magazines and full color art books as it is for text books.  I have not discovered any downside to this update yet.  It of course still does not play Flash but I don't think that will change as Apple is opposed to Flash. My original review appears below:\n\nI use this every day and all day long.  I read all of my books on it.  I watch tv shows and movies on it--I have not turned on a tv set since the day it arrived. I listen to audios on it. I have no problem using the virtual keyboard and can write my emails just fine on it.  I look at my Picasa albums on it. I listen to audiobooks and music on it.  I surf the web.  Then there are the apps....oh, boy...the apps are something to get lost in.  I play scrabble against the computer on it, ditto gin rummy.  I play my crosswords on it and it downloads all of my New York Times ones. I have art history apps so watched art ones, beautiful images, while waiting for a nerve wracking CT scan.  In fact, I get so absorbed in my iPad that I am somewhat irritated when ""tourists"" want to bother me and ask me what it is and what I'm doing on it. However, my natural enthusiasm takes over and I find myself showing them all of the things I am doing on it.\n\nMy husband got one after he watched me with mine for a few months.  He gets lost in it for hours every evening.  He has a few quibbles about the iPad.  His biggest one is that it doesn't play Flash.  However, I think his problem is that he doesn't realize that if he used Apps properly that he wouldn't even have a need for Flash.  I certainly don't.  I don't need it for my Crosswords, for example, because my App handles all of my crosswords brilliantly.\n\nWhen I listen to all the complaints about the iPad, I think it boils down to that somehow the iPad is not the macbook in iPad form.  I don't need another Macbook!  I have a macbook, an iPad and an iPhone and frankly there is nothing else I need.  What one may not do best, the other does.  At home, where I spend most of my time, I am surrounded by all three.  When I go out, I take the iPad and iPhone.  I used to take the Macbook too but that is rarely necessary anymore. Once you have these three products, you can junk the rest of your electronics.  I certainly did.

94;128.0;4.0;10.0;"I've had my iPad since sometime in June. When I first bought it, I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, and for the first month or so it languished, just a huge version of my beloved iPod Touch. Too heavy to use as an e-reader. I love the keyboard but not for writing long or multiple emails. And then slowly over time I started to find uses for it, until at this point I would miss it very  much if I didn't have it. It's a tedious process to find the apps that you want and will use, but it's worth taking the time to search. Everything looks so good on this thing! I keep it by my bedside and use it as a quick reference device after the primary computer has been put to sleep in the living room. I have a super weather app. I am not a big game player but I found several that are fun and the iPad makes them very portable. I put episodes of TV shows that I like on it and watch when I am camping and it's raining outside (again, HD is gorgeous on it). I have a musical app that's interesting (Beatwave), and two drawing apps (Uzu and LineArt). I have a bird ID app in it and one that plays bird songs for identification. I know that there are those who use it for business; if that's your plan, this review is not for you.

I didn't want to spend a fortune on either the device or internet access, but it had to have mobile access not just wi-fi. I checked a variety of devices and settled for a cheap netbook and data plan from verizon that has worked great. I use it almost like I would my pc at home everywhere I go, and also use it as an e-reader. I will spend approximatedly $25.00 a month over the next 2 years counting the device and the data access(i live in a area where I can get free wi-fi most of the time). I calculated that I would spend about $60 a month minimum for the ipad and a data plan AND IT WON'T DO AS MUCH AS MY NETBOOK!!!!\n\nJust as an aside when I was looking at the Ipad in the Apple Store I would have to say that almost the whole crowd consisted of giggling girls and dorky boys of all ages.

For that, with its great screen and 10 hour battery life, it is fabulous. You'd have to spend at least $500 to get netbook computer with comparable battery life and graphics power, but miss out on the touch screen and portrait mode.\n\nMy problem is that I cannot sync the Ipad to my computer. I have an iPhone too and was able sync that until the iTunes release 9.1 that coincided with the release of the iPad. When I try to sync either device, the message ""Unable to load data class information from sync services"" appears in iTunes. I have spent more than 16 hours on the phone with at least ten Apple support techs, at the ""Genius Bar"" in my local Apple store, and on my own trying various ""fixes"" posted on the web. The senior Apple tech I am now dealing with tells me he has the same problem trying to sync his iPhone to his own computer. I briefly found a work around and was able to sync for a day, but then when I installed iTunes 9.2, it stopped working again. You cannot roll back to a previous version of iTunes because 9.1 changed the library file structure.\n\nI just spent two hours emailing myself 150 mbs of pdf doucments that I need to read, opening them on the iPad and then saving them in iBooks. If I could sync, that would have been taken me five minutes of effort at most. I also cannot load music or photos from my computer library.\n\nThis problem with iTunes seems to be affecting a lot of people according the Apple techs I've dealt with and the web forums I've read. If you are planning to buy an iPad, make sure you can sync it to your computer before you buy it. Install iTunes and take your laptop down to your local retailer and ask them sync it to a demo iPad in the store. Otherwise, you may end up like me.\n\nSo far, my experience has been ugly and stressful. It's disgraceful that in Apple's rush to get this product to market, they wrecked the iTunes sync capability for thousands of customers and tens weeks later they still have not fixed it.";Great device, but beware that sync to computer may not work
144;133.0;5.0;10.0;Ive had both Kindle 1 and 2, and the 'Pad as I call it, blows them away with reading.  iBooks has adjustable brightness, so it is every bit as easy on the eyes when done right.  I am now reading all the time!  Reading is the tip of the iceberg though, the Apps make this thing soooo awesome!;Lifechanging Product
151;134.0;5.0;10.0;"One of my favorite things about being an early adopter is when I pick up a device more for the novelty than anything else and I'm completely surprised by how useful it turns out to be. I had this experience first with my first iPod, when I discovered podcasts. I had it again when I first got a Kindle and my reading increased about 5 fold. And I've had it once more, in almost too many ways to count, with the iPad.\n\nLet me be clear, the iPad is not a computer. You can't do anything on it that you couldn't on a laptop or desktop PC. The difference with the iPad though, is that you'll find it allows you to many of those things in ways and places you would never bring a PC to. Let me give a few examples to better illustrate my point.\n\nA few days after I got my iPad, I discovered that it fit nearly perfectly on the reading ledge for my treadmill. Now my treadmill faces a blank wall, so up to this point workout entertainment has been strictly auditory. With the iPad though, I can now watch videos while I work out. The result, I've been exercising about twice as often in the three weeks since I bought my iPad.\n\nAnother example. I used to love reading comics when I was younger. However, as an adult there's a certain stigma attached to having a comic book collection in the house. The Marvel and Xcomics apps on the iPad mean that I can now enjoy comics without actually having to keep them laying around my house. The result is that I've completely rediscovered a form of entertainment.\n\nOne more example. The other night, while getting ready for bed with my wife, somehow the topic of old cartoon theme songs came up in conversation. I picked up the iPad from my nightstand and we spent about 30 minutes reminiscing over YouTube clips of old cartoons. Now you might say I could do the same thing with a laptop, which I could. However, my laptop wasn't in the room and it's unlikely I would have gone to fetch it simply on a whim. With a 4-5lb laptop, it more or less stays in one place unless I anticipate that there will be a need for it. With a 1.5lb iPad, it follows me wherever I go, almost always nearby should the need for it arise.\n\nThose are just 3 examples of how the iPad has proved useful in the short time I've had it. True, they're small things, but they add up quickly to form a completely different experience with a computing device than what I'm used to.\n\nSure the device is not without its flaws. Flash would definitely be welcome. And I'd kill for a USB and SD slot. But the technical story of this device doesn't have a whole lot to do with what makes the experience of using it so special. It's a completely different computing experience, and trying to boil it down to a spec sheet comparison just doesn't do it justice.\n\nUpdate: I want to add a few of my thoughts on how the iPad compares to the Kindle as an ebook reader, since it seems particularly pertinent in an Amazon review.  I've been using the Kindle app on the iPad for a little while now, and I've reached a point where I'm using each device in more or less equal amounts for reading.  Overall, I think I prefer using the Kindle.  The screen is easier on the eyes; the battery life is significantly better; the size and weight feel better in my hand; and size of the iPad's screen just feels a bit too large for reading large portions of text.\n\nThat said, the iPad is certainly a capable reader in the right circumstances.  In particular, I use it more than the Kindle when I'm in bed at night because the back-lit screen means I don't need a reading light that will keep my wife awake.  Also, I've been using it more often when starting a new book.  Navigation of the store is much easier and downloads go much faster than on the Kindle due to the WiFi.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm certainly not going to get rid of my Kindle now that I've got an iPad.  There are simply too many situations where I prefer it over the iPad for reading.  That said, if I didn't already own a Kindle, I think it would be much harder to justify buying one as well as an iPad, since the iPad does serve as a capable ebook reader in most circumstances.";Surprisingly Versatile
153;135.0;4.0;10.0;"I've had the iPad for about a month now, so I've had some time to play around with it.\n\nFirst off - the device is NICE looking. Much like a giant iPhone/iPod Touch, and in fact, if the iPod Touch had 3G and was 4x the size, I don't think you could tell the difference.\n\nThe device shares the same OS (or a slight variation of it) and most of the iPhone/iPod Touches built in apps (although some are slightly modified such as Mail and Contacts to better fit the large screen).\n\nA great touch is that it runs MOST of the iPhone apps. Most? not all?? No -- some apps (I've figured out the hard way) are designed for iPhone only and will simply NOT WORK on the iPad. Be sure to check apps ahead of time to avoid disappointment! Emulation is decent, giving the option of either ""boxing"" around a 100% sized screen or ""2x doubling"" which fills the iPad screen. You either get the best quality at a lower size, or a full screen at a lower quality - a poor tradeoff (also, running iPhone apps at 4x their intended size looks very odd in some cases -- skype turns the iPad into a 10"" phone display that looks like one of those joke remote controls they sell with the 4"" buttons). iPad apps make much better used of the available space, but so far those apps are behind the iPhone counterparts that have been in development for years (and usually cost a bit more!).\n\nOne big disappointment of running iPhone apps on the iPad are that they don't run the same! Photo editing apps, for example, save all photos at 640x480 on the iPad (but full resolution even on the original iPhone 2G). To edit photos and keep them at full resolution you need to use iPad specific apps (which again are not up to the point of iPhone apps).\n\nMuch like the iPhone, almost everything needs to be done through iTunes (transferring movies and music, updating, syncing), so those of you who hate the program will need to just suck it  up for this one (even on my newer quad-core PC iTunes is a big resource hog, so I understand the pain!).\n\nThe 3 sizes available (16GB, 32GB and 64GB) are before formatting - you get about 59GB usable on the 64GB model (which is expected if you've ever purchased a hard drive). Unfortunately there isn't any other storage option available, so if you buy 16GB and need more you'll need to delete stuff to free space.\n\nOverall speed of the product is very nice - I only have the original iPhone (2G) and with all of the updates over the last couple years it's really slowed it down. The iPad is blazing fast now, but I wonder how long it'll be before OS updates slow it down and you need the the 2nd generation iPad to get that speed back. Also, a big problem with the iPod Touch are that updates cost between $5-10. Will the same hold true for the iPad?\n\nThe device is great for movies.. sometimes. It's closer to a 4:3 (fullscreen) aspect ratio than the iPhone (widescreen) so widescreen movies WILL display black bars (and those 2.40:1 movies like the Matrix will be mostly black bars). Movies will also quickly fill the iPad (coming in around 1.5 - 2.5GB a piece).\n\nSound is a bit better than the iPhone, but still in a very poor position (one speaker, located at the bottom right of the iPad) - You'll want headphones for this thing.\n\nWifi is nice, but what about away from the house? the option to even get 3G is another $129. On top of that you need to purchase a monthly plan (fortunately no contract!). Unfortunately, just a month or so after release, ATT has killed the option for Unlimited 3G and replaced it with a 2GB cap (you also have a 250MB plan available for a few bucks less). People who purchase the iPad by 6/7/2010 will be able to purchase the Unlimited plan but will only have the 250MB/2GB plan available if they cancel the unlimited plan and want to sign up again).\n\nA big disappointment are the included accessories. You'd expect something to come with it for the outrageous price it costs, right? No case, no dock, no headphones. Just a USB cable and wall adapter. Expect to cough up way more than necessary for a dock, headphones, case, etc..

No more booting up the PC or bringing the laptop out of standby. The iPad is 'always on' and just takes a click to use it. That's the big selling point for me. The downside is that you lose all other functionality of a PC and have to resort to using available apps (more $$).\n\nA bit selling point for me was the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPad-Camera-Connection-Kit/dp/B003K1EYM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit</a>&nbsp;- being able to plug my DSLR into it, download photos, edit them using iPad apps and then upload them to flickr from anywhere! Problem is, the kit is more $$ (why not just add a USB slot to the thing?), the memory card adapter is SD only (not the popular Compact Flash found in DSLRs, so those people (myself) will need to plug a USB cable from the camera to the iPad camera kit to the iPad to download photos). More stuff to carry around!\n\nThere are some very cool apps on it - I love being able to hold movies on a larger device than an iPhone. I love being able to put all my photos on there. I love being able to browse the web from anywhere. For that, I give it 4 stars.\n\nA couple last disappointments - the things a bit heavy (1.5LBs) and hard to angle anywhere. Trying to watch a movie and hold it isn't fun, and the stands aren't perfect (or usable in all situations). It's also big -- a little too big! Unlike an iPhone which can always be in your pocket, this thing needs its own bag that you have to bring with you.\n\nIt's much like cameras -- a Point & shoot gets the job done and can go with you everywhere. A DSLR does a much better job, but being so bulky you can't take it with you all the time.";Review of 3G + 64GB Model
182;136.0;2.0;10.0;Now I'll admit I don't own one, just played with it at a store. I own an Iphone so am familiar with general approach. The Ipad is a great device, and I applaud it, but here's why I hesitate to buy one, unless just for an ereader device (and these things were amazingly not mentioned in the leading negative review)\n-I cant back up my Iphone onto it. I can on a netbook. duh\n-I cant backup my camera chip on it. Can on netbook.\n-netbook runs photographic editing sware (picasa - free from Google)\n-netbook has usb ports\n-netbook baterry lasts 10 hours.\n-netbook costs $300 with 160-250 gb hd mem\n-netbook has keyboard and office sw\n\nWith that kind of competition, I think Apple has to carefully position themselves as an ereader.\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nadded 8/4\ni bought one, and above comments are true. it also doesnt print, you gotta email or sync the file to your Mac/Pc  and print from there.\n\nI like the gizmo, though. Its just that the reader should br aware this is a beta, rushed product whose main advantage is its a tablet with nice form factor. ,I reach for my ipad over my laptop every time.;I hate to give it 2 stars, but
201;137.0;1.0;10.0;"Like all other Apple products, I have never been impressed with them and their price schemes are too high.  Never been one of those that believe in ""techno-hype"".  I stick with what works and what provides the most support and what will be around.  Despite my dislike for Microsoft, I love the stability of the operating environment and the familiarity of its technology.";Not Impressed
204;138.0;5.0;10.0;"As with many Apple products, the form factor of the iPad is amazing and what is does, it does incredibly well. There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!\n\nWhat really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.\n\nI read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.\n\nSure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.\n\nThe iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.\n\nUPDATE MAY 14, 2010:\n\nFrom several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:\n\nPros:\n\n -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it!\n -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure.\n -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games.\n -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper.\n -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system.\n -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.\n\nCons:\n -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them.\n -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking ""Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99.""  Believe me, they add up!\n -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a ""go back to your previous app"" button.\n -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it.\n -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.  Takes practice and a good aim!";It's all about the Apps and the Speed

216;140.0;4.0;10.0;"FIRST, THIS IS A PERSONAL  ""USE"" REVIEW.  IT IS NOT A ""SPECS"" REVIEW. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ""SPECS"" REVIEW, THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR YOU.  THERE ARE A LOT OUT THERE.\n\nHaving said that, ..........I love my IPAD!!!!!!\nIt is so much smaller than a notebook and so much thinner than a netbook.\n\nOn top of that, I use my iPad alot for web surfing, emailing, watching movies, and reading while on the elliptical at the gym.  Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.\n\nNo other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone.\nI'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!\n\nAlso, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.\n\nPeople who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. I\njust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.\n\nAlso, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison.\n\n On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close to\nipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.\n\nSure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.\n\nSo, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having said\nthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.";Best for workouts on elliptical and More

I guess that's what they call revenge when you detect a spammer and tell all the people about him.\n\nIn any case, a spammer is always a spammer and I will contact amazon to see how did they allow him to leave me feedback on my seller account which has been in active for 5 years!!!!";beware of this seller (pda6dotcom)
39;142.0;2.0;9.0;I have owned the iPad 32GB 3G version of the iPad since April 2010.  Why is this an incomplete piece of technology?  1) Unreliable Apps plague this unit and my iPad has been rendered useless by software glitches.  Goodluck deleting these rogue programs when they malfunction.  Unless it successfully downloaded or you have direct access to your home computer, you will not be able to remove these programs.  As a result when using 3G service you will not be able to acccess data on the internet because these programs are hogging up the data stream.  Internet access is totally unreliable.  2) AT$T has the worst service I have ever had to use.  I am constantly being dropped from the internet or many times I am unable to access at all.  Constantly unable to access the internet with 3G.  Until Apple drops AT&T, I would delay my purchase of the iPad 3G.  Verizon is now available and it is much better. 3)The newest OS is not much better.  Good luck printing with a wireless network that shares PC's. It only works with select wireless printers. All fluff no substance. 4) No flash player.  I was surprised just how many websites I was not able to access for lack of flash compatibility.  You might not mind this, but when researching or accessing educational websites I find that many of these data sources are not usable with the iPad.  Do not waste your money on the 3G version, it has way too many flaws.;Big iPhone, Incomplete Technology at Best
53;143.0;5.0;9.0;"What do i have to offer to the already 432 previous reviews?  Just - thank you guys!\n\ni'm a 52 year old male who grew up in a world without computers.  I don't thiink that i like them, but i know they keep creeping into my life as a marginal neccessity.\n\nAlong comes this ipad thing. Fast, crisp, smooth operating (computer ?) pad.  yes it is a computer.  i can balance my checking accounts.  surf the web, email, chat, oh no even play games. thats gotta be a computer.  no viral worries.  no rebooting.  no defragmenting.  it works fantastic - and i just sit back and take all the credit.  You macsters really knew how to cater to the millions of  middle age guys who are not 22 year old computer whizzezzzzz.\n\nAddendum 01/01/11:  FYI we used to have a Sony Vaio PC.  The wife and kids ""needed"" it for their various life fulfilling projects.  Every week there would be some sort of drama surrounding its existance;  update the reader, update security,  10 minute download,  file this file that and forget it.  Now this iPad fills practically every need I have with no drama.  I need ice skates to keep up with its speed and ease.\n\nOH sure if your accounting or running your business you NEED a monstosity computer.  But i bet for most of us this is all you really need to be connected to the world in all the electronic ways.";Good Job Mac Boyz
68;144.0;3.0;9.0;First, the good:\n - It's nicely responsive most of the time\n - has a good selection of apps\n - the touch interface is fantastic.\n - It's my go-to device for quick web-surfing, kindle reading, etc.\n - Individual apps are often unstable, but the OS itself is quick solid.\n\nThe bad:\n - iTunes for PC is without a doubt the most bug-ridden POS my computer has ever been saddled with.  Every other app is rock solid but this one.  It's also slow, confusing yet primitive, and crashes and errors constantly.  I cannot gripe about this enough.  Unless you are running a mac, steer clear of this product!\n - Very slow web-browsing speed compared to even the lowest end laptops.  Total lack of caching means flipping back a page forces a reload of the page from the web.  Slows things down further.\n - Lack of flash hurts more than I expected\n - Slow wifi makes streaming video watching a crapshoot.  Sometimes works great, other times abysmal\n - Touch interface not so great for content-creation of any kind\n\nBottom Line:\nGood for content consumption, not so good for content creation.  Can't currently replace a real computer.  If they would remove iTunes from the picture and fix the sub-par web browsing this would be a nice little device.;Mixed bag
89;145.0;3.0;9.0;I bought iPad for basic browsing at home and am VERY disappointed that I cannot open a lot of websites because Apple would not support Adobe Flash. What a shame!;Why no Flash support?
101;146.0;2.0;9.0;I bought the product at Best Buy and had it for about a week.  In the store, it seemed so sleek and sexy that I didn't pay attention to its major downfall.  Namely its sleek and sexy without substance.  While you get 10 hours of battery life, you are stuck with the battery because it can not be replaced.  What happens in a year or two when it only gets 8 hours of life and then less and less.  Essentially you get a giant ipod touch that can not be taken apart, upgraded, or have any other modification done to it (not really a computer in my book).  No peripherals such as a USB input or any other way of connecting to anything other than another computer (which by the way you will need to sync or even start the thing initially) unless you want to fork over more money.  At first, the on screen keyboard was OK but progressively, I realized that it was next to impossible to write even moderate sized emails in any span of time consistent with a modern lifestyle.  Nor can you do any sort of actual work on the thing: no multitasking and when I attempted to work on a couple of google docs it toke me forever to make even small changes.  Some counter that you can just get the additional keyboard dock but that's another $80 and isn't practical for everybody to carry around.  While I very much enjoyed web browsing in the touch screen format, I must admit that it was a different web.  Without Flash support, many of the sites I normally visited were not the same.\n\nNow for the good parts: it is really fun to use for media consumption, playing games, reading (inside not outside), and it makes people jealous that you own it.  Also, the app store are releasing many really innovative apps for the iPad.  After a week, these pluses were not enough to outweigh all the minuses above and I returned it.  I think the next generation of iPads may improve on these points but if they don't, I foresee netbook/tablet hybrids kicking the poop out of this product in the long run.;Flawed with flair
108;147.0;5.0;9.0;"I have never used an Apple Product before.  I am a software engineer but have never worked on a MAC. I was looking for a device to read text books in pdf format. I was looking for a device with at least 9.7"" display. The Plastic Logic device doesn't seem to be coming out any time soon and I wasn't sure about the Iliad. I was on the edge  between the Kindle DX and the Ipad. I checked out the ipad and looked at some pdf's and was concerned about the display size, practicality of zooming in every time and prolonged reading on a back lit screen.\nAfter much deliberation (and research) I bought the Ipad. I unpacked the box at around 4pm. I couldn't put down the device until 2 am! It took all of 5 minutes to connect to my 802.11B Linksys router (it negotiates the WEP/WAP, key number and simply expected the Password/Key that I had used for security). I have worked on many high end LCD monitors but I have never seen a display so plush! My jaw literally dropped when I saw Magazine covers on zino (its a free app). The choice of applications on iTunes is mind boggling. At first I was sceptical about watching movies at this size. But the Netflix app rendering is so smooth, I felt like I was watching at 1080p on some high end SONY Bravia. Wall Street Journal , although expensive, is laid out so well that if other papers followed suit, it will bring the demise of their physical circulation immediately.\nBattery life is another thing that is so surprising. I had the device on, almost constantly, for almost 10 hours, and the level fell barely to 80%.\nFinally what really blew me away, is the finger swipe movement. I have never used an Ipod touch or Iphone before, so this was new to me. It is extraordinarily accurate and smooth and beats 20 years of Mouse development! The virtual keyboard is perfectly sensitive.\n\nOh, and yes, I downloaded the GoodReader app and finally got around to reading my pdf text books. The screen is a bit small for reading text books with tables and network diagrams, but the pdf reader has a great margin-crop feature. Using this feature in landscape mode, with constant zoom, reading the most complex pdf becomes a breeze. The screen is so sharp and bright that eye strain is minimal.\n\nThis is definitely the Ferrari of electronic devices.";Lush display and sleek, extremely chic
118;148.0;4.0;9.0;I purchased my iPad for business travel hoping that I could comfortably and easily use it for e-mails, web surfing, watching movies and more. This is a really nice piece of hardware with an excellent design. The touch screen works easily and almost flawlessly. The virtual keyboard is fast and very effective. The display is very pleasing, particularly when playing movies. WiFi operation in my situation was very robust and basically transparent. The iPad is very light and easy to tote around initially. The bundled apps are sufficient for basic computing.\nOn the demerit side, the first issue is that watching movies requires a stand of some sort which leads to a marketplace with solutions that are either expensive, heavy, wobbly or cheesy or all four (and not ideal for travel). I know that there is a cardboard origami solution but I didn't want to deal with that for every trip. The next issue is that it really isn't very comfortable holding the bare iPad for a long time and one worries about scratching the beautiful aluminum case. This leads to a search for a skin or case. I ended up with the InCase Silicone skin which has a very good design that levels out the back of the iPad with molded rubber protrusions. Unfortunately, this also almost doubles the weight of the iPad, negating its weight advantage for travel and lounging around with it. Next, integration with iTunes and a lack of a USB port leaves the iPad user chained to Apple solutions for data transfers with the exception of the camera connection kit. I am in a mixed OS household (Windows and Mac) and this created potential hassles that I didn't want to deal with. Finally, I was surprised by how many mainstream web sites that I went to that were inaccessible because of Flash (and despite Mr. Jobs' assurances otherwise). I returned my iPad after three days. I am sure however, that for many, this will fit the bill either as a third device or for those with the narrow requirements that this device meets.;Not this Goldilocks' tablet yet...
130;149.0;2.0;9.0;"When it works, it's pretty cool. (64GB Wifi)\n\nHere are the issues I've had after approx. 8 weeks of ownership.\n\nPDF's - if your trying to view a pdf catalog or something else heavy on color images, it either won't display and quits the program, or it displays without the images and sometimes character formatting is off.  I've purchased 5 different PDF readers, tried a couple of free ones, and tried iBooks.  No dice, must all be using the same SDK routines or something.  So for large pdf files with images, it's not there yet.  Small pdf's with few images work great.\n\nWireless - The wireless is a joke.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Constantly having to go into settings to re-establish network connection.  Then when it is working, don't get too far from your access point or the thing get's schizophrenic.  Signal strength will drop from full to 1 bar without moving, and when it's on 1 bar the wireless speed crawls.  Also, rotating from portrait mode to landscape usually, in my experience, has a negative impact on signal strength/connection.\n\nHang ups - If you use it a lot and switch between a lot of different apps, it will just hang up where only the first page of icons will respond to your touch.  Which is good because that is where you get into ""settings"" to reset the device.  This fixes it, but it is just a matter of time before it happens again.  I think this may be linked with the wireless issues.\n\nLack of Flash support - Now, I knew beforehand that it didn't support flash, and didn't think it would be a big deal.  But, there are a lot of sites and things using flash that I didn't realize were, I guess.  This has really hamstrung this device.  Many sites I go to apparently are more flash heavy than I thought and means as a web surfing tool the iPad is quite limited for my uses.\n\nScreen smudges - due to all the finger gestures to navigate, you end up with smear marks all over the screen from the natural oil in you skin.  Since, one of the primary things I bought this for was it's bookreading ability, I find it annoying that I have to clean the screen frequently, because the text is blurry from all the smudge marks on the screen.\n\nScreen reflectiveness - The screen is glossy, and (especially when clean), you can see reflections of windows and lights.  I find this distracting, and causing me to constantly reposition the device to minimize glare.  At nighttime with the light down, this is not an issue.  I do have a lot of large windows and a crazy number of recessed lights in my house, so this may be part of the problem.\n\nI think the device is a neat concept, and if the freezing/unresponsive icons and wireless issues get sorted out, along with flash support, it would be a premiere web surfing/email/entertainment device.  As a bookreader, the pdf support is better than the e-ink readers, but due to smudge marks and the backlit screen, I personally find it tiring on the eyes after 45 minutes or so of use.  I also bought it to try to get around printing out huge pdf electronics catalogs and pdf technical docs.  It is really hit or miss in this area, depending on file size and amount of embedded images/drawings.\n\nHopefully some of the above issues will get worked out as the product OS and firmware matures.";Still a beta product ???
140;150.0;5.0;9.0;I bought two iPads for my wedding anniversary--something my wife and I can have like a his/hers thing, LOL.  I didn't leap at getting the iPad or for any other Apple product-- I was very skeptical and closely gathered what information was available to me and what I wanted out of an e-reader (since my first consideration was getting Kindles.)  What did it for me was that the Kindle DX, the most expensive one, was about $60 less than the cheapest iPad--shame on you, Amazon.  Obviously the iPad could do way more than just contain e-books, so I went with it.\n\nI broke the piggy bank getting them but I haven't regretted it--our iPads have definitely made their own niche in the way my wife and I read books, watch movies and surf the Internet.  As a portable media device it's wonderful--I've taken it on long flights (8 hours)and watched movies and read a few e-books I purchased.  I have yet to have any problems with how long it lasts on a charge.  The display is very crisp and shines best when you're watching videos on it.  For the fingerprints, I have a large lint free cloth I carry with it to wipe it down--those fingerprints do stand out when the display is off.  I use it daily to read the news and browse casually and comfortably anywhere in my home. My job involves continuous review of technical data and publications--I have them loaded to my iPad and read them with ease.  My wife also loves using it to play music from her library while she browses online.  Is it a laptop replacement?  Definitely not.  It seems cumbersome to try to prepare a presentation, create a long note or document on this thing without giving up and reaching for your laptop.  It seems it's no better than trying to do the same on your smartphone, unless you had the keyboard which I hadn't purchased.  For everything that others claim the iPad comes short on, my netbook has it (ie webcam, usb) so I'm not worried about it.\n\nPlease believe me when I tell you this device is in a place of its own--not quite the laptop, but a very versatile reading/ media tool. We've owned ours for about two months now, and we love them.\n\nUPDATE 25 MAR 2011\nIt's been about a year since my wife and I purchased our iPads and I can tell you that I hate to sound cliche, but it has changed my life.  It's my newspaper (USA Today, CNN.) When I go to college online it's my notebook (Notes Plus.) At work it's my publications library that I'm required to reference often (PDF Expert/iAnnotate.) Before I had my iPad, I had a few critical publications in print, but I could only reference my electronic pubs at home or on my laptop.  Now they're all with me wherever I go and coworkers and bosses often ask me questions I can pull up quickly on my iPad with a reference.  And last but not least, it's my personal library (Kindle) and my Bible (OliveTree Bible Reader.)  To my wife, it's her ultra portable Internet browser and a library of interactive kids books for our daughter.  It's in a niche of its own.  I'm not sure if playing with it in the Apple Store would do it justice, since like an iPhone an iPad has to be app-tailored by its owner .  I know it's not a fancy as the 2nd Gen iPad with the cameras, but I'm very happy with mine and I probably won't replace it until it gives out on me.  It's the best portable electronic tool I have ever owned to date.  I know there are other media tables that have tried to compete, but honestly I don't think anything can come close whether some people like Apple or not--the iPad is it!;After a Year, Still in Love...

168;152.0;5.0;9.0;I have had the Ipad 64g 3G for a little over two week and I'm still just as addicted to it as I was the first day. I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi but I recommend spending a little more for the iPad 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t. The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book. Like it or not the iPad is a revolution and created a whole new device category and will do for tablets what the ipod and iphone did for mp3 players and cell phones.;iPad will make your life easier and keep you entertained non stop,
209;153.0;4.0;9.0;"For a very long time I have played with portable devices, trying to get one that met my needs. I tried the Pocket PC, Palm Pilot, cellphones, and nothing quite satisfied my needs. In general, I wanted a light weight, easy to carry device that would enable me to search the web and read pdf/word/powerpoint/ and  excel documents. I was also looking for something to store my address book and a calender for scheduling and to do list.\n\nDespite popular belief, the ipad is in no way a tablet PC. As a matter of fact, it is basically an ipod touch with a larger screen and slightly more powerful processor. Understanding that, you can decide whether this is really the device you wanted. In my case, it absolutely was. I have no ipod touch, so I did not have that feeling of repetition when purchasing this item. I have enjoyed the ipad, and while I initially felt some pangs of buyer's remorse, the longer I have it, the more I have enjoyed it.\n\nWhen purchasing the ipad, you probably should plan to spend some $50 on additional applications. Apps are not too expense, but you may want 5-10 applications to help you get what you want out of the ipad. One bonus, most ipod touch games work with the ipad, so you have access to all of those games and software. Unfortunately, one of my biggest reasons for wanting the ipad was to have a portable office. So far, I have yet to find any software (free or buyable, that really provided me with the office I wanted. The closest program so far has yet to be ported to the ipad, and the ipod version does not work correctly. On the other hand, the ipad brings a new feel to gaming. It is unique, fun, and enjoyable. I enjoy the gaming on this far better than the nintendo DS (stylus) gaming. It is fun, and there are hundred's of games for both the ipad and ipod touch to keep you busy for a long long time.\n\nIn the end, I am someone who wanted an ipod touch, but with a larger screen, and I got it. I didn't care for an mp3 player (I have one). So I basically wanted a palm pilot with a large enough screen to be able to surf the web and read pdf's comfortably, and that is exactly what it is. Trying to make it more is what leads to disappointment and the lower score others are giving it. It is not fit in your pocket portable, but if it was, then you wouldn't be able to read and use the web comfortably. It is portable enough for me to take along in the car on long drives, take to a friends house, bring along on vacation, and do all the things with it that I would need on the go, without the need for a bulky keyboard or an inconvenient stylus, but I wouldn't ""drag it everywhere with me"", since it is too inconvenient for that.\n\nIt is a 4 out of 5 because although I like it, it is lacking a couple of things that I think are no brainers. Some of them you can download at a cost, but I just would have expected them to come with the device free, such as a viewer and editor for .doc and .xls documents (word and excel), and a to do list. (seriously, you have to buy and download a to do list, they couldn't just give you one for free). If there are so many free widgets and gadgets out there, then why do ipad apps, which do no more or less than a widget of similar ability, have to cost $2-$5 each?\n\nUpdate: I figured I should reiterate what I mean with the portable office and my score. Yes, they offer ""pages"" and ""numbers"" at a cost of $9.99 each, but besides costing $30 to get all of the software needed (powerpoint, word, excel equivalents), they also limit the fonts used and are not the software I would choose. I would have expected at least a free viewer to be able to look at these files, but you have to spend money on that (good reader is what I purchased). For a device centered around the idea of being a very slick and portable itablet, they didn't put any effort to ensure it could do what an actually itablet computer can do. They should have thought of making a document viewer and editor come with it with limited features. Eventually, companies will come out with them, and I will purchase them at a cost of $10-$15 when a decent one does, but it is something almost required on this kind of device, but absent. There desire to nickel and dime customers with there apps is incredibly apparent, almost every free app either has ads, or tries to get you to buy their paid for version. Many of the free games constantly tries to get you to make ""ingame"" purchases. And seeing how easy it is to make a purchase once setting it up, definitely make sure you kid doesn't touch it or you could end up with a $200 bill easy. So Apple Ipad gets a 4, because for all its' potential, apple limits you so it can get every penny out of you it can.";Good Product, No Buyer's Remorse
14;154.0;1.0;6.0;It is out of date and I did not realize this about the I pads. I cannot get facebook or face time because the app cannot be applied to this version of i pad. Major bummer;Very dissatisfied with this product
15;155.0;5.0;6.0;I was in total shock when I opened my used ipad I ordered for my 10 year old son for Christmas!!!! It was like I went to the store and bought it brand new... I was so happy and over joyed when I saw the condition it was in....I will never buy a new electronic device again... I will only order it from this Amazon seller and thank you so much for keeping this product in the condition it is... I appreciate people that take good care of their products. I can't explain how happy my son is going to be when he receives this on Christmas morning... I have tears of joy right now just expressing to you of how thankful I am.....We would of never been able to afford a brand new one for our son....It's just like brand new. Thanks again, Cassie;Impeccable condition of our new ipad!!!!!
36;156.0;2.0;8.0;"I finally drank the Apple Kool-Aid! I got my long awaited 16GB iPad 2 days ago. A item I have been drooling over for several months. (I didn't buy it from Amazon.) It is a nice device for sure, but has one glaring, major flaw. Lack of any Flash support.\n\nThis is marketed as primarily an internet device. This is the device that they tout in their video as ""Holding the web in your hand."" Well yeah, as long as you don't want to see anything move.."" I guess they were afraid you might get startled & drop it.\n\nIt's almost impossible to land on any website that doesn't have a flash powered section. Most Videos: Forget it! Internet Radio: Forget it! Website animations: Forget it! What the heck were they thinking, crippling this otherwise fine device by not making it Flash compatible? I bought the Skyfire browser from the app store. It is supposed to support the loading (translating)of flash videos, but so far I have not tried one website that it works on. And it is loaded with ads & random opening of unrequested websites. Well, what's another $4 when you already blew $500....\n\nThe iPad web performance is slow in general. I have read the new OS - which mine has did slow the machine down.\n\nThe iBooks reader is nice, and the GUI is smooth as butter and beautiful. I had issues when setting up my iTunes that turned into a chore. (I have 4 PCs that have iTunes, BTW. - So not unfamiliar with it..) By the time I gave up on ever seeing a Flash video again & getting the iTunes working I was starting to notice a startling similarity to my ""Lost Linux Year.""\n\n(BTW: There is a YouTube app, so you can view YouTube videos.)\n\nAlso, this will not charge at any reasonable rate from a USB port on most Windows PC's. You will need a Mac (higher voltage USB)or a separate ""Genuine Apple Charger."" Steve will be happy to sell you one for $29.(Plus tax & shipping.)\n\nIn summary I am not impressed. The touchscreen tablet is a nice idea, but if this is as good as it gets - I'm going to sell this and go back to a netbook. It looks very nice, the offline apps work well - but web functionally is lacking I.M.H.O. I wouldn't buy another one based on my experience so far.";What No Flash ?? Yes, I'm serious...
41;157.0;5.0;8.0;Received this as a gift (64GB, no 3G) June 2010. It ends up being used a lot by my kids to play games, but also for adults to do web browsing wireless at home using Wi-Fi (wireless-n). Latest OS providing multi-tasking helps a lot.\n\nWe have a case to protect it which is very important. Putting on a protective film layer is 10x harder than on iPhone, due to larger area and chances for more bubbles. I wasted 4 sheets before succeeding.\n\nWith more apps available for home audio / video (Remote app for AppleTV, Air Video), home control, productivity software, Apple AirPlay (play to remote/wireless speakers), and HD quality games, iPad's value to family increases dramatically over time.\n\nAway from home it's good to occupy time in the car. We use Verizon's Mi-Fi card as a way for iPad, iPods, and laptops to share on family trips. This is why we didn't want to get the 3G version.\n\nIt was essential to have 64GB storage, as we put over 200 albums and 15 movies on it so far (with the rest on home server for remote streaming).\n\nI have one major complaint, and that's Apple's intentionally not letting Flash to run (and only do something special with YouTube and selective partner websites). This cut down over 20+ websites that I can enjoy, and many that my kids like to go to for Flash games. I really hope that Adobe and Apple to get things resolved. Skyfire doesn't look promising (on Flash games).;More and more useful everyday
42;158.0;5.0;8.0;"Look, this isn't a laptop. And it changed my life. Just as a laptop probably changed many people's lives in the past, including mine, this little guy really changed a lot.\n\nI'm in college so I needed something to help me stay more organized. Also, I am in a lot of online classes and I needed something to surf the web with. This is perfect. The IPad 32 has just the right amount of memory and just the right amount of features. I bought Pages for it, and it works BETTER than word. My father and I still can't get over the ease of the IPad. While he is on his laptop trying to figure out how to attach a photo in an email, I'm ten steps ahead, laughing while he fumbles with Windows. I love it.\n\nTheir are some draw backs for those people who need ALL features of a laptop. But for me, it;s great. I can upload my photos from my SD card in SECONDS with my Camera Attachment. I can edit home movie with my ReelDirector app. There is just so much. The app world is SO huge and the prices are so small that you don't have to worry about spending too much. And that's the best part, the cost of apps. For example, Pages, the word app, cost me $9.99. Word for instance can cost over $100.00 in a suite. It's just great. If you can afford it, get it.

54;160.0;4.0;8.0;My wife and I both own ipads. She got hers in November and I got mine recently. This device rocks. It reminds me of my Iphone 4 on steroids with a much bigger screen. I started to go blind playing games on my iphone. The ipad seemed like a logical choice. I am very happy with it in most areas. Feels good to the hands, light, easy to tote around. Very easy setup and a breeze to use especially if you have an iphone and or ipod touch. I was using it within minutes right out the box. Web browsing is easy. Very handy for checking e-mail. A ton of programs of course through the Apple app store. So why not 5 stars. There are two things that bother me about this device. It has major issues with downloading games from the ipad app store app. Why that is I don't know. I have tried and least 3 games and ended up just downloading them on my main laptop and syncing. Easy enough but why the extra step?. I never had problems with iphone like this. Second of all it does not do flash video. Apple stupidly made a decision not based on customer needs but based on a stupid conflict with Adobe. Flash is still widely used throughout the internet and its a pain to not have this capability. You can use Cloud Browse app as a work around but its clunky and not worth the hassle. On the positive side the battery life is great. The ipad is the beginning shift to major laptops having touch capabilities and I would not be surprised to see lets say a macbook air with  boot capabilities to run both ios an mac os as well as windows 7. Stay tuned Apple has some tricks up its sleeves but for christ sakes get flash to work on this device. At over 600 plus dollars there is absolutely no reason it can't. Steve Jobs is stubborn. Com'on Steve loosen up. Flash will not destabilize the iOS operating system. How come Android OS can do it with no problem. Can you say Android tablet coming soon.triple;Very useful Device
59;161.0;4.0;8.0;The iPad is revolutionary.  Sure, it's not the first tablet out there, but this year all anyone can talk about is a tablet, what's better, why to get an iPad, why not to get an iPad... I'm not sure when all the Apple hatred started, for me it was a lifelong obsession.  I grew up on DOS, moved to windows 3.11... I hated apple on principle.  I had an epiphany one night as I struggled to use my windows laptop and finally discovered that all those great things a windows based pc can do... I never use! So I switched to apple. My iMac replaced my unrelisble desktop.  My iPhone then replaced my irritating blackberry.  Then my iPod nano replaced my buggy zine (and iTunes replaced the ever changing nightmarish zine software - seriously, the original version was perfection MS, but alas). I had but one problem, my laptop.  I didn't want to do the full on laptop thing, since apple laptops have one of the same problem as all other laptops... Battery life.  For me, my laptop comes out when I travel, or want to window shop in the living room, but otherwise it gets put away in favor of my far superior desktop.  What I wanted was a laptop that I can pick up and go with.  Here is the iPad.  Me and a few friends got iPads, and now we have them all the time.  None of us ever carried around a laptop with us unless we were traveling.  Now, we have them at all times.\n\nThe question for many is: can it replace my laptop.  The real question should be, can your laptop replace your iPad? I see far more iPad wielding corporate soldiers in the coffee shops now days, snickering at the laptop relic holder that runs in to plug his laptop in, not sure if he put it on sleep or power save mode before he left the house.  No, my iPad can't do more.  It can't play world of Warcraft or command and conquer.  But do you leave the house to do those things... No? Then why do you want your iPad to do it? Sure the iPad has games, but unless your a card game addict, it's only there to keep you busy for about a half hour while you can't do much else. Otherwise, I challenge you to find something I can't do.  Don't bring up flash, it was a sore issue at first, but since I found out either the anti iPad people are lying to me about the need for flash, or I just get lucky, I have found 1, yeah that's right 1 site that I don't get to play with, and it was just doing a search for a homework assignment and I found the site to be bogus on my desktop... Oh well.  HTML 5 is here and it's kicking butt. Flash has been on the edge for almost 4 years as devs looked for better ways to do Internet... And the iPad has ushered the revolution.  To think that this little device changed the Internet...\n\nI have complaints.  The first is that I am addicted to this thing.  It goes everywhere with me from the garage (how to vids) to the bathroom (why not watch a little Netflix or YouTube while I... Er... Download).  The second is that it is missing some things. It needs that camera on there.  IPad video chatting should be a next big step.  I want an sd slot for this thing, rather than be forced to shell out extra money for the bigger drive. The last thing I want is a screen lock switch.  It is funny to look at a photo and turn the photo to a different angle to look at something , only to have the screen adjust back to how it was in the first place.\n\nThe best things... Simplicity, durability, longevity.  This is what makes it so much better than a laptop.  Simplicity makes it less\naggravating than a standard computer. You would be surprised at the durability of this thing (my 5 and 6 year olds play games on it all the time).  But the most significant factor is the longevity.  The advertised 10 hours is a lie.  I have not charged mine in two days, and I use nearly every waking hour.  Movies, airplay, dictation, games, everything... It's at 33% right now.  As a consumer I would have never even thought about an iPad if my laptop could go on batteries this long, I could have dealt with the frustration and blue screens all day long if I had power.  The iPad lasts forever. That is the number one selling point to me.  You will be surprised to see how much you can do if you don't have to plug in all the time.\n\nAll this being said, if you can afford it... Get it, if you can't, sorry.\n\nFrom my iPad;Easy decision
98;162.0;5.0;8.0;"I'm really surprised at the number of 1-star reviews on here and the complaining about the lack of flash.  Let's face it -- flash is useful for some things, but as the dominant media plugin it is on its way out.  I've found very little that actually needs flash and the sites that do use it, there is mostly an app that can accomplish the same thing but way better.\n\nWhy not review it for what it is rather than something that you think it is not.  Obviously many of these people do not own one.  The common thread seems to be ""I used a friends"".\n\nI bought this about a week after it came out and I have used it every day since.  I have hundreds of free and paid apps both for fun and work. I recently took it on vacation with my bluetooth keyboard and was able to leave all sorts of things behind.  Watching movies, reading books, playing games on the flight -- perfect.  After taking pictures on my iPhone I was able to wirelessly send them to my iPad where I could edit and enhance them with the dozens of image apps out there.\n\nEvery day something new comes out that enhances the experience as developers have jumped on board in a frenzy.  Gaming is a totally different experience as the size makes a big difference.  Going back to gaming on a phone is just not possible.\n\nBattery life is amazingly long.  Even with alot of use every day, I can get 2-4 days of use with no charging.  It's well put together and slick -- hard to believe it is the first one.\n\nAnd yes, everyone will jump on the bandwagon and try to mimic it -- and if Flash is your one and only destiny that you can't live without, then by all means wait.  Otherwise this one is the one.";Will change the way you view media and entertainment
116;163.0;4.0;8.0;"I bought my iPad about 2 months after they came out and I had a chance to see it operate at the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA.  Surprisingly after having bad experiences with other palm type devices and the Kindle, I found I liked it.\n\nFor a ""Window to the Internet"" which is the main use I found for it, it works fairly well.  A major problem with the iPad, and a major problem with all computers and the Internet, the WWW, is the display size.  Many web pages are not designed with any kind of logic or order about the screen.  For example, I find the blogs I read to be just slightly too wide to adjust comfortably on my iPad screen so that I do not have to scroll horizontally.  Horizontal scrolling for each line is what needs to be avoided.  It is possible to read things on the iPad just fine, but not if they are in a window that is too wide for the text size.  Ideally a newspaper column width where the text can be expanded and vertically scrolled is really idea.\n\nMy favorite App so far is the Kindle reader for iPad.  Conspicuously missing the text-to-speech facility on a real Kindle, it is a visual only reader.  I do not like that there is no way to number the pages, but the Kindle experience is much better on an iPad than it is on the Kindle. I always say that I would more often want to read in the dark with a back lit screen that I would on a beach in the bright sunlight with monochrome e-paper.  The Apple reader I can do without.  I suspect that Apple and Amazon may partner to change the face of publishing, Apple in H/W and Amazon in distribtuion and content management.\n\nWhich brings me to the frightful mess, but getting slightly better, that is iTunes.  The iTunes interface is ... well, honestly, terrible.  If you go to the ITunes store it is so slow and impossible to negotiate that they think only when someone really needs to buy something and knows what they want would they use it.  I buy audiobooks from the Apple store that are not available anywhere else, but I hate the experience, and the reviews and customer feedback is not helpful at all.\n\nMy main App for fun is the online Backgammon game which I really enjoy being a backgammon fanatic.  The finger taps often seem to misregister ... I don't know if that is the problem of the iPad hardware or the program, but it has provided a lot of entertainment and brain stimulation.\n\nIn general though the Apps are terrible and underwhelming, and following the trail of ITunes the App store is awful.  There are so many apps and so little or none useful feedback on what is good and so much disinformation that I just do not get anything that is not free.  I need a audio recorder App, but there are so many and the ones I have tried are clumsy and irritating.\n\nThere is hardly anything to just take notes with.\n\nThe email client is not that great and has the same problems as the Apple desktop OS version.\n\nAll the Apps are so stripped down there seems to be no good help for any of them and most try to be too cool or cute.  I just want a simple interface to jot down some notes sometimes, or to record audio at a meeting or in some situation that I want to remind myself of something.\n\nDespite all the drawbacks, I believe the iPad is going to succeed despite itself.  What is lacks in some aspects can be made up for in multiple ways.  For example people complained about the lack of Flash, which I don't care about, but then ABC and other websites have some up with their own Apps to watch video on.  I watched episodes of ""Lost"" on the iPad and it is fantastic.  I am disappointed that Hulu. Com wants to charge a subscription for their content,but I guess they have to compete with NetFlicks.\n\nThe Skype application works too, so you can use the iPad as a telephone, clumsy as it may feel.  I do not have the 4G3G ... whatever G is the one that is sold optionally with the iPad, and do not miss it.  The object was to get something fast, versatile, relatively cheap and easy with no recurring costs ... and for that I love the iPad.\n\nI carry around about 180 audio books that I have ripped myself as well as some music and stuff I bought from the iTunes store despite it's faults.  All in all this thing is a great tool for many things.  I recommend the Ipad to people who invetsigate it and find they can use it.  Don't buy it just to be cool, it really is a tool, and as such it can be very very useful, and will be more so in the future if Apple can get some of the faults out of it.\n\nThe one thing that sticks with me is the impression one gets of Apple when one enters the Apple world.  I have an iMac, iPod and an iPad now.  I never bought Apple before about a year ago, but I like the UNIX OS underlying, and the ergononomics and ease of use.  My 24"" screen iMac is just a joy to use.  My iPad complements that along with the Ipod ... BUT, Apple makes some some bad design choices and they refuse, maybe out of arrogance to fix them or do anything about them.  This is my on worry about the future of the iPad ... bad management decisions can kill a product dead even if it is a great innovative idea.\n\nOh ... then there is battery life.  In all the months I have owned the iPad so far I have only once or twice gotten the battery down to about 40%.  For me, I find there is no danger of running out of juice and the battery life is really great.  After using the iPad most of the day one day I fell asleep listening to an audiobook and woke up in the morning and the thing was still going.\n\nOne other thing that makes the iPad so wonderful is that companies and groups are making use of it too, as I mentioned above with ABC.  NPR has a fantastic app that lets you run through all the news in the last few days ... or weeks ... and then add the audio stories to a playlist.  Then you can set the thing going and create your own content for hours.  When companies perfect this webcasting thing like NPR this will be the way of the future, and a device like the iPad will the way to access it.\n\nI do wish the iPad had a camera in it, GPS would be nice too.  A better mail client also.  Multitasking is supposed to be on the way later this year, although I find it is not really a problem the way it is.  Bugs are fixed fast, and there are improvements as well ... so all in all I have to give the iPad a 4/5 ... which I mean to be close to the 5 than the 4 ... this is a really innovative product for those that can use it.";Complicated to Review, nice product, depends on the future & Apps
126;164.0;4.0;8.0;"This is from the point of view of someone who already owns a Kindle E-book reader, a Sony PSP handheld video game device, an Ipod Classic, an Ipod Touch, an Ipod Nano, a Blackberry Storm cellphone and an HP mini Netbook.  I have all of the toys anyone out there wants, but I had to make a decision whether to pay a hefty price tag for the Ipad, something that does a lot of what those other devices can do.\n\nI chose to buy the Ipad for this reason...it is the best ""all in one"" device out there on the market.  Unless I want to carry around all the other stuff, it is a better idea to carry just the Ipad and my cellphone instead.  With my netbook, I had to have somewhere to plug it in, with only two hours of battery life, it just was not  easy to start it up and keep it going.  The Ipad has a 10 hour battery life (that is no exaggeration), and it is much quicker to start up than a netbook or laptop.  Instead of carrying around the Sony PSP, I can download fun games onto the Ipad and kill time that way.  Instead of carrying around the Kindle, I can load my E-books on the Ipad and read them on there.  This is a device that you can play games on, type a document, surf the internet, read a book, watch videos and play music ALL ON ONE DEVICE.  That is why I made the purchase. I purchased the 64GB wifi model.\n\nWhile the Ipad is no expert at doing any one thing, it does them all to satisfaction (or better).  If you are a person who just wants a device to read books, this is not for you.  You might as well just buy the Kindle.  If you are just looking to type on this, it is not the device for you, you are better off with a netbook or laptop.  But if you are looking for an all-in-one device that is easy to start up, and has a long battery life, no cords hanging around to be plugged into a wall,...this is it.\n\nThe only thing the Ipad does not do, is snap pictures and make phone calls.  With just my Ipad and my cellphone, I can do it all...play video games, play music, play videos, read books, view photos, surf the internet, snap pictures (my phone) and more...  I don't usually have a wifi connection in my area, but I have a portable hotspot anyway ($45/month through Clear...unlimited bandwidth), and I have the internet on my cellphone, so that's not a big deal to me, but it may be to you.  If you are relying on the internet a lot, a wifi only device is not the thing for you.  Wifi is not accessible in some areas.  You aren't ever sure you will be able to connect.  But, they now make a 3G model Ipad, where you can subscribe to a monthly service ($15/month I think) for internet access anytime,and almost anywhere (limited bandwidth though).  Again, I have internet on my cellphone, so it was not a big deal to me.  If you are relying on heavy internet usage with the device, this is not great, just good in that area, because it will cost you.\n\nWhen you see the Ipad, you appreciate the light weight, the beautuful screen, ease of use, super fast start-up, long battery life and how many things you can do with it.  I prefer to also have the other devices too, so that when I want something that is an expert in any one area, I can still use it.  But, if you want to conserve space in your bag when you travel, and you want to keep it simple...you have all you need.  I recommend the Ipad with a screen protector such as invisishield, and the apple carrying case.";IPAD...JACK OF ALL TRADES, BUT MASTER OF NONE!!
136;165.0;5.0;8.0;"When the iPad was unveiled in January I initially felt very underwhelmed. The famed Apple Tablet, seemingly under production for a decade and now finally revealed, felt like a letdown: it ran the iPhone OS rather than Mac OS, it lacked sufficient hard drive space, and the on-screen icons were too small.\n\nNonetheless, my curiosity remained at launch day, and I began to take a more serious interest based both on user reviews and my own personal needs. Trying the device out further solidified my interest, and this past weekend I reserved one and picked up my 32GB, Wi-Fi only model 24 hours later.\n\nThe iPad fits my needs pefectly. I wanted a simple, consumption-oriented device that would allow me to watch my iTunes content, surf the internet, and would have access to applications that would further enhance it. The device would serve to supplement, but not replace, my laptop, would allow for instant access to the aforementioned features, and would be used daily. The iPad does all that for me and much more.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite features.\n\nVideo looks superb; I've uploaded movies, TV shows, and video podcasts to my iPad, and each plays in high quality and without any hiccups. I particularly like the interface Apple selected for the video application, as the cover art for movies and TV shows is displayed in vibrant color; the video description feature, appearing to the left of the cover art, is a nice touch as well.\n\nWhile watching video on the iPad I'm left only with a thin screen to hold, which elicits a much more comfortable viewing experience with less mass to deal with. Though I've only watched a few videos, I much prefer it to watching video on my laptop. Audio, too, is great, both without headphones (mono) and with (stereo).\n\nSafari, the iPad's internet browser, is what really sold me on the device during my first hands-on. It's been said before, but viewing an entire web page at once, without the need to zoom in and out, is incredible. Both text and pictures look sharp, and pages render quickly thanks to Apple's custom processor. The ""Bookmark Bar,"" a feature that can be toggled on and off in Settings, appears underneath the address bar and is a feature not available on the iPhone due to screen size limitations. I've found this to be really useful, and have added all of my bookmarks to it which allows for quick access to my favorite sites.\n\nLike the iPhone, however, page refreshes have become a nuisance when switching between tabs. I've grown used to it through browsing on my iPhone, however with such a large device I'd hoped it would be less of an issue. It's not significant enough to detract from the overall browsing experience for me, but it is something to be aware of for those who like to have multiple pages open at a time.\n\nLastly, apps. The App Store has become a huge selling point for Apple, and it's hard to ignore the numbers Apple proudly boasts in its ads. I've uploaded both iPhone and iPad apps to the iPad, and both types play great. However, the difference in quality between the two is staggering, and I'm left reluctant to upload any more iPhone apps to the iPad. While the scaled quality of an iPhone app isn't as bad as some may lead you to believe, it's difficult to choose an iPhone app over an HD iPad app after experiencing both.\n\nUnfortunately, iPad app developers capitalize on this fact and subsequently charge many times more for iPad apps. While the price difference may be worth it to some, for others the lesser quality iPhone app will likely suffice.\n\nTo conclude, the iPad won't be for everyone. The steep price can be difficult to justify for those who may not have a well-defined place in his or her life for a tablet device. Further, those hoping to get more features out of the iPad than the device offers may be disappointed in its functionality.  For anyone considering the iPad, defining when and how to use it can help to decide if it's the right purchase to make. You'll likely still need your laptop, but the iPad right now is the best complement device there is.\n\nPros\n- Fantastic video quality and interface\n- Second-to-none internet browsing experience\n- The look and feel of the device\n- Photos in the Photo app look more than impressive\n- Snappiness with the accelerometer, opening apps, and other functions\n- Simple interface backed by easy set-up/maitenance\n\nCons\n- iPad App Store pricing and selection\n- Hard drive space should be greater\n- Page refreshes in Safari\n- Price";Apple iPad: I Knocked It Until I Tried It
160;166.0;4.0;8.0;You are either going to pick this up and love it, or pick it up and wonder what the heck it is.\n\nFor me this is a great product. If you have an iphone or an ipod touch you know how to use it, it really is just bigger. Although it's faster and easier to use because the keyboard is larger and there is more screen area to use for applications. i bought the Wifi model initially and loved it. I put my movies, music, games, RSS readers on it and never looked back. The iPad truly is a great device. I imagine that there may be other brand coming out but in today's marketplace the iPad is the best portable computer I have seen.\n\nSome people say that it has flaws, I have only run into one website that I frequently use that didn't work, and that was CNN. All other sites I visit have changed their video formats over to html5 or other ipad friendly formats. Flash not running on here is really not a big deal for my applications.\n\nThis makes a fantastic book reader as well. I've actually read more in the last few weeks with this then I had in the last few years. It makes reading so accessible because no matter where you are if you have a few minutes you can pull up a book, read a chapter and then move on without having to carry a book around.\n\nThis is a fantastic product, I can't say enough about it. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because it's a bit heavy, and that's the only reason. But if you consider the battery life in my experience has easily been 10-14 hours without a charge you realize that's why it's heavy. It is so nice being able to have a computer that you can literally use all day and still not be able to exhaust the battery.\n\nGreat product.;Amazing

208;168.0;5.0;8.0;5/1/10 - APPLE HATERS ARE REALLY OUT IN FULL FORCE ON THE IPAD....TRY THIS PRODUCT AT AN APPLE STORE OR BEST BUY ......\n\nI have had my iPad for 2 weeks and it is totally wonderful. The LED backlit screen is the sharpest and most accurate I have ever seen! The device is light, easy to move around, extremely fast and does browsing, books, music, photo's, email, and loads of other things perfectly and so so clearly. The iPad also has a characteristic regarding ease of use that no laptop or desktop or net-book has ever had. It feels like you are totally in charge-no mouse to learn, no keyboard to click, all one seamless piece of glass that works flawlessly and faultlessly. Wi-fi is wonderful and works all over the house and outside near the house. The screen is so bright that even in daylight sunshine, you can work and watch this baby. And my first charge watching 3 movies and loads of other things gave me 12 hours of battery. You actually forget that it has a battery!\n\nThis is another game changer devise and I fully recommend it to anyone who wants a computer thats powerful yet the simplest one I have ever used or in my opinion ever built! This is one strong solid tablet and it will do the job! 100% recommended!!!;THESE REVIEWS ARE NOT ACCURATE - APPLE HATERS ARE REALLY OUT TO KILL THIS SWEET APPLE PRODUCT!
245;169.0;4.0;8.0;Purchased Saturday and it does everything I want it too.  Compared in price to the Kindle with the 6 in screen alone makes this worth it.  Can you say COLOR!  Other than that, why would anyone pay $699.99 for a 16gb iPad from Amazon.com while you could go to the Apple Store and pay $499.00, this has to be a mistake.\nAlso, for you netbook guys, this beats the pants off any netbook I've owned.  It's fast and stable.  Your weak netbook doesn't do anything efficiently.;IPad Works
20;170.0;5.0;7.0;"When choosing which capacity iPad to buy, you should be aware of the following:\n\nFor many users, this 16GB iPad will be a great choice because, although you cannot expand its capacity, you can import files ""on-the-go"" with the following Apple accessory: the Apple Camera Connection Kit\n\nYou can use the Apple Camera Connection Kit (the SD card reader part) to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.\n\nThis means you can be bring along with you an almost unlimited number of media files, such as movies, mp3's, and photos.\n\nPerfect for a long trip, etc. Why not take along 100 GB or more? Fantastic!\n\nThere are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.\n\n1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder ""DCIM"".\n\n2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.\n\n3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.\n\nExamples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.\n\nThose are really the main details, but here are a few more:\n\nWhen you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.\n\nYou can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose ""Import"". Or, you can select ""Import All"".\n\nThe iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).\n\nValid video files need to be in the "".MP4"" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.\n\nNOTE: the media files are imported into the ""Photo"" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).\n\nAND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others.";Something to keep in mind about capacity.
31;171.0;3.0;7.0;"My review is based upon the iPad wifi, 32 gb. I have had it about 11 months.\n\nIf I had to sum up the iPad in two words it would be ""needlessly disappointing"".  On the surface, it has everything except removable storage. It is fast, can surf the web (sort of), plays video and music, and has apps out the wazoo.  However, it has MAJOR limitations including the lack of removable storage, no real file management system (I don't count syncing video, music and pictures through iTunes as file management), and the much lamented lack of Flash support.\n\nI had hoped to be able to use the iPad for work. I am an attorney and wanted something very portable, but big enough to read, that I could use to transport PDFs and other case documents. Apple says ""there's an app for that."" I tried several including MobileMe, HD Air, and Goodreader. They will allow you to move files to the iPad and view them, but moving multiple files is dicey and takes an inordinately long period of time. The bottom line is that as a substitute for a laptop, the iPad is not ready for prime time.\n\nI am not a computer programmer or a web programer so I don't know the technical merits of Flash over HTML 5. What I do know is that about every other web page I have viewed has Flash content that can't be viewed on the iPad. Because Steve Jobs and Adobe are feuding, this does not appear likely to resolve any time soon.  This is a big time deal breaker for me. I don't like the ""there's an app for that"" solution -- who wants to have to jump back and forth between a half-dozen apps and Safari (the Apple web browser) to do what you should be able to do on just a browser?\n\nAnother major drawback is the very limited print functionality. Don't buy the hype. AirPrint works with only a small number of HP printers. If you don't own one of these expensive printers, forget printing.\n\nThe aforementioned problems could be fixed with software, but Apple refuses despite customer complaints. In fact, they have raised customer disrespect to an art form by releasing the iPad 2 with the same limitations.\n\nOn the pro side it has all the features you would expect of an Apple device. It has a great music player. Videos are superb and with an optional av cable, the iPad can output movies to an HD TV.  I am not a fan of iBook, but the Kindle app is great. In fact, I prefer reading books on the iPad over the Kindle 3 (I like back lighting).\n\nMy recommendation on this product (and also the iPad 2) is don't buy it unless you can live with the limitations I have noted. The Motorola Xoom has better hardware and purportedly will support Flash in the future. It is more expensive, but might be worth the wait.";Could have been great

60;173.0;5.0;7.0;"Bottom-Line: So far the ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi"" has more than lived up to my expectations and I have no regrets concerning my decision to buy one.\n\nThe ""Apple iPad.""  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the ""Apple iPad"" does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?\n\nI was enamored with the ""Apple iPad"" the moment is was announced because I saw the potential in the portable e-book reader that not only offered more memory than any other device on the market, but also offered up a full color widescreen display, Wi-Fi or 3G wireless, access to hundreds of applications, a web browser, music player, GPS address book, calendar, e-mail reader.\n\nI know, I know, it lacks support for Adobe Flash as a fellow iPad elitists recently pointed out, but I don't miss it.  There has only been one instance where I could not play a video on my ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi;"" that to me does not constitute a crisis, nor does it diminish the considerable functionality the device brings to the hand.  And, I know, I know, the device does not multi-task, but the ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi"" is not a computer it is an e-book reader that also does other functions.  I have a laptop and desktop if I want to multi-task.\n\nThe iPad 64GB Wi-Fi Facts\n\nThe Ultra-Portable, 1.5lbs (1.6lbs if 3G is installed) ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi"" is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5"" thick ""iPad"" you'll find the screen lock and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56"" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.\n\nThe silver-bodied ""iPad"" can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A4 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR is also provided.\n\nThe 9.7-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The ""Ipad"" is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nI really, really, really, like my new Apple ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi."" Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public like I did today!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.\n\niBooks the e-book reader that is specially designed to work with the ""iPad"" is not preloaded unto the device, I had to download it from the iTunes Store; not a big deal.  Once downloaded e-books can be download either directly (through iBooks) or via iTunes.\n\nWhen I connect the ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi"" to my computer and launch iTunes, it automatically sync's the two transferring any e-books I may have bought into iTunes.  Conversely, any e-books I purchase via iTunes are synced with the ""iPad"" automatically.\n\nHands down, the Apple ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi"" is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (699.00 for the Wi-Fi 64GB; hey its $100.00 more to add 3G), but I think it is well worth the cost.  I wanted 64GB in order to have room to download app, music, e-books, and images without concern about running out of space.  This is especially true since you cannot add memory to the ""iPad.""\n\nSo far the ""iPad 64GB Wi-Fi"" has more than lived up to my expectations and I have no regrets concerning my decision to buy one.

70;175.0;2.0;7.0;The iPad is very responsive, is very fast, and has a nice display. It is nice for recreation, but that's about it. It in no way can replace a laptop or desktop. Also, as many people have mentioned, it really is just a larger version of the iPod Touch. I really expected more from this device, but what I got was less than I thought would be mandatory. There's a video editor for the iPad, but there's no camera? And then you have to be near a public wi-fi to surf the internet unless you want to shell out an extra couple hundred dollars for the 3G edition which you have to buy a 3G plan to use which means even more money.\n\nIf all this wasn't bad enough, the iPad pretty much lost most of its portability. Sure it can fit in your backpack better than a laptop and can fit in a manila envolope (not sure why you'd want to put it in a manila folder, but you can), but if you don't have a backpack it's kind of a pain to lug it around. You can't put it in normal pockets and it's awkward to just hold all of the time. It can be used for all of your media, which is a plus, but why would you want it too? You might as well just get an iPhone (not an iPhone 4 though since they're still having issues with that, but that's for another review).\n\nI'm sure that there will be plenty of people who will love this device since it is an Apple product and it does have a few traditional dazzling Apple features, but I think that this device is a waste of money and you should only buy it if you have absolutely no need for several hundred dollars. If you buy this to replace an MP3 player or a laptop, then you're in for a sad surprise. Who knows though? Maybe I expected too much with thinking that the iPad would be technologically on par with other modern electronics and that Apple would have some better way of carrying it that a cheesy pouch or in a backpack. If my review were based on any of these I'd give one star, but the iPad does a good job with its interface and it still has the large app database that Apple fans love so I gave it one more star. I know Apple can do better and chances are that the iPad will probably be another Apple series where they make very small changes in between each product and make a fortune. The next iPad will probably have a camera, but won't shoot video. Shame on you Apple.;Disappointed, though maybe my expectations were too high?
72;176.0;5.0;7.0;"Didn't think one of these would be useful until I saw it in action.  Have had mine for 2 weeks, and have found it a valuable tool for work & play.  Am presently running the 4.2 Beta with no hitches, and the multitasking & folders have been most useful.  I can put on music (my files or Pandora) then switch to a newspaper, weather, or other app and enjoy it as it should have been designed in the first place.  Presently it is shipping with 3.x, so new users won't have those bennies until 4.2 is certified and released.  But even without it, it's a great tool.  I can take meeting notes without having to wait for my laptop to boot up, then shut down with a push of the button and wait all of about 1-2 seconds.  I can pop it on quickly in the morning to read news, etc.  My email (exchange) is fed directly to it as well as my personal POP3 email.  I'm using an app for printing so I'm not using the 4.2 airprint feature but it works well enough there.  I even found a bunch of free apps for my grandson to use - he has fun while leanring some preschool concepts.  Many of the ipad apps work ok, some don't make good use of the enlarged screen, but others do.  Even installed a remote desktop app so I can work from/on my computer & network while away.  It looks for a wifi if available, but I've activated the cellular account so it makes a connection as it needs to.

78;178.0;3.0;7.0;"This is an amazingly addictive device. However, it neither brings the same level of unprecedented convenience to end-users as the iPhone, nor does it feel like a credible replacement for the traditional laptop. And yes, it is over-priced.\n\nPLUSES\n+ Display is bright and sharp. A joy to behold.\n\n+ Compared with a traditional laptop, it is and feels quite lightweight, and therefore convenient to carry.\n\n+ Flash memory means that it wakes up in a matter of seconds. Laptops take longer to wake up from their ""sleep"" mode, and a lot, lot longer from a cold boot.\n\n+ Safari mobile browser is almost as capable as your typical desktop browser - IE, Firefox...\n\n+ There is an app for almost everything you need, want, wish for, think about, don't care about, and wished you didn't know.\n\n+ Video playback (have not tried full HD so far) is smooth and without any jerkiness.\n\n+ Audio quality is very good, even without the headphones.\n\n+ Managing your wi-fi networks and VPN configurations is very straightforward.\n\n+ Downloading and installing apps from iTunes is simple. Nothing to it really. You click to install and the app downloads and installs. No mucking around with install folders, specifying your JRE folder, or such things that we have grown to become accustomed to.\n\n+ iOS4.2 will bring multi-tasking to the iPad, so that's another huge plus waiting in the wings.\n\n+ The touch keyboard is large enough to enable almost full-speed touch typing. No more pecking awkwardly with your fingers.\n\n+ The more powerful processor means that it performs perceptibly better than the iPhone 4 on similar tasks.\n\nNEGATIVES\n- Light though it is, it is still inconvenient to use it for extended periods of time in your hands. You will need to place it on a surface at some point.\n\n- The lack of an in-built stand means you will have a terrible time viewing the screen in a brightly lit room. You will need to buy a third-party accessory.\n\n- The iTunes software is a frustration-laden nightmare to use. Version 10 does nothing to improve matters. If you have multiple Apple devices, managing them effectively with iTunes is next to impossible. Knowing which apps are syYou never know when a right-click is available, where it is not, when to use drag-and-drop, and when to use the menu. Needless to say, it is the weakest link in this chain.\n\n- The lack of a right-click gesture.\n\n- The lack of tooltips and the equivalent of mouse-hovers. You get so used to hovering your mouse over a link or text or image and seeing more information about that markup that you sorely miss it on the iPad. Especially when browsing. You sometimes feel like you are taking a step in the darkness when you click on a link that you don't know what it is going to lead to.\n\n- The automatic content orientation from portrait to landscape does not work quite as well or as expected. If you place your iPad on a flat surface and then rotate it by 90 degrees, the iPad, most of the time, does not automatically change the orientation of the content. You have to pick up the tablet and hold it at a slightly tilted angle, of say 30 degrees or more, for the content to reorient itself. Minor quibble.\n\n- You need to connect the iPad into a wall outlet to charge it. Evidently you cannot charge the iPad by connecting the USB cable into your laptop.\n\n- The closed, walled world of the iPad. No Flash, no Java. Yes, you can use your browser for most things, but if you want to use apps, then the iTunes stores it is. Yes, the store provides some assurance of safety and protection from malware, but this closed worldview is a regressive one, and reminds one of Microsoft's attempts in the 1990s to wall off its Windows users from the internet. Microsoft failed then. Apple could well fail now.\n\n- Price. The iPad, even at its cheapest, at $499, feels overpriced. You can get full-featured laptops for that price, with more RAM, more hard disk, a bigger screen, a physical keyboard, USB ports to plug in external devices into, no limitations on Flash or Java, your choice of software to install, and more...\n\nThe Future\n\nConsider this. A laptop with Flash memory and without optical drives, if well designed, could weigh just as much as an iPad. Innovate a bit more and provide a sliding keyboard so that you can use a physical keyboard when you want to, and which also allows you to place your laptop on a flat surface with the screen tilted, and you have an iPad competitor.\nWhat Apple has managed to do is bring an unprecedented level of architectural integration competence and a very viable third-party commercial ecosystem to the world of its devices, in the form of the iTunes App Store. This, more than anything else, will prove to be a formidable barrier to competition. Till that happens, Apple's iPad (and iPhone and iPod) will continue to enjoy super-economic profits.";Addictive device, yet occupies a transient niche in a curiously evolving space

100;180.0;5.0;7.0;"I've been using an iPad (16GB, WiFi only) since the day they became available (April 2010), and it's been far more useful/enjoyable than I expected.\n\nPersonally, I mainly use it to browse the news sites at breakfast (a replacement for the paper) and as an e-reader (usually in bed late at night, but also when waiting for my kids at various activities of theirs). For both of these functions it easily beats a small portable computer because (a) it's significantly lighter, (b) the screen has the right form factor (and is of better quality than most small portables), (c) it's more social when showing a news item or other site with others, (d) the touch interface is more fun.\n\nMy two (young) daughters also use it frequently to draw (with an app called ""Art Studio"") and play games (board games work especially well with this device). When we go out for dinner, my wife will just grab the iPad and drop it in her purse, and when service is a little slow, or we want a grownups conversation, the iPad works just perfectly to keep the girls entertained (again, much more effectively than the old laptop).\n\nWe bought the simple dock (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPad-tm-Dock-White-MC360ZM-A/dp/B003CGOJ4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPad(tm) Dock - White (MC360ZM/A)</a>) to use the iPad as a picture frame when it's not otherwise in use.  It's in the kitchen, and it just puts every other digital picture frame to shame. The ""Origami"" transitions mode is very tasteful, and with two taps, we can add family pictures that come in through e-mail.\n\nIn September, we bought another iPad (also with a dock) as a gift for my mom. She's been a bit a technophobe for years, and this was our last hope to get her to respond to e-mails and use Skype and Facebook (we live an ocean apart).  Lo and behold: It worked!  (She also set it up in her kitchen as a picture frame, and sending her pictures of her grandchildren no doubt helped convince her that checking an e-mail account on a regular basis is worth it.)\n\nI think Apple has another winner with this one. We certainly feel than we'll have multiple household iPads in our not-so-far future...";Remarkably useful gadget for our family
120;181.0;5.0;7.0;I loved my kndle, but then I got an I pad and I am thinking who can I give the kindle toy to. Sorry Amazon, the kindle feels and looks like a piece of fluff compared to the reading experience the i pad gives you. The best feature is the backlight on the ipad, i love reading in the dark.\nThe reading experience on the ipad is so great but only the start of all the wonderful things the ipad can do.\nIf you are on the fence, which to get kindle or ipad, take out a loan and get the ipad.;Better E Reader than kindle
125;182.0;3.0;7.0;"So I have had my iPad now for about a month. The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.\n\nStrengths\n* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.\n* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.\n* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.\n\nWeaknesses\n* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a ""third device,"" not a replacement for one of your current devices.\n* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.\n* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.\n* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.\n\nSo for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.";Very niche product, mainly for reading magazines
135;183.0;5.0;7.0;"The ipad seems to be the device that you either love or love to hate. I've never really owned many apple products and have always been more of a ""PC guy"", but I decided to try the ipad out and have now owned the 16GB Wifi version for 3 months. There has not been a day that I have not used it... I guess that means I would have to be counted in the ""love it"" group.\n\nYes, the ipad has it's flaws - which undoubtedly have been covered in great detail in the other 150+ reviews, so I won't go into much detail about them. Yes, I wish it could handle Flash, multitasking (which will be added with iOS4 this Fall), and it could definitely use a camera (or 2). Yes, it's basically a big ipod touch and a netbook would be more powerful, more capable, and seem to make more sense.\n\nDespite these short-comings, the ipad has a convenience factor about it that makes it extremely appealing. Being able to pick up the device and have it turn completely on in about 1 second is something no netbook or computer can offer. Being able to lay in bed and hold the ipad like a book while surfing the web, watching movies, playing games, reading magazines, putting together a document for work, shopping, etc. is fantastic and just wouldn't be the same on the tiny screen of an ipod touch or while having a netbook laying on your stomach. Perhaps soon some android tablets will offer what the ipad does and more, but as of yet, no other tablet/netbook even comes close to offering the convenience and appeal that the ipad offers. The interface is extremely smooth and I've become addicted to shopping in the curated app store. It's much easier to navigate and find apps than in the cluttered android marketplace. I've even found that I love some of the games offered - something I never imagined myself using the ipad for.\n\nAs for the Wifi vs 3G debate, I can only say that I'm pleased I went with Wifi because it rarely leaves my house. Even if I do take it somewhere else, there is usually Wifi available and if not and I need 3G access somewhere, I have my phone. I'm equally happy I went with 16GB, because I haven't even come close to filling it up even with a medium sized music/video library and tons of apps.\n\nAs for the ipad vs a kindle - I've owned both the DX and ipad. I love both, but find myself using the ipad more just because of the wide variety of things to do. The kindle does have the advantage of the e-ink screen. If my eyes feel ""tired"" or if I'm in sunlight, the kindle is definitely what I reach for. I've found myself using the kindle app on the ipad a ton though. It's fantastic that I can buy books from amazon and keep my kindle library on the ipad. I do wish amazon would sell magazines through their kindle app like they do on the kindle though. There are other options on the ipad like Zinio, but I feel it's an area that amazon could really thrive in.\n\nA device that I haven't been able go a day in the last 3 months without picking up for hours on end deserves no less than 5 stars in my mind. The ipad hasn't replaced my computer, but it has opened up a new area in my life that I don't think I could go without now... okay, I could but I don't want to. I use it for so many things that I try not to think about those dark days before the ipad came along.";Endless entertainment
157;184.0;4.0;7.0;Thinking about getting one, but what's up with the price? Why in God's name this one is 300 more than what Apple has to offer? Very very confused.;what's with the price!?

175;186.0;3.0;7.0;I don't own one but I have played with one in the store and read about it. So if I am wrong about something then forgive me. This is basicaly a big itouch. In my opinion it is great if you want to do some web browsing or read downloaded books on it. Size makes it good to take on a trip so you can browse the internet or watch movies. Wrong! It doesn't have a stand that can pop out so it can be propped up so you can watch a movie. Imagine holding this thing while watching a movie for 90 minutes or laying it flat to type on the onscreen keypad and staring straight down on it. Or you can hold it with one hand and type with the other. You can buy a case that doubles as a stand which makes it bulky and it is not adjustable. You need a case for this because it doesn't have a lid like a netbook. Imagine this big screen unprotected as you carry it around. They hype this up with it's ability to look at photos and watch movies on. Well you have to buy their cables to load pictures or movies into it. There are no ports of any kind or memory card slot. Just their propietary port for their cable. And what good is having your pictures loaded in it if you can't print them or transfer them easily.\n\nI would strongly suggest you to take a look at the Acer aspire 1410-2497 11 inch netbook (anything smaller will be a pain to stare at)and weigh out your needs and usefulness of something like this. An adequatley equiped netbook can do everything the ipad can and a whole lot more. Can you do your Microsoft word documents, spreadsheets, print, etc. on an ipad? No. And also when in keypad mode the keypad takes up like half of the screen. With a netbook you have a dedicated screen. You can get a Netbook loaded with features for less and it is a real computer. Add up the costs of adding the optional case/stand, keyboard, business apps, etc. How much is your ipad now.\n\nGripes I have with Apples i devices is that you can't just pop out a dead battery and pop in another one and be on your way. No memory card slot so you can upload or download content. And the kicker is they do this on purpose because they don't want you to have the ability of more memory. Like the iphone, itouch, ipod they will market a device with unbelievable little memory. The following year they will market their newer model with a little more memory and charge you more and so on. What kind of scam is this.\n\nIf you want one to take on vacations and to be able to look up places to eat or just to take to the coffee shop and do some web browsing then just get an itouch. It will serve it's purpose less expensive and you can carry it in your pocket and have with you all the time. On vacation it can come in handy. Most places have free wifi now. And if you have kids, just whip it out when they drive you crazy. Sure it's smaller than an ipad but your not going to carry an ipad around with you everywhere on vacation.\n\nSo great for lounging, web surfing, read digital books. Heavy typing or business or school work, no. Netbook little more bulky but can do everything and more. It does have it's place in the world but unless they make a built in stand, put in a usb port, and a memory card slot don't bother. Some argue that it is great for presentations. Yeah but you have do all the work on a computer first and then pull out the cable to load it onto the ipad. You can't make any changes or print anything so now you have to go back to your computer again. Unless you use the ipad apps. And I believe the apps are limited on what you can do. I can understand the iphone and itouch with limited potential because they are meant as pocket media devices. But what makes the ipad such a leap forward besides its bigger screen?\n\nEveryone is allowed to agree or disagree. I am just trying give some thoughs for people to think about before buying. Some may be fine for what it does, but some might expect more. Ask a lot of questions and verify.;ipad or netbook
185;187.0;5.0;7.0;"My after-one-month review:\n\nI think this thing will end up being kinda big. It's not perfect (typing at length without a keyboard attached, for example... but at least you can bluetooth a keyboard to it) but there will be a large number of interesting apps and games (there are already a number of eyebrow-raising apps out there such as virtual touchscreen music controllers, board/card game simulators, and streaming media consumption apps). It is in fact not merely a ""giant iPod Touch,"" although to be sure that's some of it. Huge pluses are the interface responsiveness at all times and the long battery life coupled with the size/weight. (Hate it or not, that's what you get when 1 company designs the chip, the OS and all the other hardware.) It does not have a really powerful CPU, though, but you won't notice unless you attempt a heavy data-processing task such as running HTML5 Javascript Canvas demos. 3D games work surprisingly well. When OS 4 comes out, the multitasking will make this even more killer. The games coming out are really cool, for what that's worth.\n\nCompletely unexpected benefits: 1) For years I was looking for a way to attach a laptop to my treadmill. The iPad fits PERFECTLY on the treadmill shelf. 2) Long car rides with passengers? This could be the ultimate kid pacifier slash map/directions device (with the 3g version). 3) You do in fact start using it more than your laptop, especially for ""couchsurfing"" and ""bedsurfing"" (and, uh, ""poopsurfing"") 4) AirVideo + your movie collection (in any formats) + available anywhere on the internet = amazing.\n\nBasically, this fits the bill better for anything that is not serious working or serious gaming.\n\nI see a lot of reviews here dinging bad wifi or the lack of this or that feature (sd card reader, camera, etc. etc.) I have not had any wifi problems with my Linksys router. Also, you may want additional features in this device but they would 1) add cost and 2) reduce simplicity, battery life, etc. This is a device of compromises, and I think Apple picked them well even as I know future iPads will probably add more features. If you are looking for SD card readers or USB ports (camera kit notwithstanding) or better data processing then you are really missing a netbook or a full fledged laptop in your life. If there's one feature I wish it had, it would be a camera on the back side to make possible even more amazing ""augmented-reality"" applications.\n\nLastly, one review talked about an attempted iPad trojan on his setup. I'm sorry, but perhaps it is time to place part of the blame on your attack-vector-infested operating system ::cough:: Windows ::cough:: before you criticize the iPad for trojan attempts. ;) As usual, the situation could probably be improved but Apple stuff still ends up working much better with other Apple stuff.";An excellent consumption device with some carefully chosen compromises
200;188.0;3.0;7.0;"Hi,\n\nI am technical director at a software company. It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.\n\nI like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.\n\nMy conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.\n\nFrom a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.\n\nFrom the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:\n\nThe Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from ""internet disks"" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.\n\nThe Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.\n\nThe Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to ""internet disks"".\n\nThere are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.\n\nThe Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.\n\nThe Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.\n\nAnd as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses ""tricks"" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).\n\nThe iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).\n\nSo my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.\n\nAs a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.\n\nAs the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings";IPad: Not for real users, more like a toy for gadgets fans
211;189.0;3.0;7.0;The iPad has potential to be a decent device.  After using it for a week, some general strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe Good\n\n- Excellent battery life (actually pretty amazing)\n- Great glossy screen (but also a negative)\n- Fast, no noticeable lag\n- Good balance between size and usability\n- Similar to the iPhone, so easy to learn\n- Apps developed for the iPad show real potential, some are excellent already\n- VIdeos worked great\n- Real potential as a gaming platform\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Glossy screen loves to show fingerprints and glare\n- No multitasking so using it as a notebook replacement is tough (too much flipping around)\n- USB charging requires high power USB port.  Many USB hubs will not charge the iPad\n- Lacks a native file system, ways to store files on it are clunky at best\n- WiFi issues, I had problems with dropouts where my MacBook Pro is fine\n- Using iWorks apps felt clunky, I wanted a keyboard and mouse\n- iBooks app is great, but content is currently lacking (that will improve)\n\nThe current iPad falls a little short of me recommending it but the idea is a good one.  Apple can fix some of the shortcomings with a new release of the iPhone OS (v4).  But my money says iPad v2 will be the sweet spot in a year when Apple takes another shot at it.;iPad -- the good and the bad
218;190.0;5.0;7.0;This is probably the first time I ever did this, but I stood on line about 1 1/2 hours, day 1 & got an iPad when it first came out. I've had it 12 days now & I can honestly say it rates 5 stars. I've got an Ipod Nano, but haven't ever used a iPhone or iPod touch, but was able to feel comfortable using it immediately.\n\nI sold my laptop on ebay after I got the ipad and although it doesn't do everything the laptop does it covers most of the bases, and does it better. For example, if I wanted to use the laptop it would take 3 or 4 minutes to boot up (Windows Vista) & another minute or two to find the wifi connection in my house. The iPad takes literally about 2 seconds to turn on & I can  be on the internet within 5 seconds of turning it on, it always has the wifi connection. The battery does last about 10 hours as advertised, my Acer laptop would never last much over 2 hours.\n\nThe ipad is extremely fast, just a little slower than my 2 year old desktop. Using your hands to get around on it is natural & Apple's touch screen works so much better than my Samsung cell phone.\n\nThe keyboard is easy to use to hunt & peck, I don't think you can do touch typing on it, but it works fine for most purposes, e-mails etc. The biggest negative I can find is sometimes you hit the wrong thing with the touchscreen, it's just not as accurate as a mouse, somtimes it's just lazyness I don't want to enlarge the choices before I make them & hit the wrong one.\n\nOverall I'd sell my laptop & buy the iPad again in a heartbeat.;Love my iPad!!
229;191.0;4.0;7.0;"This is my first Apple device, and for the most part, I love it.  I don't find it heavy (I'm a woman), even to hold for an hour or so; the screen is easy to read from and easy on the eyes, etc.\n\nI bought it primarily to use as a reader.  After waiting for the two major competitors to introduce all of the functions that I was waiting for, I thought the iPad would be the answer, and, as a device, it is.  My huge problem is that ~3/4 of the books I've been waiting to read are not available!  Well this stinks; I've got a gorgeous new device and no where to go...  I was also looking forward to reading periodical content, and like the idea of the latest issue of whatever awaiting me when I get the opportunity to read a bit.  As of now, however, very few periodicals have iPad apps available (paid or free).  I hope this changes soon, otherwise my Used device is going to be for sale here.

26;194.0;1.0;6.0;I am disgusted that a product like this could be produced. First of all, how can they not have expandable memory? Basically they force you to buy the largest model when their markup is more than 50%. Disgusting business practices. Let's go beyond that. The processor is SLOW! This piece of trash doesn't support Flash. How can it be a media center when you can't even go to Hulu? The screen is not HD. The Apps cost more than on Google products. Why is Angry Birds $1 when it's free on all non-Apple products? You are forced to use their music software and all the music has to be in the Apple format. There is no freedom when you buy Apple products. Very frustrating. The tablet is also VERY FRAGILE. I recommend buying any type of insurance you can. It breaks as easy as the iPhone which we all know that everyone that has one has a cracked screen or issues with reception. The iPad also has shaky reception just like my iPhone. The first iPad I had crashed over and over. I broke it when I dropped it from pocket height. I bought a new one (should have waited for the Xoom or one of the other new rollouts) and it crashes as well. IT CANNOT RUN TWO OPEN PROGRAMS AT ONCE! So, if you want to email someone quickly while you are doing something you can, but first you have to close what you are doing. It's because the processor is so slow is my guess. It weighs enough that your wrist will start to hurt if you're reading. The Kindle is MUCH kinder to readers. Much lighter, better screen in sunlight, and a better price, but it doesn't do much else. ONCE AGAIN YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE BATTERY. That means that when your battery life goes so does your iPad. You will need to spend another $800. Oh, the iPad doesn't come with all the software you need as well. You can spend several hundred dollars more on top of that exhorbitant price (it costs them less than 40% of that to manufacture). Overall, the iPad is a failure that was gobbled up by the must haver's that want the newest Apple product regardless of what a piece of useless garbage it is. I know it's not supposed to be a computer, but it needs to function. It needs to be useful. It needs to have freedom for it's users. APPLE OFFERS SHACKLES AND NO FREEDOM. No flash, locked into their software, and you can't expand the memory. Outputs? Hahaha. You're dreaming if you want those. IT'S TRASH.;Filled with flaws

49;196.0;4.0;6.0;"Pros:\n\nThis is an Apple 10"" Tablet computer that packs a lot of punch. It's very small and light weight. The built-in Flash memory allows it to boot quickly and the display looks pretty good. The huge App Store makes getting content for it a breeze. My 3 month old daughter loves watching and touching things on the screen. It could easily replace every leapfrog toy out there. It offers a ton of functionality. There are also a ton of adapters and accessories available for it. The more Apple toys that you buy, the better this thing gets. Works great with Apple TV and airplay.\n\nCons:\n\nApple didn't include a lot of it's current technology in this model. The iPhone 4 and iPod 4th Generation were released around the same time and have a lot more features. There are several key features of Apple's other mobile products that are missing from the iPad. The most prominent is the lack of any camera. Both the iPhone 4 and the iPod Touch 4th feature front-facing and rear cameras. With the introduction of Facetime, the iPad is beginning to feel a little underwhelming. Both the iPhone 4 and the iPod 4th feature Apple's Retina high-resolution display. The iPad does not have this display and you can often notice the lack of resolution in different applications. Many Apps just don't look as crisp as you would expect for an Apple product. Also, both the iPhone 4 and the iPod 4th have 512 Mb of built-in RAM. The iPad (being a bigger product) only is equipped with 256 Mb of RAM. This is surprising considering that the iPad should have MORE RAM if anything.\n\nWhen you compare the iPad with other current tablets, you begin to see some differences. The iPad does not have any USB ports at all. This means that you can't connect USB peripherals to the iPad. Other tablets with similar features in the same price bracket have expansion ports. The iPad also lacks an SD Card Drive which is a big deal considering that the memory can't be upgraded. A SD Card Drive is also standard for other similar tablets. The Wireless on the iPad can also be undependable and the range is poor. I am a Network Engineer and I offer support for hotels and other companies. We get a lot of complaints about the iPad being unable to pick up networks that other tablets and laptops can easily connect to. There is some information available that suggests that the emphasis that Apple put on battery life contributes to the low range of the wifi.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you're an Apple fan, then you'll love this thing. PC people may want to consider going with an Android or Windows-based tablet based on the additional features that you can enjoy. There is also a good chance that the iPad 2 is coming out sometime in 2011 and it will probably have some of the features that are missing from this model. For the amount of investment that is required to own an iPad, it may be better to wait until we have more information on the release of the iPad 2. Still, I will say that I've had a blast with it and I definitely enjoy having it around (but I'm a big Apple fan, so that might explain it).";An Awesome Tablet if you're an Apple Fan
56;197.0;5.0;6.0;"At first I was excited to get this ""magical"" and ""revolutionary"" gadget. Then reality crept in, and for a while it seemed like I had purchased a very overpriced netbook without a keyboard. But with the Kindle app for reading and Netflix for movies, it was really great for those two uses. And then more apps came on board, iTalk for recording meetings, Goodreader for opening all those different file formats, Atomic web browser with all the features missing from Mobile Safari, plus more. And the games. All those games. My PS3, Wii, Xbox, and PSP are collecting dust. Games on the iPad are great, getting better, and relatively cheap, usually under five bucks, compared to fifty or sixty for console games.\n\nThere came a day when I realized that I hadn't touched my netbook or laptop for weeks. I still lugged the netbook around, mostly out of habit, but I never used it. Things were easier on the iPad. And faster, overall--I could turn on the iPad, load an app like Mail or Facebook or weather and be done with it, and have the iPad back in the bag in the same time it would take my netbook to completely wake up (not just for Windows to show up, but to get to where I could actually run a program). Plus, the iPad seems to have endless battery life. Plug it in every few days, and it's fine. I've become used to seeing 5% battery left and not instantly saving everything and looking for an electrical outlet. 5% is plenty of time. Also, if I have to type something long, which the iPad is pretty poor for, you know what? I use my desktop computer. There isn't really a use when my laptop is a better choice than either the iPad or my ""real"" computer. But I have big fingers, so I find the keyboard on my netbook to be only slightly less useless than the iPad's virtual one, and my laptop to be a poor substitute for the full-sized keyboard on my desktop.\n\nThe only things I don't like about the iPad after using it for these many months are: The weight. About half the weight would be good. And the AT&T 3G. It is essentially useless where I live. I unsubscribed and turned it off for good after about a month of frustration. If and when there's a Verizon 3G iPad, I'll think very seriously about getting one.\n\nOverall, I love it. I use it constantly. I've heard similar stories from other people: neat toy for a few days, then buyer's remorse, then it just sneaks into your life and the next thing you know, you can't live without it.";After several months, now my constant companion
57;198.0;5.0;6.0;i bought the ipad for my husbands birthday. he uses it around the house and for his college work. im so jealous! i want my own now. not only can we play games on this pad-i can window shop online to my hearts content, email my friends n family easily and in a more fun way. i can download millions of pdf's and other ebooks, store them on the pad and read whenever i want. my husband uses it for making notes about his classes, applications galore for math, homework tracking and so many other little things i have yet to peek at! ive since given up my old laptop to share the ipad and our desktop until we can afford MY ipad. we seriously love it and its cute to watch my husband get all excited and show me something new the ipda can do for him. right now im watching him play Angry Birds on the couch as i write this. we're getting ready for bed. we added netflex to the ipad so we can snuggle up in bed and hide under the covers like kids while we watch movies. tonight is my night- i want to see The Nutcracker Ballet. lol;Just wow and jealousy
63;199.0;3.0;6.0;Depending on the day, I'm either in love with this thing or I want to take it back. It's great for all the things people say like websurfing, etc. As an ereader I still prefer my Kindle, even though I miss the color screen when I'm using it.  Overall, it's been fun to play with, but I wish I would have waited until the urge to buy it had passed.;Love/hate relationship
64;200.0;5.0;6.0;I am in sales, in home sales with home improvement products. Originally, I purchased the iPad to use for this purpose. I have multiple power point presentations,that also have videos linked to several slides, the iPad handles all of this very well. The biggest benefit for me is not carrying a laptop around,and not having to carry cords and all the delays from booting up and then waiting on p point to load.it has been absolutely a wonderful tool.\nAs a bonus the games and navigation apps are incredible on this.\nAfter having mine for 2 weeks, my wife decided she needed one for herself. She uses hers for educational apps for our grandchildren. She has been amazing, helping them learn and they are really enjoying it.\nThe iPad is a wonderful tool , no telling what the future of these will lead to.\nFor e mail and online activity, you can not beat the speed and the ability to use it anywhere.\nThe only downside is....you have to buy one, no one offered to give me one. That's the only way it could be any better.;Great product
67;201.0;2.0;6.0;First if you want the quick sumery here it is. Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.\n\nThe good...\n- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.\n- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.\n- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.\n- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.\n- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.\n\nThe Bad...\n- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.\n- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.\n- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.\n- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.\n- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.\n\nOverall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.;A good start, but not there yet.
80;202.0;5.0;6.0;The IPAD is an revolution and an evolution in technology!\n\nMy whole family benefits from the applications and features.  I bought mine about 2 months ago and it was the best electronic device we've ever owned.  I bought another for my adult daughter and she thanks me every time I talk to her, she can't put it down.  With that said let's understand that it does not replace your home computer as a productivity device.  You'll still want to use your home computer for Microsoft OFFICE type applications for sure and even photo organizing and editing.  Okay... now back to the IPAD.  The graphics are breathtaking - the battery life is amazing - the speed of the applications and internet are instantanteous.  It boots up real FAST!!! Even the audio is sufficient, but could be louder with some apps.  I purchased a JBL bluetooth wireless speaker for those times that I want to truly enjoy a movie or music video clip with greater volume. The touch screen is incredibly accurate and the sensitivity of the IPAD motion control and orientation is mind boggling!!  Everything links from ITUNES on your home computer. Here is a list of what we love it for the most... we have about 4 pages of apps so far... some free - some paid.  But most are very inexpensive.  We've spent less than $50.00 for all those apps.  Most good ones are $2 - $5 ea.  A Bargain.  Remember with a composite or component video cable you can hook this up to your TV at home or away!!!  I nice way to view those videos, movies, and slide shows.\n\n1) MUSIC, MUSIC VIDEOS, MOVIES, HOME MOVIES, TV SHOWS (at home, in the car, or to pass time while waiting for plane, train, doctor, etc.)  You can also rip from your own CD's, DVD's and upload them to your IPAD.  Watch em - remove em, add more.\n\n2) GAMES !!!!!  OH yesssss... the hours will pass very quickly since there are many many fun games offered for all ages on this device). Be careful it's addictive.  WOW... It's 1:00 AM?? I better get to sleep....  {{wink}}\n\n3) PHOTO SLIDE SHOWS - Take your photos and organize then on your laptop (vacations, family, special occassions, etc.) Sync to itunes, add some appropriate music to each slideshow, and you've got a wonderful POWERPOINT type presentation to show family and friends where ever you go.\n\n4) EDUCATIONAL - There are many many apps that are available and are presently being used in classrooms.  I am teaching my one grandson how to recognize letters and simple words, my grandaughter how to recognize colors and shapes.  You can also download books for children with sound effects and a voice reading the text or you can read it to them.  They can touch objects withing the story and it recites the names of each.\n\n5) IBOOKS - Yes... you can download and read novels on this device as well.  Unlike the Kindle and others becuase of the illuminated display, it can be used in dim light or darkness. Change fonts, and type size. Don't forget that are free periodicals to read including the NY TIMES (free).\n\n6) WEB BROWSING - SHOPPING - It's much faster than my laptop, and it's utilizing the same FIOS signal... it must their SAFARI browser.  Pictures and text on the internet can be instantly resized with your fingers... lets see you do THAT on your laptop.\n\n7) NEWS, WEATHER, SPORTS, TRAFFIC.\n\nIf your budget will allow, I would recommend the 64GB and 3G.  Especially with photos and video you will thank yourself for spending the extra money.  The 3G (not free) can be activated and deactivated and you pay on a monthly basis.  It allows you to essentially use your IPAD anywhere (satellite) and not rely on WIFI hot spots and unknown passwords.  I also recommend the Apple brand neoprene slip case - lightweight, not bulky - protects screen.\n\nCONS - okay... nothing's perfect.  It does not have a cam (I would never use it anyway - not a chat room person) - Does not have printer support (yes it's coming) - this is a drawback for now - Yes it shows fingerprints but mostly when it's off.  I use Windex and tissues or papertowels to clean it off often.\n\nWe really enjoy this device and I'm certain that anyone who buys one, explores all the features and possibilities will become a big fan as well.;Most used electronic device in our home.....incl. the TV
81;203.0;4.0;6.0;I received my new iPad this past week and have been exploring the capabilities. I have to agree that the iPad is a very impressive device. I've only used my iPad with my home wireless network, but I anticipate that will I use it for casual browsing and reading more than my laptop. For more detailed browsing, correspondence, etc., the iPad is not really a practical alternative to the laptop. The iPad is well suited for the social networking functions with some nice apps for accessing Facebook, Twitter, etc. For those who are considering purchasing an iPad, I recommend it for entertainment use though it is not an essential product for the average computer user.;iPad 16GB 3GS
112;204.0;4.0;6.0;"**this is my first Apple product to own** I purchased the 32GB wifi version of the Apple Ipad. I did not purchase it for any other reason than for entertainment purposes, and for that it fufills everything I expected of it. I'm happy that I did not purchase the 3G version, because it was simple to tether to my 3G cell phone for free. Simple couple steps that saved me a couple hundred dollars. Also purchasing a ton of apps, and putting almost a thousand songs on the built in Ipod I haven't needed to think twice about the memory. Unless you download tons of movies, I wouldn't suggest to anybody purchase anything bigger than the 32GB version. I've come to realize most of the complaints that you hear about the Ipad are easily worked around (multi-tasking, flash player, etc).\n\nPros:\n\n(1) the USER INTERFACE(!!!) is something that no ""ipad-killer"" (which by the way, you know you're with the right company with every other companies product is advertised as a ""Ipod killer"".. ""Iphone killer"".. ""Ipad killer""..) haha, I mean lets be real, no consumer cell phone has ever ""killed"" the Iphone, Ipod, nor will any consumer product kill the Ipad nor come close.\n\n(2) the WOW FACTOR(!!!) everytime you're in public with this bad boy you'll get a ton of ""ohhhhs"" and ""ahhhhs"" which is definitely cool.\n\n(3) fast, responsive\n\nCons:\n\n(1) expensive, but the cool factor helps\n\n(2) expensive\n\n(3) kind of stuck to the Apple world of Apps unless you jailbreak your device. not suggested, but i've never had any issues with my jailbroken device.\n\n(4) 70% of App Store apps are paid versus 30% of Android Market apps\n\nAll in all, I love my Ipad. Wouldn't take it back for the world! ENJOY!";Must buy LCD Wipes with purchase!!
113;205.0;4.0;6.0;I love the iPad, but I bought this using a gift certificate thinking it was the 64GB Wifi 3G. It was priced just a little bit more than the one on the apple store, but be careful.  This one is not 3GGGGGGGG, but its $130 MORE than Apple sells it! I should have been paying more attention, but this is the first time Amazon was soooo far over the price elsewhere. I was stunned. Learned a very good lesson.;Watch Out for this one! Amazon overprices iPad!
114;206.0;1.0;6.0;"It has excellent screen and a nice oprating system but WIFI does not work - unstable, horrible connection, dropping it all the time. APPLE support is incompetent - they say ""change brightness??"" basically, trying to get rid of you. I made a big mistake buying it.";Buggy unusable device
121;207.0;4.0;6.0;My husband originally bought this device for himself.  He quickly learned that he prefers his Kindle e-ink screen to reading on the iPad screen... but he also quickly learned that our 2.5 year old toddler could work the device with minimal adult assistance.  Intrigued, we downloaded some learning apps.  iWriteWords, Thomas The Train puzzles, the Disney Toy Story ebook, and an app for developing hand-eye coordination.  The iPad has quickly become the center of my child's learning day.  He colors, learns to count, writes letters and numbers, reads, and completes puzzles.  He also watches cartoons on Netflix, which is great because this allows us to keep him in the same room with us and not have to be subjected to watching Noggin every night.\n\nMost of the apps (except for ebooks) take us a few days to teach our son to navigate.  However, we downloaded Sketchbook pro for my husband... and the baby figured out how to display the hiding menu and change brush colors before I did!  We now have about 12 apps for our toddler and add more every week or so.  While I wouldn't have originally planned to purchase such an expensive device for a small child, I'm really glad we did.  I think the iPad is going to give our child a great head start in school, not to mention it has made him comfortable with and curious about technology.\n\nIn addition, we just purchased the OtterBox case on Amazon to protect our investment in this device.  It is also worth mentioning that even with constant daily use, the battery life has been great.  We charge it overnight each night and it usually lasts all day.;EXCELLENT learning device for children, Kindle is a better e-reader
122;208.0;4.0;6.0;I cant help but think the Ipad is a glorified Iphone but love its ability to play media and be used as a book reader.  The big negative for me is the inability to see any Flash product and all those web sites that run FLASH. I know Apple hates FLASH but really if you cant see thousands of web sites and the product is designed to browse the web I cant help but feel the customer has been placed into this fight and for $700 dollars I think it serves to only upset apple customers. I wish they would fix this and quick.  I don't want a $700 book reader or DVD player.;Media center or I phone
133;209.0;1.0;6.0;I'm very disappointed with Amazon as I just placed an order for the ipad 64GB (without 3GS) and the lowest price showed was $848 plus shipping. Few minutes after placing the order I received an email that the order was already shipped. I happen to check the apple website just to be shocked that the selling price with free shipping is just $699.. To make things worse I'm not allowed to cancel the order..;Wrong pricing
138;210.0;4.0;6.0;They iPad is everything anyone could ever want except for one thing... the price. It is one hundred and fifty-five dollars less in Best Buy or on Apple's website.;Great Product and Bad Price
139;211.0;5.0;6.0;I'm writing this review from a non-technical perspective. I'm an avid reader and have run out of space for my regular books so I started looking into getting an eReader. I wasn't able to make up mind whether or not I wanted to purchase the Amazon Kindle, Nook or a Sony eReader.  They each had their benefits and their flaws.  I decided to purchase an iPad so I can have my cake and eat it to. Not only did I get a beautifully designed, sleek, light weight, eye popping and high definition product with the iPad....I also went ahead and downloaded the free ibook, Kindle, Barnes & Noble and Borders applications.  I also like the fact I'm able to see the images within the books in color. Even though my main reason for buying the iPad was to use as an eReader, I also wanted to be able to do some other things as well like watch videos or play a few games. You DO NOT want to purchase an ipad as a desktop or laptop replacement!  You will be sorely disappointed if you do.  I have an excellent laptop and I'm a hardcore Blackberry user so I knew what I was getting with this purchase and I'm 100% happy with it. Anything that I can't do on my iPad....I can go grab my laptop or Blackberry and get it accomplished.  Some people have a problem with not being able to multitask but that doesn't bother me.  It does everything that I wanted and much more.  I'm not going to go into details about all the specifications because that has been covered by other people's reviews.  There are a lot of negative reviews and think that may have something to do with high expectations.  I also wanted to mention that the iPad is blazing fast!  Apple did excellent job with the overall design.  It's absolutely gorgeous! This was my very first Apple purchase and it won't be the last.;Absolutely Gorgeous!!!!
141;212.0;3.0;6.0;"Well, I just received an iPad as a present. Initially, I wanted to return it for a refund and get the Kindle, but it sounds like my wife may want the iPad. So, I decided to open it up and play with it and possibly get the Kindle for myself. I will have to wait until I get home however, because you cannot use the iPad without first connecting it to a desktop/laptop and going to iTunes. This further reinforces my desire for a Kindle over the iPad. I do not like iTunes and its many restrictions to begin with, and the only reason I wanted something like this was to read books. Something it appears the Kindle excels at.\n\nThe iPad weighs nearly 1 pound more than the small version of Kindle which I am interested in (this makes a difference when I go backpacking); has a backlit LCD display which will fatigue my eyes (although this would be nice to read in the dark with); needs an available wi-fi to have functionality on the go (which is an additional charge in many places); runs through batteries in a fraction of the time; and basically has a lot of neat features, but features that I will rarely use once I check them out and when I would use them, I am already near a desktop/laptop that has them.\n\nOn the other hand, Kindle is light, has a long battery life, is easy on the eyes, and connects free to cellular networks when needed. Amazon, you have it right. Keep Kindle a reader and only add features that support and enhance reading, and you will have no worries in ""competing"" with iPad.\n\nThis is a bit like comparing a pen and paper to a computer. They are two totally different things that have something in common, but neither is better than the other in general. The Kindle is designed for a specific use and seems to do that well. While the iPad is confused about whether it is a notebook/ereader/desktop. What's funny, while the iPad tries to make itself the everything device, it fails to include a camera. Even my cell phone has that. Oh well, I guess I'll have a small device to take on vacations and road trips with me to watch movies and check the web, but it will not substitute for an ereader.";iPad
16;213.0;5.0;5.0;My daughter's 3rd generation Kindle went belly-up and I was going to get her a Kindle Fire.  One of my IT friends suggested a used iPad I instead.  I found one on Amazon's Warehouse Deals for about 30% more than the Kindle Fire, so I jumped on it.  I felt very comfortable buying used form Amazon vs some third party.  When the iPad arrived, it looked like a new one, right off the shelf.  The packaging was perfect and the unit showed no signs of use.  If you told me it was new, I would have believed you.\n\nThere was one problem... there was a short in the power cord.  I notified Amazon and they made it right immediately.  In fact they made it more than right.  I was VERY happy with their solution.;Don't be Scared to Buy Used
161;214.0;4.0;6.0;"First, as some background, I am not a so called ""Apple"" person. I think I might be the only person that does not own an iPhone or any other Apple product. However, I was looking for a netbook and was intrigued by the iPad. I checked it out in the store and then went to a friend's house to play around with his. I was sold when I saw the Netflix app whereby you could stream your instant queue. I also thought the user interface was incredibly easy. So easy that I am planning on getting one for my mom who has never used a computer.\n\nI have been using it for 2 weeks now and the device is doing everything I would want from checking email to surfing the Internet. I am also watching television and movies on it and trying out the different apps. I have actually taken it to the store now because the epicurious app is great and I just shop for the recipes in the store. The only downside and the loss of 1 star is the lack of a front facing camera. I would have like to be able to use Skype on this device and most netbooks have this capability. I am sure Apple will put this in the next version and will certainly upgrade when that happens.";Great device for those looking for a netbook alternative!
170;215.0;5.0;6.0;"If you've ever owned or checked out a Touch, the iPad is merely a bigger version.  But therein lies a world of difference.  After trying out all of the features of my Touch--the e-mail, the apps, the movies, photos, books, and iTune downloads, the internet, the calendar, calculator, contact book, alarm, etc., etc., I stopped using practically all of them.  They were ingeniously implanted in this miniature device but too tiny for my impatient fingers and hungry eyes to waste time on.  I still love my Touch and have it on my person constantly--for music.  But with the iPad, suddenly all of those marvelous features that were little more than ""possibilities"" on the Touch are realities--plain, immediate, and practical, ready for action the instant you get your hands on this amazingly lightweight and user-friendly device.  Moreover, for a modest monthly fee you have the ability to use it anywhere, wi-fi not required.\n\nThe device is so good I'm tempted to follow my wife's example and buy one.  You don't need this thing, but you may need a rationalization.  Hers was its usefulness in her mathematics classroom (she's already using it in conjunction with an overhead projector)--which was a bit of a stretch this late in the school year.  I've decided for the present to come up with the main rationalization NOT to get it--cost, and the impracticality of a ""virtual"" keyboard for a compulsive typist like me.\n\nBut if Apple doesn't come out with the perfect netbook soon (it should be easy--simply attach a keyboard/cover to an iPad), I may have to submit to yet another decadent pleasure.  I had sworn off more clutter, but this latest Apple product has the potential to bring out the Eve and Adam in the most abstemious among us.";Merely a glorified Touch, but try to read a piano score with your iPod

187;217.0;2.0;6.0;iPad doesn't take you beyond more than half a step. Battery is too weak, resolution is too low. Next gen will be something to consider. This is just a bigger iPod. Some do say it can replace Kindle: actually I do not think so. It is something different, but definitely not a suitable ebook reader. To sum up: An iPad? I bought one, tested for a week and then resold. And guess what: I don't miss it at all.;Not more than a gadget.

193;219.0;2.0;6.0;ok let's see, the iphone already does 90% of the tasks featured here. you can play a game, read a book, browse the internet, play mp3's and look at pictures. only here it's just bigger. minus the phone. and it doesnt even have a USB port or flash support (or wireless sync). and it's not a computer either . for this price why not buy a netbook? at least a net book has the ipad's features and more (even if you won't be able to 'enjoy' clicking on glass instead of a keyboard): it's actually a full computer.\n\nif you favor attitude over functionality, the ipad is your next best gadget to buy. it's thin, shiny and attractive.\nit's somewhere between the iphone and a netbook but misses crucial functions the iphones and netbooks (and laptops, in short) already have for a smaller pricetag.\n\neverybody wants the ipad. but do people actually need an oversized, overpriced and brainless browsing board?\n\nnow if Apple manages to put a cpu into this, i'll be the first to buy one, as i work in heavy graphics (and carrying an electronic drawing pad/computer is also a great ecological alternative to paper), but for now, the ipad's functions haven't convinced me to set myself back 600-800$.;lacking in several places
206;220.0;4.0;6.0;"Guess I'm not the only PC-loving fan that bought the iPad.  Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.\n\nBefore the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14"" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.\n\nLater, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:\n\n1.) Long battery life\n2.) Portable & light-weight\n3.) Fast boot-up time\n4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N\n5.) Can play music & movies\n\nYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).\n1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.\n2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.\n3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.\n4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.\n\nBtw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.\n\nAlso, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.  It does the job fine.";It's a satisfying device, with a few minor drawbacks
232;221.0;5.0;6.0;Ok. So there is a lot of hype over anything new released by Apple. Intel Imac's, Iphone and now Ipad. I currently own an Ipod. I, I I.. ha When I first heard Apple was releasing a tablet device I thought it would just be an oversized Ipod/Iphone like a laptop etc. I just went to an Apple store Saturday to look for myself this new item. Is it worth the cost? Any benefit over my Ipod? (For tech stuff see apple.com).\n\nYES!! (answer to my two questions above).\n\nI recommend going to an apple store or best buy store to pick this up and play with it. It's not as heavy as others have written, in fact its almost as heavy as an Iphone. It was well designed to fit on one or both hands and is very responsive. Yes, it appears to look like an Ipod/Iphone, but turn it on and see the dramatic difference. The user interface (apple's own chip) is classic! User User friendly like all Apple products and comes with many great designed accessories. In reference to one of the reviewers on this site, the IBOOKS and reading a book on this Ipad is great. It looks like a book page, feels like one (turning ability) and great on the eyes. Going outside to read? I took the ipad and started reading a book the store had displayed on the Ipad. The light above was about 4 feet above me and the book looked great. However, like the Ipod, Iphone and Kindle, the reflection on the Screen was annoying, but any screen I've tested (sony,Kindle, Windows and now apple) have the reflection.\n\nThe store also had this on 2 accessoies. The leather case and the Dock which makes the Ipad stand up. Great 2 products (maybe slightly price inflated, but great). The charging dock allows you to use a bluetooth keyboard and type or watch a movie etc. THe case folds back to allow you to also watch tvshows/movies etc. Upgrades are always done thru apple and the multitasking coming this year will make this Ipad rock even more.\n\nOK. Is it time for an upgrade? The cost seems a bit much is it worth the cost? Once again yes. However, I'm waiting on the wifi 3g model.\n\nThink of the costs?\n\nwifi-free from monthly charges (minus the source: cable, dsl etc)\n3g- 2 choices both great, but the $29.99 will be my choice.\nNo other monthly charges for phone or text or data. Well, sort of.. he he\n\nP.s. Want an amazing Ipod/Iphone combined into one oversized superior version with for only $29.99/mo?\n\nIPAD is your choice. Choose your memory size. Choose your accessories now. Yes, Ipad=Ipod=Iphone.  How?\n\nDownload your music/tv shows/movies and its an Ipod. (DId i mention watching 24 and abc shows for free)\nDownload beejive application and enjoy free texting with family/friends. (beejive costs $6.99 flat one time fee)\nDownload Skype and enjoy a low cost phone on the IPAD. Yes a phone service on the ipad. Skype sounds great on my Iphone and for $2.99/mo  you can call anywhere in the USA and Canada.\n\nI'll review again once i receive the wifi3g model in May;"Another Great ""I"" product from Apple"
18;222.0;5.0;5.0;I had wanted an iPad for quite some time, but the price of the #2's was prohibitive, and I could not justify the purchase.  Then, after much research, I came to the conclusion that the bells and whistles found on the 2nd gens were not bells and whistles that I required, and price is always a big factor when deciding on a purchase. Sure, it may not be a car, but I usually buy those used. Did I really need another camera that takes just so-so pictures? Not for me. Save those $'s!\n\nI decided on the 1, and since the day my sweaty, little palms touched it, I have been in love.  It provides all that I need.  I can read my books, check my stocks, write email, and countless other tasks.  Now...another consumer may want the aforementioned bells and whistles, but think before you buy.  The iPad1 may not be as quick as the 2, but unless you have had the occasion to measure their speed against each other, how do you know which is quicker? I hopefully will have this little rascal for years to come, and unless a new one comes out with enhancements waaaay above and beyond, I will be sticking with my iPad, 1st generation.;First gen iPad from AMAZON!  GREAT!!
21;223.0;3.0;5.0;Okay...let's get this out of the way right off before I get a bit more detailed. NO FLASH = GIMPED INTERNET......PERIOD!\n\nOkay...now that's out of the way..on to my impressions of this silly gadget. (Oops...revealing a bit too much early..but hey).\n\nSo I get (have) to use one of these things for absolutely zero cost for the company I work for. We develop an application for this thing so I have to have one to test on this platform. I was happy that I would get to test drive one for free and then....poof...nothing. I have it sitting here right next to me as I use a real machine that I will not brand as PC or Mac for public notice (it does't matter..both are superior). It just doesn't do anything that my smartphone or a laptop doesn't do infintely better. Now I have to admit that I am a power user of my devices and demand a bit more control and that may have me a bit biased. However, it gives no excuse to the dilusional marketing aimed at this device by Apple.\n\nLet's get going with the reality. Say you spend 600 bucks on one of these things. From that point on...yer going to put use to this thing...or consider your money wasted. So...if you are to wrap your head around one of those options...it is going to be to justify your purchase no matter how silly...because you don't want to look foolish. That, I think is the case with the iPad. It's just not mature, and it has its place as a toy at this moment.\n\nThen there is Apple's customer-unfriendly way of charging for stuff that should be free. Ohh the App store. I could go on for hours about that. About how Apple locks you into using their tools to operate their hardware and it's all Apple...Apple..APPLE. Marketing..marketing...all things Apple. Use our app to get your music on our device. All else causes problems. There is just no variety with these devices and I despise that. Feels like you never really own the device you purchased. Just a lease with Apples conditions. With my droid phone....I can remote into my home PC and manage everything that a home PC can do. (And I have Flash...gonna be a running theme there...sorry. Jobs is a pompus a**)\n\nI think it is time to clear one other thing up in this review just so it's fair. There are two types of products, those that are easy to use, and limit flexibility...and those that are extremely flexible...but you must become an expert to flex that power. And all those in between. If you are looking for an easy way to do things, not critical about content, and quite willing to pay for solutions as opposed to figuring something out...maybe this is for you. Ignore my review...all the way.  I am just here to put this device in its place. If you have the money to spend on this thing for gimped couch surfing..awesome...enjoy. I will be on something that renders falsh at the moment. (Sorry...there goes another Flash dig...but Jobs...YOU DESERVE IT!)\n\nLet's talk screen resolution. EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE IPHONE. So all you get for your screen size increase is BIGGER PIXELS! (Leaset as far as I can tell..I can see the blocks) So maybe it makes it a bit more useable for the blind and fat fingered...but no real improvement.\n\nBottom Line...call me when I can do work with this thing. I have to say...that all Microsoft has to do is do the same thing and give it a purpose..and Apple loses again. They have a lot of fans for this toy..no doubt. I will admit...millions of people cannot be wrong and it is only a matter of time before someone does this tablet computer right and the rest of us are holding something similar. However, most of Apples commercials and quotes promoting this device are grandiose and dilusional. Making music on this thing????? LMAO...maybe for the kids. Yes...that is what this is...a great KIDS toy. Maybe that is it....I am just expection seriousness from a line of hardware that was meant for FUN. In that case, they hit the mark...bravo Apple. Showing slide shows to the family...browsing a book, maybe a netflix stram in a pinch...but to me there are just no such pinches. I have solutions for all thsoe things already..and they do not let me down.\n\nOkay...okay...let's not make it totally bad. After all you can watch movies on it in bed (or you could get a TV for your room)...surf the internet from your couch  and play smurf villiage which I heard is absolutely ADDICTIVE. On the more serious side, you can get books and read in a beautiful format which I find very pleasent. One thing I found magnificaent about this device is it's place in the education system. Man could you do away with the books and such. For that..it's awesome..but that has to be your use of the device. However, remember...paying 600 dollars to make this thing have a purpose in your life is a bit much. So you better have it's purpose worked out for you, or you'll end up justifying its cost by working it into your life..\n\nOkay...so on to another phase. Here I sit...at home..with my first access to an iPad...and I want nothing to do with it. Why? Because every other device I have will play flash! (Ahh man the Flash thing again...darn it!) How can you have any internet enabled device and not have FLASH. Steve Jobs...you are a foolish idiot and will damned well pay for it. Sure HTML 5 is coming our way....but the CURRENT internet is not gonna be rid of flash for a LONG time you friggin DOPE! (Still talking to Jobs...sorry)\n\nMy last comment to sum up is this. If yer looking to buy an iPad...don't be serious...and you'll be fine. Cheers.\n\nFinal thought...I would rather be a PC user...using a tool...than a tool..using an iPad. BAM!;It's Just Okay...and a Toy
24;224.0;4.0;5.0;"Let me first start off by stating that I am not the biggest Apple fan when it comes to their OS. I have always been a tech geek and love all things tech; so with that said I usually like trying everything. I purchased this iPad 64 during it's first month of launch and here are my thoughts.\n\nHardware: Like with all Apple products, their hardware is always top notch. The design is very seamless and everything just blends together well. If you own any of the iPod Touches then you will be right at home here, even down to the scratch prone back. In terms of weight, the iPad feels light initially but after a few minutes of web surfing or book reading you will soon realize that you're holding a 9.7 inch screen device. Not to say that its heavy, it just takes a little getting use to. I've read many reviews where people complained about the large screen bezel, but I rather like it because it gives you more real estate to hold the device comfortably without accidentally triggering the touch screen. Final verdict on hardware? It's worth every penny.\n\nSoftware: Here is where my love-hate relationship with Apple starts. I have never been a fan of their computing OS or their mobile iOS. If you own an iPod Touch (which I own 2), then the interface is identical. Although there are a few tablet optimization on the iPad (like the calendar and email), I don't think its enough to justify this purchase if you already own an iPod Touch. In term of usage; pretty much everything I do on my iPad I can also do on my iPod Touch. I think the software has potential and will grow as the developers create more tablet centric apps. Final verdict on software? If you have an iPod Touch, been there done that.\n\nOverall use: So what do I use my iPad for? My iPad actually get heavy usage, I work in an ER and I consult patients on a daily bases. I use my iPad to input and extract data during my consultations. Extremely useful and handy in that regards. I love the ability to have my iPad boot up instantaneously (as appose to my lap). Being able to talk to my patients and swipe and flick through my forms is almost effortless. I also use my iPad to create art work using SketchBookPro. There are times when I have to contribute to text book chapters and a figure or diagram is needed. I actually create and draw those figures on my iPad and import them to Photoshop for final touch ups. I think being able to do these 2 things makes the iPad purchase worth while. If you consider all the other casual things I use my iPad for (Netflix, websurfing, iHeart Radio), it is a great buy.\n\nRating: 4.5/5 stars.";Great tablet
25;225.0;4.0;5.0;The IPad was delivered on time, and in fine shape.  I'm very pleased with the IPad itself.  It only has a Wi-Fi connection, but I can quickly connect through my router at home or at any business having Wi-Fi.  I also find the 16 GB to be more than enough for all my books, songs, and pictures (although I have not tried using it to view a movie).  I thought about getting one of the newer IPads, but found I really didn't need most of their features.;Apple IPad (original version)

29;227.0;3.0;5.0;When I decided to buy the Ipad, there was no news of the Ipad2. So I thought Apple would launch a new product by august/2011 or if a new one was to be launched, they would announce it, so customers like me would wait some days to buy the Ipad2 or if they give a generous discount the decision would be easier. But they did not give any clue whatsoever of the new product, neither did the retailers like Amazon, that surely knew what was happenning. I rated 3 stars because Ipad is a good product, but for the same price, 20 days later I would have bought the Ipad2 or should have had a discount in the Ipad.;Fooled by Apple, very disapointed

34;229.0;1.0;5.0;First of all, the ipad doesn't hold a candle to the E-ink devices (Nook, Kindle).  I find it difficult to read for long periods on the ipad (not nearly as easy on the eyes for reading).  Also, if you like to read, you will not appreciate the added weight of this device.  There are a couple of fun games, but there is very little practicle use for this.  The fact that it costs more than the brand new Windows 7 Dell laptop I bought almost makes me laugh when I consider how much use I actually get out of this thing.  I would say save your money and get a new laptop and a new smartphone for the price of one ipad.  You will get a lot more for your money.;expensive tech toy
44;230.0;5.0;5.0;Okay, this review is for us regular folks (who know and use technology but aren't real techies)...\n\nFirst, I really do enjoy it.  The screen size is wonderful and I love being able to just touch the screen to make things happen, as one can do with the iPhone and iPod Touch. and the batterly life is fab...\n\nHaving said that, I gotta say that the iPad is a large iPhone/iPod Touch minus the camaera, video, and calling capability. So, if you do things on either one of those devices and ever thought to your self, man, I wish this screen was larger, than this device is for you.\n\nHowever, I defn would not purchase this thinking that you are going to get rid of your laptop or desktop PC.  While I use mine frequently and do enjoy it, there are somethings that I just can't do as well on the iPad as I can do with my laptop.\n\nnow, the iPad VS the Samsung Galaxy Tab\n\nyes, I have the tab also and like both for different reasons. The Galaxy Tab DOES have the camera and video capability and 3G comes standard. But, the biggest difference I noticed is the Galaxy has a 'Swipe feature that is REALLY cool and it is much cheaper.  But, it does have a smaller screen and there isn't a way to convert my iTunes music so that I can listen to those files on this device.;A Large iPhone/iPod Touch...
55;231.0;5.0;5.0;"A few years ago I read an interesting article by the developer of the Palm Pilot.  He described how he walked around the office with a block of wood to help him imagine what it would be like to carry and use a working PDA.  We have all walked around with a legal pad or something like it.  I think the Apple designers did this, too.  But with a little more awareness than most of us have.  The iPad is the result of this awareness.  I wangled mine at the beginning of this Christmas week and have had a few days to carry it around.  Here's what I think:\n\nThe main advantages from my point of view:\n\n - Screen size.  As big as a piece of paper--not cramped like my iPhone screen.\n - Weight.  Just like a legal pad with a cover.  Maybe just a little heavier.\n - Keyboard.  Big enough to type with two hands.  Two fingers, in my case, but still...\n - Apps.  All iPhone's supported, with 2x mode for those that don't adapt to the big screen.\n - Convenience.  Type notes, documents, dissertations anywhere without setting up a laptop.\n - Newspapers.  I didn't think that screen size mattered for news apps, but it does somehow.\n - Web browsing.  As good as a desktop; better than iPhone special interface apps.\n - Pictures and movies. Wow!\n\nThe minor disadvantages:\n\n - The size.  No complaints, but it is less convenient to carry than my iPhone.  Well, of course it is.\n - No split screen.  I really would like to have two apps side-by-side.\n - Not a laptop replacement.  This is fine--but don't kid yourself.  Keep your laptop.\n - Not an iPhone replacement.  Not small or convenient enough.  Also no phone.\n - Too shareable.  Unlike an iPhone, which is clearly personal, people feel free to borrow it.  Grrr!\n - Too pricey.  Worth it, but just barely.  Somebody at Apple is very good at figuring price points.\n\nI'm glad I got it and I don't think I will change my mind.  I think I will keep using it to write on the metro, in front of the TV--like I am now--and other places where using the laptop doesn't quite work.  And, as when I first got my iPhone, I will temporarily turn into more of an app junkie to find the coolest ones.  They're only a buck, right?  Mostly.";Apple's Electronic Notepad
61;232.0;5.0;5.0;I bought my iPad a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it.  I do not have an iPhone, but I do have an iPod touch.  The iPad is almost like a large-scale iPod Touch or a small netbook computer that has really inexpensive, fun, and practical apps - the apps are the game changer for me.  Yes, there are other options out there that have apps, but not killer apps like those created for the Apple products.  The ebook viewer is exceptional, and movies are beautiful on the iPad.\n\nI hardly ever use my personal laptop anymore - instead I use my iPad to access all of the sites that I used to view with my laptop.  I travel a lot for work, and the iPad is like carrying my own laptop with me, but without all of the weight and bother (I already have a laptop for work).  If you like your iPod touch or iPhone, but want a bigger screen and a product with functionality that is between your iPhone and a laptop, then the iPad may be a good option for you.;Love the Apps!
66;233.0;5.0;5.0;"I bought my wife the iPad for her birthday a few months ago, and she's very happy with it.  However, she mostly uses it to watch Chinese YouTube videos and to surf a small set of web sites.  She occasionally uses the built-in apps (NYTimes, ABCnews, etc.)  Again, she's very happy with it in this limited capacity.\n\nWe're also both very happy with the build quality and the fact that it works just like our iPhones - so the learning curve is 0.\n\nWhere the iPad really falls down is when you want to (or have to!) visit web sites that use Adobe Flash.  No matter what Steve Jobs says about Flash (it being a battery hog, etc.) he did his customers an extreme disservice not giving *them* the choice.  His claim that only a small part of the Web uses Flash is pretty much a lie.  Just try to visit any commercial site that attempts to show its customers 360degree views of its products - none of them display with the iPad.  We're not talking minor web sites - try [...] (you can't even see their main page with the iPad because it's *entirely* flash based), volvo.com, honda.com, toyota.com.  Many games web sites use Adobe Flash for their games - again, none of them display on the iPad (I won't even go into the iPad's inability to display Java - forget about all the web sites that use it for games, or other content).\n\nAnd there's pretty much no chance that Steve Jobs will ever change his mind with regards to supporting Adobe Flash on either the iPad or the iPhone or the iPod Touch.  He simply decided that you should not have a choice in this matter.\n\nSo while we enjoy the iPad for what it does, I can't give it 5 stars - because it is unable to browse a large swath of the Internet.\n\nIf you want to be able to browse *all* Web pages with a tablet, you're better off getting an Android 2.2 (or above) based tablet - such as the Samsung Galaxy and a slew of other forthcoming tablets.  They all support Flash.\n\n-------------\nUpdate (Feb. 1, 2013): It's now three years later and Apple still doesn't support Flash.  But, guess what?  IT NO LONGER MATTERS!  Most web sites have moved their content to HTML 5.  We've moved on from from our original iPad to the iPad Retina, and from there to the iPad Air.  And we've been deliriously happy with all of them!  An added benefit of buying Apple products: you get a decent trade-in value!  Each time we traded in our old iPads (by the way Amazon has a great trade-in program for iOS devices), we've gotten at least two hundred dollars.  The competition gets you next to nothing in trade-in (I know - I bought my parents a Kindle HDX 8.9"" a bit over a year ago - that's already only worth $90 - on Amazon's own trade-in store!)\n\nSo I'm upgrading the iPad review to 5 stars.  Flash is simply no longer an issue.";Quality product

I have access to the same files, and can do most of the same things.\n> Links up perfectly with a bluetooth keyboard.\n> Instant on.  No waiting to boot up.\n> The screen size is perfect.  Jobs is correct that anything smaller would be problematic.  I can just read all web sites, emails, etc.  Perfect size.\n> The touch screen is very accurate, responsive, and smooth.  I can touch a very small link at ht it right 99.9% of the time.\n> 3G reception is better on my iPad than on my iPhone 3GS.\n> Kindle books look great.\n> Tons of apps.  I can write a full proposal, create a spreadsheet, and develop a presentation all in Microsoft Office format.\n> Pages, Keynote, and Numbers now export to Office-compatible files, so these nice apps make the iPad even more useful.\n> Free cloud-based file storage via DropBox.\n> FTP/LAN server access to all my office files via GoodReader.\n> PDF reading, storage, and mark-up.\n> Store PDFs in iBooks.\n> Incredible screen for watching movies.\n> Battery life is as-advertised.  I get 10 hrs of good use out of each charge.\n> Wireless printing coming in November!\n\nThe not so great:\n> No wireless printing, but that is coming in November 2010!  Still, would be nice to be able to hook up to a USB printer via the camera kit.\n> Glare is significant, but I bought an anti-glare screen protector.  Problem solved.\n> Hard to carry around with that open face.  The Apple cover is a nice accessory so you can carry the iPad around like a notebook.\n> On-screen keyboard is okay, but not for prolonged, heavy typing.\n> A tad on the heavy side.

The future is easy to use touch screen programs that connect to everything around you. iPad is that fist step in that direction.\nGreat product!;Future of computing in your hand
106;239.0;2.0;5.0;The good:\nThis thing is so cool in so many ways that I could not list them all.  Great battery life.  Good sound.\n\nThe bad:\nThis thing is so bad in so many ways I could not list them all.  The shape is not good.  No camera. The price! Needs better connectivity.  Lack of FLASH support a total deal breaker.  I was sitting in a restaurant showing this thing off when it started to rain.  I went to Intellicast to get the weather radar.  No joy.  Intellicast uses FLASH.  More sites use FLASH for more things than I ever knew.\n\nBottome line:\nThis thing is a very cool toy that can be usefull but is not well conceived.  Just wait, there will be better things out there.  Maybe the iPad II?;No FLASH support.
115;240.0;5.0;5.0;"Some people write insanely long reviews.  I have been guilty of it before.  Here's my not so short review.\n\nI had a hard time justifying this purchase.  I have a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet, a 24'' iMac, and 2 PCs I built for gaming.  This computer ABSOLUTELY fills a niche.\n\nGood:\n\nEasy to lug around in a bag, or in my car, or into a store, to a meeting, wherever.  Very light and portable.\n\nI can VPN to my MAC, use it as a remote control for my TV, read PDF books on it (love doing that), play games, and I am finding new cool stuff everyday.  Just today I learned to use it as an emergency GPS!\n\nBattery lasts forever.\n\nInternet everywhere.  Everywhere there is AT&T that is.  It is nice to have a computerish device with connectivity anywhere, like at a store where you want to do some price exploring.\n\nBest:  Screen.  Unbelievable.  I put a few movies on here in case I fly or use the netflix app and it looks great.\n\nBad:\nNo multitasking.  Apple needs to speed it up, but it's coming. You shouldn't do any heavy multitasking but one thing that is annoying is I had a timer going and logged into another app.  Forgot about it and expected it would still go off when I logged over, but it didnt.\n\nNo Flash.  Hasn't been very inconvenient yet.  Anyone who has taken any course in web design is taught that you design two sites - one for awesome computers and one for those people who replace a computer every 10-15 years.  Most sites have non-flash, but I have seen a few video/game sites that don't work.  Hopefully Adobe and Apple will rebuddy\n\nNo file system.  You need outside apps or cloud storage to save stuff.  Again, I don't expect to do heavy word processing or productivity on here, but would be nice to have a little ""fake"" drive to save stuff on.\n\nNo camera.  You can hook up your flash drive or camera through 3rd party devices.  Not ideal\n\n Overall:  I love this thing.  I take it everywhere.  I bet the 2nd gen will be even more amazing.  If you are debating, don't hesitate.  Just visit the app store or a ""top apps"" site and check out the things you can do.  As people raise issues and innovative app designers have fun with newer features, this device will just get more awesome.";I teetered, purchased, and love it
127;241.0;5.0;5.0;First off, do not buy this as a fully functional computer, that it is not.  Yes, you can check email and surf the net, but it really isn't fit for word processing or any heavy computer work.  It is a really cool peripheral device.  By the way, I bought my 64gB wifi+3G iPad at Best Buy for $829.  While I love Amazon, seriously, you save $200 by buying it in a store.  The apps are great, but by far, my favorite thing about it is watching netflix streaming movies.  That is the best.  I'm still waiting to try out the iBook feature, I downloaded it for free, just haven't tried anything with it other than the included Winnie the Pooh book.  I even downloaded the Kindle app, which makes the screen un-backlit, like a Kindle screen, for all of you who don't like the backlit screen.  All-in-all, I am extremely happy with the purchase.  Just don't buy it as a computer, buy it like you would an iPhone with much more programming and entertainment opportunities.;Great portable email/entertainment device
137;242.0;5.0;5.0;Received product, setup and quick startup operation in minutes.\nThe screen is exceptionally bright and the touch screen works superb.\nLots of free and fun apps to download with some really useful for maps and travel.\nBest of all, the battery life is unbelievable! Advertised as 10 hours but have been\n able to squeeze 12-14 with some rest periods in between uses.\nE-books using Kindle or iBook app works great.\nAbsolutely no heat issues during use but can at times require switching the way it's held\nas it does at times feel slightly heavy, but not a burden.\nFont's are much easier to read due to increased size and now my daily news reader.\niPad 4.0 (due Fall 2010) will make the unit nearly 100% replacement for my MacAir  I normally carry.\nUtilized in business meetings for demonstrations of software applications and slide shows to\nshow product pictures. Slide show built into app works great too. 3G signal reception generally\ngood in most cities with no antenna issues.\nWell worth the $ 800.00+ for the 64GB 3G unit.;Another great product from Apple!
152;243.0;3.0;5.0;The iPad is ok, but I was hoping for better.\n\nWhat I like: watching movies, reading books, battery life.\n\nWhat I tolerate: browsing (many little issues with Safari and most web pages that I read have many small links that are challenging to touch at the default page resolution), email (builtin mailer isn't very good at managing mailboxes, especially trying to avoid reading messages that might be spam), typing (a learning experience for a touch typist).\n\nWhat I dislike: most of the rest of the apps, builtin and third-party. The lack of a decent way to view photos in an album or read PDF (offline) is particularly annoying because those seem like things that would be good on the iPad. Conventional wisdom is the apps will get better, but a major issue is that the iTunes user interface to the Apple App Store is poor. Support for searching for apps and sorting results by user rating is particularly lacking.;Disappointed
169;244.0;5.0;5.0;I have had the Ipad 64g 3G for a little over two week and I'm still just as addicted to it as I was the first day. I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad 3G you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi plus 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t. The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book. Like it or not the iPad is a revolution and created a whole new device category and will do for tablets what the ipod and iphone did for mp3 players and cell phones.;The iPad 3G will change your world for the better,
203;245.0;4.0;5.0;There is so much to like about this product. It is versatile, light, and adds to my productivity and entertainment. What cripples it as a Web browser is lack of support for Flash. Whether Apple likes it or not, Flash is so ubiquitous that the iPad fails to live up to Apple's claim regarding it's abilities as a Web browser.;Needs Flash support
215;246.0;5.0;5.0;"Chances are, if you venture onto this review page, you are considering buying the Apple iPad.  If you happen to read the negative comments first, let me just say that they are people who simply dislike Apple products, or jealous of the media attention that Apple gets.  Most of these ""reviewers"" don't even own one.\n\nIf you have an Apple store nearby, drop by and experience it yourself, not just the iPad, but any Apple product.  Have a great day!";Ignore the Naysayers.  Get One If You Like It.  I Love Mine!
220;247.0;5.0;5.0;iPad is a bit intimidating at first.  However once you master the device, iPad becomes your second nature.;Highly recommend
228;248.0;3.0;5.0;Apple again did a very good marketing. I saw many people rushed to buy it because they saw good reviews and they though it was cool, but not thinking as an adult whether it is really useful. I posted my review on ASUS netbook when it was out at $399, saying it worth $199. That is the price of it in 6 months. For iPad, the cost to produce is about $250. So $350 should be a reasonable price. Note that you have to pay for wireless providers. It is not even close to a laptop, for sure. Will I get one? Probably, but not at this price. Oh, I am sure Apple's CEO is happy that you pay for his dinner. He did a really good job, though. I actually likes a color digital device to read magazines/books, but not that small. I bet either Apple, or other company, will release a better device at the size of a real magazine soon.;Nice device, but high price
236;249.0;5.0;5.0;The iPad is an unbelievably cool product!  I've had it for a week now, and it has exceeded my expectations in every area but one.\nIt is such a pleasurable experience to hold it and interact with the machine.  It is a very intuitive, tactile, and personal interaction with the web.\nHaving a touch screen to interact with the web is a very different experience than using a mouse.\nIt is NOT supposed to be a netbook, so reviews which compare what it doesn't have, miss the point.\nThis is a whole new computing device to accomplish perhaps 80% of what most people use computers for.\nFor all the basic uses (email, websurfing, music, movies (the Netflix app rocks!), games, ebook, magazine reading (Zinio is great), and the news (the USA Today app is a joy to use) it is great.\nI have already been finding myself on my laptop much less often than before.\n\nThe iWork apps are a pleasure to use.  The one area that seems to be more convoluted than it should be, is printing.  You can't print directly from it.  You have to either email it to yourself, or transfer the file over when you sync with iTunes.  But it looks like the 4.0 version of the operating system is going to provide a lot of fixes which people are looking for.\n\nA few years from now, tablets like this will be everywhere, and those who are on computers are mainly using them for work.\nI knew the iPad would be a big hit when my 70 old mother, after seeing mine, decided she was going to get one too!\n\nDr. Bill, [...];Entirely new class of product
1;250.0;5.0;5.0;This product will prove to be as big a hit as iPhone. Even though it lacks a few features right now, knowing Apple next versions will totally nail it. It brings so much content to you with the right interface that this is going to become the primary device of multimedia and internet content access.;iPad is going to rock

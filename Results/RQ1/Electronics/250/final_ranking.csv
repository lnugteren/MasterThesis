8;23;35;0.643155908449648;got ipad little two months ago nice device lots stuff guess problem anything laptop iphone ca plenty stuff laptop ipad ca things ipad ca well machines n napple marketing device gives many impressions example ipad thin light therefore easily portable ipad puts internet hands giving ability browse whole internet swipes fingers magical revolutionary 499 incredible deal unfortunately longer ipad drift conclusion none claims true n nthe ipad certainly thin thicker first generation iphone fairly light 1 5 pounds much lighter laptop even netbook question make easier use answer bottom line ipad still 10 device take account needs case protected becomes thicker heavier way apple case ipad going run 40 m student lugs around 10lb textbooks daily basis make difference whether computer backpack 4 5lb laptop 1 5lb tablet ipad portable laptop n nwhen use ipad wo seem like thin light device unlike laptop rest desk lap pretty much constantly hold ipad angle best since need one hand interact device job holding delegated hand becomes tiresome short period time although like idea able watch movie netflix read kindle book ipad extended periods time really feasible activities better suited laptop tv paperback re old fashioned apple could make ipad less pound would greatly help could also buy stand ipad goes another 30 n nso ipad easier carry around laptop weight makes difficult use extended periods perform re actually using fine almost tasks netflix videos load quickly movies rented purhased itunes look fantastic music native ipad applications rhapsody pandora sound great etc wonder though touch interface used ipad really logical touch interface ipod touch iphone makes sense allows screen much bigger instead many small buttons ipad however constantly flicking screen seem intuitive scrolling long list musical artists example takes much grandiose hand movements iphone saying touch interface work well ca fun suggesting using mouse track pad screen large might make sense touch interface ipad compelling using safari often think laptop browse internet much easier n ntyping ipad another problem on screen popup keyboard decent size size keyboard netbook trying serious typing 2 dimensional interface tough easy enough type thumbs iphone keys within easy reach try type ipad anything 40 words per minute type 110 words minute proper

devices like sony psp nintendo ds designed fit hands nicely ipod touch small enough work gaming device ipad large designed gaming even simple gaming example game china town wars quite fun ipod touch would think generous screen ipad would make even fun unfortunately stretch fingers even reach controls greatly limiting fun potential games like doodle jump force physically move ipad quickly get tiring weight machine n nultimately think people want ipad exciting easy new way browse internet consume media interface used laptops computers far superior way things ipad made realize never problem way laptop functions part reason iphone works well fits pocket ipad tries bridge gap two result anemic compromise get neither portability iphone power ease use laptop related note 16gb storage memory device like pathetic music collection alone 40gb movies least 1gb pop get expensive ipad slightly memory point ipad becomes expensive half decent laptops start wondering give reason n ni would give ipad 1 star m giving 2 build quality aluminum backing nice touch screen work well battery life sufficient need carry around charger decide take ipad ipad starts sleep couple seconds app load times

1;10.0;5.0;5.0;200;This a review I wished most people would post, about the blu ray, not the film. If you are interested in purchasing this film, most likely you seen and enjoyed this classic. Or you're are a criterion completist. This transfer is gorgeous, no other PD release compares, and the supplements are great. That's all you need to know. So just get it over with and purchase this excellent criterion release.;All you really have to say
2;8.0;5.0;6.0;266;The '00 Criterion dvd release is nothing to sneeze at, and current used prices are indeed attractive. This version has 2 discs, a great transfer, loads of extras, and includes the 7 min. longer director's cut (new blu does not). From one who appreciates marketing art, also prefer the '00's cover (original '62 poster art). Recommended!;A gem previously released . . .
3;12.0;4.0;5.0;273;"""Carnival of Souls""(1962) is directed by Herk Harvey. This is a film about a woman who survives a car crash, but who is then haunted by a strange apparition. This was Harvey's one and only feature film, which was filmed on a shoestring budget. David Lynch admired this black and white film with its stiff, odd acting and strange haunting feel. This film also reminds one of Alain Resnais' 1961 film ""Last Year at Marienbad"" with its statue like actors and haunting interiors.\n\nThis blu-ray set has a number of interesting special features, including deleted scenes, outtakes, a locations documentary, a video essay by film critic David Cairns, an interview with writer Dana Gould, excerpts from some of Harvey's industrial films, a history of the Saltair Resort in Salt Lake City where much of the film took place, and an essay by writer Kier-La Janisse. As always Criterion does a great job restoring the film. My only complaint is that Criterion didn't include the director's cut which was about 7 minutes longer. Evidently they didn't do so because the added footage was inferior (lower resolution) to the rest of the film. This version is 78 minutes in length.";Cult favourite...
4;13.0;5.0;5.0;279;Criterion's Dvd edition of this film was really impressive, but this new Bluray is a revelation. Not just the video, which is pristine, but the audio is superb. The atmospheric soundtrack is strong and very effective. I never thought I would own a reference quality edition of this classic indie film (made for barely $30000). All of the supplements from the dvd are here. A must own!;Another Must Own Criterion Bluray
5;3.0;5.0;18.0;279;"One of the all time great cult films. Not for everyone's taste but a true work of art that still fascinates countless fans. This Criterion Blu-ray shows the 35mm black & white film transfer in razor sharp clarity and beautiful sound. The last time I watched ""Carnival"" it occurred to me that the organ soundtrack is perfect not only because Mary is an organist and organ music is traditional for funerals, but also because the Saltair carnival building that she is drawn to had its heyday back in the 1920's when movies were silent and usually accompanied by an organ. So it's like the movie itself is straddling between the silent movie days with organ music, and the present with dialogue and other sounds. I think when the sound doesn't quite sync up, it makes the film seem like a weird dream, or perhaps part of Mary's strange fractured hallucinations. The interpretations are endless, which I believe makes the movie so fascinating to so many people. A true masterpiece. Highest recommendation.";Criterion Blu-ray is Beautiful
6;14.0;5.0;5.0;282;Very nice Blu-ray transfer of this movie.  Criterion did an outstanding job, as usual.  The previous DVD of this by Criterion had a theatrical and Directors cut of the movie, but the Blu-ray has just the theatrical cut.  Still worth getting for the quality.;Very nice Blu-ray transfer by Criterion.
7;9.0;5.0;6.0;286;I am delirious with joy over my purchase of this amazing blue ray. Even though it didn't come through wide screen it made the picture even more clear and amazingly sharp almost like it was just filmed. It actualy gave it more of a better feel with it being black and white I barely noticed the black bars of the sides. This reminded me of a few David lynch movies eraserhead and lost highway.. Which is great because finding movies that remind me of lynch is very hard because he's so genious. I live now to find movies like this that are so artistically brilliant. That dude creeped me out that kept popping up . And I loved the ending . Good films don't need 1,000,000,000 dollars to make.  This will be a movie i cherish my whole life. It should be noted this was the directors only film he made **;this is how i like movies
8;17.0;5.0;6.0;807;"I love this movie.  I first saw it as a child, and it scared the daylights out of me.  I've watched it many times over the years, and it still impresses me with its eerie atmosphere.  The director's use of light and shade, of empty spaces, and of the feeling of isolation in the main character are on a par with any films made by the likes of the so-called ""great"" directors.  And he did it for a fraction of the cost.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the feeling of film, and is not impressed by (or is sick of) the blood-and-guts approach to horror.  I do want to say I don't like the artwork of the cover nearly so much as I did the original cover (which features Candace Hilligoss in black and white imagery).  Still, I'm glad to own this DVD.";CARNAVAL OF SOULS:  MOST THAN JUST A CULT FILM
9;37.0;1.0;5.0;1562;"First off, I love ""Carnival of Souls."" Although it's riddled with mistakes, I still find it to be a very creepy movie.\n\nSo why did I get this one--complete with irreverent commentary?  Mainly out of curiosity--I wanted to see the colorized version. A very bad idea. The film's gloominess and sense of disconnectedness disappears with the splashy colors. Listening to Mike Nelson's running commentary was even worse, and not because I ""worship"" the original. His jokes just fell flat, likely because he did the job solo -- no 'bots on this one. The interplay among the characters on MST3K made the humor much more successful.\n\nLive and learn, I guess. I'll stick with my Criterion edition.";A bad idea (I'm reviewing the COLORIZED version)
10;27.0;5.0;7.0;1893;"Gorgeous blond woman drives off a bridge with her friends into the river.\nShe somehow walks out of the water, even though her three friends drowned.\nA series of very strange happenings begin, including seeing a ghoulish face\nsuddenly in front of her at odd times.\n\nA huge abandoned carnival pavilion figures prominently in this as well as an old boarding house where she rents a room.  The one other tenant turns out to be the biggest creep in the world, leering, sneering and pushing himself on her constantly.  That guy alone made my skin crawl.  No one in the history of the movies has ever portrayed a slimey creep better.\n\nPipe organs also are an important element, as the lady is a professional organist.  She suddenly is compelled to stop playing church music and begins to play scarey horror movie music on the church organ which causes the preacher to fire her with a stern lecture on playing the wrong kind of music.\n\nEvery character in this movie is spooky in a very natural way, vaguely reminding me of every creepy old or young guy I ever met.  The yucky old men lecture her sternly, feeling like they must let her know they are superior morally, including a doctor who wants to ""help"" her by playing her psychiatrist.\nThe young sleazeball in the room across from her is manipulating for all he's worth, saying ""you must not like me very much"", ""you're very cold, you must not like men"", ""this room of yours is very lonely at night, I'd be happy to keep you company"", and on and on, leering, peeking at her through the door, showing up unexpectedly, bringing her coffee as soon as he hears her alarm go off in the morning, and totally pushing himself on her unmercifully.\nHe is a perfect charicature of a creep, finally running away saying ""I don't need to get mixed up with a crazy lunatic like you"".\n\nAnd then there's that ghoulish face appearing suddenly, looking through her window.\nI had at least four instances of goosebumps, the hairs on my arms standing on end, as I watched this.  I can't remember when a movie did that to me.\nThis movie was written with not only an astute concept of what may happen after death, but also with an accurate portrayal of some types of characters that can be found in the real world that make a girl's skin crawl.\nOne of the most genuinely horrifying movies I've ever seen.  The setting, mood and atmosphere are guaranteed to give you chills.";Gave me multiple goosebumps
11;29.0;5.0;7.0;2069;"Unconventional intro with no credits, jumps right into the action: the drag race down industrial America's early dirt roads, the old bridge, and the spooky music and ""Carnival of Souls"" opening title card. Beautiful. Wondrous early scenes of organ-ism with the reverend who looks like Al Gore, and the prophetic words ""Thank you, but I'm never coming back."" On the road, cheerful music turns to spooky organ music, the beautiful driver turns on a light to illuminate herself (something no driver would ever do), and then sees her first scary apparitions. Settlin' in at her new home, then sexxee bath scenes. The scene with the lecherous neighbour in the boarding house is practically scarier than the real fright-scenes. Scary wallpaper. ""I don't sleep so good as it is."" The landlady, a bit of a creep herself, brings up sandwiches for dinner with coffee. ""Coffee never keeps me awake."" And then we see her lying awake. And flirting with the lecherous/dimwitted neighbour. She slips into a negligee for some surreal shopping, and then down an escalator (symbolic) to check out the blissful netherworlds. Wandering around the spooky, deserted Saltair that she's oddly attracted to/repulsed by on a bright afternoon, taking in the amazing old architecture and space--tunnels, boardwalks with shadows coming through slated ceiling, a billboard woman that looks like her, so many beautiful screen captured. Great shadow-in-doorway photography, walking though the long shadows of the old dance floor in disarray and ruin, a solitary old space on the waterfront, Betty Blue with only Betty and no Zorg. Crazy dirge, 1920s dancers, morning turns to night, scary organ music. ""Your lack of soul.""\n\n  - I hope she does leave.\n  - I hope she can.\n\nIn some ways the film has some really bad acting, terrible dialogue delivery. ""But my dear... you cannot live in isolation from the human race, you know!"" But who cares--Candace Hildigloss (what a name!) is stunning in a glamorous 50s girl-next-door sort of way.\n\nThe amazing Saltair pavilion, which was in disrepair even in 1962 when the film was made, was in many ways the ideal location for a film like this--it had been built in 1893, but had been closed in the late 1950s (even after several resurrections). It is practically the star of the film itself.  Saltair once had the world's largest indoor dance floor, capable of supporting 2,000 dancing couples and two orchestras. The lake receded, then it flooded. Saltair burned to the ground twice.\n\nWith so many scenes that show parked cars, driving, racing, in-car shots, going into the auto shop, the car is very central to the movie. There some great, spacious interior shots and you really have to wonder how they captured them. Sinister voice says ""eastbound bus now loading, Gate Nine."" Eastbound, like over the river Jordan? ""Why can't anybody hear me?"" as she runs through the town. Can hear her own footsteps and the organ, but nothing else, until the birds chirp, and then the nightmare is over. Scary ghost dances with she, herself. Early Goths. She blends with herself at the end. The psychiatrist and the cleric give each other a deep meaningful look.\n\nThe Criterion Collection version comes in two versions: the 78-minute theatrical release, and an 83-minute director's cutcomes with gorgeous extras:\n\n- a 39-minute reel of outtakes\n- a 28-minute documentary on the film done by a Kansas TV station\n- a sideshow that included the instructional ""Saltair: A History of Isolation"" and ""Saltair photo gallery."" These demonstrate Saltair through the ages, going from a 1892 architectural drawing, through the glory days in the 1920s when it brought in 500,000 people a year, down to the decay of the early 1960s. ""Three hundred tons of steel girders supported the large dome, which was similar in size and shape to the Mormon Church's Tabernacle on Salt Lake City's Temple Square."" After many ups and downs, the place burned to the ground in November, 1970. There is both a timeline-slideshow that includes postcards from all ages of Saltair and a regular slideshow of pictures, mainly of the 1920s heyday, when the lake was full of revellers.\n- samples of Herk Harvey's Centron Films documentaries ""Star 34', ""Centron Commercial"", ""Signals: Read `em or Weep"", ""To Touch A Child"", ""Jamaica, Haiti and the Lesser Antilles"" and ""Korea: Overview.""\n- a 4:42 minute documentary from KTWU Channel II called ""The Carnival Tour"" that showed where the film was made, which was mainly in Lawrence, Kansas. The intersection at 23rd and Iowa is now the area where the drag race started. Dirt roads have been paved to become Clinton Parkway, and the Lacompton Bridge, where the car dropped into the Iowa river, has been rebuilt. The Reuter Organ Company where there were some organ-playing centre is in Lawrence, and many of the rooms there had not changed at the time the news report was filmed. The boarding house the Mary Henry character stayed at is at 6th and Louisiana, and so is the exterior is used. The church that Mary played at is at Kenton and Vermont in Lawrence Kansas, which uses the interior, the organ loft (with Reuter organ) and the stained glass windows, such as the one that says ""cast out devils."" The doctor's office was on a sound stage. Included is also the cool ""She was a stranger among the living"" poster.\n- a 2:16 theatrical trailer for the film. ""They demand that they dance with her at the Carnival of Souls. She whirls between the real and the unreal, trying to cling to life. She must dance for the carnival of souls held just for her, for they have come for her for the last time - claiming her as one of their own.""\n- Illustrated interviews, which are previously printed interviews that include vintage memorabilia and photos.

12;36.0;4.0;6.0;2243;"I saw this at least 45 years ago and was so horrified that it stuck in my mind like a nightmare.  I have literally not seen it since then and was anticipating seeing it with great delight.  I can say without reservation that this is one of the best b-horror films that I have ever seen:  the actors are unknowns and often not that good, but there is a consistent mood of terror and morbid curiosity throughout.\n\nAn inhibited girl is in a accident that occurred while recklessly racing boys.  Somehow, after 3 hours submerged, she appears to the astonishment of the cops who are looking for the car.  From the get-go,  she senses that something is wrong, but decides to go to a new job across the country without visiting her parents first.  On the way, she starts seeing things, in particular a recognizable face.  Upon arrival, she feels this terrible unease, the whole place seems alien and almost threatening.  She meets a lively, somewhat drunken boy who rooms across the hall, a kind of connection to life that she feels is vital yet cannot accept.  Their alienation, after a brief mating dance, is very sad.\n\nStrange things keep happening.  She develops a fascination with an abandoned amusement park, which she feels compelled to explore alone.  After a strange interlude where she appears to no longer exist - no one can hear or see her - she meets a stiff psychotherapists who tries to help but asks the wrong questions.  He concludes that she is ""unusually strong willed"".\n\nShe is a church organist on her first job.  Her music forms an integral part of the horrific atmospherics of the film, indeed she loses control and improvises a bizarre tune with swirling, uncontrolled hands as images of dancing corpses - so similar to the tubercular melancholy of Munch's Nordic paintings - overwhelm her.  I have seen this image in my nightmares ever since.  Her soulless music disturbs the priest who hired her:  he is the other moral pole opposite the psychotherapist.  As she begins to accept that she doesn't belong in the town, the menacing otherworlders began to appear in full daylight, at times she has fleeting visions or herself among them.  It bores straight into the viewers subconscious fear of the mysteries of death.  I will not reveal the ending.\n\nRecommended with enthusiasm.  There is a reason this is called a cult classic.";cult horror, like living inside of a Munch painting
13;38.0;4.0;6.0;2477;"As a lifelong devotee of the horror film, I can unequivocably state that this is one of the most creepy films I have ever seen. For sheer atmosphere, perhaps only the original Night of the Living Dead comes close. The fact that it is shot in black and white adds much to its power.\n\nUnlike today's horror, which relies overmuchly on depictions of limbs being torn off, bare-midriffed female protagonists, fountaining gore and everyone using four-letter-words several times per sentence, this film here strips things down to the bare bone and gives one a dose of pure psychological horror completely devoid of so much of one frame of cheesy CGI! Amazing! This, my friends, is HOW IT IS DONE. The ""it"" in question being, scaring you to death.\n\nImages from this film will stay with you after it is over. Long before the end of the film it is obvious that the protagonist is doomed; all that remain are the details and they are upsetting indeed. Eerie, sad, and yet subtle... the essence of alienation. And oh yeah... a great example of why looking out of windows after dark is a REALLY bad idea >:-) I am rating four stars only because of some minor flaws such as too much screen time being devoted to stuff like people packing suitcases and driving, etc. I hope they never seriously remake this; a classic should not be messed with unless it can be done better, and I seriously doubt that it can. This is a must-see for fans of the horror genre.";Unutterably creepy.
14;15.0;5.0;11.0;2665;"WARNING: Some spoilers ahead\n\nThis single Carnival Of Souls (1962) DVD contains both the original black-and-white movie and a colorized version as well.  If you're in the mood for color, watch the color version.  If you want the black-and-white original, it's here, too.  When it comes to cult classics of the horror genre, I lump Carnival Of Souls into the same category as Night Of The Living Dead (1968).  This movie had an extremely low budget - it was made for $30,000, or $17,000, depending on the source.  Whatever it was, it was dirt cheap to make.  But in my opinion, sometimes low budget movies are better than the polished big budget movies with top-of-the-line actors and special effects.  When it comes to horror movies, a small amount of money can produce the same desired result as big budget movies, which is to scare the audience.  The goal is to create an eerie and spooky and scary atmosphere that taps into a person's feelings of fear.  You really don't need a lot of money to accomplish this.  A lot of low budget B horror movies are very effective.  Carnival Of Souls is one of them.\n\nThis movie was shot in Lawrence, Kansas and also at the Saltair Pavilion amusement park in Salt Lake City, Utah.  This movie stars Candace Hilligoss as Mary Henry, a church organist who survives a car accident in which her two girl companions died.  Throughout the movie, she often sees the ghostly image of a man (played by director Herk Harvey) practically everywhere she goes.  This man seems to be haunting her.  Nobody else but her sees this man.  It isn't long before she seems to become non-existent to the people around her, all of whom don't see or hear her.  Mary seems to be scared of unknown forces throughout the movie.  It also seems as if what is living and what is dead is a blur to her.  She can't tell the difference.  She basically is caught between the living and the dead.  She is even haunted by her own organ music, which changes from happier tones early in the movie to more sinister and darker tones while she's practicing at the church one night.  It seems as though ever since she saw the Saltair Pavilion for the first time, she became drawn to it.  The end of the movie has a bizarre ending that I won't reveal.  Watch it to find out what happens.\n\nThis movie's score is 100% theater organ, performed by Gene Moore.  That's it - an organ.  The organ music is eerie throughout the movie and seems to be off key a lot of the time (intentionally, of course) and has an underlying, subtle carnival melody during a lot of the scenes at the pavilion.  I must say I'm surprised that Candace Hilligoss only appeared in one other movie (The Curse Of The Living Corpse in 1964).  She is nice looking, has very good screen presence, and can act pretty well.\n\nThis movie can be classified as having subtle, atmospheric psychological horror.  This movie has no blood and gore.  Instead, the music, camera angles, lighting, howling winds, shadows, moonlight, clouds, and feeling of emptiness make this movie creepy.\n\nThis movie has been influential to many horror movie makers, including George Romero, David Lynch and John Carpenter.  Notice how the ghoul (the man who keeps haunting Mary) appears in windows and then disappears.  Michael Myers does the same thing in Halloween (1978).\n\nThe audio commentary by Mike Nelson of TV's ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is obnoxious and useless.  He's a funny guy, but his commentary is pointless for this DVD release.\n\nDo you like low budget B horror movies that are influential cult classics?  Do you like simplicity when it comes to horror movies?  Do you like horror movies involving carnivals?  If so, then check out Carnival Of Souls and buy this DVD where you get both black-and-white and color.";You get the original black and white film, also a colorized version of this 1962 cult classic!
15;19.0;1.0;11.0;2796;Anybody who has ever seen this film needs no warning to stay as far away from this DVD as possible. It is a moody horror classic that induces nightmares as few other films can do, but much of that comes from the truly creepy black & white photography. Colorizing it would absolutely ruin it, but Legend is a company that specializes in ruining B&W public domain films by colorizing them, as if we're too stupid to enjoy a film with its original cinematography. There are wonderful versions of Carnival of Souls out there - it's good enough that you should seek them out, particularly the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD. But this one? Garbage.;Another insult from Legend
16;54.0;4.0;5.0;3058;I love this movie!  I saw this film a while ago (the Criterion Collection edition) and was amazed by the interesting storyline.  And the film is just over an hour so it's a fast paced story.\n\nHerk Harvey and John Clifford came up with an interesting concept: Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) gets into what should have been a fatal car accident during a drag race.  She is uneasy in town, but she is leaving anyways to take a job as a church organist (although to her its just a job and the church is a place of business).  On her way there, she is stalked by a ghostly/ghastly man (scarily played by Herk himself).  She becomes even more paranoid when it appears as though people treat her like she doesn't exist.  The story comes to a thrilling conclusion with visually stunning scenes at the old carnival.\n\nI cannot explain why I like this film, I just do.  I think the colorization is actually well done.  I have yet to listen to the humorous commentary so I cannot rate that.  Although, if you have the extra money I would go for the Criterion Collection: the film is cleaned up so the great cinematography at the end is crisp, as well as having the director's cut.\n\nBut this copy more than satisfies my cult obsession with a low budget masterpiece.  Highly recommend!!;More than a Cult Classic
17;42.0;5.0;6.0;3302;"Get ready, `cause this is gonna get complicated (real fast, lol).\n\nOkay, so you have both Criterion and Image Entertainment releasing the same movie in the same year; a film that until then, had only known cruddy, ""Public Domain"", hell (on TV, $0.99 VHS and $1.99 DVD's) and with pretty much the same remastered picture quality, right?\n\nWell here's where it gets very odd; the, Criterion set, has two versions of the film, a 78 minute theatrical version and an 83 minute Director's Cut, where as the Image Entertainment DVD has a running time of 82 minutes (note: all of the actual discs, corroborate, the DVD cases, printed running times).\n\nSo, one would assume that the Image disc, was culled from the same print used to create the Criterion, Director's Cut, seeing as the run times are so close, and as previously mentioned, the prints look very much the same...\n\n...but you would be wrong.\n\nThe reason being, is that both of the Criterion versions have a scene near the beginning of the film where a police/detective, person, is interviewing the driver of the second car in the opening drag race, asking the driver his version of the events on the bridge, but this scene is absent from the Image version.\n\nNow granted, this is a little 10 second scene, but it dose rise the question as to where Image got this pristine print from (as there are no restoration notes on the Image packaging) and why does it very from the theatrical version in this one scene (possibly others as well, but I've yet to do any serious, frame-by-frame, comparisons to all three films because, well, I do have a life, lol).\n\nThe scene in question is actually quite redundant, as we already have witnessed the events on the bridge, and know what happened, and it's non-inclusion in the Image version is seamlessly done, making it look, for all the world, like the scene was an added scene for the Director's Cut of the, Criterion version, but since this scene is also in the theatrical cut, one has to wonder (once again) where the Image print came from (and how much more is different between the three versions, for that matter).\n\nThen there's the running time issues, as you would assume that the Image DVD would be the theatrical cut (possibly licensed from Criterion to provide a cheap alternative to the Criterion set, as was done with the movie, Zombi, which both Blue Underground and Shriek Show paid to have the film restored, and one put out a low priced, movie only DVD at the same time that the other put out a two disc special edition version) but where as the theatrical cut is 78 minutes, and it's Director's Cut is 83 minutes, the Image disc is 82 minutes (and is missing at least one scene that both the theatrical and Director's Cuts have).\n\nThis is curious, and just thought that fans might want to know, or might even have some ideas, as to the nature of the Image DVD.";CRITERION vs. IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT DVD (FANS WILL WANT TO CHECK THIS OUT)
18;39.0;1.0;7.0;3782;The Criterion 2-disc edition is far superior in image and sound quality to this release and, most importantly, is the only one endorsed by the surviving creators.

Plus you get the two original versions of the film, neither of which are colorized.;AVOID THIS RELEASE!
19;48.0;5.0;6.0;3808;"I first saw this film on video when it was ""somewhat"" restored in the 1980's.  Of course, it had the cult reputation of a long unseen film, and seeing it the first time was a bit of a letdown.  But when Criterion released it in this deluxe 2 DVD edition, I decided to try again.  I am very happy I did.  This is a real gem, disquieting, scary, incredibly atmospheric, and haunting (no pun intended).  I have always loved horror films that are quiet, that get inside your head, and really play around with your consciousness.  Films like that are The Sixth Sense, Kwaidan, Daughters of Darkness, Dreyer's Vampyr, the films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure, the original Pulse), and this film too.  They don't smash you over the head with violence and gore.  They end up disturbing you in ways you can't really explain.  As some reviewers have noted, Herk Harvey, the director, made only one feature film in his life, and this is it.  He was an industrial filmmaker who worked at Centron Corporation in Lawrence, Kansas (where much of this film was shot) all his life.  He made over 400 industrial films (those cheesy, ""how to"" films that get parodied to death on TV).  Harvey said he wanted to make a film with ""the look of a Bergman film, and the feel of a Cocteau one"", and he did.  There is much to like about this work.  The organ score is exceptionally creepy, the photography is very good considering how low budget the film was, and the Pavillion where we see the souls dancing is one of the best locations I've ever seen for a film.  A note to burgeoning filmmakers:  to save money, shoot at a place that has been abandoned, but has great atmosphere (Kubrick did this with Full Metal Jacket.  Hue City was actually an abandoned gas works outside London).  Some of the acting here is rather amateurish, but it doesn't really bother me too much.  Candance Hilgegrass is actually good, playing a cold, dispassionate woman.  Her performance is rather off putting, but it works rather well here.  Some of Harvey's industrial films are included on this set, and they're so incredibly cheesy.  You can probably safely skip them.  While this film didn't do rather well at first, I'm glad it got rediscovered, and Harkey got the credit he deserved.  Make sure you buy the Criterion edition.  There are some public domain copies floating around here, and they are more than likely horrible.";A great nightmare...

23;6.0;5.0;25.0;3894;"Carnival of Souls is one of my favorite kinds of movie -  the low budget horror film that manages to unnerve, and create a world of mystery and possibilities despite - and sometimes even because of - its lack of funding.  It's the only feature film made by the late Herk Harvey, and despite a lackluster initial release, it has become increasingly popular over the years. It ponders the question - when the emotionally dead actually die, do they even notice?\n\nOne of the director's best decisions was to take a considerable amount of his meager budget and spend it on a quality yet unknown leading actress in Candace Hilligoss.  She certainly was perfect for the lead role of Mary Henry. She is excellent at portraying someone who is emotionally hollow who has ironically chosen something that generally attracts people of passion - music - as a profession. In the hands of a less able actress, Mary's largely deadpan demeanor would have simply appeared to be the work of an actress who was unclear about her motivation. Harvey knew instinctively that poor acting in a low budget horror film always takes the viewer out of the proper element and instead makes the film campy - which is definitely not a word that describes this movie.\n\nThe film opens when a car filled with guys challenges a car filled with girls to a drag race.  Drag races in movies rarely yield anything but tragic outcomes, and in this case, the girls' car plunges off the side of a bridge and disappears into the murky river below.  As the local law enforcement attempt to drag the river, complaining because of its current height and low visibility that the car might never be found, one of the victims, Mary Henry, crawls out of the water, covered in muck and obviously in a stupor, but physically unharmed.  She remembers nothing about the accident. In spite of this tragedy, she continues with her plans to move west to Salt Lake City, where she's been offered a job as a church organist.  While on the trip west an eerie ghoulish face and figure, who looks a lot like Uncle Fester of the Addams Family, begins to appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as suddenly, and nobody seems able to see him except for her.\n\nShe takes a boarding room just down the hall from John (Sidney Berger), who quickly tries to put the moves on her with all of the finesse of a pimply-faced high school sophomore.  Berger was always proud of the fact that film critic Roger Ebert called him ""the definitive portrait of a nerd in lust"".  Mary sometimes rejects John, but sometimes welcomes his company just because she's beginning to fear being alone, considering the random appearances of the ghoulish figure. Mary is not the kind of person who needs people for companionship. Instead, unless they fulfill a concrete requirement like a car or a coffeemaker, or in John's case something that wards off the ghoul that stalks her, she is largely indifferent to their presence.\n\nAn abandoned carnival ground on the outskirts of town catches Mary's attention, and she begins to be drawn toward it, as though that strange setting might offer some sort of answer to her mystery.  What follows is two terrific set pieces, one involving her practicing her music in church only to be overcome by visions and a mysterious power that turns her playing into something `profane' that gets her fired from her job, and the first of two eerie scenarios where Mary seems to have become invisible and inaudible to all around her. The ending might have been considered surprising in 1962, but today it's pretty obvious from the beginning what is probably going on. In this movie, however, the entertainment is in the journey, not the destination.\n\nWhat Harvey lacked in finances for special effects, he more than made up for in atmosphere, which cost him monetarily little or nothing.  His undead creatures are startling to look at, and the way he films their bizarre, macabre dances is both strange and unnerving.  When he claimed his influences were Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman, he wasn't kidding.  Fans of those directors will notice how much homage is paid to them in this film, and how much those were the right two filmmakers to emulate to create the surreal mood of this particular picture.  Also, the unforgettable organ score by Gene Moore is perfect for adding just the right mood to this film.\n\nThe original version of the picture had five minutes cut out of it by Harvey's distributor, simply to make the movie fit better on a double feature billing.  With this DVD, you can compare that version with the restored director's cut, and I believe that the latter is definitely the better one.  Most of what was cut came from two scenes near the end, the second adventure of invisibility for Mary, and the final confrontation at the carnival grounds.  Harvey's version is decidedly creepier, with a much better flow to it.\n\nCarnival of Souls was one of the first truly good low-budget out-of-the-mainstream classic horror films. The next one would be 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"" by George Romero. This movie proves that talent, vision, and imagination can triumph over funding to create something lasting, memorable, and unique. Who would have thought that a film that cost only $30K to make would have people talking philosophically about the dividing line between life and death over 40 years later?  How many of the films made in the last five years that cost $100 million to make will have the same effect on audiences 40 years from now?  I doubt many if any will.";When the emotionally dead actually die, do they even notice?

25;59.0;4.0;5.0;3934;"Two cars drag race on a desolate stretch of road in rural Kansas.  One car runs off a bridge, plunges into a deep river and quickly sinks.  All three young women inside are assumed dead.  However, hours after the crash, one woman emerges from the river, alive and unharmed, but unable or unwilling to explain her miraculous survival.\n\nThat intriguing premise, ladies and gentlemen, is merely the pre-credits opening sequence of CARNIVAL OF SOULS.\n\nI hadn't heard of this movie before.  However, quick trips to IMDB and Wikipedia tell me that I should have.  It was an cheap, obscure, throwaway flick when it was first released, but has gained a cult following in the decades since.  And it's easy to see why.  Because despite its flaws, there is a lot of atmosphere and horror here.\n\nThe story follows Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), the young woman inexplicably left alive when all reason would indicate that she be dead.  Following the accident, she leaves town as she has been hired as a church organist in Utah.  During her trip, she is haunted by bizarre and unexplainable visions.  After her arrival, the sightings continue and she finds herself drawn to a mysterious, abandoned carnival.  Also, despite making a serious impression on a man living in her building, she begins temporarily slipping out of reality, unable to make herself seen or heard by those around her.\n\nI'm not the first (nor will I be the last) to notice that CARNIVAL OF SOULS has the definite feel of a lost, elongated episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE (indeed, it contains similar themes to ""The Hitchhiker"", although CARNIVAL is creepier and has more going on).  This is very atmospheric, very creepy and unsettling.  It's the kind of movie you watch and then don't want to look out of dark windows at night because if you don't look, you won't have to see what's out there.\n\nI liked that the central character is both an identification point (we, like her, want to discover what is going on around her) and a enigmatic mystery.  How did she survive the car crash?  That event must have something to do with her visions, but what is the connection?  Why is she drawn to the carnival?\n\nOf course, I found it difficult to watch CARNIVAL without being distracted by the cheap production values and numerous technical flaws.  While occasionally the mistakes add to the atmosphere of confusion, overall they can't help but detract from the film as a whole.  Keep in mind that this film gets a lot of attention based on how good it is despite its flaws.  So don't go into it expecting perfection.\n\nHowever, those flaws almost enhance the genuinely effective moments, because they seem to rise like roses out of, well, if not manure, than certainly ordinary film making.  There are many creepy individual shots I'll remember, most of which concern the unnerving ghostly apparitions.  Sometimes simple, primitive special effects are more chilling than there expensive counterparts, and the shots of the specters stalking the protagonist are clear evidence of that.\n\nI really enjoyed the ending of the film.  Sometimes a script will attempt to explain too much, leaving the movie feeling a little too neat.  Other times, the producers will leave things so vague as to render any coherent theory impossible.  CARNIVAL hit the magic median for me.  I got a lot out of the ending, and was happy to see that while there are numerous theories on-line ""explaining"" the conclusion, not one of them exactly lines up with my own.  I like that about a film.\n\nThe inexpensive Digiview Productions release of this DVD is quite watchable, and while I'm sure the Criterion version has a vastly superior picture, this is great for people like me who are discovering this for the first time.";"""I don't belong in the world..."""

29;32.0;5.0;9.0;4113;"""I don't belong in the world....something separates me from other people"" says Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) in perhaps the most lyrical horror film ever made. It is the unlikely 1962 masterpiece ""Carnival of Souls"" which philosophically fleshes out the premise of ""Twilight Zone's"" ""The Hitch Hiker"" episode (January 1960). The one where Inger Stevens (as Nan Adams) plays a young woman driving cross country who keeps passing the ""same"" man standing by the side of the road. Its masterpiece quality was unlikely because it was the low budget first feature film of Herk Harvey (a director of educational short films), using actors with little acting for the camera experience, and with a story structure adapted to fit sets and locations to which Harvey had free access.\n\nOne of these locations was an organ factory. This not only dictated the film's unique and beautiful score but it suggested a profession for the main character (Mary Henry), a church organist. With this they really got lucky because it brings in many disturbing religious images and undertones. A church organist seemingly possessed by her instrument, as her playing alternates between the spiritual and the profane, deeply disturbs her wrapped-too-tight"" minister who would have benefited from Pollyanna's advice about the ""rejoicing texts"". The organ factory also serves nicely for a Carol Reed-type angular crane shot with the huge organ pipes in the foreground and the diminutive figure of Hilligoss far below. This early shot sets the existential tone for what will follow. Finally, there is the moment when she is alone on the highway and her radio will only pick up organ music.\n\nThe other location is the abandoned Saltair Pavilion outside Salt Lake City. Much of the story takes place here as Mary Henry is mysteriously drawn to the place. Watch for this shot of her in front of a promotional poster for the Pavilion, on the poster is a look-alike blonde with the same hairstyle. Since the late 19th century, Saltair had been a family swimming/recreational facility built out into the Great Salt Lake. The huge pavilion looks like a strange cross between an Eastern Orthodox church and an Arabian Nights palace. The falling lake level doomed the swimming feature but the place operated as an amusement park until abandoned five years before the filming of ""Carnival of Souls"". At the time of filming the actual pealing paint, broken glass, collapsed staircases, and general disorder made for a better location than even the best production designer could have constructed. It also works well from a ""language of film"" symbolic perspective as Mary is shown walking through an unnatural circular passage, which reinforces other subtles off-kilter elements that occur throughout the film.\n\nWhile much of the film's texture was the happy result of the low budget necessity of using these available locations, the casting of Hilligoss worked out even better. Probably cast because she was the most beautiful actress available for the price, Harvey hit a home run because she brings exactly the right sterile and distanced qualities that the film needs in its main character. Hilligoss might have been an acting-for-the-camera novice but she had extensive stage experience. Harvey was able to get an extraordinary nonverbal performance from her, unexpectedly taking the film deep into the concept of human alienation. Much like ""The Incredible Shinking Man"", with its existential theme of separation from society, ""Carnival of Souls"" also transcends its genre and explores the isolation of someone who feels they no longer belong. And like ""TISM"", the resolution is the realization that loss of identity is freedom, that the infinite and the infinitesimal are the same, that you are not alone because you are a part of something bigger.\n\nThe two occasions where Mary Henry suddenly becomes invisible to everyone are much more vivid because Hilligoss is so beautiful. Unlike a person of average appearance, an especially beautiful woman walking down the street is used to drawing stares from virtually everyone. For such a person the phenomenon of sudden invisibility would be far more jarring than for those who are used to not being noticed in the passing crowd.\n\nFor budget reasons, egg white was used on the faces of the ""dead"" cast members, including Harvey himself who plays Mary's recurring apparition. This has an especially eerie effect with black and white film and would be adopted a few years later by George Romero for ""Night of the Living Dead"".\n\nEducational film veteran Frances Feist plays Mary's cherubic landlady and John Linden plays her slimy (on the make) neighbor. Both are excellent, and the disjointed and stilted acting style of their scenes with Hilligoss will remind many viewers of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".\n\nThen again, what do I know? I'm only a child.";Way Ahead of Its Time

The first organ chords that open the film with shots of the river's murky surface foreshadow a later diegetic appearance of the same music.  The magnified sound of the boards of the fateful wooden bridge ratchet up the eeriness of the mood, and echo the distorted sound of Mary Henry's footsteps when, toward the end, in her last terrified flight through the town, the clacking of her heels on the street takes on a strange and unreal rhythm.\n\nAfter the accident, we see Mary Henry from above, from the point of view of the crowd on the bridge.  She crawls out of the muddy water where the police have been dragging for the car, which had earlier plunged from the bridge.  This is the first of many times that she is viewed from an overhead angle.  The second time we see her from such a height is at the organ manufacturing warehouse, from the balcony where several of the workers, lured away from their various jobs as if hypnotized by her music, have gathered to see her practicing.  In this scene we learn that she is leaving for Salt Lake City to take a job as a church organist.  The installation supervisor wishes her luck, and tells her: Put your soul into it a little OK? (Spot the low-budget dialog, OK...?)\n\nAn interesting sound device occurs next in the car, en route to Salt Lake City.  We discover that the music we hear is not coming from the radio as we had thought, because as she turns the dials, nothing happens.  The source of the music appears puzzling to her as well.  Hilligoss is stunning here - crazy-eyed, her face in ECU lit by otherworldly light.\n\n The film was made in 1962, and so we never see a pack of Marlboros or a can of Pepsi.  But when Mary Henry arrives at the rooming house in Salt Lake City and we meet the landlady, Mrs. Thomas, she happens to be carrying a can of Ajax - quite amusing!\n\nMost of the scenes are tense as Mary is often in claustrophobic spaces: inside her car, or with the cloying Mr. Linden, the neighbor, who continually forces into her space with his hands, face, and body.  Later, the minister too crowds her in the blocked area behind the organ.  The first peaceful scene is the one where she first visits the abandoned fairground, which inexplicably draws her.  Again we see her from high above when she enters the pavilion.\n\nProbably the most important scene in the film occurs when Mary visits the empty church to practice.  She starts out with all the correct organ music, pauses to look at her hands as if they don't belong to her, and resumes.  But now the music changes.  It becomes the haunted carnivalesque score building on what we'd heard briefly in the opening scene.  Gene Moore is credited with the music, and it's superb!  Has anything been written anywhere about this?  (Did it influence the opening of Led Zeppelin's ""Your Time is Gonna Come""?)  She's become one with the organ, and we see her bare feet floating over the pedals, rows of choir robes shiver disembodied on their hangers, we see images of clouds over the moon then reflected in the water, saints frozen in the stained glass, and dancers in the pavilion in compressed time.  I think this is really an amazing cinematic moment!  It ends when the minister bursts on this scene, horrified.  He's heard all this, and shrieks: Profane! Sacrilege! He blurts out that he pities her for her ""lack of soul"" and instantly banishes her from the church, firing her from her job as church organist forever.\n\nThere is a particularly sublime shot in the film to watch for. It occurs in the scene of Mary Henry's final visit to the pavilion.  There is a long shot of the ballroom dancers in the dark pavilion, embracing and motionless, entangled with the long dangling streamers.  This is count one.  Counts two, three, and four occur like this: the strings of lights illuminate, the music starts, and the dancers begin.  The lights, the music, and the motion occur with a cadence so deliberate and careful as though counted out by metronome, and as if to suggest that everything will happen in order, as it should.  No need to hurry, no need to run.  This time we see Mary from a low angle, the sky behind her instead of the ground.";Sound and Music Tell the Story
33;7.0;4.0;26.0;4557;"""Carnival of Souls"" is an odd, Twilight Zone-like movie in which a heady atmosphere compensates for an exceptionally uneven presentation. Yes, I know you've heard that about many other horror films, but ""Carnival of Souls"" is one of the few times where such a description is warranted. It's the atmosphere of the film - best likened to an eerie fever dream, that made ""Carnival of Souls"" a cult film. The often skillful black and white cinematography turns the often mundane - even banal - locations seem mysterious and even sinister. This doesn't turn the movie into a classic winner, but it does help explain why a public domain movie like this is still remembered today.\n\nVirtually the entire running time of ""Carnival of Souls"" is devoted to a moody young church organist (Candace Hilligoss) obsessed with a ruined amusement park not far from her church. Her odd behavior justifiably confuses her sleazy, wannabe boyfriend and as the film progresses her breaks with reality are more and more disjointed. This isn't a standard B-movie stocked full of scares, but a consistently odd, unnerving film. The ending, if anything is anticlimatic. Several scenes in which the organist is being pressured by her boyfriend (Sydney Berger) are actually far scarier than any of the supernatural elements in the film.\n\nThe Criterion DVD also includes generous documentaries, galleries, and a ""director's cut"" which share more than you need to know about this film. It pushes my rating of the film from 3 stars to four. It's nice to see a B-movie given this respect. However . . .\n\nThe main problem with the Criterion DVD is that, no matter how you frame it, this _is_ a DVD of an obscure, uneven B-movie. The cheezy electric, whirling organ score is only occassionally effective and there's little attempt to have Hilligoss mime convincingly to the music on those scenes when she is the organist. Most of the supporting actors are downright terrible, and the film's pacing drags at times. This isn't an ""art movie"" no matter what the pretensions of its creators. To be charged nearly 40 dollars for it (even though it has extras and is restored)is a bit excessive, not to mention insulting. If you're a purist, buy a used copy. If you're just want a copy of the film for your collection, there are plenty of other, more inexpensive, versions around, including a colorized one.";An eerie, disturbing fever dream . . .

Nothing was explained.\n\nI loved this film.\n\nI know, many of you are probably wondering why I loved a film that denounces everything I feel is needed in a film, but for some odd reason in this film it worked. This was a very scary movie. Not the kind of scary that you need blood or violence to make you jump, but the kind that the violins seemed to shrill your way to behind a pillow. I was really impressed that this film was released in 1962.  I would put money down that if this film were to be released today it would do really well.\n\nAs I watched this film, I made the comment that this could very well have been a Mystery Science Theater 3000 film.  There were certain elements to it that I could see Joel or the bots just making fun of.  So, in that sense, I am glad that I didn't see the film with those guys commenting through it, I may not have enjoyed it as much.  This was a film full of symbolism, of imagination, and of surprises.  I loved the way that Mary went from real life to when people couldn't hear or see her.  It showed that something supernatural was at work instead of just some crazy guy following her around. The carnival was spooky.  This is one of those films that you would put on at Halloween with a great bottle of wine and your best girl by your side.\n\nWithout giving too much away, I enjoyed how this film came to it's conclusion.  As the visions of the phantom man became greater and greater, it was obvious that the cops were getting closer and closer to finding the car.  I also enjoyed the fact that the ""undead"" of the film all came out of water to be reborn.  It was great foreshadowing to what would happen to Mary.\n\nThe director took many risks with the symbolism that he used, and it worked better than some films with today's CGI abilities.  You could tell as you watched this film that imagination was flowing with the writer of this film.  It proved that even without a budget you could make a film that would last the test of time, and even be remade over and over again. The surprises were easy, but fun.  I saw the ending of this film coming a mile away, but it still kept my attention.\n\nOverall, this film is like a great wine.  Imagine opening a bottle of merlot from 1962 and having the whole afternoon to enjoy it.  That is how I feel about this film.  A definite for anyone to have in their collection!!\n\nGrade: ***** out of *****";In the dark, your fantasies get so far out of hand.
36;56.0;3.0;6.0;4611;"This is a classic horror movie from 1962 filmed in Kansas, and at an abandoned theme park on the Great Salt Lake in Utah, ""Saltair."" There is now a colorized DVD available from Off-Color Films featuring a commentary track by Mike Nelson. I recommend the version with the commentary for vastly improved entertainment value.\n\nThe film itself is actually modestly creepy. It stars Candace Hilligoss as a schizophrenic, antisocial church organist with a major spiritual dilemma being taunted by beings from beyond the grave, led by Zombie-In-Chief, and also Director, Herk Harvey (famous for making many Centron educational shorts like ""Industrial Arts"" and ""Juvenile Delinquency."")\n\nThe plot is straightforward, and I won't reveal it here, but it involves drag racing, otherworldly (if not possessed) organ playing, and the creepiest boarding house in film history. The Off-Color DVD has several extras including the original trailer. I thought the movie was a tad better than Mike Nelson did, but while perhaps groundbreaking in 1962, it is tame if not boring in today's world. It is generally a credible effort with some genuine spookiness despite its dated appearance.\n\nAs an aside, the film makers decided on a soundtrack that was solo organ music, and the droning, buzzing noodling on the organ is extremely annoying in a very short while. It was evidently scored and performed by an organist who had not yet learned to play the organ.";Get That Cat Off The Organ!

It features both the original B/W and new Color version of the film, which is suprisingly accurate to both the locations and the mood of the film. It also has an audio commentary by Mike Nelson of MST3K. In addition, there is also an effective 5.1 channel DTS soundtrack.

39;45.0;4.0;7.0;4666;"Carnival of Souls was made on a shoe-string budget by industrial filmmaker Herk Harvey and stars the enigmatic and beautiful Candace Hilligoss as the lead character who manages to be constantly isolated from everyone around her.  There are so many excellent transitions and shots in the movie it was obvious that who ever put it together had been an excellent film editior at the very least.  As the film has been extensively reviewed here I want to focus on the DVD releases.  Aside from the original cut of the film, 82 minutes, there where several prints that had been trimmed down both by the director and perhaps for TV although I have seen the complete film on cable as well as edited versions.  The Image ""movie-only"" release (by the way Image also co-produced the Criterion Collection release) has the complete version of the movie and best print that I have seen.  There is an active menu with some of the spooky organ music with icons for chapters and the films trailer.  At first I thought the icon for ""recommendations"" was just a link to a one page marketing promo.  However, if you click on the title boxes you get a trailer for each of the other Image releases shown.  Quite a nice little ""Easter Egg""!\n  I am glad I have the other versions as well because I think the edited prints are also interesting.  The Alpha Video version actually has a slightly higher bit rate than the Image edition and only a tiny amount of pixelization here and there detracts from a very sharp picture, it clocks in at 77 minutes and is a great bargain.  The Diamond DVD release has an identical running time, but a lower bit rate and still some pixelization in a couple of scenes.  However considering that you get a copy of 1960's ""Horror Hotel"" with Christopher Lee included it is a great buy for just a few bucks.  Curiously, the Diamond edition ""Carnival of Souls/""Horror Hotel"" is supposedly out of print yet I found a copy in a store recently and got another new copy on-line for my little brother's collection.  Goodtimes has released ""Carnival of Souls"" with a high bit rate and sharp picture but a few more skips and pops.  Also, the running time is the shortest, 75 minutes, as it cuts out a couple more scenes such as when Candace Hilligoss stops for gas and directions entering Salt Lake City.  However, my Goodtimes edition is a two sided disc with ""Carnival"" on one side and a decent print of ""Night of the Living Dead"" on the other.  For those of you who don't like two sided discs, Goodtimes has also released both films seperately for just a few bucks each.  Criterion Collection has released the utlimate edition with two cuts of the film and loads of extras including a commentary.  However, it you are on a budget you do have other options.  So make some popcorn and enjoy the show.  Thanks, CAL";Disturbing and Creepy cult classic comes to DVD!!!
40;28.0;4.0;11.0;4703;"Carnival of Souls is the horror movie Albert Camus might have made.  It's a lot like George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead - -  black and white, low-budget, a simple horror story that's really about human beings' isolation in their own skins.\nThe acting ensemble in Romero's film is consistently better, but Carnival of Souls only has one real character, and Candace Hilligoss as Mary is very good.  It's probably only her performance that has kept this movie around for over forty years.\nIt's 1962 in a small town, and two young guys in a hot rod and three young women in another car are drag racing.  They get to the bridge outside of town, finally going fast enough to feel alive when . . .\n. . . Mary crawls out of the river, covered in mud, the only female survivor.  The other two girls paid the price for giving in to the thrill of the boys' challenge.\nSeemingly unaffected (almost in the clinical sense of being without affect), Mary follows her plan to go to another small town where she's been hired as a church organist.  She doesn't believe in the church, though; she's a musician and playing the organ is just a job.\nMary's drive to her new town is the scariest bit of filmmaking I've seen in a long time.\nTrying to settle into her new life, Mary starts to crack up.  Besides seeing an apparition connected to an old ruined carnival, Mary is suddenly unable to hear the people around her.\nThree men say they want to help her - - a would-be boyfriend who's only interested in sex and leaves her when she lets her despair show, a doctor who violently shakes her and orders her to his office for his expert help, and the minister she works for who fires her when something possesses her and she ""profanes"" his church with carnival music.  Love, science, and God all fail her.\nIf Mary had only been able to hang on for five or ten years, maybe she would have found more satisfying work, or support from other women, or been stronger herself.  In 1962 Mary felt the nothingness eating her alive, but she couldn't see a way out in time.  She lost the race.";"""I'm not taking vows.  I just play the organ."""

The Sci-Fi Channel was having nightly film festivals in October leading up to Halloween and when I saw the promo for Carnival of Souls, it gave me chills.  The next night I watched (and taped) it, and have viewed it many, many times since.\nNothing conveys terror like atmosphere and things barely seen.  Director Herk Harvey, whose previous film experience was almost entirely in industrial films, captured these important aspects perfectly.  In the supplemental materials on the Criterion DVD, he explains how the sight of the old Salt Lake bath house became the base for this film.  When you see the old bath house, it is at a distance at first, in the evening, draped in shadows.  You wonder ""What is in there?  Is it empty?  Or could something else be there that shouldn't be?""\nIn the film, Mary Henry (played by Candace Hilligoss) is the sole survivor of an auto accident.  Afterwards she leaves Kansas to take a job in Salt Lake City, Utah.  As she nears Salt Lake, she sees, in the distance, the shadowy hulk of an old pavilion on the lakeshore.  She begins seeing images of a pale faced man (played by director Harvey) appearing and disappearing outside her car, in her boarding house, outside her window, etc.  The film deals with her attempts to come to terms with this vision, her sanity, her brush with death, and what role the old building (a former bath house, carnival, and dance hall) has to do with it all.\nThe film looks crisp and clear, even in night scenes.  No surprise, also, that it has an industrial film feel to it at times.  The acting is good, but not great.  Then again the occasional stiffness of some characters adds to Mary Henry's feeling of disconnect with the living world.  The townspeople have barely more life in them than the pale ""zombies"" that rise from the lake.  Mary's job as a church organist allows for a soundtrack full of pipe organ music that morphs from inspirational to horrific.  It is quite effective and adds to the already dreamlike quality that oozes from the film.\nThe Criterion DVD comes with 2 discs including the original director's cut and the theatrical versions.  Extras include a booklet, a photo gallery and history of the bath house, and a panel interview at a convention featuring Herk Harvey (wearing his ghostly make-up no less!), Candace Hilligoss, and Sidney Berger, who played Mary Henry's (...) drunken neighbor.\nPeople spend millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars trying to scare you, and almost always fail.  Carnival of Souls succeeds and on a tiny budget.  There is a reason that this small film from 1962 is still a cult favorite today.  It works.  It's scary.  It will creep you out.

42;47.0;5.0;7.0;4784;"Carnival of Souls is a movie made, apparently, almost on a whim by two men who never made another feature film and stars an actress who was only in one other minor movie. With that sort of background, the rather unique finished product is maybe not so surprising. What is very surprising is that the movie turned out as well as it did.\nSome of the other reviews have compared it to the twilight zone, and that is maybe the closest thing. They are from the same time period and have overlapping themes. The plotting for Carnival, though, is loose and leaves you wondering if there was a point -something you could almost never say about the twilight zone. Is it, like another reviewer stated, a hyper literal portrayal of a woman rejecting all the things that make life worth while and becoming an actual lost soul? I don't know that the movie lets us know enough about Mary to come to that conclusion. (Maybe it's all just a dramatized depiction of an undead beauracrat correcting a paperwork mistake.)\nPlot, I don't think, is what this movie should stand or fall on.\nAtmosphere seemed to take precedence with the film's creators(the director, Herk Harvey, told his writer, John Clifford, that he didn't care what he wrote about, except that he wanted to make a movie that had dead people dancing under the Saltair dome).  From this point of view, I think, the movie is very successful. Carnival effectivly creates a tone of strangeness and dread that is sustained almost throughout it's length. It reminded me much more of the silent film, Nosferatu, than any modern horror movie (the nearly omnipresent pipe organ score might have something to do with that).\nCandace Hilligloss, who plays the main character, Mary, does an excellent job in her role as a brittle, eccentric young woman, right down to the hand and body movements. She also has the perfect looks for the part; doe eyed and blond, with long, pale hands that look like they were made for playing music (a church pipe organ, in this instance). It's a pity she wasn't in more movies (she, rather admirably, retired from films to raise her children). Another good actor who went on to do really nothing else on the big screen, Sidney Berger, has the only other very important speaking role in the film. He's also does quite well in a very unsympathetic part as Mary's slimy neighbor.\nThere's one scene in this movie that really sticks in mind; the one where Mary visits the deserted interior of Saltair for the\nfirst time. The scene has no real action, aside from Mary just walking around, but it's effect is quite eery ( it concludes in an utterly sinister shot, which may possibly have been what Peter Jackson was thinking of in the dead marshes sequence of The Two Towers). What I believe this scene trades on is the strangeness, the unwholesome sensation that comes of being alone in a large, festive, public place. A personal experience of mine which parallels this scene -I'm certain it's part of why this movie had such an effect on me-  is my memory of walking around the desserted ruins of the massive, domed Baden Springs luxury resort in Indiana (it's since been gloriously restored, apparently) when I was a kid back in the 80's. I've never quite forgotten the lonely and desolate sensation it inspired.\nHaving said all that, I don't believe it's a perfect movie by any means. There's bad acting from bit players, at least a few near camp moments, mostly at the beginning (I was nearly expecting, was almost afraid, that the deadly drag race at the start of the movie would veer into a wooden PSA from some beefy sheriff). I think how much of an impact this movie has on you will depend on when you watch it, who you watch it with (watch it alone), and whether you will allow yourself to get caught up in it's mood. There's no real violence, nothing that will involuntarily repulse you. If you want to give it the MST3K treatment, parts of the movie will certainly lend itself to that, or if you sit in front of the television, cross your arms and determine not to let this film get to you, then I think you will very probably stand up unfazed. Speaking personally, I think there are a number of things that I'll never quite look at again in the same light, after seeing this picture.";"sacred or profane;  it all sounds like organ music to me"

A woman is an innocent passenger in a car that gets into a drag race with some teenage thugs. The result is her car going over a bridge into a fast running, sandy river. As she crawls out of the wreckage covered in mud, the viewer thinks she has survived, but has she?\nMs. Hilligoss' character is a musician, an organist to be exact who takes a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Utah. As she begins her journey she is terrified of images of a phantom of sorts who seems to be seeking her out. Anyone who has driven for an average of twelve hours straight can tell you that driving can take its toll, and the mind can play tricks on a sleepy driver. However, after she checks into her room, she finds the same phantom lurking in the window, then in the hallway. Who is this creature, what does he want, where is he from?\nThe main point of the film is not horror, but human nature. Are we all alone in this world? Is everyone an island unto themselves. The lesson is thrown upon our character by a minister, a psychologist, and a would be male suitor. They all try to help her in their own way (except the suitor who is only interested in her for a chance to have sex). But our character waves a hand at them all, convinced that she can do it her own way. She is an independent woman who needs no man or companionship; a view that may have gone against society's thinking in 1962.\nThe male suitor (or `just your normal guy' as he likes to call himself) is an obnoxious oaf to say the least. His headstrong pursuit of her is only his own selfish desire to have her. He's not an alcoholic he claims, yet he drinks at dawn. He quit college because he doesn't like to learn. This is not an ideal resume for a long term relationship for her or any other woman. When she is truly frightened by the visiting spectre, and she reaches out to him as a last resort for help, he runs. Not wanting to get involved, he was only interested in her for her body and his own sexual desire. Yet another lesson in this film for all the young ladies who care to pay attention.\nAs the story goes on Candace's soul seems to deteriorate. She slips in and out of reality and a strange sort of parallel world. This dimension looks the same as real life, but she cannot be seen or heard. The department store dressing room for example, shows how the lost spirit must learn that she is no longer of this world, but now belongs in the spirit world, where yet another companion awaits her.\nWho is this man that haunts her in visions? We see at the end of the film that they are to be together forever. In the final seen where we see Candace's peek at her after-life. She screams in horror as the ghosts dance eternally as the haunt the carnival. She is finally captured by the ghosts and is spirited away. The police and minister are confused and baffled as her footprints and final body print leads nowhere. The minister gives a knowing look as if he has known all along, but says nothing.\nThe minister must have known there was something wrong with his new organist when he first met and eventually fired her. She had not the soul of a musician, she only had a knowledge for music. She was told this too by the organ builder in the beginning of the film. When she is possessed in the church and her true musician ship comes out as she plays without control, that is her true spirit, but the misinster fires her for `blasphony'.\nThis film cannot be watched once and dismissed. It deserves to be watched over and over again. It is a timeless movie where something seems new every time you watch it. I applaud you `Carnival of Souls'. One of the greatest movies ever made.";Find yourself Miss Holligoss.........

The river may have been in Lawrence, Kansas, but the other scenes are in SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH and at the SALTAIR RESORT on the Great Salt Lake.  The scenes at the 'carnival pavillion' are of the SALTAIR ballroom and amusement park.  My parents met at a dance there in 1934 when the lake was still high but a small train ride was needed to reach the shore for bathing. Originally you just walked down the stairs to the water.  Later the pavillion, still on the original pilings (shown in the next to last scene) was just used as an amusement park.  I rode their huge roller coaster in 1956. The lake continued to receed, the roller coaster was blown down  twice by high winds and eventually the place was closed.  At the time this film was made, my high school friends and I used to sneak in and explore the condemned site. The 'prarie' referred to by one reviewer is in fact the Salt Flats and old beach area.  I saw this film when one of several efforts to raise money for restoring SALTAIR was in progress.  Arsonists burned the place down eventually. It was a stunninly beautiful place with one of the most beautiful ballrooms of the Victorian Era. We felt it as a huge loss of a city landmark.\nOther scenes are in downtown SLC: the church where the heroine plays is an Episcopal church where my best friend got married, the water fountain scene is on the grounds of the City and County Building, NOTE the VERY WIDE STREETS! Salt Lake is known for them.  Many of the buildings shown still stand like ZCMI dept. store where the dress scene is taken (you can make out the letters set into the pavement as she exits the store) and Ron Wilson (the tire place with the mechanic) had a Chevrolet Dealership too,  the Union Station (train scene) stands but I'm not certain about the Grayhound Depot (the spot where I departed from SLC 30 years ago (though I return for several visits a year.)\nI loved ""Carnival"" when I first saw it and I love it now for both the sites and the story. Which, by the way, recalls Ambrose Bierce's ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge"", the French film of which was first aired in the US on The Twilight Zone around the time this film was made.";SALTAIR & SALT LAKE CITY are not in KANSAS anymore

The man was definitely right on that score.  Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such.

50;51.0;4.0;7.0;5324;"What is it about this film, that makes me want to watch it again and again?  It can't be the special effects; they are laughable.  It can't be the sound; the dubbing is the worst I've ever seen.  It can't be stellar performances by all involved; some of the acting and dialogue are horribly corny.\nI think what makes this movie special, what has earned it a cult following, is that it traps the viewer within its own world, a claustrophobic, washed-out black and white world, a world on the edge of twilight heading inexorably toward an eternal darkness, a world where the heroine is slowly led to her doom, in spite of her desperate attempts to escape.  Lots of horror movies try to create this feeling of ""no exit"" but most try to do it with silly fright gimmicks and fail miserably.  This one uses a slowly constricting, strangely palid atmosphere centered on one character's increasingly odd experiences, eerie organ music, excellent cinematography, and an expressionistic landscape (a spider web shuddering on tree branches; a dark, abandoned carnival pavilion seen off on the horizon, a car pulled from a muddy river) to create a surrealistic sense of horror.  Candace Hilligoss, who only made this and one other horror film, turns in a stunning performance reminiscent of Kim Novak in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo: distant, vulnerable, refined, yet repressed.  It's exactly what was needed here, and it makes her one of the most memorable horror actresses ever, in my book.";Creepy!
51;58.0;5.0;6.0;5343;_Carnival of Souls_ may not be a true film classic (even its director, Herk Harvey, didn't count it among his best work), but it's one of a precious few American films from the early '60s that qualify as serious works of art.\n\nExtras abound on this 2-disc edition, but the most interesting of the lot pertain to the Centron Corporation, an ultra-low-budget production company in Lawrence, Kansas.  Most of the  crew for _Carnival of Souls_ (including Harvey himself) worked for Centron, which specialized in instructional films for public schools and corporations.  As a Centron employee Harvey would eventually direct nearly 400 short films, a few of which are featured here.\n\nThe DVD makes the persuasive argument that Harvey's ability to make the most out of extremely limited resources (as he did in _Carnival of Souls_) was a product of his many years as a director for Centron.  It also draws attention to the cinematic technique that goes into effective educational filmmaking, no matter how low the budget.\n\nThe 2-disc Criterion edition of _Carnival of Souls_ is a must-own for any cineaste who wants to examine the nuts and bolts of the filmmaker's craft.  (That said, less devoted cinephiles might prefer a rental.)  It revives and preserves, in the best manner possible, an artful low-budget horror film with a devoted cult following.  More importantly, it also brings attention to a long-neglected piece of American film history.  Kudos to Criterion for their excellent efforts.;One of Criterion's best packages

Horror movies like this are as rare as they are a true joy to every student of film or fan of the genre, made on shoestring budgets, with all the objective odds stacked against them, and yet coming through with all the vividness and vitality of a nightmare.  ""The man"" (Herk Harvey) following Mary around is terrifying, and it leaves just enough to the viewer's imagination to make every scene with him in it genuinely chilling.

What a shame; what a tragedy that this man did not receive the attention and praise he so richly deserved for this amazing and disturbing film. From the opening credits, one is keenly aware that this movie is a work of art, from the patterns Harvey discovered and lovingly framed in the moving water and sediments of a muddy riverbank, to the ingeniously placed titles as the film begins.

After managing to recover and start a new life in the city, the  survivor begins to find herself 'cut off' from the world, sometimes finds  nobody can see or hear her.  These are scenes anybody who has ever felt  alienated from society or lost in the world can easily identify with.  The  film is a wealth of unnerving images, such as the abandoned amusements park  and dance hall.\nAnother memorable aspect of the film is the dark-suited,  deathly-faced phantom who seems to lurk in every shadow.  Somehow I found  him a far more sinister and unnerving presence than Freddy or Jason.  It  must be the power of the imagination - the psychological threat of danger,  what might happen, is far more terrifying than simple acts of blood-letting  or violence.\nAll in all, this film is everything a horror film should be  - filled with haunting images, a sympathetic central character and a  clever, thought-provoking storyline.;One of the most hauntingly sinister horror films ever made.

Imagine not knowing you've died, walking around as  a ghost and being unable to understand why nobody can see or hear you.  An  all-time classic, this is living proof that imagination and style are more  important in films than money and special effects.  The scenery is  wonderfully sinister and the abandoned funfair provides a powerful image.  Also noteworthy is Harvey's dark-suited ghoul, who, with his menacingly  calm intent and glinting-eyed smile, dominates his every scene and is a far  more nightmarish figure than the likes of Freddy and Jason.

To today's viewer, this film is just plain  boring.

However, this film is able to sustain a creepy and  oppressive atmosphere throughout, and that is the major achievement. Even  though I knew when every ""scary"" moment was coming, and I guessed  the ending 20 minutes before the film actually ended, that knowledge didn't  ruin it for me. That's how strong the movie is, that you can enjoy the film  even if you knew everything about it. The acting is stiff and the dialogue  is often stilted, but that just adds to the strange and dark atmosphere of  the film. And the Criterion release is a real gem. Two discs, the first has  the theatrical release of the film, and the second has the director's cut.  The film looks incredible. I've yet to see such an old and cheaply made  movie look so good.

65;2.0;5.0;110.0;6157;"The merits of this film are obvious enough to simply summarize: it is the one and only original shoestring budget classic. No, the plot isn't original, but that hasn't stopped others from picking it up and running with it, sometimes in different directions, and sometimes even more  successfully (see ""Jacob's Ladder"" for a deeper, and darker,  take). But I doubt that ANYone ANYwhere has made a better film for less  money; as someone below wrote, """"Blair Witch"", eat your  heart out.""\nAnd then to have it released on a Criterion DVD, well,  it just doesn't get any better than that! OK, we may not need TWO versions,  .... And the second DVD isn't just a filler: you get  anything and everything you could think of associated with the movie,  including ""now and then"" visits to the film sites, a great  hour-long tribute, a history of the film company, stills, probably more  than all but the most compulsive fan would want but you won't feel as  though you've gotten short-changed! As always, the real reason we love  Criterion is the quality of their prints - they are simply THE BEST you are  going to see. Anyone who has seen this film on one of its numerous cheapie  incarnations on VHS will be ecstatic with this version - you won't believe  how superior the picture quality is.\nI have to say ""get this now,  before it's discontinued"". This edition can NOT be bettered; you will  NEVER EVER see a better version of this classic sleeper.\nNow, Criterion,  when are you going to release Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"",  hmmmm?";Once again, THANK YOU, Criterion!
66;46.0;5.0;8.0;6178;As the writer of the original film I must say how pleased I am with the expertese of the producer and technicians at the Criterion Collection who compiled and made this DVD version of the film.  I am especially delighted  to see my friend Herk Harvey's efforts so wonderfully preserved.  --John Clifford;Great craftsmanship by Criterion Collection
67;22.0;5.0;15.0;6214;"Almost as eerie and unexplainable for me as the film itself, is the fact that this film has made it to DVD and by Criterion no less. This movie is close to my heart because I know Larry Sneegas, who played the young hood  at the beginning who asks the girls ""Wanna drag ?"" (Larry was  also part of the production crew for this and many other  ""industrial"" films with director Herk Harvey). The historic  Englewood theater here in Kansas City showed CARNIVAL a few years ago as  part of a tribute to local film makers and what a treat to see it for the  first time on the big screen! Larry has been gracious enough to loan me his  VHS copy of THE MOVIE THAT WOULDN'T DIE documentary that Criterion has  included ... some great background on this small-but-mighty film and I  can't wait to see all the other ""extras"" on the disc as well.  I've seen both versions of the movie (again thanks to Larry) and while they  each work marvelously, who wouldn't prefer the director's ""more  zombies"" cut?  The reviews below really capture the film's essence,  so all I can say is ENJOY !";Unbelievable
68;69.0;5.0;5.0;6279;"This easily surpasses the amateurishly made  ""Blair Witch Project"". This even surpasses ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Hush. Hush... Sweet Charlotte"" or the original ""The  Haunting"". Without gore or Special Effects and shot on a budget of  about $ 30'000: If you want a movie that shocks the hell out of you, THIS  is it.";The most frightening film ever made
69;70.0;4.0;5.0;6356;A masterpiece of low budget cinema - allegedy an inspiration to David Lynch for Eraserhead and Romero for Night of the Living Dead. I'm not sure if that's true but it certainly has similarities. I totally enjoyed this  film, spooky, wierd and dreamy.;Lo-budget classic

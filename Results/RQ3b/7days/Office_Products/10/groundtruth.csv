0;1.0;1.0;23.0;0;It looks great but the handle wripped off after not much use. I would love to get a replacement because maybe it was defective, but it says it is past the return/exchange date. I hope the seller will contact me. It was my son's and he is very disappointed;handle broke after a few months of gentle use.
1;4.0;1.0;6.0;53;This Bible cover tore apart within a few / couple months. It looks nice. It does not feel nice. It is not nice quality. It was a waste of money for me.;Low Quality - Prone to Tears
2;8.0;5.0;10.0;514;Fits a MacArthur study Bible great.  It just has about an inch extra of vertical space...side to side is about perfect.  Interior pockets are nice and there is a bit of extra depth to use them.  It looks really nice and has kept my Bible from getting beat up with daily travel in a backpack.  Highly Recommend!;Fits a MacArthur study Bible great. It just has about an inch extra of ...
3;7.0;1.0;15.0;914;Misleading information.  This is not extra large as advertised.\nWe will keep it to hold a smaller bible.  This is the problem with buying online, you need to be able to trust what is said.;This is not Extra large
4;6.0;2.0;25.0;1152;"About 15 months ago I bought a MacArthur Study Bible and this cover to protect it.  I really liked the size and style and the ""bomber jacket"" look.  It was more than roomy enough for the Bible and all the stuff that collects in an all occasion Bible.\n\nAfter using it a few times weekly for about six months one end of the handle tore lose.  The stitching at the base of the handle loop acted like the dotted line on tear off paper products. The particular line of stitching is decorative and is unnecessary for the function of the cover.  I glued it back together and it lasted several more months and the other end let go which caused the repair to also fail leaving me holding the handle and the Bible, well protected mind you, laying on the ground.\n\nIt looks great, is roomy, protects a Bible well, but it has that one serious design flaw.  If you buy it, don't hold it by the handle, it is sure to eventually fail.";It Was Good While it Lasted

6;3.0;4.0;50.0;1251;I ordered two of these Bible covers for my MacArthur Large Print Study Bible and Matthew Henry's Commentary. The books measure 9  x 6  x 2 -inches. The label on the package indicates that the cover will accommodate a book 6 7/8 x 9 5/8-inches. First I thought the covers were too small, however after inserting the book into the cover it just fit. The cover's not leather but the quality is very good.;Size of the cover.
7;2.0;4.0;148.0;1475;The quality of this Bible cover is very good. The look is also just as advertised. Overall, it is an outstanding product. However, the dimensions listed (12.3 x 9.1 x 2 inches), while they may be the dimensions of the Bible cover itself (I didn't actually measure it), do not indicate, or even come close to, the dimensions of the Bible it will hold. I have an ESV Larger Print Study Bible and it is HUGE (11.25 x 8 x 2.625). This Bible cover will only hold a Bible up to 9.625 X 6.875. Fortunately, I have another Bible, of a more typical size, for which this cover will work just fine.;Very nice, but...
8;10.0;4.0;11.0;1656;"Bible cover looks of good quality materials and stitching. Very nice looking and can easily be for man or woman. Good zipper as well. Book will lay flat when open. Would be a great gift item too. Front of cover has a very nice looking 1"" small/subtle cross embossed in the lower right hand corner.\n\nMy bible dimensions are hardcover Bible 9.5 x 6.5 x 1.4 inches. My cover has an extra 1/2"" inch left around the front, top and bottom after I inserted my book. It was the perfect fit for this size of book.\n\nI feel the cover will last several years. One thing - I do wish the handle was made of thicker leather. (That alone would of added several more years to its use.\n\nI will be using this cover daily for my Bible to and from work/church - so, in several months, I will add additional information on here to let you know how it is holding up. Hope this review has helped.";Good product
9;5.0;5.0;33.0;1715;I was looking for a bible cover for my NIV Archaeological Study Bible and came across this one which happened to be 50% at The Family Christian Store!  From first glance I liked the Leather look and after closer inspection had a feeling that this cover would be a good fit with my bible and I was correct!  Not only was it a good fit but is very well stitched!  I found the zipper on this cover to be very smooth unlike covers I have had in the past and am very pleased with my choice.  I should have picked up a couple of more while I was at the store but they went quickly!  Highly recommended!  Very stylish looking and protects your bible very well!;High Quality Stylish Bible Cover!

0;1.0;5.0;23.0;0;This is one of the best waffle makers I have found. It has removable trays for easy cleaning. The shell has barely anything in it for easy cleaning. The light on the front lets you know when it is heating up and when it is at temperature. The knob has a fluid motion instead of preset settings. It does have settings listed on it. One set of setting for when it is used as a griddle, and one set for when it is used as a waffle iron. When used as a griddle, it can be used open for eggs, bacon, pancakes, and other items. It can also be used as a closed griddle for sandwiches, hamburgers, and others.\n\nI have used it to cook waffles, sandwiches, and hamburgers. All have been cooked evenly and fully. The hamburgers were done in about 6-7 minutes and sandwiches in about 3-4 minutes. This cuts down on time since each side would have to be cooked in a skillet or open griddle. With this, both sides are cooked at the same heat, for the same amount of time. When using it with greasy items, such as hamburgers, it has a drip trough for the grease to run to and run out of the drip spout. Not cooking it in its own grease helps to lower the grease content.;Best Griddle/Grill/Waffle Iron
1;18.0;5.0;6.0;37;Love it.  I've been looking for a waffle iron that doesn't make Belgian Waffles - they never get crispy. These type waffle irons are hard to find.  This makes perfect waffles.  There is low, med, high and then a specific setting for waffles.  You can turn the grids around and make paninnis, grilled cheese or even hamburgers.  If you like Classic waffles more than Belgian, this waffle maker is for you.  Nice teflon keeps the waffle from sticking.;Love It!
2;14.0;5.0;11.0;84;"This IS the ONE!  We purchased this exact same Black and Decker Waffle Iron over 20 YEARS AGO!  It still works fine making thin crispy light waffles (the ones with the small holes that each hold one chocolate chip).  I see the photos from other users and they just didn't read the directions on how to use it.  Waffle irons all have to be ""Seasoned"" even if they have a non stick coating like this one does.  When properly seasoned, nothing will stick to this waffle iron.  We also don't recommend using it as a griddle to cook bacon and eggs because the high heat will ruin the seasoning on the waffle side of the plates and you will have to ""Season"" it all over again.  We just unpacked our new one and it is exactly like the original (We are so happy).  Be careful to snap the plates in tightly and they will NOT fall out.  They CAN be removed for cleaning if you need to, but I highly recommend against it. Use your fry pan for bacon and eggs and save your little Black and Decker Waffle iron for making perfect waffles every time.";Black and Decker Waffle Iron and Grill
3;20.0;1.0;9.0;86;Just like other customers have expressed, the plates are not hold in place. Base seems made cheap: it's flimsy and distorted. The heating unit was placed too hi, so can't close the unit: burnt myself already. Heat is uneven. Amazon is sending replacement but I think they should pull the item off an not sell. Too dangerous.;DANGEROUS!
4;13.0;3.0;13.0;99;"I bought this a while back and got a good dozen or so uses out of it. Everything works fine about the machine; it cooks waffles well, and I also like that you can remove the plates and wash them, as well as use this as a griddle or sandwich press. For the price, it does the job.\n\nThe main thing which caused me to break down and buy a more expensive waffle maker was that the top plate does not stay securely in place like the lower plate. You have to be very careful how you open the griddle, because if there is any type of sticking, the top plate may fall out and cause a mess or possibly injury/burns. I've had this happen multiple times.\n\nAgain, it does what it is supposed to, and the waffles were always cooked well (look for the steam to stop coming out of the sides, not the light), but I just got sick of having to guess whether or not the top plate was going to fall on my hand. I'd recommend dropping some more cash on something like the Cuisinart Belgian Waffle Maker with Pancake Plates.";Decent product, beware of the top plate falling out during cooking.
5;19.0;4.0;10.0;103;Hi\n\nHad a little trouble at first, I had the grills for the waffle maker placed in the wrong slots so they weren't  releasing probably. I later found out that it was the recipe that I use to make this non-dairy Healthy waffles that make it stick.  Rising of a normal waffle mix helps for easy release. Even with that recipe for healthy waffles being a little stressful, this works like a complete dream. I loved it so much I made a month supply of waffles haha.\n This waffle maker is a major improvement from what I first started with. This waffle maker makes it enjoyable to make waffles now. When you get it in your home you're going to notice that it is really thin, and it's going to feel cheaply made because of that, but it is not. tt will tell you do not touch the top of the waffle maker when in use and you do not do that. the coil is right there. They could have supplied it with a thicker housing to compensate for the heat it gives off.  The grills are really easy to clean. you're going to want to pay attention to the placement of the grills because I have noticed that it matters, if not they are going to fall out of the slots.;Enjoy your waffle maker I Love it
6;31.0;1.0;5.0;104;Hate this waffle maker! This Black and Decker 3-1 Waffle maker looks like the wonderfully efficient Toastmaster 3-1 Griddle I owned years ago. The plates on this griddle do not stay locked in place and dangerously keep falling out when attempting to close, not good when they're hot!  I tried pressing the mechanism tighter to no avail. The waffles don't even taste good because the griddles down compress enough, and the waffles aren't crispy. I'm stuck with this poor quality, inefficient waffle iron, do not recommend this brand or refurbished appliances from seller. (I own a small Cuisinart waffle iron and a Krups which are excellent, but always liked a 3-1). Black + Decker misses the mark, the refurbished appliance is a waste of money.;Too bad for me I waited too long to use Black + Decker 3-1 Waffle Maker
7;8.0;5.0;36.0;268;So I've had this for over a year and it's well loved and well used. I tend to use the waffle side more than the griddle plates because it's what I bought it for.\n\nCooks evenly, no hot spots (which is surprising) obviously protect your hands and don't touch anything metal while this is on or has been recently on. It's the old fashioned kind, it's not encased in plastic, it's metal. Don't forget this or you're gonna burn yourself and blame the machine which is unfair to the machine.\n\nI've used the griddle open faced I've pressed sandwiched in it like a panini press but my favorite and predominant use is the waffle iron.\n\nI'm a kitchen gizmo person. I know I can do most things without them but why when there's a gizmo and gadget for it?  More specifically though I bought this because I wanted something other than Belgian waffles and I remembered that my grandmother had a waffle iron that looked dead on this though I cannot remember if her plates were removable.\n\nAny who, my grandmother passed away a few years back and I polled my sisters trying to see if anyone remembered the brand, no one was positive but my oldest sister told me she thought it was a black and decker so I took to the Amazon.\n\nFound this beauty and immediately bought it. Second it got delivered I had it out cleaned and ready to go ( those delivery notifications are awesome. Once I knew it was out for delivery I timed it with my normal carrier's route and had the batter ingredients out and ready to roll)\n\nI would caution you to be careful about the grease you use and to have something to collect it should it get too warm and slide off the plates.\n\nI use bacon grease coz that's how I was taught and it's wonderful but obviously thin and will leak out the corner if you use the correct amount to grease the iron.\n\nI've just put it on a part of the counter I can clean super easy between batches and be done with it.\n\nBoth of my sisters covet this bad boy but they're on their own. I live a few thousand miles away now so they just have to get their own.  Last weekend they asked about it and it's what got me thinking its time to review this bad boy. Actually if I remember correctly I paid a bit more for it that what its pricing for now but honestly I'd do it all over again and for more.\n\nGood wafflemakers especially not Belgian waffle makers are hard to come by.\n\nDon't get me wrong I ALSO have a Belgian wafflemaker but this, this is what trotted out on my counter every couple of weekends.;Just like my grandmother's
8;16.0;2.0;19.0;297;I only wish i had used it earlier so that i could return it before the return period ran out. After one use of the griddle, the non-stick coating pealed off at spots where there was grease. This happened while washing the griddle plates.;I only wish i had used it earlier so that ...
9;47.0;4.0;5.0;375;I really like this waffle maker. We have three in the office. We bought a forth because there was no overfill catch on one. Two were single/mini waffles. I looked through all the amazon reviews on popular / highly rated waffle makers via 3rd party sites. I was struck with hesitation after seeing most amazon reviews for these items the last couple of months are all one star.\n\nWe just bought a second one of these. It makes great waffles. The removable inserts are secure. We didn't have any problems with the latch because we carefully put them on and take them off. We pull the metal latch back a bit and then release it. We had no problem with heat. We rubbed oil on initially with a paper towel.  One more thing that was great is the waffle maker is hot, but it has several handles that are not. Out of our previous three, only one had a handle that didn't get extremely hot after 3 or more batches.\n\nI hope this is helpful for anyone like me, that was confused by all the one star reviews. I gave it four out of five, for price, easy of use, great waffles, but it is on the slow side. We make 10-20 batches so we just bought a second one to speed things up.;I really like this waffle maker
10;5.0;5.0;112.0;505;Cooks well and cleanly.  However, be mindful that you need to allow just a little bit of time between taking out the fresh cooked waffle and putting in new batter to cook.  If you start the process too quickly, you can get an undone center and the outsides will be done as intended.  Also I found that when it cools down I can wrap the cord around the bottom half and put the cord in that small groove and lock it in with the plug in on the other side.  I use a large pan under it to catch any overage-spill from baking.  I have put too much batter in and had it ooze out the sides and drip onto that pan.  It breaks right off from the waffle iron when done, and I can easily clean up the drip on the pan underneath.  Use aluminum foil and merely dispose of the foil when done.  I used NO spray, but relied on the oil I have in my waffle recipe (home style recipe).  I wish there were a cross-element of coiled heating wire to get the centers of the grill more even, rather than the solid heating element.  However, this type of element will be a lot harder to damage or burn out later on.;Cooks OLD style regular waffels to perfection!
11;23.0;1.0;21.0;644;No matter how much cooking spray I get on the iron, it pulls every single waffle apart and leaves at least 1/2 of it stuck to the iron, most of the time the entire waffle.;Rips waffles apart
12;50.0;2.0;6.0;729;After owning this waffle maker for over 1 year I've finally had enough and am throwing it out. It's big, it's bulky, it's heavy and takes forever to heat up. If using as waffle maker, it takes 7-8 minutes to heat up, if using as griddle, try infinity. That part you can plan ahead for as long as you know it. I suppose you can make your batter while this piece of junk pre-heats.\n\nI've burned myself and had to scrape bits of waffles off this thing more often than I can count. And yes, I did read and follow all of the instructions. I am German after all. The metal outside coating has no insulation whatsoever, so it gets crazy hot, really bad idea if you have kids. I've even burned my fingers on the black parts where you lift the top, on the medium waffle setting.\n\nDifferent waffle recipes are hit or miss. I always make sure I use adequate oil in my batter, but I've found that some recipes stick. You end up with almost burnt outside waffles that are stuck to the plates, while the inside isn't cooked. On the medium setting, mind you, using recipes from magazines that have clearly been tested.\n\nHaving removable plates comes in handy when you have that kind off mess on your hands. Ever scraped bits of half burnt half cooked waffles off one of these with a wooden chopstick? Not fun. Unfortunately, the removable plates have a tendency to come off the top part even when they're clipped in properly, just because they are freakin' heavy and the clip is weak. Then you end up trying to lift that heavy ass plate off your waffle trying not to burn yourself.\n\nThis thing is just poorly thought out and not safe to use. I will buy a German brand next time.;Get ready to burn your fingers and curse this thing out.
13;43.0;1.0;8.0;729;I've always been a B&D fan. This however was a complete disappointment. The construction is way too flimsy for what it's supposed to do. The interchangeable panels are a great concept, but the locking tabs are weak and don't hold them securely, so they fall out easily. Not good when you realize that behind them are unshielded heating elements. The hinges that allow the top to adjust for sandwiches are stamped metal and very lightweight rivets...very flimsy. Sadly, this unit shows what happens when a great company allows accountants to dictate design instead of letting the engineers do the job right. Properly constructed, this would be a first class addition to any kitchen. It's not. Thanks to Amazon for a first class return and credit policy, this one is going back tomorrow morning.;Black and Decker dropped the ball badly on this
14;37.0;1.0;10.0;735;We bought a similar waffle maker for less than $20 30 or so years ago.  It performed admirably as a regular member of our family weekend breakfast until it died an untimely death months ago.  Having lived with this.... thing for a while now, I can categorically say that this waffle maker is a backward step in applicance manufacture and design.  Parts are more flimsy, it cooks unevenly, etc....  I know that this will have to be replaced in a year or two.  Only keeping it because my family prefers the standard waffle to the belgian waffle and I CAN'T FIND A REPLACEMENT.  What does it say when I pay more than twice the amount for something that performs less than half as well?;Devolution in action
15;49.0;1.0;7.0;821;"I was so excited to find this item that I loved making grilled cheese sandwiches and waffles on when I was a kid. I have a small kitchen now so having one gadget that performs multiple functions was also a plus.  My excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I received it and noticed how lightweight an cheaply made it seemed to be.  Understanding that materials have changed in the past 35 years and heavier doesn't always mean better, I decided to keep it and give it a try.  Unfortunately, one of the hinges was not assembled properly and the top would not stay upright. I contacted Amazon and requested a replacement which was very easy and hassle free.  When the replacement arrived I checked the hinges which seemed fine.  The grill plates were loose and didn't fit perfectly but what the heck, my mouth was watering for the grilled cheese sandwich from my childhood.  It worked good enough and I decided to keep it.  Well since then I have made two more grilled cheese sandwiches and had two mornings of waffles and looks like that is all I get.  The top plate of the grill will not stay attached to the cover; it does however stay attached to the waffles when the top is lifted.  It seems to be an issue with the clip that is supposed to keep it in place. I tried adjusting the clip a bit to no avail.  It is past the return deadline so $60 bucks down the drain; I guess at least I still have my childhood memories.  I strongly suggest you do not buy this product.";... was so excited to find this item that I loved making grilled cheese sandwiches and waffles on when I ...
16;39.0;5.0;10.0;944;We've used our new waffle maker a few times now and it's great.  Before choosing it I did read all the reviews and took them into consideration, but bottom line, this was exactly what I wanted, had one just like it years ago.  We oiled the waffle plates before using it the first time and have never had a problem with sticking, the waffles come out perfect.  They are not thick waffles, like the Belgium ones, these are just old fashioned waffles.  Much easier to make breakfast since this makes a larger 4-square then the Belgium waffle makers.  The only thing I can see that many reviewers pointed out, is that the two clips that hold the front of the griddles in place are not the best.  Looking at the picture on the box I could clearly see that these clips just weren't finished, they weren't bent the way they should be so I took care of that with a pair of needle nose pliers.  Now they are tight like they should be.  So the quality of things these days is not the best, my old one most likely was made in the USA, must sturdier.  But all in all this works well and hopefully will last for a few years.  There aren't very many that have the removable plates which make it easy to wash!;... new waffle maker a few times now and it's great. Before choosing it I did read all the ...
17;35.0;4.0;15.0;1468;03/03/13 - We've been using the new waffle maker for two months now and we've finally got the waffles to come out more evenly browned.  Perhaps it just took a while to find the correct setting and get it broke in.  I now would recommend this square waffle maker.  Although it still costs too much!\n\nWe bought this waffle maker on December 27, 2012, online from Amazon.com.  I compared many waffle makers online and in store.  Although the online ad said this waffle maker could be bought at Lowes and somewhere else for only $56.99, I called and they didn't have it and could not even order it.  This one cost me $129.99 - that's twice as much!  I'm still using the one we got when we were married in 1971.  It's orange, (yes, I said orange!) large, square, and has the griddle as well.  I want to be able to turn out more than just enough waffles for two people to set down and eat at the same time.  I did not want Belgian style and I did not want a round or smaller waffle maker.  This Black & Decker model was one of probably only two I found that are square.  The description read Square Extra-Large Waffle Maker.  Well, yes, it is larger than any other waffle makers I found.  But, it's still not as large as the one we got in 1971.  And, it doesn't brown the waffles evenly, where as my old one does.  I now hook them both up and use them at the same time so we can get eight (8 squares) to start eating while the next batch is cooking.\n\nI tried using the recipe in the pamphlet that came with it but we reverted back to using our old standby made with Bisquick.  We like the flavor better and we love to add some sugar and vanilla to the batter for even better flavor.  Note:  Pour approximately 3/4 cup of batter in the center of the grill.  A full cup is too much and will overflow.  I use a full cup on in our old waffle maker.\n\nFor those of you who have had difficulty with your waffles sticking to the grill, this is what works great for us:  BEFORE you plug in the grill and heat it, use a pastry brush and lightly brush both the top and bottom grills with liquid cooking oil.  Close the lid and heat.  Your waffles may cling to the top of the grill when you open it but will pop off really easy.  You DO NOT need to oil the grills again before pouring the next batch.  Do not overcook your waffles, unless you actually like them that way.  You can always close the lid and continue to cook them longer if they aren't done to your liking.\n\nALSO, these grills DO NOT need to be scrubbed before you put them away.  It's like seasoning a good skillet.  Just clean it up with a couple paper towels to absorb any oil left on the grills then wipe it down with a warm damp dish cloth.  Try this, it really works!  If you scrub it, your waffles will stick the next time even if you oil the grills.\n\nI hope this review helps anyone else that is as picky as we are when it come to finding a waffle maker.  I know this review is a bit long, but I really wish I had found a review with all this information in it when we was searching for one.  It would have made our decision easier.\n\nWe love our waffles!  LOL;I'm upgrading my review today - 03/03/13
18;53.0;5.0;8.0;1570;"All my life my parents had a square metal waffle iron. It had reversible plates that turned into a griddle and could be submerged into water for easy cleaning. The pattern on the waffle side was small and made little crisp wells for syrup; not fat wells like a Belgian waffle that get soggy. (I like lots of butter and syrup and need a waffle that holds up) Then I went to college. I searched for 4 years to find a waffle maker like theirs and FINALLY did. I've read some other reviews and thought I give my opinions and responses to others.\n\n--PROPER USE FOR GREAT WAFFLES:\n1)  I understand that it has non-stick plates, but it is essential to use cooking spray with this iron. I've seen several bad reviews because the cook didn't use cooking spray. I always use spray and have great results.\n2)There is a customer picture of a waffle from an iron that didn't heat evenly. TO address this: The iron has a waffle setting. I use the hotter end of that setting. That being said, you MUST wait around 5 minutes for these heavy duty plates to properly heat. Then get a little water on your finger and sprinkle a few drops on the plates. They should sizzle and bubble rapidly. You are ready to cook!\n3) Another photo showed the waffle stuck to the top of the iron. Once again use cooking spray! Also, do NOT try to lift the lid until the maker has stopped steaming! This will keep the waffle from pulling apart. Also, adding an egg to the waffle batter helps it cook!\n\n--PROPER CARE FOR A LONG LASTING WAFFLE MAKER:\n1)When finished making waffles wait until the plates have cooled to clean them. Use very hot soapy water and submerge the plates. Wash with a NON abrasive wash cloth and rinse with hot water. Then take a towel and thoroughly dry both sides of the plates including between every groove. Wipe the cooled waffle iron down and replace the plates.\n2) Don't use metal on the plates. Please! I use a fork and pick the waffle up from the side. I NEVER let the fork touch the plates.\n3) On the front of the maker are small metal clips that hold the plates in place. Be gentle and don't abuse these!\n\nI LOVE my waffle iron. My parents still have their older model from circa 1970 and I hope to have mine as long. I have never had any problems out of mine. Please use with caution as all parts of this iron a very hot and remain so for a considerable amount of time after use.\n\nHope you enjoy yours as much as I do!";Just like the old models! LOVE LOVE LOVE
19;9.0;1.0;92.0;1851;"I wanted to love this waffle iron/griddle combo....but it hasn't worked out between us.  While I love that it's big enough to make multiple pancakes or huge waffles (theoretically), or grilled cheese sandwiches at once, I have had several issues.\n\nFirst of all....to me, ""nonstick"" means food should not stick.  Food DOES stick.  Feel free to view my photo (appropriately captioned ""we have had issues"") of a very stuck waffle.  Mamma wasn't happy that night.\n\nSecond, the griddle gets so hot that the shortening we use bakes onto it permanently, making the surface tacky and gross.  Even multiple trips through the dishwasher have failed to remove this residue.\n\nThird, this thing gets scary hot.  I am afraid of it.\n\nThis must have worked well for some people, based on the good reviews I read before purchasing, but I want my old waffle iron back....the one where I could actually get my waffles out to be able to eat them.";We have had issues
20;46.0;5.0;12.0;1929;"We have owned this B&D model for about 8 years and get great waffles every time. We're buying two more for our sons. Some revIews complain of recent quality problems, I guess we'll see. Here are two waffle cooking tips I use, learned from a 1939 GE model with no temp knob or anything. I plugged it in for 4 minutes and started cooking. 1.) Heat your waffle iron to the hottest waffle setting. When it's preheated pour in your batter and start a timer for 4 minutes, don't use the light on the machine. You can wait for the steaming to stop but that's ""iffy."" The first waffle will be a bit more done than the rest, which will be light golden. If you like them crisper, add 30 seconds or a minute to your timer. Time every waffle and ignore the light. Also-and most importantly-Never Wash Your Grill Plates!! Follow instructions for treating prior to first use. Then make waffles , clean exterior and put away until next time. You never have to clean the waffle side of the plates. Have butter in your recipe? Me too, doesn't matter. Washing the thing means it never stops sticking. The 1939 model wasn't washed for decades. (""OMG, you never washed it??"") They told you not to wash it! If you use the flat grill side and need to clean that one side, you may use a little soap and a sponge and/or paper towels. Use a wet one to rinse it. Take it from a good cook, we've become overly fanatic about washing things, and the waffle side will work for you unwashed. The coating and metal clips will last better too. Happy cooking!";Know your waffle-baking techniques
21;44.0;1.0;13.0;2115;I have been extremely frustrated with this waffle maker, and I have finally decided to get rid of it after several failed attempts. I cannot get the waffles to not stick. At first I was using Pam. Then I tried greasing both sides with oil with a pastry brush, per another reviewer, and still no luck. The waffle rips apart every time, and then I'm stuck with a big mess. Not how I want to spend a Saturday morning.;What am I doing wrong?
22;25.0;2.0;30.0;2177;We've had the G48TD for over six months, using it weekly.  We have never had a waffle come out with even browning.  See our uploaded photo of a typical waffle.  We chose the B&D because it was mid-priced and had some good reviews.  Bad mistake.  I contacted B&D, thinking perhaps we got a lemon.  They said they had few complaints and we were out of warranty.  No help at all.  My advice--don't buy unless  you want to gamble.  If you buy and aren't happy, return it right away. Don't experiment with different settings, different recipes, etc.  Just get rid of it.;Uneven heating, bad customer service
23;6.0;5.0;166.0;2230;I have uploaded a picture of our 8 1/2 year old Black & Decker G48TD that was purchased in the summer of 2002, side-by-side with the new replacement I just bought this week.  The old one was still working, but the no-stick finish was finally worn through, and what looked like rust was showing.\n\nI am very happy with how long this appliance lasted.  We use ours every Saturday morning for either pancakes, waffles, or french toast.  That means we used ours more than 400 times.\n\nThe new one looks exactly the same...at least I don't notice any design changes.\n\nI like the fact that the G48TD is a waffle maker and griddle in one.  It cuts down on the number of small appliances I need.\n\nThe no stick finish is actually more like a stick resistant finish.  After about 6 months you'll end up needing cooking spray to keep things from sticking.  But it works great, and lasts a long time.\n\nIn short, I have no trouble recommending this product!;A Great Value that Lasts and Lasts....
24;75.0;3.0;5.0;2295;I purchased this product because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen.  I only wanted it for making waffles, not for the griddle portion.  I had a mickey mouse waffle maker that I've used for 17 years that I passed on to my daughter...it made perfect waffles.  What I liked about the black and decker waffle maker is that it makes 4 square waffles, about the size of a small piece of bread.  This is perfect for the toaster if I want to freeze them for later.  What I was disappointed in was that the back portion (near the hinge in the machine) gets considerably less toasted than the rest.  The heating element is round, so it doesn't extend near the corners anyway, and I am told that heating elements generally aren't as hot near where they come out from the hinge.  How hard would it be to make the heating element laid out in a way that would cover more of the unit (maybe in a couple of coils, like a burner on a stove, but more squared)???;A little disappointed
25;76.0;2.0;5.0;2296;For years I struggled with a low end plastic waffle iron. Wanting an *upgrade*, one of my cooking magazines recommended black and decker's as being a good quality. On that, I ordered this item. I have to say initially it was a good unit, although somewhat flimsy. I liked that you could flip the griddle plates for waffles or pancakes. It gets very hot, and made nice, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside waffles the first time out. I was so happy at first. But now after nearly a year of occasional use the iron sticks so bad, nothing can be pried from its surface. The so called no-stick coating is worthless. Pancakes must be scraped from the griddle and waffles- just forget it, they have become one with the the iron until submerged in hot water for a few hours. I give up on this iron, now I'm looking for another better one. And don't think I did some crazy thing to damage the surface either. Nope, just washed it with dish soap and hot water after each use. Can't for the life of me figure out why its sticks so badly now. Such a shame too.;Not what I had hoped for.
26;54.0;1.0;10.0;2475;I hate to sound too nasty but this thing was just horrible!  I just sent it back.  It was bought to replace a Sunbeam we got for a wedding present in 1962 - that is about 50 years ago.  The Sunbeam has worked great all those years and is still working but deterioation of insulating material and corrosion of the heating element caused me to scrap it for safety reasons.  We expected the B&D to at least come close to the old unit but it did not.  No matter how we preheated the new one when half the waffle was well cooked the other half was just beginning to cook and was too raw to be put on your plate.  Huge disappointment B&D - I have used your tools for years and now I am beginning to think that perhaps the quality of all your products may have shrunk to dime-store quality.;A real piece of junk
27;45.0;5.0;14.0;2558;Since the Eggo's I love so much are in such short supply (I like the whole grain ones), I decided to make and freeze my own waffles.  The belgian waffle maker made the waffles too thick.  I was used to a thinner version as with the Eggo type.  I bought this waffle iron and it fits the bill perfectly.  Waffles come out perfect every time and I can freeze them or keep them in a zip lock bag and pop them in the toaster - AND I can make them with oat bran, whole wheat flour, flax seed, or anything I want and they come out crisp and delicious everytime.\n\nAn added bonus to this item is that you can also use it as a grill to make pancakes or grilled cheese or anything you want to grill by turning over the removable plates which can be then put in the diswasher.\n\nI love this product.\n\nThanks Black and Decker from a Black and Gold Saints winner in New Orleans, La. (and ya'll we really know good food here)\n\nSusan H. Barre;Best waffle maker ever!!!
28;66.0;5.0;7.0;2591;"I absolitely love this wafflemaker.  It makes the best waffles, not big thick belgian ones, but smaller square ones. It also makes the best evenly browned grilled cheese sandwiches.  I've also grilled hot dogs on it and I've had a friend remark "" It's like being in Yankee Stadium.""  It is so easy to clean because the plates (reversible for waffles/grilling) snap out and can be submersed in water,unlike other wafflemakers that do not have removable plates. I do not normally fill out these reviews, but I love it so much I came back to order another for my niece and just had to tell everyone.  Buy it!  You will love it!";Love it!
29;78.0;5.0;5.0;2660;"After our nearly 13 year old waffle baker finally gave out I hunted high and low for a regular ""old fashioned"" waffle baker.  We settled on a Belgian waffle baker but despite the fact that we couldn't ever get them crispy enough for our taste, it only made one at a time and for our family of five, it just wasn't enough.  Not to mention we enjoy doubling or even tripling the batches to toast up later in the week (it's a pain to store or toast Belgian waffles).  So we gave a couple store-bought waffle bakers a try and they were awful, completely unable to make a decent waffle.\nTHIS machine had been in my Amazon shopping cart for over a year and I wish I hadn't waited so long to buy it!  Totally worth the $50ish dollars that we paid for it!  The waffles come out crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and with so little effort.\nClean up is a SNAP with the griddles being removable (it's recommended not to put in the dishwasher, but with bowls to wash from the batter, we {by we, I mean my husband!} just wash them up at the same time).  Since it's arrival just a few weeks ago we've made several batches and it's been great!  This one looks like it'll last for many years to come!";Exactly What We Wanted
30;79.0;2.0;5.0;2677;"After reading all the reviews, I purchased this waffle maker to replace our broken Cuisinart Round which we were very happy with.  I was enticed by the larger size and multi-purpose.  Upon using, I was very unhappy with the product.  The waffles take forever too cook, are hard to pour and get out due to the square size, and worst - come out flat as a pancake.  I'm not looking for a belgium style but I'd more than an Eggo.\n\nWorse yet, when I went to return it, I realized it was sold through a ""amazon partner"" OK-Sales.  They don't post the return policy and guess what - no returns!  Lovely - I bought this based on the fact that I could return it if I don't like it and OK-Sales refused to return unless it was broken.  Sigh...";Not that happy...
31;34.0;4.0;24.0;2873;"When I first got this waffle baker, I really was disappointed.  I washed the plates with soapy water and then oiled them up as described in the instructions - but my waffles were sticking worse than I've ever seen before.  Basically, the first (and sometimes the second) waffle of every batch was tearing in half and I had to scrape the pieces off of the top and bottom plates using a wooden spoon.  Nothing usable was left after this process and it was a huge, messy pain.  Because of the big mess, I would rewash the plates in soapy water after each use and then I tried to keep the waffles from sticking by using heavy coats of cooking spray; which left subsequent waffles soggy and oily, but still didn't prevent the first ones from tearing in half.\n\nAfter a few weeks of that, I got online to see what I could do to help resolve this problem - or if I should just throw this new waffle baker away.  (My old ones never had these problems, so I thought it was just a problem with the model.)\n\nFortunately, I was able to come up with a few steps that completely eliminated my issues; so, here they are:\n1) Never wash those plates with soap (after the initial cleaning of course), since it takes the oil coating off - it's fine to soak them in water or to wipe them off; just don't use soapy water or you'll have to re-season them.\n2) Before pouring the first waffle, I heat the baker up to the maximum temperature and then turn it down to my desired waffle heat once the first waffle is poured.  This isn't important once the plates are fully seasoned, but it helps with the first few batches.\n3) Be sure to put enough oil in the waffle recipe.  In my case, the recipe calls for 2 tbsp but I've found that 1/4 tbsp extra makes a huge difference and probably just offsets the oil that didn't pour out of the measuring spoon anyway.\n4) In my case, I don't pull the waffle out the instant the light goes out.  I wait about 30 seconds until the steam starts to lighten up - this also prevents you from needing a hotpad when opening the baker.  (Something you'll learn fast with this particular model is that the steam coming out the front can be very hot:).)\n5) I don't use cooking spray at all anymore (which is more than I can say for my old waffle irons).  It isn't needed at all for the waffles to come out perfectly.\n\nWith these easy tweaks, I'm now able to get perfect waffle off of this every time - from the first waffle to the last.  They taste great and the extras go into the freezer so the kids can warm them up in the toaster on weekends.\n\nI honestly will probably never use the grill plates since I have another electric griddle that is larger - but the waffle baker works really well.  I would highly recommend it.";Great waffle baker (once I figured out how to use it)
32;56.0;5.0;10.0;2894;I have searched for a long time for a good waffle maker: one that makes waffles that are traditional, not belgian.  Belgian waffles have too deep of squares for me and are too thick to go in a normal toaster.  This waffle maker finally makes normal sized waffles, the size of a piece of bread, with small holes.\n\nIt cooks perfectly every time...the waffles are evenly cooked and slide very easily off when you want to remove them.  They look great and they taste excellent.  It makes four waffles at a time, which was another requirement (I hate little wafflemakers...you can't feed a family on those).  If you have leftovers you can toss them in the fridge and then later in a normal toaster, which makes them crisp and delicious again.  I almost like them better the second time.\n\nThe construction is durable and attractive, not made of that plastic junk that you normally see in a wafflemaker.  I can find no downside to it's construction, all smoothly operating and simple.  It doesn't get dirty, but if it did it would be really simple to pull out the waffle surface and wash it off however you want.\n\nI have no use for the flat side of this waffle iron, so I don't use it.\n\nI have owned a number of waffle irons and I've never been happy with any of them until I got this one.  I bought one for my mother, and will recommend it to anyone who is looking for traditional--not belgian--waffles and wants a precision machine to do it.;Found the perfect waffle iron after so much searching
33;10.0;1.0;87.0;2949;"I've just looked over the other one star reviews to see if maybe there is a some trick to what I've started experiencing, but alas it seems like I'm part of a trend. I bought this griddle/waffle maker because after about 8 years, my previous waffle maker shorted out. It made great waffles every time. This product had the promise of doing that as well as being an all around griddle king - it looks very similar to one I grew up watching my dad use.\n\nWell this product ain't one of those. Don't fry eggs on this thing, because you'll end up with scraped up egg roadkill. It makes good grilled cheese sandwiches and hash browns though. BUT...\n\nThe waffles. Yes I love waffles, a lot in fact. This thing worked great about three times. The time was right and the waffles came right out. But all of a sudden something changed and instead I get a sad view of the interior mid section of my waffles, like some breakfast autopsy scene. I have to thing take the metal grill plates out and soak them because the waffle batter is heat applied to both grill halves. It seems almost no amount of oil/Pam will work now. I suspect some horrible chemical film is sprayed on the metal along with whatever excuse for ""non-stick"" coating, and it wore off, on the food. So its now a metal piece of junk.\n\nWhy is it so hard to find a decent waffle maker these days?";Had promise at first, now it is a poor, poor product.
34;82.0;4.0;5.0;2962;we had one like this before and over time the plates did get burnt oil/carbon caked on -- particularly by spraying vegetable oil on a hot grill.  We are now brushing vegetable oil on before the first round of waffles.  We are happy to have the same type of waffles again.  Belgian waffles are fun, but not for the day-to-day -- they require special batter.\n\nYes, the exterior gets hot but that is not too hard to deal with.  it is a decent, basic appliance that is a good value;decent waffle iron
35;22.0;1.0;50.0;3061;My mother had a waffle maker like this one, passed down from her mother.  Shortly after I became an adult, the heating element of hers finally died and I was left waffle-less for several years.  Then I found this.  I was happy.\n\nI don't know how, but the quality has changed dramatically over the years, despite looking essentially the same.  My mother's/grandmother's waffles NEVER stuck to the plates--even a few times when they were left in until completely charred, they peeled right out without any trouble.  THIS product, however, has the ability to permanently glue any substance into its tiny crevices, regardless of how well cooked.  Even better is the fact that BOTH plates have equal sticking power, making it such that every time you open the iron expecting a waffle, you instead get a view of the inside of what should have been your waffle.\n\nOthers have mentioned that no amount of oil will prevent sticking--I'd like to qualify that: if you use 2-8 tbsp of crisco on each plate prior to making 1-2 sets of waffles, you will _probably_ be able to peel at least the first one off.;A pale, weak, sticky shadow of its former self
36;83.0;4.0;5.0;3095;"I've never owned either panini maker or waffle maker so keep this in mind when reading this review.. it means that I'm not comparing it to other products owned in the past. I'm reviewing this product based on my own requirement and not on anything else.\n\nMy requirements and desires for this product were 1) makes a good panini quickly (about once a week for 1 or 2 people, not a family) 2) washable plates 3) inexpensive 4) option for making waffles if ever I wanted to try.\n\nThe machine has fulfilled all of the requirements above. As I've only dabbled with the wafflemaking option, I won't rate its performance on waffle-making -  strictly on panini-making.\n\nWarm up - it takes around 10 minutes for this machine to pre-heat the metal plates. Once the machine is pre-heated it is quite hot which makes for quick work of panini making. However note that the exterior metal of the machine also gets very hot and you must take care not to touch anywhere except the black plastic parts after the machine has been turned on. Because of this, I would caution parents not to have small children anywhere near this device when it's on.\n\nAdditionally, as other reviewers have noted, the plates are fastened to the device by metal clips and could have been constructed better. I would have been more comfortable if the clips held the plates snugger. Although I've never had an experience of the plates coming declipped, the wiggle room of the clips does contribute to nervousness and caution that although may be wholly psychological is not especially welcome.\n\nPanini-Making - Once the griddle is heated, the sandwich is inserted and pressed. The B&D machine performs quickly, evenly heating sandwiches and leaving a tasty crust layer.\n\nWhat I like best about it is that when some of the fillings spill out of the sandwich and onto the grill (leaving what one would expect to be a gooey mess), it's actually quite easy to clean. I just let the plates cool and by then, the ""goo"" which sometimes contains hard to remove cheese - comes right off without much effort.\n\nAll and all, the machine has met all of my requirements and I am happy with it.\n\nSo, in a nutshell:\nPros: Easy to clean, portable, does a good job making paninis. Like the looks of it. Removable plates. Gets hot.\n\nCons: Clips holding plates could be stiffer. Exterior of machine gets hot. Not best for household with small children.";Perfect for Paninis
37;29.0;1.0;32.0;3165;I never even had a chance to plug this in and try it out.  The griddles don't seat securely, and the metal clips that are supposed to hold them in place are so cheap and flimsy that I couldn't open or close the lid without having the top griddle fall out.  Very dangerous if it had been hot.  How this waffle iron ever received good ratings and UL approval is puzzling.;Shoddy and Dangerous
38;27.0;1.0;33.0;3294;I owned two different units of this product and the nonstick coating on the griddle plates chips very very easily.  I don't know how it chipped.  We don't use metal utensils while cooking and we cleaned it in accordance with the manual instruction.  This is unsafe. I called B&D to see if I can get some satisfaction, but the second supervisor I talked to stated that all they could do is send a replacement AFTER I cut the plug off the unit and mail it back to them along with $7.50.  What kind of warranty is that if I have to pay anything to get a new unit?  Further, I just wanted a refund because it is apparently a design defect.  What a damn hassle and disappointment. You get what you pay for. The George Foreman's nonstick coating lasts longer.;Nonstick coating chips very easily
39;30.0;5.0;31.0;3415;The waffle iron arrived at my doorstep in three days--I'd have spent that much time wandering around in Bed, Bath and Beyond LOOKING for waffle irons.  It was packed well and came out of the box perfect.\n\nMy first batch of waffles was ruined, because I didn't oil the waffle iron enough.  After cleaning up, I kept a brush and a saucer of salad-type oil (canola, I think it was) and made a second batch.  PERFECT-o!  This is going to be a great addition to my kitchen.\n\nThanks!;Great Service and Great Waffles
40;51.0;3.0;13.0;3437;"I agree with the people who are having troubles with the flimsy clips that hold the waffle plates in place.  I guess that some clips come from the factory slightly out of alignment, which makes them drop the upper plate. The clips ARE flimsy, but if you fiddle with them a bit, you can bend them and make them work well. This waffle iron is more cheaply constructed than older versions; someone is saving a few pennies. But you can make it work well if you keep an eye on those flimsy clips.";Flimsy clips for the waffle plates
41;21.0;1.0;54.0;3446;We've had this product for a couple years.  The clips no long hold the plates in.  Just imagine--pouring the batter, then trying to close the lid.  If the top plate does stay in, it certainly will not stay clipped when the waffle is done and you try to lift the lid.  Then you have a very hot mess.\n\nThe only thing we use this for now is pancakes because we can keep both lids open so it does not fall apart.  In my opinion, Black & Decker should recall this evil monster.;Poorly designed product
42;36.0;1.0;22.0;3462;This is the first review I've ever written about a product and I'm only doing so because my experience with this product was so bad.\n\nFirst off, the design is outright dangerous.  I frequently suffered minor burns on the griddle when lifting it to remove my waffles as it's incredibly difficult to open it without touching the grill itself.  If your batter is even slightly sticky, it becomes even more dangerous provided you can get it open at all.  Often, the grill itself would come off its two flimsy hinges and present a whole new problem.  On top of it all when it would work, it would take several minutes for a waffle to cook.\n\nCompared with the replacement waffler that we just purchased, I have a full understanding of how extraordinarily poor this waffler is and hope that no one has to endure what we did with this product.;A Poor and Dangerous Product
43;77.0;2.0;6.0;3468;After a little over 1 1/2 yrs of sporadic use, the grill side can only works on one side, the other is too cool to cook pancakes.  The waffle iron's nonstick surface is not really nonstick.  The squares in the iron are so small cleaning up after the waffle sides stuck together is a chore.  I wouldn't buy this again! The Black & Decker brand gets a Black eye from this product.;Starts off good, but doesn't last
44;15.0;1.0;69.0;3506;I didn't learn the first time!  I bought two of these grills because I thought it was a fluke when the non-stick coating peeled off the first one. We were even more careful with the second one but had the same problem. When I called Black and Decker customer service to buy replacement grills I discovered the replacements cost $55.00 which is almost as much as a new appliance. I hate to throw away a perfectly good electrical appliance. So I won't be buying this particular device again!;Non-stick coating flakes off
45;57.0;2.0;11.0;3536;I have had this waffle iron/grill for about a year and a half. Initially, I loved the griddle, but the non-stick surface wore off and began to flake at about 15-month mark, making it unusable. I took very good care of it and used it about once a week. In my opinion, the problem is that the non-stick surfaces come close to contacting the heating element. Whichever surface you are using (the waffle-maker or the griddle), the opposite side is near the coil, which can't be good for the Teflon (or whatever non-stick coating is used). If you don't need your appliance to last more than a year or so, it does work well, but I expect my appliances to last longer.\n\nAlso, I have to echo comments I read about how hot this appliance gets. Not having kids around, I didn't think it would be a problem, but the outside metal surface (the entire thing) gets hot enough to burn skin. Plus, you have to be careful what you have nearby, as the lifted lid wil burn/melt whatever it touches. Watch out for the cord, as well as anything that's behind or above the appliance.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this product, because I don't think it lasts, and because I have used other products that seem much safer. But for the time I did use it, it worked well. Especially the grille. I definitely recommend against having this in a household with children.;Too Hot/Non-Stick Fails
46;12.0;5.0;80.0;3555;This is our second purchase of this same model over many years and have found it to be of good quality, reliable, and attractive square waffle maker. The removable cooking plates make clean up a snap and allows unit to be used for pancakes and sandwich cooking also. The temp control knob can be set to produce desired doneness everytime. I highly recommend this model.;Reliable, attractive product
47;58.0;5.0;11.0;3593;I was researching different waffle makers and didn't find any with consistently good reviews. Then I came across this item which has plates that switch over to grill sandwiches or other items. The price was right and it received good reviews, so I purchased it. The waffles come out just right and the grill side makes fantastic grilled sandwiches so quickly and easily. The plates are easy to clean and the product looks great as well.;I love this product
48;41.0;5.0;18.0;3621;This is the 2nd waffle iron I've purchased and I am SO happy with it. My waffles come out perfect every time. They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

51;52.0;1.0;13.0;3702;I have owned two (2) Waffle Iron & Grill products in my lifetime, but this was by far the worst product because of its construction.  The pin that holds the grills in place is certainly inadequate and it was obvious upon inspection that the heat was going to impact the clip's ability to hold the grill in place during baking. Very poor quality.;Black & Decker Waffle Iron & Grill
52;85.0;5.0;5.0;3723;I have wanted a decent waffle maker for quite a while. A cheap model my wife picked up a few years ago was pure junk and didn't even have an adjustable temperature setting. Since it seems to be impossible to find anything except Belgian style models in any stores, I started doing some research online.\n\nThe Black and Decker G48TD looks like the old 1950's model my parents had except it has aluminum grids instead of cast iron like the older one. Although the B&D model had a pretty high overall rating in reviews, it did have a number of complaints about sticking waffles and poorly holding grid clips so I was a little concerned at first. However, since all the other waffle maker reviews I found were overall lower in user satisfaction, I decided to buy the G48TD - and I'm really glad I did!\n\nI think the aluminum grid plates are great and the clips hold mine in place very securely.  The browning is surprisingly even although the bottom does, as others have reported, get a little more heat than the top. I found that very minor in mine and it certainly didn't detract from the quality or taste of the resulting waffles. I also followed the grid conditioning instructions precisely and haven't had a sticking waffle yet. It does take a little force sometimes to lift the lid but there hasn't been any tearing or sticking of the waffles themselves. I do use a quick spray of a no-stick oil product before initial heating each cooking session.\n\nSince my real interest is only in waffles, I haven't tried the grilling capabilities of the G48TD.\n\nPro's:  Great tasting waffles and consistent cooking.\n\n Adjustable temperature control with a  useful  range.\n\n No sticking if prepped as in the instructions.\n\nCon's:  Housing does get very hot in use and can burn fingers.\n\n  Temperature knob moves a little too easily and can be  inadvertently set to another temperature if nudged by accident when moving the waffle maker.;The Best Waffle Maker Out There!
53;86.0;3.0;5.0;3758;I am medium happy with this product.\n\nOf course the space saving - Toaster and Grill in one device - is great. And I especially like the grilled Paninis we are making with the grill. The waffles have a great tendency to stick, even if I use a lot of oil.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the non-stick coating had bubbles, so even after 1 week of mild use and mild cleaning, we have pea-sized holes in the coating on the grilling-surface. Also, the handles become really hot, when the device is on and when you turn the plates to go from toaster to grill, you can see the innards of it and that the quality seems rather cheap.\n\nStill the price was ok and it performs it's functions well.;Medium happy
54;67.0;4.0;8.0;3773;"It gets four stars only because the exterior gets so hot; else it's a five star product.  I requested it as a Christmas gift after Cooks Illustrated gave it a top recommendation.\n\nThe nonstick has been, as advertised, non-sticky.  I use plain vegetable shortening (Crisco) at the beginning of a waffle session and I'm set.  I wonder if those who have had problems were using an aerosol spray, like PAM, which are known to cause stickiness on non-stick surfaces.\n\nIt heats up fast enough and cooks the waffles evenly.\n\nI've not used the griddle side, but I would anticipate the same issues when flipping the iron/griddle that I always had with my parents' West Bend -- the first few items after a flip are more likely to stick, thus more shortening was needed.  I let the shortening bake in for a few minutes to sort of season the grids and the iron was good to go.\n\nAs for the customer who wanted an audio signal when the waffle was done...sounds good, but I've never seen a model with that feature.  And what is the sensor?  Is it a timer or a temperature sensor?  I open the iron when the waffle has stopped steaming, and it's done.  When using different types of batter, yeasted vs chemically raised, pumpkin vs plain, etc, it can take longer.

55;24.0;1.0;40.0;3786;I was sooo disappointed with this waffle iron. It's the worst piece of garbage that I have ever purchased. And very poorly made.

I assumed that it was just a defective iron, so I returned it and was sent a replacement. It too, gave me the same problems. I wasted so much batter on this piece of junk. I threw it in the trash. This product is a total waste of time and money. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy it.;what a waste!?!
56;68.0;1.0;8.0;3830;I'm very disappointed by how poorly this grill performs. The main problem is that everything sticks to it, no matter how well it is oiled. I followed the directions and can't get it to work properly. It's going into the junk bin!!;Very Disappointing

Mom is almost 85 now, and she wanted me to have one for my 61st birthday--we had looked everywhere and finally found it on Amazon. We're so happy and making memories again.  I'm going to surprise her with one for her 85th!;"""Mama's Wafflemaker"""
59;7.0;5.0;196.0;3845;"This is a great waffle maker!!  Every time we make waffles, they flip right out just like they're supposed to.  We haven't had any of them get stuck or had any of the disasters/frustrations that we've had with other waffle irons.  It's actually easy to make a waffle again.  Can you imagine!?  I think the reason why is that the Teflon is good and it gets hot, evenly.\n\nAfter you get it, my recommendation would be to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS that comes with it.  Just before preheating, brush on some vegetable oil like it says to do.  (I guess you can use spray but we've found the oil at first works best.)  After that, you won't need anything at all for the other batches.  Also, be sure not to mess up the Teflon coating by washing it while it's still hot (let it cool off completely) or by using utensils that will scratch it up, like metal forks and scrubbers.  If you take care of this sensitive Teflon, it will take care of you.  I think it says not to put it in the dishwasher so you probably don't want to.  Both plates, top and bottom, are completely removable and they're really easy to clean with a basic sponge...don't use the scrubby side of the sponge though...you won't need to anyway.\n\nWe've made waffles several times already and they've been perfect every time.  It DOES get really hot but that's a good thing.  We've also flipped it over to the grill side and that's great too.  We've made quesadillas, grilled cheese sandwiches, and burgers.  For burgers, it has a trench like thing around the border of the grill that the fat collects in.  You'll need a little cup or something to catch it where it supposed to drip out.\n\nIf you really want it to ""drain the fat away"" fast like a Forman type grill, just put something under the back left leg to tilt it a bit.  Don't put something under the leg that could catch fire though....again, say it with me, ""It gets really hot!""  We've been placing it on our stove top when we use it...if you have sensitive counter tops, do that too.\n\nIf you make a sandwich, keep the grill open and flip the sandwich as needed.  Otherwise, your sandwich will get really flat.  I think that's it -- It really is one of our better purchases lately and so we take good care of it.  Oh, and adding a nice amount of vanilla extract to your waffle batter makes them delicious!!  (wife said to throw that in) Happy Waffle'n!";Great Waffles...Finally!  A solid review found here.

I just give a light spray of non-stick cook spray and all is fine. This is after I oiled it down to get started. Do not skip this step, it is vital to keep the unit non-sticking .

61;69.0;2.0;8.0;3920;"I have this waffle baker for some time now.\n\nI don't know if i done something wrong, but even when buttering the surface i cant make waffles without sticking it.\n\nOnly way waffles can be done in this machine is that i use significant amounts of butter on both sides, killing the taste of my waffles, featured in Williams Sonoma Collection - Breakfast - as ""Buttermilk Waffles"".\n\nI also have a Salton Singles waffle maker, bought incredibly in 1991, works fine, needs buttering only the first time, making up to 25 waffles without needing to re-butter it\n\nAlso, I consider a health hazard using the bd waffle iron. Device does not fold in a safely manner, and steam comes from all sides of device. Hope this was helpful";Design is great, although nonstick is sticky
62;70.0;4.0;8.0;3949;I really love this waffle iron.  We used it when I was a kid.  It makes the best waffles and pancakes.  So far I've only been able to use my in the laying flat position to make turkey bacon and pancakes.  The turned out so good because the unit cooks evenly.  I haven't been able to use it as a waffle maker yet because the top hook that holds the top plate in place is loose.  So the top plate slides off while making waffles.  I had my husband look at it.  He fixed it by squeezing it to make it tighter.  Hopefully this works, if not I'll return it.;Just like the one my mom had
63;80.0;5.0;6.0;3963;Well, I remember my mom having this type of waffle maker.  I looked for one for years.  Yes I know this one is differently made.  But cooking waffles on it has sure brought back those memories.  I can't wait to try and do sandwitches on the other side.  I do wish that the plate were dishwasher safe but I am glad they pop off so that you can clean them easily.\n\nAs for my waffle recipe, I just used the one on the back of the Jiffy Baking mix box. While mixing my ingredients, I preheated my grill for about 5 minutes with the setting about 3/4 of the way on the waffle setting. Then I sprayed with cooking spray. I poured my batter and in about 6 minutes my waffles were done. My husband likes his waffles a little less brown than I do so his were done in 4-5 minutes.\n\nIt is very hot, so be sure to take precautions not to have it where children can touch it.  Also, steam comes out the side while cooking, so be careful of that.;Waffles almost like moms
64;89.0;5.0;5.0;3975;"This is a GREAT waffle iron!  We love that it makes the ""classic"" style waffles.  We started with the Toastmaster 2 slice waffle iron, but quickly found out that with a family of 6 it was taking FOREVER!!!  This waffle iron cooks our waffles (we mill our own flour) in about 6 minutes and they are Yuuummmy!  My kids are always asking for waffles for breakfast and I am happy to oblige!  We now operate both and we are eating in less than 15 minutes!  SUPER easy to clean thanks to the removable plates -- these really are a MUST have!  I've never attempted to touch the top of the grill during cooking, but from the other reviewers, I know that it would be foolish to do so.  Anyway, if you are looking for a great, no frills waffle iron that gets the job done and one that you KNOW can be properly cleaned, this is the one for you!  Hope this is helpful!";Yum, Yum Waffles
65;71.0;5.0;8.0;3976;"I just got rid of two pretty new waffle makers,mainly for the non removable grids. The Black and Decker is like my old Westinghouse I had for years. This is straight forward and you don't have to keep playing with it to ""tune it"". I have used both waffle and grill, I couldn't be more pleased, this is definitely a keeper, oh yes, the price is unreal.";Chickie

67;59.0;3.0;11.0;3992;I bought one of these about 5 years ago and used it at least once a week.  It recently died on me and when I looked around, I ended up purchasing exactly the same product because I really couldn't find anything similar.  It works great for waffles and doing one small waffle at a time is not efficient enough for a family- so this can feed at least 2 people at a time as they're cooking.  Flipping the unit open you can use it as a griddle and cook 2 large pancakes at a time.  It works very effectively and dependably.  The top does get a little hotter than the bottom, so I always pour the first pancake on the bottom side and remove the pancake from the top side first.  Clean-up is simple and I like the versatility of griddle or waffle-baker.\n\nThe only downside- I had hoped it would last longer than 5 years, but I figured that was a reasonable enough length of time to purchase another.\n\nUpdate 1/8/09 - after less than 4 years use, my second unit died on me.  That's just not good enough for me and I won't be buying another one.;Great for waffles or pancakes, but not a long life
68;64.0;5.0;9.0;4026;"An excellent upgrade to the waffle iron/griddle I grew up with.  The new version has heavy aluminum grids instead of the cast iron ones from years ago but the performance is still great.\n\nIf you are looking for a waffle iron that makes the old fashioned waffles with small indentations, this is a great choice.  The stores only carry ""belgian"" style irons these days.\n\nOf course the reversible grids still allow you to use it for grilled sandwiches and pancakes.  Highly recommended all around.";Excellent update to classic design.
69;11.0;4.0;97.0;4059;"Those people who say they are looking for an ""old fashioned waffle iron"", and have actually _used_ an ""old fashioned waffle iron"", will enjoy this iron.  I was searching for a real waffle iron, the kind that makes crispy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside waffles.  This waffle iron is just the thing.  It really is old-fashioned:  It does get very hot on the outside, which is to be _expected_ with a chrome waffle iron - whoever is surprised by that isn't old enough to use this appliance.  The non-stick plates work as well as any other non-stick pan.  They still require some oiling, and the waffle recipe has to include oil as well.  I keep the iron closed while it heats up; it takes about 5 minutes to reach full-heat.  That's just enough time for me to mix my waffle mix and let it rest before baking.  I found that if I time the waffle baking for exactly 3 minutes, the waffles come out perfect every time.  This is not your child's Easy Bake Waffle Iron - if you want that, go buy one of those plastic things.  For adult use only.";Good Waffles - Adult Use Only!
70;60.0;5.0;11.0;4075;I have had this waffle iron for 3 years and am extremely pleased.  We make waffles about once a week and we get perfect waffles every time.  If you treat it like a cast iron pan, and don't wash regularly, it won't stick.  Just wipe down with a paper towel. It is hot to the touch, so just be careful around it.;Great waffles
71;48.0;1.0;16.0;4091;I liked the compact design, size and ability to reverse the cooking plates, so I ordered this griddle.\n\nI found that the griddle actually worked okay, particularly as a waffle iron, but the allegedly non-stick plates weren't really non-stick (took me 20 minutes to clean the plates after waffles!). What's worse, when in use, the outside top of the baker got hot enough to melt the plastic on my coffee machine. I found this out when I opened the baker to remove a waffle and without realizing it, leaned the top against the coffee machine behind it. When I went to close it again, I got stringy molten plastic bridging the gap. Oops.\n\nAfter cleaning up this mess, I wanted to see just how hot the outside got. I proceeded to bake another round of waffles, and then sprayed the top with spray oil and put an egg on it. Some of the egg ran off the side, but the egg that stayed was cooked within a few seconds.\n\nThis thing is not only a hazard to anyone prone to accidentally burning themselves, but is also a mess magnet. I'll have none of it anymore!;lacking in the common sense department
72;40.0;4.0;20.0;4149;We wanted regular waffles - not belgian - and not tiny ones. This wafflemaker makes large waffles that don't stick and cook fairly quickly. This new wafflemaker replaces the same model I had for many years. The only reason for a replacement was that I dropped it and broke the hinge. Only downside is that it is hot to the touch - but I think that is true of all models.;Dependable wafflemaker
73;38.0;4.0;23.0;4151;We have had an almost identical model by another manufacturer. It lasted for years with waffles almost every Sunday night. ( A good tradition - church in the morning and waffles in the evening. ) The only comparison we can make with the other is that these plates are not clipped as well to the housing. -Please note B&D. If you want regular waffles and like to grill sandwiches ( the reversible plates ), this is as good as you will find. Good controls. We are happy with our purchase.;Sunday Night Waffles
74;17.0;5.0;67.0;4183;I have had this waffle iron for 16 years.  I don't have any other appliance that is still alive and working perfectly after so long.  This used to be sold under the brand GE, before they spun it off to B & D.  It makes perfect waffles and pancakes, and nothing sticks, even though I use NO grease or oil except what's in my recipe.  The outside does get very hot, but as long as you are careful it's not a problem.  The plates switch from flat griddle side to waffle side, and cleanup is a breeze, since nothing sticks.\n\nThis is the last griddle/waffle iron you will ever buy.  You will leave this baby to your grandchildren, I am not kidding.;A classic that is as good as it was decades ago
75;74.0;4.0;7.0;4211;This item is ideal for the person that wants to save space and also wants to have a grill as well as a waffle maker.  The cast plates are none stick and reversable to provide two cooking means with one appliance.  This item does a good job of grilling and also makes ideal waffles.;Grill--Waffle baker
76;72.0;5.0;8.0;4220;This is very similar to the one my parents had when I was growing up.  Simple to use, makes a great waffle.  I have had various cool touch appliances and didn't like them, so when my last waffle maker died (it was 40+ years old), I didn't know what I would do.  Found this one and love it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a great, easy-to-use waffle maker griddle.;Great waffle baker
77;81.0;5.0;6.0;4256;Great combo waffle iron and pancake griddle.  Our last one performed wonderfully for over 20 years.;Wonderful, versatile product
78;55.0;2.0;13.0;4303;I was excited to find this waffle maker since it looked exactly like the one my parents used for 20 years.  It worked great for a short while, then I noticed that one side of the griddle was not heating as fast as the other producing uneven pancakes and waffles!  Now it's unusable all around.  The waffles are sticking and burning no matter how much I season the plates and I can make 3 times as many pancakes on one side of the griddle as on the other because of the uneven heat!  I'd like to say I'll buy another in hopes that I just got a bad appliance, but I'm not sure I want to risk throwing away the money.;Disappointed...
79;32.0;5.0;31.0;4317;These old fashioned sandwich grill/waffle irons aren't easy to find anymore, but my parents finally found this one instead of a basic griddle I had asked for last Christmas.  It's pretty much like the old ones they used for pancakes, waffles, and sandwiches while I was growing up, except it seems to heat more consistently and evenly than the old ones.  After properly oiling the grids and a practice run or two, it makes perfect waffles and pancakes, and it fulfills the role of a griddle and sandwich grill just as well.  (Isn't the whole point of this thing those great mashed hot ham 'n' cheese or barbecue sandwiches?)  This is kitchen technology that was perfected many years ago.  Much more versatile than all the other grills, griddles, and waffle irons out there, and performs each function as well as any of them.;Old school perfection
80;28.0;4.0;38.0;4383;"I was looking for a larger-capacity waffle maker for my family (I already owned a round waffle maker), which wasn't ""Belgian style."" This fit the bill perfectly.  Although it's fairly ""cheap"" construction-wise, it does a great job cooking waffles. One of the best features is the way you can adjust the temperature. My round waffle maker never seemed to get hot enough to make truly crispy waffles. This one does. I had a $25 certificate which made the price right. It is pricey otherwise, especially considering the quality of the construction. But it is a good performer.";Makes crisp waffles
81;42.0;5.0;20.0;4542;My mother has had one for 30 or 40 years which works great. Growing up we had weekly waffles for a family of nine. My wife and I have now had one, which we bought used at a yard sale, for 16 years and been very happy with it for waffles and grilled cheese sandwiches for our family of five. I would not want a unit that did fewer than four waffles at a time. My son, attempting to be helpful, washed it in water which got into the electronics. Unfortunately it was not yet dry the next time we went to use it - sparks and smoke. So, it is time to replace it. After much searching we're going with the same thing. It is reliable and does the job.\n\nBy the by, two tricks for making extra thick waffles:\n\n1) cut in whipped egg whites\n\n2) seperate the top plate a bit - I use a couple of butter knives (which get hot so use a mitt).;Excellent, reliable product

(Very important for that melted Cheese over the edge!) Makes 4 waffles at a time. This is not a product to let your children use. The outside lovely chrome surfaces get extremely hot when in use and take a while to cool off after use. Try a Black & Decker citrus juicer if the kids want to help. They will enjoy that very much, and you'll have fresh juice to go with your waffles!  :-);Easy to use and clean- Try a Grilled Ham & Cheese!
83;63.0;5.0;11.0;5001;"Yep,\nIf you had one of these grills in the past, then you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Sadly after 30 years in service, my old unit died and was sent to appliance heaven. Since then I've been on a quest to find a replacement for it in ALL my local malls. Let me tell ya folks, I wasted a LOT OF TIME and GAS when I SHOULD HAVE searched right here on Amazon.com for it.\nIn my search to find this grill, I've seen every make and model, and NONE of them impressed me like this unit. It's built to withstand the rigorous of time and, it brings back all those old childhood memories of Sunday morning, when the smell of waffles wafted through the hallways. Yep, this grill makes the best waffles you'd ever want!!! TRUST, I've tried plenty of other griddles but, they just don't compare. Now, if ONLY I could find that syrup that we used to use. I think it was called ""Tea Garden Drips""? If you know where I can find this product now, then by all means, send me an email and make my Sunday mornings complete once again.\nGreat Griddle!!......Great Price!!\nCiao!!!";Just like Mom used to make.
84;84.0;5.0;6.0;5070;"My mom used this when I was little- I remember loving it when she pulled it out.  That meant something yummy was coming!  I got this one about two weeks ago, and I couldn't be happier with it.  I've used it 5 or 6 times a week- pancakes and waffles are soooooo easy, and I can ""customize"" the recipes (whole wheat apple cinnamon waffles and strawberry pancakes are amazing!).  As long as you remember to keep the griddle sprayed with a (very) little oil or cooking spray, you'll have no problems. And it does get hot, so be careful when you're using it.  I'm making a list of people who will be getting this for Christmas!";A Million Uses!
85;65.0;1.0;10.0;5098;If only this waffle iron would perform as well as it looks.  The design is great: chrome finish, removable waffle iron surface.  We were very excited about this product and have been nothing but disappointed.\nFirst, I burned the you know what out of myself the first time we used it.  Other reviewers have said it before, the outside surface of this unit gets VERY hot!\nSecond, waffles just don't turn out well.  My old cheap [$$$]waffle iron used to turn out perfect, crisp waffles.  With this one, they are always chewy.  I don't believe the iron is hot enough to properly cook crisp delicious waffles.  I would recommend staying away from this appliance.;Too Hot to Touch, Not Hot Enough for Great Waffles
86;2.0;5.0;975.0;5180;"I love this waffle maker!  It's like the ones our mom used, not those cheesy seeming plastic things they're making now.  It's also got a lot of excellent features that make my life easier.\nI'll mention right now that this is a VERY hot waffle maker.  They make the plastic ones to be ""cool touch"".  I'll trade the cool touch feature for the sturdier design of this versatile machine. I'm being careful and haven't burned myself yet. But it's something to consider if you'd like your children making waffles.  My ten year old could be careful enough, but I keep my five and eight year olds away.\nThe waffles this machine makes are great!  They freeze well too.  The family is very happy. When the light goes of the unit is ready to make waffles. Pour in the batter and the light comes on again--wait for it to go off and the waffle is done (however, I usually go on instinct and sometimes pull out the waffle before the light goes off.)\nThe open grill feature makes wonderful pancakes and fried eggs.  I have a big family and it's nice to have two pancakes cook at a shot without taking up all my stovetop!  I can have bacon and eggs on the stove and the pancakes on the waffle maker.  (I can also have a heart attack if I keep eating all these bacon and eggs!)\nThe sandwich feature is nice.  I can cook two grilled cheese sandwiches at one time getting me out of the kitchen quicker.  Some advice--cheese might drip out the side of the sandwich.  Just keep the sandwich away from the back of the unit where the cables run in and the mess just wipes off--no problem.  The sandwiches cook far more uniformly than they do in a pan on the stove.  They taste great.\nThis unit cleans up easily and changing the grills from waffle to flat is easy.  I recommend it over a lot of more costly models if you want more value for your money.  This is the most versatile waffle maker I've found and all the features actually work!";One HOT waffle maker!
87;3.0;5.0;413.0;5336;I got this one after unsuccessfully trying the Cuisinart waffle maker.  It is wonderful!  None of the batters, not even gluten-free ones would stick.

88;4.0;4.0;378.0;5356;Back in the 60's I loved the Sundays my Dad made waffles on a toastmaster Waffle/grill. He would add cinnamon, fruit, all kinds of things. Never stuck always light and fluffy. When I went to college my odyssey began. I have gone through 4! different brands and here is why you want this machine - Ok Betty Crocker and others may have a beeper but the waffle that comes out could have come out of a toaster, B&D lets you choose on a dark to light waffle 'zone' with a light that goes out when it reaches that temp. Even with a thick from the box batter out came the most fluffy waffle with a Belgium like crust. Take a close look at this baby it's CROME and yes it will get hot, (kids don't touch) but unlike others it CLEANS UP. Overflows are no problem. Just as good a George Forman. And grilled sandwiches were wonderful but I use old world bakery bread with brie and dry salami, again adjust for light and dark. Favorite recipe? Coco for a chocolate waffle and chocolate chip ice cream to make a sandwich. This is an 'open and closed' case and really is space saver 3 in 1 product for our family.;Now I know why I liked waffles as a little kid
89;26.0;2.0;46.0;5419;"I have several Black and Decker products, but this one really disappointed me.  It works fine for the waffles and I like the waffle timer.  But you can forget the sandwiches.  This product needs an adjustment made to the spring or either the sandwiches grids made deeper.  My daughter used it first for grilled cheese sandwiches.  Dissaster.  The top of the grill is too heavy.  The cheese melted all over the grids and the sandwiches were as flat as a pancake.  I thought it was her that did something wrong. So I tried it; same thing, cheese melted all over the grids and bread flatter than pancakes.  B&D has some good products; but, I don't know what happened here.  I hope they can fix this problem.  I would like to have a good old fashioned grilled cheese sandwich like my mother use to make.  She had a good waffle and sandwich maker.  Of course that was 50 years ago and I forget the manufacturer.  I did return this with no problem.  I hope B&D can rectify the problem.  Thank You.";Waffles, not sandwiches

0;2.0;5.0;5.0;0;Really not much to say.  We're homeschoolers, and use this globe all the time.  It seems well-made.  Great size--not so big you can't sit it anywhere, not so small you can't see anything.  The raised relief is well-done.  I've tried several other globes and been disappointed, so I'm speaking from some experience here.\n\nI would recommend this globe.  It's just . . . good.;Good Globe
1;8.0;4.0;8.0;23;This is a pretty good globe, to be fair it is a good gift for a child that has an interest in learning about the world, and would like a visual representation.\n\nPros: The globe has a lot of detail, specifically it has the US states. Which is a feature that is not easy to find for mid priced globes. The size is good, so the different regions are relatively easy to recognize, no need for magnifying glass. There are also raised areas to represent mountainous regions which is pretty cool.\nCon: The biggest issue is the huge blue band around the center of the globe which goes through several continents. The product picture show the band, so there was no misrepresentation by the seller, I just didn't realize how prominent it would be.;This is a pretty good globe
2;22.0;5.0;6.0;172;"There is quite a lot of appropriate detail on the globe considering the scale. But the detail is not over-done which can lead to confusion on some maps and globes as ""too much information"" which is really a distraction.  National boundaries are clear and distinct, easy to locate.  Latitude and longitude, the features I was seeking, are distinct and well labeled.  The lines match up. The ocean floor mountain ranges and other land forms are included and are quite interesting.  The globe is mounted on a durable metal stand/frame.  If one wants a globe with up-to-date national boundaries, Replogle offers  discount on a new globe.  Personally I do not find it necessary that a globe contain the latest name or boundary.  Like any map, a globe is a document of changing history.\nI was particularly impressed with the quality and forethought of the internal packaging in the shipping box.  The globe is securely held in place to prevent movement and damage.  The internal packaging will also protect the globe from a good measure of rough handling in shipment.  With this much concern to insure the globe arrives in good condition, I am further impressed with the over-all dedication of Replogle in producing a quality product.\nI am very well pleased with the features of the globe and the high quality of construction.  It is a convenient size for a desk and of course it is easily moved about.";An excellent choice for a globe

4;14.0;2.0;19.0;465;I know globes are expensive.  I thought for the money this one would work.  It's fair.  A couple of things... There is a small area that looks like it missed coloring during the printing process.  It's a small imperfection, about a 1/4 inch, but the area is just not there.  And there are some letters missing from the representation. Also, the globe just doesn't appear to be well made.  The stand looks cheap and the printed paper is not lined up well.  The second is that the globe is in Spanish.  I don't think that was mentioned in the description.  Whatever the case, it wasn't glaringly obvious.  I feel like that is a big no no if sellers aren't right upfront.  I have been buying from Amazon for a long time and I have had a few more hiccups in product quality over the past year than normal.  Save your money on this one.  It's not worth it.;Not a w
5;31.0;4.0;7.0;563;I was pleased with the Globe. I was fearful when ordering it due to some negative comments I read, but I was pleasantly surprised that it looks great. There are a few lines that do not line up perfectly but they are not off by enough to stress over. Overall, for my homeschool classroom, it's perfect.;Pleased with the purchase.
6;36.0;5.0;6.0;623;Was so impressed with this globe when we received it.  Although we purchased it for our grandson for Christmas, we are going to get us one for our home  It is not only beautiful to look at it is intriguing to just stand by it and twirl it around and look at all it has to offer.  I was jealous he was getting it and I wasn't keeping it for us, ha!  Would highly recommend this globe to families, children, or even us older adults.  Very good product!;Impressive!!
7;4.0;2.0;59.0;667;"The sections were poorly put together with many of the longitude lines not meeting as they ""crossed"" the equator.  It has been many years since I purchased a new globe.  I hope this was a fluke as I will be returning this one.";Longitude line problem
8;44.0;5.0;5.0;771;"When my granddaughter, age 5, took this globe out of the box, she said ""This is the best day of my life!""  We keep it out so she can peruse it at her leisure.  She continues to ask questions about the countries - we bought a children's atlas to go along with it - that helps quite a bit to clarify the countries and showcase the various people.";"she said ""This is the best day of my life"
9;34.0;5.0;7.0;793;Came well packaged and quality is pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend placing it where it could be pulled off a table or anything since it would likely break, but my young kids love looking at it and putting in perspective where different places are.  I also like explaining day and night to them by turning off all lights in the room except one which represents the sun and then we spin the globe slowly to show day and night.;Happy with this globe
10;18.0;5.0;17.0;814;l read some of the reviews before buying this globe and I was skeptical about it especially because I read the Northern hemisphere wasn't aligned with the Southern hemisphere, but when I got it everything was aligned. There was only 1 or 2 longitude/s line that was misaligned but you really have to look for it. It was about a quarter of a centimeter off, not a big deal. Some people I guess had bad luck.;Pretty damn good globe!
11;27.0;5.0;9.0;826;This globe is awesome! It's great quality, easy to read, has time zone info and looks great. Beautiful and Functional. I absolutely love it and the price point is great! I put it in my office and have gotten so many compliments on it!;Beautiful and functional!
12;39.0;4.0;6.0;844;I like it, I really like the books that came with it, but the color of the water is not blue, on mine,( like it seems to represent) it is a light green blue.\nI think it is well worth the the money. I bought it to learn more about everything that is going on the in world and you can learn a lot.;I like it, I really like the books that came ...
13;16.0;5.0;22.0;885;The look of this globe is out of this world!  It is bright, colorful, and is profiled to reveal mountain ranges.  There are many other useful features - like shipping routes. It is large enough for a clear view of even some of the tiniest island groupings.  The company also gives you the option of updating your globe at lower cost if their are major political changes on the world map.  It looks great in my den/office.;Out of this world.
14;1.0;1.0;178.0;905;"Feeling kinda jipped after looking at my globe. The work seems pretty shoddy with how ""off"" some of the latitude and longitude lines are - not matching up (see pics). I guess I'll have to pretend there was a major earthquake that shifted some of the countries. There was also some threading on the globe where I now have a bare cardboard colored line, pretty annoying. I'd return this if I bought it from a store or had a more serious use for this.";Shoddy Letdown
15;32.0;1.0;8.0;947;Terrible quality. It was a Christmas 2014 gift, and broke in less than three months. It fell off the stand, and there's no way to reattach it because part of the fastening components are inside the globe. Awful globe. Don't buy.;Broke after less than three months
16;49.0;5.0;5.0;951;"This is a ""for the price"" review. Good amount of detail for this price point, and same globe as used in higher priced models. It is the cheapest 12"" model with a metal stand that I could find. As pointed out by some others, the assembly quality is indifferent -- not all the lines line up. But it is not as bad as some pictures others have posted here, and the content is still legible enough.";Good amount of detail for this price point
17;41.0;5.0;6.0;955;"Very good globe with excellent print quality.  I am using this as a visual prop for an astronomy talk to explain how seasons and the lunar orbit works.\n\nThe stand, although it feels light weight and ""flimsy"" has handled multiple car trips so far with no damage or weakening that I can see.  Would suggest this model to someone looking at a 12"" globe.  Thank you.";Very good globe with excellent print quality
18;20.0;5.0;17.0;969;Perfect school globe. Labeled clearly. Mountain ranges have raised surfaces. Ocean currents marked. Locations clearly and legibly identified.  Just the right size. Save the enclosed coupon to get a free replacement when globe is updated.;Perfect school globe
19;50.0;3.0;5.0;1001;Good quality but found for almost half the price at Toys-R-Us;Good and Bad
20;9.0;3.0;45.0;1015;I really want to love this globe 5 stars worth, but we bought this globe for our homeschooling family and I was a bit disappointed with the construction. The top and bottom half are not exactly put together. It is about a cm off. That doesnt seem like a lot, but with small countries or islands it is. For the price paid, I expected it to be lined up correctly.;top and bottom not lined up properly
21;51.0;5.0;5.0;1026;Bought as a gift for my daughter who is a teacher.  She was fascinated with the raised relief for the mountains.;A teacher's delight
22;42.0;5.0;6.0;1037;Very nice globe. I love the raised relief elements to it. A good size, well-made. Perfect for school or your child at home. Good product and well-made.;Very nice globe. I love the raised relief elements to ...
23;35.0;5.0;8.0;1102;I travel a lot.  I wanted one for my kids to learn geography and where I travel.  It's pretty good.;Not bad.
24;43.0;5.0;6.0;1103;Good sturdy globe. Gift for my grandson and it reminds everyone of the globes we gad as kids.;Five Stars
25;23.0;4.0;13.0;1108;Great resource for viewing the world outside our own little space.  Good globe for the price.;Four Stars
26;26.0;4.0;11.0;1109;Bought this globe for my son's nursery. I didn't pay too much attention to the size. It's bigger than I thought but will keep. Like the details.;Bigger than expected
27;7.0;5.0;66.0;1195;This was a gift and its better than we expected. The gift was for a five year old and the globe is good enough to handle his roughhousing. The base is very sturdy and the globe is very accurate. I expect to see this on his desk for years to come;Sturdy enough for a five year old. Very accurate.
28;11.0;5.0;34.0;1211;No assembly required.  Light weight.  It works as I expected.  The quality is as expected for the price. Good buy.;No assembly required
29;12.0;5.0;32.0;1256;Received earlier then expected. It is exactly what I had wanted.\nIt s very easy to view and attractive. I enjoy using it as I watch the news.\nIt is nice to be able to see exactly where places are that are mentioned in the newscasts.;Excellant Globe
30;37.0;4.0;8.0;1263;It is a decent Globe, but does not meet my expectation. I guess I was expecting too much. The raised relief is not that great.;Raised Relief?
31;10.0;5.0;47.0;1310;Has all major and most minor geographical references - plenty for education through (probably) high school!  My kids and I enjoy finding places mentioned on the news, locating everywhere we've been, and trying to find something new every day.;Great globe for children
32;54.0;3.0;5.0;1350;The meridians don't all line up and the equator line was bubbled and coming up in a few places when we received it. It does have a solid base and turns smoothly. In general it is good enough for our small children to learn from. The original listed price of $71.36 would be an outrageous price for the quality of globe, but I bought it for $49.95 which is much closer to reasonable.;Not great, but alright.
33;21.0;4.0;19.0;1364;This globe is nice for a desk or small table. I have always wanted a globe, since looking at flat maps is kind of deceiving. Good value for the price.;Replogle Desktop Globe
34;52.0;1.0;6.0;1522;We ordered the Explorer English World Globe by Brookstone on August 14 after seeing the globe photo and reading the description and great reviews. Imagine the disappointment to receive a red felt banner instead! We called Brookstone Customer Service expecting a quick resolution to the mix-up, only to be told by Kara that Brookstone does not sell this item on Amazon!! Brookstone offered to refund our purchase price, but refused to honor our original order. We then discovered that the globe photo previously attached to this item has been replaced by a photo of the banner we were shipped. All other parts of the display including description and reviews remain the same, but, trust me, you'll get a banner instead of a globe if you order this Brookstone item.;CAUTION - You're buying the banner, not a globe
35;55.0;5.0;5.0;1590;I was not sure about spending so much on a globe for a kid but after receiving this globe it clearly was built to last and worth the price.;Solid construction -great value
36;40.0;5.0;8.0;1653;This globe is great, lines match up.  I homeschool my children and it is a great way to help them learn some geography!;Great
37;56.0;5.0;5.0;1666;I ordered this globe for my granddaughter for her sixth birthday, since this was one of the main items on her list. She was thrilled to receive it, and couldn't wait to get home and take it out of the box. After that, she made a point of showing us where all the different members of her family live, and where different parts of the world are. She loved the blue oceans and other bodies of water, and was impressed to be able to tell which were the largest and highest mountains by the rsised surfaces on the globe.;"Replogle Explorer 12"" Blue English Globe"
38;47.0;5.0;7.0;1775;Very sturdy globe, and easy to read names.  It's a relief globe and you can really feel the mountains.  It's for a grandchild and I know she'll learn much from it.;Globe
39;28.0;2.0;13.0;1797;The relief on this globe was off by a good inch when measuring at the equator, meaning mountain ranges were in the wrong places. The stand was pretty wobbly, and it was nearly impossible spin the globe quickly because it was so light and the stand kind of flimsy. If you need a quick globe and don't care about quality, this one would work, but if you want one to keep for years and to be accurate then buy something more expensive and of a different brand.;Low quality globe
40;17.0;3.0;30.0;1814;The globe looks great, but the stand doesn't weigh enough.  You have to hold the stand down to turn the globe, otherwise the globe pushes away as you spin it and the spinning is stiff.  It's sitting on my desk and I can only allow students to use it with supervision upon request until I figure out a way to put weight on the bottom--which adds to the price of the globe.  I wish I had known this before purchasing and before I threw away the box. Eek!;Not weighted
41;58.0;5.0;5.0;1970;"My 6-year-old grandson requested this for Christmas.  He and his 8-year-old sister use it often, and it has stood up to their use.  Even the 5-year-old is learning about the world.  Old-fashioned, I know, but we all learned what the world looks like from globes; it's more 3D and touchable than a map or computer.  Good quality at a fair price.";Great learning tool
42;59.0;3.0;5.0;2136;Came in packaged well and easy to assemble in less than a minute (with a Philips screwdriver).\n\nGives good information about latitudes (with highlighted equator), longitudes, political boundaries (slight inaccuracy here because disputed territories, I feel, should be marked so rather than making it a part of one country or the other) and goes to the extent of marking trade winds and their directions.\n\nMay not be sturdy as it is light (some weight on the base could have helped) and has a little overlap error where the map sheath/layer edges meet but, is very good value for money overall.\n\nI specially liked the physical features (mountains) shown by raised relief features.;Handy, usable, portable although slightly inaccurate and can tip easily
43;46.0;4.0;8.0;2292;I have always wanted to own a globe and I am very satisfied with this one.  It is exactly as I expected it to be and more.  My family will benefit greatly from this purchase.;Love it
44;38.0;4.0;11.0;2403;I bought this globe for my 5-year-old son. It is time for him to know the world around him.\nThis globe is almost perfect as educational tool, even you could feel the mountains.\nJust one issue bothers me: its weight. Just 5 lbs, maybe a little light, too easy to fall off the table when you have younger kid around.;wonderful piece
45;29.0;4.0;15.0;2429;I bought this globe for our children's homeschooling and we have already used it alot.  The colors and quality of the mapping is great.  The stand is a bit unsturdy, but overall it is still a good value for the price.;Nice globe for education needs
46;13.0;5.0;44.0;2441;I bought this as a gift for my 7 year old. I have to say that it was a great idea. He has been looking at in and recognizing\nDifferent countries. It's great for learning and easy to read. The stand is very stable. I would recommend this to anyone.;Great for learning
47;24.0;5.0;19.0;2504;This globe is a perfect learning tool for children.  My grandchildren were so happy to receive it as a gift. The customer service from the company was amazing!  I would order from them again\nRS;Excellent customer service
48;57.0;5.0;6.0;2613;Up-to-date borders between countries.  The base is too light and flimsy.  The northern and southern halves do not fit together exactly.  Still, good value for the modest price.;Explorer Globe evaluation
49;3.0;5.0;199.0;2815;My husband asked for a World globe for Christmas.  I started looking on the internet to learn about globes and found there were a vast array of globes with many prices according to the product.  I looked at Amazon and went through the various globes offered there, especially, the reviews and ratings of the different globes.  I chose the Explorer Globe because it was what I was looking for -  a basic learning globe with the simple qualities I thought a person would want in a globe that was for educating himself to World geography.  The price was right and it had raised relief with easy to read lettering. It also came with a sturdy stand.  I also liked the advice that this globe could be returned for an updated globe in the future.  When I received the globe is was what I expected.  I would recommend this globe to anyone who wants a good basic globe without all the frills that drive costs up.  My husband was thrilled!;Explorer Globe from Amazon
50;25.0;4.0;21.0;3143;This Globe serves it's purpose but I need a bigger one. I can't read the small print and the base should be weighted.;Excellent product
51;60.0;5.0;6.0;4019;"This colorful, 12"" diameter globe is well constructed, stands very securely on its stand; is not tippy.  It has very legible lettering, colorful political boundaries and is ""raised relief"" so you can tell where the mountain ranges are.  The children will enjoy using it, and so will Mom and Dad.  No excuses now for not knowing where world events are occurring!  The globe arrived in perfect condition, only 3-4 days after the order was placed.";Very pleased with this globe
52;19.0;3.0;38.0;4235;The globe itself is great. My daughter received this for Christmas and she just loves to find different places on her globe. The only problem is the stand. It is just screwed on at the bottom of the stand and we have to keep trying to tighten it up. They really should have made the stand better to with-stand children picking it up and actually using it. Other then the stand it is a great globe.;Stand is a disappointment...
53;15.0;3.0;50.0;4310;I bought this for my 5-year-old...the stand broke on the second day he had it.  The globe itself is nice, but it's disappointing that the stand isn't stronger;too flimsy
54;6.0;1.0;133.0;4380;I would not recommend this globe.  I bought this for my 3rd grader and on the first day of using it, the equator peeled off!!  I thought of keeping it anyway but decided to deal with the hassle and plan on returning it.  It also feels too flimsy and can fall over easily.;Broke first day
55;48.0;5.0;11.0;4400;We bought it to help the kids learn about the world. The raised mountains, and all the detail of the cities and boundaries, are really great. It'll work for them when they get older, too, because it's so very detailed. My husband and I really enjoy looking at it. It's a great value.;Great detail, kids love it
56;53.0;5.0;10.0;4403;This globe is beautiful and a great learning tool, too.  It's well made and easy to read.  We love it.;Beautiful Globe
57;45.0;5.0;12.0;4450;I purchased this as a birthday present for my 7 yr old granddaughter and found it to be of excellent quality.  Even the adults who saw it commented on it's detail and sturdy construction.  I was very pleased with my purchase.;Excellent Value
58;33.0;5.0;19.0;5405;It's amazing how much a child learns by having access.  We are an American family living in Germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives.;"12"" Raised Relief Explorer Globe"
59;5.0;5.0;169.0;5726;What a great, inexpensive globe.  It's fascinating to watch a child spin a globe - even if they don't seem like they are learning anything, at least they are getting a general idea of the immense size of our world!  Since getting this globe, my 5 year old son has learned about the continents and the oceans, found Australia on his own and pointed out that Antarctica is bigger than the USA.  It seems that the globe gets loose from it's stand somewhat easily, but it is easily tightened.  All in all, a great buy with terrific educational value.;There should be one in every house!

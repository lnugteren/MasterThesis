0;4.0;5.0;5.0;0;"I bought this for my daughter five years ago and it's still going strong. I have repeatedly recommended this lunch box to family, friends, colleagues, and strangers on the internet.\n\nMy daughter likes some of the school lunches but not all of them, so sometimes I would make her lunch to take to school. At first this was disappointing; there are only so many brown bag sandwiches that she'll happily eat during the week and I didn't like her having cold lunches at school. She doesn't have access to a refrigerator or microwave oven at school so that limited our options. For awhile I improvised using small Thermos-type containers to give her hot foods but this limited the types of hot foods I was able to give her since all those Thermos-type containers are vertical cylinders, not exactly conducive to things like spaghetti or hot sandwiches. Plus, her lunch bag got bulky with a collection of different sized containers, and everything had to be hand-washed because things like GladWare containers shouldn't be put in the dishwasher.\n\nSo I went looking for something better and I found this, and I can only say that I wish I found it earlier. The product description here on Amazon tells all of the gritty details so I won't waste time with that. Here's what you really want to know: YES, IT DEFINITELY KEEPS HOT FOODS HOT FOR HOURS AT A TIME! I make my daughter's lunch at 8am and she eats it at around 12:30pm and she has never once complained that her lunch wasn't hot enough. I learned that if I fill the main body (the ""jar"") with hot water while I prepare her lunch, it keeps her food hotter for a longer period of time. When all the food prep is complete and packaged I just empty the jar, dry it out, and load it up.\n\nOther things about this box that I adore...\n\n Yes, the lid is INTENDED to be a serving bowl! If you don't like eating from the containers or if you have to mix something before eating it then by all means flip the lid over and use it as a bowl.\n The carrying bag is sturdy and well constructed, and large enough to carry not only the lunch jar but a juice pack, juice box, or milk box fits nicely on top (along with a napkin or two). Slide the lariat closed and it stays nicely in place, safe and easily transportable with the rest of your lunch.\n It comes with a stainless steel spork, which was really nice. Unfortunately my daughter accidentally threw hers away when she was younger, but I found a nice titanium spork to take its place and she loves using that. The spork fits in a little ""pouch"" that's sewn inside of the carrying bag.\n It's pretty durable. My daughter's lunch box has a bunch of dents and such where she's tossed it around in her back pack, but the vacuum seal is still intact and it holds its temperature as good as it ever did.\n The lid and latching mechanism is especially durable. Because it's plastic I expected the latches to be the first things to fail, but after five years they still latch as tightly and positively as ever. Never once has the latch accidentally released, even after being dropped.\n It's dishwasher safe. Simply remove the soft seal and ventilation plug from the bottom-most container, and all of the pieces (containers, lids, jar lid, and spork) can go in the dishwasher. The container itself shouldn't be dishwashed lest the high temperature of the dishwasher disrupt the vacuum seal, but it's also easy enough to hand wash so it's not a big deal at all. The soft seals can be easily washed with a sponge and left to air dry, and they pop back into the lid with no effort. (And replacement seals are available, should yours get lost or damaged.) Even the carrying bag can go in the laundry!\n The carrying bag can be slung over a shoulder, carried upright by a handle, or packed in a school backpack.\n With four containers I can provide a nice assortment of the hot and cool foods my daughter loves. She often tells me that her friends are always offering to trade lunches with her because her lunches are so much nicer than the school lunches. :-)  We've established a system where the top container always has a dessert (cookies, brownie bites, etc), one down has a fruit (apples, peaches, grapes, strawberries, etc) and a vegetable (string beans, peas, cucumbers, pickles, etc), and the remaining two have the main entree (protein) and starch (rice, pasta, potatoes). Her favorite lunch is broiled salmon (lower-most container) with rice pilaf (one up), snap peas and strawberries (one up), and chocolate cupcake (top-most container), with a Capri Sun to drink.\n\nWilling trade-offs and caveats...\n\n It's heavier than a ""traditional"" lunch box owing to its stainless steel construction. My daughter willingly accepts the trade-off, however; she's more than happy to deal with the bit of extra weight in exchange for having a tasty hot lunch at school.\n The containers can't be rearranged; they must go in a specific order. This creates certain logistical issues. If you wanted to (for example) use only the large container for something hot and have cool things everywhere else, you can't. Whatever is under the large container will also be hot (or warm) and you can't put the large container on the bottom of the jar because the lid won't fit. (Unless you also remove one of the other containers; that would work.)\n\nI would totally buy this again and again without hesitation. I love it, my daughter loves it, her teachers have bought them for themselves, and some of her friends and schoolmates have gotten them as well. This may be the perfect student lunch box.";Maybe the perfect student lunch box.
1;48.0;5.0;5.0;187;I was so excited about this product, unfortunately is bent  will give it a try but so far I feel disappointed.\n\nUpdate...\nI had to change my rating from 3 to 5!!!\nCustomer service was amazing, they send me a replacement within 2 days and had no problems with that one...\nAfter having it for over 6 months I can say that it keeps food warm/hot, my husband loves it and will definitely recommend it.;Product damage
2;30.0;5.0;8.0;268;I think this is a high quality lunch jar. I opened it, and I felt the lunch jar is nice and light. The zippered carry bag is nice too. It protected the lunch jar, and easy to carry. We will using this to go out for a picnic. It's easy to carry warm food, so it help me solve the problem.;I like it.
3;34.0;3.0;9.0;372;The Bentobox actually worked well, as described. But the carrying bag that came with it was severely worn out after literally two uses!!! That's the main reason that I'm not rating it 4-star.;Not sure why they would supply the rather expensive lunch jar with carrying bag of so bad quality ...
4;22.0;1.0;14.0;377;I used this insulated lunch box when I was in school.  This company has been around for long long time with great reputation of providing quality appliances.  My old one insulated really well and didn't leak when I had a soup, too.  Now that my daughter started her years in college, I thought I get this for her so she can keep the food warm during the cold winter.  Very dissapointing.  The soup leaks and any kind of tiny amount of liquid leaks.  Also, the food doesn't stay warm long enough.  The quality of Zojirushi insulated lunch boxes are not there anymore.  I used to trust anything with a brand Zojirushi.  Not anymore.  Now, it's just non functional, over priced lunch box.;Dissapointing
5;41.0;5.0;10.0;645;First day using this and I am loving it. I do not have access to a microwave at work and cole cuts just weren't getting the job done anymore. Today I brought a hearty vegetable soup, grilled teriyaki skirt steak, roasted potatoes, steamed broccoli, and sauted spinach and mushrooms! This thing kept everything at an enjoyable temperature! I packed my lunch at 3pm and am now eating it at 11pm!;Loving it so far!
6;76.0;5.0;6.0;658;"This product is perfection! My husband really needed a lunch container and we're glad we went with this one. I can easily pack a full-course meal with this, including soup! It's really a great option for anyone who works in a factory; this thing can take a beating. My husband works 12-16 hour shifts overnight in a hot factory (which stays plenty hot overnight, despite it being 50 degrees outside). If I pack it with cool food, it stays cool. If I pack it with hot food, it stays pretty hot. I'd say it works well for at least 4~5 hours, because that's usually when my husband gets his lunch break.\n\nPros:\n-Really great compartments and sizing. I can fit 2 nice-sized chicken breasts, a ton of rice with veggies, miso/other soups, and fruits in them.\n-Great insulation!\n-Takes a bruising; my husband has dropped it more than once and it's perfectly fine, not even a ding on the thing.\n\nCons:\n-It is NOT for a kid. I have no clue why some people complain that it's too small, but trust me: this thing is not for your 5 year old. This packs plenty of food for a hard-working, 5'10, 180lb. man so I see no reason for anyone to complain about it. That said, it may be a con for some people who are looking for something for their kids (they sell a mini version of this here on Amazon, just look it up).\n-The soup container can be reeeeeally hard to open! It's easy to overtighten it, so be careful.\n-It's pretty heavy for a lunch container. Might be a little annoying for some people, plus it's kind of tall so it might not fit well in a crowded office refrigerator if you opt for cool food and choose to put it in one.\n\nOverall, it's great! It's worked 100% perfectly for us and we really dig it. <3";Awesome, Awesome! We love it! Great for Factory Workers
7;13.0;3.0;25.0;711;Just opened the package in the past hour, while the overall construction seems impressive, I do have concerns over the history of the product that I purchased. My understanding is that I was purchasing a new product. Upon opening the canister and pulling out each bowl, I noticed considerable scratches on the lids and even waterspots on at least one lid. Upon opening the lids, I noticed a quaint smell of food in at least two of the bowls. I plan to keep anyways and wash it thoroughly, however this is a poor reflection on product sales.;Zojirushi Bento
8;5.0;5.0;84.0;728;This is the second Zojirushi I have bought. It is so worth the money. The food stays hot or cold, and the containers are easy and fun to pack. This is outstanding quality. I use silicon baking cups as dividers.;Outstanding Quality, well worth the money.
9;10.0;4.0;32.0;740;The jar is good quality, just some comments based on my Chinese eating habits:  The size looks good in the videos but when I was holding them I felt them too small. I'm not good at visualizing so it's my fault. The effective volume of the main bowl is smaller than it looks with the effective depth shorter than my little finger. The soup bowl is also mini size for many Chinese people. For Chinese who normally prepare one main-bowl sized fried dish and one main-bowl sized steamed rice, this jar only has one main bowl sized container. I don't see many critical comments on the size so it is possibly because my husband eats a lot. >v<;Small volume
10;51.0;4.0;10.0;786;Works perfect it keeps the food hot for up to 6h but food needs to be heat up on stove in a pot or pan not in de microwave the only down side is that the plastic containers got stain on the first time used and can't get the stain away;Good product
11;9.0;5.0;38.0;840;I bought Mr Bento for my husband and he has been using it since Sept. 2015. He works outdoor so this comes handy for the sole purpose of keeping the food warm.  I don't mix cold and hot food together so this review is purely on hot food. Also, keep in mind we started to use it when the summer was really hot till now.\n\nTips -\n\n1. To keep the food  warm up to 6 hours or so, pour boiling water into Mr Bento, minus the containers, cover and leave it for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, pour the water out and wipe it.\n2. Heat up the containers with food inside in microwave. The containers are microwave safe. Leave the lid out. Occasionally I forgot and takes me awhile to get them open.\n3. Stack the very hot containers into Mr Bento\n\nPros - The containers may look small but they are surprisingly can feed reasonably big man.\n\nCons- They are not leaked proof, especially the big container. You still can get away with soup or curry in the bottom container. Just make sure it's really tight.\n\nOverall, I think it's a good buy.;I love it!!!
12;66.0;5.0;8.0;905;It s good one;Five Stars
13;101.0;2.0;5.0;1076;"I personally do not like this set up. Although I should have read more into the Bento style lunch design. I would not recommend putting any meats in this. Reason is, it will retain the smell even after washing it thoroughly. Again, I probably did not use it as intended (bento meals). I have tried doing chicken and rice. And also tried pasta which stained the plastic orange from the tomato sauce. Washed every piece and dried best I can. Being so compact and small portions and on top of not working out as I imagined, I put it away. Few weeks later I tried it again, and upon opening one of the containers, there was mold! Now it definitely is being put out of commission.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to eat big meals, this is not for you. You better follow the Bento meal design or else this will disappoint you. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS DRY BEFORE STORING.";Designed for Bento style meals and only Bento style meals.
14;102.0;5.0;5.0;1086;This is the 3rd Mr. Bento I have purchased this school year. I have 3 boys who were coming home after school starving from not getting enough to eat at school. One of my older boys was sick one day so the youngest took his jar to school. Now he wants his own. So that is the reason for this purchase. I have asked the kids multiple times if their food stays hot or just warm. I boil a pan of water and fill them up to heat the two bottom bowls before filling them with food. It keeps it hot not just warm. In fact one of my boys didn't eat his bottom bowl one day cause he was full and when I went to wash it at 9pm it was still warm enough to eat. I had filled them at 7am. My boys are big eaters and this gives them plenty for lunch as school. My high schooler loves his jar and his friend constantly want to trade food with him since he is taking home cooked meals. The little backpack they come with are perfect for the boys hauling their lunch around, the spork is stainless steel and heavy,quality. They wash easy and quickly by hand. I have sent just about anything we have had for leftovers from supper with them and they are much happier. That makes us all happy.;Best Investment I made this year
15;54.0;1.0;11.0;1188;Of the 4 bowls, 2 can be used to keep food warm (1 is spill proof) and the other 2 can be used to keep food lukewarm.  That works.  However, after a few months' of use, the largest bowl became too difficult to open.  Last week, one of the guys in the office had to hold it for me, while I turned the lid.  Then, even after I was able to turn it, he still had to use a metal wedge to open the lid because of the vacuum seal.  Gads.  Couldn't they have made it easier to open for Pete's sake?  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product as there is no way to release the vacuum created when the food cools.  Very poorly designed.;Took two people to open - one to hold the bowl, one to turn the lid
16;114.0;5.0;5.0;1270;"Simply awesome. Haven't used it to keep food hot, but it certainly keeps your food cool if not cold. Great way to eat healthy. Toss in your dinner leftovers and no fussing around the next morning trying to decide what to bring for lunch. No processed lunchmeats, chips or junk like that. Usually I fill the large container with the locking lid with romaine lettuce, packed pretty tight, then I cut up cucumber, tomato, radish, whatever and put them in two silicone muffin cups, wrapped in plastic wrap. Believe me, it will fit (see my week's worth of salad suggestion below). In the large container with the press down lid, I put leftover entree from the night before. In the smaller container with the press down lid, I put mixed nuts and a box of raisins mixed together. In the soup container, I put plain yogurt with frozen blueberries. I put all of the containers in the cylnder, then I take a 1 (or 1.5 oz? not sure about the size) tupperware container with some salad dressing. With a small circle of masking tape, I tape the dressing to the lid of the cylinder, then put everything in the fridge. The next morning, everything goes into the the bag and I stick it in my backpack with my laptop. Even the dressing taped to the top of the lid fits in the included Zojirushi sack. At lunchtime, everything is still cool and I use a plate and bowl at my desk at work. All of my co-workers are jealous of this contraption and are always interested in what I bring. My wife has the same reaction at work with her three container version.\n\nWeek's worth of salad tip: Rip up enough lettuce for the week, wash then spin in a salad spinner. Dump it all in a bowl, put a ""select-a-size papertowel square on top of the salad. Then cover the bowl with saran wrap. Every evening when preparing the next day's lunch, you will see the salad is fresh. Just fluff it with your hands so the lettuce moves around, change the paper towel in the bowl and cover with the saran wrap (remove any condensation that accumulated on the inside of the saran wrap with the old paper towel). You will see that the lettuce stays crisp all the way to Friday). Also, separate the veggies into the silicone muffin cups and wrap as directed below, otherwise the veggies will result in soggy veggies.";Simply FANTASTIC.
17;81.0;1.0;8.0;1367;I really liked the idea of this item. But the top lid is required to latch to keep eveything inside and sealed.  The clips are cheap plastic and after only 3 uses, one latch on our broke and the lid won't stay on.  Could not return or replace item after 30 days.  Too expensive to only work a few times.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  and i bought two of them dangit.;Would give 0 stars if could. Junky latch broke after 3 uses.
18;75.0;1.0;9.0;1436;Quality was not as expected. The bowls inside warped so badly the lids no longer seal after like a weeks worth of use. We followed all the care instructions too, handwashing only. But dang, I got it for a Christmas gift and now I feel bad because it's so crappy. Don't waste your money on this because of the brand name. Not worth it! Inside containers are like cheap Tupperware at best.;Expected better
19;94.0;1.0;7.0;1439;After having this Lunch jar for two days I discovered one of the containers leaks. I was surprised and I contacted Customer service at Zojirushi .  They informed me via email, and via phone, the container in question was not designed to be leak proof.  Not only that, but the two additional containers in the set of 4  were also not designed to be leak proof.  Wait it gets better.  The soup bowl is designed to release stem enabling water to escape and collect in the Stainless steel container.  The stainless steel container does not have a seal allowing the accumulated water to escape.\n\nIn an email from customer support I was told to just make sure the Jar never sits on its side and leaking shouldn't be an issue.  To think I bought a lunch box that leaks by design.\n\nIf you buy this know it leaks, and nothing can be done to prevent it.;Do not buy this lunch box, it leaks by design. Please read.
20;83.0;1.0;8.0;1459;We (my daughter, 12 year-old) were shocking to see the new Zojirushi Bento lunch jar received, with each items had food left overs and traces of food not cleaned. We order this item as New, (even a used one should be cleaned before you ship out for your buyer). I do not understand what the seller was missing....I would like to give no star for this sale, but it only gave me a choice of 1 star as the lowest.;Shocking to see food leftovers from the new product ordered
21;87.0;5.0;8.0;1539;When I started a new job and found I had no place to heat or reheat food I began to look for an alternative. The Mr. Bento has filled the bill perfectly. I am a 225lb male industrial worker. I was concerned that the size of the containers might be too small. I am happy to report that this is not the case. I pack soup or rice in the bottom bowl (hot) and stir fry or pasta dishes in the second (also hot). I always make a salad in the large top container (room temperature and no problems with heat from the bottom) and I use the top container for nuts, fruit, carrot sticks, cheese and crackers, etc. I usually take a piece of fruit for a snack and find a banana easily fits in the bag along with the containers. The spork is also great for soup/salad/pasta etc. It is four hours from the time I pack the bag until my lunch break. The food stays hot and the portability is ideal. I never write reviews but felt that this product deserved one. It has transformed my lunch into a proper meal every day with great results. Thanks for a great product and a life changing purchase. Definitely worth the money.;The Best Luch 'Box' I Have Owned - 50 yr old 225lb male industrial worker - Highly Recommended!
22;24.0;1.0;28.0;1562;I am a long time Zojirushi fan and was always pleased with the quality of their products. I have purchased 2 breadmakers, 6 Classic bentos, numerous rice cookers, insulated thermos, and now a Mr. Bento. I am giving a 1 star rating mainly because of the poor customer service I received. The Mr. Bento rice container with lid was very difficult to open when I got it. All of the other bento rice containers for the Classic Bentos I purchased were easy to open but this one was so tight that I could barely open it. I used it a couple times to see if would loosen but it didn't, so I contacted the customer service (Chico) and asked if I could exchange the rice bowl and lid. This was about a month after I purchased it. Chico would not exchange them and said I would have to purchase another rice bowl and lid. I even sent him copies of all of my Zojirushi purchases to prove that I was a loyal customer but all Chico could do was offer me the price list. Let me say I am so disappointed with Zojirushi that I am reluctant to purchase another Zojirushi product again.;Poorest customer service
23;123.0;5.0;5.0;1596;So I started a diet, and decided it was best nutritionally as well as cheaper to take my lunch every day so I started looking for a lunchbox. I came across this and was immediately put off by the price because to me, who in their right mind would spend $50+ on a lunchbox??? Well i read the reviews, and I looked at some pictures, and I was convinced enough to give it a try...especially after reading about their customer service!\nI bought it a month or two ago but waited to review it because I really wanted to try a bunch of different lunches before I made the review. I must say, it really does keep your hot food very warm...it's not hot as if you had just cooked it but it's very warm and to me, it's the perfect temperature to eat your food at. It also helps with portion control. I tend to put the 'entree' part of my meal in the bottom vented canister, and then the vegetables or rice in the larger insulated one. These are some of the dishes I have brought to work in my Mr. Bento:\n\nPaneer Tikka Masala Curry: The curry in the bottom, then the rice, then I cut naan bread into smaller pieces, wrapped them in foil and left them in an upper container, and then a final container of fruit. The Curry was nice and hot and the rice too, the bread obviously wasn't but that's ok, and the fruit was a little warmer than I would have liked, but hey, you can't have it all.\n\nGrilled Chicken with Mixed Veggies: I grill up a chicken cutlet in the morning, cut it in half and put it in the bottom container and then I either grill some veggies or sautee them and throw them in the larger container. I don't actually always need or use the top two, but I tend to fill them with fruit.\n\nCreamy Avocado sauce with Spaghetti and steamed broccoli: I prepared some whole wheat spaghetti with a creamy avocado sauce, threw that in the bottom container (portion control! it's smaller) and then filled the second insulated container full with steamed broccoli. Had it at lunch, nice and warm.\n\nI've prepared other things, but these are the most frequent dishes I bring with me to work. I must say the Tikka Masala was my favorite because I kept the curry in the bottom, the rice in the second one (which is larger) then I dumped the curry in with the rice so they were side by side and ate it like that. It was great.\n\nI also love the metal spork it comes with! I don't actually use it but one day I will! The bag is also very convenient, I just throw it over my shoulder and go to work. This lunchbox is truly awesome and the meal combinations are endless. Just know that you really can't keep 2 canisters hot and 2 cold...what I do is I took 2 pieces of cardboard, cut them to the same diameter of the Mr. Bento, then covered it with tinfoil and it does a pretty decent job of preventing too much heat from traveling above the insulated containers into the non-insulated containers. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. I haven't tried to bring anything cold in the insulated containers yet, but if I ever do, I will surely update this review to reflect that.\n\nYou can't go wrong with the Mr. Bento... it's sturdy, easy, and convenient. You should definitely buy it.;"Best money I've ever spent on a ""lunchbox""!"
24;15.0;1.0;36.0;1601;I loved this Bento when I first bought it.  But one year later, the snaps that hold the lid in place have just degraded to the point where they don't snap anymore and that lid doesn't stay on.  I contacted Zojirushi and they were completely unhelpful and have no replacement lid they can send or that I can buy.  And they kept suggesting that I broke the item myself (rather than admitting that the plastic they use is just terrible quality).  Given the brand name and the price, I would have expected to be able to use this for more than just one year.  Very disappointing.;Doesn't hold up
25;125.0;5.0;5.0;1614;"I received Mr. Bento a week ago and have been using it daily.  I love Mr. Bento!  The product info says that it will keep hot foods hot for 6 hours.  I don't usually get to eat my lunch until after 6 or 7 hours, and the two lower containers are still warm.  I'm sure my soup would still be hot if I could get to it a little quicker.  I've noticed that I look forward to preparing and packing my lunch now, and I've been eating much healthier over the past week.  I've had several coworkers ask about Mr. Bento because it's ""so cute!""  They're also jealous of the fact that they have cold, sad sandwiches, and I have delicious four course meals.\n\nWhen I initially got Mr. Bento, I thought the containers looked pretty small, but they really aren't.  They hold a lot more than you'd expect.  Another plus is that the insulated carrying bag has external pockets, so I can throw in some crackers or a granola bar if I need a little more.  The spork can be awkward for some foods, but a pair of chopsticks easily fit into the same exterior pockets as the granola bar.\n\nOverall, this has revolutionized my lunch.  I'm eating healthier foods, I'm avoiding the drive-thru, and I'm saving money.  Mr. Bento is a little pricey up-front, but pays for itself in 1-2 weeks (depending upon where you were buying your lunch before).  I don't know if I could live without my Mr. Bento at this point.";Packing lunch is my daily Zen
26;33.0;1.0;19.0;1633;I put piping hot food in the bottom containers in the morning and by lunch it's barely warm. The main container's lid gets VERY STUCK very often. Soup container is tiny. Overall a very mediocre item for way too expensive. I bought a 16 oz Thermos food jar for only 15$ for my husband and if for some reason he doesn't eat his lunch that day, the food is still HOT by the end of the day. Too bad Thermos doesn't make any lunch box with separate containers. This product was a waste of money. I wouldn't have paid more than 20$ for this.;Way overpriced
27;65.0;4.0;11.0;1667;"Okay, people. Seems like there has been a lot of folks giving this a low rating because they didn't know ""exactly"" what they were getting when they bought the Mr. Bento. Not the product's fault because someone misread or didn't read the description or even the instructions on how to use it properly. So maybe this can help clarify as to what the Mr. Bento can and cannot do before someone buys it.\n\nThe bowls are all BPA free plastic. Only the outside of the jar is stainless steel. The description is a bit misleading. I don't believe any of the Zojirushi lunch jars have stainless steel lunch bowls. Wouldn't be microwavable if they were.\n\nThe containers are NOT leakproof with the exception of the soup container and the lids cannot go into the microwave. These were the reasons why I only gave it a 4-star rating. It would be nice if Zoji could come up with a model that does have all leakproof bowls. We can work around the no lid in the microwave aspect.\n\nI've tested all 4 bowls and although the soup container is leakproof, wouldn't recommend letting it roll around loose or play catch with it (just to be on the safe side). Granted I wouldn't do that with any of my other leakproof containers either.\n\nThis is either a hot or cold container. That means you can either keep a hot meal warm or a cold meal cold. Not both together. Some common sense here folks. Put a hot item next to a cold item in an insulated container will not keep each item hot or cold. The review that said it allows for two temperatures in the same container is technically true but he doesn't say that it will keep them the same temperature as when they went in. Sorry, there is just no way around the physics. So if you want a hot AND cold meal but no way of heating up the container(s), this will not work for you. There are other ways to do this, one suggestion I've added at the end of this review.\n\nMy husband's lunches usually contain some part that needs to be heated up. So I use Mr. Bento mainly as a cold jar. Works great because I no longer have to put an ice pack in his lunch bag to keep his lunch cold. What I do is put together his lunch the night before. Put all the containers into the jar and everything goes into the fridge. In the morning, pull it out, into the bag and off he goes! Fruit salad and side salad stay cold and he just heats up the main dish and/or soup.\n\nLunches vary. Small side container has some kind of small side, pickles, veggie salad stuff. This is a very small container, holds only 7 oz. That's just less than a cup.\n\nLarge side container is not a whole lot bigger than the small side, just a bit more than a cup. Holds usually a fruit salad. Won't hold a lot of whole larger type of fruit, such as strawberries or large grapes. I just cut the larger pieces to fit more in.\n\nThe main bowl (NOT LEAKPROOF!) contains some kind of protein, sometimes steamed white rice, depending on the meal. This is the largest container of the four and holds 15 oz, just shy of 2 cups. Don't expect this to hold a steak and be used with a steak knife and fork. Not how it was meant to be used. Nor is it meant to fit a whole sandwich in it. It's a Mr. Bento, not a Mr. Sandwich container.\n\nThe soup bowl (leakproof) doesn't always get used but I've put rice porridge and an additional salad or more rice if I need to use the main bowl for the protein. This holds 9 oz, just a bit over a cup.\n\nHere are the capacities of the containers for reference listed in the order they come out of the jar (top-down):\n\nSmall Side Bowl 7 oz\nLarge Side Bowl 10 oz.\nMain Bowl 15 oz\nSoup Bowl 9 oz.\n\nYes, this is not for anyone who need larger meals. Zorijushi does have bento jars with larger bowls. The Classic Bento has a main bowl that holds 20 oz, and a side bowl that holds 14 oz, with the same size soup bowl. If you need an even larger main bowl, the Classic Stainless Lunch Jar will hold up to 27 oz. almost 3.5 cups.\n\nFor someone who want both hot and cold items together, one suggestion is using Zoji's single food jar for hot, which holds a good 25 oz. Then use one of the smaller bentos (like Ms. Bento) for the cold items. Yes, more containers to lug around but you might be able to fit both jars in a larger insulated bag.\n\nCheck out Zojirushi's website for more details on all their lunch jars. You can even do a compare on the different models. That's what I did before buying this model.";Great Lunch Jar - for those who know how to use it properly
28;39.0;1.0;17.0;1715;The following is why I only gave Mr. Bento one star:\n\n1. Watermelon dyed the plastic- not sure if it'll wash out. Strange part about this is that I had curry a few times and it didn't stain the plastic...\n\n2. Extremely heavy. I thought this would be great for keeping in my messenger bag. WRONG. My bag + Mr. Bento makes my back hurt.\n\n3. Containers too small for many things. Although all of the containers combined give you room for plenty of food, it's awkward to fit many things like fruit. If your like me and like to bring lots of fruit for snacks and as part of your lunch, you'll find the containers too small.  I know this is designed to a traditional Japanese type lunch, but it frustrates me that I have to use a different container for salads. I was hoping this would be the one stop shop and I could get rid of some of my plastic container clutter.\n\n4. Containers not leak proof. Watermelon juice ended up covering all containers inside and the main compartment. Makes it very annoying to deal with at work. Same with soup or sauce\n\n5. Lids stick. The lids get so stuck that I have to pry them off and if I'm not being careful this causes food to splatter on me.;Huge Disappointment

I tried to return it because it was so poor and they would not take it back. The cups are tiny and it does not hold temperature like advertised.  I really would not suggest investing your money on this. I GAVE it away after a few complete failed attempts at making it work. The spork is by far the best part.;Do not buy this item unless.....

31;20.0;1.0;32.0;1804;We bought the Mr Bento less than 6 months ago and the main insulated compartment has become impossible to open.  The lid sticks so tightly that you can't lift it off.  My husband actually had to pry it open with a knife this morning, and even then it took him almost 10 min to accomplish it.  We send this lunchbox with my son to school so this renders the whole product rather useless for us.\n\nI emailed customer support a few days ago and asked if I could get a replacement for the main container shipped to me.  They sent me the link where i can buy replacement parts and refuse to replace it for me.  Considering we've had this for less than 6 months and that this is a product defect. I shoudn't have to pay for a replacement container.\n\nSince my son can't use this Mr Bento anymore, I'm going to look into another company's products who stand behind their products a little bit more.\n\nHorrible customer service, buyer beware!;Horrible customer service
32;71.0;4.0;11.0;1868;"At the time of this review, I've just finished my first lunch from it.  If I feel so inclined I'll certainly add more notes to this in the future after it's gotten some heavier use.  So far, though, so good.\n\nI've been losing some weight and I want to keep that up.  I also found out recently that for work I'm going to be moving from the building that I'm in, which has a cafeteria, into a different building without a cafeteria.  I'll be needing to bring my lunch then, it's far too costly to keep going out to lunch every day.  That all said, this product has 2 purposes for me:  Portion Control for weight loss and eating healthier, and Money Savings since it's so much cheaper to make your own food than to go out and eat (not to mention gas/parking issues as well).\n\nI received the container on Monday (Dec. 31, 2012) and washed it yesterday to use today (Jan 2, 2013).  Last night before bed, I put the following items into it (Bowls are from bottom up):\n\n  1) Bottom (Soup, 9oz) bowl - a slice of smoked pork loin that I made Monday.\n  2) Lower Middle (Main, 15oz) bowl - bean soup that I also made on Monday.\n  3) Upper Middle (Large Side, 10oz) bowl - some Chex Mix.\n  4) Top (Small Side, 7oz) bowl - some smoked apple slices that I made on Monday.\n\nIf you actually read that above, you will see my mistake.  The bottom bowl is meant for soup, not the top one.  I read everything too, just didn't retain and last night I was hungry for soup so I wanted it in the biggest bowl.  What's good to know is that although there was some spillage there was only very little.  I carried it upright for the most part but when I got into my car to come to work I threw my laptop and the lunch bag into the back seat so it was on its side for about 45 minutes in the car.  The gravy in the bottom bowl did not spill even a drop though, so it looks like that bowl will be great for liquids.  Tomorrow, I'll switch the containers that the loin and the soup are in, there's too much food anyway!\n\n--Heat Retention:\nPlease see the notes below that I've taken straight from the Zojirushi web site (but not on the Amazon page) on this product:\n\n  Heat Retention After 6 Hours* 153F\n  Cold Retention After 6 Hours** 50F\n  Color Lemon Yellow, Apple Red, Gun Metalic, Silver\n\n  *Rating is based on water at a starting temperature of 203F (95C)\n  at a room temperature of 68F (20C)\n  **Rating is based on water at a starting temperature of 40F (4C)\n  at a room temperature of 68F (20C)\n\nFirst, I'm assuming they used the bottom (soup) bowl for this.  It definitely had the best heat retention for the 2 bowls that it's intended for (soup and large main bowl).  My pork loin was still really warm and the soup was warn but not as much.  After I packed the bowls, I put them into the refrigerator (without the main container).  This morning I took the tops off of the hot food bowls and put them into the microwave for a couple of minutes, making them hot but nothing crazy like the 203F they listed above.  I put the lids back on and put everything into place into the container and left shortly therearfter.  That was about 7:10 AM. I got to work and left the lunch container on my desk (not in the refrigerator) until about 11:30 AM when I got hungry.  so 4 hours, 20 minutes.  I'd say all together the soup bowl kept the pork loin about 80% as hot as it started, and the larger bowl kept my soup about 60% as hot as it was.  For me, this is good - I don't like food to be super hot anyway, and like I said I didn't start off with it at some crazy heat anyway.\n\nAs far as the top two containers, they were both pretty much room temperature inside as advertised.  As they were snacks I wasn't trying to keep them cold.  Note that only the bottom 2 containers will retain heat or cold levels at all - the top two are not insulated and are intended to maintain temperatures that are found outside of the unit.  I've read that heating or cooling the lids ahead of time also help to retain temperatures you desire.  I'll try that myself, too.\n\n--Size/Weight:\nSo I've seen some reviews where people are complaining that the size of the thing is too large and others that say it's too small.  Some say it's not heavy, others say it is way too heavy.  Obviously this is going to be a perosnal choice and I'd rather give you some details and let you make your decision based on those, not other people's opinions that may not be your own.\n\nFrom the Zojirushi web site:\nDimensions (W x D x H) 6 x 5-3/8 x 8-3/4 inches\n\nThe width of 6"" is at its widest point, which includes the clips on the sides.  The depth of 5-3/8"" must be the smaller area without the clips but that's not correct.  The width of the tube itself, the top and the bottom is just 5"".  The 8-3/4"" height is not correct  - it's actually 8-1/2"" tall - not a big deal, I know, but I'm trying to be literal here.  I have no idea why their dimensions are off but I'm sure my ruler isn't wrong.\n\nTo me the size of the thing is perfectly fine - but I knew how big it would be based on reading reviews and seeing the dimensions listed.  I don't mind that it's acutally slightly smaller than advertised, either.  The listed weight is 2.07 pounds including the bag per their web site.  I didn't weigh it but sure, that seems right.  With the food that I put in it, I'd think I added less than 1/2 a pound.  So...2.5 pounds total for lunch?  I don't see that as a problem whatsoever, plus the bag is very handy and has a long strap which has no problems carrying the weight.\n\n--Cleaning:\nThis is one of my main concerns with this, and I'll probably just have to deal with it.  I cleaned out the soup bowl a little while ago (after I started writing this review, in fact) and it washed out very nicely and easy.  The soup was dark, the bowl was white, and there's no stains or any leftover residue that was hard to clean up.  I'll take care of the others when I get home...but that's where the concern is.  Normally with any lunch I may bring it's in separate containers from Rubbermade or ziplock or whatever.  Those can go in the dishwasher....so clean up is a breeze.  This stuff isn't supposed to go into the dishwasher though, which is the one thing I don't like.  Since I only have one of these I wouldn't be washing it in the dishwasher every day anyway - but I won't be bringing this to work every single day and just because it's a little more sanitary I do like to wash things in the dishwasher now and then to make sure it's very clean (for instance, I bring my coffee cup from work home once or twice a month just to run it through a cycle).  I don't have those options with this....which is probably why I have 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nI really don't understand how something can be microwave safe, holding starting temps just over 200F per their own web site, can't handle a dishwasher.  Now a quick online search of dishwasher temperatures show that they are generally in the 140-150 range, but that dishwashers with heating elements can bring it up quite a bit higher if you have them dry the dishes themselves.  I don't do this because it really doesn't seem to actually dry the dishes anyway - you'd think a warning like ""Dishwasher safe, top rack and air dry only"" would suffice...but I have to wonder if there are other reasons.  Another reviewer on this product here said they lost the valve on the soup bowl because they always wash the parts in the dishwasher.....so I'd think it DOES work fine in the dishwasher but don't take that statement as the truth from me please.  I may try it out myself just to see, and if I do I'll add a comment to this review later to let you know how it went.\n\n--Overall Quality\nThis is a big plus.  This unit seems to be made extremely well, the clips are strong and the lids stay on tight.  The large main container and soup bowl lids were a little tough to take off but I did screw them on tight.\n\nThe spoon, probably easily looked over, is actually pretty nice for an ""addon"" or ""value-added"" item.  I like that it comes with a hard plastic cover that snaps on, plus there's a place for it inside of the bag as well which helps it to stay in place.  The bag comes with it, another very nice feature that I really don't think I'd expect them to put with it.  Honestly I'd expect most companies to add it as something you can buy for another $10 or whatever.  So kudos to Zojirushi for these two things.\n\n--Final Words\nI really do like this lunch container so far and the only issue I have with it as I stated above is that the containers aren't dishwasher safe (at least they say they aren't) but they're microwave safe.  Just doesn't make sense.  Othewise it's a fantastic product and I recommend it to anyone who thinks they'd use it (that is, after all, the key - right?).\n\n-D";Great Lunch Container, Very Few Drawbacks

The concept is obviously sound (with centuries of testing!), although we were concerned by the apparent flimsy security of the insulated tub ""rings"" on one container (the little rubber inserts for insulation). The center ""plug"" fell out after a few weeks use, and would not stay securely inserted thereafter. We called the manufacturer, and were curtly advised that there was NO WARRANTY on the product whatsoever! We were invited to purchase replacement plugs for nearly $3 each, plus $3 shipping, which we did, begrudgingly. We filled out a customer service feedback form online, hoping that perhaps the lack of service provided by phone was an anomaly (It's not so much the additional expenditure that bothers me, as the company's complete unwillingness to stand behind their product. That's disconcerting, to say the least).\n\nUPDATE: The company just called and threatened legal action based on the above review...!? Way to go, customer service!

Simply put, it works. the bottom container (meant for liquids) does not leak liquids, works great. The second bowl - bigger than it looks, big insulated lid keeps everything underneath nice and toasty. NO it does not keep stuff ""scald-the-skin-off-your-mouth-hot"", but it does keep it pleasantly warm.

These are not easily packed in a lunch box and his school has no microwave available for students to heat up their food.  The Z-Box (sorry Zojirushi just doesn't flow off my language challenged tongue) provided us with a solution.  We fill the main jar with boiling water to pre-heat it as the instructions suggest and then fill the bottom food container (the one intended for soup) with boiling water which we leave in it. Then we fill the large food container with hot spaghetti and the medium container with pieces of hot crispy bacon (we gave up on pizza).  5 hours later, when our son has lunch, it is still warm (not hot!).  I haven't had the courage to put any of the containers in the dishwasher so I can't report on their ""dishwasher safe"" status.  The slot on the inside is convenient for securing the disposable plastic spoon and fork we send each day.  The only two downsides are: 1. It's not easy to pack in a school backpack.  2.

40;142.0;2.0;5.0;2398;I was really excited to get my Mr. Bento.  I read the directions and packed my first lunch.  In the soup bowl I put in a toasted and buttered bagel. I had to cut it into sections to get it in.  No problem. Then I put a stuffed green pepper in the main bowl.  I put in a napkin next then a side bowl with a cut up apple. Lastly raisins and almonds in the top bowl.  When it was coffee time first thing I went for was the bagel in the soup bowl.  There was liquid all over everything.  It was from the stuffed pepper.  Now this pepper was not sloppy by any means.  It was like the liquid evaporated out all over.  I think if I had rice with a vegetable in it, it would do the same thing.  The size was good (I think the Ms. Bento would be too small for me.  The carrying bag is useless.  You could not get anything else inside.  The outside pocket would only be good for a napkin or something skinny and not breakable.  Also the strap is very cheap and slips off your shoulder when carrying.

The lid is not a press-and-seal or even screw-on, but rather you turn it 1/8th of a turn to lock it down. If you never plan on having soup as your main dish (rather than the very small soup side-dish bowl) or even extra-juicy steak in the main dish then it will probably work fine.

Ultimately, I was not at all happy with my purchase due to the following factors:\n\n1) Did not keep food at the adequate temperatures (3 hours later, my soup was cold, and any other items were as well). I followed the instructions and didn't mix foods of different temperatures, and even when using all-cold items, i can't say everything stayed the correct temperature.\n\n2) Lids would stick. This is especially true for the soup lid, that had a small latch under the center part - this latch would detach and it would become close to impossible to open the lid.\n\n3) Stains / Smells - Being plastic, food stains and smells stuck to the bowls. I assumed this would happen so i wasn't surprised - however, this happened after the FIRST use, even when i washed out everything at the end of the day.\n\nIn the end, the only thing i kept from the set was the Spork.\nCompletely and utterly disappointed.;Very Disappointing
43;134.0;1.0;6.0;2749;Beware!  Before you buy this please realize you may end up hating this bento box too.  I've had this bento box for about two years now.  I've used it less than 10 times during this timeframe and let me say what I think is good and bad about this:\n\nThe Good:\n-It's interesting and fun\n-I love the brand, I have two of their ricecookers and they always cook perfect rice\n-I find it easy to carry around\n\nThe Bad:\n-I can no longer open the containers, rendering the whole contraption useless!  I am physically unable to twist the lids off the containers!  And I'm not a frail woman in my 80's or a child of 6!  Okay, so I don't work out regularly and have giant hands that can grip this container lid but I didn't realize that was a requirement to own this bento box. These container lids have to be at least three times as stubborn as a pasta sauce jar lid.\n-I find it hard to fit most lunches in here, so a few months ago purchased another lunch bag to put my tupperware in that I now use every day\n\nI'm not sure if it keeps food hot as I have a microwave and fridge at work and never needed to test it.\n\nSo cute yes but now I have a broken lunchbox taking up space in my kitchen.;I hate this bento box!
44;47.0;1.0;20.0;2882;"We had purchased the Ms. Bento for our toddler's day care lunch--which is a perfect size for a tot, not a ""Ms"", unless you're on a diet. So we thought of getting this one for my husband to take food to work.\nPeople complain it is bulky, and it is--but what can you expect if you want to bring rice, soup, an ""entree"" and some dessert? The top-to-bottom hot-to-cold design notion is very good if you want a varied lunch, rather than just a sandwich or salad.\nHowever, it is so cheaply made, that on week one the ""thermal"" lid that covers the ""rice"" container (where we usually put the actual entree) popped. By ""popped"" I do not mean it came off the container. The lid itself is a brittle plastic shell holding a disk of plain styrofoam (this is your insulation), and the top of the plastic cylinder came right off during washing (it didn't even take a hit), letting the styrofoam out. We have been unable to fit it back with glue or any other means. So now, the biggest container in this set is absolutely useless.\nFurthermore, as some other reviewers said, the plastic it's made of is very hard to clean and retains odor. While this is true of many plastic containers, whatever plastic they are using here seems to hold on to oil even more than usual. It takes so many rounds of soap and hot water to clean the containers well that it makes me feel guilty to use them.\nAt this point, this whole bulky set is gathering dust in a corner of our pantry. We have substituted the nissan stainless steel 10 oz containers for our warm stuff (they cannot go in the microwave, but you if you preheat with hot water for five-six minutes before putting your food in, the food will be hot until lunch) and fit+ fresh plastic containers of different sizes (which include icepacks fitting the lids) for our yogurt/desser/other cold stuff that might need refrigeration. This makes a flexible set, and combined with an insulated lunch bag, it has proven easier to fit in our bag (the zojirushi is great in volume, but I think the cylindrical shape is what makes it truly impossible to fit in your bag) and we have more options to pack our lunch. By the way, the fit and fresh stuff cleans more easily... if that is a plus for you.\nI am still happy with the Ms Bento for my toddler, although we are trying to move away from it because it is also hard to clean.";Good idea, cheap implementation: broke the first week

The cabbage absorbs the odor and the nasty smell is gone. (Don't eat the cabbage after though, it might taste a little funky.)\n\nIf you are up for a unique approach to healthier eating, than this is for you.

46;80.0;3.0;12.0;3045;I was really excited to buy Mr. Bento after reading all the reviews posted here.  I was looking for a bento box that will feed hungry, growing kids.  With Mr. Bento, I know that my kids and husband will get plenty to eat in school and in office.  It's very Chinese to have at least 3 dishes and a soup for each meal and Mr. Bento achieves this easily.  Moreover, in elementary schools where microwave is not available, this is the only way my kids will have hot lunches (with enough food) at school. I ended up buying 3 units from Amazon in August.\n\nEverything worked as planned until I washed the empty containers.\n\nThe first time I used Mr. Bento, I put some steamed snap peas (from Trader Joe's) in the top container for lunch.  I washed the containers that night and discovered that the lids from the containers (that had the Snap Peas) had a lingering odor (the smell of the snap peas, similar to beans) on the underside.  It didn't matter whether there were any snap peas left in the containers (my husband finished his and my daughter didn't), that snap pea odor remained on the lid after washing.\n\nI tried regular dishwashing detergent, baking soda/dish washing detergent, baking soda/dish washing detergent/vinegar combination to wash and soak the lids and nothing worked.\n\nLast week, the same thing happened again to the other tier container of the Mr. Bento when I packed Stirred fried vegetables Beijing style.  Now these lids have the smell from the sauce.  I cannot get rid off the odor from the sauce on these lids.\n\nSo I did some research on the internet and found out that it is a common occurrence to have odor on plastic containers/lids.  According to [...], one can prevent odor on lids by packing smelly foods separately (but sometimes it's hard to ascertain what constitutes smelly food until it's too late), by washing the container soon after eating (or at least throw away unwanted food bits and give it a quick rinse/wipe with a paper towel).  But in my case, the snap peas sat in the container from 7AM to noon which inevitably left odor on the lids of containers that no amount of wiping afterwards will help rid of the odor.  So when odor occurs, this is what  [...] suggests we do:\n\nAfter washing, put the open containers (lids off) in direct sunlight for an afternoon to air them out (storing the containers with their lids off also helps odors dissipate). For stubborn odors, some recommend applying a paste of lemon juice and baking soda. Cascade's Plastic Booster can be added to the dishwater (either dishwasher or handwashing) to help the detergent work on plastic, whitening and deodorizing plastics.\n\nI hope my experience with Mr. Bento will help other owners of Mr. Bento to avoid odor on lids.\n\nAlso, the 3 Mr. Bentos that I had purchased from Amazon all had the same serial number.  Shouldn't they have a different serial numbers for each product?  That's really odd!;Lingering odor on lids!
47;108.0;5.0;8.0;3056;"The Zojirushi Mr. Bento is an excellent product- so long as you have the information you need to know what you're getting and how to use it.\n\nWrapped in an easy-carry bag, you get the Mr. Bento jar (and a spoon, though I prefer to carry chopsticks). This jar is somewhat thermos-like, but it's not meant to keep coffee scalding hot for hours- it's meant to keep a Japanese lunch ready from morning to lunchtime, a role it's perfectly designed for. Inside the Mr. Bento jar are four serving dishes. The bottom bowl is intended for a soup or broth, and has a screw-on lid for that purpose. The next and larger bowl is intended to keep rice warm, and has a non-spill-proof top. Two smaller bowls are intended to hold an entree (protein) and a side item (vegetables). These items are not dishwasher- or microwave- safe, as the food is intended to be prepared warm in the morning and served as it is at lunch. The bottom soup bowl keeps the rice warm, which in turn keeps the meat at a good temperature, which in turn doesn't get warm enough to hurt your vegetables. It's a pretty smart system, really.\n\nSize seems an issue at first glance. The jar is only about six inches wide and a little taller, and the bowls therefore fit into an even smaller space. The total serving space is 41.6 ounces, and most Westerners will scoff at this- it's easily only half the space of a traditional lunch box. However, the wonderful secret of this jar is that this space is actually enough room to fit a meal fit for front-line combat troops if you know how to use it.\n\nConverted to millileters (the standard measurement system for bento capacity), this jar contains 1,230ml of food. In a standard Japanese layout, the size of a bento roughly corresponds to the calories contained. Thus, this bento can contain about 1,200 calories if all you're filling it with is the standard soup/rice/meat/veggie layout. The same containers could easily store chili/sandwich/steak/dessert, skyrocketing the calorie count. Thus, Mr. Bento can easily hold a full 2-3 times the calories a child would need for a meal, and well over what any adult should need. Your problem using the jar therefore isn't trying to cram a meal into it, it's realizing that you actaully need to underfill it a little to eat healthy! (And oh how you'll rethink your portion sizes once you see the difference).\n\nThere are a few downsides to Mr. Bento that are worth mentioning. First up is the obvious problem of the format. The soup jar is the only really spillproof unit, so you're a little limited in how you can mix up your foods. The system is also designed so the food shares heat as described above. If you want to mix hot foods and cold desserts in the same container, you're going to have to do some experimentation to see how much the heat transfers through the day (although it's easy to build a reverse temperature system with a cold soup up to warm meats or etc). There's also the non-dishwasher-safe bit, which may or may not be an issue for you. The small vented lid for the soup can be a little hard to pop out and clean, but if you use chopsticks like me, the solution is obvious.\n\nAs many have suggested, this is an excellent alternative to other ways of carrying lunch. Search up any of the fine ""bento cookbooks"" Amazon offers, and dig in! You'll spend a little bit extra time and thought in food preparation to use this item, but when you do, the health (and energy, and focus...) benefits of eating with this system are just too good to pass up.";Excellent product, more information
48;139.0;3.0;6.0;3116;I ordered this lunch box for my intensive summer workshop. I heated up Chinese food every morning in these bowls around 7am, and by noon, the food was still hot. This lunch box basically meets my need.\n\nBut you really need to know how this thing works before you order it. As many other reviewers pointed out, only the bottom two bowls can keep hot or cold, and the top two only remain room temperature. In fact, the top ones will remain the temperature of whatever you have in the bottom two bowls. I had heated Chinese food in the bottom bowls one day and some salad in the top ones. By lunch time, the cold salad was totally heated up and tasted horrible.\n\nThe bowls are easily cleaned, but as all other plastic containers, they keep a bit of the food smell even after you completely clean them. It makes me feel that this thing can't really last very long before I totally feel uncomfortable with it.\n\nThe size is good for me, since I don't eat a lot. But it feels way too small for a big guy or teenager boy. Also it only fits Asian food or pasta-type of food. There is no chance you can stuff a sandwich, let's say half of the regular Subway size, in even the biggest bowl.\n\nI really wish the bowls could be glass or something not catching the food smell. This is my biggest problem with the product.;It's good, but can be better.
49;124.0;3.0;7.0;3145;I think I was attracted to the idea of the Mr Bento mainly because of its neat look. I really hate shlepping a shopping bag of mismatched tupperware and reused cool whip tubs. The size is comparable to a 2 liter of soda, possibly shorter. As previous reviews have mentioned, the carrying bag must be utilized as there are no handles. The containers are an unappetizing grey which quickly turn orange in the presence of ketchup. I now use either fast food packets of the stuff, or a reusable cupcake liner for acidic condiments. The soup containers retain heat relatively well. The entree container, not so much, even when you follow the manufacturer's instructions and preheat containers in hot water.\nOther reviewers claim that this is ideal for the traditional Japanese lunch, which may be true. I tend to eat a great deal of Indian and Middle Eastern food, which i do not recommend in the Mr Bento, as it will absorb some of the flavors, and you can no longer use a container that once held a curry dish to hold cottage cheese down the road. Unless you like a curried cottage cheese.\n\nOn the bright side, someone in the forum contacted customer service, there are no BPAs in the plastic, so at least it is non toxic!\n\nI do believe that it could be useful for exactly what it was intended for - a traditional Japanese meal, but it is not versatile enough to meet my needs.;room for improvement
50;126.0;3.0;7.0;3265;My Mr. Bento is fantastic in many ways.  My food stays hot until lunch.  I pack a variety of foods in the containers, and this has helped me to expand my usual lunch menu.  My Mr. Bento is attractive (except for the black bag that holds it).\n\nHowever, the Bento is too heavy to carry to work every day!  This won't be an issue so much for people who drive to work, but I take the el and being burdened with a heavy lunch bag usually proves to be too big an inconvenience.  I often leave it at home because I don't want the bother of carrying it.;Great--But Too Heavy!
51;127.0;4.0;7.0;3276;I recently discovered the magic of thermos. Oddly enough, I had never used a thermos before, nor had anyone in my family, so I didn't realize such a thing existed. (Laugh, but I really had no idea!) So, recently I bought a Stanley wide mouth thermos for soup, and was blown away! Of course, then I had to do research to find out more about thermos'. That's when I discovered Mr. Bento.\n\nMy job is to sit and wait for a phone to ring. I cannot leave my desk unless I ask someone to come and watch the phone for me. So it is very difficult to leave for even a few minutes, let alone have time to heat things up in the microwave. So, I was bringing unhealthy snack foods: lots of carbs, and in large quantities. Chips, pretzels, crackers and cheese, cookies, etc.\n\nI was looking for a solution to my bad eating habits, since at home, I tend to eat pretty healthy. Mr. Bento is the perfect solution. I was concerned at first about the size of the containers. They looked so small in comparison to the large bags of snacks I was bringing every day. But I figured, this was part of the deal: I needed to be eating less, and more healthy foods.\n\nSo far, I have followed the directions to the letter, but the bottom bowl has not yet stayed piping hot by lunch time. The food goes in steaming hot or boiling, and by lunch time, it is warm. Now, this isn't getting in my way much at all. If I want hot soup, I will use my Stanley thermos, and pack stuff for a salad and some fruit in Mr. Bento.\n\nThere are some great lunch ideas out there. Check out the Flickr groups about Mr. Bento and there are hundreds of pictures of Mr. Bento. My very first lunch was 3 breaded eggplant slices (from Trader Joes) which stayed WARM (not hot). The second bowl up was sesame tofu which I cut up into small squares to put into my salad. The third bowl was lettuce for salad and some mushrooms, while the last bowl I used for sliced plum and kiwi. I was STUFFED by the end of my lunch and had a very small dinner that night!\n\nOverall, I have been impressed with Mr. Bento. They say not to have hot stuff and cold stuff inside the thermos, but I haven't had any problems with that thus far. If you NEED to have hot stuff in the bottom 2 containers, and cold things in the top two, use a double layer of tinfoil to separate the hot and cold items, and use re-usable ice cubes inside the top 2 bowls, which tends to work great.\n\nEveryone at work is very interested in Mr. Bento and wants to get one for themselves. I've noticed that since I've been bringing Mr. Bento to work, others are following my example by bringing less snacks and more healthy foods.;Mr. Bento is my new best friend!
52;128.0;5.0;7.0;3359;"I ordered the Mr. Bento lunch jar because I was tired of eating out for lunch at work, or worse yet, hitting up the vending machines.\n\nMy Bento jar arrived quickly, and in perfect condition. Unlike some previous purchasers, I did get an English translation of the instructions with my Bento jar, although it's a pretty foolproof product as long as you know not to microwave the lids or treat it too harshly.\n\nWhen I use my Mr. Bento jar, I pack and stack it the night before and then set it in my refrigerator for the whole thing to chill. It won't fit into the refrigerator at work (too tall) so it sits on my desk at the office until I am ready to eat.\n\nBecause I have access to a microwave, I don't need to keep my food hot. However, I have found that my Mr. Bento does do an excellent job of keeping my food nice and cool, although not ice cold. Others have done an excellent job of reviewing how Mr. Bento keeps the food cold (i.e. while not being a full-on thermos, it's got plenty of insulation between the bowls, their lids, and the metal outer shell).\n\nThe carrying bag is fashioned out of a nice stiff canvas with a zipper and a pull enclosure. I love the spork and spork cover that comes with the jar as well.\n\nAs I eat my food during the workday, I wash out each bowl at the sink in our office kitchen and take it back to my desk. At the end of the day I go home, put it on the counter, and pack it and chill it before going to bed.\n\nMy goal with this product was to eat healthier and more regularly during the day. My typical Bento jar has the following:\n- Top (smallest uninsulated) bowl: a handful of pretzels and a few lowfat animal crackers\n- Second (larger uninsulated) bowl: carrot sticks and hummus (hummus in a silicon cupcake cup)\n- Third (main, insulated) bowl: 1/2C of cooked rice with chicken or black beans or some other veggies/meat.\n- Fourth (bottom, insulated) soup bowl: A homemade soup, this week it's been corn chowder\n\nMy intention was to eat regularly throughout the day, every couple of hours, to keep my blood sugar levels steady and hopefully lose weight, control cravings etc. That was my intention. The only problem? There's just too much food! I have to really work to eat my way through all of the food that fits into my Mr. Bento, and I rarely can. Usually either the soup or the main bowl ends up in the refrigerator at the office, while I take home the other 3 bowls and refill them for the next day. I'm a 5'6"" woman, medium build, with a pretty good appetite, but it's just too much food for me.\n\nOn the plus side, my husband loves my Mr. Bento. In fact, he's eyeing it jealously. So I have splurged yet again and bought the Ms. Bento (3 bowls) for myself. As soon as it arrives, my husband will inherit my Mr. Bento for his lunches.\n\nThe beauty of the Bento jars, and ""bento"" in general, is that it's great for people like me who want more creative lunches, and who are sick of sandwiches and potato chips and what have you. The product is great, and while it's a little expensive, the money I save from not raiding the snack machine ($5 a week, at least) alone will pay for the Bento jar in just a couple of months. Highly recommended, but if you don't have a big appetite, you might want to consider a Ms. Bento instead of this jar.";Excellent Bento - But So Much Food!

54;86.0;2.0;12.0;3462;First of all, don't be fooled by its appearance: This is not a Thermos. It will not keep your food warm or cold. For this reason, the instructions say to avoid using it for dairy products, and to consume food withing a few hours.\n\nSecond, and perhaps most important, all of the bowls leak. Even the soup bowl, with a screw-on lid and gasket, leaks. The instructions say to always keep Mr. Bento perfectly upright. Try doing that in your car on your commute to work. It's impossible.\n\nIn practice, the only thing Mr. Bento is good for arranging your food in pretty ways, so that you can post photos on Flickr. That's not very practical when your yogurt is spoiled not to mention spilled all over the inside of the container. I've since gone back to using a couple of $1 food containers, which at least don't leak. Also, when I put them in the fridge at work, my coworkers don't constantly ask me why I'm taking up valuable fridge space with a Thermos.;Highly Overrated
55;88.0;5.0;12.0;3513;Leave it to the Japanese to innovate sack lunches!\n\nI purchased this lunch kit after seeing a co-worker many years ago with a Nissan version.  I have a Zojirushi rice cooker, so I know they make quality stuff.  After re-reading the reviews between the Mr Bento and the Nissan version, I bought the Mr Bento b/c of the volume of favorable reviews as well as other tangibles, such as the carrying case, spoon, and the cool design.\n\nProduct-wise, I am very happy.  Despite some negative reviews about it not being insulated, I really don't understand what they are talking about.  We have an electric water kettle that I fill up the night before to about 4 cups.  When I go downstairs for breakfast, I flip the switch and take my bento containers out that I want to heat up in the microwave. I'll eat my yogurt or breakfast in the meantime.  When the water is done, I'll pour the water into Mr Bento and allow it to sit for about 5 to 10 minutes.  At the tail end of the water time, I'll microwave my food for about 2-3 minutes.  Then I'll dump the water and put the food into the container.  I have had some late lunches (2 to 3pm) on occasion and the food was still warm-hot...hot enough to eat.\n\nOne thing you'll notice is that you will *think* that you are not eating enough, but once you dig into your own lunches, you will probably not be very hungry!  You can pack alot of food.  Perhaps we Americans are so used to being overfed when we buy lunch outside.\n\nIn terms of design, here are my two gripes:  1) the bottom most soup container can be a real bear to open sometimes, esp when it is damp and/or tightly closed.  2) I wish the top closable dome lid was metal like the body of the Mr. Bento.  Plastic dome = cheap.  Similarly, I wish the latch/clasps were metal.  Plastic = wear.\n\nThe nice bag is a great value add.  If you can't tell, there are two extra pouches sewed onto the outside. Great for sauce packets or mid meal snacks.\n\nTips: 1) I cut out an old metallic bubble type car shade into a circle and use it as an insulation barrier for the hot and the cold food.  Personally, i think it makes a big difference.  If you do the same, make sure that the circle is slightly bigger than the cylinder itself so you get a good seal.  2) Cut your food into bite sized pieces.  Cutting anything inside these containers is not easy, esp the taller one. On that note, I purchased a Boker Snacpac as someone recommended b/c of the portability of the entire utensil set.  The knife is the only good thing about it.  The spoon is useless for anything but stirring a French espresso in a little cup.  the fork is way too narrow.  So I just use the supplied Mr. Bento spoon and the Boker knife which is quite nice.  3) If you have foods or sauces that you think might stain, consider lightly oiling the surface with your fingers or use Saran Wrap to line the inside (which is what I do).\n\nSpare parts: yes, they do have them and for just about every part, including container lids.  I will post up the reply I received from a nice Zojirushi representative at a later date.\n\nOh yeah, I have been losing a little weight b/c now I am in control of my meals.  Not to mention with gas prices the way they are now, every little kind of money saving activities like packing lunch helps in the end.;I love this thing!
56;116.0;4.0;8.0;3556;"I'm only on my fourth Mr. Bento lunch day, but already I'm loving it!  The only complaint I have is that the upper two bowls with the snap on lids don't stay cold.  It's difficult to mix hot and cold the way that this is designed.  You either need to make a cold/room temp lunch or warm/room temp lunch.  There are some ingenious ways you can mix temperatures though, from making a metal disk out of roof flashing to reflect heat to freezing yogurt or pudding into the lower of the two upper bowls to keep them cool.  I've found that works very well, my yogurt is defrosted by lunch time and the upper bowl has in turn been kept cold, but the lower two bowls are still piping hot.  I haven't found that freezing yogurt has any unappetizing affect on the yogurt's texture or taste.\n\nThe bowls are indeed quite large, and even with a vegetarian diet (generally considered to be low-calorie), I have no problems stuffing my Mr. Bento with 800-900 calories worth of food.  That's a very large meal!  I usually eat 400-500 in one sitting, so I use some bowls for lunch and others for snacks.  The possibilities in combinations are endless, and I'm enjoying coming up with new ideas for snacks and meals.  Today was mulligatawny soup, quinoa with fresh mozzarella and eggplant-tomato ragu, yogurt with pineapple and granola, and chickpea salad.  The outer pocket on the carrying case is the perfect place to fit my 3pm protein bar and is useful for carrying napkins and a sandwich bag of granola so it doesn't get mushy.\n\nI'm not really in need of keeping foods hot or cold at work since we have both a fridge and microwave, though both are questionable in regards to cleanliness.  It's nice not to have to ""heat and eat"", since I can do that in the morning when I pack the jar.  I just open up my Mr. Bento and start eating.  Neat!  Mr. Bento's usefulness really comes into play after bike races.  My teammates will be sitting around nibbling on a sports bar and protein shake, meanwhile I'm stuffing my face with hot daal, basmati rice and garlic naan.  Can we say jealous!??!\n\nYes, $40+ might be a bit much for a lunch box, but I figure I only need to bring my lunch 4x a week for 2 weeks to break even on eating out.  Plus, I tend to pack much healthier foods and I know what the calorie content is of everything in my lunch jar... something that can't be said when dining out.";Perfect for lunch!
57;131.0;5.0;7.0;3569;I was unsure if this would be too big or too small. Some reviewers said it was way too small which is not true for me. I calculated the amount of food it could hold in ounces and it turns out to be about 5 cups or 41.6 ounces. I don't know if I can fit 5 cups of food in my stomach all the time if at all. The bowls may look small, but the soup container holds a little over a cup. The Mr. Bento holds a lot of food, but it is in a compact space so it doesn't really take much more space than the lunch totes my kids already have. It's a little taller, but it's thinner because it's all stacked so I like the way it fits in their rolling backpacks. I pack less for the kids unless we will be going on an extended trip, and I put non food items in the bowl/bowls I don't put food in. Make sure you put hot or cold water in the soup bowl when you don't put food in it if you want to keep the largest food bowl hot or cold.\n\n  The other thing that worried me was the leaking. Well, The soup bowl doesn't leak even though I purposely filled it with hot water and stood it on its side for a few hours and also upside down. I shook it very hard for a couple of minutes and nothing came out. I haven't tried the other containers, but I think they will be fairly leak proof because the lids fit tight, but I don't plan on putting liquids in the other bowls.\n\n  The last thing that I wanted to know is if the food would stay hot in the Mr. Bento since some people complained it didn't work. I have a large bowl filled with about 5 cups of water that I microwave for 6 minutes. I then put that hot water in the lunch jar for a little over 5-7 minutes. I microwave the soup bowl and the large bowl together for 4 minutes and keep them in the microwave until the lunch jar is done heating. I then put the hot water back in the bowl I microwaved it in for future use. I wipe out the Mr. Bento and stack the food bowls in it. The heat lasted 6 hours and there was a tiny bit of steam from the bottom two bowls. I don't know about the cold rentention, but I think it would be even better. I do fill the bowls the night before so I dont' have to do it in the morning. I also make a lot of the foods ahead and then freeze them.\n\n  By the way, extra food bowl sets can be ordered from the company if you call them. I think that will come in handy if I ever lose the gasket in the soup bowl. The best part of the soup bowl is that it won't get stuck and you can still open it easily a few hours later. I originally had the Aladdin Heat and Go bowls which were great until you wanted to eat because the lid would get stuck on once the vacuum formed a couple of hours later. My kids almost went hungry a few times when all of the adults at school could barely get the lids off. I have heard that some people ended up throwing out those bowls with the food still in them. This is actually what led me to Mr. Bento which is great set.;Great quality and fun to use

The top two containers are not really leak proof.  They are for items no need to be heated.  The bottom one is for soup therefore if you would bring something very watery, use the bottom container.  The biggest one retains heat well.  I nuke my steamed rice in it every morning before leaving for work.  By lunch time the rice is still warm.\n\nAt first I questioned if Mr. Bento will leave me hungry for more.  After two weeks, I realize that the stomach is a funny organ.

We use it almost everyday.\n\nThe bottom two containers are for hot food; the bottom one for soup, and the second from the bottom is meant for hot rice.  We almost always have hot rice in the rice cooker (kept warm), and I make a simple quick miso soup in the morning. The top two containers are meant for room temp. or cold food.  I usually fill one with dinner leftover, and the other with cut fruit pieces.  It helps to preheat the hot food containers as well as the main unit by pouring hot water in the bottom.  This way, Mr. Bento will keep the food hot for over 4 hours.  I've wanted to use it myself, so last summer I borrowed my son's Mr. Bento for my lunch to take to work.  My son was right.  What a great lunch box! Home cooked food served hot right where you are.  It's healthy and economical.\n\nAlthough it was not recommended, I put all the inner containers, lids and all, in the dish washer top rack and they wash just fine.  As long as you remove the lids, the food containers can be used in microwave to heat food before you pack it in the Mr. Bento unit.  The carrying case is very convenient, too.  It is a bit heavy, so I wouldn't recommend it for a small child who has to walk to school.  Over all, this has been a great investment.  If you are health conscious and would like to eat home cooked meal for lunch, this would be for you.  We absolutely love it. I didn't think we would use it this often, perhaps a couple of times a week. But my son carries this to school just about everyday now. Because you can reheat and put last night's dinner leftover in the lunch, it's actually a lot easier than making a sandwich and assemble various other lunch pieces!";My son and I love Mr. Bento!
66;100.0;5.0;10.0;3711;"The point of getting this for my fiance was to get something better than sandwiches going in his blue collar lifestyle.  He's very tough on things!!  Mr. Bento was tough enough to stand up to his brutal ways.  I think that the flexible spork cover will be the first thing to break over the years, but we've lost it in the abyss of the ""work truck"" so we may never know.\n\nI worried about cleaning because the last thing I need, (well, maybe not the very last, but close), is to get up in the morning and have to scrub the thing out because it's not dishwasher safe.  I'm not a risk taker, so I haven't tested this warning for its validity.  Washing these containers is really easy because they are smoother than tupperware and are well-rounded, (even without attending college!).  It's easy to slide out the left overs and give it a quick run with dish soap.  Not a problem.  It is also less likely to stain with things like spaghetti, but upon microwaving, very little things in the world can resist the temptation of the orange tinted sauce residue.\n\nThe biggest container, (second to last), is not entirely air tight.  This shouldn't be a problem for most people because you will likely not be throwing it this way and that and storing it upside down until your lunch break.  This is the second hottest container as it is above the thick smaller hot container and not so near the top.\n\nSpeaking of the top, it has two firm buckle snaps that are easy to quickly slap on and very secure.  No shinanigans there.\n\nI usually put something not so crucial near the top like potato salad or  fruit.  He doesn't seem to mind, but he has mentioned that if you put things on the top two containers, they don't stay as hot.  Now I just use them for raw eggs and fish... ;)  The top containers are much like any other quality tupperware in regards to the lid style, as opposed to the bottom two which screw on.\n\nThe bag is spiffy-keen because it's made out of durable material with a side zipper for easy transfers.  The top is secured by one of those cinch string thingy-ma-bobbers.  I like pockets around the sides of the bag, (the spork/chopsticks have their own little slide in section inside the bag), because I can put extra things and napkins in there.  I've even crammed crackers for his soup in there once or twice.\n\nMy fiance and I have tested the product under harsh conditions for you and have found little limitations of Mr Bento.  I recommend this product because he is eating healthier food and it takes only a little more time than the extravagant sandwiches I used to cram every food group into.  It's tough, smooth and can withstand hurricanes.  You won't regret it.\n\nCaboose.";Wow... healthy food!
67;132.0;4.0;7.0;3720;I chose Mr. Bento for incentive to save on lunches out. It requires some thought in the evening, but provides a good method to use leftovers and introduce variety into the business of lunch. The containers are ample in size and keep the food intact without leakage. I bring an instant soup in the soup container (the bottom one), since I have an electric tea kettle and microwave available at work, and so haven't had the warming and cooling issues others have experienced. Nutritionists say we should have more different varieties of fruit and vegetable servings for optimal health (the usual prescription is 10 different ones per day, but it is noteworthy that the Japanese think we should have 20), and Mr. Bento assists greatly in that effort. Studies show great apes eat 200 different types of growing things in their daily peregrinations, so it's a safe bet paleolithic man had a more varied diet than we do. Mr. Bento beats the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I used to bring when I didn't splurge on lunch out. It's a big container and therefore a backpack rather than a briefcase item. I recommend it if you can carry it, although the nice bag it comes with allows carrying it separately without too much trouble, especially if you drive to work (I take mass transit). The spork is fine, but you'll need a spoon if you have soup.;Suitable for the purpose
68;49.0;5.0;22.0;3753;I don't know what I did before lunch without Mr. Bento. I take that back, I do know. I carried my lunch in Gladware containers inside a crumpled up Wal-Mart bag.\n\nOne has to remember that as this is a Japanese product, the manufacturer had the interests of Japanese consumers in mind when designing this product. This lunch jar is made for the typical Japanese lunch, which usually contains soup, rice, preserved fish or meat and some pickles. You aren't going to find foods that will spoil easily in their lunches such as dairy, and many Japanese use complimentary pairings to keep food from spoiling, ie packing foods with natural antibacterial properties with those that are more perishable. It is really quite interesting. That being said, this doesn't mean that Mr. Bento is less than ideal for the Western lunch, in fact it is quite to the contrary.\n\nThere are workarounds to the problem of the Western lunch. I have tried a few times to combine hot and cold combinations in the same lunch jar and it has simply never worked for me. Here's the technique anyway: Some advise filling the jar up only halfway with boiling water and filling the bottom two containers with boiling water and letting them sit while you prepare your lunch. You then heat up your food to go in the bottom two containers until it is steaming hot. Dump the water out of the containers and immediately fill them up with the hot food and seal the lids tightly. You are then supposed to take a small kitchen towel and place it between the top two and bottom two bowls. Your cold food goes in the top two. I find that the laws of physics overrule here: Heat rises and cold sinks, therefore you wind up with a lunch pail full of lukewarm food. I have found that it works out better for me to go all the way hot or all the way cold. If you have a pail full of hot food and use the boiling water technique, Mr. Bento does a decent job keeping your food warm, but it won't be steaming hot. At least not in my experience. Most of the time this is just not an issue for me anyway because I usually put my Mr. Bento in the break room refrigerator when I get to work. However, occasionally I float to a different job site which has a microwave but no fridge. In this case, I keep all the food cold in Mr. Bento and just nuke the applicable containers at lunch time. I find this the most convenient method for me. It is a lot easier to keep food cold than hot. Due to the generous size and amount of the Mr. Bento food containers, I usuallly have more room than I need for my lunch. What I do is buy those blue ice packets that have individual cells (think the size of an ice cube) on large sheets. You can cut out each individual cell and have a nice little size packet of blue ice. I find that I can fit nine of these into the larger of the two non-insulated containers (the second one down from the top.) Then I have the bottom two and the very top container for my lunch. I pack everything in the containers and keep them in the fridge overnight (except for the container packed with ice, which gets stored in the freezer.) I even keep the outer stainless steel container in the fridge, so it stays nice and cold. In the morning I just assemble everything together, which takes less than a minute, and I'm out the door. Whenever I open my lunch five hours later, it is alway still cold.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I find that Mr. Bento has ample room for my lunch. I usually reserve the bottom two containers for my lunch components and the top container holds an afternoon snack. The beauty of Mr. Bento for me, is how creative it has made me become when packing my lunches. I know this sounds corny but for me, lunch is more than just lunch now, it is an experience. I look forward to packing my lunches every evening and challenging myself with new ways to fill Mr. Bento. Most of the time, it is just leftovers, but I am always looking for little things to sneak into my lunch. I have found that I am eating a lot more vegetables simply because the many containers lend themselves so well to variety. I usually put cut fruit in the top container, or cheese and crackers for a snack. The mini Baybel cheeses and laughing cow cheese wedges are perfect for this. I usually have a salad in the soup container and an entree in the bottom container. Sloppy joes and other sandwiches work perfect with Mr. bento. The bottom (largest) container is the perfect size to hold a hamburger bun. The filling goes in the soup container and you just assemble it at lunchtime. I have even done soft tacos many times. Simply put your hot fillings in the soup container, your lettuce, tomato, etc. in the bottom container and sour cream, salsa, etc. in one of the other containers. Just wrap your tortillas in some plastic wrap and they fit perfectly inside the fabric case, wrapped around the outer lunch jar. You can do the same for burritos, wraps and pita sandwiches. There is also a pocket on the outside where you can keep packets of salt and pepper, soy sauce, hot sauce, etc. I keep a packet of Emergen-c in mine. My Mr. Bento came with chopsticks but I don't find this to be a problem at all. Sometimes I use the chopsticks, especially if I am having noodles. But when I need western utensils, I simply replace the chopsticks with a fork and/or spoon wrapped in a napkin. Works perfectly.\n\nMr. Bento is also very stylish looking. I like the black carrying case with strap. It compliments my bag and business attire very nicely. It certainly looks a lot nicer than toting into the office a crumpled up Wal-Mart bag with Gladware inside.\n\nOverall, Mr. Bento is a very versatile product and accomodates my lunchtime needs very nicely.;Mr. Bento is the ultimate lunchbox
69;68.0;5.0;16.0;3754;I was sick of the little food containers rattling around the bottom of my lunch bag on the way to work, and matching up the lids was driving me crazy.  The reviews for Mr. Bento were so incredible, I bit the bullet and paid $42 for my own Mr. Bento.  I am here to tell you that the reviews are accurate, and that Mr. Bento is life-changing.\n\nMr. Bento is hassle-free and cleans up easily.  I have a microwave at work, so I fill the mini containers and put them in the fridge overnight.  In the morning, I pop them in the thermos and go to work.  They are still cold at lunch, so I don't have to worry about spoilage.  Then I heat up what's necessary and still have cold yogurt, applesauce or whatever for a snack later.  Since ordering Mr. Bento, I bring lunch far more often.  Why?  Taking out all the little containers offers all the drama of buying lunch without the expense.  Leftovers become way more interesting when you have to open mystery containers to find them.  Moreover, I have room to pack breakfast, lunch, AND a snack.  Mr. Bento automatically controls portions, but I eat a better variety of food now.  And the carrying case is weighted perfectly for comfortable transport in the hand (I have not tried the shoulder strap).\n\nThe caveats are small: Do not microwave the lids, and store the little containers with the lids OFF.  The food smells (even tuna - thank goodness) will disperse overnight.  Do not be afraid.  Mr. Bento is on your side.;Mr. Bento is life-changing
70;144.0;2.0;6.0;3771;Since I get Mr. Bento, every day lunch is much fun and health than I went to out eat. I lose 5 Ibs by bring my own lunch.\nThe Jar can hold soup warm.\nBelieve me for those people like bring their own lunch should have this lunch jar.;Lunch will be never boring
71;106.0;2.0;9.0;3786;If you have several meetings at different locations and lugging a laptop/briefcase and this lunch canister in it's carrying case, it's a poor choice because it's heavy and cumbersome.  I wanted more variety for lunch so initially, this was a truly attractive item.  Unfortunately, after a single use, I went back to my compact and light weight brown bag lunches and the canister is sitting in my kitchen gathering dust.;It's a wonderful product in theory, but...
72;61.0;1.0;18.0;3792;The first time we used this, it leaked everywhere and ruined my daughter's school books. I had high hopes for it, but was very frustrated and disappointed.;Disappointment
73;119.0;5.0;8.0;3801;Ok,  I have read all the reviews and have bought the Bento Jar and I love it. I am Greek-American and I have taken Spaghetti and meat sauce, green beans, Greek Chicken and rice soup, and rice pudding in it to work.  Everything was great.  Now they are not piping hot.  My daughter uses it and takes the same things.  She says it is great in school were you don't have time for everything to cool off.  She indicated that the dishes are warm on the bottom and semi-cool on top.  I have found the same thing.  If you look at European cultures many do not eat their food super hot - so you may have to adapt, but I can tell you it is worth it.  Not only have I save money on lunches at work, I have started to lose weight and have more energy as I am able to control proportions and contents.  This product in awesome.\n\nEfhtemia;Great for Lunches Japanese or Otherwise
74;145.0;4.0;6.0;3802;I love being able to bring leftovers to work. The thermos works great keeping food hot. The 2 bottom bowls and hard to get the lids on and off and sometimes leaky. The other 2 are pop and snap easy lids. The bowls hold a LOT of food.;Good idea
75;146.0;3.0;6.0;3808;Fun product. Travels well. Appealing.\nLids do not microwave well. Become malformed and won't seal again.;Great for portion control and using leftovers for lunch
76;40.0;5.0;25.0;3810;Before buying Mr. Bento, I've searched all the other lunch boxes offered by Amazon and analyzed how I would use it (being an engineer, these things interest me).  I chose Mr. Bento over the Thermos model since I really liked the idea of having hot and room temperature food all in the same container (from reviews of the Thermos brand, it keeps all the containers warmer than Mr. Bento).  I liked it so much after a week of use that I bought a second one so that I can pre-pack dry food for multiple days.\n\nThermal capacity is really good, when I pre-heat the sleeve and bottom two containers with boiling water.  With bottom container full of near-boiling liquid/soup, it is still very hot five hours later and keeps the main container warm enough.  Without hot soup there, bottom two containers are warm, but not as hot as I would like it to be.  When I'm not packing soup, I would fill the soup bowl with boiling water, which keeps the main container nice and hot.\n\nThe top two smaller pop-top containers are meant for room-temperature food, though the bottom of the two gets a bit warm.  I found that using a micro-fiber towel cut to fit to separate between the hot and cool containers, help the upper containers stay closer to room temperature.  Without the towel separation, my tomatoes and cherries packed in the bottom of the two pop-top containers out of the refrigerator gets a bit warm.  I have not yet used it to pack cold food in all the containers, but would expect to be perform better than hot food application due to lesser temperature difference.\n\nI did find that soup bowl gets a bit hard to turn when tightened hard and when the container is wet, but found that pulling on the top as opening helps.  Upper two pop-top type containers are better sealing than the reviews indicate.\n\nCarry bag is definitely very cool and functional, though it makes me swing it around as I'm carrying it (containers don't leak if used per Manufacturer's directions).  It allows me to pack some health bars and napkins, as well as put a fruit packet or one additional pop-top containers on top and close it up (making it almost five container Mr. Bento for long days in the office).  It can be used to carry real spoon, if you are not happy with the spork IMHO not as nice as using a real spoon.  Spork is very nice stainless steel, made in Japan, and great back-up when I forget to pack utensils.\n\nAfter using for over a month, would agree with other reviewers that this is really a great item and would last quite a long time.  With Mr. Bento, Nissan Thermos full of home-roasted Americano style coffee, I'm ready to hit the work hard at the office and don't have to worry about keeping my stomach happy.  To those home packing to lose weight, trying to eat healthier meals, or just sick of cafeteria food or fast food......Mr. Bento will be a great investment.;Great Lunch Box
77;135.0;5.0;7.0;3812;I've only had it less than a week, but I love it! I can take hot food out and about with me, and have a hot, easy lunch.\n\nThe four dishes are great - I can have soup, two scoop rice, some pickles, and some fruit, all in one container.\n\nMy only complaint with this is that the spork that comes with it is totally unusable for soup, and it doesn't come with chopsticks. Of course, the description doesn't say that it DOES come with chopsticks, but one would think that a Japanese lunch box would come with them. But, no mind - my chopsticks fit very easily into the bag the lunch jar fits into.\n\nSolidly built like everything from Zojirushi, this will last for a long time.\n\nWonderful!;I love it!
78;57.0;1.0;19.0;3827;I purchased this item so that my six year old son could have healthy and warm food at lunch time.  He was unable to open the lids, so I thought I would keep it for me.  I placed boiling water in each of the containers to preheat them and placed hot food in them at 7:30 a.m.  At 12:30 I pulled my lunch out to find that it is all room temperature.  I just printed the labels to return this product to Amazon.;Cold Food Hard to Open Lids

80;59.0;4.0;19.0;3861;"I agree with all the comments here.  Mr. Bento is superior to other American  old style lunch boxes that you had as a kid.  For me, this type of lunch jar, is what I am used to growing up.  Although back then, they didn't have the technology as they do now, and the metal lunch jars, were taken to schools, and then had to be steamed before eating.\n\nThe only reason I gave this lunch jar 4 stars instead of 5, is that these new lunch jars are no longer made in Japan. I think the manufacturing costs got too high or they just decided to move manufacturing offshore.\n\nMy girl friend has the Mr. Bento that she bought back in 1998, and they were made in Japan.  The lid on that older bento, was better built, thus keeping heat in ALL 4 CONTAINERS.  The food stayed hotter, and there usually is steam coming out of the rice and soup container, and the top 2 containers were hot, not room temperature.\n\nAnother lunch jar, made by Thermos Nissan joint venture, called the Stainless Steel Widemouth Lunch Tote - 48-oz.  by Thermos, is better at keeping the containers hot than the Mr. and Miss Bentos.  If you do a search at amazon.com with ""nissan stainless lunch"", you'll find it.\n\nStill, the 5 people I bought this for Christmas, was very happy with the lunch jar.";Great lunch jar, but it used to be better
81;154.0;4.0;5.0;3866;I love this product.  I can pack my food (usually soup, rice, vegetable, and another vegetable) in the morning.  As long as I use very, very hot soup, it is still warm at lunch.  Not hot, but warm.  It fits nicely in its carrier, making it easy to transport.  The only thing I dislike is cleaning all those containers, but then, I hate cleaning any containers.  I find this no harder to wash than if I had to wash 4 seperate tupperware containers.;A great way to take a multi-course lunch
82;109.0;5.0;9.0;3885;"I am thrilled with my Mr. and Ms. Bento. My husband takes the Mr. to work and I take the much smaller Ms. Bento. The quality of these jars is excellent, and the bags that accompany them are great too; I love my little lunch handbag, and the bag with the Mr. is manly enough for my husband. We both laughed when we realized that mine came with chopsticks and his came with a metal spork. Honestly, a spork? Chopsticks are more useful, in my opinion.\n\nI think having these has encouraged healthy eating. The Mr. is big enough for even my husband's voracious appetite (yesterday's lunch was Shanghai beef and brown rice, California roll and almonds for a snack, steamed veggies, sugar-free pudding, and chocolate soy milk). Ms. is small enough that it's hard to go overboard, but if I pack carefully I find that I have plenty to eat. Also, packing these every night or morning sparks my creative side, and not only do I have fun making a pretty layout (and trying to cater to hubby's picky-ness), but I find that thinking that much about what we are eating leads me to pack healthier food.\n\nIn short, I love my Ms. Bento, and my mister loves the Mr. (heh). They are sturdy, high quality, and I think they will last forever. Add that to the fact that they help us maintain a healthy diet, and these are two of the best things I've purchased in recent memory.";Completely in love with Mr. and Ms. Bento
83;77.0;5.0;14.0;3894;When I bought this item, I had been trying to take food to office to save money and to eat the same gourmet food at work that I cook at home on a regular basis. Having owned it for a few months now, I would say I am very satisfied with my purchase. The whole design of Mr Bento is very different from the concept of lunch in the West. This set is meant to be used in a certain way, and if that suits you, then this is a great deal. If it does not, look elsewhere.\n\nThe good-sized jar has four plastic (microwavable unless empty) containers of differing sizes that must be stacked in a certain order. The round bowl at the bottom of the jar is insulated and is meant to carry soup and to keep it hot for 3-4 hours. The second container from bottom (the largest one) , also insulated, is meant for rice. The top two containers can be used for whatever else you'd like, and have no insulation. I typically take fruit or yogurt in the top two containers. I use the bottom container for home-made soup and the large container for my entree. I've tried lasagna, beef burgundy, chicken fried rice and Indian curries and they were warm after 4 hours. Rinsing the bottom two bowls with warm water before filling them makes a difference.\n\nCONS: This is not going to accommodate pizza slices, burgers or hoagies. The jar itself is not dishwasher safe and has to be hand-washed with mild soap and lukewarm water. You can find a cheaper deal if your lunch is a simple affair.;A smart way to take healthy food to work
84;155.0;5.0;5.0;3899;The Mr. Bento lunch-box is a great idea for anybody who doesn't like to leave their lunch in the fridge at work.  While the compartments look very small I was surprised at the amount of food they can hold.  If used properly it really does keep the hot foods hot and cold foods cold at the same time.  It cannot keep ice-cream frozen for 4 hours, but I really didn't expect it to.  The jar and the containers are very durable and should last a very long time.  Definitely worth the money.;Lunchbox of the Future
85;136.0;5.0;7.0;3908;I bought this item for my husband, who loves using it. I use the Zojirushi Ms. Bento Stainless Lunch Jar. So what do we love about these purchases? We pack our food around 8am and eat lunch at 1pm. The food is still warm! It preserves the heat as advertised. It also seals food, especially soup, wonderfully and keeps it hot. The compact containers are good for people on a diet. So far, we've been saving money because we've been eating out less.  Downside? Not dishwasher-safe. You have to handwash. But that's not a big deal if you consider how excellent Mr. & Ms. Bento are.;the little lunch jar that could
86;1.0;4.0;1914.0;3940;"It's a great ""lunchbox"" if you adapt your menu to it.\n\nFirst the description\n\nThe lunchbox is a Thermos Jar with a non-insulated plastic top. There are four containers that fit into the jar in a specific order.\n\n-The bottom container is a insulated bowl. It has a gasket sealed screw on top, insulated side walls and a small vent for pressure. The most insulative of the bunch it is designed for soup or other liquids\n\n-The next container is the biggest. It has a slide and lock insulated top.\n\n-The third container is notably smaller and has a Tupperware like pop top.\n\n-The fourth container is smaller yet and has the same top.\n\nYou stack the containers in the jar and then clip the top on with little side clips. The whole thing then goes in a nice nylon carry bag that also has a pair of chopsticks in a narrow plastic box. There are little pockets on the side for extra sauce packets or condiments (or I-pod video's to watch while your eating lunch).\n\nThis unit is optimally designed for the Japanese style lunch. A soup, Rice, entr&eacute;e and pickled/salted vegetables. Normally you'd put your soup in the bottom container, fill the middle container up with rice. Your entr&eacute;e would go in the third and the veggies in the fourth. Since the soup and the rice container both have insulated tops they stay warm. The other containers are not insulated and neither is the top. This allows some heat coming off the bottom two containers to escape so that your veggies are at room temperature. Understanding this is important. Its not supposed to keep the entire meal at the same temperature. Its supposed to keep one part hot and the other part at room temperature.\n\nI've found that in real use the soup container stays steaming hot. The stuff in the rice container stays warm (but not hot) the stuff in the top two containers heats up to room temperature, maybe a little bit more.\n\nNaturally you don't have to use it as designed (soup/rice/entr&eacute;e/veggie) but departures require a little bit adaptation and creativity. You need to balance both amounts and what you want to keep the hottest vs coolest. Also if you have access to a microwave at lunch it kind of makes this not quite as useful since you could just heat your food up there (as opposed to heating it up in the morning before you go). You could use the whole thing as a cooler (everything remains cold/cool till you heat up what you want). That might be a better way to go if your using it for the office.\n\nThe size of the room temperature containers is not large enough to handle American sized sandwiches and breads, so if your looking to take that traditional lunch box stuff this isn't the best unit for that.\n\nIf your looking to make the most of this unit you might check out some Bento Box cookbooks. They give receipies and menu sets more in line with what this is designed to handle. In particular I enjoyed the book ""Bento Boxes"" by Naomi Kijima\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bento-Boxes-Japanese-Meals-on-the-Go/dp/4889960732/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bento Boxes: Japanese Meals on the Go</a>\n\nI'll cook something up out of that and thrown in a packet of instant miso soup for a Japanese style lunch.\n\nPros-\n\nCompact and efficient use of space- It all goes in the tube, no bag full of different containers\n\nAllows for two temperatures in the same container - Allows for flexible combinations\n\nLots of interesting comments from your co-workers\n\nCons-\n\nCleanup is a bit of a pain - Not dishwasher safe. The soup top is a little tricky at times.\n\nSoft plastic will eventually pick up strong smells/Stains\n\nTwo temperatures in the same container - Requires a little creativity, doesn't keep everything uniformly hot/cold.\n\nConclusion-\n\nAs long as you understand how it works and adapt it's a great product. Might encourage you to cook a bit more healthy food and eat more vegetables.";Great product as long as you understand it
87;78.0;5.0;14.0;3942;I got this for work and school and I am so impressed. The top two containers are like tupperware and can hold things like fruit, veggies, etc. The larger container is NOT leakproof, it's made for rice but I put pasta and all sorts of stuff in it - just don't put things that might leak (and don't toss the luncbox around) and you should have no problems. The smaller container is leakproof and I usually put soup or chili in it. If I'm in a hurry and don't have time for breakfast sometimes I will put oatmeal in it. If you're a sandwich and chips person this is probably not the lunchbox to buy. If you're only waiting a few hours the food in the bottom stays warm but not hot. Be creative and you will love this lunchbox. One idea I had was to take the larger container and put taco fixing in it (beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes) and then packed a tortilla in the side pocket and it was really yummy! It's great for healthy eating and the portions are just right.;Very cool lunchbox!
88;79.0;5.0;14.0;3948;I purchased this item as a glorified lunch box to take to work with me - to save both money, and have a wider variety of different foods.  This container has definitely been worth its money so far.  Food can be prepared the evening before, and each compartment refrigerated separately.  In the morning, just toss all the compartments into the thermos and the food remains cold easily until lunch time.\n\nThe picture itself doesn't do the product justice.  As mentioned already, there are lids for each of the compartments, and the compartments are microwave safe.  The whole package is much larger than one may anticipate though, measuring around 6 inches tall, 4 inches in diameter not counting the carrying case. It's large enough to fit in pretty much any backpack, just expect it to take some space.  The actual carrying case has some handles to carry it not only in your hand but over your shoulder as well.\n\nI definitely recommend this product.  In the long run one will eat most likely somewhat healthier (especially if eating things like rice), and will save money.;Large volume of food on the go.
89;137.0;4.0;7.0;3969;The Zojirushi Mr. Bento Lunch Jar is a convenient and earth friendly way to carry a daily lunch to school or work.  I enjoy the four insert jars, they are easy to clean and fill with fresh food of most sizes.  The outer case can be chilled or heated (with hot water) to keep foods cold or warm until lunch time.  A drawback here:  all the jars would need to be either hot or cold, so I usually keep them cold to reheat whatever needs it later.  The canvas carry case is trendy and discreet.;Compact and Convenient Lunch Jar
90;156.0;4.0;5.0;3977;this is a great product. It keeps my meals warm and i can enjoy home cook meal at college;Great
91;157.0;5.0;5.0;3984;Simple...microwavable.  You don't need directions.  Foolproof product.  This lunchbox forces you to portion control and also to pack a variety of food items by the simple nature of it's design etc.\n\nIf you're on the fence.....go for it!;love it!
92;38.0;5.0;27.0;3995;"We're about a month into school lunches in the Mr. Bento, and we couldn't be happier.  The ""soup"" container and the ""locking lid"" container above it keep hot food hot for at least four hours (we haven't tested them longer than that yet).  I've sent soup, pasta, cut pieces of meat and vegetables--things that would never fly in a cold lunch--and my son gives me the thumbs up every time.\n\nNot having to use baggies, plastic wrap, foil or pre-portioned packages is great--both economically and ecologically.\n\nI do usually send a juice bag or juice box and have found that I can fit one easily by putting it right on top of the lunch jar, but within the fabric carrier . . . the drawstring closure holds the drink in place well.  If you had a plastic bottle or a 12 oz can of something, you'd probably have to pack it separately.\n\nThere is something about the Mr. Bento that lends itself to lunch-making enthusiasm, I must say.  Not only is it great to be able to use good leftovers and send ""real food"" for lunch, but my son and I have fun thinking of foods and combinations of foods to prep and pack.  My husband and I are considering buying Mr. Bentos for our lunches too (I guess we'll start saving up).\n\nYou can do cold items and hot items in the same lunch, but I put room temp items in one of the containers in between as a buffer.  One time I tried to send hot food in the soup container and cold slices of cheese in the container right above it.  The cheese got a bit melty, I hear.\n\nOne piece of input from my son (age 10) was for me not to crank the watertight lid closed so hard that he can't get it open.  It was only a problem once, but worth passing on a heads-up.\n\nI would definitely recommend the Mr. Bento.  And if you do buy it, check out the photos dedicated to Mr. Bento lunches on Flickr--very entertaining as well as a source for creative lunch ideas!";Does exactly what we hoped it would.
93;6.0;5.0;127.0;4000;I've had my Mr. Bento for a little over one year, and it's been a wonderful and handy lunchbox. It keeps food warm or cold as needed, doesn't leak, doesn't stain, doesn't absorb odors, and is relatively easy to clean. It helps immensely with portion sizes, makes packing a lunch actually fun (who knew?), and is just a pleasure to have. This is one purchase I definitely don't regret, and it was worth the price!\n\nEdit: I've now had this Mr. Bento for 10 years, and my above review holds true in every aspect. I still use this, and it still doesn't leak, stain, or stink, and cleans quite easily.;Wonderful
94;27.0;5.0;37.0;4016;Ever since the reports about the risks of chemicals leeching from plastics that have been microwaved, I've been wary of carrying microwaveable lunches to work. I was very happy to find this lunch jar. I chose to buy the Classic Lunch Jar instead of the four-container Mr. Bento because I wanted the larger volume, but I have found that the Classic Lunch Jar can hold more food than I can eat (I'm a woman who can put away a large prime rib for dinner, but not in need of huge quantities for lunch). The middle container for the Classic Lunch Jar, which stands about 3.5 inches deep and 4 inches wide, is cavernous, and can alone hold more than a modest dinnerplate's worth of food.\n\nI've found that putting soup into the bottom container is essential to keeping the middle container hot. It acts as the heat pack for the middle container. I usually heat canned soup in the morning in a pan, and pour it near-boiling into the container, and drop it into the bottom of the jar to start off. After 4 hours, the soup will still be too hot to eat!\n\nThen, for the middle container, I heat up some leftover starches (rice, potatoes, etc.) and some sort of entree. I put the starches on the bottom, and pile the entree on top. The lid of the middle container has a hollow space built in to insulate it from the top container. The food in the middle container is still quite hot after 4 hours.\n\nThe top container should be reserved for something that would be eaten at room temperature. I think it was designed that way, judging by the pictures on the packaging. I can't read Japanese, so I was only able to guess. The picture shaded the jar from red to orange to yellow to white, starting from the bottom, which accurately corresponds to the temperature of my food after 4 hours (red being hottest, white being room temp).\n\nI've tried putting an entree in the top container, to separate it from the starches, but it had cooled to near room temperature by the time I opened it 4 hours later. On the other hand, I've also put salad in there, and the salad was unmarred by the heat of the bottom containers after 4 hours.\n\nIf you're going to put cold food into the top container, I would recommend that you leave the top inch of the middle container empty as a heat buffer.\n\nThe only awkward thing about the container is that the soup container has a rubber ring gasket and a tiny dime-sized rubber vent cover, both of which need to be popped off and cleaned after each use. Otherwise, gunk will get into the gaps and get really gross. I've found that sticking the pointy end of the chopstick into the gasket groove will pry the thing out easily, and the valve cover is easy enough to take off. My only concern is that I swear that I'm going to lose or break either of them one day soon. But if that's the secret to being able to keep soup boiling hot for hours in a container that screws shut without leaking, then I'm willing to put in the extra effort.\n\nNeedless to say, I love this lunch jar, and would recommend it to anyone.\n\nCheck out the Zojirushi Lunch Jar fan club in Flickr. People have posted pictures of their lunches each day for all to admire. It's entitled Mr. Bento Porn.;Keeping food hot and cold at once
95;110.0;5.0;9.0;4019;I bought this for myself and I love it. Only the bottom two containers keep the temperature, the top two go to room temperature. Anyone who complains hasn't read the directions. This kept my salad today nice and fresh.;Absolutely Awesome
96;111.0;5.0;9.0;4022;I love this product!  Its compact and handy, the portion control is great, I haven't had issues with leaks as long as I use the correct container, tt keeps hot things hot and cold things cold and it comes with chopsticks!  Its perfect!;Best Lunch Container I've Ever Used
97;121.0;5.0;8.0;4023;This was purchased for my husband at christmas. He's a big guy and has twice mentioned that there was too much food for him in it!\n\nWashes easily, and would definitely recommend.;What more can I say
98;90.0;5.0;12.0;4023;I bought the initial box a few months back and it is awesome. Some people have complained on this site regards leaks. Let me tell you something. I sometimes take soup in the soup container. I keep the whole box on the passenger side while I drive. Breaking hard a few times or taking corners the things fell on the on the floor of the car. But nothing leaked. Not even a drop. So not sure what these people are talking about. They must be absolute morons and not closed the lid properly!\n\nMy wife bought one more for herself and buying another for our daughter. Absolutely the best. However I see Amazon has increased the price quite a bit since I first brought it.;Awesome product - buying more of these
99;122.0;5.0;8.0;4024;I have been using for about a month.  No spills yet.  Food always piping hot (after about 4 hours).  It encourages me to eat heathful food every day!  Having soup for lunch really is quite nice.\n\nOn the downside (I knew this before I bought...but even so):  the dishes should dishwasher friendly (they are microwaveable).  They are easy to clean though and I sue it every day.\n\nOverall, good quality, easy to use and a little fun too!;Very good overall
100;91.0;5.0;12.0;4025;I live in Japan as I am currently stationed here in the military. I  bought 3 of these.  I love them, especially the portion control factor.\n\nHate to tell you guys this, but the Zojirushi Mr. Bento is only 2450 Yen, or $22.00 US dollars.  I can't believe they are being sold in the States for double and triple the price!  Still, it's worth every penny and a good conversation starter.;Lunch Jars Are Cheap in Japan
101;112.0;5.0;9.0;4025;I have only been using this for a little over a week, and I am already in love with this Mr. Bento. I would just hit Wendy's or the lame cafeteria for my lunch, but with this I can bypass that and bring all my goodies from home. I would like to bring lunches from home, but would get aggrivated with containers, finding a bag to put it all in, and leakage. With Mr. Bento I am free from all of that hassle. I normall pack a main dish, a side, like soup or some noodles, some veggies, and a little snack. It keeps me satisified throughout my 8-10 hour workday.\n\nI been looking at this for the longest time and finally purchased it when I saw it was on Sale through Amazon. It has already paid for itself with just a week of use. I would normally spend 5-6 dollars on lunch...eating yucky food. Now I have my delicious meals with things I like to eat at my hand.\n\nIf you're contemplating it, just spurge and get it, I assure you that it's worth it!;Best investment for myself!!!
102;113.0;4.0;9.0;4026;Mr Bento is pricey, but it pays for itself after a week. I have saved so much money since I started taking my lunch to work and Mr Bento just makes it easier and fun. No more crushed food sitting in the backpack. And after weeks of eating good homecooked food, I wonder how I could have possibly enjoyed the drab food I was eating at the food court(trough) in our high rise. I have packed hot soup in Mr Bento and have not had problems with spilling. I am careful to hold it upright - easy to do with the handles. And I do preheat the containers when packing hot foods. For cold foods, I pack the night before and leave it in the fridge until I go to work. I keep it at my desk and things stay hot or cold. I have not been sucessful with mixed hot things and cold things. Although I have run across some tips on how to do that it hasn't worked well for me. It seems very well constructed - I have dropped it a few times and it doesn't seem to have affected it at all. It is somewhat large but it is compact and holds a lot of food. I get enough food packed for lunch and a mid morning snack. It could fit into a decent sized backpack but I carry it separately to make sure it stays upright. I did get the Japanese version with the chopsticks and holder and instructions in japanese, but you can download the manual from their website - here's the link:\n\n[...]\n\nAlso, there's a group devoted to Mr Bento if you ever need some ideas on what to pack and how - just do a search for mrbento on flickr to see great photos of packed Mr Bentos.;Great money saver.

104;84.0;5.0;13.0;4034;"Most of the negative reviews I read of this item before I bought it turned out to be from people who didn't read the instructions.  (Or didn't get the English version of the insructions with their Mr. Bento.)  Most of the bowls are not intended to hold liquids and will leak if used improperly.\n\nMe, I love it! Convenient, easy to cary, good for portion control.\n\nMy use: Little soup bowl - milk for my breakfast.  Large thermal bowl - lunch perishables (turkey, cheese, whatever).  Large plain bowl - Kashi cereal, ready to pour the milk! Small plain bowl, raw veggies to go with lunch.  Bag chopstick pocket also holds fork and spoon.  Tortillas or pitas can go in the bag, around the lunch jar (in plastic or wax paper, of course).  Outside pocket holds protien bar and a bottle of water.  Orange fits in the bag on top of the jar, then pull drawstring to hold it.  Pack the whole thing the night before and leave in the fridge - grab n go at 5:30 in the morning; by 11:00, lunch items are still cold because the entire jar was chilled.";Read the instructions!
105;72.0;5.0;16.0;4042;The little compartments are great for packing an amazing variety of dishes in a compact space. My co-workers are in awe at what I unpack each day: salads, fruit, yogurt, soups, rice, pasta, hummus, nuts, curry, steamed veggies. The food doesn't really stay hot though, since the container is not airtight - it is not quite a thermos, though it does provide a bit of insulation - enough for maybe a couple of hours. At least the containers are microwavable (without the lids). Do wish a handle was included on the container - it's a bit slippery to grasp when out of its carrying bag. Overall, makes lunchtime great fun.;eating healthy on the go
106;138.0;5.0;7.0;4043;Foods stay warm/cold and the serving size is just right and appropriate if you are watching your food intake.  I love it and had recommended it to my daughter as well...It's worth the price.;Excellent purchase

108;46.0;5.0;24.0;4050;"I am so excited to find this product for my two children's school lunches.  They are 13 and 12 and we are really trying to eat healthy.  The final straw for me was eating a school lunch with my kids one day last semester and they had FRIED BROCCOLI!!!  I couldn't believe the school system was calling this improved healthy eating!  My kids wanted to take their lunches, but didn't want to always have a cold sandwich, they wanted a HOT lunch.  THIS ITEM REALLY WORKS!  I have been packing them HOT and COLD items in the 4 containers and their friends have been amazed when they open up their lunch and IT IS STEAMING after being packed for 6 1/2 hours! I can finally send my kids off with healthy, home-made food (to which their friends are saying ""I wish my Mom would send my lunch. That looks so good"").  I find myself looking at the clock during their lunch times and smiling because I know what they are eating and I'm thrilled when I pick them up and ask how was lunch and they are say ""MMMM good, MOM Thanks!""  Then I don't mind getting up at 5:30 and fixing both their lunch and breakfasts because the gratification of knowing they are eating healhty and feeling loved is PRICELESS!\n\nThe tricks I had read about really work, I put boiling water into the containers I want to stay hot and the outer container, and ice in the containers I want to stay cold and let them sit while I prepare the food.  Then I make sure that the hot food is steaming hot before I pack it up in the preheated containers.  Same for cold items being chilled before packing.  As soon as the kids get home, they empty out their lunch containers and put into a sink of soapy water, I wash and put into the disk rack and everything's ready for the next morning!";FINALLY! Healthy School Lunches for my kids!
109;85.0;2.0;13.0;4063;I followed all instructions including filling container\n\nwith hot water to warm it before packing lunch. Everything\n\nwas cold to room temperature 3 hours later. Nothing here to\n\njustify the high price or the amount of work to clean this thing. A big waste. Stick to heating your lunch in the microwave folks.;Extremely disappointing
110;43.0;5.0;25.0;4090;I've been using my Mr. Bento four times a week since I purchased it about five months ago and it's been a great investment. Not only have I saved money because of the meals I've able to prepare frugally and deliciously at home, but have found it great for portion control. Also - and one of the main reasons I purchased it - the thermal capacity of the outside shell enables me to *not* need to refrigerate it when I go into the office in the morning.  Mr. Bento sits on my desk for five hours and keeps the food I carry in it fresh and ready for consumption.\n\nStaining has been an issue for some users, but I've found lining the bowls I use for soup/hot foods with a touch of either vegetable or olive oil prevents this well enough.\n\nLeakage has been another issue, but I've never filled any of the containers to capacity and carry Mr. Bento upright when transporting it to work. It has not been an issue for me because I've carried it in this fashion. All in all, I highly recommend this lunch jar.;Practical, useful and a great investment!
111;31.0;2.0;31.0;4106;I was given Mr. Bento as a gift last summer. I was so excited! I bring a lunch to work every day, and I thought Mr. Bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well-organized, balanced, and easy-to-carry lunch. You can imagine my dismay when the Mr. Bento containers leaked day after day. Anything remotely soft came out from the containers, which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way. Cute? Yes. Impress your co-workers? Yes. But practical? No.;Seems practical, but...
112;18.0;5.0;52.0;4110;"I love mine - of course it is going to take some prep work, but the idea for me wasn't ""quick and easy"" otherwise I would continue going through fast food!\n\nTips for keeping things hot - I am not a huge fan of soup for lunch, so I don't use the small soup bowl for that.  Instead, in the morning when I am putting together my lunch (I don't store my food in the lunchbox overnight) I place boiling water in both insulated bowls.  This preheats the larger bowl for my heated food (which is being heated in the microwave) and I seal up the hot water in the smaller bowl.  It goes on the bottom - and since heat rises, it helps keep the larger bowl warm too!  I then have warm water to rinse off my silverware or fingers after lunch ;)  If I don't have to worry about wilting a salad or something else, then I even will preheat the main container that all the bowls go into.  If I am concerned about wilting, I might place a paper napkin between the ""hot"" bowls and the cold bowls.  I bet that if you were doing an ""all cold"" lunch, you could put ice in the top bowl (since cold air sinks), and prep the bowls ahead of time by using ice or ice cold water.\n\nBy using this method, my lunch is still at temperatures I find acceptable by noon, when I prep the food around 6:30 AM or 7:00 AM.";Works great if you do some prep work
113;159.0;5.0;5.0;4117;I carry it to work everyday.  I enjoy to have soup, main dish, and side separately contained in one jar.  It's easy to clean.  It's a quality product.  No problem up to this point.;Nice Product

Because of the working conditions, I really hate to use the microwave and refuse to even consider the fridge. Of course I was happy to get a new lunchbox that would address these issues.\n\nI have found mixed results keeping food hot (6 hours). The best I have found is to pour boiling water in the outside sleeve, cap, and let sit for 10 minutes. I microwave the food in the bowls (no lids) until hot, then quickly assemble everything.  This keeps my food warm...and again I am talking about 6 hours. I have yet to try it for a cold lunch.\n\nThe Amazon description says you can use just the sleeve - but that is specifically against the directions - which did come in English. I have not tried it - the inside is not stainless and I do not want to mess it up. I have tried to use the containers for a variety of foods - with mixed results. It is best to use as it was designed with rice, veggie and meat - each in their own little dish. I know the containers are small - but I have yet to be hungry after lunch, and I have a large appetite.  One thing I like is this forces me to do a healthier portion control than is normal for me. I use the lid for a bowl and mix in ingredients from the bowls. If you are trying to take a single item (like soup or casserole) this is not going to work for you. I find that I use it several days a week and then take a different lunch bag the other days when I take a different style lunch.\n\nAfter living with it for several months now, I would buy it again.\n\nI did buy a Boker Snacpac flatware set - it fits perfectly in the chopstick holder loop, and comes in a protected container. First time in years I have had REAL flatware!;Great at what it does - but with limits
116;19.0;4.0;50.0;4145;"Unlike many reviewers for this product, I'm a dedicated bring-your-own lunch person -- I've been making my own lunches since college. I used to bring lunch in a Ziploc bag or sealed plastic container, and for a while I had a lightly-insulated soft lunch""box"". Usually I didn't have trouble, but sometimes things would leak or get squashed. When I started riding my bike to work and going all over the place on public transit, I really wanted something that would never leak out of its container, and would be easy to carry in a backpack or by hand. I also needed something that would hold quite a bit of food because I tend to get hungry in the afternoon and eating work-supplied popcorn and soda is not how I want to get my calories.\n\nSo far I've been very happy with the Mr. Bento container. It's easy to carry -- it fits right into my backpack, which my lunchbox and many plastic containers were a bit too wide for. I can also easily carry it in hand if I am walking from the train to work -- it is not uncomfortably heavy. It holds enough food for a big lunch and a snack.  I've packed soup several times, as well as foods with some liquid (like fruit cobbler -- yum!) in the smaller side containers, and everything stays clean and inside the container. A bagel even fits whole into the main container and makes a great side with soup.\n\nI tried the insulating properties the first day that I used it and wasn't incredibly impressed. My soup was still quite warm but not hot and other containers were not that warm. However, it's possible that I just did not prepare the jar or the food properly. Since I am pressed for time in the morning, but not at lunchtime, and I have access to a microwave, I usually just heat my food at work, and haven't tried the insulation since then. I don't microwave food in the bowls, although it says you can if you leave the lids off, because I have had bad luck in the past with various plastic containers getting a little ""cooked"" (crisp and bubbly) in the microwave, so I just don't heat stuff in plastic anymore. We have plenty of bowls at work, luckily.\n\nAn unforeseen benefit is that I am getting excited about packing my lunches again. When I started out making my lunch I put more work into it, but I got bored after a while and started just grabbing some leftovers and maybe some fruit for work, or just a sandwich and fruit. Now I am willing to get up a little earlier and cut up fruit or veggies and prepare something for the side, so I get more variety, which also means I am more satisfied and better nourished. I love to unpack my lunch and look at all my food before I settle down to eat. I am excited about learning to do some true bento-style lunches in the future too, and maybe even using it for breakfast on the go!\n\nI highly recommend this lunchbox for anyone who's serious about bringing lunch to work or school, and especially anyone who already does, but wants to make lunch fun again. I would have given it five stars except for three things:\n\n- The soup container is too small and there is no other option for something that's mostly liquid. I sometimes like a lot of soup at lunchtime and I can't do that with this box.\n- The temperature maintenance did not impress me right away.\n- The containers are not dishwasher safe. This doesn't matter to me since I don't have a dishwasher, but it is a big deal for a lot of people.\n[Update 11/20/06] - The metallic finish on the outside of the jar is ""painted"" and can be scratched. This just happened to me recently and I wish they had just left it plain; I am worried now that all the paint will peel off. But this is purely cosmetic.\n[Update 12/20/07] - No more scratches have appeared un the finish, and I am still using and loving my Mr. Bento nearly every day. However, I have gotten a bit bored of making lunch again!\n\nBut overall, it is a quality product and excellent way to bring satisfying lunches with you when you travel. I am still loving it and using it nearly every day more than a month after the original review date. Friends I have given it to as a gift have also raved about it!";Very effective lunch container
117;14.0;5.0;59.0;4169;"So I bought some of these for some friends...  I'm a chef and I make lunches on a daily basis for a number of people; they were looking for something that was a bit ""out of the ordinary"" to carry their ""extraordinary"" lunches to work or back to a desk.  Now, by playing up to my culinary vanity they, of course, got exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe breakdown: This ""bento"" comes with a soup bowl, a rice bowl, a large bowl and a small bowl.  The soup bowl has an airtight lid with a valve to allow steam to escape and keep the lid on.  The rice bowl has a screw-on lid but it is not airtight.  The large and small bowls each have a snap-on lid similar to other plastic kitchen storage items.  The bowls are microwave safe but I don't recommend microwaving the lids.  All items, including the shell, are easily maintained and easy to wash.\n\nWith four bowls the possibilities are almost endless.  You could produce a...\n\nbreakfast bento\n  Milk in the ""soup"" bowl, cereal in the ""rice"" bowl, fruit in the ""large"" bowl and some sugar or other topping in the ""small"" bowl.\n\nFrench bento\n  Potato and leek soup in the ""soup"" bowl, rice pilaf in the ""rice"" bowl, sauteed green beans with onions and almonds in the large bowl and sliced duck breast in the ""small"" bowl.\n\nThe nicest feature of this product is its size; it's just the right amount of food for a substantial and healthy lunch; provided you don't fill the bowls with M&M's....";Fabulous for so many reasons...

I ate my lunch 4 and a half hours after packing it and there was still steam comming from the food.  To be honest I was shocked, I completely expected it to be at best a little above room temperature.  This really is a quality product and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  Before stumbling upon this product I was paying over 6 dollars a day for food, those days are long gone.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who would like to have home cooked HOT food for lunch everyday.;An Excellent Product...
119;28.0;5.0;37.0;4177;If you want to keep your food steaming hot for hours.  Fill the soup bowl, rice bowl, and outer container (only halfway for the outer container) with * boiling water * and replace the lids on the soup/rice bowls and place a kitchen towel over the outer container.  In the meantime, heat your food in the microwave using your own plates/bowls.  It's even better when the food you're going to pack is freshly cooked and straight from the stovetop.  Let hot water sit for 5 minutes in the soup/rice bowls then discard.  Fill your soup/rice bowls first with the hot food then\nthrow away the hot water in the outer container.\n Wipe outer container dry.  Place bowls immediately inside and stack accordingly to retain the heat.\n\nFor maximum heat retention, if you're not packing soup, fill the soup bowl with boiling water only and just use the rice bowl for your food. (My children tell me that they could actually see the steam come out of their bowl when they first open it.)  That's 5 hours later!  I have emptied the water from the soup bowl 8 hours later and it's still hot.\nI don't microwave the inner bowls at all even if it says I could.\n\nDo not soak.  Wash by hand and dry the parts immediately.  No Dishwashers!\n\nTomato paste will stain the inner bowls.  The stain will eventually come off.  Just pour boiling hot water into the bowls and let it sit there for 5 minutes.  Repeat as needed.  I read that applying a little bit of cooking oil in the bowls before filling with tomato-based food works.\n\nThe top 2 containers are for cold foods only.  To separate the temperature between the hot and cold containers, you can place a small, new/clean, trimmed-to-fit kitchen towel (this is the most effective).\n\nAdvantages:\n\nHot food, saves money, it's true you'll be envied, fun, cute, my husband/children love having warm, home cooked meals,  Amazon did an excellent job with shipping the items to us,  I feel good getting our money's worth.\n\nDisadvantages:  Cleaning, but it only takes me less than 5 minutes.  What's 5 minutes of my time?  It's all for love.\n\n***UPDATE\nNovember 2012 It's a great product. We still use them.;A Keeper
120;35.0;3.0;30.0;4183;Mr. Bento looks pretty good coming out of the box and has, indeed, encouraged me to make/bring my own lunches more often but I guess I had higher hopes.  My main concern is that all but one of the containers leak if the box is somehow tilted onto its side ... say in a back pack or on the floor of a car.  I've needed paper towels on hand ever time I've used it so far.\n\nI still use it but wish it were of a little higher quality.;Cool but not cool enough
121;63.0;5.0;18.0;4193;Man, this system has changed my whole approach to lunch.  First, Mr. Bento is super-cute.  All of my coworkers think it's awesome.  Second, I am so psyched to pack my lunch now.  All of the pieces fit together nicely and I don't have a bunch of container lids lying around cupboard corners.  Finally, my portion sizes are perfect and my meals are balanced and pretty.  All in all, it is perfect and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to maximize his or her lunch potential.  Now, at this point you might think I'm being dramatic, but OH NO!  Mr. Bento ROCKS.  'Nuf said.;Domo arigato Mr. Bento!
122;96.0;5.0;11.0;4201;Use it just about everyday for lunch on the go. For maintaining temperatures this item is excellent.;A handy product.
123;36.0;3.0;30.0;4233;This is a great idea, but unfortunately for me it's not very practical. I walk a couple miles up and down hills to work every day and the Mr. Bento is just too heavy, even without food in it. I'm sure the stainless steel is good for keeping food at the right temperature, but it makes me never want to use it because I dread carrying it. If you drive to work or school, it would work fine.;Wish it wasn't so heavy
124;23.0;4.0;47.0;4257;I like to eat healthy home cooked food when travelling and for such occassions, Mr. Bento is great. The quality of this product is fantastic, as is the case with all Zojirushi products I own. It's nice they have started to offer instructions in English. Mine were Japanese only and unfortunately I didn't know that you're not supposed to microwave with the lids on or put containers in the dish washer. Many thanks to the reviewer who shared those notes.\n\nThe insulation on this product is great. It'll keep food warm for more than 4 hours - I've enjoyed warm meals during long plane flights with the bento. It may not keep things hot, but certainly warm. It can also, alternatively, keep things cool.\n\nInterestingly, the lid of the device is thin plastic and is not insulated, so, the insulation is most effective in the lower compartments which traditionally would hold soup and rice.\n\nI have had some challenges trying to have both warm and cold items. The ability to keep chilled is great if you make a meal the night before, put it in the fridge, then use the keep cold capability to keep food cool for the commute to work, then warm the food at work. However, the lack of insulation at the top, for example, may allow hot food to get cold on a cold day or cold items (like a fresh salad) to get hot on a hot day. Hot and cold together is likewise a major challenge as the heat from the lower items will cause the upper items to get warm - again, making it quite difficult to have a hot item with a salad.\n\nNot suprisingly, the Mr. Bento seems best suited for the traditional Japanese type of meal - soup in the bottom, rice in the next level, and some pickled vegetables eaten at room tempurature above that. For such a configuration, it works perfectly, but for some more American-style meals there can be challenges.\n\nThe use of plastic for the containers is unfortunate because it's porous. That means the containers may take on the color and smell and flavor of the foods placed in them, particularly if the food is strong like a rich indian curry, for example. Also, when heating the foods or placing hot foods, various toxic and cancer causing chemicals from the plastic may leech into the food. It would therefore be really nice if this could be made with stainless steel containers instead of plastic.\n\nThis review is intended to give a feeling for some aspects of the Bento. All challenges and concerns aside, I've had my Mr. Bento for several years and am always grateful for it becuase it makes it possible to carry food in a very convenient way and thereby to eat well when travelling!;Essential Tool for Healthy Food on The Go
125;69.0;1.0;17.0;4262;Once I finally got a set of directions on the products use I read them and followed them exactly. The food was barely warm only a couple of hours after it was packed. I am sorry I purchased it as it was a complete waste of money. Avoid this product.;A terrible waste of money!!
126;160.0;4.0;5.0;4262;My only complaint with this product was that it came with only chopsticks. I know this is a Japanese product, but I would have thought that for US sales they might have thought to include travel utensils. Also, as others have pointed out, the instructions for this came only in Japanese. But seeing as how the only thing I really needed to know was the high end of temperature that this can take, I was okay with the lack of directions for this.;Great product
127;58.0;5.0;20.0;4267;I just had to have this lunchbox.  My work has a so-so cafeteria, but I prefer to bring my own.  My department shares a little bitty fridge so I thought I could use this item and store my lunch under my desk.  I eat 6 hours after I pack, sometimes later and I don't have a temperature problem.  I do follow the rule of either all hot or all cold.  You can't mix with this design.  For hot it helps if you fill the outer container with hot tap water for 5 minutes before packing.  For cold I just store overnight in my fridge.\n\nYou don't have to eat Asian every day to benefit from this box.  The only restriction is the largest container (for rice) is not watertight, so I use it for either lettuce or chips.  Sometimes I pack dinner leftovers.  Other times I pack sandwich fillers and pack my bread separately so I can make a fresh sandwich at the lunch table.  I've even used it to bring all sorts of fruits and veggies so I can graze all day.  It works as a compact vessel for a picnic lunch too.\n\nA drawback is that the containers are plastic.  I'm afraid to put them in the microwave or dishwasher for fear of ruining my expensive lunchbox.;My coworkers are JEALOUS!
128;8.0;5.0;109.0;4340;"This lunch jar is the best thing to happen to lunch since the peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  In fact, it's even BETTER than PB&J because it will accomodate much healthier food!  I was fortunate enough to receive this as a gift, but I would've bought it in a second had I known how quickly it would pay for itself.  I brought my lunch to work in this jar today, in fact.  On the menu: homemade asparagus/leek soup, tomato-saffron stewed chicken over spaghetti squash, cucumber and bell pepper chopped salad, and some raw almonds.  Food like that has takeout and vending machine fare beat hands down.  I've saved myself a small fortune in fast food costs since I started taking my lunch in this jar, and I've lost weight because I'm eating better.\n\nI have had no problems with leaking dishes, not even when I have consomme or other really ""runny"" soup.  The dishes are good quality and have stood up well to three months of almost constant use.  The only caveat I'd offer is to avoid tomato soup.  I tried that once, and it stained the inside of my soup bowl orange.  Dishes made with fresh or canned tomatoes, however, do not stain the dishes, so bring on the pasta with marinara sauce without worry.\n\nThe carrying bag is very convenient; I just sling it over my shoulder along with my workbag.  There's enough room in it to tote along a few healthy snacks, too -- essential for those days when you know you'll be in the office for 12 hrs or longer.\n\nMy only complaint is that lettuce-based salads do not hold up well when packed with an otherwise warm lunch.  The ""rice"" bowl has a thick, insulated lid, but it's not enough to keep the heat in the jar from rising and affecting the food in the top two dishes.  Raw veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, grape tomatoes, and baby carrots can survive that sort of treatment in better shape, though even they will be rather warmish if you've packed hot soup and a hot entree.  The flip side of that, however, is that the jar holds heat brilliantly.  My lunch has waited for me for as long as 7 hours before, and even then, the soup was still steaming and my main dish was still piping hot.\n\nI absolutely, unreservedly recommend this product to anyone who is willing to spend the time necessary to prepare delicious, healthy food to take to work or school.  Do NOT let the sticker price chase you away; it is absolutely worth every cent.";Brilliant!  Will pay for itself in no time.
129;32.0;5.0;31.0;4344;"I bought this for my husband so he could take yummy food to work. I would've bought it for myself, but I work at home now and had no excuse. He says he absolutely loves it. The containers are the perfect size to eat throughout the day. Since he's really busy at work, there is not time for sitting down and having a long lunch. since it also keeps the food cold or warm, he doesn't have to put it in the refrigerator when he gets to work, so it's always at his desk ""ready for eating"" when he gets a chance. Since there are 4 containers, I usually put a serving of fruit, one salad and the other two I reserve for the ""main dishes"". I haven't put in any soup yet, and I think that liquids do leak a little from the soup container. But there hasn't been a major disaster yet. We love it!";Excellent Product
130;45.0;1.0;25.0;4345;It just doesn't function as it should be keeping the food warm in the winter.  It just doesn't work. Maybe the warmth last two hours after pack?  I don't like microwave heated food, so I decided to have one of this.  But now I end up using the microwave again. :- {  What a waist of money.;Not Warm And Waist of money
131;53.0;4.0;22.0;4348;i recently purchased this item for $50 the price is a little steep, but it definately is quality stuff. it does what it says. it will keep food for hours and cold stuff longer. i found that if i wanted to keep frozen microwavable foods in the container and put the container in the fridge, it will be cold for at least 6hrs!\n\nthe portion size is just right. i would prefer to have more, but this will keep me intact not to eat more. for those people that might need alot of food, this is not for you. no heavy meals here. the only thing that i did not like, was that the soup container was a bit small. i end up just putting other foods there that might spill.\n\nthe other containers were spill proof also, but they don't mention it. it is as tight as a tupperware container. ive enjoyed this product and would recomend this to brown baggers. they don't mention the chopstick that are included...nice bonus.;a must for brown baggers
132;82.0;5.0;14.0;4352;"This is the best lunch box I have ever used. I use it almost every day. And, it's not just for Japanese food, rice or soups. I use it to bring all sorts of snacks plus dishes for lunch. I fill the smaller containers with trail mix, crakers, carrots, and all sorts of healthy snack, and I use the one big one for the ""main dish."" Not to mention how much money I am saving by eating my own food instead of going out and buying lunch every day!\n\nIt has withstood the test of the microwave and the dishwasher. No spills yet - all of the containers screw or snap securely. Stack the coolest things at the bottom and they will stay cool almost all day. I often pack it up at night and stick it in the fridge so I can just grab it and go in the morning. I use the microwave at work to reheat.\n\nThe carry case is sturdy and well put together too, plus it has a shoulder strap. It looks way more hip than a brown bag! Plus, for all you recycle buffs, it is reusable, so not more plastic trash every day. I definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to bring all of their food to work with them. If you are on a special diet, it keeps you from raiding the snack machine!";Coolest lunch box!

134;97.0;5.0;11.0;4359;I love this product! I bought it for my fiancee so that he would start taking his lunch to work. So far it's been a month and he's been carrying this thing to work everyday. He says that it garners looks and questions from others at work, at how neat it is packaged. I just love how well it allows you to bring a balanced and delicious meal. He has even admitted that it's much yummier to eat this lunch, as opposed to eating out where the food is too heavy. Look for Mr. Bento on Flickr. Evidently it's created quite the stir!;Mr. Bento!
135;95.0;5.0;12.0;4372;This is such a convenient little device. The insulated compartments keep things the right temperature for a pretty good, long time. I haven't had a leak with either the bottom (o-ring seal) container or the second (screw-on lid) container. I've found that meal portion size is easy to manage with this lunchbox/bento. You can even use the large container to cut your sandwiches into rounds, if you like. It also comes with a pair of sequestered, little chopsticks. They have their own case and fit inside of the pouch. If you want to take another item that doesn't quite fit in the compartments, the bag has lots of pouches to hold other items. I bought husband one and liked it so much, I bought myself one too.;Forget your square lunchbox
136;98.0;5.0;11.0;4374;The only obstacle I have is finding food the kids enjoy to put in each of the containers.  The sizes are small, but I think this is what is needed for our children today.  I just need to re-evaluate what appropriate portion size is.;Works as stated
137;70.0;5.0;17.0;4379;I have several Zojirushi products and all are rock-solid.  I've used this item and it lives up to the company's name.  I would not hesitate to buy this item, and indeed I ordered another one through Amazon.  Only problem is that was several weeks ago and I still don't have it.  As a bonus, J-Life International, Inc., the vendor that Amazon ships through, cancelled my order today.  They had no qualms about collecting my money but somehow getting the product to me was too much for them to handle.\n\nLove the product and would recommend it  as soon as Amazon finds a reliable vendor.;Great item - but be careful who you buy from . . .

139;42.0;3.0;26.0;4386;There is nothing that beats having hot soup is a winter parking lot.  The need for an insulated and compartmentalized food container drove me to buy this product.  However, for its price, the design can be more versatile.  Here are a few things I want to point out:\n\n- The top two containers are for cold food only. I once put hot water in there, which later had a plastic taste.\n\n- The hot food in the lower containers would warm up the cold food on the top a bit.  After all, they share the same insulated space.\n\n- The biggest bowel, which is the rice bowel, is not water proof.  The sauces and juices can leak.\n\n- The soup bowel can be bigger, since I like soup.  Its lid can be very hard to twist open.\n\n- There is no handle on the jar, nor a place to hold utensils.  Being so big, carrying it without the outer bag requires two hands.  The bag has both.  However, many times I wish I can get rid of the bag, which makes it a hassle to open and close the jar, not to mention that it brings more messy presence to the scene of eating.;Great Concept,  Need More  Versatile Design
140;140.0;3.0;7.0;4393;however, it's not too great in terms of keeping food warm or cold. In particular, if you have foods of different temperatures in the Jar, everything will take on the warm temperatute. It does come in handy, but if you want a thermos to keep your food hot or cold for quite some time, I wouldn't recommend this.;Great to carry breakfast, lunch and dinner to work..
141;29.0;5.0;34.0;4397;Mr. Bento has probably saved my life, or at least extended it considerably.  I'm used to eating fast food for lunch everyday, the whole office decides where to go and that always means fast food.  Well now they all roll their eyes at me when I bring in my healthy home cooked japanese lunch in my Mr. Bento.  I can't believe how much better I feel now that I'm using Mr. Bento for my lunch!  It's so convenient.  Perfectly sized bowls, I think if you feel the need to eat more than a Mr. Bento sized lunch.. you might want to limit yourself!  I posted the manual, so hopefully amazon will have that soon.\n\n[...]\n\nThe bottom container (mainly for rice) is great at keeping it hot.  If you put the colder things on top, they stay reasonably cool.  The manual suggests pouring hot water in the container to heat it up, then pouring it out before loading it with the individual containers.  I've heard people put it in the freezer if they want to keep all cool products in it.  But I don't think this is really good enough to keep things cool.  I'd love to see a Mr. Bento that can keep hot and cold food truly hot and cold at the same time.\n\nOverall though, it's a great product.  With the way we eat fast food, and how our kids eat school lunches...  maybe it's time to get a Mr. Bento.\n\nIt's perfect for a healthier lifestyle.\n\n(There is also a Ms. Bento with 2 bowls, and a Classic with 3 bowls.);Forget Fast Food!!
142;64.0;5.0;18.0;4418;Lunch is fun with Mr. Bento!  I echo all of the comments listed below.  I would add that I do not eat rice daily and at first the rice container seemed useless for non-dry items.  I like to put a can of veggies in that container, but the juice leaks and pools at the bottom of the vacuum canister.  With a small sheet of press and seal wax paper, my mess goes away.\n\nA nice, new tool for lunch time eating solutions!  No more mis-matched containers or unhealthy fast food meals.  Mr. Bento will pay for itself in just a few weeks.;Revolutionizing my lunch hour
143;99.0;5.0;11.0;4429;I received a Mr. Bento for Christmas. I have carried it to work for three days now.  Not only does it keep food warm and cool, one can carry a variety of food in a compact container. Additionally, it promotes healthy portion sizes.  It's definitely a tool for healthy eating.  That alone makes it worth the price - or pack your lunch for two weeks and it will pay for itself.  Well made too - in fact, I just ordered the slightly more expensive 3 bowl model for someone as a gift.;Just Love It!
144;25.0;5.0;41.0;4431;I have lived in Japan for almost 4 years now, and they never cease to amaze me with all the small and highly useful items they make here...but on to the lunch jar...\n\nThis thing is great. Really. My jaw dropped when my wife came home from the store with it one day...I just wish now that I had looked on Amazon to save $15.\n\nI am lucky that my wife is Chinese and can read most of the directions on it that are in Japanese. However, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Use the bottom, curved bowl for soups/wet items\n\n- Use the large one above it for meats, salads, rice, or\n\n  combinations that don't really run\n\n- Use the next two for fruit cocktails, chips, salsa, nachos,\n\n  etc.\n\n- Microwave OPEN, not closed.\n\nIt doesn't spill very easily (you can accidentally knock it over with no problem), but I wouldn't recommend leaving it lying on its side on your car seat until lunch or other long periods of time. :)\n\nIt is very easy to wash, fits together like a small puzzle, and has little nooks and things where you can put knives, forks, spoons, chopsticks, and napkins or what-have-you. Like the product description says, if you don't need to use the containers inside, you can take them out and use as-is.\n\nI highly recommend getting this, especially if your kids keep complaining about the squished jelly sandwiches and bad apple slices. :);The Japanese have done it again!
145;7.0;3.0;128.0;4434;I returned this item because I discovered that it is not suitable for dairy items.  I imagine this is because the outer shell is not thermally insulated.  Only the two plastic bottom containers for soup/rice have insulation for hot items and I didn't see any thermal insulation for keeping the cold items at refrigerated temperature.  This limits you to items that won't spoil at room temperature.\n\nI am also wary of plastics that claim to be microwaveable yet can't be put through the dishwasher.  Per the instruction manual, unless scrupulously cleaned by hand this plastic can absorb odors.\n\nThe instruction manual advised the outer shell container be kept absolutely dry or rusting may occur.  So much for stainless steel.;Has limitations

148;21.0;5.0;49.0;4529;"my 4 year old son was homeschooled pretty much since he was 18m. so i was a bit worried how he would handle ""school food"". he won't eat cold foods unless we're hiking or something (then he feels he's ""roughing"" it.) but i knew at normal lunch or snak time he would want warm food. he wouldn't eat the school lunches (in his words he said the food tastes like poo) then i tried making his lunches but he asked me why i was packing his lunch like he is going camping. lol.. he's very particular.\n\ni set out to find SOMETHING that i could send warm foods kept warm to school with him. he had horrible days before the mr bento arrived. get the box from amazon. i did extensive web research on it and it's cheapest at amazon (because the other sites may be a few dollars cheaper BUT you must pay for shipping..the mr bento qualifies for free shipping).. i did pay to have his box overnighted because i couldn't bare to have him starve another day at school.\n\nthe box comes entirely in japanese which is so cool. like many of the other people, his box came with english & japanese instructions. it's very efficient and he says his food is warm all day using it for snak and lunchtime. his food is even mildly warm when i pick him up in the afternoon (after being opened and probably left open allowing heat to escape.)\n\nwhen i want everything in the box to be kept entirely warm i pour semi-boiling water into the large metal outer container and then i snap the lid shut for 5 min while his meals are microwaving. the bowls are microwavable, but don't do it with the lids on. by the time everything is done microwaving (microwaving inside the bowls also increases the heat retention i've noticed) the outer jar is sufficiently heated to hold in even more heat. and you don't really need to use all 4 bowls (but i've found that using all 4 bowls really encourages a diverse diet with veggies, snak, soup, main entree)..\n\nthe bowls DO need to go in at a certain order or some of the smaller bowls may be hard to retrieve. they are meant to stack from soup bowl on the bottom, rice/insulated bowl on top of that, then the larger of the tupperware style snap on lid bowls on top of the rice bowl. with lastly a smaller condiment,snack sized bowl goes on top of that. but sometimes i send him without the soup bowl and the rice bowl becomes the bottom stacking the other two on top. experiment!\n\nhe has said that his nacho cheese or caramel dip for his apples are still warm by snack time (maybe 4 hours after i pack the lunch). and that's the top little bowl which isn't really insulated.\n\nif you don't heat the outer container up then it will be perfect for holding two warm items and two cold ones like fruit.\n\nif you have a picky eater at school this is the way to go. or if you are more whole food oriented like me this is the way to go. your kid will be the envy of his overly processed food eating peers.\n\nsince massimo's mr. bento arrived last thursday he has taken teriyaki salmon, asparagus, stew, clam chowder, nacho cheese, chips, caramel dip, and soy beans to school. everything warm at the proper times. now all of the other parents want to know where i got it from! it's really neat looking and the kids will really appreciate it. i was a little worried about my kindergartener taking proper care of it, but i taught him how to remove food and replace it etc while keeping the heat in.\n\nnow he's a pro and he cherishes it. he realizes without it he'd be forced to eat the crappy school food or cold sandwiches i make at home. plus he's the coolest 4 year old on campus with gourmet lunches.\n\nget the mr. bento. don't let the price discourage you. i'd honestly gladly payy $100 or more for this. trust me, it pays for itself nearly instantly.";i wish i could give mr bento 10 stars!!!
149;55.0;5.0;21.0;4542;I just received my Mr. Bento lunch container and I love it!  The containers are smaller than I had first imagined, but the container overall holds a lot of food, in reasonable serving-sized portions.  Even the carrying case is well designed.\n\nThere are many other reviews that mention the lack of instructions in English--they must be reading your reviews as my Mr. Bento came with both the kanji pamphlet and a well-written English translation.  They include the tip to warm up the outer thermos container and the two bottom containers by filling them with hot water for a few minutes prior to putting your food in them.  This will add to the heat-keeping ability of the containers.\n\nThis lunch system is an excellent way to save money and reduce waste and save energy.  Well worth initial expense!;Excellent!

152;52.0;3.0;23.0;4558;"I don't know if it's mentioned elsewhere, but it would appear that the bottom half (i.e. rice and soup bowls) of the container is designed to stay hot, while the area with the top two containers is designed to stay cool (since the lid has no insulation and the lid to the rice bowl blocks the heat from the rice and soup).  It would appear that the diagram on the box says as much.\n\nI get good use out of this, but it is A LOT of dishes to clean when you are done (chopsticks+4 lids+4 bowls).  It does a good job of recreating a mini 'Asian buffet' experience, but it is basically just a glorified Japanese lunch pail.\n\nEdit: Years later we got one of these for our son and the later versions are microwave and dishwasher safe (unlike my earlier version).  As well, I got a hold of some plastic (one of those 'disposable' cutting boards) and glued some foil to it to improve the insulation between the two layers (lightly frezzing the ""meat"" dish, if possible, helps as well).";Interesting
153;12.0;5.0;69.0;4570;"When I saw the Mr. and Mrs. Bento box, I knew immediately that this was the exact thing that I needed for my daily lunches.  I pack everyday, and was using mismatched tupperware containers which would spill in my bag when not sealed properly. I knew it was time to find something better.\n\nThe package arrived as a box completely in japanese, much like how the other reviewers have stated. Fortunately through diligent searching on the web, I was able to find instructions without having to contact the company.\n\nThe bento box consists of a bag to carry it in, a thermos container, and 4 plastic dishes with lids, which stack on top of one another inside the thermos.\n\nThe thermos can hold things cold, or it can keep things hot. The beauty of the bento box, is the largest container has an extra thick lid so that you can carry two items hot, and two items cold on top.\n\nThe soup container holds the wettest items. Put your soups, runny things and chilis in here. The lid twists completely shut, with a small plugged opening on top that can release pressure from heat.\n\nThe biggest container with the thick insulated lid can hold anything that is not runny. I put a salad with a vinegar dressing on it, and the vinegar ran out a bit because of the lack of a seal.  This container is good for beans or anything thick that can't get out.  I like to put my salads in here. Also I use it to hold rice.\n\nThe next stacked container is big enough to fit in some fruit. I like to cut up strawberries/ grapes/ or stick chips or pretzels inside.\n\nAnd the smallest container is really great for putting nuts and raisins or a condiment inside.\n\nThe pocket of the bento carrying case can fit bread wrapped in foil or saran wrap. Also I use it to carry a napkin.\n\nThe mr. bento comes with a set of chopsticks which come in handy if you are a seasoned chopstick user. The chopsticks are nice, and come with grips on them for extra ""grabbing"" power. And they come in a snap shut case.\n\nI love my Mr. Bento box. I pack my lunch for work everyday. I am a vegetarian, and use a lot of my leftovers for lunch the next day, and the Bento box enables me to carry items easily to and from work.  It has changed my eating habits, enabling me to save money from not going out to eat, and also makes eating lunch more fun, and desirable (they say presentation is half the appeal!)\n\nI highly recommend this product!";The best lunchbox there is!
154;56.0;5.0;21.0;4576;As soon as the package came, I washed the containers and started experimenting.  In the evening, I cooked rice, soup, a main entree and cut up some apples.  I immediately put them in the different compartments accordingly and left the container out overnight.  Next day, during lunch, the soup, rice and entree were still hot and the apples cool.  It's such a nice overall package, well made and comes with chopsticks in a neat little case.  The compartments are tidy and the serving sizes are just right for a sensible meal.  I will get these for other members of my family shortly.  I'm actually more motivated to cook and pack lunches in the morning.;Impressed
155;60.0;4.0;20.0;4605;I thought this product was very price @ first, but it was so pleasing to the eye.  I just love the unique style.  So I brought it.  If you are going to warm your lunch in the microwave I found you should use platic wrap as a lining to avoid staining your bowls. (I use Glad Press and Seal... Sticky side facing the container.);Worth Every Cent!!!
156;37.0;5.0;31.0;4711;My bento box's lid broke so I went to my local Korean grocer to see what they had now to replace it. I found this there for $44.99 and have never looked back! At first I thought it was a little too large for a lunchbox, but after I remembered all the fruits and other foods i've squished from carrying my lunch in a plastic sack, i realized it's better for carrying them and the bag with strap is pretty to carry (I put it on my bike rack to get to work. Though the instructions don't recommend carrying it horizontally, it's been fine as long as there's nothing watery in the containers with top valves). the insulating properties are really nice- I'd accustomed myself to eating warm foods by the time lunch came around, but it's nice to have the option.\n\nI'm the kind of person who'd rather find the right thing and use it forever than buy something cheap that breaks or replace stuff when the next big thing comes along, and this is just right for me. It's a little tank that will last for a long time- cleanup is easy, it's well-built, and easy to use. Tiger makes a similar case that's about the same size- its advantage is the carrying strap and chopstick box carrier is built into the flask's outside so you don't have to grapple with the bag. It also holds more food, but IMHO the containers aren't built as well and are harder to open & close. And the Mr Bento bag is good for throwing added stuff into, like silverware and napkin, etc. It also has 4 containers instead of 3 so you can hold more stuff separately.;Compact and well-made
157;67.0;5.0;18.0;4736;I just received my lunch jar, complete with Japanese instructions. It is obvious from the illustrations that you need to do SOMEthing with various parts, but being that they were in Japanese, I had no clue. Even going to the Web site indicated in the instructions proved no help -- entirely Japanese, and I couldn't find an email link to send them a question.\n\nThanks, Umabelly, for providing the English (in your review here) for pertinent information. I would never have known not to put anything but rice in the large container, and probably would have microwaved with the lids on.\n\nNow I feel I can use the lunch jar safely.\n\nRuthann;Thanks to Umabelly for English instructions!
158;3.0;5.0;969.0;4851;"I bought one of these not too long ago. I thought it was a little expensive,* but I can see that I will get many years of service from it.\n\nThe construction of all the components are very sturdy, and the container is very well insulated. The bag has an outside pocket that you can use to store a napkin (or teabags, as I do) and comes with a detachable shoulder strap and an attached short carrying strap. Inside the bag, along with the thermal container, is a utensil box that holds a pair of chopsticks. Everything is quality construction - even the chopsticks, which have a textured surface on the business end of them making it easier for you to pick up food with them. Whoever designed this package gave it a lot of thought.\n\nThe bottom two containers are intended for holding rice and soup; the rice container has an insulated cap, allowing you can to store hot & cold items in the same container.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend one of these to anyone who needs a lunchbox.\n\nMy only complaints (which are minor, but included here for the sake of completeness): the instructions are in Japanese (as if you needed them), and no western utensils (you can pack your own fork). But outside of that, it's a perfect product.\n\n*Expensive? It paid for itself in 2 weeks - after I bought it, I stopped eating fast food for lunch.\n\n** It's been 2 years since I bought - yet to show any sort of appreciable wear and tear. I love this thing!\n\n*** It's now been about 5 years. Still using it, still in darn good shape.\n\n*** It's now been about 10 years. Still using it. No appreciable wear.\n\n*** 13 years strong and still going. Best purchase ever";Worth it? Yes.
159;11.0;5.0;80.0;4922;"My son ONLY likes hot food for lunch and at 9 that can be a little hard unless he actually buys his lunch - but he doesn't like the school lunches!  The Zojirushi Mr. Bento is great!  He usually brings a soup (placed in the soup bowl at the bottom of the jar), a main meal, vegetables and fruit.  The bottom two containers stay piping hot for HOURS (if you add boiling water to the two containers for 5 minutes - it can last for a VERY long time.  Let's put it this way - I ""tested"" it (without the hot water) and the soup was PIPING hot a good 4 hours later!  The way the containers are arranged - the last two containers can stay at a cooler temperature.  He can eat hot food - like soup - AND a salad and fruit.  He LOVES it!";Great if you love hot food for lunch!

0;1.0;3.0;6.0;0;I purchased the Palm IIIX because I thought that it had an open expansion slot for addition of memory upgrade cards.  I wasn't able to locate the expansion slot for additional memory, so, I contacted Palm.  The customer representative stated that it is only upgradeable as far as the operating system is concerned.  You aren't able to use an additional memory card for this handheld.\n\nI have been able to download some applications to the handheld, but, I would have preferred more memory.;Mislead
1;25.0;3.0;14.0;1908;When I first got my IIIx, I adored it.  I simply couldn't live without it.  All of my appointments were in there, my friends addresses, phone numbers, everything.  As soon as I knew of a meeting or doctor's visit, got a new phone number, I would pop it open and enter it.  I was in heaven.\nThen, one day, it wouldn't turn on.  I had to replace my batteries - which had been practically brand new and then all information - much of which I'd entered directly onto it and which therefore was not backed up on my home computer - was gone.  Since then, my efforts to use it have been disastrous.  After HotSyncing all of my data back on, I would turn it on to find the Stylus tutorial - 'Press here, here, here' and so on.  For the past several months, I have been unable to use it.\nStill, it is my frustration and annoyance that prevents me from giving this a higher rating, not the quality of the product, which really is quite good.  Like I said, when it worked, it was perfect, and I miss it very much.  I'm in the process, actually, of trying to fix it/get it fixed so that I can use it again.  It really is a remarkable tool, one that can make it incredibly easy to access enormous amounts of information.;When it worked, I couldn't live without it...
2;37.0;4.0;6.0;1920;I bought the IIIx last Christmas and 3Com has already upgraded it with the IIIxe and the IIIc, the major upgrades being the extra memory for the xe  and the color for the c.  However, the IIIx still stands on it's own quite  well.  With 4 mb of memory, it still has lots of room for applications and  data.  It took a few weeks to get used to using a PDA, but once I did, it  has saved me time and time again as I have not once doubled booked an  appointment since having this device.  Right now it's the lowest cost 3com  unit that has the upgradable OS capability, which I think is an important  feature.  If you have the $50, you might as well move up to the xe and get  the extra 4 mb of memory, but if you don't and need a workhorse, there  isn't much the more expensive IIIxe will do that the IIIx can do just as  well.  I'm sold on mine.;Good all-around product
3;8.0;4.0;67.0;2102;"I have wanted a Palm Pilot since they came out and being a poorcollege student, I wanted to make sure that I got the best dealpossible.  I have had my Palm IIIx for about a month and I can say that I am quite pleased with it. There are a few flaws, but I will present the pros and cons of purchasing a Palm IIIx. Please email me with any questions.\nPros: -There is an abundance of software out there and several sites.  More software is coming out daily and some of my favs are jot, Traffic, Four.zero, and flash, among others. -You will get a lot of attention, this is a great toy and people are interested in it. -an excellent way to get organized, much more fun than a pad a paper and plus, there are alarms to remind you of important dates. -The handwriting recognition is superb. I once owned a Davinci which has horrible recognition. I would also suggest Jot, which is a program with a more advanced handwriting recognition system. -Customer support is ok, I'm not blown away by it but I can understand because there are a lot of palm users out there. -The price. In my opinion, it is the best value out there.\nCons: -yes, you have heard it everywhere. The backlight is pretty weird. But it's not terrible, it does the job -I have had mine crash twice in a month, but luckily only one time did I lose data.  There is a ""soft"" reset which comes in handy -Everyone else says the hotsych is great, but I have had problems with it. I cannot get it to work on my computer, but that may be the exception.  -no color display, but hey, I can live without it because it costs hundreds of dollars more.\nOverall, great product. It's fun and helps me to be more organized.  Buy it!";Not perfect, but  a great product
4;15.0;4.0;32.0;2103;The Palm iii is a great product, and the Palm iiix is definately worth the extra money if you run Outlook on your PC - within days you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.  But it is fragile - really fragile.  I've dropped my mobile phone on countless occasions, likewise my calculator, and  even my lap top once or twice.  And they all lived to tell the tale.  Drop  your Palm once, and you can be looking at a cracked screen and - Wham!  $100 replacement fee.  What's more, you can be waiting 3-5 days for a  replacement to arrive.  So if you're anywhere near as clumsy as me - buy a  case, and be very careful when you're taking it out;Handle with Care!
5;18.0;4.0;30.0;2106;Having used a paper Daytimer for years, I was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing.  Boy, have I been converted!  The Palm IIIx (my second Palm - the first being a III) is, for  me, a great value.\nIt has enough memory for anyone but the most  compulsive note-taking, yellow page totin' workaholic among us.  (I  download an average of 300 Palm formatted web pages a day and have had no  problem with space in memory at all.  I also keep about 700 phone listings  and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times)  It has the  improved screen and processor versus the III.  And it has the benefit of  the Palm community of software developers that is what sets Palm devices  apart from Windows CE (and other) devices.\nI like the fold-over cover  both for protection and for the Star Trek communicator look :) and feel.  The backlight takes a little getting used to.  It is not useful at all for  dim daylight use, but works just fine in dark situations.\nI really want  the Palm Vx for the sexy size and industrial feel, but I have no real  reason to move away from a device that does everything I need and more (and  costs a lot less).;What wouldl I do without it?
6;39.0;4.0;5.0;2110;Palm IIIx is cool but for the price I paid, I expected a much better finish. Not very happy with the battery life too. Otherwise it's really a great product!;Get yourself Organized !
7;20.0;3.0;25.0;2115;"First, I have to agree with the electronics fan from Chicago.  Although my Palm got the date right, some of the pixels on the screen would stay lit no matter what program was running.  At first the ""Customer Care  Center"" with Palm accused me of dropping it or something;  ""physical damage"".  They told me it would cost me $100 (US) to  have it replaced (I assumed a new unit). This really irrtated me.  When I  bought it (Dec. '99)it worked fine, when I replaced the batteries once, I  started to have problems like this.  Eventually, after some serious,  pissiness on the phone with representitive, they offered me a used unit.  I  sympathize with the electronics fan.  After all, it doesn't even feel like  mine, call me crazy, but I bought MINE not someone else's.  So far the used  Palm has worked fine, but I would really like them to fix their mistakes  for us insted of shipping off the other misfit products to their customers.";The PalmIIIx is great, but I have a few problems.
8;14.0;5.0;34.0;2128;"It's a great machine, and I'm glad I purchaced the IIIx. I've seen the V and the VII, and the IIIx is the best. I do wish I had waited a little longer for the color version, but that doesn't really matter for me, because I use the MIDI software more than anything else. The memo pad is  cool too. I take notes in class and print them out with my desktop comp. I  also have a color cover, and that makes it look brighter. The backlit  screen is great!\n I also researched the Handspring Visor, but the  color display was hard on the batteries, and the memory says it's  ""upgradable,"" but I haven't seen any proof yet.\nSo buy the IIIx  if you don't care about color, and if you need the extra 2 megs.";I like it enough to write a review...Need I say more?
9;35.0;5.0;8.0;2128;As a frequent traveler I've often found myself in a situation where a notebook/laptop was a burden to carry and use (where do I plug in to recharge?). With Palm IIIx i've met a device which can hold the regular  data I need :bussiness and personal contacts, appointments, e-mails.  The  new screen offers better contrast and the AAA batteries seem to run  forever.;180 degrees shift towards productivity
10;12.0;1.0;44.0;2130;I am a first time owner of the Palm IIIx and I am currently searching for an alternative.  I received my Palm IIIx as a gift about 7 months ago, and I have lost all of the data in my organizer 8 times.  I am an active  professional in the television industry and I travel to remote parts of the  world for weeks at a time.  I have been away from my computer (to HotSync  and restore the data) all but one time and have been left without vital  professional and personal contacts as well as lost all new contacts and  production memos and notes.  I have determined the cause of the failure.  If you own a Palm IIIx and have it with you, follow along with me.  Locate  the battery compartment on the back of the unit.  Open it up and look at  the way the compartment is designed to have the batteries installed.  The  top AAA battery slot is designed such that the positive end of the battery  (the one with the 'bump') must maintain contact with a wire coil.  What  happens is this.  Let's say you have your Palm IIIx in your purse,  briefcase, backpack, fannypack or WHEREVER.  If you drop your bag, set it  down a little too hard, or even RUN with it, chances are that the contact  coil will slip off of the positive terminal on the battery and you'll lose  all of the memory in your organizer.  First and foremost, I CANNOT BELIEVE  that 3Com allowed this product to be released with such an incredibly inept  design flaw.  Second, I can't believe that they didn't install a back-up  battery to which the organizer defaults in cases of lost power for ANY  reason (let alone because the inherent design of the product leaves it  prone to losing power and therefore data).  Finally, 3Com Customer Service  has done NOTHING to respond to my repeated attempts to bring this to their  attention and ameliorate the situation.  The Palm IIIx is SUPPOSED to be a  powerful tool for powerful people.  I'd be surprised if the execs at 3Com  would utilize their own product.;Serious design flaw hinders reliability
11;17.0;5.0;31.0;2137;"It's been about a month since I got my Palm IIIx. Since then, I'm more organized than I've ever been. I decided to get myself a palm pilot for two reasons. I hated having to manually update my monthly planner whenever a  new year rolled in (things like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.). Another  reason was because I wanted all my contact information to be in one single  place.  I had these info spread out all around me like a wild fire (some at  home, at work, in the bathroom, ah... just kidding on the bathroom, but you  get the point, right?). With this Palm I can have upto 12,000 people in my  address book (I have 100 so far and I've been telling people that the  10,000th person to go into my palm address book gets free dinner from me,  ha.\nNow, then the reason I bought Palm IIIx over visor and other Palm  products was due to various reasons. I did a intense research to find out  which product would best fill my needs. Visor had the cool design going and  maybe cool features like modules that can be added to turn your visor into  mp3 players, etc. But from what I found out, these feature were not being  fully utilized just yet (maybe in one more year someone said). The reason I  went w/ IIIx over other versions (e.g., V, VII) was because it had 4 megs  of memory plus the price was right.\nI've downloaded a lot of programs and  installed them into my palm w/ ease.\nI've only had a problem once and  that was when my palm was HotSync(ing) w/ my computer and something  happened and it kind of froze. However, I was able to ""soft  reset"" easily by pressing that little button in the back.\nOverall,  this is an excellent all around product even for a first time user, like  me.\n-bingolian";First time user: a solid all around product
12;5.0;4.0;73.0;2140;"As an obsessive-compulsive middle-management suck-up, I knew that I would ultimately own a Palm of some sort.  Deciding which PDA to purchase proved extremely difficult.\nFirst, WinCE devices were ruled out.  They're just  too darned expensive to justify being able to listen to media files and  have your batteries run out every other day because of the power drain from  the color display.  Plus, I'm sick and tired of Windows.  I wanted  something new.\nThat leads to the Palm platform.  Next question: Palm or  Handspring?  I asked a friend who bought a Handspring about a month ago.  ""Don't do it,"" he said.  ""I spend more time fixing this  thing than I do using it for any relevant purpose.""\nWell, that left  the 3Com Palm series.  Now, do I get the Palm IIIx, the Palm V, or the Palm  VII?\nThe Palm VII is just to darned expensive.  It's up there with the  WinCE devices, and I just don't have the need (or the desire) to be able to  1-Click stuff from Amazon.com while I'm in the middle of the Sahara.  If  I'm going to shell out that kind of money, I may as well get a Cassiopeia,  or whatever it is called.\nI liked the looks of the Palm IIIx, but I had  to wonder why the Palm V was consistently outselling the IIIx.\nAfter a  little research, I can't believe that anybody would shell out another $100  for a Palm V.  Your hard-earned B. Franklin gets you a smaller, fancier  case and no capacity for memory expansion.  I settled for a Palm IIIx, a  leather case, some styli, and Tiger Woods Golf, and ending up spending  $250.\nI no longer need to carry around the 10-pound paper organizer that  used to store my life history and marked me as obsessive-compulsive (or  just plain disorganized).  I can take notes and schedule meetings on the  bus.  And I can play a round of golf without leaving the comfort of my own  bathroom.  George Jetson and Sigmund Freud would be proud.";The best value for your money
13;22.0;5.0;18.0;2142;This is my third Palm and the best yet. I chose the the IIIx because of the 4meg and the fact that it uses AAA batteries. I travel often and cannot worry about keeping the Palm in a cradle to re-charge. The V is a  disappointment unless you are only into style and keeping a few  appointments and addresses. The 2meg is a huge downside and is only good  for the casual user. If you use Avantgo daily, then the V is going to hold  you back from fully utilizing this great site. The Vx, which is still pricy,  is an 8meg unit and far beyond the needs of the average user. If price is no  object, then this a great unit, except for the re-charging needs of being  in a cradle.  At it's current pricing, there is no question that the IIIx  is the best valued PDA in the marketplace .;Excellent Handheld Computer
14;28.0;1.0;14.0;2146;"Does Palm have a problem it's not admitting? My two-day old Palm IIIx lost all its data this morning--garbage on the screen, no response to power button. A soft reset ""restored"" the unit--not the data, of  course, just the factory defaults.\nFunny thing is, the Palm IIIx  replaced a Palm III which had lost all its data the day before I bought the  new one. I figured the old Palm III had probably had it, but at least it  had served faithfully for two years. The new Palm IIIx didn't make it  through two days.\nPalm tech support says the ""solution"" to  lost data is a reset. Sure it is--that restores the unit to its factory  condition. And then you synchronize it again to restore from your desktop.  And again and again and again? Tonight will be the third attempt to get the  data I depend on every day from my desktop to a Palm III model. All I want  is a Palm IIIx that can hang on to my data for more than a day!";Lost all my data--twice
15;19.0;5.0;27.0;2146;The Palm IIIx is a less expensive alternative to the PalmV. Comparing featues, I didn't find much to warrant shelling out the extra $100. Sure, the V is thinner and lighter (by a few ounces) but $100 more for less RAM  and a rechargable battery? Flash upgrade the OS ASAP, backup your data to a  PC and you're off and running *without* a laptop. I connect to my e-mail  server from almost anywhere through my Motorola phone. The IIIx is by far  the best organizational tool I've ever used!;Palm IIIx packs a punch for less
16;24.0;4.0;15.0;2149;While Handspring launched the Visor to compete directly with the Palm IIIx, it falls short of this great PDA.\nThe Haqndspring may *advertise* expandability, but it has yet to deliver.  Also, you can never upgrade the  OS it carries, the Palm IIIx wins again.  Finally, the Visor has a  protective top that is *not connected* to the body...easily lost.  On top  of everything else, Handspring's Tech Support is miserable and slow.  It  takes weeks to get a response!\nThe Palm IIIx, with it's recently lowered  price will easily beat out Handspring.  This is the best PDA on the market.;Beats Handspring
17;31.0;3.0;11.0;2149;I just bought a Palm IIIx and although the functionality of the machine is great, I've had glitches with my unit.  I had problems performing the hot-sync - maybe a problem with the unit or cradle and the batteries would  go dead after 2-3 days (this happened three times).  I also lost all my  data (twice) without any low battery warning.  I'm getting a replacement  and I hope that this was a anomaly.;Defective Unit?
18;10.0;3.0;55.0;2158;3Com did a great job creating the Palm line and OS. But since the birth of the Visor, they are no longer best on the block.\nHandspring Visors are the same machine but better, cheaper, and easily expandable. They even have a plug and play slot. You can get twice the memory of a Palm IIIx for $20  less. You can get the same 4MB as the Palm IIIx for $120 less. Same OS,  same user interface, same everything. Except the Visors also have a better  screen and Palms are not explandable. Need I go on?\nDo yourself a  favor. Go to handspring;Great start but now totally obsolete
19;3.0;4.0;131.0;2159;"If you don't want to spend all that money on the slimmer, sleeker Palm V, and you know you don't want a WinCE device, then the IIIx is the way to go.\nThe IIIx has the same screen technology and processor as the IIIe,  but twice as much memory. Some users have reported ""streaking""  problems on the screen. I have not experienced that. In most cases, my  screen is very clear and readable.\nHowever, Palm recently introduced the  ""reverse backlighting"" feature that inverts the color when you  turn it on. It's great when you're sitting in very dark conditions, but in  dimly lit rooms or during twilight outside, it can be quite difficult to  read the screen because of the reverse backlighting. I learned, though,  that there is a simple Graffiti shortcut to make the backlight  ""normal"". Even with the normal backlighting, I had trouble  reading the screen in twilight conditions.\nAnother feature of the IIIx  that the IIIe lacks is an upgradeable operating system. This was the  deciding factor for me when I chose the IIIx over the IIIe. The current  PalmOS is 3.3, but the IIIe was shipping with 3.1 when I bought the unit  for a friend for Christmas. The IIIx also had 3.1, but I immediately  upgraded it to 3.3. There is no way to do that on the IIIe.\nYou may ask,  Why would I need OS 3.3 instead of 3.1? Here's one reason: HotSyncing via  infrared. OS 3.1 can't do it. If you're a laptop user and don't feel like  carrying your HotSync cradle everywhere, or springing the extra money for a  USB cable, then IR is a great feature. It's slower than the cradle, but way  more convenient.\nThe IIIx also has an internal expansion slot that the  IIIe lacks. Supposedly, you can open up your IIIx and plug devices like  pager cards, etc., into it, but I don't think many of these devices exist  right now. It wasn't a deciding factor for me.\nMany people (including  myself) have wondered: Why get a Palm IIIx instead of a Handspring Visor  Deluxe? Here's is my reason, that I don't see many people mentioning: like  the IIIe, the OS in the current Handsprings CANNOT be upgraded. That means  if it ships with OS3.1, you are stuck with it.\nIf upgrading your OS is  important to you, you should not get a current model of the Visor. (Perhaps  in the future, their models will be upgradeable.)\nThe other reason I  chose the IIIx over the Handspring was that Handspring was experiencing 6  week delays. I know that another reviewer has said he got his in 2.5 weeks,  but if Handspring's own website is saying ""It's going to be 6  weeks,"" then you pretty much have to take it at face value. I just  checked their site as I write this, and it says their wait is down to four  weeks. If you can wait that long and don't need an upgradeable version,  then I would take a hard look at the Visor. It has a lot of attractive  features. Remember that Visors ship with a USB cradle. If you don't have  USB support on your computer, you'll have to purchase a serial cradle for  (I think) $10.\nAs far as cost goes on the IIIx, shop around a little if  you're cost-conscious.\nTo sum up, get the IIIx if:\n(a) You can't  afford/don't need the slimness of the V or Vx (b) Need the extra memory  compared to the V or IIIe (c) Need the upgradeable OS or IR HotSync (d)  Can't wait the possible 4 weeks for the Visor.\nHope this info is useful.";An excellent, reasonably priced organizer
20;34.0;5.0;9.0;2159;The palm will certainly revolutionize the way you arrange your life. At the touch of a button, you can connect it to your PC and transfer all of its information (which also means you can input information to your palm  from your PC). There's a myriad of freeware available on the net that will  enhance the performance of the Palm IIIx. The screen is great for viewing.  4MB is more than you'll ever need (I have many programs loaded, and  thousands of phone numbers and appointments, and I only use 1.3 MB).\nThe  great advantage of the Palm IIIx is that it uses batteries (versus the Palm  V and Vx, which are rechargeable), which means you don't have to carry your  cradle when you travel, and you can get batteries for it anywhere! Small,  lightweight, highly efficient. I highly recommend it.;Wonderful, great value!
21;38.0;5.0;6.0;2177;I am a student at a major university and it keeps everything from homework assignment, deadline and other project organized and convenient.  It sure beats using a dayplanner.

22;11.0;3.0;55.0;2179;"I have to say that I've grown very dependent on my IIIx.  I'd give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem.  Mine didn't do this right away.  It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it.  Sometimes its there sometimes it isn't.  When its there, the streaking  (looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing) can make the  screen totally unreadable.  Five minutes later, all can be fine.  PDA need  to be dependable.  Mine isn't always.  Before I started reading other  reviews, I thought mine was just broken.  I was considering buying another  but not if by luck, I get another ""streaker"".  Even though I like  the IIIx, its reasonably priced (though still expensive), has great  software options, I'd be cautious about buying another one.  Probably  wouldn't go with the IIIx if I had known about the streaking problem in  advance.";Good but BEWARE the streaks
23;2.0;4.0;186.0;2182;"The big questions these days is what organizer to get. I'll assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the Palm OS beats CE any day. So the choice is a Palm Vx, a Palm V, a IIIx or a Visor. I can't recommend the Visor right now due to the horrible problems people are  having with Handspring...maybe in another year, but not now.\nThe new Vx  is a good choice, lots of memory and the other advantages of the Palm V  like a better screen, and rechargeable battery. But the darn thing is still  overpriced. If money is no problem though, I'd probably go with the Vx.\nThe V is good too, but only 2 meg of memory...yuck! Now, 2 meg of memory  is going to be enough for a lot of people. If all you want to do is the  basic appointment/phone book/to-do stuff, 2 meg is more than you'll ever  need. But that's it...you're stuck with 2 meg and can't upgrade (easily).  If you are interested in using your Palm to do internet stuff, grab  webpages with AvantGo, play games, read books, etc. you're going to find  yourself a bit squeezed by 2 meg. You can still do quite a bit, but it's a  bit more work to manage your space.\nNow, for less money you can get the  IIIx. You'll have twice as much memory, and the ability to upgrade. I  personally put on the TRG xtra xtra pro board which gave me 4 meg more of  RAM and 2 meg more Flash...it's like having an 11 meg Palm! Really great.  Of course, I bought this before the Palm Vx came out, today it's not quite  as good a deal to do.\nOne other reason I like the Palm IIIx is that I  have a lot of add-ons that only work with it...the Palm Navigator  (compass), the Weatherguide, Landware's GoVox voice recorder, etc. I don't  believe these will fit a Palm V. Of course, it goes both ways....Palm's new  33.6 modem and the new wireless Omnisky modem only fit the Palm V.\nI do  believe the Palm V has a better screen, it doesn't seem to have the streaks  that a lot of the Palm IIIx's have. And there's no doubt it has a certain  ""coolness"" factor. Most of my friends at work went with the Palm  V. But they are fairly impressed with the space and the accessories I have  for my Palm IIIx.";A great choice but not perfect
24;30.0;5.0;12.0;2183;This was the first PDA I had ever purchased and I was unsure if the product would meet my needs.  After reading all the reviews I decided to purchase the Palm IIIx...and I have to say that the product more than lives up to the reviews.  It is easy to use and has more than enough features for  the standard user.  I wonder why it took me so long to purchase one after  using my Palm IIIx.  I would recommend this product to anyone.;For a first purchase...this is the one

If you are a student, just go for it. Its very easy to use, and has a lots of free applications and games in the internet. Even  better this thing has a flash rom, which means the OS is upgradable(The  upgrades are also FREE in the net), not only that you can also share  information with other Palm III, V or VII Organizers through the IR  transmitter.

If you want a functional PDA, and not a metal  wrapped toy, you want the IIIx, or wait til feb for the III color.\nAs for  the syncing issues, the new 3.3 Palm OS allowes for IR hotsync and improved  email transfer.

27;29.0;5.0;14.0;2191;I have had a Palm for the past two years and found I cannot live without it. It is not only the built in applications which make my life easier, but the thousands of 3rd party applications available for free or next to  nothing on the internet, which expand the use of my palm to something I use  20 times a day. There is software which will allow you to track your  banking and merge the data with Quicken or other banking software, store  maps, look up a zip code or area code, download entire books, play games,  create shopping lists, and with a modem, even let you surf the internet, or  send and receive e-mail and faxes. I even have my entire CD collection of  over 600 cd's stored by artist, title and song name which I converted from  a spreadsheet and stored on my Palm. When I go to the record store to find  new songs, I can instantly see if I have a particular song on another disk.  The endless expandibility via 3rd party applications is probably the Palm  IIIx best feature.;A Must Have for anyone
28;23.0;1.0;18.0;2199;Palm 3's are not what they are all cracked up to be. Speaking of cracked up, thats what you feel like when you try to synchronize it with your PC or Mac.  For a little bit more money, the Palm V or Palm VX are a better  choice.;3 is not for me
29;6.0;5.0;72.0;2218;I have been trying to find faults with my IIIX since I bought it three months ago, and still cannot. Every time I think I have found something I don't like I consult the manual and my solution is in black and white. Next  thay need to have voice activation so it will type while you talk and I  don't have to write while driving. As good as this product is it won't be  long.;Best product I've bought since my 1st PC
30;4.0;5.0;93.0;2219;"I bought by Palm IIIx on a whim.  I figured, ""Well, everyone else seems to think they're great.""  They were right.  The Palm IIIx is fantastic.  For me, the best features are its address book and the ""To  Do List.""  Gone are the little scraps of paper I used to use to keep  all my lists of stuff to do.  I've been completely neglecting my paper  address book ever since I got the IIIx.  Between its small size, its ease  of use, and its versatility, this Palm is a winner all around.  BTW, I  highly recommend the O'Reilly PalmPilot guide to go with it.  Like all  O'Reilly books, this one cuts right to the chase.  It makes the IIIx even  easier to use.";The little engine that could
31;16.0;5.0;32.0;2222;"I absolutely love my Palm IIIx.  Originally, my wife ordered a Handspring Visor for my birthday.  Six weeks later, with no indication of when (if ever) the Visor would be shipping, she cancelled it and ordered the Palm  IIIx for me instead.  I've been playing endless with it since.\nI find,  for example, it's easier to write on the PDA than on paper in a moving car;  hence, car rides can be much more productive.\nThen I found out about  downloading games from the Internet.  I've been wasting endless amounts of  time playing a beloved game from my college days (""Rogue"").";Love it so much I'm neglecting my laptop!
32;9.0;4.0;61.0;2234;I love it. Great software available. The only drawback I have found is the batteries. 2 AAA batteries are not enough. They learned and the V has lithium batteries. Oh well.;Great toy but needs better batteries
33;21.0;2.0;23.0;2237;Although I love it and found it to be more useful than I had expected when it would not turn on or activiate after two months of use I felt lost, ripped off and up a creek with out a paddle.  Would 3com upgrade to the  latest model - NO WAY !  Did it take 10 minutes to speak to someone in  customer service - count on it.  It may be too early for this technology to  last and $300 plus for a 2 month day planner will hurt you just like it did  me !  You have been warned !;very useful but mine malfunctioned within 2 months
34;33.0;5.0;11.0;2237;The PalmIIIx is something that no one can live without. I recieved my palmIIIx on Nov 3rd of 1999 I love it. What I really like is that you can but a small portable keyboard that you can hook up to your palmIIIx and  type in the information that you want to put in instead of writing it. This  product is fun and easy to use. I love the e-mail. Now I don't have to wait  for my desktop to boot up and then sign of to AOL. I get the internet all  here with the push of a green button wait two seconds then push on the  e-mail and check it. It's so easy to use I love it.;The BEST!
35;7.0;5.0;72.0;2244;Just wanted to say to anyone who, like me, was not sure whether to buy the new, funkier Palm V or the Palm IIIx.. Just read all of the reviews listed  here and your mind will be made up. Palm IIIx is upgradeable, more powerful  and less money...ummm...tough choice.;Do you buy the Palm IIIx or Palm V?
36;26.0;5.0;15.0;2257;"My Palm IIIx is truely one of the most enjoyable devices that I have ever owned. Boredom has become a thing of the past.  I have two whole novels stored in my Palm's memory. There is ample room for five more.  I actually  look forward to waiting in long lines. The back lighted screen makes  reading in the dark a very enjoyable activity.  The term ""User  Friendly"" is an under statement when describing the Palm's operating  system.  I wish that I had know about this little computer years earlier.  3Com or Palm has definitely won another loyal fan.";Superb!
37;40.0;5.0;5.0;2271;"WOW! Such power in a very small package. The IIIx came into my paper strewed life just when I lost my last paper Day Timer---Yeech!  With a Palm it gets to be easy to write down your important notes, appointments and  numbers. Hot Sync with your desktop and you have instant backup. At first,  I thought it would be very difficult starting from ground zero to use and  transfer information from other desktop programs. But with the help of an  ""Idiot"" book on the Palm it was very easy. It was a big help. I  hope I find my Day Timer before tax time or the IRS will have a field day  with me and my mileage expenses!  Some programs like Card Scan were tricky  to transfer data but I managed. This is not against the Palm, but rather,  programs that give little explaination to help make a smooth transfer of  data to the Palm. Another WOW! Someone just found my Day Timer in  Baltimore!";Speedy Uptime till full useability
38;27.0;5.0;15.0;2341;I first started out with a Palm V - I loved it, except for two annoyances - first, it would only handle 2 meg of RAM, and second, it would not allow any of the cool accessories you can get for the Palm.\nSo, with much  hesitation I took the Palm V back and bought a Palm IIIx - I am very happy  I did! Now I have 8 meg of RAM on it, and I can hook all those exciting  gizmos like GPS receivers to it.\nIf you are someone who just wants a  Palm device, go for the Palm V - but if you are a power user who wants  everything, do the IIIx - you will not regret it.;A power users dream
39;36.0;5.0;8.0;2421;It is amazing that something so small and so light weight can do so much.  I love my laptop, but the Palm 3X has replaced much of the on-the-road work I do and saves me from lugging my laptop through airports.  It syncrhonizes  with my desktop and laptop, stores notes, gives quick access to my roladex  and with the modem attachment allows me to get my email.  I can even put  games on the Palm 3X for when I get bored in meetings. I found learning to  write graffiti was intuitive and easy but my friends found the keyboard  attachment helpful.  I have only used the palm for 2 months and am still  learning all it can do.  The O'Reilly book David Pogue wrote gives clues to  all sorts of extra stuff that doesn't come in the manual.;The Palm 3x has changed how I work and travel

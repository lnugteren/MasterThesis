0;3.0;5.0;8.0;0;"I just received my pack this week. I've loaded and unloaded the pack a few times trying to tweak my load for a 3 day 63 mile Florida Trail hike from Lake Okeechobee to Hobe Sound (Ocean to Lake Trail). The materials all appear very durable. I thought the stitching in some areas would be reinforced a little better like another pack I own, but it still seems solid and I don't see any potential issues. The zippers are strong, the sleeping bag compartment at the bottom is roomy, and the waist belt and shoulder straps are comfy. The main compartment, side pockets, and pockets in the top rain flap are very functional. The two aluminum stiffeners are sturdy and well placed. The rain cover is completely integrated, rip-stop material, lined for waterproofing, and seems perfectly suitable for a torrential downpour.\n\nI have one complaint. My waist is 32 inches, but I have the waist belt cinched tightly. This is kind of concerning. You can lose weight during a long trip and may not have a lot of room for adjustments. If you have less than a 30 inch waist this probably won't work for you. Fortunately, I have a 30""-31"" waist when I am working out regularly and doing a lot of cardio, so it should be fine for me. Unfortunately, my recent workouts are limited to carrying a baby throughout the day and heavy reps curling 12oz IPAs:)\n\nI'll update my review if I run into any issues after three days of hard use.\n\nUPDATE 02/07/2018: The pack held up like a champ. It was extremely comfortable. The waistband and shoulder straps felt great. My only wish is it were a pound lighter, but its just fine for me. I cant justify paying double the price when I don't have the chance to hike long distances regularly. Im very glad I bought this pack!";Excellent Pack for the Price
1;13.0;5.0;11.0;98;"I'm a big guy, 6'1"" 260 pounds with a 21.5"" torso length, and a 44"" waist. This pack fits although the chest strap will be too tight come winter when I have to layer up. This pack is well made and comfortable to wear and it's large size is perfect for multiple day outings with my dog. If you utilize the attachment straps on the top and bottom you could easily use this pack for a camping trip that lasted a week or longer, depending on the gear you take. I can pack a Naturehike 3P 3 person tent with footprint, 10x10 Chill Gorilla Tarp, 3 inflatable pillows, Static V Luxe sleeping pad, food for myself and my dog, Sawyer mini filter, 3 litres of water, cook kit, fire making kit, small first-aid kit, folding saw, Mora knife, 3 headlamps, small LED lantern, battery bank, cordage, collapsible dog bowls, sleeping bag, and two complete changes of clothes with room to spare internally so the rain cover fits. I use the bottom loops to secure my dog's sleeping pad although the rain cover wouldn't cover it completely, it's easy enough to slide it inside of a garbage bag to keep it dry. If I didn't have to dog supplies, I could pack in two weeks worth of food and clothes with no trouble. The side pockets allow you to slide hiking poles, fishing rod, ax, hatchet, folding saw, tri-pod or other similar items behind them to hold it securely to the outside of the pack (although not all of it at the same time). All-in-all, it's a great pack for the price.\n\nMore importantly, Teton's customer service also deserves 5 stars and reading customer reviews about their customer service was the main reason I chose to purchase a Teton pack. Here's my experience with them.\n\nThis was my first adjustable pack and my GF misunderstood what I was asking her to do when measuring my torso and we got it wrong the first time. I ordered the Scout 3400 which turned out to be too small so I had to return it. No problem there. That's when I ordered the Explorer and the first one I received was what I would call a factory second. It was obvious that bag was overlooked by QC. It had threads hanging off of it all over the place, one strap was sewn on backwards, the zipper in the lid wouldn't zip completely closed and would work it's way open about 3 inches just from walking around with the pack on and one of the shoulder straps was frayed badly. I contacted Teton again about this pack, provided some photos and they sent a replacement the very next day, no questions asked. On top of all that, I mentioned in the email to Teton that the chest strap is pretty tight and they offered to make me a custom extension for the strap.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is a company that knows how to take care of their customers and stand behind their products 100%. They've earned my loyalty and respect and I would not hesitate for a moment to recommend them to anyone I know personally. This is one company that you can truly buy from with confidence that they will be there for you when you need them to be. Awesome!";Great pack and even better company!
2;19.0;5.0;8.0;105;Paid $75 for the 4000 65 liter green. Went through the rain, trees, thorn bushes and I am yet to damage the pack. I hike every single day, so it's loaded out at 48 lbs 24/7. I pick it up by one strap at least 4 times a day. I haul it out of the SUV and I constantly open and use the contents. Zippers, pockets, pouches and webbing are still working at 100%. I will be using this at sub zero temps soon. I will let you know how it works out.;I can't find any better deal.
3;14.0;5.0;12.0;126;"I love the back ""TETON Sports Explorer 4000 Internal Frame Backpack Metallic Silver""  I purchased on this item on September 5, 2017.  My only complaint would be that one of the side pouch zipper extensions pulls came off.  I have not been able to get is back togather adequately.  Once when I thought I did I could not get in on the zipper as it was to short to loop upon itself.  So after that I tried to reassemble it while it was on the zipper and that did not work either.  I wrote teton to let them know of this weakness and within a half hour they replied for a picture for reference and my address.  I replied right back with this and within minutes they notified me it was awaiting shipment and a tracking number would be assigned.  This kind of response really encourages me to deal with Teton again. Thank you Teton :)";Great product and Teton customer service when issues arise.

When the shoulder straps slide side to side where they meet the pack, they make the most annoying sound. This sound is so audible that it makes it hard to hear people in front of you talking.";Very LOUD noise - see video
5;32.0;5.0;5.0;146;"First, let me say how impressed I am with the adjustable back height on this backpack. It's easy to adjust, and providing you know how to properly adjust a backpack, it's extremely comfortable. It fits both me and my husband well - for reference, he's 5'10"" and 200 pounds with a long torso, I'm 5'7"" and 113 pounds and short torso'd - so, we're not the tallest folks in the world, but this can easily adjust for a much taller person without issue.\n\nThis backpack is extremely well made. I was able to pack the sleeping pad, backpack, clothes for 7 days, rain gear, toiletry kit, a dry bag, travel towel, Kindle, chargers, first aid supplies and still have room left over. It went through checked luggage since the plane was way too small to accommodate much in the way of carry ons, and it stood up to being manhandled with ease. It still looks brand new, and my husband is not always gentle with his stuff.\n\nWe didn't use any of the outer loops since it was going to be a checked luggage item, but I'm excited to see how much more room we'll have when we take it camping and can actually put the sleeping bag on the outside. It's going to be perfect for traveling abroad, too.\n\nI can't say how well it holds any cooking gear since we didn't need to pack any for this trip, but there's no doubt in my mind that it'll be able to accommodate it with ease, providing you're packing compact, lightweight gear.";We cannot be any more pleased with this backpack if we tried!
6;8.0;1.0;19.0;181;ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTED!!!\n\nI ordered this backpack for my son. We are leaving tomorrow for a 2 week hiking trip in Colorado and we started packing our backpacks for the trip. My son tried his on to see if the weight was good for him after we packed it and thats when we noticed that the hip belt had two female parts of the clip instead of a female and male to clip into each other. Therefore the backpack is not usable for our trip. I contacted Teton and asked them to correct the problem by overnighting us the male part of the clip. They responded that they wanted pictures of the items and that they will not expedite the shipping on warranty parts. Well this is not like we used the pack and something broke they literally did not assemble the pack correctly.\n\nI am beyond disappointed and pissed. I am a small business owner along with a single mom of three this is our first vacation in 7 years of me being in business. I have spent so much on gear for our trip and then to have this happen and they will not make an exception and correct their mistake before we leave is extremely disappointing.\n\n***I also ordered the Scout 3400 and the trekking pole elastic loops on my backpack were not sewn correctly therefore its just a piece of elastic hanging from my pack.***\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED in TETON and how they handle their mistakes!;BEYOND DISAPPOINTED AND PISSED!
7;35.0;5.0;6.0;273;Serious Review: Just received, packed, and haven't taken on a hike yet.  But it seems really well designed and sturdy.  I loaded it up to the brim and hit about 45 pounds total, about 20% of my body weight.  It was tight but it all fit!  Has a lot of options to adjust for your height and preferred point of balance.  And I've never bought my own backpack like this before, so maybe this is standard on all of them, but the zippered pocket at the bottom for your sleeping bag is a great idea.  Not 100% sure the included, attached rain cover will fit over wide objects strapped on, like tents or sleeping mats.\n\nSlighty Less Serious But Not Really Review: Feel free to bail out here.  I bought this backpack as a bug-out bag.  I'm a middle-to-low class suburbanite concerned about emergency preparedness for the first time in my life, thanks to the current political climate.  I just bought a full set of camping equipment for the first time in 25+ years.  My main reasons for picking this bag were its affordability, carrying capacity, sturdy design and, frankly, that the green and black will blend into the woods better if society turns into an 80's sci-fi flick these next few months.  Best scenario, I'll discover a love for recreational camping in middle age.  Worst case, I miiight survive, or leave a good cache of supplies for someone else to.\n\nI'm telling you all this because I want to share my gear list, so you understand what this pack will hold, and maybe look into getting similar stuff for yourself.  Over-prepare, folks, so you're not scrambling around like the poor, unsuspecting people during Katrina.\n\nGear That Will Fit in This Here Bag, and Cost About $1000 Total Including This Here Bag:\n\n- Ultralight sleeping bag in stuff sack\n- Two person tent, strapped to top\n- Swiss camo heavy duty rain poncho\n- Aluminum mess kit & titanium spork\n- LifeStraw\n- Two collapsible heavy duty plastic canteens, folded up\n- 3-day emergency 3600 calorie food bar pack\n- 30 day supply of freeze-dried food in resealable mylar packages\n- Seed vault in resealable bag, 15,000 heirloom vegetable seeds\n- Emergency ID, credit card, passport, and money cache\n- Small first aid kit, bandages, tourniquet, CPR mask, gloves, protective eyewear\n- 100 feet of 550 paracord\n- Magnesium firestarter\n- 1 dozen game snares\n- 6 automatic yoyo fishing reel snares\n- Roll of fishing line, hook/sinker/swivel kit\n- Disassembled slingshot and a bag of 100 metal ammo balls\n- Map of my state\n- Large bottle of Permethrin (insect repellant)\n- Small bottle of seam sealer\n- Large bottle of waterproofing spray\n- Folding camp grill\n- Anker folding solar charging panels\n- Hand-crank radio/flashlight/charger with solar cells\n- Collapsible solar shower bag\n- Tool sharpening puck\n- Ground tarp\n- Trowel\n- Microfiber quick dry towel and hand towel\n- Vanity/medical kit including travel versions of Camp Suds, potassium iodide tablets (for radiation sickness prevention), shampoo, deodorant, shaving cream, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, some basic cold/flu meds, ibuprofen, tweezers, nail clippers, unbreakable camp mirror, two bars of soap, 50 q-tips, a single pack of tissues, a roll of toilet paper with the tube removed, squashed flat\n\nEverything I could fit was put into individual ziploc bags with the air squashed out, for water protection.  I'll also be carrying a few tools on my belt, a full sized axe in my hand, a compass in my pocket, and an extra canteen on a carry strap with water purification tablets in its pouch.  I'm a big guy in good shape, and the pack feels heavy, but I think I could manage it, and there are obviously nonessentials I could remove to lessen the weight.\n\nTo be clear: the goal is to survive and be able to shelter, eat, and drink if I can't achieve these through normal means.  This isn't for long distance hikes unless absolutely necessary - just get to a safe place, and hunker down.  I've got basic supplies to see me through the first 30 days while I adapt to a lifestyle of scarcity, and tools to get food and water after.  I'm not planning to pack extra clothes (wearing full-body RealTree camo, with layers I can remove and tie to the pack), because if I need this bag for its intended purpose, clothes will be the least of my worries.  There are various other standard camping/hiking luxuries I ignored for the same reason.\n\nAnd, like I said, hopefully in a few months, or four years, I'll be able to have a good laugh about how over the top this all was, and I'll be an avid recreational camper, still using this trusty old pack.  I'll update my review as I use the pack on weekend camping trips.  So yeah, good backpack so far!  And good luck out there, everybody.;Great backpack for regular camping, or as a post-apocalyptic bug-out bag.
8;42.0;5.0;5.0;290;I have been living out of this pack for two months now. Its materials are good quality and it has tons of storage. Would recommend to a friend.;Its materials are good quality and it has tons of storage
9;24.0;1.0;11.0;303;After receiving my order I found out that there is a glue stain on the shoulder pads, I still didn't try cleaning it because I'm afraid it could make the fabric worse. Other than that everything was as mentioned.;Good but dirty
10;33.0;5.0;8.0;392;A perfect sized and fully adjustable Backpack- incredible for the price, I've used it for several pack trips now and the pack has held up very well, held all that I needed (in the pictures I took a wool blend blanket in a stuff sack) there are plenty of side pockets, separate sleeping bag compartment and organizer areas on the top, as well as places to strap extras onto the pack exterior. padded and adjustable the pack is comfortable and light weight.\n\n I understand TETON has upgraded this pack since I bought it with a mountain adventurer pack, that has more compartments for options too;Awesome backpack!!
11;23.0;5.0;13.0;395;"I've had this pack for several years and have taken it all over the world with me! Three months studying abroad/living on trains in Italy, numerous trips into the Idaho wilderness, 500+ miles on the Camino del Norte in Spain (plus time in Dublin, London, Paris, Lisbon, Rabat, and Marrakesh), and soon getting ready to face down the Pacific Crest Trail, have allowed for plenty of testing. One of my favorite features of this pack is the adjustable internal frame. Being that (on a good day) I'm 5'2"", being able to shorten the frame increased the comfort and balance of the pack. It weighs in at nearly five pounds, but the strap system allows for excellent weight distribution. My only qualm is that after a few of weeks on the Camino I couldn't tighten the hip belt as much as I would have liked, but even this isn't enough of an issue to demerit a star from my review, especially since it appears that this piece is able to be switched out.\nOther accoutrements of this pack include numerous pockets to stow, organize, and easily access smaller gear. The built in rain-fly saved my belongings from being doused on multiple occasions, and also doubled as a way to increase visibility while trekking along busy roads (read: Human Traffic Cone).\nThe only wear and tear that I see on my pack are some thin areas at the very bottom where it has been scuffed due to being set down on roads and stone walls. The foam is all in excellent condition and the straps show no sign of fraying. Not even the overall material of the pack appears to be sun bleached! Not too shabby for all of the miles and weather that it has been through!";Used on the Camino de Santiago (Norte) and LOVED it!
12;10.0;5.0;26.0;415;Great for a camping/hiking/survival pack!!!\n\nI have had it for about half a year and it has worked great. I hammock camp and this pack has held every thing that I want and more.\nWhat I like about it is that it's very comfortable when packed up all the way, it doesn't hurt at all.(I carry a lot)\nThe sleeping bag compartment is perfect, I use my Teton sports leef +20 and it fits great.\nI would highly recommend this pack.;Five Stars
13;25.0;3.0;13.0;497;"Ok pack for the price, did have a couple issues with it though. The aluminum internal frame parts have rubber caps on the ends of them, and one of the Velcro straps that holds them in was not closed when I received it, so what had happened was the frame was pushed up out of the rubber cap on the bottom and would not go back in. This caused the frame to stick up past the point the Velcro could be closed. After about an hour of messing with it I eventually got the frame rod back in its rubber cap and solved that. The second issue came when adjusting the pack, the bottom cross strap that you wrap the shoulder strap adjustment around just was barely sewn in. It isn't an issue for me because I didn't actually need the very bottom one, but it is something to consider. Otherwise I have used it backpacking in the Midwest and in Glacier National park and I find the pack to be comfortable and well balanced, it really does a good job with airflow to your back so you don't end up soaked. This pack is a bit large, I'm 5'9-10""ish and I have it at nearly the smallest setting. The pack itself is incredibly roomy, can fit pretty much everything you need for a multiple day hike. Other than the two issues I had, which for me were not a big deal, the pack has served well, and we will see if it lasts as long as my old Kelty Guide that this replaced.";Ok pack, slight issues.
14;9.0;4.0;30.0;552;Used this pack for a 3 day 20 mile hike. I had the pack loaded with 33 lbs. of gear. The pack worked great with no problems at all. Once strapped on it was solid with no sliding or moving. We made 42 waist deep and very cold river (39 degrees) crossings so the pack staying in place was a must. We took out the bars and bent them to the contour of my back which worked great. No rubbing on shoulders or hips. The only thing I wish you could adjust is the position of the chest strap. With my body frame it was a little high , but still worked. Was nowhere close to choking me but I like it a little low. Was it a game changer (NO). The sleeping bag area is to small for a winter bag which I had so I stuffed my tent and ground cover in that part. Had sleeping bag in bottom of main area. Loved all the attachment points on the outside. I had a fly rod and vest attached to them. As you can see in the picture I had it loaded to the max.;VERY Nice pack for the money
15;17.0;1.0;23.0;552;"I bought this bag as my first camping bag and had high hopes from the previous reviewers. Our first trip with the pack ended a few days ago and we took it to the Boundary Waters. Naturally, when you're camping for several days the bag will be filled to the brim and quite heavy.\n\nUnfortunately, this bag has a ""Back Sizing"" velcro strap that would NOT handle the weight load I had packed into the bag. It was constantly coming undone as I tried to pick it up and sling it over my shoulders. At first I thought this was just a case of it being too heavy, but then it continued to come undone on the trip out as well when a significant amount of weight had been taken out of the bag.\n\nI hope this is a simple case of a bad bag strap and that others have not had the same experience, but this is EXTREMELY frustrating when you're trying to portage and the pack is falling down in the mud and water, wrecking your other gear as well.";Velcro Strap Continually Comes Undone, Extremely Frustrating
16;6.0;5.0;43.0;675;You cannot go wrong with this bag!! Way cheaper than the big name brands. The only thing that makes this not as good as the big ticket ones is the hip belt is not quite as fancy. But considering the price difference, a great deal! Well made. lots of pockets. My REI down sleeping bag fits in the sleeping bag compartment. The adjustable torso deal is a great feature. Lots of straps to make even more adjustments. Compartment to hold up to a 3 ltr bladder. Straps to hold items on outside. Trekking poles fit nicely into areas behind side pockets. GREAT BAG!!\n\n**update**\nWe still love our tetons. But i do want to add one thing we've noticed after using them on several trips. To adjust the tightness on the hip belt is nearly impossible to do yourself. The way the straps are designed you have to pull from center, back towards your hips. This is very hard to do... More expensive bags like gregory or ospray, you pull from hips forward which is a much more natural movement. I cannot tighten enough on my own and have to have my hubby tighten them for me due to the design.\n\nOtherwise, they are holding up great and we're taking them on a 5 day hike down the Rogue River in June.;GREAT BAG!
17;18.0;4.0;22.0;735;Generally love this backback. It packed everything needed for a multiday adventure, and even though this one was larger than my hiking buddy's pack (the 3400), this had better lumbar support and carried the weight better. Shorted one star because moisture got into the bottom of the pack during wet weather while hiking (not from being set on the ground). That compartment was easily accessible and the stuff in there (sleeping bag and spare clothes) had it's own waterproofing so was overall, ok, because of preparation.;Generally love this backback
18;48.0;1.0;7.0;744;"Cheap stitching. Feel apart inside after a week. Still hooks stuff, just no more compartment at the bottom.\n\nCompany emailed me, said they would fix and to email them for warranty repair through their website. I emailed them a couple of times and never heard anything back at all. All I could get to was a ""Contact Us"" link which was useless. Seems they were just concerned about getting the reveiw made better than taking care of a warranty.\n\nReason I am updating so much later is that I only used this on one real trip backpacking lightly for a little over a week. Most of the time it was used as a travel bag. Only was carried on one real hike. Even then it was well underloaded since I was solo. The big problem is that now, if I open the sleeping bag compartment on the bottom it will dump the contents of the inner bag out of the the bottom because the stitches came out that hold in the partition between the two compartnments. I am going to get to the needle and thread before I leave in a couple weeks for my second trip with this bag and cross my fingers it actually holds up since I cant spring for another bag with all the gear I am buying right now.\n\nDisappointing for all the cash I spent on this. Nice design, seemed tough when I received it, but I didn't abuse it at all and it just fell apart from the cheap stitching. I would not buy this again. Without a doubt I would try something from an entirely different company if I could do over. If it tears somewhere else I will be buying another bag this summer whether I like it or not. I cant have this failing on me 15+ miles from civilization on foot. Just not acceptable for a bag thats designed for real outdoor travel to fall apart on me during light outdoor travel. My Camelbak and cheap backpack I bought on Amazon are both better quality than this bag.\n\nJust got me more irritated when I thought they were going to take care of it with a replacement bag or repair since I reviewed it as being broken not long at all after buying it. The worst part is, if anything broke it, it wasn't anything to do with weight at all. It would have been the puffyness of my sleeping bag filled with down and made for cold weather that popped the stitches. Because of that, this bag will never be loaded near what should be the normal limit.";BUY ANOTHER
19;53.0;1.0;6.0;813;First time out on Appalachian Trail with new pack was a failure. Full pack weighted out at 38 pounds. 35 miles into trail right shoulder strap pulled out from bag. There was no way to reattach it. Used a tee shirt to tie strap to bag. Had to stop at first trail shop to buy another pack. Very unsatisfactory for this name  brand. It did come highly recommend. This pack should be replaced or refunded.;Poor sewing of shoulder strap.
20;54.0;5.0;6.0;919;I just opened this last night and it looks pretty good. I bought it for my boyfriend, our 2 year anniversary is coming up. He keeps on talking about going backpacking, now he can officially go. It looks durable and it came with all the straps in tact. It seems kind of heavy but that is part of the bag. The sleeping bag compartment seems like a good size, I like how you can unzip the inside to make one large compartment if you needed too. I purchased some dry bags and I hope he likes everything I bought.;Anniversary gift!
21;22.0;5.0;21.0;931;Used once. We had never backpacked before and fit instructions were easy to follow and pranced around the back yard adjusting for some time but when fit properly felt great. Even with mine weighing in at 40lbs we pulled a 20 mile 3 day trip for our first backpack ever.  i would advertise and recommend this pack and this brand especially for the cost based on other packs we looked at.;Great
22;11.0;5.0;38.0;978;I purchased this pack for a four day hike across the New Jersey section of the AT and it performed perfectly. I am a novice and way over packed. It weighed 43 pounds, which is heavy for that amount of time, but the pack adjusted very well and distributed the weight evenly between shoulders and waist. It can be adjusted in every way possible to meet the wearers dimensions and demands. The fabric used to construct the pack is tough and well sewn together. A colleague in the hiking party had an Osprey which was much more expensive that did not receive the accolades that mine did (I'm being nice). The side pockets were very handy for frequently needed items. Seasoned hikers that we met on the trail even said that the pack was great. I was so happy with it I went back to Teton Sports for a new sleeping bag and new tent. Will recommend and would buy again. Obviously designed by people that have experience in the outdoors.;Believe in the reviews!
23;50.0;5.0;7.0;987;"For the price, you can't beat it.  I just went on a 22 mile backpacking trip and it was surprisingly comfortable.  I did have some irritation around the hips towards the end, so make sure to adjust the straps every hour or so.  I was able to fit my TETON Sports Tracker +5 Degree F Ultralight Sleeping Bag in the sleeping back compartment, and my ALPS Mountaineering Aries 3-Person Tent in the main compartment.  In addition, I had a , stove, pot, mess kit, med kit, food, water filter, 3L Camelback, canteen, hatchet/knife, lantern, windbreaker, down jacket, sandals, inflatable pillow, sleeping pad, and 2 days of clothing.  I'm 5'10"" and 160 pounds.  Recommend!";Great For Backpacking
24;37.0;4.0;11.0;993;Just received my bag today and so far everything looks good.  Well made product, fabric and zippers feel really solid. First thing I did was unwrap it and weighed it with nothing inside. It was a 5lbs 1oz. Can't complain at all. Can't wait to take it out!;Great Product
25;34.0;4.0;12.0;1017;The backpack is perfect. Its strong and sturdy......has plenty of space and the pockets are big.\n\nI have not used it yet but am very happy with it. I would give it 5 stars if it had a pocket on the strap which is across the tummy. SOme expensive bags have them....but it really didn't seem worth it. Overall, this purchase is awesome and I have uploaded some pics. hope it helps.....;Perfect Backpack.....Pics included for your reference.
26;43.0;5.0;9.0;1052;I haven't been backpacking in the literal sense for many years. I wanted to get back into it so I did a lot of research, I read a lot of reviews and I kept coming back to the Teton 4000. It has a lot of room and a sleeping bag compartment. You can get into the bottom of the pack through the sleeping bag compartment. And the rain fly is very accessible and easy to put on. This pack might have too much room for a 2-3 trip. If you are a 2-3 packer, the 3400 might be the one you want. I found myself overpacking to make the pack fit and because I had the room.\nThe spaces between the side packs and the main pack are very useful and can hold a surprising amount. I've put everything from a broken down recurve bow and arrows, to a 12 gauge pump shot gun that I had taken apart. The stock on one side and the barrel on the other.\nIt has plenty of areas to use as tie downs. The hip support and straps are large and comfortable and hold the pack high on the hips.\nMy next pack will be a TETON 3400.\nOverall a great pack for a returning competent back packer.;Everything You Need
27;20.0;4.0;25.0;1066;UPDATE: I received the new backpack a within the week and while I have yet to test it on a real trip anywhere, it is doing a great job of lugging all my things through road trips and airports! Nothing has broken yet, but I will be sure to inform you all if it does and the actions I will take!\n\nI bought this pack a month ago (about) and took it on its first trip last weekend. I had planned an 8 mile round trip hike with a camp stop in the middle. This pack was very comfortable and carried all the stuff that I needed (and all the stuff that I may not have needed but took anyway). We made great time both days and had a blast. At the end of the hike back (about 200 ft from the car, thank goodness), the load lifter strap broke and I had to lug this now awkwardly balanced backpack the rest of the way.\n\nWhy 4 stars then?\n\nBecause I went straight to the Teton website and complained. As a consumer, I have the right to make my issues known and ask for an appropriate response and on Teton's contact page, I did just that. I received an email about 5 minutes later telling me that my complaint had been acknowledged and that I needed to send photos of the broken strap. Once I sent the pictures, I received profuse apologies about the broken strap and was assured that a new pack would be sent. At this exact minute, it has been 15 minutes from my original complaint and I already have a new backpack on its way here for free. That's customer service.;It Broke But I Still LOVE It...
28;46.0;5.0;9.0;1167;While there are many better, more expensive packs than this, there are also many, more expensive packs that don't touch this.  I particularly like the adjustable torso length on the back/spine, the lumbar belt and adjustable straps.  This pack can fit most people very comfortably, considering the heavy load you can carry.  The straps at the top/bottom can accommodate a tent/bag or something else.\n\nPeople have remarked the sleeping bag compartment is small, but I disagree - I have a compression bag that fits in there ALONG with an inflatable sleeping pad, and I could probably stuff more.  Any sleeping bag MEANT for backpacking will almost definitely fit in here.  Yes, a winter bag that small is very expensive, but that's what it's for.  It should be noted that the sleeping bag compartment also has a zipper so you can access the bottom contents of your pack from there if necessary.\n\nThe Pockets on top and sides are of good quality and are great for quick-access items.  Its also very nice that the side-pockets have space behind them so you can slide tent poles, etc. behind them, even when full, into the pack for whatever you need.\n\nThe main compartment is of good quality and this pack is big enough for most trips if you pack it right.  No complaints.  It also has a rain fly that had no trouble covering my backpacking tent strapped to the outside in addition to the whole pack.  The fly is removable if desired, and also bright yellow for emergency purposes.\n\nOverall, for the price, this pack is extremely high quality - I've gone on several treks with it and it has held up wonderfully.;Great Backpack
29;16.0;5.0;34.0;1187;What a great buy... I had been looking for a good sized backpack at a decent price for a while and this is it. I've looked at other packs in stores for upwards of $200 and the quality isn't comparable to this pack, it is very well built! The pockets on the side are also a very nice touch, there are so many little things to bring with you camping and they're impossible to find in the main compartment. The capacity is great, I can fit my hennessy hammock in the bottom compartment, my pillow, sleeping bag, food, and clothing in the main with room to spare, and the straps on the outside are great for a sleeping pad as well. Overall, perfect for any mid sized camping trip!;Better quality than $200 packs
30;30.0;5.0;15.0;1210;Fantastic Bag! I have taken this on several two day hikes into the Superstition Mountains in Phoenix, Arizona and this baby has held up to serious abuse.  There are a multitude of storage pockets as well as general storage space in this thing.  The straps are very padded  as well as the waist strap which prevents rubbing your skin raw while walking.  Cheap straps can do this after walking 30 miles.  I would recommend this bag to anyone in the market for a hiking pack.\n\n***7-25-16 update***\nI still use this bag and still LOVE it. I go hiking here in my new home in Oregon almost every weekend. This bag has been with me while I have summitted many mountains as well as over many multiday backpacking trips.;Best hiking pack I have purchased!
31;39.0;5.0;11.0;1236;after all the reviews i read, and i read them all.. The good the bad, the in betweens, i decided to get this because it was affordable and had mostly favorable reviews.  First thing, my straps have not broken, so maybe Teton did something about the weak strap stitching from previous models to rectify that issue.  I have also never over stuffed the bag.  When i load up for a week long trip i bring a bunch of stuff.  Sleeping bag, pad, tent (or hammock), cooking pot, ceramic bowl, collapsible bowls,  chop sticks, spork, food, clothes, wire, fishing line, 550 cord, cooking stove (and fuel), med kit, fire kit, and i'm sure i'm forgetting something.. and my bag weighs 33lbs when it is all packed in, 47lbs if my cat is riding on top.  My cat has not damaged the bag with his sharp claws, and i have never had any issues with anything.  There is plenty of room for everything you might take.  I bring along 2 nalgenes, and use a 3 liter bladder (which is a little hard to set up and feed through but it works fine), and everything else i take and i have never been out of room.  The pockets are deep and spacious, the two pockets on the top cover are great, i use one for my med kit and the other for food.  This bag is very well priced and worth every penny.  If you compare this bag to the Bear Grylls bag of the same size, this bag will win in ever category and you'll be paying A LOT less.  i would recommend this bag to anyone who wants to try out the internal frame ( i was external for years and this is my first and only internal frame bag) but doesn't want to spend a lot of money on something they may not like, or anyone who likes to camp with their kids.  This is an awesome bag.;The good the bad
32;55.0;5.0;7.0;1308;I bought this backpack in April of this year.  Since then I have used it on 7 multiday trips, and ive hiked all over western Massachusetts and the Catskill mtns.  I absolutely love this bag!!  I paid $63.00 dollars for it from amazon.  When I took it out of the box it had a price tag on it for $130.00!!!  I was very surprised at how much money I saved buying from amazon!!!  It took me some trial and error to figure out the proper way to wear this bag comfortably.  Last weekend, I hiked thru the Catskills with 35lbs of gear packed inside and the pack was comfortable.\n\n  For the price, I don't believe you can find a better quality pack.  I believe this pack is made with quality material and workmanship.  I have not had a single issue after hiking many miles thru the mtns!  The outside is made of rip stop material, and the material is very durable and strong.  The pack can hold a tremendous amount of gear!!  It can easily hold enough gear, including cloths food and water, for a 3 day trip.  I'm sure it can hold enough for 5 days also, however, I have not gone out for 5 days, yet.  It can store 65+ liters of gear.\n\n  Both right side pockets can store a lot of gear, I store all of the smaller items needed for multi day trips.  Also, both right side pockets are designed to have a set of tent poles or trekking poles, slide down the right side of the bag behind both pockets and into the mesh pocket at the bottom.  There is an adjustable loop at the top on the right side above the right top pocket, this is for securing the poles, it's a great feature if you tent camp.  You'll have no worries about where to store your tent poles.  The left side pocket is big!  I store larger items in this pocket such as my headlamp, flashlight, duct tape, 50' of para cord etc...  The top has two pockets, these are great for maps, guide books, tooth brush, body wipes, plastic bags, trah bags etc.. Smaller flatter items store very well in the top pockets.  The inside top pocket stores every thing related to first aid, it's a big pocket!  The main compartment is a top load only.  This compartment is hugh when you unzip the divider to the sleeping bag compartment, which I use to do.\n\nIn the warmer weather, I store my hennessey hammock, a tarp, stakes and para cord in the sleeping bag compartment.  The main compartment stores my sleeping bag, 2 pair of socks, boxers, teeshirt(no cotton), shorts,1 pair of pants(no cotton), 1 long sleeve shirt, 1 light sweatshirt, winter hat n gloves, it's still cold at night in the mountains, and my frogg toggs.  4days worth of food, 5 liters of water, my gas stove and small fuel cannister, a book and anything else I want to take. All of this adds up to around 35 lbs including the weight of the pack.  Which weighs 5lbs empty, it is a little on the heavy side compared to an Osprey which would weigh about 3 lbs empty.  But, I only paid $63.00 dollars not $280.00 dollars.  I'll gladly carry 2 more pounds to save that much money!!!!\n\nThe outside of the pack has compression straps at the bottom and another set on top.  There's also dasiey chains on both sides and loops at the bottom as well.  These compression straps are a great feature!!!  I have used both sets of compression straps and the bottom set is used every time I go out on a multiday trip.  I have also tied gear to my pack using the dasiey chains.  2 sets of compression straps, 2 sets of dasiey chains and 2 loops.  You can attach anything you need that doesn't fit inside the bag.\n\nThe shoulder straps and waist straps are thickly padded and very comfortable!  All of the buckles are plastic and have held up fine, so far.  The rain fly is a very bright canary yellow.  I've hiked once in the rain with the rain fly covering my pack.  Eventually, the rain fly became saturated and let some moisture pass to the pack.  But, the inside stayed completely dry, the pack itself is water resistant.  After that, I sprayed the rain fly with additional waterproofing, I haven't been caught in the rain since.\n\nBottom line is, if you want a 65+ liter backpack made of quality material at an excellent price?  You can't go wrong buying the Teton sports explorer 4000!!  I highly recommend this backpack!!  I love mine so far and I'm very happy I bought it.  Teton sports makes quality products at very reasonable prices, you can't go wrong with this pack!!!\n\nI have 2 minor complaints about this pack.  First, the sleeping bag compartment is a little on the small side.  My cold weather sleeping bag did not fit.  However, my warm weather sleeping bag fits and there's a ton of room left over, for more gear.  2nd, the shoulder strap adjustment is held together with Velcro.  This could be a potential problem when your carrying a lot of weight.  It hasn't been an issue yet, but how much weight can Velcro hold??\n\nI love this backpack, and I'm positive you will love it also!!!!;I absolutely love this bag
33;64.0;5.0;5.0;1327;I have always (At least for the last 20 some odd years) used military gear for hiking and camping. so this was my real first civilian back pack. It had a lot to match up to. As we all know modern military gear has to be battle field tough, it has to survive... this pack did not disappoint. Large and well made it can hold a ton. All zippers, tensioners and straps also seem to be of good quality.\n  I loosened all the straps and set up the shoulder bar height, that went easy. Snapped the hip belt on and tightened the shoulder straps, the load lifters and then the sternum strap, all of these features are definite plus in this price category. Then... added about 50 lbs (not quite a combat load... LOL) heavy for a civilian backpacking venture and walked around for about 20 mins. The pack supported the weight well, no hot spots, no soreness.... Like it. would definitely buy it again.;My first real backpacking back pack...
34;52.0;5.0;8.0;1333;This pack is an outstanding value.  Upon initial impression, the materials felt cheap and thin, but after taking this pack on a backpacking trip on the North Kaibab trail at the Grand Canyon, I was proven wrong.  This pack was VERY durable.  I don't baby my equipment, and this stood up to the beating.  Zippers also felt cheap, but they performed well too.  Some of the zippers are prone to snagging due to overhanging material, but that's nitpicking for such a cheap pack.  I have NO idea why people are complaining about the sleeping bag compartment.  My non-mummy, extra-long down sleeping bag fits without any tricks or excessive force with the zippered divider in-place.  Maybe if you tried to put a non-mummy synthetic bag in there it wouldn't fit, but this pack is designed for backpackers, and rectangular synthetic bags usually aren't on their equipment list.  A synthetic or down mummy-style sleeping bag could easily fit.  This is a fairly large pack which easily fit my gear, food for three people, and assorted group gear (stove, tarp, first aid kit, etc).  I'd say up to 50 lbs of gear would be comfortable enough to wear.;Great pack for the price. Can't say enough good things about it
35;49.0;5.0;9.0;1422;"I sell a lot of bags at a bike shop I own and run, and I am familiar with the quality of materials used in products. This pack is made with quality materials. The zippers are high end, and all exposed zippers are water proof. The 600D Squared Ripstop is light, durable and stain and water resistant. I have a 28"" waist, the waist belt snugs down and would most likely fit 27""-40"". The adjustable torso and shoulder straps are well balanced and have many adjustments. -20 bag fits fine. If you are a hammock camper, this pack is plenty for a 5 day. The overall balance is a giant leap from my last bag, so much that I'm ditching my trekking poles.\n\nHere's an Idea of what you can carry (it's what I carry):\n 20 degree bag, Eno hammock and fly,1 pants, 1 long shirt, 1 t shirt, 1 boxers, 2 pr socks, rain jacket, swimming trunks, big sandles (like Keen) 650ml pot, 6 small Nalgene 1-6oz bottles, 1 Nalgene 32oz,  MSR miniworks filter, solar panel, small radio, iPod, iPhone, head phones, multitool, little chair, LED string lights, collapsible fishing rod, full size pillow in compression sack, goggles, 4oz tobacco and papers, 2 lighters, first aid kit, roll of t.p., 100ft 500lb para-cord, 12oz whiskey, 4oz coffee, and about 8l left for food.";Great bag. Better than some of the high end products.
36;41.0;1.0;12.0;1615;I bought this bag because of its features, price and customer ratings. That was a mistake. I bought this as a bag to take my stuff on a cross country train ride. Three straps have broken and I have not even boarded the train. Very disappointed.;Bad Quality
37;44.0;1.0;11.0;1640;When I had it full loaded for the first time and picked it up the shoulder tore.  I can't even return it because i bought it over a month before i ever used it.  Totally bummed :(;Shoulder Ripped
38;68.0;2.0;5.0;1704;"I bought this pack because I am new to backpacking and I needed a pack but have a low budget.\n\nNow that I have taken this pack on two trips from 3-7 days long I have a few gripes I need to share. (and I hardly review anything)\n\nFirst of all, this pack has seriously low space in the main compartment. A few times I had to put my tent on the outside of the pack to throw off weight distribution. There is NO SPACE FOR ALL OF THE THINGS YOU NEED in this pack. Everyone is saying the sleeping bag compartment is too small. This is false, unless you have a terrible sleeping bag.\n\nThat being said, this pack would be great for smaller loads or shorter trips, BUT NOT 50+ POUNDS FOR TRIPS WITH MANY MILES.\n\nThis pack has TERRIBLE adjustments and it hurt my back and shoulders and even though I HAD MY STRAPS ADJUSTED CORRECTLY (which are of poor quality anyway) I had 60% of the pack weight on my shoulders which made my hiking such a pain in the ass and regretted choosing this pack every time I had it on.\n\nThe size adjustment on the back is AWFUL and comes apart every time you pick up the over loaded pack.\n\nPlease just avoid cheap packs and spring for a semi decent one at a couple hundred dollars YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED if you get this pack with a mind for long trips and heavy loads.\n\nAlso, the zippers are terrible and cheap and came apart easily after use of a few weeks.\n\nPS: Almost all of my gear would be considered ""light weight"" but even so, this pack could not fit all the basics.";Marginal at best
39;45.0;2.0;11.0;1743;"This pack has issues with both the design and the construction/materials.\n\nI got one of these and also a 5200 series for some overnights in the Adirondacks.\n\nThe design issues were more on the 5200 than the 4000, having to do with the way the detachable top bag and the straps fit, really I think they tried to hit a ""feature checklist"" and ended up without the usability really being as good as one would hope.  Far too much inconvenience having to undo straps to get to pockets, etc., to be really ergonomic.\n\nThe materials/construction issues have already hit BOTH packs- and I haven't even gone on the hike yet!!!\n\nThe 5200, the hem ripped off the water-bottle pocket when I was holding it to push the bottle down further.  The stitching was just too close to the edge of the material, and the border just tore right off.  The 4000, one of the buckles just shattered when I was tightening a strap over the rolled-up sleeping pad.  Clearly not nylon, some kind of more fragile plastic.\n\nSo, I guess you get what you pay for... maybe these are still a good choice if you just can't afford the higher-end brands... a shame, as some skimping on ergonomic thought, careful construction, and good materials could I think have made these good packs.  But I'll probably end up with these both just being 'take a loss' territory.  I don't want buckles to snap in the wilderness, or seams/hems/borders to just rip off hours from my car!!!\n\nThe 4000 really was the more serious failure, the buckle for a strap just shattering from pulling on the strap.  Both packs seem to be the same construction and materials, with the same risk of failure of the buckles, and the same lack of care on the seams/hems/borders.";Really wanted to like this, but...
40;47.0;1.0;11.0;1768;I had an issue out of the box with the torso adjustment system so I tried repeatedly to contact the company.  At the time of this review, there is ZERO contact information available on their website other than a web form.  I submitted a request on the web form and, well over a week later, zero response.  Tried to Google the company for a phone number or address (again, strangely not listed on their website) and the only phone number I found is not being answered (not even voice mail).  For a company that has numerous references to how great they are on their website you would think that they would at least have a phone number listed somewhere.\n\nI wasted way too much of my time attempting to contact them in an attempt to resolve this issue... returning this product.;Faulty product and horrible support
41;56.0;5.0;8.0;1772;"Without a doubt, the best bang for your buck that you will ever see for a traveling backpack right now (even with the slight price increase since I bought mine 6 months ago). As an avid backpacker that has used and abused this thing along 120+ miles of various terrain and weather conditions, I can safely say it's a trooper that doesn't break the bank.\n\nThe overall design is simple yet ingenious and is quite reminiscent of an old large framed ALICE pack, but with an elongated frame and main compartment which are infinitely more comfortable. This pack screams practicality and has obviously been designed by someone with experience in the outdoors.\n\nThe large side pockets are also very similar to those on an ALICE pack and are just use useful. The strap and rubberized grommets behind the two smaller side pouches allow easy carry and access to items such as fishing poles, tent poles, machetes, axes or anything your heart desires to slide down in there. The other large pouch is extremely roomy, and together all three provide easy access to your most vital gear without having to lump it up with your food, clothing and sleep system.\n\nThe sleeping bag compartment will not fit a good winter bag without a massive fight; a fight not worth having if you ask me. It will, however, comfortably fit any three-seasoner. Thankfully, the main compartment can be opened up into the sleeping bag compartment via a very convenient zipper between the two, and the entire length of the pack can be utilized. On winter trips when this is necessary, I opt for the external straps near the bottom to hold a sleeping bag. In fact, I see myself using this method for all future trips with this pack as the extra room is irreplaceable.\n\nA dozen loops also run down the middle of a netted pocket for carabiners for even more easy access to heavily-used gear. Two separate and surprisingly large hideaway compartments exist in the top flap; one right in the back and another on the underside.\n\nI do have a few gripes, however. Sometimes, with so many compartments on a hectic day, it can be easy to misplace an item. Also, the pack is on the heavy side for it's size (over 5 lbs). But I chalk that up to the decent quality of the fabric. The plastic clasps to hold hydration hoses are very fragile and snapped within a few days. A problem that is easily remedied with a little ingenuity and spare parts.\n\nI wouldn't recommend anything else for anyone from a novice looking for a starter pack, to an expert in need of a replacement, or even as a BOB to the more prepared amongst us.";Simple and Functional

Once customer service knew of the problem they resolved it to my satisfaction. I will continue to use this pack and recommend it.\n\nOLD Review:\nThis backpack may be of good functional design but the quality of manufacture is terrible. I had a broken off piece of the needle used to stitch the bag together that was stuck in strap and protruding out of the pack with the sharp end out.

43;70.0;2.0;5.0;1977;I bought this pack for a four day trip on the superior hiking trail and hopefully for many more, that will not be the case. The actual fabric the pack is made out of is fine, and held up well, the different fasteners were another story, they are just not up to the job of a real backpacking trip. On the first day the left side loop that holds drinking tube broke, the next day the left and the right side fastener that holds the chest strap broke leaving it to run sideways and uneven on my chest, my pack was 39# and at anything over twenty you can really feel every imbalance in the pack, it was no fun, also on day two the waist strap buckle would no longer snap in at the bottom but did at the top connection, another imbalance and it was not fun . The shoulder straps could use more padding for sure, the lack of padding made even more obviouse by the lack of propper support with the busted connections at the chest and waist straps. Those two connections are the most imortant next to the shoulder straps themselves and should be tough. I also found the stitching on the shoulder straps to be off a good 3/4 of an inch in the place it holds the top stabalizer and chest straps, causing an imbalance right out of the box, i did not notice this until examining the pack more closely after it broke. Other than those very important things, the pack was fine, rain fly worked and covered pack and bedroll, no problem with zippers, or material ripping , i had no problem packing enough food for 4 days along with first aid kit, tent ,sleeping bag, a change of clothes, 4 pair of socks, flashlights ,mess kit, rain gear, 2 liter camelbak,large nknife, pillow,alcohol stove, etc.., and had room for a few more days food if i needed to. The straps are just sooo important.... I trained with pack at full weight too, so all together put about 100 miles on it, 70 before it broke.;did not last one trip
44;5.0;5.0;183.0;1996;"I recieved this pack a few days ago and to be honest I was concerned that it wouldn't adjust to fit me.  I am 6'3"" tall and didn't see many reviews about Tall people.  This pack more than adjusted to fit me, it had room to spare.  I actually have it one notch below the max.  The great thing about this pack is that my wife (5'4"") can also wear the same pack and for that reason we will be ordering a second pack.\n\nBesides the height, I felt this pack was more than adequate for capacity.  I read many reviews about the small sleeping bag pouch, but I was able to fit my summer bag(+40), tent, stakes, AND tent rainfly in the pouch with room to spare.  I will just strap my tent poles on the side, which has straps specifically for that purpuse.  I do have a LARGE winter bag which would be snug, but I would definitly strap that on the outside with all the extra straps this pack has.  This pack has hidden pockets just about everywhere, which is nice when you have lots of gear you want to get at without unpacking everything.\n\nI started stuffing all my things in this pack to see what kind of balance it had and it felt great and was very sturdy. I posted a picture on here to see it on a tall person, but please note only had it 3/4 full. I will try and update this post after I use it on the Lake Superior Hiking Trail this fall.\n\nLet be honest though, the real reason I bought this pack was for the price... wow great pack for the money.  You could almost compare this pack to a $300+ pack from REI.  I hope that Teton keeps the price low and they will sell a TON of these.";Great Pack for TALL people!
45;60.0;4.0;7.0;2002;"I have a feeling that the reviews for this product which are talking about strap and clip failures are due to overloading and then over-tightening the adjustments on this pack.\n\nAs an experienced hiker and all round outdoorsman, here's some advice for folks who purchase this pack...\n\n1. Curved zippers, such as the ones on the bag's sleeping bag compartment always stick a little. Be gentle and be patient - this isn't a bombproof military surplus pack. If you try to force any zipper around a bend it will jump off the tracks. Lubricate the zipper with candle wax, pencil graphite or dry lube to make it slide easier.\n\n2. Don't try and pack too much into the sleeping bag compartment. It's made for HIKING sleeping bags, not your Coleman car camping extra large sleeping bag with the canvas bottom.

If you have a big winter sleeping bag, get hold of a compression stuff sack or buy yourself a more appropriate dedicated hiking sleeping bag.\n\n3. The pack comes with an instruction tag which shows you how to initially set up and adjust the pack. Take the extra 5 minutes to bend the frame stays and adjust the suspension length and the load lifters. You'll not only make it more comfortable on the trail, but you'll reduce the chances of breaking side release buckles or ladderlocs.\n\nThe only problem I have had with the pack is that at 5lbs empty it's a bit too heavy for my liking. Aside from that, it's a great pack with a host of features usually found only on the more expensive back packs. It's a great starter pack for the backpacking noob.";A lot better than I expected.
46;67.0;5.0;6.0;2051;I plan on doing some serious camping style traveling and this pack can take me to the moon and back!  I was so surprised by the quality!  Because of it's price, I assumed that it wouldn't be so great.  Other web sites with similar products like rei had packs in the range of $300.  I bought a 3 liter Nalgene Get-A-Grip water bladder to go inside and it fits perfectly, the pack even has a velcro strap to hold the bladder in place along with the inner pocket.  I was worried that this might be too big for my small female frame( 5'4, 100 lbs).

I decided to give the 3500 to my wife as it was a bit tight with carrying the tent on there. I then purchased the 4000 for myself and could carry all the extra equipment i needed including the tent , so that to lighten my wife's load. Also like the other reviews said, it was a really tight push putting my sleeping bag in the bottom compartment, which you do not have to do as you can open the zipper inside so that you can put it through the top of pack,i just prefer to keep it seperate. I am 5'10 and either pack fit my back as everything can be adjusted on both packs , but my wife is about 5'2 and the Teton 3500 fit her better due to the actual size compared to the Teton 4000 being slightly larger in capacity.

My pack has gone with me on 5 short trips (2-3 days) since I have bought it & is going on at least 1 more before the year is out.\n\nThere are a lot of good things to say about this pack.  It rides really nice on my back.  With the support stays, you can get it to fit really comfortably.  Pull them out, have someone bend them to your back, then put them back in the spots.  The panel that separates the sleeping bag compartment from the main compartment can zipped open, so you have a top & bottom loading pack.  In other reviews, I have read complaints about the sleeping bag compartment.  If you have a down bag, no problem fitting it in.  I have a Slumberjack Ultimate 30 Long bag.  It is a synthetic bag, which doesn't compress as much as a down bag.  It is about as big of a bag as I can put in there.  A warmer weather, like a slumberjack 45 will flip right in just fine.  A comparable down bag will fit just fine.  But mine takes a little jockeying, but not too much.\n\nThe compression straps on the outside are big enough to hold a decent sized tent.  The top will hold a sleeping pad without a problem.  If not, you can remove the straps or just pull them flat.  The vertical compression straps work well to shrink the height of the pack.  Makes it feel smaller than it is when out on the trail.\n\nOne particular feature I like is the fact that behind the side pockets, there is a pass through for trekking poles, tent poles, tripod, monopod, or whatever else you need of that general size & shape.  The pockets that this slides behind are floated, so you don't lose the ability to use the pockets.  This is just a smart design.  The larger side pocket (left side) can fit my water pump (Katadyn Hiker Pro) in it's bag.  The right side has 2 smaller pockets, that holds emergency rain gear, fire starter kit, granola bars, cliff bars, cards, camera, etc just fine.  The bottom of the 2 pockets is a little tough to use if you fill the top pocket on the right side.  You cannot access these pockets with the pack on your back.\n\nThe lid is not removable for a fanny pack or day pack, which I don't like.  But it works well.  It has a rather large top pocket that you can put in anything you need to grab that you don't want buried in your pack.  I have put a group first aid kit, toiletries, etc in there that you need.  There is a privacy pouch on the inside of the top, which is perfect for keys, wallet, phone, etc.  Anything you really don't need when you are out on the trail, but want no chance of losing.\n\nThe rainfly covers my entire pack with a tent on the outside bottom.  If I had the tent & something on top, it wouldn't cover everything.  With the rainfly being bright yellow, it also would work well as a flag if you are lost in the woods.  It can detach by undoing the buckle.\n\nInside, I am able to fit a compression dry bag, Jet boil, Thermarest prolite plus, pillow, food bag, bladder, jacket, and whatever else I need.  It doesn't fill it up.  My sleeping bag goes in the sleeping bag compartment & my tent hangs off the lower compression strap.  I hook rope on the back daisy chains.  There is plenty of room left.  My pack hauls about 30-34 lbs every time I go out.  It does it without a problem & I feel like I am hiking with a lot less on my back.\n\nSo, with all those good things I just said, why did I not give it 5 stars.  My third trip, the rainfly zipper broke.  it still slid back & forth, but the actual zipper handle came off.  Fortunately, I found it.  Some of the zippers don't move as easily as I would like.  I wish it had a pair of hip belt pockets, but it doesn't come with them.  When you are hiking, it can squeak.  I have also found that I have to keep pulling the shoulder straps tight as the pack keeps loosing up over the distance of a hike.  The buckle holding the sternum slipped loose on the shoulder strap, but I just rethreaded it on & it works fine.  It has verticle compression straps, but I wish it also had horizontal compression straps.  Yes, these are all minor.  No, not a one of these would keep me from buying this pack.\n\nOverall, it is a well designed pack.  It doesn't weight too much.  It isn't an ultralighter.  It is a fantastic pack to get out to the great outdoors in.  This pack will get you there & back.  It will also let you figure out what you want in your next pack.  & for the price, you really can't beat it.";Great Starter Pack!
49;28.0;5.0;24.0;2295;"Ok, so I purchased this bag last fall (1 year ago now), and truthfully, words cannot describe how happy I am with this pack. I bought it beacause I was starting to get a little more serious into survival tactics and camping in cold weather (which actually evolved into backpacking) and this bag still fills my needs! I have taken this thing up over many mountain peaks (nothing extreme, I assure you) but the thing is as SOLID AS A ROCK!!! I remember reading in the reviews when I was buying it that people said the seams were stretching and the sleeping bag compartment is to small and blah blah blah. I will assure you, if you treat this bag with care and respect, the 60ish bucks you have invested in it will pay you back after your first trip. So, here is how you overcome the ""problems"" of this bag. If you don't put over 65 lbs in the bag and don't try to stuff every of the 4000 square inches of this bag full, the seams will sit right where they are supposed to, and hold strong to abrasion of trail obsticles like water, snow, mud, rock, tree braches, etc (I have used it through all of those listed). As for the ""small sleeping bag compartment"", I will admit that when I bought the bag, I was angry with the size of it too but, I discovered a zipper that attaches the divider between the sleeping bag compartment and the main compartment and if you un-zip it, it simply folds the divider over to the side ALLOWING FOR MY BULKY 20 DEGREE TO EASILY FIT INTO THE BAG!!!\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you are going to be a ""weekend warrior"", like me and many others, this bag will NOT let you down. It is a great bag. With proper packing (last year), I was able to fit a 3 day trip(winter weather) amount of gear INCLUDING A LARGE SLEEPING BAG, into this pack! And since then it has hiked with me another 35-45 miles. This bag will live on to expirience future backpacking trips, with no hint of giving up.";Teton Sports Explorer 4000
50;29.0;2.0;22.0;2340;"This is a funny review for me to write.  Had I written this a few days earlier it would be much more positive. The story goes like this.  I took the Sports Explorer 4000 on a 4 night backpacking adventure in the olympic national wilderness.  The bag performed admirably throughout the trip.  Once adjusted properly the bag was extremely comfortable on my 6'2"" skinny male frame.  It survived nearly 40 miles of hiking up and down mountains, climbing over downed trees, and several river fords.  I give the bag five stars for its performance during that trip.\n\nThe reason I am giving it only two stars is because a week after I returned from the trip I was removing the backpack from my car using the main shoulder strap.  When I pulled to lift it up the strap's seam ripped and completely separated from the backpack.  I found it slightly hilarious that the bag could stand up to the backpacking trip but couldn't handle being lifted out of my car.  Also, I am very thankful that this did not happen while on my trip as it would've made the long hike significantly less enjoyable.\n\nAll that being said, I really want to like this bag.  It performed great when I needed it to and maybe it will for you too.  I am not sure if I just had a bad bag or if all the seams are defective.  Regardless, I encourage you to give it a try as it is a great bag for the price assuming it doesn't break.  But be warned  , if a major rip like I had happened on the trail you could find yourself in some trouble in the woods!";Worked Great Until Main Shoulder Strap Ripped Off
51;38.0;1.0;16.0;2369;First trip out with this pack, both shoulder straps tore away. My daughter uses equipment hard, but not that hard. For very light treks only.;Didn't hold up
52;62.0;5.0;7.0;2405;Great pack! Just took on a three-day, 30km hike. It was very comfortable throughout the hike - plenty of padding in the shoulders and hips. The sleeping bag compartment was a little small but I discovered (as I was packing to leave ...) that it can be unzipped to expand into the main chamber, so you can get a larger bag into the bag if needed. The included rain fly was wonderful - halfway into the hike the rain started and it kept everything under it dry. The fly was also large enough to cover the things I had strapped onto the outside (bivouac and small air mattress). Highly recommend.;Great backpack for short trips
53;12.0;4.0;60.0;2478;First of all, this was my first hike and I knew about it a year in advance for the reservation, due to our large group(30) and the well known Phantom Ranch. With that said, I had plenty of time to research(browse/compare at nearby stores: Academy Sports, Dick's, Cabela's, and Bass pro shop. Online: pricing/reviews). For the price, the size, and the good reviews, nothing compared to the Teton 4000 at $57 free shipping(the grey was cheaper at $6 less than the blue, not sure why, i wanted the grey anyway) I was pleased to receive it within a week of ordering. When i first received it, i noticed the tag(small booklet) that came along with it, it gave a brief instruction and description of every part of the backpack, very helpful. For my hike, i was able to fit a 4 man tent, sleeping bag at the base compartment-where it was intended, mess kit, a point and shoot camera and a DSLR camera on the side zipper pockets,(3 available, 2 on one side, 1 on the other, along with 2 mesh pockets on each side for water bottles) portable stove with butane, flashlight, knife, extra clothes, snacks, sleeping mat, and flip flops. Total weight, about 45 lbs. It was snug, but the strap and the stiching held up well. I gave this a 4 out of 5 star, only due to the shoulder straps digging into my shoulders, i adjusted it to have most of the weight supported by my hips, but that still didn't help. My solution was to release the sternum strap and have the shoulder straps more open and parallel to my arm pit or shoulder ball joint.(hope that makes sense) This relieved the soreness, but after a while, i had to relieve my shoulder ball joint and strapped the sternum once again, just to even it out. I notice one thing with other hikers with the high dollar backpacks was the shoulder straps having more width and cushion. This would probably help the Teton 4000 get my 5 star. Overall, i was very happy with my purchase and i would recommend this internal frame backpack. Thanks for reading.;3 day camp/hike  in the South Rim of the Grand Canyon with my Teton 4000
54;69.0;3.0;6.0;2530;I really liked the price, size and configuration but...the build quality was not what I was hoping for.  My wife and I are going on a two week trip across Thailand and I just couldn't trust the build quality of what I saw when it arrived.  The seams and plastic connectors may have held up for a casual hike of a couple days but I wouldn't trust it where I could get stranded some place with a broke backpack.\n\nWe ended up going with the Kelty Coyote 4750 Internal Frame Pack.  However, we haven't gone on the trip yet so my review of that product is still pending.;Not what i would pick for a long trek
55;15.0;5.0;50.0;2555;I bought this pack back in December and I've used it on about 11 camping trips since then. I camp usually every weekend. Or every other weekend. I've tested it on an extreme scale. I went and did the long cane trail 4 different times the same trail its only 23 miles, but I've done it 4 times with different weights. The first time I did a lite pack around 20 lbs and it was completely comfortable with no soarness after wards. Granted now I stretch before and afterwards and i'm an active body builder who goes to the gym 5 times a a week. Now the second time I went I was packing 35 lbs, only a 15 lb differnce but 15 lbs can make or break you. The pack held up the whole trip I stopped for the night with friends we made camp on a hill of near muckawaye creek which is about 3 miles from the start of the trail. Slept. Woke up the next morning hiked 7 miles to the next scenic area, then hiked it back to the camp. Now we only totalled at about 16 miles for this trip because we forgot our lunch and had to backtrack, but the back was simply amazing. The heavyiest weight I used was my standard army load which was 57lbs almost 60. Now about a mile I started feeling the straps in a good bit. We made camp at the same point about 3 miles in. Slept and repeated the trip again. Walked all the way to greenwood this time though which is about 10 miles all the way around. The bag held up to my expectations. I'm a very rugged hiker and camper. I prefer about 35lb, but i'm fine with adding more. I'll add everything I packed so you can understand that this is a very spacious pack.\n\nPack list\n\n4x military t-shirts\n2x cargo pants\n1x towel\n2x wash cloths\n1x soap\n1x tooth brush/toothpaste\n1x featherlight sleeping bag\n1x wind up flashlight\n2x starter logs/ the small ones for 88 cents.\n2x tarps/ one for a footprint.

Amazing bag for a good price and i've had north face packs, Osprey packs and one kifaru zulu pack and to me the kifaru zulu and the Teton bag are the best two I have.\n\nGreat bag, spacious, comfortable and good weight distribution. 5 out of 5;Amazing pack
56;63.0;2.0;7.0;2584;Used this backpack for 5 campouts.  This last campout I was tightening the waist belt and the clip busted.  When I received the backpack, I figured it was pretty flimsy but didn't think it would break.  Should have returned then and gotten something better.  Also very limited on outer pockets.;Wish I'd bought something else
57;61.0;4.0;8.0;2661;I love this pack.  It is plenty large for a couple night outing...more if you would like.  The pack is a bit heavy, but for the price it's quite a good deal.  There are a lot of straps, many of which are superfluous which adds to the weight.  I read another reviewer cut away much of the strapping.  I haven't done that but might consider it if I carried it many days.  All around good pack.;Great Pack
58;66.0;4.0;7.0;2706;I just came back from my 12 day trip. The bag was sturdy and has many pockets. If you are looking for a pack with greater space in the main pocket, it may be slightly short, but overall it is very convenient. The rain cover was very useful.

It arrived today and I'm not disappointed! The shipping box was in sad shape, dunnage was minimal and the packing tape was messed up but the pack was unmolested inside a plastic bag. That was the worse part.\n\nI don't concur with some of the negatives described in other reviews here. The zippers do not stick, they open and close just fine. I don't know how one can declare the sleeping bag compartment too small... compared to what? This is a 4000ci bag and advertised as such... it is what it is. I did fit my Sleep Cell 30 degree mummy bag in there no problem. I could even squeeze in a few extra items. I can fit two of my 50 degree summer bags in also... together. Yes, if you have a giant, fluffy, 5 lb, -20 degree winter bag, it probably won't fit here. This is a med sized, 4000ci backpack designed to carry backpacking style sleeping bags, not ones designed to drive to the cabin or car camp. I hope this clears things up if you're hesitant due to other reviewers dubbing it ""too small""... it fits most common bags just fine for a 4000ci pack. Besides, having to compress your bag and squeeze it in compacts your load and saves weight - stuff sack not needed. This is the best way to pack a 4000ci backpack! Use waterproof bags to protect sensitive items where needed.\n\nThe material seems to be of good, sturdy quality. The straps and buckles are very sturdy also and I see no difference after comparing them to the straps and buckles on Kelty, Jansport or Northface bags I examined in stores. If they do break, Walmart sells buckles and straps for pennies - made by Outdoor Products. I will carry extra with me when I use it.\n\nThis bag has plenty of straps, loops (daisy chains) and pockets to carry everything you need. It even has a cinch strap above the side with the two pockets. It has a rubber backing to protect the bag and will cinch down your tent poles, walking stick or whatever you can fish down between the two pockets and bag - remember these pockets are pass-through which allows you to slip items behind them. The pack is very comfortable and rests on your hips very well. I did try it out packed full for an hour. When I removed the back stays to bend them for a better fit the rubber boots came off the lower ends and I had to spend a few minutes fishing them out. To prevent this from happening next time I duct taped them in place.\n\nThe lifetime warranty on the tag says: ""... original owner only and excludes normal wear and tear (e.g., zippers that wear out after extended use) or misuse. If, after inspection, a product is determined by us to be defective in workmanship or materials, we will repair or replace it at our option, at no cost to the original owner.""\n\nThe trifold tag also includes full description of features, how to fit it properly, and how to load it with your gear... really good info.\n\nI will give an update after I use it in the field.\n\nUpdate 6 Sep 2010:\n\nPacked it with 40 lbs and hiked 12 miles in St. Mary's Wilderness,VA. Stayed 2 nights in these remote mountains and it performed fine. Passing Hikers commented that I ""looked ready for anything with such a great pack"". I guess all the attachment points, straps, pockets and bottle holders impressed them. I tossed and dragged it on the ground and ran it into trees and rocks. It also made a great camp chair and pillow - the back pads are soft and supportive. There were no malfunctions - no complaints.\n\nUpdate 21 Jan 2011:\n\nI purchased a larger, 20 degree Field and Stream MT20 mummy bag (for backpacking) suitable for colder weather and guess what?... it also fits in the sleeping bag compartment of this 4000ci backpack! A few extra seconds of compressing does the job. I kind of like the fact that the load is made smaller by having to squeeze it in there a bit. This keeps your load more compact and easier to carry... a plus to me. This is a great 4000ci pack!";Sleeping Bag Compartment Size is Relative !!
60;4.0;3.0;345.0;2816;"I must start by saying that I've grown very fond of this bag.  I've been backpacking and WWOOFing through Europe for over 9 months and I still have a few to go.  This bag is basically my home.\n\nLet's start with the pros.  PRICE - quite affordable for a bag of its class.  There are many convenient pockets and straps.  I'm able to fit everything I need to survive.  It's effectively waterproof and has the rain-fly thing for heavier rains.  The material is extremely durable - hardly a scuff on it and not a single tear in any of the fabric (seams are another story; see below).  It shrinks down alright when not fully stuffed.  And most importantly, when adjusted correctly, it IS comfortable.  This is crucial for me, as I've been doing a fair amount of hitchhiking and find myself walking 5-15km at a stretch if is lady luck isn't shining.\n\nIf it's got all of those pros, what cons could possibly drive me to only give it 3 out of 5 stars?  The seams.  Zippers, straps and buckles have busted seams.  It started VERY early.  Within only a couple weeks of use, the inner adjustable velcro strap that folds over the left-side interior aluminum back brace tore its top seam; the bag has sat crooked since then.  The seam around the zipper on the bottom where the rain-fly is stored is giving way, and I've used that only a handful of times.  After about 2 months of heavy use, the seam holding the buckle on the bottom right strap broke, as did the lowest of the four seams connecting that strap to the front mesh pocket area (I used these straps to hold my heavy coat when I'm not wearing it - I was able to reattach the buckle using duct tape, needle and thread).  Luckily, none of these have been enough to put the bag out of commission.\n\nOne final minor annoyance, but not necessarily enough to detract from the merit of the bag, is that I wish rain-fly were slightly larger.  I have to store my sleeping bag on top, and with the bag strapped up there the rain-fly simply doesn't cover it all.\n\nIn conclusion, I really do like the bag and I hope to get many more years out of it.  But to have seams busting within the first month of use is unacceptable.  Regardless, what's done is done.  I will simply try my hardest to repair these issues when I get back stateside and have the luxury of actually emptying the bag of all its contents - a rather daunting task, I assure you.";I'd give it 3.5 if I could.
61;21.0;5.0;39.0;2887;"This Backpack is awesome! This is the first internal frame pack I've purchased, and it's freaking sweet. Reading the reviews I decided on this one due to some reviews saying it worked for tall people. Short people can use this too!, the shoulder straps are adjustable - I never thought a backpack could do that, but the whole shoulder strap contraption actually shifts up and down, giving a great fit for anyone 6'5"" (like myslef, and 220lbs) to shorter, I'm guessing kids could fit super comfortable with it. But I'm not just talking about straps leading from bottom of backpack to the pit area, thoes adjust too, but the whole thing does, never seen anything like it.\n\nThe only thing bad about it I can think of is the sleeping bag compartment is too small, I just unzipped the seperater thing making it one large bag. Which I kinda like cause it forces me to get a smaller (and more lightweight) bag for the hiking and snowshoeing. Oh, and the inside compartment barley fit my huge, 35"" snowshoes.\n\nThis is freaking sweet, for the price, freaking sweet. I used it on one miserable snowshoeing trip so far, and it held up great. I packed too much stuff making the snowshoeing trip horrible(first time ever snowshoeing, learned my lesson), but my back and shoulders were comfortable with this bag - The waist strap helps a ton, and with big plastic clip-to-gether things it was super easy to do up and undo with gloves on. Time will tell on the zippers, and fabric, and plastic clip-to-gether things hold up, but from the first abusive trip, and from just looking at it, I'm sure it will. I would for sure buy again!\n\nHope this helps the tall people on their purchase, we need to look out for each other!";"Tall Guy 6'5"" Good Backpack!"

The backpack was certainly spacious enough, and had plenty of compartments for his supplies.  We liked the double draw string entry at the top, too.  He wore it around the house for days in anticipation for the big event.  On the morning of the trip, his Scout leader went to tighten his straps to ensure proper support and comfort.  Two of the three main front clips snapped in half, leaving this support system completely useless.  He hiked in (and out) carrying who knows how many pounds of stuff, all with the weight on his shoulders.  He was miserable on the hike, and sore for many days.;Broke on the first trip
63;7.0;4.0;89.0;2998;"This is my initial review on the bag. I will add a followup review after a 3 day backpacking trip next weekend.\n\nPros: (Quite a few, generally happy with initial inspection)\nLots of adjustments\nA decent number of pockets and options for storage(example would be a mesh velcro pocket on the face of the bag good for maps, energy bars, etc.)\nStraps seem to be of decent overall quality, and there is what looks like a sleeping bag/sleeping pad strap near the bottom of the bag. There is also two straps on the very top of the bag that seem like they could be used to strap something down. Nice to have the option to securely strap some gear to the outside of the bag.\n2 Mesh water bottle pockets on either side, couldn't tell by the product description or pictures but they are there! Phew.\nBright Yellow Rain Cover is located in a nifty pocket at the very bottom of the bag, nice feature.\nA few loops on the outside for strapping things down.\nHolds up to a 3 liter bladder with an exit whole and clips to keep in reach.\nSeems to be of Durable build and quality. Field tests soon.\n\nCons: (Only one real con for me, two cons if you are taller)\nSleeping bag compartment is SMALL, well actually its initially more of an issue with it's opening. I have a decently small winter bag that I can't fit in when its in it's stuff sack, at all. If I take the bag out of the stuff sack and stuff it into the compartment, it just BARELY fits, nice to know that it could though. For me, I will most likely use the straps on the outside of the bag to hold my sleeping bag, I have hooked it up and it seems to work pretty well(Almost like it was made to hold a sleeping bag). 4000ci is not that much room for a winter backpacking trip so having my sleeping bag on the outside will create a decent amount of space for say my clothes, sleeping pad, and cooking gear in the sleeping bag compartment. If you are someone who must have a sleeping bag compartment, this will work for summer camping but a winter sleeping bag will be very tough to fit in, the one and only con for me but big enough to deter some people. If you are someone who doesn't mind sticking the sleeping bag on the outside where it would work out just fine in the bag's straps, then this con is not that much of an issue.\nNot for TALL people. This bag seems to fit me ok but I am not a very big guy. I'm about 5'9 - 5'10 and it is a close fit. I think it will work just perfectly for me but if you are above 6 ft or anything, beware(then again I am pretty new to backpacking and this is MY first pack).\n\nOverall:\nIn the end, I bought this smaller bag over the cheaper and larger cuscus bags because of the many reviews those had with cheap build quality. They get a lot of space with their big bag but have a lot of issues with bag quality. I sacrificed some space for quality and extra features. I am a little disappointed by the small backpack compartment but if I have my pack on the outside, this bag should work quite perfectly. I'd say for summer camping this bag is Perfect and for winter camping, if you can stick your sleeping bag on the outside, this bag is near-perfect. I will do an update in about a week after I give this bag a good hard test.\n\n4/5 stars for not being 100% ""perfect"" but an overall good bag.\n\nUPDATE:\nWent for my November 3 day backpacking trip and this bag performed perfectly. Was comfortable and carried all of my gear with ease. I was able to pack up everything and more. The pack worked as good as I hoped it would and with the sleeping bag in the straps on the outside, it was a non-issue. No complaints, no problems, this bag is awesome. Great deal.

As soon as I took the backpack out of the box, I grabbed my sleeping bag and tried to stuff it in there.  After about 5 minutes of jockying it around, I did manage to BARELY get the thing zipped up.  However, the sleeping bag I used is my summer bag.  If I tried to stuff my winter bag in there, with bivy sack and stuff sack, there's no way it would all fit.  This can be a problem if you're intending on doing a legitimate backpacking trip in high altitudes with cold weather.  All this being said, I'm in the Army and I take a different approach to this issue than most civilian hikers probably do.  In my opinion, you don't need to have your sleeping bag available for quick access.  The only time you use it is at night, when you'll have time to dig in your bag and get it anyway.  Since the sleeping bag pocket is too small, just throw your sleeping bag in the big compartment...this compartment is large enough to easily hold a winter bag.  Use the sleeping bag compartment for more important items that you might actually need to access quickly (medical kit, rain gear, flashlight, signaling device, GPS, knife, etc.)  Therefore, problem solved.  No need to return the bag.\n\nAnother negative I saw mentioned in a previous review is all the excess straps that hang loose.  Not a problem...just get some 100mph tape and tie it all down.  Too easy.\n\nThe rest of the pack seems to be quality.  The material seems durable and there is a good deal of padding along the back and straps for a comfortable fit.  Everything is adjustable so you won't have any problems getting this backpack to fit all shapes and sizes of hikers.  It also has a quickly accessible rain cover which will definitely come in handy during those suprise thunderstorms.\n\nAll in all, this pack seems to be pretty reasonable for the price you pay.  I'm going to Colorado for a 3 day hike soon and will be taking this pack with me.  I'll update this review upon return to let you know how it holds up in the elements.;Sleeping bag pocket too small, but bag is still a good one
68;40.0;5.0;17.0;3145;I searched for many months looking for an affordable backpack and I really got lucky with this one! It is a very durable pack. It has plenty of size adjustment options and clinches down very comfortable onto your back and shoulders. The side mesh pockets have a nylon lining on the rim which re-enforce the pockets and can handle a 32oz. water bottle. My sleeping bag fit properly into the bottom pocket and left enough room for 3-4+ days of gear in the main compartment. I would make sure to purchase the Explorer 4000 rather than the Scout 3500. The extra space will come in handy for multi-day trips. You should note that this is not a ultralight backpack. It may be fine for an adult but a bit to heavy for younger kids or women.  If you are looking to finally get out on the trail for a few days you won't go wrong with this pack.;Great Backpack
69;51.0;4.0;13.0;3431;I bought this backpack and took it to south east Asia for three weeks, great purchase! Although it is a little heavy (5.6 pounds), it is very well built, the quality of its materials is very good and the attached rain fly is very useful. It feels good and the weight is well balanced between your hips and your shoulders, so its easy to carry and to adapt to different users. For this price, I recommend it, great purchase! The only downside of this backpack is its weight, that's why I don't give it five stars.;Great pack for that price!!!

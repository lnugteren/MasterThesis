One of my neighbors said he heard all kinds of crackling in the woods behind both of our houses at around 2 in the morning so I stayed up the Friday night and Saturday night after I received the flashlight fully charged flashlight playing soccer on my phone finally heard all the crackling Shore enough around 2:03 Friday night but could see only eyeballs in the woods off in the distance. but Saturday night I waited til the crackling in the woods. Pretty much near the end of my yard close to my deck where are sitting comfortably looking out when I turn the light on I found one huge mother of a raccoon and three babies. Called Animal Control the next day they came out and laid safe traps Collected the whole family. I've had plenty of flashlights for my jobs and for around my property but this thing is pretty ba. made my backyard into daylight;Turn my backyard into daylight just like the video
1;38.0;5.0;5.0;18;Best flashlight I ever had. Thank you.;Wow.
2;20.0;5.0;8.0;22;Very good and bright flash light in a strong metal housing.  Comes with one rechargeable Li-ion battery and charger plus one insertable adapter for 3 AAA battery use.  Using the supplied Li-ion battery gives a little brighter beam that lasts longer than using 3 AAA batteries.  The included battery case is very sturdy and durable making it a good companion when bringing the flashlight along in the car or any tool chest either in the garage, cabin or work place.  Another plus with this flashlight is the ease of refocusing the light beam by sliding the front part of the unit.  It is also a flashlight to have at someone's nightstand in case of power outage at night.;Very bright flashlight for any situation.

46;65.0;1.0;10.0;365;Update 4/19/17. This light has had very light use and today it just died.\n***********************************\nPhenomenal flashlight. It does indeed light up an incredible amount from a far distance. It came without ANY instructions. You may ask why a flashlight may need instructions? It came with a rechargeable battery and a charger. When you plug the charger in it displays a green light, when you insert the battery it displays a red light. Contrary to mist chargers I have a red light means the battery is not fully charged, a green light indicates a full charge. This appears to work in the exact opposite manner. The flashlight also does not give any icon for which way the battery should be inserted into the sleeve of the flashlight. The additional battery insert that allows the use of 3 AAA batteries does not show which way to insert batteries into it, nor does it indicate which way the battery holder should be inserted into the sleeve of the flashlight. Instructions would help a user know how to address these issues and questions.;Great But Needs Instruction Manual
47;136.0;1.0;5.0;367;I dropped it 3ft. onto my stairs and it broke. Not sure that really makes it good. Considering it was said to be able to withstand a 300ish foot drop.;3ft. drop = lost $50
48;110.0;1.0;6.0;369;Inadequately packaged. Lithium-Ion battery had no protective covers on the ends. Right out of the case, battery was dead. No instructions on how to use. No safety instructions for battery. Charged the battery for 4 hours - still does not work. Will buy a set of AAA batteries tomorrow, just to see if the flashlight even works. I wasted $55+ on this. My big mistake? Not reading the reviews first, which is rare for me. This is a bad product, from a bad company. I will not purchase anything from them ever again.;Do not buy from Shadowhawk-ripoff

55;113.0;1.0;6.0;391;This flashlight has potential. I like the style, and it is, indeed, bright. But it took weeks longer to arrive from the company than I was told it would. The charger is a cheap piece of junk, the case a joke, and after a few recharges the battery would not take a charge at all. Don't waste your time or money on this.

59;67.0;1.0;10.0;396;"There are about 10 brand names for these flashlights which may have a slight visual difference on the exterior that is purely cosmetic, and there isnalso the generic one without a brand name.  These are all produced by the same manufacturer in China and they will allow tou to customize th3 vidual looks if you purchase over a few thousand items.  I was offered the items with a bag and my own brand name for $2.78 including shipping or they will allow drop shipping as well.  The ""official site"" they use where thry claim the price is 75% off contains pictures that sre not even theirs, the one that illuminates the whole building or mountain is the photo of the flashlight built by an individual and that has 90,000 lumens for which he has a patent for.  The casing is cheap and don't expect metal, and I would never sell anything like this to anyone except for my enemies if I ever make any.  I never intended on mass selling these either but I wanyed to find out what the wholesale price was, so I found a contact through alibaba which is where I got the price.  With enough complaints, the FBI should eventually get on their case for scam.  Of you want to try something like this, I would suggest not to pay anything more than 5 or maybe 10 bucks, and if you really want a good flashlight, you may want to stick to known brands.  I usually will go to a sporting goods store or to Walmart and try them myself, and then will find them on Amazon and buy them.";and I would never sell anything like this to anyone except for my enemies if I ...

63;78.0;5.0;8.0;402;"FWIW... First, I BELIEVE all the 1-star Amazon reviews BUT... My uncle bought what appears to be this SAME Shadow Hawk 800 via late night infomercial. He bought 3.  ONE did not work only bc Litium battery was bad.

Each come with optional 3-AAA battery PACK (2nd battery option) to use in lieu of the Lithium battery.  Even the flashlight with bad Lithium battery WORKED with the alternate 3-AAA battery option.\nEveryone who's seen it is like ""Damn!"".  Makes me wonder if this ""seller"" HERE is selling original product?  5-stars ""thus far"" but will update if there is a failure.  Obviously ""something is up"" since there are too many 1-Star reviews.  Don't know what.  That's my 2-cents.  I got it as a gift, so my perspective may be a little off.  But for me, it's a sturdy, heavy, 800-lumen, high grade, bad ass flashlight (NOT a $6 flashlight) MAYBE this seller is swapping out the real Shadowhawk & substituting a piece of crap. Just a guess because something here does not make sense.  (I'd STILL be wary of 3am infomercial products, even though my uncle received a very high quality product).

The box has four plastic clips to lock it down, one doesn't close properly so immediately I knew the company doesn't practice good quality control.  The flashlight inside feels heavy and sturdy, and features all the modes it advertised : several zoom modes, strobe and SOS.  It didn't include an instruction manual and I couldn't find one on the web, so it took me a while to figure out I had to keep the on button pressed for a while to change modes.  In the ad literature as well as in the videos, this flashlight is said to be capable of blinding and disorienting potential aggressors when the light is shined directly in their eyes, particularly in strobe mode.  I tried this on myself first and then on a few of my friends and even though it is somewhat powerful it should, in no way, be considered a tool for self defense.  Other than this it is a decent flashlight but one that can easily be substituted with much less expensive alternative options.;Shadowhawk x800

I called the company and since it was out of warranty the best they could was to sell me a new one for $37. While I was on hold with the company I McGuivered it and placed two silver nickels in the case between the end cap and the battery. It works GREAT! Also, my wife bought a similar A800 on Ebay,which had the same markings for $20. It is just as bright and has the same functions as the $56. one. Buyer beware!;Shop Around
95;61.0;2.0;12.0;449;It's OK but you can get the identical flash with different brand names for no more than about $15.  For example, search for BB flash or ByBlight flash.  Same exact flash with different name stamped on it.  And a LOT less money.;Identical to other flashes priced much lower
96;9.0;1.0;195.0;449;"My wife ordered five of these flashlights.  Only one had a charger and battery (we later discovered that additional chargers/batteries come with upcharges - they even charge for the warranty).  Plus the storage boxes started falling apart after being opened _once_.  As others have mentioned, this is a rebranding of a $5 flashlight.  Five minutes' worth googling and Amazon reviews showed that these are a SCAM.\n\nHere are a few things you'll need to deal with Shadowhawk Industries:\n\n* Their Customer 'Service' number:  (866) 342-2144.\n\n* The knowledge that everyone on the distant end, CSRs and supervisors, are what I refer to as 'back office mouthpieces'.  First hint:  They try to talk over you instead of listening to you.  Their job is not to help you, but to maximize profitability for Shadowhawk Industries.  They will be polite and reasonably professional as they attempt to convince why you're wrong for calling...\n\n* Unlimited long distance minutes on your phone.  Expect to be on hold for 15 minutes; then another 15 minutes while they complain about how their system is down/slow.  Total time around 25 minutes.  Total duration of call expected to be about 35 minutes.  Try not to be too assertive; they're sensitive and will threaten to hang up on you.\n\n* The URL (web address) of the 'receipt' they sent you.  This is the ONLY place you'll find your order number; it's NOT shown on the web page screen itself.  It's in the URL (the web address in the Location bar at the top of the screen).  You should see something like this:  [....]where the 'nnnnnnnn' is your order number.\n\n* Shadowhawk Industries' corporate address:  Shadowhawk Flashlights, 7582 Las Vegas Blvd. S #115-405, Las Vegas, NV 89123.  This is to establish jurisdiction, which is in the State of Nevada.  Here's the Nevada Attorney General's Consumer Protection Hotline:  (702) 486-3132.\n\n* Shadowhawk Industries' return merchandise address in California:  Shadowhawk Flashlights, 7875 Highlands Village Place, Suite B102 #401, San Diego CA  92129.  This will also establish jurisdiction in the State of California.  Here's the California State AG Consumer Protection website: [...]\n* USPS signature delivery confirmation when you send the merchandise back.  Otherwise, you have no proof that you sent it or that they received it.  And you WILL need proof.  Sorry, they won't pay return postage.\n\n* Another call to Shadowhawk once delivery has been made.  Otherwise, you probably won't see your refund in your lifetime (I'm in this phase as of this writing).\n\nWhat you will NOT receive:  A standard Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.  They'll try to pass a 'voice return authorization' off on you.  Don't fall for it; keep pressing.  Eventually, they'll tell you to use the order_id number in the URL.\n\nIf you've purchased this product and are unhappy with its quality, these are the tools you'll need.  NOT RECOMMENDED.";BAD flashlights...if not purchased through Amazon, here's what you'll need to return them...
97;129.0;3.0;6.0;449;I give this product three stars as the light is just ok at best. I gotta hand it to the people at Shadowhawk. Their advertising is top notch. I fell for it and purchased this light. I sold it on eBay at a loss. The one star reviews stem from angry buyers who felt like they where taken. Sadly, like me,they where. Live and learn and move on just a little wiser. With that said,  for the same money,get yourself a Thrunite TN4A. It runs off 4AA batteries and is a blinding 1150 lumens. Yes you read that right. Dont believe me? Go on YouTube and watch the many reviews on Thrunite products. For a little less than $300 they will sell you a flashlight that will literally light a city block and unlike the Shadowhawk X800, works as advertised.;Take your money and buy a Thrunite TN4A
98;36.0;1.0;28.0;450;These flashlights were not advertised properly. The battery on mine only lasted a week. I ordered a bunch and it took way to long to get the product.

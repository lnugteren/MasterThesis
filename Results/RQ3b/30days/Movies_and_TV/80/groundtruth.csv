0;1.0;5.0;22.0;0;"I have to say, it was amazing watching the Extend TV version for the first time since I was a very young boy! Being a huge fan of this movie, I watched the original version at least twice a year for the past several years. The extended TV version allowed me to view it with fresh eyes and experience things I had not experienced since my childhood. There were things that I remembered, but there were a number of scenes and extensions to scenes that I had completely forgotten about.\n\nThings to note about this version of the movie on Blu-Ray:\n1. The Extended TV version is NOT in 5.1 surround sound audio. It is in Stereo only! HOWEVER, the Special Edition version that is included with this collection DOES come with 5.1 surround sound audio.\n\n2. Though the Blu-Ray format is 1080HD, there are scenes that are clearly a lower resolution than others. You will notice a bit of grain with the lower resolution clips if you are watching it on an HD TV. This is a result of an Upconvert from lower res footage. It's equivalent to blowing up and image much larger than it's original size. Being in the business, I know that this is something that has been done a number of times with older movies. In some cases the conversion is not too noticeable, but in others it is, especially with older movies.\n\n3. The thing to remember about this version is, it was intentionally made longer for the purpose of making it a THREE DAY television broadcast.  For this reason, there are some scenes that will seem a bit drawn out and far longer than needed.\n\n4. This movie is for diehard Superman fans that love collecting Superman memorabilia. If you are NOT a super-fan of the original Superman movie, this may not be for you. This version is not meant to improve upon the original movie, though there are some scenes that do enhance the film. This film is meant to allow viewers to simply experience the much anticipated, 3 Day television ""Superman the Movie"" event that many of us got to enjoy many years ago!";A TRUE COLLECTORS ITEM! (Comes with TWO versions of the movie)
1;12.0;5.0;5.0;21;"FINALLY! We get the Editions on HD Blu that are meant for it and it comes out nicely done! I have been a Superman fan for quite a long time and remember this film with great fondness. I especially remember Valerie Perrine and the figure! Wow! She is a stunner here!\nThe Special Edition is quite nice to have here and with it, all the Special Features and great sound. I would say the picture quality is far better than that of the original Bluray that came out years ago. I recently watched this on the 55"" UHD 4K TV and it looks fabulous.\n\nWe also get on the 2nd Blu-ray disc the long anticipated 3 Hour long TV version. That has never been released before until now on Blu-ray.\nFor 1978, it looks pretty good. I recall seeing this back then and I have good memories of it, still.\nThank you Warner for FINALLY putting this out on HD Blu!\n\nThere are quite a few Special Features on this as well. Nicely done!";~ SUPERMAN The Movie, gets a Special Edition and Extended TV Edition finally released for HD Blu! ~
2;20.0;4.0;5.0;61;Super Greatness! First time I ever watched the 3hr version. Includes many cut scenes.

3;21.0;5.0;5.0;64;Firstly this review is for the SUPERMAN THE MOVE EXTENDED CUT BLU RAY (TV Version 188mins)/Expanded Discs, because for some reason Amazon reviews are jumbled up with other Superman The Move previous releases.\n\nAs a child I originally saw SUPERMAN in 1978 in the Theatre/Cinema and was completely blown away from start to finish! and easily became one of my favourite films of all time along side the original 1977 Star Wars film. Wasn't it brilliant back then in the 1970s of people of a certain age, boy just fantastic! Special Effects may be dated in places, but are more organic and solid, than the over the top CGI of today's age.\n\nI won't go into the storyline, but theatrical version is well paced, with drama, action and adventure through Space to Farm to City. Christopher Reeve performance as the Man of Steel/Clark Kent is the definitive in my eyes. All the nolstalgic Actors/Actresses all excell.\n\nI remember collecting the full set of Superman Trading Cards and always wonder why certain pictures did not featured in the Cinema version. It wasn't until the early 1980s I read a review in Leonard Martins Film Guide Book that he mentions there was a two night TV Version with around 40mins of deleted footage added to the then 1982 ABC TV Network in the US that featured those pictures in the Trading cards.(Back then there was no Internet! you found info in books and widely published magazines like Starburst) As far as I know the Extended Cut was shown only in the US in the early 1980s, and a even longer cut to 188mins in 1994 and subsequently in Australia and Ireland.\n\nFans out there who recorded various versions on VHS or obtained 16mm film did put together an available 188mins cut for sale or download free over the years. I managed to obtain this years ago on DVD/ VHS quality. I thought the extended cut was absolutely brilliant with the expanded scenes and deleted cuts especially when Superman flies at different angles and wonder why they were cut from the theatrical version. I can understand for time constraints and pacing that alot of scenes were not used in the cinema version and suitable for TV as to why the original Producers made the TV Versions for Viewing/Financial reasons, but I'm glad they did made these versions or we would have never seen or heard about them (General public/Fans) over the decades, until maybe the DVD/Blu ray AGE as extras!!!\n\nHistorically The original film source TV Version Cut seemed lost forever and patching up to match them from scratch I imagined would have required locating original film negatives and restoration as Richard Donnor did in his Expanded 2000 release. But out of the blue as I recently read prior to this Blu Ray release, the WIDESCREEN! full length TV VERSION was found in some Warner Archive Vault. And now we can fully enjoy the actual Extended Cut in HD Blu ray! albeit restored sound/visuals where necessary. I understand unknown to a majority of people/fans but probally die-hard fans of Superman a certain TAKE involving Lex and Ottis clammering around when the ambulance van doors are flung open seems shorter which was actually the edit used in the 1982 TV ABC version and a longer one in an international TV Broadcast. A downloaded version made by a fan called Restored International Cut included the longer one with Lex and Ottis as opposed to the original TV Broadcast in 1982 which also didn't include Christopher Reeve/Marlon Brando scene in the fortress of Solitude after Superfeats. I guess Pan & Scan and edit cut downs were used to form from the 188mins Widescreen recentley discovered were used in the original 1982 TV Network broadcast.  Interesting stuff, though I personally think this Blu ray release is as good as it gets.\n\nFor most of us the TV Extended cut is virtually new and discovered or even unheard of until now it's availability on Blu Ray Disc.\nFrom my own experience I thought I saw everyithing having been used to the Pan & Scan TV Average quality, but was blown away like being a child again by this fantastic WIDESCREEN VERSION with scenes I obviously haven't seen in my life. Overall brilliant. 3 hours or so flew by.\nThe picture quality is unique to it's own compared to the theatrical/expanded release in a positive way. I'm glad they kept the original sound, with enhanced spacial mono where dialogue music cues/special effects are clear and in my oppinon done well. The opening/end credits include true stereo that blends in well into the film.\n\nMy only quarm I have with this release is that like so many of the Superman DVD/Blu ray cover design they are too generic. They should have used the original UK 1978 UK art poster! buy hey! i'm probally being picky!\n\nNote: Though this is a WARNER ARCHIVES release only available ON DEMAND via Online/Sellers and not in shops, this is a geniune Blu ray manufactured DISC like any other commercial/chart busting film release quality disc and not a B D- R. It is also Region Free and should play on worldwide players.\n\nThankyou to you guys at Warner Bros/Archives for this TV Version on Blu Ray.\n\nA BRILLIANT MUST BUY!!!!!;Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!  Along side the original 1978 Theatrical Version
4;14.0;5.0;8.0;77;Hat's off to Warner Archive for releasing this legendary extended version of Superman the Movie. This version was a true event when it was shown over two nights on ABC in 1983. This was long before the internet or hundreds of cable channels and most people watched what was on the three main networks live. Not only was ABC showing a hugely popular movie, they were showing it with 40 minutes of never before seen footage. This was a mind blowing concept at the time. It was before the era of deleted scenes on DVD and was the first time people were introduced to the concept that scenes were actually cut out of movies.\n\nLow quality VHS copies of that ABC version and subsequent 1980s broadcasts have circulated for years among collectors. When WB video released STM in various forms over the years, fans always requested the TV version. Instead, we got the 2000 Special Edition, which restored several of the scenes, but ultimately only 8 of the 40 minutes. It also had a newly remixed soundtrack that replaced many of the familiar sound effects, which turned off many fans from that version. (to clarify, there are 3 versions of STM available: the 143 minute theatrical version, the 151 minute Expanded/Special Edition and the 188 minute Extended TV version. This blu-ray includes the 151 and 188 minute versions).\n\nNow here we are in 2017 and Warner Archive has found a holy grail widescreen 35mm print of the TV version miraculously preserved in a vault. Cropped 16mm prints of the TV version have been in the hands of collectors for years, but no one even suspected there was a widescreen 35mm version. Warner has meticulously transferred the print and done a lot of cleanup to produce a version that looks a hundred times better than the old 1983 version, plus reveals 40% more picture because it is in widescreen. It is a bit grainy in places, but that is how film prints from that era look. Many classic films are overly scrubbed of grain, which also removes some fine detail.  Considering the age of the print (35+ years) and the fact it was never meant to be seen in high definition, it looks very good and is more detailed than the special edition blu-ray in some places.\n\nThe audio is mostly in mono, because that is how TV was broadcast back then. Warner did add stereo music to the main and end titles, which leads me to the only negative aspect of this release. They used the wrong version of the main title theme, so it is jarringly and incorrectly edited. I'm sure this was done with good intentions, but they should have just left it as the original mono directly from the TV version, or lifted it from the soundtrack of the theatrical version. Still, this is a minor complaint and won't be noticed by most viewers. It doesn't detract from what is an overall outstanding release.\n\nHuge kudos to Warner Archive for releasing this and for doing a fantastic job with it. Highly recommended. I hope they release the unique TV version of Superman II next.;Warner has meticulously transferred the print and done a lot of cleanup to produce a version that looks a hundred times better than the old 1983 version
5;15.0;5.0;8.0;85;"I think the year was 1980 or '81. After completing its amazing theatrical run, Superman: The Movie finally got its world television premiere and was aired as a two night special event. Being a kid, Having seen it in theaters in late '78, I was stoked to watch it again. Spread out over that Sunday evening and then that following Monday night, more footage was presented that supposedly Warner Bros left on the editing floor yet I could've sworn those minor scenes were in the original theatrical showing. Well no matter....because after all these decades I'm so happy to now own that long extended tv cut. In 2000, we were graced to receive director Richard Donner's definitive cut of the 143 min film with eight added minutes; this new version is just over three hours long (188 min). There's more detail added, making for a stronger narrative (more to the destruction of Krypton, insight into the life of teenage Clark Kent, his adult life as Superman, Lex Luthor's criminal machinations, etc). This is the most definitive, most fleshed out version we'll ever see. Watching this longer version reminds me of how much fun I had seeing this on tv all those years ago. But no matter what version is shown, Superman still holds up as great timeless entertainment.\n\nHopefully now we can get the extended cuts to Superman II and III as well.";Superman: The Extended Cut

7;7.0;5.0;18.0;87;I just watched the 3 hour extended cut and loved it, but  I did notice one small difference, I was watching my dads VHS recording of the TV extended cut and there is a shot that is missing (It takes place when Lex is yelling at Otis in the van) In the Blu-ray we see Miss Teschmacher driving, but on my Dad's Vhs recording we see Otis hanging from the back with the door open.;Superman Extended Cut
8;19.0;5.0;6.0;87;Well, I am surprised like everybody else that Warner Brothers would go out of their way to release Superman the TV version on Blu-ray. I was delighted to see it. And it is interesting when you compare it to the special edition. I hope that they decide to do the same thing with Superman 2. Even though Superman 2 is a little more complicated since they added a flyby scene of Superman flying by a Jet liner left over from Superman the first film and scenes filmed for Superman 2 from Richard Donner inerwolven with Richard Lesters cut of the film. I have a boot leg of both Superman the TV version and Superman 2 the TV version on DVD.  The quality of the two leave a lot to be desired. So basically I am saying is that U am glad that they took the time to release the TV version of Superman on blu ray.;Superman, the TV version
9;24.0;3.0;5.0;88;"If the rumors on IMDB are to be taken as the truth, the 3-hour cut was made for the sole purpose of the producers trying to get more money from TV networks, and it sure feels like it.  There are some great extended scenes, most notably in the beginning on Krypton and being able to see more of Marlon Brando's Jor-El, but certain scenes like Lana Lang giving silent reactions in the car for an additional few minutes, or young Clark jumping on a few extra pieces of ice in the North Pole, feel completely unnecessary and only work to slow down the film's pacing.  On top of this, certain scenes just seem to linger, making them more awkward than practical.\n\nIt's great that this blu-ray exists for historical purposes, and the Special Edition gets it ""just right"" in terms of plot pacing, but after watching the 3-hour version once, there's really not a need to watch it again.  Deleted scenes exist for a reason, and the 3-hour cut makes a viewer hyper-aware as to why.";Worth watching, but brings nothing new
10;17.0;5.0;7.0;89;I waited 35 years to watch this again.\nThis is the most uncut edition you will ever find of Superman the movie.\nWith all of the footage, it fills in alot of the storyline for a greater understanding of the movie.\nA must have.\nThis should have been the original theater verison in my opinion. It never should have been cut to begin with.;The definitive edition.
11;13.0;5.0;9.0;89;Hi, like many who I am sure have to wait 2 more days for this will be pleased. I got mine today after some graveling and then sweet talk. Well worth it.\n  It looks fantastic. Seems to be a new 2K scan from a recent IP. Much like Time after Time and Goodbye Girl recent releases from Warner Archive Collection. Very well done.\n  While it's exactly The ABC Sunday Night Movie edition. It never looked this seemless and sounded like this. Future KCOP VHS copies can now be torched.\n  Notable fixed sequences are the full and corrected audio for Fatherly Advice Sequence after Supermans Air Force one rescue, also Superman's scream before turning back time\nhas been restored to original. This flaw has angered me since it's been muffled since 2001 DVD and then again with the 2011 Blu-ray. Finally Fixed. Check disc 2 to compare.\n  Hopefully Superman II gets the same treatment.\nThis copy alone has sold out twice since it's inital preorder on Amazon and WBShop in past 2 weeks. Warner Archives has already remastered Superman II ABC TV release hinging upon the success of this release.\n  Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for it. Godpeed to that. Buy this and see how happy it makes you. Let's just say it makes my decade.\n\nSonyMan......;Finally, after a week delay. A masterpiece arrives...
12;10.0;4.0;12.0;92;The television cut is great to have, not having seen it since it was on tv and I was 8. It now, though, pretty much denecessitates ( probably not a word, but it sounds right) the 2000 Expanded Edition. Everything added to that version is in the tv cut. Therefore, this would have been an excellent package had it included the theatrical cut as well or instead. Also, I had the 2006 5.1 Dolby Digital blu Ray so I was glad to finally have it in DTS HD MA sound and, now that pretty much all known footage shot for this film has been released, a pristine theatrical cut to accompany it would have been awesome. The tv cut, on the other hand looks great. Other than a couple audio glitches during the opening credits and I think one more later, the audio is the original audio sound mix which is cool. All the extra scenes are cool but they also make you appreciate Stuart Bairds editing for the theatrical cut, which definitely helps with pace. Its nice to finally have the tv cut looking and sounding great. Its a fine release.;Warner Bros. has been very good to fans of this film

15;3.0;5.0;49.0;98;"George Lucas is a convenient scapegoat for those looking to cast blame upon the current state of ""revisionist cinema.""  But, in reality, he was only giving a media obsessed culture more of what they want.  There is no ""final cut"" of a particular film anymore, only a funhouse mirror of infinitely edited variations, cut together whenever inspiration (or marketing necessity) strikes.  But Lucas is simply a high-profile target for creationist criticism; in fact, the studios have been suffering from ""special edition syndrome"" for nearly 50 years now.\n\nCase in point, the Extended Cut of Richard Donner's Superman (1978) made its television premiere with over 40-minutes of story added to stretch the debut to a two-night event.  Some bits and pieces of this expanded footage has turned up in various incarnations of the film on home video over the years, but we've never had the full 188-minute epic released on hi-def until now. Is it the final say on what many still consider to be the best superhero movie of all time...or too much of a good thing?\n\nAs you might imagine, it's a little of both.\n\nSuperman was ahead of it's time from the get-go considering Donner actually shot both the original and most of the sequel - featuring General Zod and his evil cronies - back-to-back before being replaced by Richard Lester.  And while Donner's version of Superman II eventually saw the light of day (again, thanks to fan demand), it was a compromised version of what could have been.  The new Extended Cut of the original still feels like Donner's film, just a more loose and organic version that - depending on your point of view - needs a bit of pruning.\n\nIt's difficult and tedious to point out exactly what's ""new"" here; there are plenty of fan websites for that.  Suffice to say that those additional 40-minutes are spread out amongst the entirety of the film, resulting in scene extensions and casual character asides you might not even notice.  In fact, a lot of the new footage is almost contextually invisible.  And that's a good thing!  There are very few moments that stick out as obvious add-ons, nothing that changes the mood or a motivations, no Greedo-shoots-first controversy to debate.  But it's also obvious which new scenes are unnecessary; bits needed to be cut short for reasons of narrative content not commercial necessity.  In short, Superman: The Extended Cut is the same film, only longer.  And in an era of rejiggered, reimagined and often completely reinvented restorations, that's particularly satisfying all by itself.\n\nWarner Archive's Blu-ray edition offers up all the new material in seamless high-definition; there's no noticeable change in quality from one scene to the next.  And the 2-film collection in throws in the special edition of Superman: The Movie (previously released on Blu) for comparisons sake.  All of the previous special features for that one are carried over, including Donner's commentary, three documentaries, screen tests, additional scenes and a music only track of John Williams iconic score.";Simply more Superman to love!

18;5.0;5.0;23.0;102;It's too good to be true!  Super rare TV cut here. For those wondering and as the story goes the Salkind producers put together a lengthier version for TV back in the 80's to pad time and get more money from the network. Don't confuse this with most versions that were aired on TV as this cut contained extra scenes and extensions, I think everything the producers could find really having seen a blurry cut of it myself. It only aired a few times to my knowledge and those scenes have never been restored or released officially in any format. So there was a TV cut which was always shown and this one that is the holy grail. Not saying it contains tons of scenes with Superman but true fans should have fun picking out the little moments added into the Bluray. A real gem we're getting here.;Christmas comes early!
19;2.0;5.0;60.0;103;"I have seen the 3 hour Television Cut and the tone is very different.  Now in general there isn't any real new scenes.  What we get is scene extensions.  Most of what is cut from each scene is the comedy element.  This was a wise choice..  I think some thing could have been left in but the film was over 2 hours long when it was released.  In 1978 the average length for a film was  under 2 hours.  The most exciting part of this version is the  extensions of the Krypton scenes. Now out of all the new scenes I would of kept in  1)  There is an added element of a guard going to Jor-El home to arrest him.  To say more would be wrong.  2) During the Chasing Rockets segment there is an added bit that I love where one of the rockets ""just goes around Superman"".  3) Another great moment is where Jimmy Olsen is picked up by ""Superman"" and he  photographs the Hoover Dam falling apart.  I am glad this version is being released.  Fans can finally see it.  It is also nice to see why they were cut to begin with.";Worth watching  The Best Super Hero Movie Ever Made
20;28.0;5.0;5.0;225;For me...this will always be the definitive Superman movie.  Christopher Reeve, may he rest in peace, is Superman. He'll always be Superman to several generations now and into the future.  And although some of the effects are noticeably dated, one cannot but be awed by the cinematography, especially in the early farm scenes in Smallville.  Beautifully shot with majestic landscapes, you truly have to appreciate something with such scope from a superhero film made in the 1970s.  Although the budget ballooned, you can really see the amount of love and detail put into this movie. It still holds up to the test of time.  Witty banter, excellent chemistry between Christopher, Margot and Gene.  The rockets still look believable and Lois' tragic fate still scares the crap outta me.  I simply have to give this movie a watch every year.  Nothing will ever come close to John Williams original score as well. Richard Donner's name as well as the talented crew behind this movie will always go down as being ahead of their time.  Simply incredible.;The Definitive Superman.
21;33.0;5.0;5.0;578;I'm so grateful to Christopher Reeve for playing his role with seriousness and integrity instead of making fun of it.

Back in the late 70's, while walking East on 42nd\nStreet on my way home after work, there was a huge crowd milling between 2nd and 3rd Ave.  Everybody was looking up and\nshouting, and there, on top of the Daily News Building, all brilliantly lit up, was a helicopter perched precariously on the edge of the roof!  It was very frightening!  I never heard another thing about the event.  And then, the next year, the movie, Superman came out,\nand there it was!;The Daily Planet building
22;41.0;4.0;6.0;1209;"I still have yet to get through all the extras but had to watch the extended version which includes a nice moment between Kal-el and his father following the first apperance of Superman. I love the selection of bonus footage including the audtion tapes for Lois Lane. It will be obvious to one and all the Margot Kidder was the right choice. I would like to know who else was up for any of the other parts. I cannot imagine a better Lex Luthor than Gene Hacknman (even if he is as threatening as Pee Wee Herman) but this was never intended (at least I believe) to be seen as a ""real"" world. We can sort of chuckle now at some of the corny lines Christopher Reeves delivers but he seemed truer to the comic book Superman than this modern re-imaginings where the fun of the character has been systematically squeezed out. Superman is a square and should remain that way. I guess he might be considered the straight man in this universe. I have yet to get to the George Reeve Superman meets the Mole Men. It is very short and runs just under a hour. I thought it was a feature length film released in theaters but it was probably bulked up by cartoons, news reel footage, etc. I have already seen a few of the magnificent Max Fleisher Superman carttons. The storys are silly but the animation (even though it is done by roto-scoping) is pretty spectacular.

I remember when I first saw this roughly 35 years ago in a giant screen theater in Portland.  I was agog, it was so well done.  I was digesting the impact of this movie for a couple days.

While truthfully only the first two movies are good, he remained that icon for quite sometime. There are things about this movie that have become dated and maybe even a little campy, but when it comes to a character like Superman there are always those risks. This is the first Superman movie I ever saw, and though it was before my time, it was the Superman I identified with. Needless to say this movie and this role immortalized Chris Reeve and forever made him a legend.;The Man, The Legend, The Icon
25;48.0;5.0;7.0;2153;"I know my review's title is rather bold and might be subject to debate. However, I can't see how.\n\nSure, these kinds of movies are made nowadays with such huge budgets and more eye dazzling special effects....but they all lack the sincerity and wonder of Richard Donner's 1978 masterpiece.\n\nLet's face it. Donner approached this film with almost a religious reverence. In his own words, Superman is ""Americana"". He could easily have done this in a campy fashion with a tongue rooted firmly in cheek, as was the Batman series a decade earlier. Instead, he decided to make it epic in scope and a sincere tribute to the archetype of super powered heroes. Given the time this film was made and released (the turbulent 70s), it could have lent itself to being ""hokey"" or ""sappy""...but it wasn't. It was a breath of fresh air and, like Star Wars the previous year, was a milestone in cinematic special effects. Sure, you could look at it now and say ""so what"", but back in 1978, I could have SWORN Chris Reeve was flying. In my mind, it still looks ten times better than the CGI drivel that pollutes the genre now.\n\nChristopher Reeve is the only person who could have done this role justice. I can't imagine another actor doing a better job. They tried with a Reeve clone in the abysmal Superman Returns (although...I will say Routh was the best thing about that movie). Cavill looks good in recent pics I've seen....but I am reserving judgment until the Snyder film comes out next year.\n\nFrom the grandeur of the opening credits (still gives me shivers every time I watch) to the final pass over Earth as the sun rises and Reeve smiles at the audience, as if to be winking to the viewer and saying ""try not to enjoy yourself...I DARE you""....It is the epitome of what this kind of film should be. Superhero flicks are so cookie cutter in 2012 that the studios crank at least a dozen or more of them every year. When this was released, it was the first of it's kind and truly an event.\n\nI will swear to my dying day....there hasn't been a film based on a comic book character since that could touch this one. It's the standard by which I judge superhero films on...and it still hasn't been matched. Nolan's Batman films came close...but they lacked the wonder and grandeur because he spent too much time trying to base everything in REALITY.\n\nThere's too much reality to deal with every day....Superman takes me away and I am flying right there with him. 34 years later....I'm still enjoying the flight.\n\nThanks Mr. Donner....and rest well Mr. Reeve. My childhood owes a debt I could never repay.";"Best ""superhero"" film of all time"
26;42.0;1.0;9.0;3019;I am simply astounded by the popularity of this terrible film. One would imagine that one of the most popular superhero films ever made would at least be entertaining in a base kind of way, but this film fails in nearly every way. The script is the worst I have ever seen. The Superman universe's fictional laws are constantly contradicted and broken when it fits the director's whim.\n\nThe dialogue and acting are atrocious. All of the actors (and it stars people like Reeves and Hackman, who are both very good actors) portray their roles with a kind of smirky self-consciousness, as if to underscore the ridiculousness of the production. The dialogue is an endless stream of boorish cliches, from start to finish. This particular quality (the low quality of the dialogue) is overpowering in two sequences: the opening scene on Krypton, and the the bit which was probably intended as romantic where Superman and Lois Lane go flying around the city. The latter is worse. Lane's voiceover seems like a distillation of the worst elements of dialogue in Harlequin romances, purified to their rotten, insipid core. Dialogue this bad shouldn't exist.\n\nThe film is unaware of whether it wants to be good campy fun or a serious work of cinema. It tries to be both, and fails to be either. The campy plot, dialogue, and acting serve to undermine the seriousness inherent in several of the film's attempts at poignancy. And, likewise, the seriousness undermines the film's campiness.\n\nThis is the worst kind of film: that which requires its characters to act stupid or incomprehensible in order to drive the drama. It goes all out. Characters act randomly, with no explanation as to why they are doing what they are doing.. Villains talk about how Superman cannot be harmed by bullets or fire... and then proceed to attack him with bullets and fire. Luthor (who boasts about having an IQ of 200) describes his plot in great detail to Superman, and then leaves him in the same room as a woman who has just expressed horror at his (Luthor's) plans. Clark Kent states that he must leave the home of his mother, without ever expressing why he must to the audience: we (and his mother, evidently) are expected to infer this information.\n\nWhat makes this film so offensive, however, isn't the poor acting, dialogue, characters, or plot (this is, after all, a SUPERMAN movie - you can only go so far with the material), but the fact that the script disregards basic rules of narrative construction, contradicting logic and this world's fictional rules when it sees fit to do so. At one moment, Superman must change in a phone booth in order to rescue Lois Lane. During another, he can magically change what he is wearing in order to address a threat by Luthor. Moreover, Superman can not only reverse time by spinning the Earth backward on its axis (a dubious notion to begin with), but can select which aspects of the past he'd like to change.\n\nThis film was primarily a spectacle of Special Effects when it was released. It has suffered the fate all such films must: its techniques are now exceedingly phony looking, and when the graphical prettiness is no longer an element, the film collapses.\n\nI am neither given to misanthropy nor to elitism, but I must question the collective sanity of the people of this world when such a lazy film as this is so widely loved to this day.;Awful, hackneyed, insulting to its audience
27;22.0;5.0;35.0;3149;"The movie:\n\n""You'll believe a man can fly."" That was the advertising tagline. Well, I can't think of many instances of it, but this was one time when a movie delivered on its hype. ""Superman"" fires on many cylinders, but the main one, the integral one, was believability. This film is an absolute achievement in terms of tone, style, and effects. For 1978, the effects are terrific, but also the performances and the writing really gel and sell the concept to the audience.\n\nWe haven't seen yet the actor who can top Christopher Reeve's Superman. The solidness, the goodness radiating from his presence in costume, combined with the vulnerability and sheer hilarity of his Clark Kent are (perhaps) impossible to top. Margot Kidder turns in a feisty Lois Lane, and their chemistry is great. Gene Hackman is a credible Lex Luthor, both funny and menacing at the same time. Supporting players fill out a cast that just really inhabits the world and never feels less than real.\n\nThe run time of the movie is perhaps a bit flabby, and this edition adds about 3 minute of new material. But I for one am quick to forgive it - it just so captures a feeling of innocence, wonder, Americana, that I'm willing to just bask in it, even when the action slows down.\n\nThe Blu-Ray:\n\nWell, this is not one of the discs you'll pop in to show off ""how great HD looks."" The film was shot almost throughout with soft focus filters which bump up the haze of lighting and obscure detail.\n\nBUT: It looks as good as it probably ever can and ever will. In A-B comparisons with the previous DVD (which was great for its day) the upgrade is subtle but evident. Some shots show very strong detail, when it's in focus. Check out the foliage in Lois' rooftop apartment. Some facial shots show exceptional detail in fine lines. Whenever the soft filter is absent, you can really tell you're watching an HD presentation. The colors are the main upgrade in the Blu-Ray - reds and blues really pop, and black levels are rock solid in most shots not involving visual effects. Film grain is present and generally not too obtrusive, except during some effects shots. But I prefer its presence to excessive digital noise reduction. In the end, how you feel about this Blu-Ray will depend on your emotions for the film itself (mine are very strongly positive), and how you feel about a home video accurately replicating the look and feel of the original presentation's film stock (something I'm also strongly in favor of).\n\nAudio is presented in a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix. There isn't much of a workout for the surrounds, but John Williams' iconic score really sings, nonetheless.\n\nExtras include an hour's worth of documentaries, reprises from the DVD edition. Casting tests, trailers, a commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, and a wonderful score only track highlighting the music, round out the disc. Overall, at least average and probably slightly above average.\n\n**********\n\nI grew up with this film. I'm predisposed to enjoying it. As a Blu-Ray, it is hampered by the stylistic choices of the filmmakers, but still gives us a very good presentation of the film.\n\nIt's a five star film in my book. It's certainly in the top 5 comic book movies ever made (and was the true pioneer in terms of big budget successes from comic book material.) I considered downgrading this disc by one star simply because it can't overcome the flaws inherent to the source material. For the paltry sum Amazon is asking for it, you really can't go wrong, though. Kids of all ages (ages 3 to 83?) who just want to feel good about the world will be transported to a better, simpler, more beautiful place. Fans of 1970's cinema will find a lot to love, as well. There are many shots which really shine in detail, and almost all of the shots benefit from zippier colors. If you don't own this film otherwise, or are just a fan of the action/comic book genre, this is a must-buy. It's a classic.";Great superhero flick looks as good as it likely can on Blu-Ray
28;31.0;4.0;12.0;3205;"I was lucky enough to have seen Superman in the theatres when I was a child back in the 70s, and the sense of wonder it evoked in me then is renewed every time I watch it as an adult. Its epic grandeur, its sense of gravitas, has never been equaled by any other superhero movie (I mean, Marlon Brando, Glenn Ford, Trevor Howard, Gene Hackman, Mario Puzo, all screen legends of the time for a film based on comics? What were they thinking!). Christopher Reeve is the quintessential Superman, incredibly handsome, incredibly wholesome and good-natured, and his heroism on screen is all the more poignant in the light of what happened to him in real life. I still think that the CAN YOU READ MY MIND night-flying sequence is among the most romantic scenes in all cinema. This blu-ray version is beautiful. If you're looking for the sharpness of IRONMAN or BATMAN BEGINS on blu-ray, you will be disappointed. Much of the film is shot in a soft-glow style, and this look has been preserved in the blu-ray transfer. The Krypton sequences seem to take place behind a veil of haze, which might be frustrating for those of us used to the crystal-clear images of hi-def. But the Smallville sequences are  beautifully awash in golden sunlight and lush colours and the sharp outlines of prairie houses. They could have made the whole film sharper and clearer in the transfer, but this would have altered the sweeping, romantic, film-like feel of the cinematography. What you get here is better colour saturation. It's a pity that the studio did not offer the latest Dolby True-HD or DTS-HD Master Audio sound format; but the Dolby 5.1 sound here  still soars (John William's magnificent score is itself worth the price of admission). Compared to the earlier DVD edition, the channel separation in this blu-ray is more pronounced; towards the end when Jor-El warns Superman against tampering with history, check out how impressively his disembodied voice scans across all 5 speakers.  If you never had the chance to catch Superman in the theatres--or if you simply want to relive that experience-- the next best thing is to get this blu-ray and watch it in a darkened room at home on a large projector screen with surround speakers.

35;32.0;2.0;13.0;3864;"Be warned, Jor-el -- I am a ""Superman: The Movie"" purest to the Nth degree (I saw the original in its first theatrical run three times in 1978 and many, many more times on videotape).\n\nNOTE: If you thought ""Superman Returns"" was a better film than ""The Movie"", you may as well stop reading this review right here and now. There isn't a presence on earth that could convince me of that; and frankly, you don't know what you're talking about.\n\nThe so-called ""Original Theatrical Release"" featured in the new 4-disc ""The Movie"" set may have cut out all those unnecessary ""director's cut"" scenes (present in 2000's 4-disc all-movies DVD set) -- for example, 1) an elongated council meeting between Jor-el and the scientists who don't believe his ""outlandish"" theory that Krypton will soon be destroyed and 2) after Superman's initial set of rescue sequences (starting off with the Lois Lane helicopter grab), he has an extraneous, melodramatic consultation with Jor-el in the Fortress of Solitude (with the exact same musical score from an earlier scene where Jor-el bids farewell to his infant son on Krypton; a technique which I despise, as if there wasn't enough dramatic music stock from John Williams' incredible score).\n\nBUT... what the creators of this new DVD set didn't do was purge the HORRIBLE trumped-up ""enhanced"" sound effects from the 2000 DVD release (yes, I looked for a way to turn it off in some sort of audio feature, but you can't). And it's obvious almost immediately. A little background before my explanation: I regard the opening credit sequence of ""The Movie"" as one of the most heart-pulsatingly effective credit sequences I've ever seen (and heard) on film -- from that exquisite trumpet solo as Superman makes his first appearance in comic form (Action Comics) being read by a child, to the first-person ""flight"" over The Daily Planet globe, and on thru the bright-blue ""whooshing"" trails of the transparent credits as we travel to Krypton aided by Williams' never-to-be-matched march (simply amazing!). My problem with the ""enhanced"" sound effects -- and where I knew they STILL hadn't given me the ORIGINAL original theatrical release as advertised -- was in the ""whooshing"" credits sound from ""ALEXANDER SALKIND PRESENTS"" onward that all but drowns out Williams' exceptional score (where the original whooshes complemented the score). And much worse, we're not given that EXPLOSIVE WHOOSH sound at the first appearance of the Superman red-and-yellow shield -- now (as was in 2000) replaced by an over-whooshy (pardon my terms) sound with a clank at the end (the rest are over-whooshy sans clanks). And what about that ""nails on chalkboard"" crystal squeal after Krypton and its red sun have blown to smithereens or when young Clark first builds the Fortress? It's almost too much to bear (it actually hurts my ears now).\n\nBut this was all part of the 2000 sound effect enhancements; if you don't believe me (and you have a copy of it), compare the ""whooshing"" sound effects from either this DVD or the 2000 DVD (exact same enhanced sound effects I've noted in both) with the videotape version (you can still find it in some video stores).\n\nAnd speaking of ears, I couldn't believe them in 2000, and now I'm just pissed off about it in 2007. Will I return the DVD because of this ""oversight""? Most likely. Will I send a complaint to Warner Bros.? It's on its way. Am I alone in my disgust? Highly doubt it (and I'd sure better NOT be).\n\nThe extras are nice (the ony reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1), but so what?

The upgrade to this four-disc collection simply isn't worth it in my opinion, unless you're a die-hard Superman fan.\n\nThis is what the four-disc collection includes.  On Disc 1 is the theaterical version the movie with a feature-length commentary by the producers, Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spemgler.  Disc-2 has the expanded version (though techincally correct, I don't really consider an extra eight mintues to the film to be an expanded version) with a feature-length commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankievicz.  This is also on the 2001 DVD.  On Disc-3 are the three documentaries that can also be found on the 2001 DVD, each one running about thirty minutes in length--Taking Flight: The Development of Superman, Making Superman: Filming the Legend, and The Magic Behind the Cape.  There's also a look at some deleted and restored scenes.  Finally, on Disc-4 is a fifty-minute 1980 TV documentary on The Making of Superman: The Movie.  A lot of this is already included in the three documentaries on Disc-3.  There's also the fifty-minute 1951 movie, Superman and the Mole Men, starring George Reeves and Phyllis Coats, plus nine Superman cartoons from the 1940's.\n\nI hadn't seen Superman: The Movie since it originally came out in 1978, and I was surprised at how well it held up.  I watched the expanded edition, instead of the theatrical version.  I have to admit, however, that I enjoyed the first half of the film more than I did the second.  The first half was much more serious in tone, while the second half was striving to be campy and joke-filled.  There were also a couple of plots holes in the second half of the movie that the viewer just has to overlook.  An example is that if Superman can fly fast enough to turn the earth's orbit backwards in time, why couldn't he get to Lois Lane's sinking car fast enough to save her?  Anyway, because it had been so long since I'd seen the movie, I didn't really notice anything different with the expanded edition.  Nothing stood out for me, which is why I don't think eight minutes amounts to much, though it is better than the minute-and-a-half that Donner added to Lethal Weapon 3 for the Director's Cut.\n\nI did enjoy the documentaries on Disc-3.  It was fun seeing just how skinny Christopher Reeve was when he auditioned for the role.  Also, I didn't know that Richard Donner had been fired from Superman II, though he already had 50-to-70% of the movie in the can.  He was actually doing Part I and II at the same time.  It was interesting to hear how Warner Brothers didn't want anything to do with the movie at first, but then began to cought up money once they finally realized just how good the film was going to be.  And, before Richard Donner was brought in to direct the film, the producers had hired Guy Hamilton to do it.  Hamilton was the director of Goldfinger.  It was only because the shooting location of the film was eventually changed from Italy to England that Hamilton was dropped (he hadn't paid his taxes in England) and Donner was brought on board.  Hamilton had already been involved in a year of pre-production with the film, but Donner couldn't use any of it and had to start over from scratch.  Donner was under a tremendous amount of pressure by everyone (for example, the producers had Richard Lester ready to step in at any moment as the director), yet he managed to get the movie made.  It turned out to be one Warner Brother's biggest hits.  Donner's reward was to be fired from Superman II.  Hollywood!\n\nDisc-4 didn't do that much for me.  As I said, parts of the 1980 documentary had been included in the three 2001 documentaries on Disc-3.  I did watch the short movie, Superman and the Mole Men, which was pretty funny.  The Mole Men were played by little people with rubber bald caps on and a black jump suits.  I found myself laughing out loud when Lois Lane first sees them and freezes in absolute fear.  The expression on her face is priceless.  Then, a mother in the near-by town sees them and screams so loud that people several blocks away can hear her as if she's standing right next to them.  Man, that was one loud scream!  I will say that George Reeves was a much better actor than people gave him credit for.  I felt he was smart to play Clark Kent as a straight, hard-hitting reporter, rather than as a bumbling, navie innocent the way Christopher Reeve did.  As far as the cartoons go, I didn't watch any of them.  Wasn't interested.\n\nIf I had it to do over again, I'd pick up the 2001 DVD edition of the expanded film and save fifteen dollars.  Last, but not least, for any of you interested in Superman II, there are now two versions of it out, so be careful in buying.  One is the Richard Lester version, which I got by mistake, and the other is the complete Richard Donner edition.  I barely made it through the Richard Lester version.  Though Sarah Douglas is sexy in it as Ursa, the film just doesn't hold up for me and seems too silly.;The four stars are for the movie, not the extras!

In fact, Christopher Nolan (director of Batman Begins) frequently credits Superman with how to do comic book films correctly.  He wanted his own film to be on that level.\n\n I was seven-years-old when I went and watched the movie.  As a young kid, I was a huge fan of the old Adventures of Superman, and ignorantly, that's what I thought I was going to see: a movie with all the characters from the television show.  I still recall walking out of the theater absolutely dumbfounded by such a fantastic film that made Superman come alive.  It was the flying scenes that captivated me.  It looked so real to me, especially compared to the dated effects of the television show.\n\nThankfully, an unknown actor, Christopher Reeve, was chosen to play the part.  In the extra features Richard Donner cites that Reeve immersed himself in the part and even made his body move in such a way that you felt he was flying, even though he was strapped into a harness.\n\nAs I've stated in my Smallville reviews, the thing that makes Superman so compelling is that Clark Kent is his disguise, and Superman is who he really is.  Most heroes have it the other way around.  Reeve also recognized that to pull off a realistic disguise, he'd have to act much differently as Clark Kent.  Crediting Cary Grant as the man he borrowed his ""nerdy"" persona, Reeve successfully creates two separate identities.  It's believable that nobody would ever suspect the nerdy, bumbling, and clumsy Clark Kent was being the Man of Steel.\n\nOther performances in this film are very good.  Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor, even though he decided to give Luthor a decidedly humorous spin.  I still like Michael Rosenbaum's depiction the best from Smallville, but these are two different eras.  Ned Beatty is hilarious as Luthor's bumbling henchman, Otis.\n\nIt's also great to see Jackie Cooper after all of these years (from the Our Gang) to take on the role of Perry White.  He's great in the role as well, giving White a fiesty side.\n\nMargot Kidder also does a good job as Lois Lane.  I had to admit that she was a pleasant surprise.  Considering the women she beat out for the role such as Lesly Ann-Warren and Cindy Williams, it speaks highly to her interpretation of the character.\n\nIt's nearly an hour before Superman finally shows up, but when he does, it's a scene that even by today's standards still takes your breath away as he flies up to catch the falling Lois Lane with one hand and then catching the helicopter in the other.\n\nYou simply can't mention the greatness of this film without talking about the timeless music of John Williams.  The opening credits that start with one of Williams' signature pieces simply speaks to the power and grandeur of this cinematic masterpiece.  Donner still recalls vividly of being literally speechless and feeling the hairs on his body stand up when he first heard John Williams' rendition.\n\nIf you're going to do a comic book movie, you have to know the character.  Unfortunately, most people who attempt to do comic book films don't know the character, and the characters are only shadows of who they truly are.  The first four Batman films are a testament to this.  Sam Raimi is an avid Spider-Man reader, and Christopher Nolan has also been a Batman reader for quite some time.  Richard Donner also immersed himself in the world of Superman to make sure that he made a film that stayed true to the character.\n\nSuperman is the hero that all other heroes are compared to.  There is no other hero who retains such a mystique and grandeur of goodness and justice.  Unlike Batman who is driven by vengeance or even Spider-Man who is driven by guilt and responibility, Superman is driven by a sense of trying to make the world as a whole a better place.\n\nSuperman transcends the comic book world to be an American hero as well, as he embodies all the things that we, as Americans, hold nearest and dearest to ourselves.  This film gives us that Superman.";Set the Standard for all Comic Book Films to Follow
42;26.0;4.0;22.0;4081;I watched the HD version of Superman TMP today.  PQ is very good for a film from this time period.

The real kicker was when he reversed time by spinning the earth backwards.. Oh god... If you finished high school, then this movie isn't for you.\n\nUpdate:\nOkay maybe I was a little bit rough with this review (especially my last few sentences). I apologize for any offense.\n\nI think I'll just sum up what I meant to communicate back in 2006: The plot isn't very believable and the solutions to the problems posed in the movie don't even have a scintilla of sense even, in my opinion, for a superhero movie. Now it isn't very believable that getting bitten by a spider will give you spider powers or that a engineering genius can build an ""iron"" suit in his basement but at least the solutions they present to overcome the villains have a foundation in reality with a lot of creative imagination involved. Unfortunately for this movie... turning back time by doing.... *sigh\n\nSo if you really enjoy Superman and really enjoyed this movie back in the 70's then you probably will like this DVD. However if you are much younger, like me, and have gotten used to more ""modern"" superhero movies then I don't think you will like this movie.";Probably good back in the 70s, terrible today
45;35.0;5.0;13.0;4203;"I was born in 1976, so I spent most of my developmental years in the wonderful 80's.  Although I was still a bit young when ""Superman-The Movie"" hit the big screen, I caught up with him through VHS and television.  Plenty have donned the red cape, from George Reeves to Dean Cain and everyone in between.  Brandon Routh, who I have yet to see in the latest film, is the current hero of the day.  Christopher Reeve was, is, and always will be Superman to me.  I don't care how hokey the special effects look in this particular flick or how bad the third and fourth films were, Reeve is the Man of Steel in my opinion.\n\nThis film gives us the origination story of Kal-El, son of Jor-El, of the planet known as Krypton.  If you've been around for a few years, you probably know the rest of the story, so I'll skip that and just stick with the performances of the actors and actresses.  I've gloated on Reeve enough, but I have to admit that his bungling, country-tinged Clark Kent is perfect.  He does a complete 180 degree turn when he rips open his business suit and that ""S"" bursts onto the scene.  Lois Lane is done with sassy flair by the great Margot Kidder.  She, much like Reeve, has become her character in my mind.  Gene Hackman hams it up as Superman's arch enemy, Lex Luthor.  His over-the-top performance is fun to watch on the screen.  Ned Beatty portrays the bumbling sidekick, Otis, and Valerie Perrine is a scene stealer as the luscious Eve.  Marlon Brando is sufficient as Kent's father, but his performance comes across as rather wooden.  Terence Stamp (General Zod), Jack O'Halloran (Non), and Maria Schell (Vond-Ah) have sinister small roles in this feature, but set the stage well for ""Superman II.""  The rest of the cast, primarily reduced to supporting roles, do a wonderful job with what they have to work with.\n\nAs stated before, the special effects are pretty hokey by today's standards, but they were top-notch in 1978.  They help move the story along at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen.\n\nThis film set a high standard for future comic book-based films.  While many have met, and in some cases surpassed, this standard, ""Superman"" will always be considered the first of the great modern comic flicks.\n\nHighly recommended to any fan of comic flicks, or anyone who just wants to relive the excitement of seeing ol' Superman fly for the first time!";The Superman For My Generation

The proof is in their careers - both actors gave their best performances in this movie, while they were yet still unpolished performers.  Gene Hackman was great with a superb dry wit and great sense of timing.\n\nThere are plenty of places to get a review of the plot so I'll skip it, but the sense of hope Superman brings to this film is great. He is America's Moses.  While the special effects don't quite make you belive a man can fly, you will get lost in the adventure and maybe be a better person for it.";Plot Driven with Wit and Wisdom
47;64.0;4.0;6.0;4207;The original Superman:The Movie I give 5 Stars: without a doubt a monumental movie.  This version, while technically great, cuts in too many (wisely cut in the first place) extra scenes and extended versions of existing scenes placing a drag on the pacing.  The original theatrical cut is considered by Richard Donner to be his 'director's cut': this version is more of a curiosity piece.  Film students could watch it to learn something about film editing and pacing.  I saw the original movie at least 15 - 20 time during it's theatrical release and feel Warner's has almost ruined the film with this presentation.  Let's hope Warner's releases the theatrical cut on the upcoming (fall 2006) Ultimate Superman collection.  One thing I will say I did like was the audio remix for Dolby 5.1.  Although I'm a purist concerning this film, they did a great job remixing the dialogue, sound effects and music.;Theatrical Cut Please
48;50.0;5.0;9.0;4215;"In my anxiety to see Superman Returns, I've been passing time by watching again every Superman movie and television series (live action and animated) that I can get my hands on. I went through the George Reeves series, the Lois & Clark and Superboy/Smallsville series and the cartoon Superman, Justice League and, God help me, even the 70's Superfriends shows. But I've saved for last the piece-de-resistance: the Christopher Reeve classics.\n\nI've genuinely forgotten how great and sweet the 1978 Superman film was, and is. A feeling of enchantment is launched in the air as ""June 1938"" flashes on the screen, then a boy leafs thru the pages of Action comics, the young lad's voiceover commenting on the Depression and the importance of truth-dealing newspapers such as the Daily Planet in so turbulent and troubled an era. Then, the immortal John Williams-crafted Superman theme song is heard and the adventure begins. True, I've always had to grind my teeth and wait out the sterile 25 minute opening. But once the film focuses on Planet Earth and the arrival of baby Kal-El, it's all so good. The segment of Clark's child- and teenhood is depicted in an almost pastoral manner, giving heft to scenes of Clark learning how truly special he is, and how he is ultimately alone. These bittersweet moments of lessons learned will shape the man that Clark will become. Then, the tragedy of his adopted father's death, leading eventually to Clark's discovery of the Fortress of Solitude and thus, his Kryptonian heritage. There is almost a sense of intermission at this point, wherein the viewer can take a breath, relax and prepare for the second half of the film. I think I'll start a new paragraph.\n\nTwelve years pass. Clark, now in his Superman guise, flies away from the Fortress of Solitude. The camera cuts next to a cabbie telling his passenger that he's arrived at the Daily Planet, and Clark Kent's new chapter begins. There, he meets Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Editor-in-Chief Perry White. Clark doesn't waste time setting up his bespectacled persona  of cluelessness and clumsiness in several nicely-paced sequences that had moments of sheer hilarity and screwballness. Next, Superman's nemesis shows up, the fiendishly clever and criminal Lex Luthor and things begin to get somewhat serious, though Luthor's wacky sidekicks intermittently interject an element of humor. Luthor's plan is diabolical and ably challenges Superman's abilities. But, in the end, all is well as the Man of Steel foils Luthor's scheme and sends him packing to the hoosegow; Superman has a fleeting romantic moment with Lois. End of film.\n\nChristopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Despite the all-star cast, Christopher Reeve makes the movie. He inhabits Superman as if he were his favorite pajamas, instilling in his iconic superhero that perfect blend of confidence, steely resolve and gentlemanly decorum. On the other hand, he infuses his Clark Kent with the proper amount of  ""aw, shucks"" country bumpkin and slouching mild mannerisms. A perfect portrayal. Christopher Reeve was born to be Superman. The reaction of the crowd upon Supe's first public appearance is still thrilling to witness. Lois Lane's freaked-out ""You've got me?! But, who's got you?"" is still a classic line. Margot Kidder is delicious as reporter Lois Lane:  nosy, plucky and in-your-face. She melts perfectly for Superman and routinely snubs Clark Kent. Go check out the screen test in the special features to see how much better Margot is, compared to the other actresses that went for the role. Gene Hackman plays Luthor more comically than I would've expected but, what the hell, it works. The best I can say of Marlon Brando as Jor-El is that his distinctive voice is used in the trailer of Superman Returns.\n\nThe special effects, for their time, are wonderfully innovative and wow-inducing. The only effect that doesn't look convincing is the sequence where teenage Clark outruns a train. Everything else, perfection.\n\nThe special features are pretty sweet: Side A contains an insightful commentary by director Richard Donner; 10 added scenes including a young Lois with her parents on a train and a scene with Jor-El and Superman; some ""Superman - The Legacy"" fun facts; and a theatrical trailer.\n\nSide B contains: three documentaries (""Taking Flight: the Development of Superman"", ""Making Superman: Filming the Legend"" and ""The Magic Behind the Cape""); deleted scenes; screen tests of Superman (Reeve with sweaty pits!), Lois Lane (with actresses Anne Archer, Lesley Ann Warren, Margot Kidder and Stockard Channing) and Ursa, the Kryptonian supervillainess in the sequel; a teaser trailer; and a TV spot.\n\nThis is a classic film, full of matinee fun and movie magic. It certainly has stood the test of time. Despite the fact that I can't wait to see Superman Returns, I doubt it could live up to Superman 1 or 2. Speaking of which, I think I'll pop in the sequel now.";still up, up and away the best Superman film

50;51.0;5.0;9.0;4280;"Although the majority of fans seem to prefer the sequel this origin movie is still a very entertaining cinematic excursion that had movie audiences lining around the block in 1978, only one year after the STAR WARS phenomenon had redefined the term blockbuster and transformed the movie landscape. In fact it holds up so well, even today, that the upcoming SUPERMAN RETURNS is supposably a part of this franchise, occurring six years after the events of SUPERMAN II and even features Marlon Brando in the theatrical trailer as the voice of Jor-El.\nWith a $55 million budget (which was enormous for its time) this movie eventually raked in almost $300 million world-wide (which even today stands as a quite respectable take.) In addition it featured a knock-out punch by John Williams who went from scoring JAWS to scoring STAR WARS and then onto SUPERMAN (amazing.)\nRemastered for its 2001 DVD release this movie is a vast improvement on a master print that had deteriorated to such an extent that some sequences were close to unwatchable. This print is clearer and sharper and corrects some previous color balancing problems. It also has a remastered soundtrack that means it sounds the best it has ever since its original 1978 release.\nAs an added bonus it also features about eight minutes of additional footage that effectively doubles Marlon Brando's screen time with new scenes on Krypton and at the Fortress of Solitude. In addition there's more early Clark Kent and disaster footage. Finally rounding out the new scenes is the reinstated Lex Luthor ""Gauntlet of Death"" sequence which had previously been seen on network television broadcasts. In stark contrast to the ire that added scenes to the STAR WARS movies has drawn from fans, fans of this series seemed largely welcome to the additions here.\nWhere this DVD really shines however is in the special features, which are impressive. First up is a scene specific commentary by Director Richard Donner and scribe Tom Mankiewicz. After writing the first three James Bond movies of the 1970s Mankiewicz was brought onto SUPERMAN to help with the script, however due to certain legal complications he could nopt be credited for the work he did and so was handed the title of Creative Consultant. This is the kind of commentary that I love, it's screen specific and its light and friendly. It's like having Donner and Mankiewicz hanging out in your living room watching this beloved movie of your childhood with you. They share a number of memories on making the movie and its good to see Mankiewicz get his proper recognition.\nThere's also an isolated score audio track that allows the viewer to marvel at the work of Williams.\nBut there's more. The jewel in the crown special feature is the three documentaries that actually act more as three chapters in one larger feature-length documentary. Before the Indiana Jones trilogy came out with its three-hour behind the scenes feature and before the three-hour ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary for the STAR WARS trilogy DVD release, we have the behind-the-scenes documentaries here that presented the benchmark by which all future DVD releases were judged.\nHosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) they feature on-camera interviews with Donner, (the late) Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman and Mankiewicz (among others.) They cover such issues as the making of the film, the failed attempts at making a man fly and the unceremonious firing of Donner who had delivered the producers a smash hit and was already over halfway through the shooting of the sequel. Still, Donner had the last laugh when several years later he got to direct all four movies of the phenomenally successful LETHAL WEAPON movies.\nMore a curiosity as anything else is a separate feature on the Superman, Lois Lane, & Ursa screen tests that include five different actresses vying for the part of Lois Lane.\nThe younger audiences that have grown up watching SMALLVILLE on the WB will no doubt be a little confused by this movie that follows a more conventional storyline than the popular Tom Welling series. I'm probably in the minority when it comes to preferring the incredible Erica Durance as Lois Lane, but Margot Kidder does an admirable job here and Gene Hackman is an interesting choice as Lex Luthor.\nHowever, where there is no debate is Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time of casting this movie Reeve embodies the part of Clark Kent and was elevated to even more mythic proportions by the courage with which he tackled his unfortunate accident.\nStarting with the death of Krypton and ending with Superman saving California, this movie (and its sequel) set a good foundation for SUPERMAN RETURNS and this DVD should find a place of honor on the shelf of every self-respecting DVD collector.";Masterpiece defines a piece of American culture for a generation
51;54.0;4.0;8.0;4312;I saw this fim as a kid many years ago and liked it a lot.  Sometimes, those childhood favorites end up being rather lame films when you watch them as adults.  This is NOT the case with Superman.  I enjoyed this film from start to finish and it brought back all of the good memories I had of it.  Each character was played almost perfectly... Lex Luthor, Lois, Ms. Tessmocher, Superman himself, etc, etc.  The solid cast really helped this movie stand out.  The music is great as well which may not seem important in a movie but I believe it is.\n\nThe Special edition of the DVD is an excellent transfer with some very cool added scenes that I feel adds to the movie in a very positive way and helped to fill in the story.\n\nOf all the Super-hero movies this is the only one that really came out this well as most of them are horribly dorky.  I have watched and will continue to watch this film and of course Part II many times and will enjoy it each and every time.  It's also nice to be able to play it for newer generations as they appear to really like it too.\n\nWhy not 5 stars then?  Well, I would have gone 4.5 if it was an option but I rarely give any movie 5 stars.  The only issue with this film is that the special effects are generally a little weak and do look pretty dated.  I understand that it as made a while ago but I feel that they could have tried a little harder with some of the special effects, especially the flying sequences.  Still, it's just nitpicking and overall it does look pretty good and is convincing enough.\n\nGo ahead and buy this version of the DVD with confidence, it's a great transfer with good sound and the extra footage is a nice bonus.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!;A Classic film and a great DVD transfer to boot!
52;71.0;4.0;5.0;4385;"Watching 1978's SUPERMAN again after all these years, I'm picking up on symbolism I missed when I saw the film as a kid.  Superman is sent to earth by a white-haired, white-dressed glowing Marlon Brando.  He grows up in humble surroundings.  At 18, he leaves home to go to a desolate location to find himself.  ""Twelve years later,"" which makes him 30-years-old when he announces himself to the world as a super man.\n(As Perry White rants, the reporter who gets his first interview will get the most important story since ""God talked to Moses"").\nLittle touches, I know, but I thought it was interesting to notice now.\n\nActually, what I always remembered was Gene Hackman's funny performance as Lex Luthor.  The two lines my friends still quote are:\n""It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to move those legs.""\nAnd, ""You were followed again...in spite of those cat-like reflexes.""\nThe special effects may look dated and the romance part is a bit much for a comicbook movie, but Hackman is hilarious and Luthor's ""real estate"" plot is the most inspired criminal enterprise since Auric Goldfinger tried to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox.\n\nThe extras are great.  Watching the various actresses doing screen tests, you can see how Margot Kidder really nailed the role.  The others were good but the chemistry is there with Reeve and Kidder.\n\nAlthough it's probably lost on young people today, I loved the shot of Clark Kent running up to a phone booth and looking annoyed at the half-booth (anyone born since this movie came out would not remember that phone booths were once big enough for a man to change clothes in).";"""My only son...."""
53;73.0;2.0;5.0;4814;I saw this movie recently, and despite being a life-long fan of the Superman character and possessor of a very in-depth knowledge of his history and significance, I really didn't like this film. It conflicted too much with the vision of Superman I'd developed on my own. The special effects are strong, but the dialogue is spectacularly cheesy at points, and Superman comes off as too much of an amateurish buffoon for my taste. Lex Luthor has got to be the least credible villain ever to appear in a comic-book film, and his side-kicks Otis and Ms. Tessmacher are probably the two most blatant examples of Hollywood bastardization to ever appear in comic-book film. The characters on a whole aren't taken seriously at all, and its practically a spoof of the source material. Despite what you've been told, it is anything but the definitive Superhero movie. Even as a hardcore DC Comics fan, I think I've got to give that honor to the first X-men film.\n\nP.S: As for the infamous ending... it makes sense if you've seen Back to the Future as much as I have: just because a person goes back to a period in which they already existed doesn't mean their past self no longer exists in that period.

57;43.0;5.0;11.0;4836;"As soon as I heard that Christopher Reeve died the first thing that came to my mind was my favorite scene in ""Superman.""  This is when Clark Kent has spied Lois Lane dangling from a helicopter atop the ""Daily Planet"" building, discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of Metropolis, and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big ""S"" that stands for truth, justice, and the American way.  The second thing I thought about was the director, whose name I forget, who was chastised by a friend for considering Reeve for a serious film since the actor had played Superman.  The director's rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an American icon like Superman (if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film ""Superman Returns,"" and that apparently they have settled on actor James Caviezel, who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people).  Of course, the final thing I thought about with regard to Reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995.\n\nThe tagline for the 1978 film ""Superman"" was that ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the Man of Steel.  Reeve did not even get top billing; in fact he was billed third behind Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Yet the whole movie hinged on Reeve, not only as the heroic Superman but as the purposefully bumbling Clakr Kent.  Of course it was a put on and with Reeve it was clear, as it would become in the DC comics about ""Superman"" after this movie came out, that Superman was the real person and Clark Kent the faux identity (I also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on/off variable Clark and Superman part their hair on opposite sides).\n\nRichard Donner filmed ""Superman"" and a lot of ""Superman II"" at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie (think ""The Three Mustketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"").  But there is decidedly a sense in which ""Superman"" is three different films.  The first, taking place on Krypton, is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led Jor-El to put the infant Kal-El into a spacecraft and send him to Earth to survive the death of Krytpon.  The second, set in Smallville, Kansas, is pure Americana as young Clark Kent (Jeff East) has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on Earth to do something more important than score touchdowns, a lesson imparted by Pa Kent (Glenn Ford, in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious Oscar nomination).\n\nHowever, most of the film takes place in Metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts.  Clark Kent is a klutz, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) a blowhard, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) cannot spell.  Hackman's Lex Luthor has fun going over the top, playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team, Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty).  No wonder Reeve's Superman comes out of this one looking so good; he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else.  The sequence in the film is when Superman follows up his rescue of Lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving Air Force One to rescuing a cat up a tree.  Certainly this Superman has more of a sense of humor than his predecessors, although clearly in an All-American sort of way.  The ending is big in a comic book sort of way, but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when Superman weeps over the body of Lois.\n\nWatch ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" again some time to remember how good Reeve was in the role.  But to honor his memory skip the third and fourth ""Superman"" movies.  If you want more of Reeve then go check out ""Someone in Time"" (another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can ""think"" yourself back in time), ""Deathtrap"" and ""The Remains of the Day.""  If you want more of the Superman mythos the first two seasons of ""Smallville"" are out on DVD, which connects nicely to the second act of this film, while if you catch repeats of ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people.";I certainly believed that Christopher Reeve was Superman

How can you not enjoy Lex yelling ""MS. TESSMACHER!!!!"" or Williams amusing musical cues for Beatty's character?  Chris Reeves now embodies the persevering spirit of a character he played decades ago.  More power to you Chris.  Enjoyable, life-affirming, and classic.\nEssential.";Everything you loved plus more is here.
60;44.0;5.0;12.0;5984;"The late 70s and early 80s was such a fantastic time to be a kid at the movies - the experience of seeing of ""Star Wars"", ""Close Encounters"", ""E.T."" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on the big screen was exciting beyond words.  For me, though, one movie from that period stands a head and (broad) shoulders above the rest: Richard Donner's ""Superman: The Movie"".\nWarner Brothers deserves applause for their TLC lavished on this previously-neglected classic.  Begone with the murky, faded pan & scan abominations - we now have a pristine, colorful transfer that finally restores Geoffrey Unsworth's gorgeous widescreen cinematography.  And if that wasn't enough, we also have 9 extra minutes of (quality) footage, trailers, deleted scenes, screen tests (yeah!) and three new documentaries to boot.\nAnd for Superman fans like me, the documentaries and screen tests are a treasure to behold.  Thank God for Richard Donner - it's scary to think what ""Superman: The Movie"" could've been without his reverent, loving vision of the comic-book legend.  The new interviews with Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder are insightful and often hilarious...  Ms. Kidder, in particular, is a delight.  It's impossible to imagine anyone else as the Daily Planet's intrepid reporter.  Three cheers to Lynn Stalmaster for his dead-on casting!\nAlthough it would've been nice to see a special edition of ""Superman II"" as a companion, I certainly won't complain.  I'm just happy that 20+ years later, ""Superman: The Movie"" is just as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it in theaters.  From the destruction of Krypton, to the famous helicopter rescue, to the earthquake-disaster climax, ""Superman"" is a marvelous piece of cinema (and American pop culture, for that matter).  I don't think I'll ever outgrow it.  Add ""Superman: The Movie"" to your DVD collection today!!";Super entertainment!
61;59.0;5.0;8.0;6059;"I've been waiting for this dvd for many years now, and I'm happy to say that I'm NEVER again watching that laughable Pan N Scan version!!\nThe picture quality is better than I expected. First of all, all the grain that was current in some scenes are gone, and not to mention the green suits! The widescreen version is ofcourse an improvment from the awfull pan n scan version, and I have to say that this movie looks absolutely beutiful in widesreen!\nThe new 5.1 sourround sound is fantastic! It's great to hear the sound coming out of all your speakers. The ""bullet, fire and Ice"" scene is recomended to those who own a dolby 5.1 system!\nWhen you think that new sound and improved picture quality was enough, you thought wrong. The disc(two sides) is loaded with extras! There's three documenteries, Taking Flight:The Development of Superman, Filming the Legend:The Making of Superman, and The Magic Behing the Cape:Special Effects. There's also a commentary track starring director Richard Donner, and Creative Consaultant Tom Mankewicz, aswell as three trailers(one teaser, a trailer and a TV spot). There's also screentest's of Christopher Reeve(Superman), Sahra Douglas(Ursa) and Margot Kidder(Margot Kidder). And for those who don't own the Superman The Movie Rihno soundtrack, then there's also some alternate music not included on the film.\nThis is one of the best DVD's ever made! Highly recomended!";I cannot believe it's finally here!!
62;69.0;5.0;6.0;6060;"It's about blankety blank time!  Superman on DVD!  That simple statement should be enough to make you pull out the old wallet and get your copy NOW!  What can be said about this film that hasn't already?  Richard Donner was the only choice to direct, the casting was just about perfect, Christopher Reeve is Superman, no matter whose played him before and no matter who will ever play him again.  John Williams score takes this movie to another level entirely.  The Superman Theme going through the surround sound during the opening credits brought goosebumps.  The story is great, going from birth on Krypton, growing up in Smallville, and fulfilling his destiny in Metropolis, it's almost like you get three movies for the price of one.  And it works.\nThere are moments that sends chills down the spine, such as Superman's first public appearance (saving Lois and the helicopter).  Some would say that Luthor is played too much for laughs, but I think it works well.  I love Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, he has some of the best quotes in the movie.  ""Doesn't it just give you a... shudder of electricity to be in the same room with me?""  His ego is so huge, it's wonderful!\nAnyways, everything's been said about this movie and I agree with all the positive things. :)  So, on to the DVD!  The sound is FANTASTIC!  If you have a surround sound system, you are in for a treat!  The image is the best I've seen this movie in.  And the extras are... Wow!  The kind of extras you expect to see on a God honest movie classic making it's first show on the superior format that is DVD.  Screen tests, note the huge pools of sweat collecting on the underarms of Chris Reeve's supersuit.  Watch many an actress try their hand at Lois Lane!  Interesting stuff, all of it.  Two or three deleted scenes, nice additions.  A good commentary track with Richard Donner and I forget the other guy's name, but he pretty much wrote the movie, though he is credited as the creative consultant or something of that nature, where they discuss many things about pre-production, production, casting decisions, effects shots and so forth.  And three 20-30 minute documentaries that are very informative.  These are the kinds of docus I like to see.  They include new interviews with Donner, Margot Kidder and a real life superman, Christopher Reeve, looking good considering all the difficulties he's gone through.  Real in depth stuff.\nAll in all an American Classic that gets the DVD treatment it rightfully deserves.";One of the best movies ever!
63;76.0;4.0;5.0;6061;"Man, do I love movies on DVD. How much do I love `em, you ask? Well, it's not just because of the extra features included in the Special Edition presentations. In the case of SUPERMAN The Movie, I decided to make a direct comparison between the DVD and the regular cut VHS edition. I got the disc, rented the tape, and then played both simultaneously on my TV, trying my best to keep them synchronous. I constantly switched back and forth between the VHS and DVD to see exactly which scenes were restored to the Special Edition. Yes, folks, this is my idea of a good time. Sad, isn't it?\n\nBut, thanks to my little side-by-side comparison, I was blown away by the amazing differences between the picture & sound qualities of the two formats of the first flick I ever saw in a theater. I was able to hear all of those subtle little background noises that are harder- if not impossible- to perceive on VHS. The tinkling of broken glass and the upheaval of Krypton's crust following the movies' opening credits is a wonderful example of the DVD's excellent sound variety & clarity. Of course, it also helps when the folks who released the DVD edition decided to enhance the sound as well!\n\nAnother great benefit of the superior audio is a better-sounding musical score. The opening titles theme is by far my all-time favorite piece of John Williams-composed movie music. No previous or subsequent Superman movie or TV show soundtrack score has even come close to capturing the essence of the character like Williams did for this movie. Ofttimes I'll watch the opening credits sequence several times in a row just so I can listen! There's even a music-only track where you can just kick back and play the DVD pretty much like it was a soundtrack CD!\n\nThe picture quality, aside from having a bit of a solarized glow during dissolves, was way sharper that its VHS counterpart. It was so sharp, in fact, I could see the matte borders around Kal-El's geode-cradle space ship-thingy as it flew through the psychedelic cosmos, as well as other limitations of the special effects of that era that were somewhat hidden in the muddier magnetic media. Hmm... perhaps having superior picture clarity isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh? Still, it's kinda cool to look back at the FX of the times and see how far things have advanced since then. Even director Richard Donner gets a bit nostalgic about the ""good ol' days"" of special effects on the commentary track. He also points out a few less-than-magic moments that he and co-commentator Tom Mankiewitz (sp?) get a bit of a laugh out of.\n\nThen there are the new scenes, many of which passed by without me noticing much o a difference. It's likely due to the fact that I kinda remember them, since many of these bits were restored to the network TV broadcasts of the movie back in the 80s. One weird extra smidge of footage was the Kryptonian Council sending an enforcer to stop Jor-El from launching his sons' ship. Strangely enough, this little moment was never followed up; the enforcer was never seen again, save a brief appearance at the beginning of SUPERMAN II. Another cool addition is Superman running through Luthor's gauntlet of bullets, flames, and frost on his way to the criminal genius's lair (in the commentary track, Donner and Mankiewitz discussed the debate they had about whether or not they should have left the gauntlet scene in the theatrical release; they considered it too much of a ""the-audience-already-knows-about-Supes'-invulnerability-so-why-repeat-ourselves?"" thing, and ultimately dropped it). My favorite new moment, however, was an extension of the scene where young Clark Kent outruns the express train running through Smallville. This addition is one of those strange co-inky-dink-twist-of-fate-type moments that classic superhero books seem to have in spades. There's even a couple deleted scenes that weren't reincorporated into the movie involving Miss Teschmacher and Luthors' ""babies"". Fortunately, no footage was shot that made references to Ned Beatty's (Otis) performance in 'Deliverance.' Speakin' of Otis: the interplay between Hackman and Beatty's characters added a great touch of lighthearted humor to counterbalance Luthor's scary scheme to... well, let's just say it involves Luthor's obsession with real estate.\n\nIncluded in the bonus features section (aside from the stuff I've already brought up) is a three-part ""making of"" documentary hosted by Marc ""Jimmy Olsen"" McClure, a teaser trailer, and a couple screen tests featuring a laughably skinny Christopher Reeve in the Big Blue togs before he got himself beefed up for the flick (in the commentary track, Donner mentions that Reeve's personal trainer was David Prowse, better known as the guy inside the Darth Vader suit) . While I've been a bit jaded by DVD bonus features and extras lately, a few of them were almost as entertaining as the movie itself! The part where Richard Donner was confident that Reeve would walk again was kinda sad, however...\n\nBefore I wind this review up, I'll leave you with a totally useless and time-wasting activity for you to perform while watching this film. There's a not-so-magic moment where you can see director Richard Donner's reflection on a pane of glass! He also has an intentional cameo later on in the movie. His brief performance isn't exactly Hitchcockian or Tarantino-esque, but I think he makes out okay. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (he points out both moments) while you're looking! Happy hunting!\n\n`Late\n\nUPDATE 7/20/2006: Ya might wanna hold off on buying this particular edition `til `round Thanksgiving 2006. I've a sneaking suspicion that Warner will be rereleasing this movie as well as all the other ones in super-mega-tricked-out special editions to coincide with the DVD release of ""Superman Returns."" Hey, they did the same thing with the ""Batman"" movies when they put ""Batman Begins"" on DVD; I wouldn't put it past the Warner guys to do it with the Supes flicks, as well...\n\n`Later";Otisburg???
64;45.0;4.0;12.0;6075;I am so glad Superman is now on DVD!  It is one of my favorite features.  The special features on the DVD are very nice.  Christopher Reeve's screen test is finally shown, along with the other actors.  The three feature documentaries were all very interesting, particularly the explanation of what happened to Richard Donner after the first feature.  It shed a lot of light on what happened after the first movie.  It makes you wonder what would have happened to II if Donner had finished it.\nI also enjoyed the audio commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewics.  They provide interesting and funny commentary.  Mankiewics mentions that 70% of II was already finished by the time the first movie came out.  Also note the scene where Donner mentions a real good looking actor that Clark Kent is talking to. When he turns around, it's Donner himself.\nMy only problem with the DVD is the restoration of the previously cut scenes.  Why couldn't they give two versions of the film, one theatrical version and one special version (like the Terminator II and Independence Day)?  These scenes were cut for a reason and they are detrimental to the finished product when they are inserted back in.  The added scenes on Krypton don't amount to much.  Neither does the scene between Brando and Reeve on the Fortress of Solitude.  I also didn't care for the flashy scenes where Luthor tries to kill Superman with the machine guns, fire, and ice methods.  We are supposed to be entertained by how confident Lex Luthor is in his brains.  In the theatrical version, Superman lands in Luthor's hideaway, proceeds to the entrance, and tears down the door.  Luthor calmly sits in his chair waiting for him, poised because he knows he has outsmarted him with Kryptonite.  In this expanded edition, Luthor tries several methods to kill him.  Why does he have to do this when he already has the solution up his sleeve.\nStill, this is a very entertaining DVD and worth buying.  I only wish they would do this with the 2nd one.;Great Superman Movie! A lot of information with DVD features
65;30.0;5.0;19.0;6085;"The name Superman brings back so many memories doesn't it? Well watching this special edition brought back all of those feelings and more. This is a FANTASTIC dvd! All dvd's should aspire to be this good! The other reviews seem to mostly touch on the sound and picture quality (which are great), but I thought I would do a review mostly on the EXTRAS on this disc which are just incredible.\nFirst of all, there are 3, approximately half hour, documentaries on the making of Superman. These are the real gems of this disc. They're great! One involves pre-production, one involves production and one involves the special effects. They are all roughly a half hour each and they are all well worth your time. You see the original screen tests for both Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder plus screen tests of ... Anne Archer, Leslie Ann Warren, Stockard Channing and other famous actresses all tested for Lois and you see them all. I didn't notice anyone famous trying out for SUPES because they decided early on that they wanted an unknown but there are screen tests of plenty of unknowns including the dentist of one of the producers wives! Too funny. There are some great scenes here. The great thing about all these documentaries is that you get to hear from everyone involved in NEW interviews, even Christopher Reeve. Many documentaries or featurettes on other dvd's try and cut together old interviews and try and fool you into thinking you are getting something new. Not here! This is all new stuff! The second documentary even touches on the shady dealings of the producers of this film and all the wrangling done to get this film to the big screen. It's all quite fascinating. The third documentary is on special effects and it shows you numerous flying tests that they tried to get the man of steel to fly. Some are really bad and some are funny, but in the end, they figured it out. Flying is just one part of this documentary, they also go into matte painting, rear projection, front projection and many other techniques that were new to the biz and even effects that had never been attempted until this film. It really shows you the innovations that this film achieved that would set a precedent for future films to come. There's a lot more stuff in these documentaries but I think I'll just let you discover them for yourself.\nThere are ADDED scenes that were not shown theatrically but that are edited back into this ""director's cut"" of this dvd version. Most of them are throw away scenes or ""bridges"" for other scenes but I can't for the life of me figure out why they cut out the ""FIRE AND ICE"" sequence in the original theatrical version. It's fantastic. I also got a kick out of ""little Lois"" on the train.\nThere are 2 deleted scenes, that don't add much to the movie and I can see why they were deleted, but I did laugh at one of them.\nSome of the deleted scenes and the added scenes have been shown in expanded tv versions of this film but if you have never seen them, they are quite a treat and it's just good to have them in your home in such a high quality dvd transfer.\nThe alternate music scores I didn't get much out of and I doubt you will either unless you are a big follower of music scores.\nThe commentary by Director Richard Donner and Creative Consultant Tom Mankiewiczwas was great. You could tell that these two really had a lot of fun making this picture and a lot of love for the final product. They told some great stories on their troubles filming certain scenes, how they hired certain actors and even giving kudos along the way to the behind-the-scenes folk who helped out. There's some great insight on this commentary on how much hard work it really took to get this picture made. Tom has a great memory and seemed to tell a lot of ""little things"" that even Richard Donner had forgotten.\nThe trailers and tv spots were cool to see and they brought back definite memories, including a teaser trailer that I remember way back when, that caused roars of applause from the audience.\nIf you have even a little nostalgia for this film, you are going to love it! Some of the effects don't hold up in this day and age , but a surprising number of them do! I found myself thinking to myself ""how did they do that back in 1978?"". The answer: By Hand. The story is timeless and even though today's younger audience might be jaded with all of today's computer wizadry, I think this movie stands the test of time. Just the EXTRAS alone make this disc worth it. After watching this film, you too will believe a man can fly ... I know I did ...\nENJOY!";If you don't get this dvd, then NO SUPES FOR YOU !!
66;77.0;4.0;5.0;6089;"One of my all-time favorite films has finally been given the DVD treatment.  This long-awaited release was postponed several times (it was supposed to be released last year).  The good news is that the picture has never looked better (Remember watching a grainy out-of-focus Superman: The Movie on television for the last 20 years?).  There is also about 8 minutes of restored footage (mostly with Marlon Brando) which adds a little more to the emotional impact of the film (particularly the added scene with Jor-El in the Fortress of Solitude)\nNow the bad news: There's a scene on Krypton when a Sentinel is sent to arrest Jor-El.  Now we see the Sentinel leaving for Jor-El's quarters in this restored scene, but what we don't see is the rest of this scene, which I felt should've also been restored.  The Sentinel is flying through Krypton's massive canyons only to be killed by a falling building in the Krypton-quake. Also, the sound effects (mostly in the first half-hour of the film) have not been ""enhanced"" as previously announced, but REPLACED with completely different sounds.  This is very distracting, since for the last 23 years you're used to hearing very different things going on in the film (especially in the Krypton scenes). Also the music queues seem to be a little out of sync with some of the movie's scenes.  I read an interview the other day with director Richard Donner, who supervised the restoration.  He claimed to be unaware that the sound effects of the original film were omitted and replaced.  He was told they were simply were being ""enhanced"". (Interesting). Although after stating that, I have to admit that I did like the new sounds in the opening credit sequence.  They add to the anticipation and are really a heart-stopper.\nMy personal opinion is that if you're restoring a classic film, or making a special edition, it's okay to add something (such as deleted scenes) or to enhance something. But you shouldn't REMOVE something altogether (remember the same thing was done by George Lucas in two of the Star Wars ""Special Edition"" films). This disc was also originally supposed to be a 2-disc set containing the original theatrical cut of the film, but I guess they changed their minds for some reason (?).  I guess the sound affects issue probably won't be too big a deal to most people, but for some movie buffs (including myself) it's a little annoying.  For the most part though the DVD is excellent, complete with 3 documentaries, screen tests, trailers and 2 additional deleted scenes (which also should've been restored).\nLet's hope for a Superman II Special Edition next!";Looks Great But Sounds Very Different
67;6.0;5.0;158.0;6098;"At last, Superman is presented the way it was meant to be! The master print for the 1978 classic had deteriorated so badly that the film, particularly the white-on-white Krypton opening scenes, was almost unwatchable. (I had even gone so far as to write a critique on Amazon.com demanding a 'Director's Cut' DVD edition, digitally transferred and remastered, be made!)\n  Somebody was listening! While this isn't a 'Director's Cut' (Donner has said that the version that premiered in 1978 was the version he preferred), the movie has been expanded, to include a couple of brief scenes with Brando, and the famous Superman Gauntlet sequence at Luthor's underground lair (the remaining unused sequences can be seen in the 'Deleted Scenes' Chapter, on Side 2).\nTechnically, the DVD is fabulous; the Krypton sequences are now clean and sharp, a couple of shots where, previously, color balancing problems had turned Superman's costume green have been corrected, and, best of all, the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and sounds even better than it did in 1978!\nThree fabulous documentaries are included on Side 2 about the making of the film, and how the flying effects were achieved. This was an incredibly expensive and difficult film to make (so much so that Donner, after 'Superman' was released to rave reviews, was fired, and replaced by Richard Lester, for 'Superman 2'), and through interviews with Donner, Christopher Reeve (who is honored for his work in the film, and his courage since his crippling accident), Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and several of the creative team, you can appreciate what a unique and wonderful film this is!\nTwo other 'pluses'; a full-length audio commentary track with Richard Donner, and a 'music only' option, where you can admire one of composer John Williams' greatest scores!\nThis Special Edition DVD should be an essential part of any film lover's collection!";'Superman' on DVD...THE one to buy!
68;78.0;5.0;5.0;6123;The movie itself is worthy of the five stars, and no doubt the DVD version lives up its hype.  After years of watching the fuzzy pan & scan monstrosity that was the video version of the movie, I rushed to see SUPERMAN at a midnight movie house near me when they ran one of the prints WB sent out for their 75th birthday a couple of years ago.  It holds up so well -- the scenes in Krypton dole out backstory with ease and Brando adds dramatic weight (ahem) as Jor El.  The Smallville scenes are touching.  The Daily Planet feels real.  Superman's first night out saving the rampaging chopper is a brilliant action sequence.  Supe and Lois' night time flight through the clouds is haunting (with just the right note of camp in Kidder's voice over).  The introduction to Lex Luther / Otis / Miss Tesmacher is just the right shot of comedy to pick up the second half of the movie.  The finale is an awesomely impressive combination of effects and personal drama.  Christopher Reeve is scary good with his roaring grief over Lois' near-death.  This one, unlike the others that followed, has an actual MESSAGE that tracks throughout the story about the dangers of Supe intervening in the course of human events.  The performances are dead on -- Kidder is so good its amazing she didn't become a huge actress after this.  Hackman is infinitely better than Nicholson in BATMAN (which does NOT hold up).  Any one sequence in this movie can be watched in and of itself, or over and over again.;An Americana Classic
69;70.0;5.0;6.0;6163;The moment you hear John Williams opening score, you'll be engrossed in this film.  Arguably, SUPERMAN is the greatest superhero movie ever made (and coincidentally the first movie I ever saw), and definitely one of the last epics to ever hit the silver screen.  Making people take Superman seriously is the hardest task anyone making a comic-related film has ever encountered.  However, director Richard Donner succeeded where eveyone else would've failed by taking the road less travelled, and focused on the mythos of the Last Son of Krypton, and all the empathic human emotions contained within.  Consequently, he set the standard by which all comic-related movies were to be judged for the next 23 years (and beyond)!\nFew recognize, however, that the movie itself helped force the special effects genre into overdrive.  Before SUPERMAN, no one had attempted to truly integrate blue screen effects (even Lucas)with traditional prop special effects.  More importantly, they had never dared to do blue screen in daylight images (due to the black outline and unsteady color caused by the film of the time).  Most importantly, utilizing a person in these images meant movement, something space ships didn't offer up as a problem.  By the time SUPERMAN II came along, the challenges were even greater, including creating an entire city street to destroy!\nFrom beginning to end, SUPERMAN is a legendary fantasy-epic, wherein the Man of Steel ultimately turns his back upon the knowledge of his ancestors in order to save the life of his love, Lois Lane, by turning back time.  Created in an age of art & innocence, SUPERMAN ignores the depressing scientific jargon-babble of today's trekky movies, and refuses to drag you down with over-complicated premises.  Instead, it engages you in a fairy tale come to life (more fantasy than sci-fi).  Simply put:  SUPERMAN may very well be the most FUN movie of all time.;23 Years Later, You'll Still Believe A Man Can Fly...
70;11.0;5.0;87.0;6163;Last night a friend that works at Warner Brothers brought over a surprise: The Superman-The Movie two disc DVD! And after watching it, I've got some good news, and some bad news.\nFirst the good news- This new version is even better that the original edit of the film. A lot more of Marlon Brando's scenes. And the really cool sequence in Lex Luthor's underground hide out where he tries to kill Superman with bullets, fire & cold. Plus more...\nThe picture quality is just stunning. Krypton has this insane glow to it. And the new sound rivals brand new movies. The music is bright & vibrant, swirling all around you, and the entire 5.1 mix is used very well.\nNow, the bad news- There's only the one version of the movie. I had hoped you'd be able to play the original, too.\nMore good news- The second disc has an enormous amount of brand new special features (almost two hours worth.) In their entirety, they seem to transport you back in time to relive the fascinating story of how the two Superman movies got made--up until director Richard Donner was stupidly fired, and not brought back to finish the second film. There's a lot of never-been-seen before, behind-the-scenes footage. In the casting tests you can see early versions of the Superman costume as Chris Reeve plays against many actresses including Leslie Warren, Anne Archer (both who were very good,) and of course Margot Kidder.\nAnd then there are the two exceptional documentaries with new interviews from almost everybody. They follow the history of the two films, and include very interesting business aspects. Chris Reeves' story is very touching.  Also included is a documentary on the special effects with neat(!) early flying tests.\nNow more bad news- My friend took the discs with her.\nTo some up: this is the most complete, classy & top notch DVD package I have ever seen. Very well done !  A+;Superman DVD gets A+
71;56.0;5.0;9.0;6179;Christopher Reeve made me believe a man could fly. This is probably the most anticipated DVD for me since I started my collection. The story of Superman, masterfully directed by Richard Donner, restored to its original glory and with additional scenes, more of the beautiful John Williams soundtrack and commentary is a comic book fan's wet dream - the story of Kal-El, the last son of Krypton, journeying to Earth from a dying world and gifted with powers and abilitiies far beyond mortal men.\nBatman, X-Men, Blade, Spider-Man... *this* is the standard all the rest have to measure up to. Even though III and IV were mediocre to stunningly bad, this movie and the sequel (filmed back to back) were top notch. I can't wait for Superman II to be released in the same manner.;The Greatest Superhero Movie of All Time
72;47.0;5.0;12.0;6241;"Movies based on superheroes are usually very entertaining.  Some of the Batman films and the recent ""X-Men"" have proved that, but even they can't compare to the epic splendor of the first ""Superman"" film.  Director Richard Donnor of the ""Lethal Weapons"" and ""Goonies"" released this film in 1978 to rave reviews and huge box office.  It was one of the most anticipated films of it's time, I'm sure if you were to ask anyone who's old enough they could tell you about the first time they saw ""Superman: The Movie"" in the theaters and what a treat it was.\n""Superman: The Movie"" is a glorious fantasy/adventure full of clever villians, inventive visual effects, huge sets, wonderful music by John Williams, romance, and unexpected humor.  The film closer resembles the spirit of ""Star Wars"" than the thundering action of the ""Batman"" films.  ""Superman"" is a comic book movie, yes, but it's more than that.  For starters, no comic book movie has ever had such faith in it's premise than in ""Superman"".  The film is almost a history lesson for us, taking us back to the origins of the hero on the planet Krypton and following him through his adolescence in Smallville and eventually to his arrival in Metropolis.  Richard Donner has such command of the storytelling here.  He treats the story of ""Superman"" with such respect in placing the Man of Steel in the so-called real world instead of the phony sets that you might come to expect in a film called ""Superman"".  Since Donner gives us a realistic setting, the heroics of Superman are viewed with greater awe by the people of Metropolis, as well as the viewing audience.\nThe greatest praise however rests on the invulnerable shoulders of the man who dons the red cape on screen; Christopher Reeve.  While playing what is essentially a dual role in Clark Kent and Superman, Reeve makes the presence of these characters more effective by giving Clark an off-beat personality and Superman a HEART of steel.  Reeve's Superman is more of a friend than a hero.  He's just a kind man with incredible powers who wants to make the world a better place.  Reeve's spin on the character makes the big S more sympathetic and even human.  Reeve has great fun playing the two personalities off each other.  Even through Clark's feeble dorkiness, you can still sense the intelligent hero hiding behind the glasses and even when Superman romances reporter Lois Lane you sense his vulnerbility and love for her and when he mourns for her we realize that he's more like us than a comic book hero.\nWhile not a hulk-like figure which the early concepts of Superman indicated in the comics, Reeve still provides a powerful prescence proving that it's heart not muscle which makes a true hero.  A cape doesn't hurt though.\nFacing off against the Man of Steel is the mighty Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Hackman's Luthor is one of the screen's greatest film villians.  An evil super genius with world domination on the brain, Luthor is also quite funny. Hackman gives Luthor a spoiled brat quality but also a lethal seriousness with his scenes with Christopher Reeve.  This is an awesome screen rivalry.\nThe music by John Williams is one of his best scores ever if not THE best.  The effects and design of the film make it totally belivable that a man is flying around trying to save the world, and all other technical aspects of the film are first rate.\n""Superman"" is for the kid in us all and for those who still believe in heroes.  A classic filled with affectionate performances, stand up and cheer adventure and wonder which is owed to skilled directon and a terrific lead performance by Christopher Reeve, the one and only Superman.";The One and Only
73;79.0;5.0;5.0;6369;Why don't they make movies like this anymore? I recently saw this film on  AMC in it's letterbox format. Everything is just about perfect. The  casting, the story, and the characters. The special effects hold up  extremely well today(the destruction of California for example). However,  two things really stands out in this film. It has a sense of wonder and  spirit. The movie actually has quite a few moving movements(Superman's  failure to save Lois in time and his reaction to his failure is very  heartbreaking). All this and the impeccable Christopher Reeve, quite  possibly the best Superman ever. His looks and performance as Clark Kent  got him the part, but as Superman, nobody can come close(Dean Cain of Lois  and Clark is number two on the list). Richard Donner's(Lethal Weapon  movies, Ladyhawke) best film. Watch, and you will believe a man can fly.;The best superhero film ever made!
74;29.0;5.0;22.0;6439;"I remember with great anticipation at age 8 seeing this movie on the big screen.  What a majestically marvelous movie that to this day is timeless and holds up immensely well in the light of computer-digital special  effects and sophisticated film-goers.  And Christopher Reeve must remain  the only true and inimitable Superman any generation should ever  know!\nThe problem I have with this VHS version is that too much is  cropped off on the peripheral ends of the screen.  The panning-n-scanning  of the camera becomes trite and tiresome after awhile since this  ""modified to fit your screen"" version compensates to take the  viewer to where the action is.\nPatiently waiting for a widescreen/DVD  version would be beneficial in appreciating this excellent movie classic.  I have seen the letterbox version from laser disc, and it is spectacularly  panoramic by comparison!  Rumor has it that Warner Bros. is planning a  25th Anniversary re-release of ""Superman - The Movie"" for 2003.  Perhaps this will also mean re-implementing the 48 minutes(!) that was cut  from the theatrical release of 1978, but restored and aired (only once!) on  ABC in 1982.  That means this movie is actually a little over 3  adventuresome hours long.\nEven though I still rate this great film 5  stars, this VHS version does absolutely no justice for such a jewel of a  movie.  Wait for a widescreen version before you fly out and buy this one  since it will be the only way to truly appreciate ""Superman.""";"Wait for the DVD/Widescreen Version of ""Superman"""
75;58.0;5.0;9.0;6534;"One of the grandest movies of all time!  Christopher Reeve made his screen debut in the role he would be forever identified. And with good reason.  He IS Superman!  His presence as both Clark Kent and his superhero  alter ego is astoundingly realistic when you consider the fantasy elements  of the story!  He is so real, he simply transcends the screen!  And when  you first see Superman take off, swoop over the camera and fly out of his  ""fortress of solitude"" your breath is taken away by the  believibility of it all.\nAs good as Reeve is, I would be remiss to ignore  the fine performances by the rest of the cast.  Marlon Brando is excellent  as Jor-El.  His time on screen is brief but very worthwhile.  No other  actor could have done as well.  The farewell speech he gives to his son  before sending him on the long journey to earth is very moving and is  reminiscent of at least one biblical passage.  Margot Kidder is very  convincing as Lois Lane.  She makes you believe she is a street wise  reporter who would do anything for a scoop.  Jackie Cooper as the crusty  Perry White is hilarious, particularly when he is reprimanding Jimmy Olsen  as he is putting an order in for coffee: ""And don't call me  sugar"".  Ned Beatty as Otis displays more versatility as an actor in a  role unlike anything he has ever played.  He is very funny.  But chief  among them all and definitely the man from Krypton's equal is S.man's  nemesis, Lex Luthor, portrayed here with equal parts humor and villainy by  the great Gene Hackman.  He should have received a Oscar nomination.\nFrom  start to finish this film is an incredible journey that never leaves the  audience feeling empty.  From the opening scenes on Krypton, through the  last shot of Reeve flying by the camera and smiling as if to say,  ""Don't worry, it's only a movie"", you are never disappointed.  Only the heartless viewer would be unmoved as Clark Kent says goodbye to  his earthly mother.  The scene is beautifully acted and photographed.  And  when Kent first arrives at the Daily Planet there are several good laughs  as Clark is obviously trying to adjust to his dual persona in attempting to  create an image of the klutz.  Once again excellent performing from Mr.  Reeve!\nRichard Donner directs with a sure hand this film that has  everything-belly laughs, edge-of-your-seat excitement, heartwarming drama  and spectacle.  A great script by Mario (THE GODFATHER) Puzo certainly  contributes to the proceedings!  John Williams provides what is one of  his finest music scores and captures all of the many moods of this  incredible movie.\nLike so many others, this reviewer is hoping for the  release of the completely restored version with all of the excised footage.  This version is quite an improvement over the already superb, familiar  release and deserves a wide-screen edition on ALL video formats.  Let's  hope we will see it soon. SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (as it was originally called)  is superb entertainment for ALL ages and deserves to be passed down through  the generations.  We owe it to our descendents.";Superman has never been better!
76;72.0;3.0;6.0;6536;"This is not a knock of Superman, the Movie. Richard Donner's take on the the Man of Steel is a bit overlong, but is terrific, and features a wonderful cast, particularly young Christopher Reeve, who gives Superman a dignity not seen since George Reeves portrayed him, in the 1950s.\nThe  special effects are, for the most part, exceptional, particularly when you  consider that the digital technology we enjoy today was nonexistant in  1978. (It's for this very reason that George Lucas 'remade' Star Wars; we  can enjoy 'miracles' on screen today, thanks to the advancements of the  last few years.) The flying sequences have an airy poetry that had never  been seen in any live action 'Superman' prior to this film.\nThe problem  in S:TM lies in the quality of the master that the video transfers are  being made from. It has aged, and deteriorated considerably over the last  22 years. What compounds the problem is that the 'Krypton' sequence opening  the film was shot 'white on white', which shows the flaws and cracks on the  acetate master worse than any other color combination.\nThis is a  suggestion to Warner Bros...Create a remastered, cleaned-up original,  featuring the deleted scenes (which were aired when the movie was  'expanded' for its first television run), all the trailers, include the  'Making of' documentary, hosted by Reeves, that aired when the film was  first released, add in an audio track with commentary by Donner, Reeve, and  Hackman (getting Brando to participate is too much to hope for!), include  an 'audio only' track of John Williams' fabulous score. Those of us who love this film  (and there are a LOT of us!) would shell out the money for this truly  'special' presentation, and future generations would be able to see  'Superman' the way he was MEANT to be seen!";The Man of Steel Needs  a Tune-Up!
77;80.0;2.0;5.0;6551;I wtrote this review several months ago but somehow it got dropped off. Superman The Movie is a great movie, one of my favorites, that deserves to be restored digitally in widescreen format. But this version is horribly  disappointing!  I bought the most expensive VHS I could find online,  which was this clamshell version, to try to get widescreen (this was before  you could get full descriptions). I left it in shrinkwrap until I was ready  to see it again. What a disappointment! The video quality of this copy was  washed out and has so many dust spots, scratches, and other flaws that it  looks as though someone went to a second run theater and just videoed a  tired old screening. I have a high-quality VCR & TV on which other VHS  tapes look awesome. Wait for a remastered version!;Great movie but horrible image quality!
78;40.0;5.0;14.0;6575;"People who consider this to be a ""children's movie"" probably a) never saw the movie, or b) saw it many years back when they were kids, and hence, could not fully appreciate the magnitude of the film's achievement.\nThe biggest hurdle was to convince viewers that ""this is no  fantasy"", as Marlon Brando states in the film's opening line. This  immersion is partly due to an ingenius screenplay, which essentially  portrays Superman as an orphan who discovers his destiny to be the Savior.  All the actors give brilliant performances, especially Reeve in his dual  role, Hackman (as Luthor), Kidder (as Lois Lane), and Glenn Ford (as Pa  Kent).\nThe prologue, although quite long, is not to be missed.  Blazing  credits are pitted against the backdrop of beautiful photography and a  glorious John Williams score. Keep the volume on high with stereo surround  speakers to fully enjoy the introduction and for the musical cues  throughout the movie as well. The special effects, by and large, are still  very impressive. None more so than the famous helicopter sequence, which is  perhaps the greatest rescue in cinematic history. The flying effects that  were done in-camera are also remarkable.\nMy only criticism is that a  controversial plot development towards the very end of the movie injects a  dose of unnecessary science fiction, which contrasts the realism that is so  constant throughout.\nDirector Richard Donner met the challenge of making  us believers. The movie gives us a ""human"" superhero who we  really care about and admire. ""Superman"" has a timeless appeal  for all generations and age groups.\nAlso worth noting for those who  can't get enough of Reeve: a couple of very dramatic scenes surprisingly  did not make the editor's cut and can only be seen in the extended version,  which runs an extra 40 minutes. The film is set to be re-mastered for DVD  release sometime late in 2000. A 2003 theatrical re-release is being  considered for its 25th anniversary. Keep your fingers crossed.";Children's movie? No. Underrated? Yes.
79;49.0;5.0;12.0;6646;A wonderful, entertaining movie.  The best ever adaptation of a comic book to film, great special effects, terrific story and phenomenal direction  make this movie something to see.  The opening credits alone are the most  spectacular of any movie made so far.  The special effects hold up rather  well.  Some of the characters are bit over the top.  Clark Kent may be seen  as a little too wimpy, Otis may be too extreme of a doofus, but they are  surrounded by characters who manage to be wholly credible.  Kudos to Mario  Puzo for his script and story (he also worked on Superman II, and his  absence was noticed on III and IV: The Quest for Peace) The only other  possibly superior interpretation of The Man of Steel is the first season of  Lois and Clark. But still, a movie of this much grandeur and spectacle,  which is superior in every way to all of the Batman movies combined (sorry,  Tim.  Love your work, but this movie is better), should be viewed in its  original widescreen format.  Warner Bros. should get off their butts and  give a good digital remastering and widescreen release onto video and/or  DVD.;Where's the Widescreen Version?

0;1.0;1.0;11.0;0;####------[Review Update: March 12th, 2018]-----####\n\nWell this is a bummer, this second set i ordered to replace the first set that was defective seems to be showing signs of failure already after putting it through hours of testing and use over the course of a few weeks. The Bass knob has developed a lot of play in it, almost wobbly feeling. The left speaker has developed a hiss that changes in frequency from low to high and will drive you nuts when trying to sleep. I checked my power in the house for grounding issues and what not, everything is wired correctly. The other set i returned before this never made any hissing noise but it did have the issue where the speaker channels were wired wrong and reversed.\n\nI tried the speaker set at a family members house and my neighbors house and it was still noisy and hissing. Also the subwoofer gets so hot that it will borderline burn your fingers. No Joke! If you have small children, i suggest you not let them near the back of the subwoofer unit where the amplifier is housed. To top things off, where it gets so hot it puts off a burnt electrical odor that smells terrible in the small room it was placed in.\n\nThis product really seems to be plagued by very poor QC and it uses Very Very cheap components inside. I looked at the electronics enclosed and it's just the cheapest of the cheap straight out of China. Since it has Klipsch branding on it, you get the privilege of paying a extra $100 on what should be a $50 set of speakers.\n\nSending these back and going with something else sadly. I will not buy anything made by Klipsch again due to the poor quality and for having the nerve to slap $150 price tag on something that clearly should be no more than $50. Adjusting my final review to 1 star and will not be ordering a third set. I gave them two shots and they failed me both times. The old third time is a charm saying doesn't work with me.\n\nI hate to say it and you're free to do as you please with your money but heed my advice and spend your hard earned money on something that has good or at least decent quality because if you're buying these then you're flushing your money down the drain. On that note i leave you with this summary.....\n\nplanned obsolescence\npland bslesns/\nnoun\nnoun: planned obsolescence\n\n  a policy of producing consumer goods that rapidly become obsolete and so require replacing, achieved by frequent changes in design, termination of the supply of spare parts, and the use of nondurable materials.  ####-------[End Review Update]--------####\n\n####-----[Review Update: February 24th, 2018]-------####\nFinally got around to getting another set of these speakers. This new set is wired correctly with no swapped left and right channels. The manufacture date on the box is dated June 2017. They even seem to have a slightly better sound than the defective pair i sent back. Only time will tell how long these hold up. I'm pretty happy at the moment as they sound pretty damn good for computer speakers. I give it a solid 4 stars now and knocked 1 star off for time lost dealing with the return process of the defective set i sent back. I will update if any other oddities may arise.  ####------[End Review Update]-------####\n\n####--------[Original Review]---------####\n\nDefective product from seller Audio Plaza, this was a 5 star but i have since updated my review as i just now noticed after reading other reviews and through my own testing that the left and right sound channels are swapped and not wired correctly and i traced it to to the volume control box thats mounted to the right speaker where you control the volume and bass levels. Inside the volume control box are two wires that go to the 3.5mm male jack that you plug into your computer or any device with a 3.5mm female input, these two wires are crossed and can only be fixed by resoldering the wires to their correct solder points on the board in the volume control box.\n\nI can ghetto fix the speaker issue by just switching the speakers wires to the opposite channels on the subwoofer but the headphones connection on the controller box does the same thing and can not be ghetto fixed without voiding the warranty due to soldering being involved to properly fix it. If i was past warranty i would have fixed it myself as i would have no choice by then. Since it's still within the return window, i will send them back and try another pair. I will update this to show how the new set works and if the issue has been resolved.\n\nI think some of these sellers on here are getting these defective sets on the cheap and selling them full price on Amazon or could just be a bad batch considering they are manufactured in China where QC is basically nonexistent. Check your speakers though as this is something very easy to overlook like i did initially. I mean who the heck would think you would get a defect like this from a brand like Klipsch?\n\nBeware future buyers and check for this issue by adjusting your sound balance from left to right in Windows or your OS of choice. In my case by adjusting the balance, it revealed that right was left and left was right and it was the same with headphones plugged into the speakers headphone jack. The manufacture date sticker on the box was dated March 2017. Could just be a bad batch but makes you wonder when dealing with third party sellers.\n\nThe speakers sounded great and functioned well besides the issue i listed above and is why i didn't notice the issue until messing with some EQ settings and adjusting the balance. Afterwards i did some digging and found other reviews with the same issue on here. bummer. i will be sending them back sadly as they sound great otherwise. Hope this has been of help to someone.;Defective: Speaker Channel Issues/Poor QC...
1;19.0;1.0;5.0;40;Speakers are great.  BUT... West Audio is not an authorized Klipsch dealer so there is no warranty.  I sure as hell wish I'd done my research before purchasing.  Go to the Klipsch website and look at their list of authorized online dealers.;West Audio is not an authorized Klipsch dealer so there is no warranty.
2;20.0;4.0;7.0;103;Great speakers...there are 2 improvements I would recommend....have an on/off switch for the speakers ( you'll have to pull the plug out to shut them off when you turn off the computer ) and make the volume and subwoofer knobs shorter and wider...they work fine but could get broken off easy if you bump them the wrong way.....they sound great...just be careful the way you handle them.;Great speakers.
3;6.0;1.0;18.0;115;This product has really gone down hill. It used to be a very good speaker system for a desktop setup. However, with this latest version, they removed the power button, so now when you switch from headphones to the speakers, you get a loud pop and buzz. Terrible. In addition, there is now a low level hiss that comes from the speakers at all times. This did not happen with the older pair of these that I had. This was so annoying in a quiet room that I had to return them. Really disappointed. Some engineer thought it was a good idea to save .40 cents on the power supply and make a cheaper one and instead ruined a good system.;Has gotten cheap and noisy
4;30.0;2.0;5.0;130;These really sounded nice for about 2.5 weeks, but then died in a 1 minute span - one channel, then the other, then loud popping sounds coming out of them. (usually used them at about 20% capacity)  Never was able to get them to amplify input signals again. I talked to Tech Support, but once they found out I got them from West Audio, who is not an authorized retailer, they closed my ticket.  So, get a warranty.;Sounded nice, but failed in a hurry
5;28.0;5.0;6.0;175;Great system, the bass is top notch. Had mine for five years until the subwoofer speaker gave out on me (I blast my speaker at high volume). But no need to buy the entire system again, simple by a stand alone 6.5 woofer speaker 6 ohm. The metal grille is removable, use a couple of fine screwdrivers, it pops right out, remove old speaker, place the new one, and presto, brand new system for $25-$40, depending where you buy your speaker from. I highly recommend the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1. I bought mine from Best Buy.;Subwoofer Speaker can be replaced...and it's removable.
6;47.0;2.0;6.0;368;They sound great and worked great before they broke, but after 14 months of light use they no longer work. After looking around online it seems there's known issue with the fuses internal to the subwoofer.\n\nI contacted Klipsch and they said I was out of luck due to it being past the 12 month warranty date and recommended some parts I could use to fix them on my own. I wish they would stand by their products for a little longer than 12 months and step in to help out. If I dropped the speaker or was mistreating it that would be one thing, but a blown fuse inside the subwoofer seems to be shoddy worksmanship that they should offer to fix.;Worked Great for 14 Months
7;55.0;5.0;5.0;379;I expected good sound. What I got was great sound. The sound is crisp and clear and has great punch. The subwoofer will literally shake the house. I was not expecting such a huge sound from such a small package. I am very impressed.;I expected good sound. What I got was great sound
8;56.0;5.0;5.0;384;I have 3 of these now, in office, shop and home..... They are fantastic sound quality. You can't beat them for the quality and price!\nThe only issue that I have with them over time, is that the input jack starts to short out. I plug and unplug from phones, ipads etc all the time, and the connection plug is a weak point!\nIt would be nice if they could work on that a bit, but otherwise..... I will keep buying them!;They are fantastic sound quality
9;57.0;2.0;5.0;391;I have had these for several years and the sound and low-end have always been fantastic. Unfortunately, the craftsmanship and decision to use cheap plastic parts has now rendered mine unusable.\n\nI recently moved the system from downstairs to upstairs and after placing the speakers where I wanted them it was time to reconnect the wires. Upon trying to reconnect the wires, 2 of the four clips broke and fell out of the sub-woofer into my hand. No, I did not push too hard, and no I am not an ogre... instead it would seem that with a few years age, the connectors and the myriad of plastic parts have become brittle and therefore cracked. After the event, a google search tuned up multiple similar stories.\n\nSo, buyer beware, the price is good. The sound is great, if you plan to move them around or keep them more than a few years, you may want to look elsewhere. It's a shame that Klipsch did not just pony up a few extra cents to make those connector parts out of metal or at least better plastic that wouldn't become brittle and break.;That which was loved now is loathed.
10;32.0;1.0;10.0;612;Sound is pretty good but the knobs have spotty connections so you have to fiddle with them to get sound from both speakers. What's the point in that? I wish I had the box they'd be on their way back right now. I guess it's a sample variance but buyer beware.;Knobs were no good.
11;45.0;5.0;8.0;620;After moving and having my Harmon kardon soundsticks II damaged I decided to see what else I could get for around the same price.\n\n Having a home theater setup with Klipsch I decided to try them out for my computer. Hands down the best computer speakers for the price I have ever used. Sound quality blows away the soundsticks which I thought were impressive for computer speakers, these bring a new level of power and crispness which the sound sticks lose as the volume is increased. The sub also provides a great amount of bass without the issue of plastic rattling found in the soundsticks with age or increased bass.;Hands down the best computer speakers for the price I have ever used
12;22.0;5.0;16.0;643;These are the best computer speakers I have ever used or heard and I have heard quite a few.  I had a set years ago that I loved to no end but the DIN cable died and I didn't know then how to fix it.  I almost cried.  I've used a few sets in the mean time, and nothing comes close to these when it comes to sound quality.  This is my second set and I am never buying anything else ever again.  When this set first arrived, the box had been damaged on the woofer side.  I went ahead and set it up, just to be sure and it was indeed damaged.  I let the company know and they replaced it, paid the shipping for the defective one and the new one works fine.  I hooked this set into my TV so I could play Fallout with some real sound and now I want another set for my PC.  Gaming in this thing sounds amazing.  Movies have full bass, the room rumbles but it isn't painful, just full and satisfying.  Music has never sounded better than on these speakers.  Even with the bass up, it just never drowns out the music, it always sounds balanced and clear.\n\nThe balance on these is by far the best.  They are clear, crisp, but smooth.  The higher ranges are sweet without being piercing, which is a big one for me as the higher pitches tend to bother me if not well calibrated.  The mid-tones are warm and strong and the bass is like Dove chocolate, rich and smooth.  One of the best things about this set is that the bass has its own volume control so you can adjust it to your tastes.  I like it louder for gaming, movies and music, but softer for casual TV watching.  If you really want to hear them, last time I checked Best Buy carries them and usually has them hooked up so you can hear them.  Nothing else compares.  I've heard more expensive speakers and they are never as good, not Bose, not Cambridge.  These are simply the best.\n\nThe only downside to them is that pesky DIN connector in the back of the sub-woofer.  It will probably fail at some point, they are known to do that.  Thankfully, they are repairable and well worth fixing.  I highly recommend this set audiophiles.;The best.
13;72.0;5.0;5.0;745;These are amazing speakers.  After hearing them I immediately understood why they're recommended as the high-standard in 2.1 desktop speaker systems.\n\nMy previous speaker setup was a Logitech 5.1 system.  It was great, but re-purposed in a media room.  And, I was getting a little tired of having a big 5.1 system on my desktop (I prefer a minimal approach).  These Klipsch speakers were immediately recommended and I'm very happy with them.\n\nThey're obviously less clunky and more suited to a desktop than the 5.1 system I had, but there are a few other reasons why I prefer these over the Logitech's I had.\n\nFirst, the quality and value difference is immediately apparent.  For example, the satellite speakers come with sturdy metal stands, not cheap breakable plastic like the Logitech's (trust me, I know, I had a Logitech stand break).  They're also noticeably heavier in general and don't shift on their own or while inadvertently making contact with other objects being moved around on my desk top.  You also get tweeters on the satellite, which are an omission on the Logitech's.\n\nSecond, the volume and sub controls are on one of the satellite speakers, which makes adjustments very easy.  The Logitech's actually had a separate device to control volume and sub, which contributed to even more wire and desk top clutter.\n\nThird, the sound quality is amazing.  These things sound noticeably more clear, especially in the highs, than the Logitech's.  The sub still provides plenty of low-end, but the satellites really shine due to the included tweeters.  These Klipsh just sound more clear and articulate compared to the Logitech's.\n\nOverall I'm glad I paid the extra money for these.  Should they ever go out, I'll immediately order another set.;Amazing sound and value!
14;64.0;1.0;6.0;751;I originally had a 4/5 review when I first got these speakers because they were just slightly tinny but otherwise seemed fine.  Two days later, one of the subwoofer channels just stops.  I've tested both satellite speakers on the other working channel and the speakers work fine, but the channel just won't work.  These speakers didn't move at all during this time, just stayed on my desk.  After checking online, it seems Klipsch is notorious for having fuses blow all the time in the channels.  I used to have an older pair of Klipsch that also blew fuses, and I just thought they were a fluke and haven't used them in years.  But this is now YEARS later and fuses are still blowing in standard day-to-day use.\n\nThis is unacceptable, and I will never be buying a pair of Kilpsch speakers again.  I strongly recommend anyone considering these speakers to go elsewhere.;Poor quality product, fuses break consistently
15;43.0;5.0;9.0;774;Klipsch. The name carries a lot of weight in my house.  My home audio and home theater systems are powered by Klipsch Legacy speakers...the BIG ones (Klipshorn and LaScala). My earbuds are Klipsch (the superb, but discontinued Custom 3 earbuds (at $300.set).\nI just had a new computer custom built, and decided it was time to upgrade from my inexpensive computer speakers to these bad boys, And am I ever glad that I did.\nThe sound, for the price, is amazing. The bass is deep and tight, the midrange is pleasing and accurate, and the treble is crisp and clean.\nThey bring computer audio to new heights.\nAre these as good as my $8,000 K-horns? Of course not. But are they good enough? They are MORE than good enough.\nI suspect one would need to spend at least 5 times as much to get anything that exceeds these in quality. If your computer is your entire home entertainment system, maybe that would be worth the price.  But for computer speakers that are THX Certified, sound great, and can rattle the fillings out of your teeth, these cannot be beaten with a stick.\nI was doubly fortunate to have purchased them when they were on sale for just $109. That made then too good to pass up, and somehow, made the sound all the sweeter.;Buy these. You will be glad you did.
16;39.0;1.0;10.0;846;Bought this sound system because of the great reviews.  Sounded great the first day I bought it, then I realized there was a clicking, static noise coming from the satellite speakers.. This was on the 2nd day owning these speakers.  I looked online and apparently this happens all the time with these speakers which is quite unfortunate.  After about a week of owning these speakers I'm a bit disappointed.;Brand New and Produces Static Noise
17;27.0;5.0;14.0;870;"These are hands down the best PC Speakers I have ever owned. I exclusively have used mid to high end Klipsch Speakers for my Home Theater that's 5.1 (All Klipsch), Since those first set of 5.1 Klipsch speakers I bought over 10 years ago, to my newest ones, I was in love with the clarity and ability for them to hit the high and lows so accurately and also output good clean bass for perfect sound. Now the Home Theater features a Denon X4000 Receiver feeding those Klipsch speakers, but these Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 Speakers are nothing short of spectacular! For about 2 hours I have been listening to some music from a few Linkin Park, Nine Inchs Nails and some kinda softer stuff songs and it's like I'm hearing them for the first time. They are pretty much the same quality as my Home Theater if it were 2.1. I'm serious. These sound that good. I got mine as an open box item on ""An Auction Site"" and they look brand new and hookup was simple. My ASRock Motherboard features a Realtek ALC898 7.1 CH HD Audio Codec which is pretty darn good. But anyway you look at it if you want speakers you can Play LOUD and also have a lot of Base with perfect clarity these are worth the investment. My old M-Audio Studio PC Speakers (No-Sub though) connected to a dedicated Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium HD Sound Card using RCA Jacks to the card and it sounded no where as good as these ProMedia's do. That Sound Card and those M-Audio sounded good though, just nothing like the ProMedia 2.1 do with my on-board sound. Trust me. You won't regret these if your looking something that sounds amazing on a PC. Plus for the price is as low as it for something of this high quality. It's hard to find Great Speakers in the PC Category. Anyway, buy these and you will rediscover your music and Movies as well.\n\nUPDATE 9/13/2015 -\n\nThese speakers are flat out incredible! After a full day using them I am just blown away at the quality of the sound and HOW LOUD they can get!";Building PC's for Over 20 Years and Never has a Speaker System for Any PC Sounded This Good!
18;59.0;5.0;7.0;893;Being a musician, I really pay attention to quality and detail of sound.  These computer speakers are definitely the best value out there.  If you want very good sound quality at a very reasonable price, go with Klipsch Promedia 2.1.;These computer speakers are definitely the best value out there
19;53.0;4.0;8.0;897;"I bought a set of these for one workstation and liked them so much I purchased a second set for another computer.  They are well-built, good sounding computer speakers, but don't confuse them with actual high-end music reproduction transducers, for they are not that.  Klipsch was a well-known name in the early days of stereo and concert-hall speaker systems, had a bad period (ok, bad decade) where they made a lot of junk, and now seem to be enjoying something of a renaissance by producing things that don't sound too bad at all.\n\nThe subwoofer can easily overpower the much smaller mid/high speakers so most of us normal people will never need to turn it up beyond 1 or 2 (unless you're into a physically percussive experience that may damage retinas or other organs).  The construction is high quality, there's no skimping on cable length, and the speaker stands are heavy but bendable steel, making it easy to aim them properly while still remaining quite stable.  I put flat rubber feet on the bottom of mine so they wouldn't slide around.  They do not seem to cause interference with any other device (eg picture quality on monitors), and no other device seems to interfere with them or cause problems (eg noise or crackling).\n\nI'm deducting a few points for the weird DIN plug used to connect everything - if that breaks or you bend a pin, the whole system is kaput. Also in the arena of minor annoyances is that the LED power light is -very- bright, and annoying if it happens to be right front of you (like, say, anytime you're listening to something).  There is no power on-off switch.  The provided stands are about 7"" deep and 4"" wide, and it appears they can be removed (perhaps for wall mounting).They are matte black and are likely to be quite unobtrusive in most settings (except for that obnoxious LED power light).\n\nOverall very happy with these for general viewing/listening purposes.";Excellent computer speakers, but don't confuse them with high-end stereo speakers
20;79.0;1.0;5.0;898;"This system is awesome. Great sound, and I am a high quality audio kind of guy. I purchased the system on 2/7/15.

These are just lovely lovely musical speakers to listen to.\n*****/Edit*****\n\nThis is a placeholder review to enable me to upload some comparison photos of the original version of the amplifier module these speakers used to ship with versus the new version.\n\nThe original speakers were absolutely excellent and gave a full decade of fairly hard daily use before the neoprene bellows on the subwoofer's driver/speaker failed. It remains to be seen how long the new version will last, and indeed how they sound, they've obviously moved to a Class D amp for the sub at least, which concerns me mightily.\n\nSome hard numbers on the original versus the new; Original amp module weights 3280 grams and is attached to a .1"" thick steel backing plate. The new amp module weighs 820 grams and is attached to a .05"" thick steel backing plate.\n\nI will update this review if I find anything specific (good or bad) to say about the audio quality in comparison to the original version.";A very very different speaker to the one you may fondly remember.
22;61.0;3.0;7.0;937;Klipsch Promedia 2.1 vs Logitech Z623\n\nThis review is for all the folks who are deciding between buying the Logitech Z623 and Klipsch Promedia 2.1 for a well-rounded 2.1 audio system with the best bang for the buck. I was literally torn between the two systems based on my inability to compare both of them side by side in any store. Neither BestBuy, Frys, HH Greg nor any other major electronics store had these two at the same time to get a decent comparison. Also, it is nearly impossible to really understand how these would sound in a store environment where there is a lot on ambient noise, open space and lack of an acoustic room. So, I decided to purchase these two, try these at home and then return whichever I found lacking in certain aspects.\n\nBased on my evaluation, I decided to keep the Logitech Z623.\n\nI evaluated the systems, using several music tracks which included classical, pop, rock, trance and hip-hop and played them simultaneously on both the systems at same decibel levels in increments. Apart from this, I also played certain movie scenes which were bass heavy (for low frequency range), treble heavy (high frequency) and also scenes having dialogues (for mid-range evaluation). I am not a gamer and so did not evaluate the sound for this.\n\nMids and Highs - The satellites on the Klipsch, feature a mid-range driver and a tweeter. I thought this would provide a crisper sound, especially in the high frequencies. This might be true in certain instances. However, where I felt the Klipsch fell short were in the sound integration of the two drivers. Depending on your ear level, there seemed to be a sweet spot where these provided more clarity in overall sound over the Z623. However, if you moved around or up/down, either of the driver seemed to overpower the other. So, for instance, If I were kneeling, in a direct ear level line with the mid driver, the mid range frequencies seemed to be more prominent. And if I were to stand up the tweeter seemed to overpower the mid. This is a huge downfall in my eyes. The sound coming from the tweeter and mids, should be well balanced & blended in seamlessly. It should feel like both the drivers work together to provide a perfect acoustical blend. Period. This was not the case with the Klipsch. The Z623 seemed to have a much better balanced sound coming from the satellites, given that they have only a single full range driver. The sound also seems to envelope the listener much better than the Klipschs. Although, I would have preferred a slightly sharper sound from the Z623 on the highs.\n\nBass  - The Z623 sub produced a well-balanced bass. Surprisingly, upon doing a bass test, the Z623 had audible bass upto 20HZ ! The Klipsch sub pretty much went inaudible at 35HZ. The bass on the Z623 will actually rattle the hell out of windows and any other loosely secured items in the room. However, the bass from the Z623 lacked the thump feel where I would I have expected it to be and this is where the Klipsch scored over the Z623. The bass on the Klipsch is more boomier than the Z623. However, this is only true until about 1/3rd the level on the bass knob. Beyond that, the Klipsch bass starts distorting and sounding purely bad. It lacks the fidelity at higher volumes. At about 2/3rd volume, the Klipsch driver actually starts making internal thud noise, which completely messes up any audio.\n\nThe Z623, holds up very well even at full bass levels. The bass sounds more distributed and does not cause any of the above issues.\nAdditionally, the Z623 also has a lot more input ports, looks more aesthetically pleasing and is actually cheaper than the Klipsch. I also read a lot of review with the Klipsch having quality issues and the speakers failing after a few months or years.\n\nIndependently, both the systems sound great. However, on a head to head comparison, I would definitely choose the Logitech Z623.;1 audio system with the best bang for the buck
23;29.0;1.0;14.0;996;I purchased these to replace my old ProMedia I bought back in 2008 because the subwoofer started rattling and sounded distorted. I noticed the new subwoofer did not have a power switch and a fuse on the back like the old one did. Also, the new subwoofer was lighter than the old one.\n\nAfter I hooked them up and played music through them, it sounded nothing like my old ProMedia did. The old one sounded fantastic, almost as good as my 3.1 Home Theatre speakers. The new ones sounded flat and lifeless in comparison. If you were to put the old ones in one room and the new ones in another room, you would definitely hear the difference in sound quality, like the difference between night and day. How could that be I wondered? Did I get a bad set?\n\nThen I read that Klipsch redesigned the subwoofer that used to contain a discrete power amp with separate output transistors and power supplies, and changed it to a chip amp. No wonder the difference in sound. I returned them the next day. I'm now looking into buying the ProMedia 2.1 Wireless, the subwoofer looks like the old design with the power switch and fuse on the back. Hopefully it will sound as good as my old ProMedia and will spare me the aggravation of repacking, returning them, and waiting for a refund.\n\nThis is a trend I'm seeing more and more of these days. Manufacturers take a product that is perfectly good and start tinkering with it and redesigning it and end up screwing it all up.;Klipsch Took Something That Was Perfectly Good & Screwed It Up
24;65.0;2.0;7.0;1027;"This is an unusual review for me because I really hated to give just 2 stars on these Klipsch ProMedia Computer speakers. This is because I'm an experienced Audiophile and I'm a big Fan of my 2 Klipsch RF7II Reference grade Home Tower Speakers. (Of course I was not expecting that kind of sound from these desktop computer speakers.) These were for my sons computer and I thought I would trust Klipsch on a nice 2.1 PC speaker set. Note to Klipsch; Stick to Reference grade home audio speakers because your PC speakers are awful. I will explain now why you should not buy these and what to buy if you want solid 2.1 PC speakers... 1. These Klipsch speakers have very weak sounding L&R speakers no matter how you adjust settings. 2. The L&R speakers are seriously lacking in Freq range. 2. The Subwoofer, while fairly powerful is lacking that ""fast firing and solid punch you in the chest feel."" No matter how you adjust your sound settings and the gain on the subwoofer you will not get good music or gaming sound from these speakers. Overall sound power was also lacking. (To me they sound much more like a 50w RMS set of speakers.) What I should have purchased for $15 less: For my PC I have the Logitech 2.1 200w Computer speakers and they are great. With my 200w Logitech speakers I get very nice mid, low and high frequency sound that is VERY powerful. These Klipsch were for my son and given I love my Klipsch Home tower Reference grade speakers so much I thought I would get these for him. Conclusion? don't waste your money and by the Logitech 2.1 PC speakers. Buyer BEWARE.";Shame on Klipsch...
25;17.0;3.0;30.0;1049;The item was advertised 10/10. 3 of the 4 foot stands were missing from the subwoofer which also is scratched and one of the grills for the smaller speakers has a small rip at the corner. The performance is great. Photos taken when the listed item were taken out of the box.;Speakers were not as advertised.
26;23.0;1.0;21.0;1126;This, March 2011, purchase was my for my wife's computer. I now owned two of these systems. The first was purchased in 2003 and has lasted now 11 years. The system I purchased 3/2011 lasted 11 months. The only problem with the older system, which has been running non-stop now for 11 years, is the volume potentiometer is bad and now the left speaker only works if I turn the volume way up otherwise it works great. Back to 2011 purchase. The sub woofer/amplifier combination look the same  on the outside. but there are huge differences on the inside and cabling. Just a quick peek inside reveals how lame the new design is using off-the-shelf ASICs instead of the quality parts found in the versions sold in 2003. The new Klipsch sounded no better than the Logitech Z623 speakers which we replaced the faulty Klipsch system that failed after 2 months. These internal design differences, being electrical, do affect the quality of the sound but most importantly quality and reliability. My new Klipsch system purchased from Amazon quit working after a 11 months. The cabling differences prevents me from combining the parts of both systems to make one good functioning system. At $150+ I paid for this system, it should have lasted  more than a 12 months. Apparently they are using their past reputation to get premium prices for poorly built low quality products.;Klipsch cruising on past reputation for quality
27;7.0;5.0;46.0;1143;Here's my video how-to remove the Klipsch control pod (http://youtu.be/WN-bv6Msws0)... Most people don't realize that it's removable! You can situate your speakers on the corners of your desk and keep the volume/bass controls front and center.\nNow, these are the absolute best computer speakers. I mean, these sound insanely good! I'm a Klipsch customer for life.\nI run a global equalizer on my Mac (Using an app called Hear, much better then my previous EQ called Boom), which makes the output unrivaled. I've never been so satisfied with desktop speakers. Trust Klipsch. Trust THX. Run an equalizer. Profit!;It Even Has a Removable Control Pod!
28;95.0;5.0;5.0;1148;I've been a hard core Klipsch fan since the 70's, but I had reservations about ordering these due to the low price for anything Klipsch. My fears were settled completely as soon as I hooked them to my computer. Whoa! I've heard some high end Bose systems that I was impressed with (expensive), but these babies blow them away. The highs are super smooth and sweet, and there's nothing thin sounding about them. Very unlike the traditional Klipsch horn type speakers that audiophiles either love or hate., As I said, sweet, smooth and rich. The sub is equally as good. The bottom end is super tight and clear and I can pick out every single bass note without excessive volume.. Nothing muddy about it at all. Operation is simple. Turn up the speakers or the sub individually. I thought I would at least have to play with the EQ on my computer, but nope, the speakers and sub just enhanced the settings I already have. I think I paid $179 for these babies, and I consider that the best deal I've gotten in a very long time. I can't sing the praises of these speakers enough.;The highs are super smooth and sweet
29;96.0;3.0;5.0;1169;"Firstly I would like to say, I have owned a promedia 2.1 for about 15 years. The new models are probably a 5 / 5 for the average user but I would like to say that this system, while VISUALLY the same is COMPLETELY different sounding. To me, the new system is a 3 / 5, and the old system a 5 / 5. I consider myself of somewhat of an audiophile.\n\nThe things that have changed over the years.\n\nTHE OLD PROMEDIA 2.1\nThe old promedia 2.1 is a 5/5 for computer speakers, had a fused power supply, a much beefier power transformer and power supply, different A/B amplifier unit and crossover network, a power on / off button on the subwoofer and audio jacks for the back of the speakers. The sound from the original satelite speakers are smooth, not harsh and bright. This is either because the crossover networks have changed or the speakers themselves have changed. I believe it is due to the crossover networks changing (now Klipsh is cheaping out). This system is not overly ""boomy"" and delivers clean mids and highs that don't hurt the eardrum and is enjoyable to listen to at loud audio levels.\n\nTHE NEW PROMEDIA 2.1\nThe new promedia 2.1 did one thing right, they replaced the straight connector on the back of the subwoofer with a 90 degree system connector. The rest went horribly wrong. The system is unbearably bright, (typical Klipsh) and the subwoofer is really boomy. The system volume is not linear for the satelites and the subwoofer meaning when you turn it up it gets really bright, and the subwoofer lags behind really fast. In the end it isn't an overly enjoyable listening experience. Frustrated I removed the amplifier units, replaced the subwoofer that went bad with my old unit and used the 90 degree cable with my old components. Everything back to what I consider normal.\n\nIf you purchase, I would recommend finding an old setup somewhere and replacing the blown subwoofer, which is common due to the foam surround going bad after several years.\n\nBTW I don't consider myself a hardcore audiophile but have done several years of listening to high end speakers such as Paradigm, Mirage, B&W, Energy to name a few. Klipsh bought out Mirage / Energy and are now sub par compared to when they were independently owned companies. Klipsh's cost cutting habits are fine for todays ""audio junkie"" that thinks speakers like Fluance are ""good"". For someone with finer audio tastes, I can't totally recommend the new Promedia 2.1 system, even though it is similar to other units at a similar price point.\n\nIn conclusion. They just don't make audio systems like they use to.";Firstly I would like to say

31;101.0;4.0;5.0;1252;"First off: these speakers are worth getting, imo. Great sound, good quality, and they fill the room with bass when I want to shake the room. Other techie stuff, please see below:\n\nFor those who are tech-savvy...\n\nYes, the Klipsch speakers now are built without a fuse, and without an on/off switch. Whether this is because Klipsch felt that its system was stable enough to handle a power surge without the fuse or switch, or if it was due to cutting costs to maintain the price, I have no idea. HOWEVER, I will state that the 2.1 speakers I bought mid-2014 perform flawlessly thus far.\n\nBTW: People, check Best Buy for their pricing. In my town, the speakers were sold there for $139.99 plus tax. That's significantly cheaper than buying it off Amazon, AND it's same-day delivery. Normally I'm all for buying stuff off the internet, but in this case it's worth making a five minute call to see if you can save the hassle of having your speakers bounce around in a semi truck for a couple days before you finally receive it. For once I'm glad to patronize Best Buy.\n\nI've also seen some people commenting about certain problems Klipsch is known for. I'll address some of them:\n\nRegarding blown out subwoofers: If you are thinking of buying a used Klipsch sound system, you need to know: be very careful buying this system used. The speaker in the subwoofer unit uses FOAM suspension, which means that after a while (years) the foam can get brittle and these speakers become susceptible to blowing out (this is probably influenced in part by your particular climate). This is what happened to me; I bought a 4.1 system used, and the one woofer was already blown out. The other speaker's foam suspension ripped apart at the lightest touch, and I ended up replacing both speakers.\n\nWhile the system is worth buying new, be aware that if you choose to purchase a used system, there's a solid chance that you'll eventually end up needing to repair/replace the speaker(s) in the subwoofer unit (as I had the misfortune of needing to do).\n\nHow to repair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWR2YfFzI2w\n\nI replaced mine before finding out there was an option to simply repair the woofers.

When I hooked up this Klipsch 2.1 system to my laptop listening to streaming internet music, I was blown away by the sound quality! Crisp, transparent highs, clear life-like midrange and warm bass tones with depth and zero distortion. The wattage rating is very conservative as I could not turn this system up to over 1/2 of the max volume without upsetting the neighbors. The styling of the satellite speakers and stands is very impressive to see in person. For the money, this system is amazing. And no, I don't work for Klipsch. This is the first product review I have ever written. I spend hours in front of my computer for my job and high quality background music is important to me as I work.

On searching the internet, I found out that there are many people with the same issue. Then I contacted Klipsch, who suggested that the problem could be with the amplifier and referred me to some servicing company that would charge me $75 + shipping for fixing the amplifier.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed having it connected to my computer for two years I will not think about buying klipsch product.;Does not last long!
36;86.0;1.0;6.0;1457;"I was looking to replace a set of 20yr old 2.1 speakers that still sounded great, but one speaker would stop working on occasion.  The speaker was not blown, just a wire would have to be wiggled and played with to get it going again.\n\nMusic, movies, and games all sounded great with my old speakers, yet I was hoping for even better sound and had always considered Klipsch a higher end line.  I found the Klipsch on sale for $99.99 at a local store, so I purchased them after reading many reviews, both positive and negative.\n\nFirst thing I noticed out of the box was that these things were extremely light, especially the subwoofer.  I know with electronics and advancements, that lightweight is not necessarily a bad thing, but for speakers with magnets, etc the Promedia just felt off.  My old subwoofer is about one-quarter the size, yet weighs, probably, 10 times as much as the Klipsch.  Even the satellites weighed a lot more than the  Promedia ones.\n\nThe construction on the Klipsch looked okay, but feels very cheap.  They are ""wood,"" but poor quality ""wood.""  The screens on the satellites also felt low-end.  There is no on/off switch on either the satellites or the subwoofer; not a deal breaker to me, since I leave mine on all the time, but worth noting.  Lastly, the knobs on the satellite felt weak and had way too much play.  I use the volume mixer with my computer, and with these, I think you would have to, unless you want to break it right off the speaker.\n\nBeginning to feel a bit apprehensive I hooked up the new Klipsch and kept my old set right next to them.  Hooking up is fairly simple:  Connect satellites to sub with red and black wires and connect the funky amp connection (similar to a PS/2 mouse connector).\n\nThe Klipsch satellites sounded pretty good, but the subwoofer had very little tight bass response. I played a variety of music through them to get as full of a range as possible.  Throughout every song, the satellites performed well, but the sub ruined it. I was not expecting audiophile-quality bass response, but this thing rolled and flabbed along.  Not tight and not clean.  If you want loud, booming, hanging bass, you may be okay with it.  If you are looking for decent, somewhat tight and clean response, then this will disappoint.\n\nFlipping back and forth with the same songs through both the Promedia and my ancient speakers the Klipsch satellites were a bit better, but the subwoofer could not make a scratch. I paid about $75 for mine way back, so I had hoped the Promedia would have been, at least, on par.  After all, I bought the Klipsch to be an upgrade.\n\nHaving read that new speakers sometimes take a little bit to be optimal, I continued using both for a little over a week.  Both were never turned off and kept on during this period. The Promedia never got any better.  The satellites were decent sounding, but the sub was just ruining it.\n\nThe Promedia 2.1 set has been sold for about 10 years.  Maybe five years ago these things were near the top, but not now.  They may look the same, and have the same name, but the materials, the construction, and the quality appears to be quite different.  I have my doubts that the current Promedia would last a year, so I returned them.\n\nIf you are looking for a mid- to high-end speaker set, then this is not it. I am giving this product 1 star, because, while it sounds decent, everything else about it leans heavily towards basic low-end. If they were between $50 and $70 dollars, I would rate them higher.  However, seeing as they are expensive and supposed to be mid-high end, they fall far short.  In my opinion, Klipsch should be embarrassed to have their name on this speaker set.";Maybe great a few years ago

40;60.0;1.0;9.0;1496;"This review comes from someone who has a 10 something year old version of these. The sub gave up the ghost awhile back, maybe a year ago, but the satellites still rocked. Decided I wanted to get some low end thump back and picked up another set last week.\n\nBoy what a difference in quality of sound. The sub still brings it but the satellites just flat out suck. No amount of break in is going to alleviate the drop off in sound quality (though I'm going to give them a few more days before dealing with the after Christmas crowd). None. For folks that don't know what these used to bring to the table and find the sound adequate you don't know what you are missing. These puppies used to rock.

41;109.0;1.0;5.0;1499;I've had these speakers for a few years.  They sound absolutely great... excellent highs, plenty of bass, and TONS of volume.  Unfortunately, a few months back I noticed that one of my speakers had started cutting out.  I crawled under the desk today to check the connections, and when I tugged on one of the speaker wires, it came right out.  I went to push the little spring-loaded lever on the connector and with very very little pressure it bent in half and then fell apart.  Please note that there was never any strain on the connector.  This thing has been sitting under my desk completely untouched for a couple of years, and has only ever been unhooked once since I bought the speakers.\n\nI would expect a little more durability out of components put into a set of computer speakers that I paid over a hundred-and-a-half for.

42;38.0;3.0;14.0;1639;"This has been in production since 2001. That's a long time. And the ProMedia series has been highly acclaimed ever since for its full and limber bass response and it's satellites flat response.\nHowever, in 2011 the series was redesigned with a ""digital hybrid"" power supply. They went from Klipsch-designed discrete amps to a cheap chip based a/b system.\nThis has many subwoofer-based problems for the end consumer:\n\n-Although it still has a discrete MOSFET amp output section, the cheap digital a/b preamp butchers the signal from the get-go. The result is that there is not enough clean preamp signal to move the voice coil well enough (due to muddy low level artifacts) and the result is an unmistakable muddy-ing of bass attacks, turning, say, a 1/16 note bass drum blast into an indistinguishable rumble\n-also due to the processing inadequacies of the digital side, there is a constant low level harmonic distortion, turning the accompanying bass guitar rhythm into a noteless muddy mess. When you can hear a clear note, its usually a harmonic variant (not cool).\n-The amp had been reported by many people to burn out quickly due to a lack of heat dispersion on the part of whoever designed it.\n\nThe satellites still sound fantastic, however. But the subwoofer won't sound anything like the original that had been around for ~90% of the series lifespan.\n\nI think that a brief burn in period would help the subwoofer a bit, but that still doesn't solve the problem of the amp burning out. I'd keep the woofer volume as low as I could and turn it off completely for a spell of I smelled burning. Unfortunately, keeping the system volume higher, I've found, helps the muddy bass to tighten up a bit. So its a catch 22 -_-"".\n\nFortunately, even with this issue, these speakers are still a very worthy contender if you want a quality system with a flat frequency response, detailed mids and highs, and good (hopefully better with burn in) bass.\n\nUPDATE: 8/17/13\n\nThese speakers have performed well. The bass has tightened up to a degree, but there is still harmonic distortion.\nMy conclusion: With burn in, the driver will loosen up enough for the subwoofer to attack with more accuracy, but overall the subwoofer is still a mild disappointment.

43;111.0;5.0;5.0;1671;"I'm a big fuss when it comes to sound quality and the requirements of my musical items. In my spare time I write and record music and as a guitarist, I spend lots of time around tube amplification and speakers, so I generally know my way around sound. I wouldn't go as far as to call myself an audiophile, but I am the only one of my friends who gets annoyed by low bitrate tracks. My daily driver headphones are a set of Klipsch Image S4's and my home headphones are a pair of AKG K242-HD's, so I'm referencing those with regards to sound quality. Here it goes!\n\nBuild Quality:\nThe overall feel of the satellites is pretty much what I expected. They are plastic enclosures, though the plastic is a nicer quality, and the grilles are nicely made (no fraying, stitching showing, etc.). The legs are made of metal and feel very sturdy, though one of them (the right satellite) wasn't sitting flush to my table, which required me to bend the left leg a little. Not a big deal at all, and it was mostly me being a stickler, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Oh, and it comes with a little baggie of rubber adhesive feet that you can apply to the bottom of the satellites so they don't move and sit on a base that won't reverberate their sound through a desk. These are an absolute pain. I ruined two of them by pulling off the adhesive along with the sticker. You really have to get your thumb in between it or else you'll ruin it. Be careful! Not a big deal though, because they give you 12 when you only need 8 in total (4 for each satellite). Overall though, the construction is solid. Wood satellites would've been cool, but at this price range, that's asking a lot. The sub is nicely built from what I can tell. A nice finish with proper speaker wire for the satellites and not some proprietary connector. A nice touch, as it'll be easy to replace if need be and who knows, maybe you can use different satellites, though I wouldn't mess with it. The only downside build wise is the lack of a power switch on the system. That's right, short of unplugging it, you can't turn it off. Oh well. Apparently Klipsch states that it was designed this way, but knowing that many owners of these have had the amp in the unit fail, it's still concerning, though I won't make that an issue unless mine decided to eventually fail, in which case I will edit this review.\n\nSound Quality:\nSo here's where it matters. Honestly, the looks of a system mean little to me if it sounds like garbage, but like almost every Klipsch product I've encountered, the sound quality is sublime for its price. Like my set of Image S4 headphones, these ProMedia speakers are the best sounding 2.1 multimedia speakers in the price range that they are. The competing Logitech Z623's, while a solid system, are blown away here. While they are just as powerful at 200 watts, they lack certain aspects of the Klipsch set that makes them a less worthy system in my opinion. I'll break down the Klipsch set comparatively as follows:\n\nHighs:\nThe high end range of these speakers is greatly enhanced over most other multimedia and 2.1 speaker systems in this range through the utilization of a 3/4"" horn tweeter as well as the larger midrange driver in the satellite. Most systems, such as the competing Logitech Z623 in this price range, have satellites with only a midrange driver. This addition on Klipsch's end allows for more shimmering highs and a cleaner sound stage with a much more defined tonality.\n\nMids:\nThe midrange on these speakers is excellent. The high mids blend perfectly due to the addition of the tweeters, which let the midrange speakers focus on what they need to (the midrange) and not try to compensate. This allows a more airy and open soundstage for the satellites as a whole. Any lack of midrange bite that these may have is easily dialed out with proper EQ'ing on your PC.\n\nLows:\nAh, the lows. They're definitely there, and while they may not be as powerful as the Logitech system, I found that they are more accurate and better accentuated. If you're really just trying to find a system to do low end thump or you're just trying to blast your dubstep as hard as you can at a party, this isn't your system. Don't get me wrong, there's quite the bass on tap, and I crank dubstep on them occasionally, but it's not going to be insane. The knob for the subwoofer adjustment is also not as linear as I had hoped, at least at normal listening levels. For example, if considering the knob as a scale from 1 to 10, the bass level when set at 10 is not double what it is at 5. The bass intensity seems to peak at roughly 1 o'clock on the knob and everything after that seems to do less and less. Still, that's more bass than I would want anyway, and to be honest, it begins to distort unfavorably, but that's expected of any audio with it's parameters maxed. I have my subwoofer control set at roughly 10 o'clock. I find this is more than ample. The bass itself is very articulate as well. I listen to a lot of metal, and with many other systems, quick double bass often turns itself into one muddled sound without differentiation. In this regard, the Klipsch system is very good. It's not perfect and it can get muddy with certain things, but it's leaps and bounds better than the subs offered in comparable systems at this price. The range on the sub is also very good. Bass notes in very low registers aren't lost, though a move to an 8"" sub would have made things even better. Still, at this price, who can complain.\n\nOverall Soundstage:\nThe overall presence of these speakers is incredible. There's a 3D depth to music listened through these that not many other systems have and music really tends to pop through them. There's a much more organic presence in this set of speakers than many of the other I had looked at and listened to. They're definitely the best in the price range with regards to accuracy. They're also very low noise. There's almost no hum from the speakers and no audible buzzing from idle when sound is not being played through them. With that regard I was very impressed. Outside the realm of music, things are wonderful, though honestly not as great as with music. Watching film is a joy, but the same articulate nature of the subwoofer gained from reduced output shows itself here. While the aspects of the sub that make it good for music, such as articulate rather than powerful bass, can help it in film (where they whirring of helicopter blades individual come through much better than on the more powerful and more muddy subwoofers of competitive speaker systems), the lack of what seems to be sheer bass power hurts slightly. Rumbling explosions feel excellent, but not overwhelmingly exhilarating like they do on the Logitech Z623 for example. If you're looking for the biggest bass you can get regardless of accuracy, or if you primarily watching film with these speakers, you might be a little happier elsewhere, but as far as a whole soundstage package goes (taking into account movie AND music listening), you can't do any better than these. For me, I'd much rather take bass accuracy than abundance. Quality over quantity is the name of the game with these speakers, and they don't disappoint in that regard.\n\nSome Issues:\nThe only issue I have with the subwoofer, and in all honesty, the system itself, is it's inability to fill in the small gap that is the low-mid frequency range. There's a tiny, albeit present, acoustic gap in that frequency range which ever so slightly accentuates the disconnect between the satellites and the subwoofer. What I mean by this is that, occasionally, the satellites sound separate from the subwoofer, almost as if there is a missing part of the system that should be there to reproduce certain sounds. In all honesty, I can't fault the system for this. This is an issue with all 2.1 multimedia sets. A large sub and relatively small satellites in comparison generally causes something to be missing; in this case a speaker in between the subwoofer's size and the satellite's midrange driver to take care of the frequency. That said, it's a very small range that would require a whole new speaker orientation and design to take care of, so it's not a big deal it isn't there. Like I said, it's just the nature of 2.1 systems in general, but this is a sound review, so I might as well mention it.\n\nAnother small issue that arose was some crackling in the midrange drivers of the satellites upon first using these speakers. There was a faint yet audible buzzing of the drivers which, to be honest, upset me a bit. It ruined the tonality of a lot of songs and it kind of distracted me from the music. Luckily though, the more the speakers were broken in, the more it faded, and it's, as far as I can tell now, gone, at least in normal listening conditions without isolating the speaker through EQ'ing and turning off the sub. As of now though, I'm going to chalk it up to normal noise from speakers that are simply un-played and need to be broken in, but it's worth mentioning, as a new unit may show these signs and might be alarming or annoying to first time listeners.\n\nConclusions:\nThese are without a doubt the best 2.1 computer speakers you can buy. Their long track record proves that. The addition of tweeters in the satellites is a wonderful boost to the liveliness of the soundstage and the focus on an accurate rather than boomy subwoofer is excellent for those who demand an accurate reproduction of their music rather than a colored soundscape. Of course, these aren't going to beat a set of nice bookshelf speakers and they certainly aren't as accurate, but for a 2.1 system at this price range, you can't do any better in my book. Though there are questionable aspects of their long term reliability (you can't even turn them off short of unplugging them, which is even worse for the amp, coupled with the fact that there are a good number of people complaining about the amp blowing out on theres), mine work perfectly, and show no signs that they might break down in the near future, so taking points off for that reason wouldn't be fair. Can you get better sound? Of course. Can you get better sound at this price? I really don't know if you can, other than going used and hunting down an amplifier and a pair of good bookshelf speakers, but then you're missing the point. 2.1's are easy and simple solutions for those who don't want to deal with amps, large speaker enclosures, and dedicated systems. With that in mind, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 is, at least to me, your best bet at their price, and they're certainly the best sounding 2.1 multimedia speakers I have had the pleasure of using.";The Best 2.1 System for the Price
44;18.0;1.0;38.0;1900;Initially impressed by the good reviews, I bought these without much research. Unfortunately, when I listened to them I wasn't impressed at all. They sounded WORSE than the Logitech's they were replacing. Confused, I did some more research and I discovered that they were completely redesigned. The sub lost 5 pounds. Basically, Klipsch 2.1 speakers USED to be good, but now they're not good at all. I would avoid them, or at least do some more research (in which case you'll avoid them). Here are my initial impressions\n\n* The bass is very punchy. It's strong, but completely distorts low frequencies. I have trouble hearing some MAIN instruments in songs, when I can clearly hear them on headphones. That being said, I thought the mids and highs were clear. Overall though, I thought the music sounded empty\n\n* The warranty for this product looks terrible. Basically, these speakers fail all the time, and Klipsch appears to have the worst customer service in the world. If you do any research, you'll be scared. Everyone has the same part failing in 1-2 years. Clearly these were not designed to last\n\nAnyway, if you're looking at alternatives, I think Logitech Z623 might be good. I've also read really good things about M-Audio BX5a Deluxe (best reviewed in its class) and for slightly more money, AudioEngine A5. However, I haven't decided on any of these, as I had Logitech Z2300 and I don't want to downgrade.;Don't buy
45;10.0;1.0;49.0;1920;I don't review often but felt I had to warn potential buyers about the new Pro media 2.1 speaker system. I'll start buy saying they sound great,I purchased these to replace my old Pro media 2.1 speakers that lasted 4 years of constant use and performed flawlessly. I was a little surprised when I took them out of the box to set them up and noticed right off,that the sub-woofer weighed half of the weight of my old set,there was no on/off switch and no fuse in the back of the unit,it just seemed it was made a lot cheaper. The sound was still great,so I figured I'd give the a shot,I bought them in July 2012 and yesterday they started making crackling popping sounds and then just quit all together, nothing. I guess Klipsch has gone the Chinese garbage route and sold out to cheap manufacturing,shame on me for not getting the warranty from best buy so I could just return it for another one, i got such good use of the last system I didn't think I'd need it. So now I will see if it is cost effective to pay for shipping and return shipping or just suck it up and lesson learned. I guess my point is ,if you feel the need to buy this system,GET THE WARRANTY.;Klipsch disappointment
46;68.0;2.0;9.0;1920;So I really love these speakers.  I've bought 3 sets of them.\n\nThe speakers are excellent with good sound throughout.  The problem is that both the headphone jack and the subwoofer jack are of very poor quality.  They will fail *far* before the otherwise great speakers.  I don't move my speakers around, they sit in one spot.  Yet somehow the jacks still manage to fail.\n\nI probably won't ever buy another set as I'm tired of getting rid of otherwise good speakers because the $5 jack failed.\n\n5 stars for sound Quality.  1 star for Equipment Quality.;Great speakers, bad jacks.
47;40.0;1.0;15.0;1924;These were by far the best computer speakers I have ever owned.\n\nHowever last night the left channel started to crackle, buzz, and pop.  Then it died.  A strong burning smell coming from the left speaker filled the room.\n\nI did a quick Google search, and I am not the only person to have this problem.  Repair costs start at $75 plus shipping both ways, and local repair shops say it's not worth the fix.  Unfortunately they are going in the trash tonight.\n\nWhile these speakers produced amazing sound quality, I cannot recommend purchasing them unless you plan on purchasing another set on a regular basis.;Does not last
48;84.0;1.0;7.0;1976;I loved the sound of my ProMedia 2.1 enough that I bought a second set for another location to play iTunes. Well, now the left channel has gone out on both sets. The speakers themselves all work so I bought a replacement preamp control cord unit but that didn't solve the problem. Still no sound out of the left speakers.\n\nKlipsch Support said I probably need to replace the amps - 80+ dollars each - but that it was an unusual problem . I said there were loads of complaints online about the left speaker going dead and he responded that there were no such problems. He said these online complainers are loopy (his words exactly). I guess the Klipsch strategy is repeat how great you are and deny any problems.\n\nCall me loopy but they certainly will never get my money again.;Good Sound, Terrible Quality
49;117.0;5.0;5.0;2044;"When I first began looking for a replacement for my introductory-level computer speaker system (CA 3602), I was unsure of what to buy, but I knew I wanted something that I would never want to replace.  After almost two months of research, I had narrowed the entire market down to three systems, from three reputable companies; the Corsair SP2500, the Klipsch Promedia 2.1, and the Logitech Z623.  I will guess that anyone reading this review will have also come to the same, or a similar final list of choices.  If not, I will highly suggest starting from this point, as it will likely save you a lot of time.\n\n  The first system that I cut out was the Corsair SP 2500, for one simple reason; it's subwoofer is massive, and I did not have anywhere to place it in my office where my cats could not defile it.  However, from the research I did, I found that the audio and build quality of the SP 2500 is equivalent to the Promedia's, but the SP 2500 maintains lower THD (total harmonic distortion) at it's maximum volume.  However, it's bass may by a bit ""boomy"".\n\n  The second to go was the Logitech Z623.  This was a much harder decision to make, as I read glowing reviews of both systems, and even side-by-side comparisons ended on personal preference.  Latter in the two months I finally found a purely unbiased site on which a comparison was being drawn.  On this site, it was almost unanimously decided that the Z623's subwoofer was somewhat muddy and inaccurate when compared to the Promedia's, and thus the Z623 was eliminated from my list of choices leaving only one.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Thus far, I could not be more impressed with my Klipsch Promedia 2.1s.  Their treble is crisp and clear, but not overly sharp (a common trait of Klipsch systems).  Their midrange reproduction is rich and accurate.  The bass is tight and powerful.  They will go far louder than I require (I have never turned them up past 30% volume).  I use them to listen to pretty much everything (dubstep, orchestral, classical, trance, house, drum and bass, metal, and classic rock), and they are simply outstanding.\n\n  I am also a gamer (Skyrim, Battlefield 3, Call of Duty MW3, League of Legends), and I can hear the clash of every sword, and the crack of every gunshot like what was not possible with my previous speakers.  I can feel the rumble of the tank's engine, the collapse of every building, and the thunderous cry of a dragon flying overhead.\n\n  Klipsch has been making this same set of speakers since the year 2000.  If this is not a hint at their amazing build and audio quality, I don't know what is.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  After using this system for a few months now, I have found 4 small things to complain about (and most of their solutions), all of which are related to the subwoofer:\n\n>Problem:  At higher volumes + higher bass settings, the sub driver's cone will actually hit the protective grill.\n>Solution:  Using a flat bladed screwdriver (or that little fold-out thingy on a pair of fingernail clippers), you can CAREFULLY pry out the grill.  Setting it back in place, but not pushing it all the way in, will give the driver an extra ~3/32 of an inch of headroom.\n\n>Problem:  The panel on the side of the subwoofer (the amplifier's heatsink) gets EXTREMELY hot if the system's volume it turned up for long durations.\n>Solution:  Well, I'm a tech nerd, so I naturally have old Computer components laying here and there.  I grabbed an old, flat-bottomed aluminum CPU cooler, and cleaned the old thermal paste off.  I then applied new thermal paste to the center part of the heatsink, put dots of superglue around the edges, and stuck it on the side of the subwoofer, just above the satellite plugins (the hottest spot on the side panel).  I have not had heat issues since.\n\n>Problem:  At very high bass volumes, the sub can travel an ever-so-slight amount.\n>Solution:  Old college textbooks now have a use (set them on top... *derpface*).\n\nAlso, I have to note that the sub's crossover frequency should have been 10hz or 15hz lower, as there is an extremely narrow range over which audibly directional sound (which should be played by the satellites) can be traced back to the sub.\n\nUPDATE ----- 11/24/12 -----\n\nI have recently upgraded the default satellite speakers to a set of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dual-LU43PB-Indoor-Outdoor-Speakers/dp/B00081NX5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dual LU43PB Indoor/Outdoor Speakers</a>.  To my ears, this was a vast improvement over the defaults.  The Duals have a much broader range, especially in the midrange and midbass.  At the same time, the tweeters are not so overpowering.  Vocals sound MUCH more natural now.  My experience while watching the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was definitely more um...THXier than with the stock set.  The issue I listed above about the sub's crossover frequency has been virtually eliminated since the satellites now play more midbass / upper bass.  I highly suggest this upgrade to any and all owners of the Klipsch Promedia 2.1s.\n\nAlso, there is another spot on the subwoofer that get exceedingly hot during prolonged use; it is the area above the control pod plugin on the sub.  I bought 3 sets of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/these-Xbox-mini-heatsinks/dp/B005CTPKAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">these Xbox mini-heatsinks</a>, and applied them to the hotspot.  It barely even gets warm to the touch now.";Outstanding
50;75.0;1.0;8.0;2102;I am on my second set of these speakers now.  They sound great when they work but after two failed sets I give up.  On my first set the amp failed and just continually blew fuses as soon as it was turned on.  On the second set my left channel has gone out for some reason.  Replacing the fuse for that channel does nothing, something must be fried on the board itself.\n\nAvoid if you want a set of speakers that will last for a while.;Great... when they work
51;9.0;3.0;55.0;2127;This speaker set sounds great don't get me wrong. BUT... there is one HUGE flaw in the design that they have not sorted out after all of these years. The DIN Plug. Once this goes bad your entire nice system is utter trash. What sounded great is now dead because of one input to the sub that powers the entire unit aside from the AC. Wiggling the cable to try to get it in the perfect spot to get sound. Because of this issue I have decided not to purchase another set. All you have to do is google it. This is a known issue... FOR A LONG TIME.;Owned them for a long time DIN Plug Flaw
52;91.0;5.0;7.0;2156;Very happy with these.  I bought a new TV and the sound was tinny and hard to hear.  I looked at Logitech 506 for\nsurround sound, but there was no way to directly plug into my new set's optical output.\nI really didn't want to buy a separate receiver, and I already had a blueray so I didn't\nwant to get one of the home theatre combo sets.  Plus if you go that route you end up\nwith a stack of remote controls and a complicated setup.  I've got kids and wife all using\nthis set and they want to be able to just pick up the TV remote and turn it on.\n\nSo I decided to forego surround sound and go with plain old stereo.  I think it was a good call.\nI wanted bass and volume and these do a great job, just plug them into the TV headphone jack.  No additional\namplifier is needed and the TV remote controls the volume.  You don't need an additional remote that way.\nThey really have the power to fill the room with sound, and have knobs on one speaker to separately control the bass\nand adjust the volume, so you can tweak how loud it is with the TV remote control.;Works great as TV speakers, just not surround sound
53;3.0;5.0;394.0;2225;"I know there are a lot of reviews on the Promedia 2.1's which is great that Klipsch is finally getting a little recognition from the public, the down side is that most of the reviews are people coming from laptop speakers or the generic crap that came with their dell tower...\n\nIve been in professional audio for more than fifteen years both home and mobile audio, so It takes a lot to impress me. The Pro Media 2.1's did impress me, for the price. Can you compare these to top end Home Audio setup? Even though many do, the answer is no you cannot. As far as computer speakers go (non recording quality) these really are about as good as it gets at this price point. You could get a better system if your willing to drop $4-500+ but compared to other ""commom consumer"" products are concered Klipsh has always been a leader in SQ and very underrated at that. Keep in mind we are talking about consumer shelf products here, soon as you take a step up into the Audiophile world your taking a huge step up in price.\n\nSo now the good bad and ugly...\n\nSound Quality 8+\n\nAgain for the price these are well balanced and Klipsh seems to be one of the very few putting out consumer items that has an understanding of how audio is actually put together. They seem to focus on whats sounds proper rather than what looks cool. Remember what happened to Harman Kardon?? Yep they are still producing the clear see through computer speakers. Bose is still Bose... They have a few solid products but pretty much have been on cruise control for the past decade based soley on a name and reputation built in the 80s-90s. Anyway back to the ProMedia's, well balanced and highs are bright but not overwhelming especailly coming from Horn tweets. Satellite speakers have a proper mid range driver and seperate tweeter, instead of looking ""modern"" with some crazy design Klipsh built the design around what a proper speaker needs to sound good. To some that equals an ugly system, To me it just equals a proper system. Bass it tight and response is accurate.\n\nBass 9\n\nBass is very good on the pro media's. Its the kind of bass thats perfect for obnoxious teenages who want to drive thier parents nuts. In other words there is a whole lot of it to go around, so much so it NEEDS to be dialed WAY down just to keep the sound quality high. Persoanlly I find its best run at about 15-20% without the need to Ever go over 50%. Basically what this means is that Klipsh went a little overboard with marketing to a generation of gamers and obnoxious teenages who think the 30 to 60 hz range needs to be set on permanent +24db. This is the only reason I didn't rate the Pro Media 2.1 a 10 for bass, the good news is that those of us who want a balanced flat response range can turn the knob way down and get it :)\n\nOutput 10\n\nWere talking pure Db's now!  However keep in mind my ratings are based on expectations and competitors in for this price range ($100-200). Very big sound from such a small setup, these should satisfy most of us who don't enjoy bleeding ears from small room setups. Gets rather lound with minimal distortion if your Eq'ed properly, would be very easy to clip the subwoofer if you didn't know how to set your bass properly for high volumes. I read a few reviews that said the bass sucked because it distored, if your able to distort the sub on this system THAT easily you either don't have a clue about setup or need to forget buying computer speakers altogether and get yourself a small stage PA system... Simply Put the Pro Media 2.1 gets louder than any other computer system Ive demo'ed to date.\n\nNow for a few flaws... Yes every good thing has its flaws :)\n\n-Design might be an issue for some people, not the most atractive desktop setup, if thats what your after.\n\n-No power switch, System stays on all the time, so do not forget to turn your volume knob all the way down when your done. Otherwise you run the risk of blowing your spouse or animals through the wall if your out for a midnight internet surf and forgot you left the volume at 60%...\n\n-Not that the speakers are ""unbalanced"" but at low volume levels the current is not high enough to power the left satellite to the same volume level as the right side. The trick to help this is to lower your preamp output and increase the speaker amp output.\n\nOverall I would rate the system 9+ based on its value. Its not High end audio but in the world of computer geeks and casual listeners, is prob the best there is.";Honest Review from an Audiophile
54;34.0;3.0;19.0;2254;First and foremost, please note that these speakers have changed since they were first introduced. This review is more of a comparison between the old set which I originally purchased in 2004 and that now has a flaky DIN input plug (huge known issue with the older model) and this new set that was purchased in November 2011.\n\nNotable differences:\n1) The notorious DIN plug was changed so it doesn't stick straight out of the subwoofer, potentially resulting in less failures. This is probably the biggest plus of the new set.\n\n2) The wires on the satellite speakers are now hardwired instead of being connected via 3.5mm plugs. This is a drawback for those who wanted to use higher gauge wires for the speakers to (potentially) increase sound quality, HOWEVER, it also fixed the issue of the plugs producing static if moved, even if the movement was the result of sound playing from the speaker(s)! With the old set, I found myself sometimes moving the plugs around to prevent dropouts\static, and now this issue is resolved.\n\n3) In comparison with the old subwoofer, the new one definitely sounds boomy and less deep in sound. This could be due to not having a break-in period, but it was definitely an issue as I was no longer pleased with the bass being produced. I could no longer get the subwoofer to seamlessly blend between the satellites and the subwoofer as the boomy-ness always made it apparent that the bass was coming from under my desk. This was NOT an issue with the old model, ever.\nAs a side note and possibly the cause of this, the subwoofer is now 5.5 pounds lighter than the older one.\n\n4) There is no longer a power switch on the subwoofer so you can't turn them off without unplugging them from the outlet. Not a huge deal as idle power draw is low, but this might be annoying for those with power consumption concerns.\n\nAll in all, I decided not to keep the new set. It seems like they cut every corner in this newer model, and while that had a pro or two, the overall result is a lower quality product at the same price point. I'll be looking at the Logitech Z623's now as I have always been impressed with Logitech build quality AND warranty support, something I can't say about Klipsch, who want to nickel and dime you for replacements, even when it's a known issue.;Old set vs New set
55;42.0;2.0;16.0;2352;"I purchased a new set of ProMedia 2.1 speakers to replace a set that failed (power supply blows fuses) after about 5-years of service. Tried contacting Klipsch customer service, but there was no reply to my inquiry .\n\nI'm not new to the Klipsch brand. I have 2 pair of Heritage speakers - LaScala's (front channel) and Heresy's (back channel) - both from the 1970's. Not to mention a pair of Kg 0.5's and Klipsch Image One headphones.\n\nThere are significant differences between the old (ProMedia 2.1v1) and the new (ProMedia 2.1v2). The specs on the Klipsch website ([...]) continue to reflect the 2.1v1 system. Specs for the 2.1v2 seem to be hard to come by. Most online reviews just regurgitate the Klipsch website specs.\n\nThe 2.1v2 manual that came with the system states the subwoofer is ""...rear port and front-firing 8"" long-throw driver..."" but the system incorporates the same 6.5"" side-firing, front port design as the 2.1v1. The subwoofer cabinet couldn't physically accommodate an 8"" driver.\n\nEvery corner that could be cut has been cut in the 2.1v2, right down to the length of the power cord. There is no power switch, no external fuse, the satellites are hard wired where the use to have mini-plugs. The 2.1v2 subwoofer enclosure weighs a full 6 lbs. less than the 2.1v1, 11.25 lbs vs 17.25 lbs.\n\nWhile I can not make a direct comparison between the 2 systems, my subjective evaluation is that the 2.1v2 is pretty gutless compared to the old 2.1v1. The bass is just not there like it was in the 2.1v1. I think it is safe to say that it is no longer a 200-watt (total) system. I'm not completely dissatisfied with the 2.1v2 system, but more disappointed in the poor quality from a name I thought I could trust.\n\nThis is a disposable system. Don't expect to last a life time as you would most speaker systems. It's just not built to last - It's built to fail.\n\nI've gotten much more service from Cambridge Soundworks systems. When this ProMedia system fails, and I'm sure it will from what I read, I'm replacing it with a Cambridge system. Probably should have sent these back and purchased a MicroWorks or Model 10 system.\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Klipsch-ProMedia-2-1-THX-Certified-Computer-Speaker-System-Black/dp/B000062VUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)</a>";Poor Quality from Trusted Brand
56;98.0;3.0;7.0;2366;"I purchased this speaker system about 3 years ago, and it has been a constant love/hate relationship. There are so many pro's and con's for these speakers. I'm not gonna go into all of them, just the ones I considered to be most relevant in my uses:\nThe pro's include:\n-amazing sound quality and range. I love feeling the rumble, and with this sub, I rarely turned the tone knob above about a third for a movie and maybe halfway or so for some hard trance, metal, rock, and even some older rap. The mids were clean and clear. So clear that I could hear someone coughing in a live recording of Mannheim Steamroller.  And the highs? Unreal! You can put in some old big band jazz, like Maynard Ferguson, and there is almost no distortion to the screaming trumpet.  No matter if I was watching a movie via my laptop, jamming to pandora through my phone, or using an old sony walkman, the sound was always superb.\n-very strong design. Considering the ""made in China"" sticker, I am amazed that I only just managed to destroy this system. But in a way, this was also a downfall in my opinion. More on that in a minute.\n-Small footprint. I originally purchased these to install int he sleeper of my Kenworth W900L. A semi notorious for having one of the smallest and tightest living quarters in the industry. The component speakers are perfect for either hard mounting on a wall, or using the permanently mounted feet. If you use them on the desktop, the foot design makes it easy to keep a tape or paperclip dispenser on them. The sub also has a fairly small footprint, and since it is ported and side facing, there are very few limitations on where you can set it.\n-On one of the satellites, there are stereo jacks for both an extra audio input device, and an output jack for headphones.\n-Volume and tone controls are very simple, and very sensitive. The included amplifier definitely does what it is intended for!\n\nAnd the cons:\n-As stated earlier, this is built quite well. So much so that if there is even a small problem, you cannot fix it but must replace the entire get-up. A lightning bolt fried my surge protector, and managed to do damage to the power module of the amp. Because of this, all three speakers are useless now. The amp is coated with a layer of melted glues making it impossible to even remove a chip for any kind of inspection.\n-the wiring is very poorly designed in many ways.  First, you have to run the obvious power and speaker cables. No problem, right? this system adds in another wire, which in my opinion, is the weak link of this whole package. You must run an extra wire from the primary satellite speaker to the sub, alongside the normal speaker wire. This extra wire is the control tether for the volume and tone controls, nothing more. And when plugged in, it pushes the sub enclosure a few inches out, for fear of crimping the wires. The jack for this wire is also very temperamental. After a few days of use, I would have to sit there and wiggle the wire to get the circuits to close.\n-The power switch location sucks! The toggle is located near the bottom, back side of the sub. This means that you need to be very nimble if you want to put the box out of sight. The switch is also located right by the above noted temperamental wire, so bumping it out of place when turning on the speakers can be more than a mild annoyance.\n\nSo, with these things considered, would I buy them again? Probably not this particular design. While I absolutely love the sound quality, I think that the wiring issue and the fact that you cannot do any sort of upkeep is a really big fault. I hate having 3 speakers here that all sound great, but I can't use because of one little circuit board getting fried. I hate having to go out and buy a whole new system because of this. So, for a home entertainment system, in a house I plan on dieing in, I would definitely consider installing a plethora of Klipsch components and speakers. But for anything less, i doubt I will.";On the fence.

I'm a former electronic technician and had the right tools, including magnetic wand, tweezers, assorted screw drivers, and safety goggles - plus I didn't want to go through the hassle of return shipping and waiting several weeks.  After several attempts I was able to put one spring back, but then the second one fell into the assembly.  I then had to take the back off the system (it's glued in addition to screws).  I had to cut the black sponge of the snap on assembly to retrieve the screw that had gotten stuck.  I was then able to place the second screw and re-assemble the back plate.  Even once re-assembled, I inspected the speaker wire clips, and found them to be poorly designed and very poor at attaching the speaker wires.  I found only one other review with a 'spring' loss related to the wire clips.  Very surprising to me given how cheap and poorly designed they seem on my pair of speakers.  I can't help but wonder if the company has fixed this on newer releases.  A shame if not, since otherwise I'm quite happy.  However tonight, I came close to just throwing them into the recycle chute and swearing off this brand forever.  Although they are 4-stars in all categories except construction quality, it's the construction quality that is a complete fail or pass for the rest of the system.  If you haven't yet had this problem, I'd suggest using caution when attaching or detaching the speaker wires from the unit.;Design flaw - would not buy again until fixed
59;128.0;5.0;5.0;2546;"The Promedia 2.1 by Klipsch, out since 2002, are still selling strong, and are still one of the best computer speakers you can by.  The Klipsch Promedia 2.1 are worth every penny and I love them a lot.  Be aware that these CANNOT compare to expensive audio equipment (or mid priced audio equipment from a company like HSU, if you want to compare sub woofers).  Also, these speakers, because of the satellites, may not be the best if you listen to classical or jazz.  That said, I haven't been more impressed with computer speakers than these ones, and for the money and the purpose, there's little competition out there.\n\nFirst, I do have some reservations.  First off, one thing you might want to be aware of is the so-called shoddy build quality.  I haven't had any trouble with them yet, but The Promedia 2.1, like some other Klipsch products, have had more trouble with their build quality.  I'm not sure what the ratio between well working units and defective units is, but be aware of this before you buy them (note that I don't mean the people who physically damaged them because they don't know how to handle equipment), as there have been some complaints regarding this problem.\n\nAnother thing I recommend for listeners of Acoustic, Jazz, and Classical is to research a bit into affordable studio monitors and compare, as you might find those to be much better to your listening needs.  A good example that has got plenty of good marks would be the M-Audio AV 40 Studio Monitors.  While they can't handle lower frequencies (The frequency range, according the manufactures, is 85Hz - 20,000 kHz), they are much more dedicated to better highs and mids.  They do have at least some bass, so it won't sound too tinny, either; a perfect amount for lighter music.  I'm not going to say they will always sound BETTER, as you need to listen yourself and let your own ears decide, but I personally think that Studio Monitors sounded much better with my jazz and classical records (I own both), so that's my advice to listeners of mainly these (and similar) genres.\n\nThat said, my main type of music is high octane rock, and If I had a choice, I would take these any day over a pair of studio monitors.  DON'T EVEN THINK that subwoofers are not made for music, because there is tons of music out there that would sound like total crap without those low frequencies. The limited bass of a studio monitor make bands like Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age sound laughable.  Where would awesome heavy metal like Mastodon be without the subwoofer?  Indeed, if you mainly listen to hard rock, rap, heavy metal, or the like, I would not even recommend a pair of studio monitors.  I've tried both, and trust me, listening to Soundgarden, Mastodon, Deltron 3030, Queens of the Stone Age, Rage Against the Machine, etc. without a subwoofer is like owning a Ferrari with only two transmissions on it.  So yes, this system is made for music, but it all depends on what you listen to.\n\nThese speakers for the price are simply a dream for my computer listening.  Powerful for it's size, and enough to easily fill and office room with music, the volume on these are enough to rattle the windows with ease.  Plus, when you listen to the music rather than the speaker, .  And yes, while the studio monitors have better mids and highs than the satellites for these, these ones don't slouch on that either, at least to my ears.  It's true they have a sort of ""bright"" sound to it, but I think this makes it much better for certain sounds. The high notes on the guitars sound nice and sharp, clear and bright.  Some people may not like them, but I love them.  The mid-range is nice enough to provide enough backbone to the those bright highs, and the bass itself, while can't compete with a stand alone, is perfect for it's size and never feels underpowered.  For the price, you just feel that you are getting all the satisfaction you would expect.\n\nFeature wise, there's not too much here, but for what it's worth, it's pretty easy to set up.  In addition, like other computer speakers with simple headphone jack output, you can use anything you please that has a headphone jack, from your computer to your PSP to your cheap TV, well, to anything with headphone jack.  The headphone jack used to plug in your headphones here is useful because you can actually adjust the volume and amount of bass through the speaker system, which means that you definitely are able to adjust the amount of bass.\n\nIf you are looking for well-priced computers speakers, I can't recommend these enough, as they are easily one of the best computer speakers sets around.  Whether or not you need a Sub woofer is up to you, but if you do, then these are on the short list of computer speakers worth every penny.";For Affordable, Great Computer Sound, Little else Can Compete
60;129.0;1.0;5.0;2558;"Anyone who rates these Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 speakers high likely has not had them for very long.\n\nTHE GOOD: For the purpose of being computer speakers, these were initially what I thought was one of the best purchases I'd ever made.  Out of the box and freshly connected, I was blown away with the sound quality and grinned from ear to ear--really couldn't have been happier.\n\nTHE BAD: However, after about 5 months issues started to develop with the quality. At first I noticed a crackling/shorting-out sound from the satellites whenever I adjusted the volume. This progressively got worse over the next few weeks. Then, intermittenly, one of the satellites would have no sound. I found that I could remedy this by jiggling the DIN connector at the back of the subwoofer.\n\nThis scenario got worse also, leading to a month or so where I could only get sound by finding a ""perfect"" spot where the connection seemed to not short out. This was always accompanied with loud ""crackle"" sounds and ""pops"". Eventually, I could only get the system to work if the cord was propped with an object to maintain that ""perfect"" spot.\n\nTHE UGLY: Finally, even all that manipulation would no longer work and the system was rendered completely dead after about 7-8 months. Now if you have the cash flow that enables you to blow a hundred dollars or more every 6-9 months on a pair of these in order to get the wonderful sound they do create, then go ahead and knock yourself out. If you are fine with that, enjoy, because I will not deny that they do have impressive sound. My bad was disconnecting these, hooking up a cheaper, not-nearly-as-good-sounding, but ever reliable set of Logitech speakers in the interim and forgetting about the Klipschs until the warranty had just expired. I called Customer Service and was told I could send them in and have them repaired for about seventy-five dollars (plus shipping). Yeah right, and have the same thing happen (and it would--guaranteed) all over again? NO WAY...I don't think I want to be that stupid.\n\nIf you read others' ratings you will notice a RECURRING THEME with these Klipschs:  GREAT sound quality...VERY inferior design and component quality.  I simply add mine to the list as a precaution to save frustration and the lightening of YOUR wallet. The only thing I would hope is that they would've made some design and quality control changes in the two years or so since I bought mine, but don't hold your breath.";The good, the bad, and the ugly
61;15.0;2.0;52.0;2662;The first point I would like to make is that Amazon is currently selling this for $180, with $20 shipping cost.  My local Best Buy stocks these, for $155, and throw in CA sales tax and you are still come in $30 cheaper than Amazon, and you'll have them today!  Also, I found out, Klipsch's own website offers these for $150 and free shipping!!!\n\nAnyway, ignoring the fact that the design reminds me of Windows-95 days, I bought them locally, and plugged them in only to realize I had a dead unit.  I can definitely agree with what the other reviews say about shoddy build-quality.  The wiring is definitely garbage.  Also, there seem to be TWO VERSIONS of this speaker... one has a replaceable fuse and on/off switch, and the other doesn't.  See photos:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B000062VUO/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_all\n\nThey sounded great in the store, but I can't justify spending over $150 on something that will break so easily!  I'm trying to replace my 11-year-old Harman/Kardon 2.1 system!!  I don't like stuff that breaks.  Thinking about it more, my h/k speakers have a much better design, both ergonomically and aesthetically.  Too bad they discontinued that model!\n\nI guess from here I'll try the Companion 3 Series II, or Z-2300s...;Had to return it
62;130.0;1.0;5.0;2682;"I can attest to the great sound quality of these speakers, if you are anything less than a finicky audiophile, you will be satisfied with the sound.\nUnfortunately, I can also attest to the horrible quality of construction, particularly the design of the din connector. If you try to place the sub-woofer under your desk (where it should be), the flimsy din connector, 'will' break. It juts out two inches from the back of the sub, if you brush it with your foot, or push it against the wall, your speakers are done. I am convinced that this is the cause of many of the failure complaints.\n\nThis happened to me of course, and I spent 20$ on a replacement ""control pod"" directly from the klipsch website. What I got was a model with the same defective design, even though newer models had addressed this design flaw, and were fully compatible with my speakers. After the din connector broke on the second control pod (about a months usage) I gave up.\n\nGood sound.\nBad design.\nLook elsewhere.";Great sound, poor design.

Then the subwoofer blew out completely.  I replaced the sub, but now one of the satellites has  loud static.  Don't know if I should even bother replacing it.\nUPDATE:\nI spoke too soon--  later in the same day as I wrote the original review, the DIN broke.  Don't tempt the fates!  ...and don't buy Klipsch Krap.;Great sound, won't stick around
64;51.0;1.0;15.0;2814;I bought these 2.1 speakers a little more than 2 years ago to replace a 4.1 set of Klipsch speakers that the front speakers stopped working. I never opened the subwoofer to see what burnt and purchased the 2.1 version. The 2.1 speakers are hooked up to a computer used for ripping and sharing music with my media computers around the house. Since I have a media computer on every Tv in the house I really don't use the computer with the Klipsch speakers anymore and leave them powered off. I started up the speakers this week because I needed to rip and add some new music to the shared music folder and heard a high pitched sound from my left speaker than a pop coming from the subwoofer. I opened up the subwoofer and noticed one of the boards (I am guessing the amplifier for the left speaker) was burnt. I also notice the power supply spacer was not even insert onto the bolt before tighting. The worst part of this is the left speaker midrange driver is also burnt!\n\nThis is the last set of Klipsch promedia speakers for me. I will not buy anything with a amp in it made by Klipsch again. For my HT I have a RF-83 Home Theater System without Klipsch subwoofer and will never buy a Klipsch subwoofer to go with it.\n\nI have a definitive subwoofer( That I will be replacing)in the living room thats never shutoff and still works like it did over 10 years ago. I think I will buy another definitive subwoofer.\n\nI do admit the promedia speakers sounded great when they worked, but the quality of the amps are junk. I do not recommend buying these speakers unless you think 2 years life is good enough for the money spent.;Great speakers but poor electronics.
65;136.0;3.0;5.0;2817;These sounded good while they worked.  I was happy with them the entire time that they worked(3.5 years).  Unfortunately, a few days ago they would not turn on at all.  No light, nothing.  I saw that the fuse was blown so I replaced it only for the replacement fuse to blow immediately.  I saw multiple links on the internet about the amp or various other components giving in.  So I took it apart and looked at it and decided I didn't have the expertise to attempt to fix it on my own.  So now Im stuck.  It seems by the reviews that Im not going to be able to replace this with any speaker system as good as this one.  And if I buy another Klipsch, I can pretty much count on it dying in a couple years.\n\nUpdate:  So after researching the market it still seems that I can't get anything as good as the Klipsch.  So I reluctantly bought another set.  As a result Ive upgraded my review from a 2 to a 3 star.  But now I have even more concerns about the longevity of this system.  The wires are all permanently connected to the speakers/subwoofer.  They cant be detached.  So if a cable breaks or goes bad, you have to get new speakers.  This is different from my previous ProMedia system which had detachable audio cables.;Great for 3.5 years, now dead

70;124.0;5.0;6.0;3467;Klipsh Promedia 2.1 offers the best audio quality in its price category. I have tested it against Logitech Z-2300  and in the end decided to go with Klipsh due to its far superior sound quality while playing cds.\nHowever, Logitech is worth its price times over. I liked its sound while playing streaming audio files (56 Kb) - internet radio, youtube, e.t.c. For compressed files Logitech with wider musical spectrum seems (or sounds) to be a better choice than more directional Klipsh. I did have hard time deciding between the two while playing DVDs, Klipsh offers more detailed and clearer sound but seemed somehow less dimensional than Logitech. With Klipsh the dialog seemed to be coming from the bottom of the screen, where Logitech more accurately matched the picture.\nThe thing that won me over to keep the almost twice expensive (must include extended warranty due to its notorious subwoofer problems) Klipsh was its unbeatable dominance with quality music. Logitech with its rather poor midrange was no competition. Playing CDs with Klipsh was a pure joy. The sound is very clear and warm, especially the vocals that sounded quite bland with Logitech just shined on Klipsh.\nSo the final conclusion. I don't think it's right to say one is better than the other - both carry exceptional value and leave its competition in the dust. Considering the price difference I would recommend Logitech to anyone with preference for mp3, streamed audio or video. However, if you keep popping CDs into your system, Klipsh is the only way to go.;Klipsh vs. Logitech
71;126.0;1.0;6.0;3576;"This Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speaker system seemed to be just what I was looking for -- a competent, modestly priced system for a room I don't use excessively which my main audio system doesn't cover.\n\nI assembled the system without much effort (a good thing, since the accompanying instructions were obviously an afterthought). I played a CD for several minutes (a demanding Art Blakey) and then tested things with the audio stream from my local PBS station. At that point I was impressed and most pleased. I went off to do something else not involving audio.\n\nThe trouble started several hours later. I returned to my computer and noticed the LED light on the control speaker was out. Several attempts to play audio failed. I checked all the connections, then unplugged everything and reassembled it. Nothing.\n\nI then went through the instructions (including the cursory ""troubleshooting"" section), hoping to pin-point something I'd missed. No luck. Then I recalled seeing a fuse port on the rear of the subwoofer (nothing about a fuse appeared in the instructions). I unscrewed this and noticed the fuse looked bad. Well, those things happen. The fellow at Radio Shack tested with his meter and confirmed that the fuse was dead. He hunted up a pack of replacement fuses. I returned home and installed one of these, then tried again.\n\nAfter turning the subwoofer switch to ""On"", I heard a ""poof"". This time I didn't even get to hear three minutes of the Art and his Jazz Messengers. At this point I decided I'd spent more time and effort than this $100 ""system"" was worth.

I would not recomend these, I paid 130 for them, and I don't think they sound as good as a 30 dollar speaker set.

One of the best, IMO (although my new HK Soundsticks have since won me over).  However, a couple months ago the subwoofer failed on me, for reasons I don't yet know.  I was considering having it repaired or just buying a new Klipsch set, but a little Googling turned up some forum discussions that indicate the subwoofer with this system is highly prone to failure.  Needless to say, this was very disappointing.  For that reason alone, I'm posting this review with a huge ding to the rating over this issue.  It's a shame, because otherwise they are a great choice.;Great sound, but the subwoofers apparently highly prone to failure
74;94.0;4.0;9.0;3627;In this review: an in depth comparison of Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 THX, Logitech Z-2300 THX, Bose Soundock,  Bose Companion 3's, Bose Companion 5's and  Altec Lansing t-612\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.  I'd like to offer a review somewhat different than what you've read before.  It's a long one so if you're looking for something quick, you may want to stop here.  Otherwise hopefully you'll enjoy the perspective.  My thanks go out to those who let us know who you are and what you do in your review, and how you use the system, it really makes a difference.  It's important to know the story behind why someone is buying something and what they are looking to do, otherwise you get mismatched needs and solutions.  My story begins during the first month of 2008, when I got myself  into a bit of a speaker craze while searching for a sound solution for every room of my house.  Three years ago I put my life's music collection in digital format on iTunes to the tune of over 5000 songs with perhaps the widest array of music than anyone else I know: Jazz, Hip-hop, R&B, trip hop, electronica, techno, country, audio books, Tony Robbins, metal, rock, dub, enigma type stuff, lounge, new-aje, world music, caribbean, Latin and on the list goes.  So, when I say I've tested these speakers over a wide variety of music, you can take my word for it.\n\nMy demographic: Male, business owner (custom Italian leather journals, guest books and photo albums: see epica . com ) and hip-hop dancer choreographer, 30 years old, Southern California.  Creative, very into pleasing the senses.\n\nAfter growing up with stereo systems that catered to more bass than clarity, my initial goal was to discover what would be the most clear, best, space filling rich sound I could in each room of the house while still being incredibly aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive at the best price.  I wanted to turn up the volume and be amazed at what I heard without any distortion and I wanted to be thrilled at the lowest volumes as well. I wanted to feel like I was there, to have a music experience every time I turned something on.  The best price part went out the door rather quickly.\n\nSo here's what I did:  Apple sells a device called an Airport Express that among other things such as being a wireless router, also allows you to stream iTunes music to it wirelessly.  All you have to do is plug in a stereo mini plug to one end and an audio source to another.  Give it a name like living room and it appears in iTunes. you can have several of these devices all over the house.  In the past I have always hooked up big stereos or shelf systems to it for sound but now in the age of tiny computer speakers and iPod doc systems, I've realized you can connect anything to it and have taken the experience to a whole new level.  There are now 4 airport expresses in the house in different rooms along with an apple TV which also features this Airtunes feature in the living room,  bedroom, second bedroom, kitchen and hallway... yes the hallway.\n\nAfter having spent hours in the Apple Store and Best Buy listening to different sound docks and speakers with my iPhone and collection of music, I just decided to purchase and used every single unit that caught my interest with the decision that those which didn't give me everything I was looking for, I'd just return. (The manufacturers must love me.)  Because what can you really tell about a speaker or sound system in a 30,000 foot warehouse with sound and people all around you?  Are you kidding? Nothing. You've really got to setup these systems in your environment.\n\nIt's also important that you test your purchase in different places and positions all throughout your house. You won't believe the difference in sound from having  say, a SounDock in your bathroom vs. a bedroom.  Move the subwoofer around, adjust the bass on it, move the speakers, be creative. you'll surprise yourself.\n\nFinally, a word about Bose.  Of all the sound companies that I read reviews for, and I read about 400 before making a purchase, I have never seen such a contrasting fan base.  You've got people who detest anything Bose and people who would buy it without listening to anything else. For the record I am neither of these people.  I have owned Bose products in the past and enjoyed them as I have with other companies but was not biased towards or against them prior to purchase.\n\nThe Systems:\n\nThe Klipsch Prop-Media 2.1 speakers were my purchase. I was attracted to what I knew about the Brand, the subwoofer control on the actual satellite speaker and the $150 price point.  I got them home and aesthetically I was just never really attracted to the speaker.  My place has a very Asian-Zen and modern feel and these just kind of stood out in the wrong way wherever I placed them.  But we're talking about sound so I looked past that. It's got a pretty large subwoofer, and the satellites where small enough to go anywhere. Klipsch does a great job with their horn tweeters and it really let's the highs soar.  I tried them in my home office and bedroom for a week before I returned them.  Why?\nI loved that they were THX, which means there was no hissing whatsoever and they were dead quiet when music was shut off.  I was also pleased and could not  believe the power. These speakers have so much gain and get so loud, that I don't think full volume would even be tolerable to the human ear. But that was the thing. They seemed to distort at the higher volumes I tend to enjoy and didn't seem to fill a room at low volumes. The subwoofer is recommended to be set at 8 o'clock (very low) and if you adjust that any higher the bass is quite over powering.  The sound coming from the Klipsch speakers was not a bad or poor sound, it was great, it was ridiculously powerful but it just wasn't the best sound I had heard for music. They ultimately went back to the store,  and I give them a 4 star rating, but I'd be open to trying them in again in a different setting.  I think I found them to be to cumbersome as well.\n\nTo their credit, RoomGroove wireless for $300, is their latest version of what I am doing with the airport express where you can link multiple room grooves up and they'll wireless send sound to each other. Points to them for finally getting something like this on the market.\n\nLogitech Z-2300 THX: WOW.  I was a little biased at first because I thought, Logitech? Really? The people who shine at making wireless mice and keyboards? How can they compare to these other big sound companies? What can they possibly bring to the table?  Five stars no question. Here I had nothing to go on other than the $150 price point. I brought them home and unpacked. Ok, the subwoofer with this speaker set is not for the faint of heart. It is absolutely enormous and well suited for a larger office or larger room.  It's got two attractive enough (without the grills) aluminum speakers, and a similar wired remote to the Bose only this has the subwoofer control on it (fortunately) and a headphone jack. (no external auxiliary mini plug)\n\nWhere to begin. This system has started off in and remains to this day in my office.  At low volumes it is rich, deep, clear, and not overpowering in any respect. The music soars no matter what you're listening to.  It's an absolute pleasure to sit before these speakers and  I should start leaving them playing some sort of music more often because it really really sounds tremendous.  And that's only the beginning.\n\nOnce the staff goes home and I can crank these up, every wall in the building shakes.  The other bathrooms sound as though there is an earthquake and we should evacuate the building. I know it sounds like I'm a big bass person but this is the least of my desires. The clarity, much like the companion 5's just keeps getting richer and richer as you turn the volume up. Artist's vocals scream out at you and this system is the loudest of any I have heard. Interestingly it's also the most tolerable at high volume that I have heard as well.\n\nI love the fact that it's got RCA jacks for speaker cables which allow you to easily extend them if you want them more than a few inches apart or want to place the subwoofer farther away than right at your feet.  I love the power and clarity of these speakers, I love that the remote has the bass on the module and you don't have to adjust it behind the subwoofer.  Five golden stars are easily awarded. Go Logitech.\n\nAltec Lansing T-612 and Bose SounDock Portable:\nHaving tested the Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks, JBL On Stage, Klipsch iGroove, the Zeppelin monster, iHome, logitech pure fi and many others, these are the two I wound up bringing home.\n\nTechnology is great. We give birth to new ideas which create new ways we listen to music like iPods and iTunes, and that stimulates thought to a new level and we create devices made especially just for these things like the wide array of docking stations, something we had no need for in the past, and then we give birth to new ideas again and say wouldn't it be great to have our music collection on our phone and eliminate devices, and that get's created, and one company wins out over all the others and soon that creates a new problem: cell phone interference and shielding and that gives birth to the first of a new line of products: the iPhone safe Altec T-612.  The first docking station to not be affected by sound interference from cell phones.\n\nIt worked well. I give it 5 stars for innovation, sound, it's own bass and treble controls on the unit that can be controlled by the remote control, size and a pretty unique look. (Which I am personally not attracted to) This purchase lasted 24 hours before it was returned. It was going to be used as a hallway speaker and so probably would not get much use out of the iPod Dock.  It goes for $200 which seems reasonable.  Ultimately though it did not have the fullness and richness, or spaciousness that the Bose did, and the bass cracked on several songs.  This is perfect for a teen, or college person or someone who just listens to music here and threre at reasonable volumes in the kitchen or around the house.\n\nBose SounDock Portable.  FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS, and no sale or special pricing. Certainly you have to have a unique perspective on money to purchase one of these for yourself.  One now resides in my bedroom and another in the hallway so certainly I'll share mine.  Are there alternatives on the market that you will be happy with? Absolutely.  $400 is a lot of money to spend on a device like this. Or is it?  I sell a $10,000 journal on the Epica website,  I have seen $12,000 pens, $400,000 automobiles, $200 for torn up jeans (and that's just a normal brand), $12 to see a movie, $50 for a tank of gas, $4000 for a high end washer and dryer... look at the world we live in.  Certainly dollar for dollar you are not paying for the product itself or the metal, cotton or components, EVER, but the value it brings to you. The features and luxuries and benefits it brings.  The feeling. And that always has a price.\n\nHow many times have you shopped for the best deal on something, bought it, and then later wished you had purchased the better version, or gotten the special optional features, or wish you had just splurged after the fact. How many times have you not been able to do it like when you purchase a car? I have just gotten myself used to two things. One: happiness comes from your thoughts and your ability to keep your mind and focus on things that please you, not from objects you buy, and two, the fact that if contrast has caused me to give birth to a desire for wanting something, and I think in the obtaining of it I will be more pleased in owning it than the less expensive version,  I am going to buy the one that brings me the most pleasure and gives me personally, the best feeling.\n\nNeed, purpose, design, size and functionality all coalesced with the SounDock and so I spent 200 more dollars after I returned the Lansing for something that would be kept in my hallway which pointed into the bathroom.  But it was more discreet, it had a revolving iPod dock that I could hide from view when not using it, a remote control that let me change my playlists (that most remotes do not do), a look that was much more attractive and streamline, and a sound that was just richer and fuller.\n\nAnd while it pains me immensely to know that I took the two-hundred heart pounding watts of Klipsch out of my bedroom, the amazing, clear, spacious and dynamic sound of the Bose Companion 3s out of my bedroom and now have replaced those with another SounDock, portable, it certainly does create magic in the bedroom.  Aside from two lamps, it is the ONLY other wire in the room. It's small, and doubles as my alarm clock. I LOVE the  fact that I can wake up to any song or play list in the world.  using an iPod  (I am very put off by Apple's decision to not have a snooze button on iPod alarm, while it is on the iPhone, however on the iPhone you can only wake up to a ringtone! Silly)  I love how it fills a room and how if you're not in the room you hear it loud and clear and would have no idea something so small is producing all that sound.\n\nI have really come to appreciate Bose. They create the best sound they can possibly engineer by pouring 100% of their profits back into research and deliver the best product they can that generally takes years to release. They think their sound sounds best flat, with no adjustment. That's what the EQ is for on the iPod or iTunes or whatever source you're using. They realize you shouldn't have to tweak all the treble and bass if the sound is just amazing to begin with.  It's all about the feeling you get when you listen to it.  The SounDock does not sound as good as a system like the Companion  3's or any other subwoofer driven device but you have to look at it's purpose and size.\n\nSounDock gets five stars for listening to customer requests and making their successful SounDock portable even better by adding the aux in port so I can hear music wirelessly, a great remote with lots of functionality, discreet touch volume buttons,  a hideaway revolving dock door to make it look even cleaner than it already does, a great room filling sound, a battery that lasts, a slimmer design, a power cord that wraps around the transformer and an overall sound that makes you feel very good when listening to it.  Try placing one of these things in your kitchen, hall, bathroom, closet or smaller room and listen to the rumble and sound. Amazing.\n\nBose Companion 3's: When I first set these up in my office I was absolutely amazed by the quality and quantity of sound coming out of these speakers.  They are gorgeous, discrete and fit the bill for big sound.  I was impressed by the fact that I could turn them up to full volume, with any kind of music and here no distortion of any kind. That one fact is so rare, that made them a winner for me right there.  When listening to Diana Krall, I felt as though her lips where inches from my ear as she sang only to me.  These speakers really sing out.\nFor some reason when I tried watching movies on them, the volume decreased significantly and so even at full blast the sound was not that loud. Over time these speakers have moved from office to bedroom to ultimately being returned to the store but not  because I was dissatisfied. I kept these things in my closet for 3 weeks because I didn't want to return them, I wanted to find a use for them or somewhere to enjoy them.  They went back because I didn't want 5 cords in my bedroom and a subwoofer at the foot of my bed.\n\nLike the companion 5's, I like the puck volume control  (would be nice if it was wireless, wouldn't it? Especially if everything else on your desk is).  It's very sensitive and feels good to touch. One gentle tap and sound is muted, another and it comes back on.  It's also nice to be able to increase or decrease the bass that pours out of these units on the back of the subwoofer by virtually a full 360 degrees.  I am also pleased with the RCA jacks used to connect each speaker. Initially I was put off and wondered why they did it but when I realized how EFFORTLESS (one of my favorite words) it was to extend the speaker cable, i.e.  just plug in another video cable, I was thrilled.  Five stars to the Companion 3s\n\nBose Companion 5's: It's funny how when you don't know what you're missing, you don't miss it.  I tell people that in my business that when you buy this $185 journal and you haven't seen the $265 version, you think you're in heaven. It's perfection.  Then you see the top of the line and you just can't imagine it gets any better. The Companion 5's are nearly triple the size of the Companion 3's (Yet still rather small and attractive), look absolutely gorgeous next to my iMac, have the same puck with mute, headphones, volume up and down and auxiliary input just like the Companion 3's (which will play something at simultaneously as what you have going on your computer).\n\nBUT there are two major differences in these speakers vs anything else I have heard, ever. One is it connects to your USB port, not your stereo mini plug in port which requires 2 minutes of configuring, and two, the sound that comes out of these speakers is the most delicious, exquisite, full, wide, spacious, rich, detailed sound I have EVER heard come out of speakers in this class.  Anyone I have shared them with leaves with their jaw on the floor. As I turn up the volume we just stare at the computer and say WOW.  It just sucks you in. Where  before I did not enjoy spending time in front of the computer for very long, I can literally spend hours in front of this one or in the room where the Companion 5's are playing. The sound is that unbelievable.  The cables as of this writing are proprietary and cannot be extended, however for the `surround effect' it's not recommended that you extend them anyway.\n\nI enjoy barely audible volume levels in the morning but come nighttime, I love to crank up the sound and  speakers can take it at a volume so loud you can only take it for a short period. It's as though with each increment you raise the volume, you experience a new dimension to sound.  The Bose Companion 5's for this purpose get 5 stars, 10 if I could, for looks, size and for a sound like no other.\n\nFinally, don't be led astray by the Bose advertising. These speakers are marketed towards people who like to watch movies in front of their computer, something that, after spending all day in front of a computer, is the last thing I want to do.  I've tried it and yes it's a great experience but if you never watch a video clip with these speakers it will still be the  best investment you make for music and any other sound that comes out of them.  The Bose experts will also tell you that these speakers should not be more than 24 inches apart because they are specifically engineered for you to sit right in front of them. When I heard that I also thought the sound quality would decrease if I stepped away, or perhaps it wouldn't fill a room the way I want.  Not the case. Inches away or across the room, I cannot say enough about this virtual surround sound speaker.\n\nSo hopefully that gives you a little more insight into what these speakers can do for you, how they can be used, what I was looking for in particular and what the actual experience was.  If you made it this far, your a trooper.  I hope you found the review useful and if you wanted to contact me with questions we actually sell on the Amazon site.

75;52.0;1.0;17.0;3686;I find the laudatory reviews here completely incomprehensible. Even with the volume on the bass unit at a minimum, this system sounds tubby and muddy, not only in the lower registers, but well up into the midrange. It can sound very nice on material like solo voice, nylon string guitar, or solo clarinet, but as soon as the material contains more voices/instruments, more bass, sharper attacks, and/or more complex dynamics, the sound gets horribly smeared.;Vastly overrated
76;69.0;5.0;12.0;3699;I second the positive reviews.  These are amazing.  And though it's not obvious, the headphone jack and input jack are easily accessed on the right speaker.  I couldn't be happier.;Easy access inputs
77;107.0;5.0;8.0;3734;"WOW! I'm amazed with Klipsch quality! This ProMedia system is amazing!\n\nI was searching for a high-quality 2.1 PC speaker system, and I was willing to dish-out $100-$200 for a good one; I've had many cheaper systems, which I did not especially grow fond of and did not last. Therefore I was willing pay for a good system that would please my ears and last me a long time. It came down to this Klipsch ProMedia 2.1, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 GMX, and the Logitech Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System; I had a difficult time deciding, and read reviews all over the internet before deciding. There are a ton of webpages dedicated to comparing and reviewing these systems, as they are all a great balance between cost and supreme audio quality (why pay over $400 for a BOSE system, when these are available?).\n\nThe ProMedia 2.1 (albeit older and less asthetically pleasing) is more power than the ProMedia 2.1 GMX system, so that ruled out the GMX, for I care more about quality and power than just the speaker's cool appearance. And for the Logitech Z-2300 system, although great in its own right, couldn't fully compare to the ProMedia 2.1 system.\n\nFirst of all, the ProMedia 2.1 is cheaper online than the Logitech, most likely due to the manufacturing age difference. Secondly, the Klipsch system has massive subwoofer (comparable to the Logitech system), but has both a primary driver AND a separate tweeter for each speaker, whereas the Logitech system ONLY has the primary driver. This drastically improves the high-frequency sounds, and thus a better music, movie, and game experience. Also, Klipsch has been around longer and is more trusted for quality construction, materials, and endurance than Logitech. These were my deciding factors for purchasing the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speaker system. Now I have used many Logitech systems in the past, which I enjoyed, so I'm not dissing Logitech, for they do make great PC speakers. But if you're stuck on a decision between the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 system and the Logitech Z-2300 system like I was, hopefully you'll make the right choice as I did and go with Klipsch.";The PERFECT 2.1 PC Speaker System!
78;49.0;1.0;18.0;3751;"I hate to be ""that guy"" that has a uniquely bad experience with a product everyone else loves and then has to rain on their parade, but so be it. The first time I bought these speakers they came with a faulty cord and had to be exchanged. The ones I have now developed a crackle in the left speaker about 2 months after purchase that has steadily gotten worse. Today (~9 months after purchase) the left speaker completely gave out and now sounds like someone shaking a can full of pennies. The speakers have only been used at reasonable volume levels and have no reason to fail so soon, aside from simply being poorly made.\n\nAs for the sound quality: Terribly underwhelming when compared to the great reviews. This will be the first and last Klipsch item I ever buy.";Worst speakers I've ever owned
79;143.0;3.0;5.0;3766;Loved these speakers...talk about one wall blasting system...crisp sound, great bass, clean highs and midrange. Bought them a little over a year ago and now the right speaker is now buzzing. Not good and Im very disappointed. I would have thought these would have been more durable. Too bad. Upgrading to another THX set but a 5.1 system...and not Klipsch.\nAmazing sound if only they would last.;Awesome ...BUT they sure didn't last long
80;144.0;3.0;5.0;3789;"Bought the Klipsch 2.1 speaker system in a retail store, not on Amazon.  Previously owned computer sound systems include a 2.1 Monsoon system and a powered Sony 2.0 speaker system (wood cabinet); the Sony is the better sounding of the two.\n\nThe reviews on Amazon provided useful suggestions and information on these speakers.  A few reviews contained suggestions about modifying aspects of the sound quality such as plugging the bass port to subdue the very prominent low-end.  There are also many reviews stating that these speakers lack mid-range; this is very true.\n\nMy system had the same problem another reviewer had with the right satellite speaker cutting out.  After messing around with the configuration, I discovered that the satellite speaker with the controls on it seems to work fine when connected as the left speaker (but has a cutout problem when connected as the right speaker).  Being right handed, I originally configured it as the right speaker.";disappointing midrange performance
81;108.0;1.0;8.0;3811;Never going to buy Klipsch again in my life. I was exited opening my new speaker system. I enjoy music. 3 hours later... I have a malfunctioning speaker.\nStay with logitech, they are the best.;right speaker blow up on the first day of use
82;116.0;4.0;7.0;3818;"Nothing much to disagree with the many other reviews here. I just got these speakers, took the risk of flaky quality in favor of good sound that I wanted for listening to music. I am hoping that they won't croak anytime soon.\n\nSo far, I am very pleasantly surprised about the sound, these speakers are, indeed, excellent for music, which is what I use these for exclusively. Very clear, crisp, detailed, spacious sound, revealing all nuances of voices and instruments. Miles apart from run-of-the-mill Logitech and other speakers available here. I had tried a 5.1 system before but returned it right away and decided to stick to 2.1 as my main task for these is music.\n\nReading other reviews, I expected the subwoofer to be causing minor earthquakes and was surprised that it is actually rather benign and not overwhelming at all. My Harman Kardon 10"" woofer in the living room can literally vibrate my wood floors, but I find the Klipsch woofer very balanced for this application and the control allows to tune that further to personal taste.\n\nHowever, I have this woofer sitting on my special bass-decoupling feet. Here's the tip for everyone concerned about both bass vibrations and overheating the woofer: take two old tennis balls and cut them with a sharp utility knife exactly in half (careful with those fingers!). This will give you four excellent vibration dampers. Put the flat side towards the woofer and the round side towards the floor. This will give you a *very* dry bass and will prevent it from propagating through the floor. Your neighbors and the sleeping family will be forever grateful... If the woofer is visible, color the balls with matte graphite-black spray-paint.\n\nImprovements needed:\n\nKlipsch chose to put the preamplifier into one of the satellites, which requires that four (!) cables have to run to that satellite, a rather poor engineering choice (likely to accommodate the mp3 player input). Sound cable from the computer goes to the satellite and from there to the woofer's main amplifier (both hardwired). The actual sound signal goes then from the woofer back to the satellites. An annoying cable clutter across my desk.\n\nThe satellite stands should be adjustable, as somebody else mentioned. When placed next to the monitors, the speakers are pointing towards my upper tummy, not my ears.\n\nThe volume and woofer controls are rather wobbly and made of unsightly rubber - a purely aesthetic issue.\n\nThe flimsy speaker wires were mentioned many times. They are not only too thin (22-gauge, I believe), they are also too short even for my setup with the woofer sitting right under the desk, but in the opposite corner. Those cables should be 16 gauge and at least 3 ft longer.\n\nSo far so good. It's late and the speakers sound excellent even at very low volume.... Enjoy!\n\nUpdate: more than 7 months later and the speakers are still working fine, no performance problems here. I get the occasional issue that the left speaker won't work, but somebody posted the work-around: just crank up the volume briefly and it comes back to life. I also never shut down the speakers, hence, no issues with the sub woofer or amplifier. Solid performance with great sound. A good purchase, which I can recommend.";Excellent sound, some improvements needed
83;13.0;4.0;63.0;3820;"I blew a ridiculous amount of time listening to them in the store, reading reviews and what not and it never really helped me decide.  I ended up buying all 3 and hooking them up so I could test drive them.  Then returned the ones I didn't keep.  Hopefully someone in the same situation I was in will benefit from my review.  If you can't decide I recommend buying the ones you can't decide between and test them yourself.\n\n  SPEAKERS:\nKlipsch Promedia 2.1, Logitech z-2300, Bose Companion 3\n\n  BACKGROUND:\nPrevious Speakers- Creative 6.1, think they were the original inspires.\nSound Card- Creative x-fi\nPrimary use- Gaming with limited music\nVolume- maybe max out around 10%.  Live in multifamily complex and don't need a lease breaker to live up to its name.\nEar quality- I'm no sound engineer so all references to quality of sound are just what MY ears heard.\n\n  6.1 V 2.1:\nYou will not find any 2.1 system that rivals even a cheap 5.1 or 6.1 set.  No way around that.  In downgrading you are compromising from the start.  If you have the space/cash/mounting locations go with 5.1 or higher. [This may or may not be an appropriate or accurate statement.  See comments below]\n\n  SOUND QUALITY:\nThe Klipsch had the best overall performance when it came to sound.  Second was Bose and third was Logitech.\n\nI was not at all impressed with the Logitechs.  They had a nice booming sound but no matter how much I fiddled with the EQ could I get a clean consistent sound across the board.  Highs sounded watered down, Mids sounded muted and the Lows were...booming in a good way.  Granted I'm sure this had a lot to do with the fact that I wasn't turning them up very loud.  When I cranked them up they sounded much better but that's not the situation I needed them for.  If you are throwing a block party the sound quality might be great.\n\nThe Klipsch definitely had the best overall sound.  It seemed to have a little trouble with definition on the highs and the extreme lows but far out did the other two with the mids and the lows.  When I say trouble I mean nothing noticeable if you didn't have multiple speakers hooked up at the same time.  This could once again be attributed to the fact that I'm running them at such a low volume.  As far as the extreme lows, I don't think either of the other two systems even had those lows to listen too.\n\nThe Bose handled the highs with crystal clarity.  They do have the ""tin can"" effect that other reviewers have mentioned but adjustment of the EQ was able to compensate for that.  The mids had to be corrected with the EQ but once setup right they were adequate, nothing to write home about, but better then the Logitech and not as good as the Klipsch.  The lows thumped nicely and seemed to fit well but on extreme lows it seemed to be more of a single rumble as opposed to individual sounds.\n\n  REAL ESTATE:\nThe Bose significantly outshine the other two sets when it comes to desk real estate.  The footprint of each satellite is about 2.5x2.5 inches.  Headphones might take up less space.  The Logitechs and the Klipsch take up about the same amount of space on the desk.  Slightly larger than your average desktop speaker but not so large that you can't fit them on the desk.\n\n  CONTROLS:\nAll three sets had the same set of controls and inputs on them, namely bass, volume, and a miniplug out or two.\n\nI preferred the Bose when it came to the controls.  The little wired remote puck thing works excellently and sticks to the spot you put it.  The volume control consists of turning the outside of the puck and works excellently.  One added feature is the top of the puck is a touch activated mute button.  Useless really since the volume is so easy to adjust but nice all the same.  The bass control for the Bose is located on the back of the sub near the top.  The sub sits under my desk so it's easy enough to adjust by just reaching behind it from the top and turning the knob.\n\nSecond would be the Logitech set.  They also have a wired remote similar to the bose.  Has a couple knobs on it a large (not as large as the bose puck) one for volume and smaller one for bass.  They seemed to turn smoothly and work great.  The one thing I didn't like about the Logitech remote was that it was very light and didn't really stay where you put it.  Some double side tape or a rubber pad would easily fix that.\n\nThis is one spot where the Klipsch comes in last.  I read that the controller could be removed from the speaker but didn't see an easy way to do it and didn't want to muck them up since I would be returning 2 of the 3 systems.  The Klipsch controls are located on the right speaker similar to your normal OEM speakers.  There is a volume and bass knob.  The volume knob didn't seem as smooth as the other two systems and tended to jump as opposed to smoothly increase and decrease the volume.  This might just be that it's a small knob and harder to make precision changes.\n\nThe power button is never a concern of mine because I leave everything on all the time but for those that it is an issue: Logitech had a power switch on the sub and ""sleep"" button on the remote.  Both the klipsch and the bose have the power switches on the back of the sub.  None of the power switches on the back of the subs are easy to get to or locate so if you can handle just putting it in sleep mode I'd recommend the Logitech.\n\n  BUILD QUALITY:\nI don't mean the build of the actual cones but of the housings, stands, etc.  I don't know enough about construction of or speaker materials to make a judgment on the cones and drivers.\n\nI think the Bose probably won in this category with the Logitech coming in second and the Klipsch bringing up the rear.\n\nBoth the Bose and Logitech went together well and everything fit tight.  Everything seemed to be appropriately built with acceptable tolerances in terms of stands and housings.  The Logitech's satellites were mostly plastic with cloth speaker grilles metal grilles on the sub.  The sub was particle board I'm assuming with a metal grille.  The Bose satellites were all metal including stands and grilles.  The sub was particle board I'm assuming with a metal grille.  Moving the speakers around and doing whatever over the course of testing them seemed to have no side effect on the operation of these two sets.  Everything on each system seemed to use a heavy enough gauged wire that I was not concerned with damaging them as I yanked them through the rats nest behind my desk.\n\nThe Klipsch fell short on the build quality.  They used comparable materials as the previous two, plastic satellites with cloth grilles and what I'm assuming is a particle board sub with a metal grille.  The stands for the satellites were cockeyed causing the speakers to lean at some odd angles.  Nothing that your average person would notice but someone in QC should have caught that.  The little ps2 looking cable that connects the controller to the sub didn't fit securely or snap into the sub.  Is to be expected of this style cable but on the other two systems I didn't have any concern if it connected appropriately.  After initial setup of the speakers the left satellite went out on me and I had to jiggle/turn the miniplug plugged into the back of it.  This is nothing new to miniplugs but I would have liked to have had the system setup for a good year before I had to start jiggling stuff.  None of these matters are real deal breakers but I noticed no problems with the other two systems.  It causes me to question what else might not be done as right as it should be done.\n\nOne thing nice about the Klipsch is that the connections for the satellites are normal speaker wire with a miniplug on the end.  Should be fairly easy to rig up your own connectors if the supplied separation distance isn't enough for your needs.\n\n  CONCLUSION:\nIf you want the best sound you can find, go with the Klipsch hands down.  If size is your concern go with the Bose.  Most other items noted are personal taste and opinion so you can make your judgments of off my previous information.\n\n  WHAT'D I KEEP?:\nI kept the Bose.  They look incredible, save my desk space well and at low volumes with an adjusted EQ they seem to sound good enough to do the job.  I love the puck controller as well.  I know many people dislike Bose but I think they have a nice product in the Companion 3's.  It should probably be priced between $75 and $150 but an extra $100 spaced over an estimated 5 years of use is only $20 a year.";Klipsch v Bose v Logitech
84;97.0;1.0;9.0;3852;"If you had asked me to write this review 2 years ago when I got the product I would have easily given Klipsch 4 or 5 stars. The quality of the sound has been excellent. A few months ago, however, the left speaker suddenly stopped working altogether. Two months later, the right one went out completely. I checked my connections, my sound card, everything was as it was supposed to be. The connector on the back would make clicking very loud clicking noises when turned or moved. When I called tech support (after a ridiculously 30-minute hold time) the guy ""immediately"" knew what the problem was. He said the entire back on the sub-woofer panel had to be replaced, all for just $50 plus shipping --that's one third of the original price! Plus, if the guy was able to pinpoint so easily what the problem was based on the symptoms, then I'd imagine he's heard the same problem before and they already know about the defect. Just read the other negative reviews and you'll see the exact same story repeated.\n\nI'm quite disappointed with the quality of this product if it's only meant to last 2 years.

86;33.0;4.0;25.0;3888;These speakers are beautiful in almost every way.  I have more or less switched from listening to music on my stereo to listening on my computer... And I'm happy I did!  These speakers have a fuller sound, and are louder than any stereo speakers I've owned.\n\nI would have given them a perfect five except for a couple of cons.\n\n1)  As a few reviewers have mentioned, the cables that these speakers come with are absolutely horrid.  When I opened the box, I actually thought that the wrong cables had been included.  They were flimsy and made of steel and the sound would cut in and out intermittently as signal was lost.  Also annoying, the only cables that work with the satellite speakers are raw wire to 1.5mm mono jacks.  The only place that you can find that sort of cable is the Klipsch website, where they sell for $26.  I finally broke down and for about fifteen dollars I made myself a much nicer set of cables with gold-plated jacks and heavier guage copper wire (which, by the way, was very simple).\n\n2)  This is a much bigger complaint (and warning), and I'm surprised I haven't seen it mentioned in any of the other reviews: DO NOT TURN OFF THE POWER!!!  There is a reason that the power switch is located way far out of the way on the back of the subwoofer.  I decided that I didn't like that the pretty little light on the left speaker was glowing all night and all day even when I wasn't listening, and so, being environmentally conscious and cheap, I turned off the speaker every night and every day when I went out.  When I turned the speakers back on there was that friendly *THK* noise that let me know the speakers were on.  However, don't be fooled!  That little noise, not too loud and somewhere in the lower middle register, is the lowest frequency the satellites can handle before the sub kicks in, and the speakers are not designed to play that frequency with much regularity.  Now my speakers hum and rattle when I play music with that particular frequency of bass (which granted is not that often).  Fortunately, the Klipsch website also carries replacement satellite speakers for twenty-six dollars apiece.  When I'm feeling a little more flush I'll probably replace my old rattling ones.\n\nAll in all, though, these are very good speakers and these are relatively small complaints.  I would highly recommend these to anybody.;WARNING!
87;63.0;3.0;14.0;3894;"Most speaker manufacturers state the frequency response of their product within a range.  For instance, 30-20k HZ +/- 3dB.  There's a reason that Klipsch does not give the +/- figure.  These speakers are far from flat.\n\nThere is a very noticeable spike around 2k Hz, which lends a metallic quality to sound.  There is also a deep dip around 500 Hz, which accounts for the deficient midrange several reviews have noted.\n\nThe crossover on the sub is set too high, which leaves the satellite speakers sounding flat and makes the sub's output quite directional.  You aren't supposed to be able to tell where a sub is located, its output is simply supposed to ""be there.""  Not this sub.  Place it off to the side, and everything will sound lopsided, no matter if it's music, movies or games.\n\nThe sub is not magnetically sealed, which means you cannot place it very close to a CRT monitor without suffering a distorted picture and risking permanent damage to the monitor.  Very foolish to design this sub without magnetic shielding.\n\nThe On/Off switch is on the back of the sub, not on a satellite.  Since the sub can't be placed near a CRT monitor, expect to get up and walk over to the sub every time you want to turn it on or off.\n\nWith equalization to counteract the system's inherent frequency response, this system can sound simply amazing.  The satellites will still suffer some lack of depth because the mid-range that helps define depth is just not there, it's at the sub.\n\nI have to say, I'm a little amazed these passed THX certification....";Far from perfect.
88;36.0;1.0;24.0;3896;Garbage!....they sound great but the input cable in back of the subwoofer is fragile.

89;145.0;4.0;5.0;3903;"I would have given these a 5 rating but for one 25 cent oversight: the cables that connect the sub to the satellites are far to measly to properly drive the midrange.

Though this model was already highly recommended to me, I sound-tested several other brands at the store, including a set that was well over $300. None were better. Rocks my house.\n\nBut:\n\nThere is a manufacturing flaw in the powered subwoofer connection.  After about 8 months of sonic joy, the main cable connecting the subwoofer to the satellites just dropped out when I picked it up to move it. The metal cuff with the pins detached from the plastic sleeve at the end of the cable. No yanking or tugging..or even touching. It just fell away. I found it still sitting inside the socket on the bass.\n\nYup. A 20 cent piece that renders the whole system inop.\n\nI have been trying to get a replacement for the $25 volume control pod (with the necessary cables and connections) from Klipsch for well over a month, but it is 'unavailable', and the techs on the phone keep giving me different dates on when I can get it.\n\nAnd I've found that this is a common enough occurance to have created a little sub-market online for repairs to this one exact connector in this one exact Klipsch model. Which may also explain why they can't keep the replacement piece in stock.\n\nA seriously irritating problem on an otherwise wonderful product. I want my sound back!;Amazing sound - with a small but important warning...
91;74.0;2.0;11.0;3957;The Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speakers deliver excellent highs and impressive bass, but lack the mid tones essential to so much music.  While the speakers sound great for movies, TV shows, rap, and pop music, they certainly require EQ adjustment when listening to rock, jazz, and country.  They aren't bad speakers, but my room mate's Logitech speakers are more veritile and don't require the adjustments.  If I could do it over again, I would have gone with the Logitech Z-2300.\n\nUpdate:  After roughly 4 years of use (very heavy the first two years, and very light the next two years due to a move with a different setup), these speakers no longer work. Something has happened with the main connection from the sub to the satellite.  I downgraded the rating to 2 stars, because for the money I feel like they should have lasted longer.;Lacks mids
92;132.0;4.0;6.0;3963;This 2.1 system sounds good compared to other powered PC speakers and can be considered a notch or two above the rest.  I compared them to several offerings from Logitech and Creative (both 2.1 and 5.1 systems).  I offer this opinion based on the fact that they were as neutral sounding as I could find.  My biggest problem with ALL of these powered speaker systems is with the mids.  Mids eat it big time on each system I tried and these Klipsch's are no exception.  But, they were the best sounding of any that I tried.\n\nSo the bottom line is: These are the best available if you're going to go with powered PC speakers.  On the other hand, getting one of those inexpensive receivers with some cheap speakers would probably yield better sound.\n\nReality check:  I don't expect PC speakers to blow me away, but I need a minimum level of sound to enjoy the experience.  FYI, my reference system consists of: PSB Stratus gold x4 plus Stratus center, Anthem 5 channel, Sony E9000es pre-amp.\n\nOverall Pros:\n\n- Better, more neutral sound when compared to other similar systems\n- Little distortion\n- Bass sounds good with sub on a low setting\n\nOverall Cons:\n\n- Mids are weak (but better than others)\n- Highs can be a bit shrill at higher volumes\n- No power switch on control module;Good when compared to other powered PC speakers but with caveats
93;134.0;1.0;6.0;3977;I'm writing this review while on hold on Klipsch's Technical Support line. My ProMedia 2.1 worked for 2 years, then choked 'out of the blue.' Personally, I'm going back to the old analog CD+Amplifier+REAL SPEAKERS. By comparison, the ProMedia sound is sub-standard. Besides, I never had to stand in line at the Post Office to return defective speakers or amplifiers built by Sony. The Klipsch ProMedia is just poor quality engineering on many fronts. Did anyone even test these lemons? If you're into throwaways electronics, then buy it. If you're not ... RUN!.;ProMedia = NO MEDIA

So, I looked, read several reviews and bought the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1. It took me all of 5 minutes to set it up and plug it in, and another 5 minutes adjusting levels.  What an impressive change!  Great bass, which is what I wanted most out of aux. speakers.  One thing: The on-off switch should be located next to the volume knob on the right-side satellite speaker, within easy reach. Getting down on my knees to turn it off is the pits.  One other complaint: I e-mailed Klipsch twice, asking them if there was any harm in leaving the speakers ""on,"" but to date I've never received a reply.  I hope this isn't indicative of their service, if I ever need it.  I bought these from Amazon, and their service was fast and faultless.";These speakers are fantasic on a new iMac
95;135.0;5.0;6.0;4004;I have been running the 2.1's for about a month now.  For sheer clarity, punchy bass, and accurate reproduction I have to rate this system as outstanding.  For the sound quality on MP3's, lots of adjustability for various genre's of music.  For DVD movies, I am really impressed.  Theatre quality sound for just over a hundred bucks? ridiculous! But, Klipsch hit a home run with these beauties. 5 Stars!;Worth every penny!
96;147.0;5.0;5.0;4008;The sound quality is amazing. The price is relatively lower than other models  and it is not worth spending so much money on anything else than this. Before i bought this thing, i did not know that it was so powerfull. I have a bose 3.2.1 system as well. These speakers are as good and powerfull as those and the funny thing is they are 600 dollars cheaper then the bose. I should have bought these speakers from the beggining.;Don't look anywhere else
97;8.0;5.0;81.0;4016;"I purchased the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX solution last week after reading the reviews here. For the most part, the reviews are accurate.\n\nShort Version: These computer speakers are definitely worth the price I paid (about $150 locally at Best Buy).\n\nLonger Version: The primary use for the speakers is for music, mostly MP3 (high 320 bitrate, ""CD quality"" rips). There is the occasional CD and game, but mostly the MP3 library. I listen to MP3s from literally every genre there is, including oldies, country, jazz, classical, and rap/hip-hop, but the majority of listening is metal, hard rock, and classic rock.\n\nWanting to step up from my ""budget"" Harmon-Kardon 3-speaker system I considered this Klipsch solution, as well as the Bose Companion 3 and 5. Due to the USB-only option on the Bose Companion 5 it was quickly ruled out.\n\nHaving the search narrowed between the Klipsch ProMedia ($150) and the Bose Companion 3 ($250) I headed off to Best Buy, knowing they sold both and had them in stock. As luck would have it, they were set up for demos side-by-side. I first listened to the Klipsch, then the Bose, then repeated both. My wife and myself were both immediately convinced that the Klipch offered a much fuller and richer sound. The Bose had little midrange and was to tinny sounding. The choice was obvious, and the Klipsch was $100 less.\n\nBrought them home and set them up immediately. Definite quality look and feel to the speakers, subwoofer/amp, and even cabling. Documentation is minimalistic, but setup is not that difficult for the general user.\n\nThe system sounded very good upon initial trial. I played parts of 10-20 MP3s of varying genres, all at very high volume. If you max out the volume there is some distortion (despite what some others have said). But, in most situations I find it unlikely that anyone would max out the volume on this system. They are designed for the listener to be located a few feet away, in front of the speakers, not for a whole-house sound system.\n\nThe sound range is excellent on these speakers. The design is well though out. The product is definitely worth the $150 and certainly on par, or better than, the Bose offering. The Bose does ""look better"", but are you buying speakers for visual or sound?\n\nBased upon my initial impression, and assuming these speakers hold up well over the expected life-span I would definitely recommend them, and would buy them again myself for another computer if needed.";Best bang for the buck...
98;50.0;5.0;18.0;4033;"I currently own 4 sets of 2.1 Promedia speakers and I have been truly amazed and impressed with the sound quality of them. Originally I purchased one set from Best Buy back in 2002 for around $165 and loved it. To my pleasant surprise the owner manual showed how I could connect two 2.1 speaker sets to my computer. Then I had to create this 4.2 beast of a system. So I purchased the second set for Christmas of 2003 for about $120 and I was not disappointed with the quality of the sound they produced. I especially liked how the 2 subs would work in tandem with each other while listening to music and when watching movies it gives the bass a front and dimension making the surround sound more realistic. This made me think about getting a third set and making a 6.3 monster. I purchased the other 2 sets about 6 months ago when I accidentally punched a hole in one the actual subwoofers. I thought about trying to get it repaired but I saw that Best Buy had the 2.1's on sale for only $85. So I got 2 more sets, one to replace the damaged one and another to create my 6.3 monster system. Now the only problem I've had with these speakers over 6 years are the control pods, in particular the DIN cable that comes out of them. About every 6 to 9 months the cable goes bad causing a dramatic loss of bass to the connected sub. I've purchased numerous control pods from Klipsch over the years for $21.98 until 16-months ago I learned that the pods have a 12-month warranty on them. Now Klipsch replaces them for free. This was only a minor inconvenience until this last year when Klipsch regularly did not have them in stock for several months at a time. It was at this point I began to write to Klipsch and attempt to find a permanent solution to the DIN cable problem. I ask if they could send me an unassembled pod or just the DIN cable itself, it was then I learned the crux of the problem. Klipsch, doesn't make the control pods, they only make the speakers. An outside company makes them and sends them to Klipsch already assembled; hence the long delays in restocking them. I informed Klipsch that these pods are of inferior quality beseeched them to stop doing business with this company for it is giving Klipsch a bad name. But they probably have a contract of some kind with this company to produce the control pods for so many years and the cost for breaching that agreement could be enormous. So we the customers just have to endure this disgrace to the Klipsch name until they make the control pods, or find a company that can make the pods worthy of the legendary Klipsch name. As a side I note I've found the Klipsch customer service and their technical service incredible completely living up to the Klipsch name. Every time emailed them I received a reply in at least a timely fashion if not within 24 to 48 hrs. They were polite, acted professional, and treated me with respect. They were extremely knowledgeable about the product and they knew what they were talking about. Any numerous times the went above and beyond what was required of them and answered many questions in depth regarding other companies products in particular Creative Labs sound cards.";Multiple 2.1 Speaker Systems

100;35.0;5.0;25.0;4035;"I am an unabashed audiophile.  So when I bought my new PC last year and the LCD monitor came with these tinny little integrated speakers, I knew it just wouldn't satisfy my rather demanding ears.  After shopping around, these seemed to be consistently rated quite highly, so I figured I'd take the plunge.\n\nMost audiophiles will tell you that the relationship between price and sound quality is highly non-linear.  In other words, you can spend four times as much on a pair of speakers and they will rarely sound four times as good - usually not even twice as good.  But I have to make an exception here.  These were admittedly some of the more expensive 3-way speaker systems out there for computers, but they are so far above everything else that I listened to that spending less money would have honestly felt like spending money without getting anything worthwhile in return.  Buying a bottle of wine and finding vinegar inside.  Yes, they are that good...everything else will feel like vinegar by comparison.\n\nI have never been a particularly big fan of 5- or 7-way home theater speaker systems for listening to music.  They are fine for listening to movies where you want to hear helicopters, bullets, and explosions surrounding you, but who sits in the middle of the band or orchestra when listening to music?  And since I'm not much into gaming, I figured a good 3-way speaker system (L, R, and subwoofer) would be more than adequate. The other thing about speakers for a computer is that the listener is usually in the same position, so the speakers don't need to fill the room with sound and match its acoustics - they simply need to give me a reasonable listening experience while I'm sitting directly in front of my screen.\n\nWhen I unpacked these little beauties and plugged them in, to say I was impressed would be a true understatement.  They are breathtakingly good speakers for the money.  I have also been very impressed with the customer service offered by Klipsch.  My subwoofer sits on the floor, and when I moved my desk to do some vacuuming, I managed to damage one of the connectors.  Klipsch replaced it for a very nominal fee and the design of the speaker system was such that I could easily do it myself.  What more could you ask for?\n\nOne other thing I'll add: I like to crank my music.  My 11-year old is constantly chiding me, ""Dad, turn it DOWN!""  If you like to rattle the windows, there is more than enough juice here to do the job thanks to a 200 W integrated amplifier in the subwoofer.  No, you won't actually use all those 200 watts (unless you want to break the windows, not just rattle them), but having all that headroom means you get a very clean sound, free of the distortion you're likely to get from lesser systems or when relying solely on the wimpy output of your computer's sound card.\n\nSure, you can buy systems with more speakers in them, but if - like myself - your primary purpose in buying computer speakers is to listen to music, more speakers is simply overkill.  And yes, you can certainly spend less money on speakers, but as the old adage goes, ""you get what you pay for.""  I can assure you that if you purchase these speakers, you will not feel that you have overpaid.  There will be no buyer's remorse -only a gift that keeps on giving with consistently great sound.\n\nWithout hesitation, they are worth every one of the 5 stars I'm awarding.";Worth every penny
101;100.0;5.0;9.0;4035;"I first heard these speakers when I was a salesperson for Circuit City in 2001. Through the years I compared a few dozen different brands and models.

This is by far the best blend of sound quality, smooth bass and a complete sound range.\n\nI can very easily hear a difference in compressed audio and CD/DVD audio; the sound quality is that good. I use these mostly for music and occasionaly for DVDs. They are suitable for any music, hip-hop trance, rocks, jazz...you name it. The bass is never overwhelming and the mid range sounds are perfectly produced.\n\nMy recommendation is this: try not to fall into marketing and pricing. Go to your local circuit city or best buy and try these out along with the logitechs and others.

And while I did not listen to any of the systems before buying, I plunged forth on this system based on the preponderance of good comments. Well, I ordered them a week ago, received them three days later and have been thrilled with them ever since. They look and feel substantial, have plenty of wiring length so the bass can be located at a convenient distance (while other systems' short wires limit you to placing it under your desk at your feet), are priced at an incredible $111.75, and sound GREAT!  The only curious part is that these are REAL speakers by a REAL speaker company (which is obvious by the speaker connections), and so I can't figure out how they can sell them so cheaply.

These play loud without stress or listenting fatigue, a common problem with small systems. I tried and then returned a very beautiful set of Altec Lansing 2.1's with stainless steel finish. These cost much more than the Klipsch set and tempted me. Good sound but needed lots of treble reduction to be listenable and creted fatigue after an hour of listening. Klipsch Promedia are superior. Trust me, I own very high end home theater stuff (Dali, Parasound etc) and have had many audiophile set ups over three decades, and these $150 speakers play smooth, detailed and room filling hi fidelity. Not only near field while you sit in front of your monitor but from across a large room. They do justice to jazz vocals, string bass and thumping rock and roll. Imaging is superb as well.

Please read the rest of my review if you are interested in what I hope is a bit more nuanced opinion.\n\nWhat I CAN say is that these are very high fidelity speakers, and without being an audio engineer or an electrician myself, I would venture to say that these speakers test the fidelity/quality limitations of 128-160 kbs MP3 music (the most common.) That is to say, it is hard for me to believe that higher fidelity could come from a 1/8"" conventional soundcard nor could it come from 100-200kbs mp3 formats- Thus I am suggesting that perhaps these are speakers of such quality that they are limited by their source.\n\nSo what I am ultimately trying to get across to somebody who is thinking of dropping the money on these speakers is that if you have MP3 music encoded in common formats like 128kbs etc. and a common sound card with 1/8"" outputs, these speakers are probably the highest quality you can find.\n\nWhether a person could find a 2.1 1/8"" input speaker system for less money that would be just as good, given the limitations of the source, is out of the scope of the advice I have just given. These are a quality product that I give 5 stars.

I got rid of the crummy 3CD, tape, radio system I had my computer pumped through and needed some decent speakers.  I listen to music all the time (I'm not a gamer) so I decided to buy some decent speakers for the task.  Even though another online reviewer (CNet) suggested the Logitech system, I bought these bad boys - Klipsch has been making high-quality speakers for a long time, Logitech makes great peripherals, but who knows about speakers, I want midrange for music, not just thump for games.\n\nI was completely blown away when I first plugged these in.  The sub is bigger than others and heavy, but it delivers Great bass.  The satellites are also larger than others, but not gigantic.  They fit nicely on my moderate desk.  I listened to these speakers for an hour, just enjoying my favorite music, and some THX specials.  Here we go:  Pros - Great sound, bass, midrange, treble - LOUD when you want them to be, you can tweak the equalizer on whatever program you use for music to get the balance just right for what you're doing - Volume switch and sub level right on the satellite - Great sound, everything sounded perfect.  Cons - Power switch is on the back of the sub - Possible deafness or angry neighbors with the volume up too much - Higher in price than other systems, but on sale right now at Amazon and WELL WORTH IT.\n\nAll in all, I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these to anyone looking for great computer speakers.

In my opinion, the amount of equalization required to correct this would be excessive and result in distortion and phase issues. Bottom line: your music will never sound quite right. Specifically, nylon string guitar sounded thin, saxophone sounded like a kazoo, and lead guitar sounded shrill like nails on chalkboard or a dentist's drill.  In a word:  Yuck!!\n\nIt's unfortunate that Klipsch hasn't got the memo yet, but these things seem to be flying off the shelves.\n\nThe ProMedia Ultra is a much better bet for accurate reproduction of music, although it is sorely lacking in the bass department.\n\nMy recommendation is to get the PM Ultra speakers and to buy the PM THX 2.1, use the 2.1 sub with the PM Ultra speakers, and sell the PM THX 2.1 satellites on eBay. I did this and have an amazing sounding system for the money. Sure it's a bit pricey, but there are deals to be had on eBay for the patient bidder and this system compares favorably to my home theater. It won't shake the house, but it does sound darn good.\n\nPS FWIW I am a semi-pro bassist/guitarist and a former Car Audio competitor, so I have a pretty good idea of what good sound actually is.";0
113;78.0;1.0;11.0;4301;Speakers are ok but the sub refuses to work. Sub lasted about three weeks and then started cutting out. The problem is a bad plug that many people are complaining about on Klipsch's site. They replaced it and the replacement is bad too. Not recommended!;good company bad product
114;90.0;5.0;10.0;4321;I bought these at Best Buy after looking at all the speakers that Best Buy and Circuit City had to offer.  Each of the speakers had sound tests and far and away the Klipsch speakers not only sounded the best but also were the easiest to control the sound of.  The main volume and subwoofer volume is located on the right speaker in front so it's easy to turn the bass up or down as well as the volume.  Sound quality is incredible.  The best part of these speakers is that the price also great.  When you compare the prices to the other speakers available Klipsch blows them away.  As a final fact that sealed the deal for me, a Best Buy employee told me that a near by movie theater (with great sound mind you) used Klipsch speakers.  If you're looking for great computer speakers, these are it.;These sound GREAT!!!!
115;150.0;5.0;5.0;4324;I replaced my old altec lansing 4221s with these today and man these ROCK or what !!!! I'm listening to Megadeth right now and the drums are coming out clearer than ever. The low vibe on the double bass is so tight. I played Carcass, Arch Enemy and Pantera to test the Sub and the bass never felt better. If you're a fan of high speed double bass drumming this baby's got it all.\n\nOverall great speakers. Mids are good, Highs are crisp (cant believe the cymbals) and the Bass..ohh just love the bass. Nice speakers for your PC if you're planning to buy them. I actually compared them head to head with a set of Bose speakers (same type) at BestBuy and they beat Bose any day.\n\nIf any of you are looking for a good set of multimedia speakers then look no further.

117;104.0;5.0;9.0;4358;"When I built my computer in the middle of last year, it was designed to be a gaming rig.  Of course I'd use it for the occasional term paper, and a bit of this and that - but gaming was my concern.  After spending $1900 on this behemoth I figured that the crappy media speakers I had from an old system could hold me until I wanted to spend the money to buy new ones.\n\nSo I waited, and a couple months later I decided that I was tired of the terrible sound quality I got from these speakers while playing Halo and NFS: MW (and just about everything else).  Being as I have an Audigy 2ZS Platinum audio card (in laymans terms, it'll feed to a LOT of speakers), I started looking at the 7.1 speaker systems.  I figured ""the more speakers, the better"" - right?  I realized that I'd be spending around $300 for a Logitech 7.1 system once I factored shipping and everthing else.  Then I had another epiphany - where in that 12x16 room (with the computer desk in the corner, the recliner in the other corner, the treadmill on the opposite side, a long dresser on a different side, and an oak rocking chair squeezed in for good measure) am I supposed to put 7 speakers?!  Wall mounting brackets perhaps?  So I'd spend the monetary equavalent to an arm and part of a leg on brackets, not to mention the time involved (and the probability of a screwup regarding holes in the walls - walls which don't belong to me, by the way).\n\nSo, after the cruel reality regarding the practically of my coveted 7.1 system set in, I began to look at smaller sets of speakers.  This one jumped out at me at first because of the sheer power of the speakers.  Initially my first thought was that these speakers cost $150 and all the other ""decent"" 2.1 systems cost around $40.  What was the difference?  Most computer speakers you'll run across are media speakers - good for listening to bird sounds out of your encyclopedia, and okay for listening to some music (very softly).  The Promedia 2.1 system is not a set of media speakers - it is much closer to being a small home audio system that you might hook up to your DVD player.\n\nObviously, I bought these speakers.  And I am not one bit disappointed with the performance I've received for my money.  Any sound that comes out of these speakers has a thickness to it that seems to fill the air.  Whether its some dance music, the revving of a turbocharged import, or the sound a rapid fire laser, they all sound better coming out of these speakers from Klipsch than from any of the mid-level 2.1 systems I've tried.\n\nThe sounds are always crisp.  The power of the speakers\sub is amazing - with the sub and speakers turned up only 1/3 of the way, the pictures on the living room wall (about 20 feet away) start to rattle and jump.\n\nThe only thing to note about these speakers\sub is that for the first couple of weeks the sound will be a little strained.  This is normal.  Give it a little time - your speakers have to get broken in a bit.  Also, your sub will get kinda hot.  Not ""steeping tea while I'm playing video games"" hot - but definately warmer than you'd expect.  Surprisingly, though, this hasn't caused any problems for me.\n\nAll in all, if you're a bit short on space (or too lazy to string wire around a room), these speakers will be a good fit for you.  They give enough power and clarity that you'll be satisfied whether you want them for music or for games.  Currently, they're being sold for about $120 - you'd spend much more if you bought home audio speakers w/sub to hook into your computer.  And would receive similar results.\n\nBottom line, spend the bit of extra money on this system and you won't regret it.";High End Sound From a 2.1 System
118;21.0;2.0;42.0;4392;Yes, these speakers are as great as they are made out to be in terms of sound.  However, two weeks after I bought my first pair, the left speaker went out.  After checking all the wiring and messing around with it, I realized that the speaker worked fine, it just wasn't recieving any signals from the sub.  So I took them back and replaced them with another pair.  The ones I have now have worked great for a year, but now the same thing is happening again.  No signal coming from the sub to the left speaker.  I am just getting tired of having to replace these, because they are really wonderful sounding speakers.  I don't want to get a different pair, but I will because I don't feel like going through this everytime I get a set of these.;I'm torn
119;152.0;5.0;5.0;4403;These speakers are excellent beyond words! I got these from Best Buy last night and these work great. The subwoofer power in this speaker set is powerful. I got it turned on only halfway and the bass is almost too much! This set offers superb sound for music, movies and games(which I haven't tested yet but soon will). However, after testing it a few minutes ago, I give anyone wanting to buy it a warning. Maybe not to you but to the people you live with... These are not sleepers! You will probably find the headphone jack on the right side of the right sattelite to be your best friend. You can't listen to these audibly when other people are sleeping. Yes, they're that good. Because I live with other people the volume and bass will probably always be at modest levels. But if your whole family wants to watch a movie from your computer, these are the ones you want! Music sounds awesome even at low volumes. Even better when kranked up! My movie center is complete with these! Thanks Klipsch! I got what I paid for!;Great Speakers!
120;92.0;5.0;10.0;4406;"I am on my second set of these within a month. Almost couldn't believe my ears when I heard them. I have always thought I knew ""really really good"" when I heard it...and these are. I heard everything I could find in stores and nothing really touched these. These speakers are true in the sound range that most music is made.\n\nbad news is delicacy. I bumped the cable that connects the cable to the subwoofer (from the control speaker). Nothing I could do. Problem was that after hearing them I was hooked, I knew I had to have them on my system.\n\nBuy them, handle them carefully. Spray a little silicon lubricant on the connections so you don't have sticky plugs. Handle gently.\n\nLeave them where they work and leave them alone. Connect power strip to subwoofer so you don't have to crawl around on the floor to turn the power off.\n\nthese are worth the trouble. Wonderfully true and clean speakers.\n\nBernie in corpus";fabulous......and delicate
121;122.0;5.0;7.0;4411;I must admit that some of the reviews of longevity of these speakers was a bit intimidating, but I decided to try them.  I'm glad I did.  These speakers ROCK!!!  They sound better than my Cerwin Vegas in the living room.  Now, I prefer to watch certain movies on my computer(Mac dual 1.8 G5, 23 inch apple cinema display), than my 40 inch sony wega TV.  Music has taken on a new dimension as I hear parts of songs I have never heard before.  Amazing sound.  I won't repeat all the other positives found in other reviews, but I agree with them.  I highly recommend this system.;Amazing!!!
122;24.0;4.0;41.0;4412;"Since I moved I've had to suffer...and that's not an exaggeration, listening to my CDs through a Sony Discman and Altec Lansing ACS44 2.1 speakers.\n\nIt was torture listening to the horn section on Rickie Lee Jones' Pirates CD. It was like nails on a blackboard. Very harsh sounding. I never remembered it sounding like that on my audio system I left back home. But, when I plugged the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 into the Discman and played Rickie Lee Jones...oh my! The horns were smooth, not harsh. Rickie's voice was mellow. I could discern individual voices and instruments on the loud passages. These loud passages sounded like mush on the Altecs.\n\nI have a broad range in musical taste. So, next I put in some Classical. Beethoven's String Quartets performed by Quartetto Italiano. I could really hear those rosin laden bows grabbing at those strings. On good recordings you can hear this with decent audio gear. This is one of the criteria besides horns I use when listening for how well the speakers can resolve audio detail in the mid and upper ranges. Other criteria are cymbals; they should sound smooth, not tinny...sort of a ""psh psh"" as opposed to a ""tzz tzz"". On the Klipsch cymbals sound like ""psh psh"" like they're supposed to. Cymbals linger and float in the air now. That's something that never happened with the Altecs.\n\nThese are quite revealing and detailed speakers. Hook in a different CD player and you'll really hear a noticeable difference. The quality of the recordings will come through on these speakers. Good recordings will sound good and mediocre records will sound mediocre. These speakers will not make John Fogerty's voice on CCR's Cronicle 20 Greatest Hits CD any more tolerable unfortunately, but neither will just about any other good set of speakers. Instruments and notes that I didn't notice before on my old system or totally missing on the Altecs are revealing themselves again and anew. Some say the tweeters are overly bright. Perhaps. These speakers are on the bright side but not overly so in my opinion. And if they are bright it's not harsh. I can listen to these speakers all day at moderately loud levels. Can't say the same for some other hi-fi speakers I've heard before. I could only listen to 1 or 2 CDs on the Altecs before I gave up.\n\nThe Klipsch Promedias do a great job on vocals too. Raiatea Helm's voice sounded more ""Sweet and Lovely"" (the title of her latest Hawaiian CD) on the Klipsch than on the Altecs. If you love listening to female vocals you HAVE to get Raiatea's CD!\n\n***Since 1/10/06 I've learned that Raiatea's CD has been nominated for a Grammy in Category 70, Best Hawaiian Music Album\n(Vocal or Instrumental.)!***\n\nBass is good too. Good detail and extension, though a bit vague. This trait, I've found, is common with small diameter, ported woofers. It's also a bit weighty. I keep the bass adjustment for the subwoofer all the way down. Any setting higher than that and it overpowers the mids and highs. Placing the subwoofer outside and away from corners and walls and slightly to the left of your listening position is probably best. You will have to experiment on placement and level settings to find what works best in your environment and for your taste. Everyone's room and ears are different. Just walking around the room or moving slightly toward or away from the subwoofer unit will change the sound of it. After fiddling with my subwoofer placement I found having it about two feet out from the back wall and two feet out from the side wall, but just inside the left satellite is ideal for me. Placing it more toward the center of the satellites caused a lack of lower mids and upper bass. Cellos sounded anemic when the sub was placed in the center. Just off to the left and cellos sound much much better.\n\nThe stereo imaging and soundstage is head and shoulders above the Altecs! When I put on Laurie Anderson's ""Home of the Brave"" live CD and turned up the volume I really felt like I was in the concert hall. And how's this? The Klipsch's imaging is so good it fooled my cat's sensitive ears! I was listening to Eagles' Greatest Hits Vol. 2 and 'Heartache Tonight' ends with a series of drum beats. My cat was sitting in my lap, facing me and these drum beats caused him to turn his head back in the direction he thought they came from. He directed his head and ears to the outside of the right speaker where even I thought they were coming from! With the Altecs I could always pinpoint that the instruments were coming from the satellites.\n\nNow for the negatives. First off the Tractrix tweeters are taken from the high end models which are priced in the $1000s which is a plus, and although they have very good lateral dispersion they have a real lack of vertical dispersion. This being the case it's very important to set the satellites at ear level for the best treble detail and sound. The speakers are normally tilted up on their stands. The thinking is they'll be placed on the computer desk below ear level. But it would've been nice if Klipsch had designed adjustable stands that could be tilted up or down. The Altec satellites can be tilted up or down. You could remove the stands and bend them so the speakers are more vertical and I may have to do this with my set up. I have the speakers set up on a counter between my kitchen and living area of my apartment and when I sit to listen the tweeters and mid range drivers are pointing up slightly. This is enough to cause a lack of clarity in the upper ranges. When I stand up from my seated position I notice a definite change...and it's better. However, like most people I like to sit while I listen to music, not stand!\n\nIt would be best to use stands to adjust the height of the speakers, but don't get the ones they sell on Klipsch's website. Instead get a pair of Sanus EFSatb (black) or EFSats (silver) and bolt the Klipsch stock stands to them using one of the Sanus' brackets. The Sanus stands are better than the ones Klipsch sells because the tubes are bigger and the base is cast iron. The Sanus is more sturdy than the Omnimounts that Klipsch sells. On Amazon's website the Sanus' are cheaper than the Klipsch stands too...by almost half!\n\nWhile you can order a Monster Cable speaker cable kit from Klipsch (something I highly recommend). It would've been really nice if Klipsch designed the satellites with regular speaker cable connections rather than mini jacks. This way you could upgrade the stock speaker cables with any brand speaker cables you want. And it would've been really really cool if Klipsch incorporated binding posts to connect the speaker cables instead of the usual cheap clips.\n\nWhile you can connect your CD or MP3 source through the mini jack on the control preamp you need to use adapters if you want to use your favorite interconnect cables. Again, it would've been really cool if Klipsch designed the control preamp with a pair of RCA jacks.\n\nThese are all nit picks of course as these are designed and marketed for use with computers. Still, it would've been nice if Klipsch designed these with the audiophile in mind. And I'll tell you why. While an audiophile has his/her main audio equipment in the living room this setup would be great in a den, bedroom, rec room or garage.\n\nWant to have a cheap, but truly good if not great sounding little hi-fi system? Hook up a nice, yet inexpensive CD player from NAD, Adcom, etc. with good interconnect cables from Kimber Kable, Rega, Tara Labs or Synergistic Research using adapters...get the Monster Cable kit from Klipsch (wish they had better) and you'll have one nice little sound system.\n\nThis is what I'm planning to do exactly. I need to build my sound system from scratch again and this is a good starting point as I can't get all the components all at once...I'm not rich after all. I'm planning on getting a Jolida JD100 vacuum tube CD player and hooking it up to these Klipsch with good interconnects for the time being. This combination will work just fine as I feel these little ""computer"" speakers are up the to task and worthy of something like the Jolida CDP. Then, I'll get Jolida's 1501RC tube/solid state hybrid integrated amp...and then a pair of Magnepan MG12s...then I'll really be in music heaven! Until then the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 will satisfy me.\n\n***Since writing this review I've found out that Kimber Kable makes cables with a pair of RCA connectors on one end and a mini plug on the other...or, if you want to hook up your iPod or portable CD player they make a cable with mini plugs on both ends. And, Synergistic Research will be coming out with cables for iPod (I'm guessing mini to mini and mini to RCA cables). So NO ADAPTERS NEEDED! These cables will be a huge step up, from top to bottom, in musical detail and extension over the built in cable or anything you can get from Radio Shack or similar store.***\n\n***Okay, another addition to my already long review, but this is very noteworthy. If you really want to hear what these speakers can do you HAVE TO get the Monster Cable kit. Not having the patience to wait for the Monster Cable 2.1 set to be in stock on Klipsch's website I went ahead and ordered the set for the Promedia 4.1s and installed the shorter 15ft. pair to my Promedia 2.1s.\n\nWell, as expected upper end detail improved greatly. With the stock speaker cables the speakers could barely resolve the cymbal beats on Pink Floyd's 'Comfortably Numb'. They're very subtle, but they are there. But, with the Monster Cables the cymbals are resolved very well. Nora Jones' voice really opened up on her 'Come Away With Me' CD. Before it was good, but always seemed constrained, boxed in even. I thought it was the recording, but the Monster Cables really helped her voice on this CD. But the last thing I thought the Monster Cables would do is IMPROVE BASS DETAIL. After all the cables feed the satellites and the sub is on its own needing no cable hook ups aside from the power and DIN from the control preamp right? As I sat there dumbfounded but enjoying the increased detail in bass I thought, the mid range drivers on the satellites are responsible for the lower mid-range and the upper bass...and this is where the increased detail is, but this also helps define the lower bass too. Also, from what I've read elsewhere another way to increase bass detail is to raise the subwoofer off the floor. I would recommend something inexpensive like Herbie's Isolation feet at:\n\n[...]\n\nThis will be my next upgrade for these great sounding little speakers.***";Best 2.1 computer speakers out there.
123;67.0;5.0;14.0;4414;These speakers rock!  Look at the reviews by other people!  What these other audophiles have written remains true for me as well.\n\nI had a pair of Altec Lansing speakers for the past 10 years.  They were good (at 27 watts, they weren't great) but I was ready to update to something better. I don't have room for surround sound with 5.1 speakers, so I knew I needed a 2.1 set.  Klipsch has been making speakers and audio products for a long time, so it is a brand you can trust.  After reading these reviews and finding them on sale on Amazon, I bought them (I would keep checking Amazon to see their prices - they change from time to time and I bought mine when they were on sale with free shipping).\n\nI set them up at home, got them ready and put a CD into my computer.  It came out loud. It came out clear.  And the bass rattled my wall, pictures, and my bones.  I have had other fantastic stereo systems before - in my car, TV surround sound, etc.  However, I have never heard bass match the music so cleanly.  On lesser speakers, you will hear music from the sattellites and every once and a while, you will hear a thump from the bass, like it just needs to thump to make sure it is working.  The ProMedia 2.1 speakers are different. The subwoofer has an exit tube for the bass sound and a covered speaker for additional sound.  Which means that when you are listening to music, sound comes out of the two satellites and the subwoofer and the same time, blending the bass and music perfectly.  I think that is what impressed me the most. Yes, you can make these speakers extremely loud. Yes, you can turn the bass up high enough to bring down a small building.  Yes, your vision will blur if you put your head near the subwoofer while its on.  All of those things are impressive, but I think the fact that it matches the music so perfectly makes these speakers the best on the market.\n\nI also tested a DVD, Star Wars Episode 2, since the speakers are THX certified. I used the scene when Jenga Fett chases Obi-Wan throught the asteroid field. Since it is only two speakers, the directional ability of the sound is not as effective - in this case, the movie sounds better on my TV surround sound set. But for computer speakers, the ProMedia speaker sounded great. I would have no problem watching movies on my computer knowing that I was getting high quality sound. And since that subwoofer is kicking out so much bass, you can feel the explosions in the movie.\n\nAs for games, which is really what I use my computer for, there is no comparison.  Other speakers in this price range don't stand a chance in terms of sound quality, clarity, bass and range.  I started playing some levels in Half-Life 2, and indeed there are things I have never heard before.  There are birds chirping in the background in some level!  But the best thing is that these speakers handled the sound of a bird just as well has it handled the sound of my shotgun blasting an explosive barrel.  Everything just sounded so good. I tried other games and each one sounded better than anything else I have ever heard on my computer.  The speakers have made a big difference in my game playing experience.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend these speakers.  I don't update my computer hardware very often, but when I do, I make sure to get the best.  These speakers will change you computer listening experience.  They will handle any media - CD, DVD, and games.  They will do so any way you wish - you can adjust the subwoofer all the way to off if you perfer not to destroy your apartment.  This speaker set is capable of handling anything you want.  You won't be sorry if you use these speakers.  Buy. Setup. Enjoy.;Loud has been redefined!
124;140.0;4.0;6.0;4428;Some of the horror stories written by a couple of reviewers scared me, but I still went ahead and purchased the speakers.  First off, if you're going to buy these speakers go to Klipsch's site and order the Monster Cable 2.1 cable kit.  They're worth it and I can tell a noticeable difference in clarity (especially at higher ranges) compared to the flimsy cables that come with the speakers.  Everything that comes out of these speakers sounds phenomenal and they do take a while to reach normal operating parameters (it's weird they require a break in period).  You really start to notice a difference in sound quality when you turn the speakers up a quarter turn.  I think at lower volumes there isn't enough power to drive the speakers and sub-woofer properly so it might be something you want to take into consideration if have quiet hours in your dorm for example.  Also, Klipsch was smart enough to put the headphone and input jacks on the speaker.  The whole input idea into the speaker system was brilliant because you can hook up your iPod and listen to your music that way.\n\nI'm still a little skeptical if the upgrade from my old speakers was worth it and a few of the horror stories still have me spooked, but I have faith in Klipsch for the time being.  If you spend some serious time listening to music, playing videogames, or watching DVDs then look no further.  However, if you don't really care about the best product out there then look for a more reasonable system offered by other manufactures.\n\nNote: I have a Yamaha YMF753 sound card which may sound like junk compared to a high performance cards such as Creative's Audigy product line.\n\n***Update***\nI upgraded my soundcard to a Soundblaster Live! 24-Bit External and the speakers produce cleaner, louder, and richer music.  The speaker system has the amazing ability to emit high frequencies flawlessly and the sub-woofer is not out of control with the bass production.  The left speaker sounds a tad quieter than the right speaker, but that could my subjective hearing.  The failure rate of Klipsch systems still has me worried, but I'm guessing a few people either had bad luck or are abusing their speakers.;excellent so far...

126;112.0;5.0;8.0;4454;These 2.1 speakers are among the best 2.1 speakers available.  They are a proven product, having been on the market for over 4 years.  The highs are very crisp and clear, and the bass is adjustable to your preference.  Some complain that the horn tweaters provide too high-piercing sound, everyone's hears sound differently, but this was definitely not a problem for me.  The precise highs and lows don't muffle the mids at all.  The mids are very crisp.  Vocals aren't over-emphasized, as on other brands.  It is  a perfect balance of sound.  The only negative on these speakers is the cost.  They are quite expensive, but in my opinion they are well worth the price.  Having to work for my money I know how important the cost of these 'extras' are.  But, if you listen to music on your computer a lot, or just like high-quality sound these are definitely for you.

129;80.0;4.0;11.0;4476;[...]\n\n As a recent all-digital convert (no huge components, no CD loading, etc), I'm completely stoked with this purchase. The subwoofer is ridiculously adequate and the satellites, while ugly as sin (but also very plain and not gimmicky) seem to have been designed to actually produce sounds other than booming bass. That's the problem with a ton of speakers out there - they're designed for power, not accuracy. Klipsch put some effort into making computer speakers sound just as good as those in your home or car, evidenced by the ProMedia actually having its own tweeters. There's no substitute for having a dedicated driver for crisp highs instead of that all-in-one driver that Logitech, et al, use.\n\n If you want to blow up your house, the ProMedia is for you. But also, the sound is CLEAR. You can throw bass at me until the cows come home, but if there's no fidelity, it's just annoying. Plus, I'm an apartment dweller, which means that having QUALITY sound is much more important than POWERFUL sound. Either way, you get both with these speakers.\n\n The only problem I'm having now is that these things really expose flaws that you might have with your mp3s (128 kps). But that's what good speakers do - faithfully pronounce the signal source.\n\n[...];For the market, they're perfect

I've had these speakers for 4 years now (Got them in may 2001) and here's a list of pros and cons i've notice over the years:\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Awesome sound quality and ANY volume.  I have maxxed the volume on these speakers once, and i'd say they put out around 95dB.  Hard to say exactly, since I wasn't exactly sober at the time, but i'd say definitally over 90dB, but under 100dB.  Of course there was some distortion at that volume, but it was definitally still listenable (if you call that volume listenable in the first place...).  Of course this depends on the source, too.  An Audigy 2 will sound better than your AC97 onboard codec.  FYI, I rock these speakers with the nvidia soundstorm onboard audio.\n\nPoint is, they'll go as loud as you could ever ask and sound great doing it.\n\n2)  Nice looking speakers overall.  The grills easily come off the satillites, revealing that trademark klipsch horn.\n\n3) Wired with actual speaker wire, not coaxial plugs like most other computer speakers.  I'm no expert, but common sense dictates that this provides a better signal (seperate wires from +\- vs. in the same wire).  The fact that they plug into the satillites with a 1/8"" plug kinda sucks, but I would think it doesn't make much of a difference.\n\n4) Wires are plenty long.  You can put these almost anywhere.\n\nCONS (mostly minor things):\n\n1) Preamp.  There's a reason klipsch sells replacement preamps.  Plan on getting a new one after about 3 years.  The volume control knobs get loose, and I started to get some serious crackling on volume adjustment.  Replaced the preamp for like 20-25 bucks and it was as good as new, though.\n\n2) Fit and finish.  After a couple years, the plastic coating stuff on the sub/amp started to bubble off mine on the edges.  No big deal for me, but worth noting.\n\n3) Speaker wire.  I know I listed this under pros, also.  While the fact that the wires hook up the amp via normal speak wire connections, the included wire could have definitally been a thicker gage, especially considering their length.  You can get the moster cable kit for these speakers, which might help you get more effeciency out of them.\n\nI give these 5 starts because for the money, you can't find better sound quality and volume.  From what I understand, logitech's high end 2.1 system is comparable to these, but I have no idea since i've never heard them.  I know logi does have good speakers, but I really don't see them topping these 2.1's.\n\n***UPDATE 5/17/2012***\nWell, these speakers have finally given up the ghost.  All total I replaced the preamp maybe 2-3 times over the life of the speakers due to the crackling issue mentioned in my initial review.  What caused them to finally die was that I started getting loud popping noises from the subwoofer that kept getting worse.  Initially it would come and go, but eventually go away.  Finally it wouldn't go away and kept getting worse.  I'm assuming it's an issue in the amp somewhere, as it happened with the unit turned on but nothing playing.  I'm not going to replace these with another set of Klipsch, as I've heard that the quality on these units has gone down since they started selling them at Best Buy.  However, they're still probably the best speakers at their new ~$150 price point, but I don't want to deal with the russian roulette of their quality.  Because of this, I've dropped the rating from 5 starts to 4 stars.";Not going to jump on the fanboy bandwagon...
132;82.0;5.0;11.0;4618;"In a previous review, I had stated that there was a problem with the bass, and that my old SOUNDSTICKS were, infact, better. I gave the product 3 stars under the heading, ""NOT FOR MUSIC!!!"" The bass seemed very thumpy and well, noteless, like there weren't notes in the bass lines, just thumps.\n\nBoy was I wrong -\n\nIt appears that the sub or speakers require some time to WARM UP/ BURN IN. Becuase 30 minutes after I had written that review, I came back into my room to hear BEAUTIFUL, FULL, and RICH music coming from these speakers. I couldn't beleive my ears. I was about ready to pack them back in the box and take them back. Now, however, it seems as if i can almost hear the speakers getting better with every note that is pumped out of them. They fill my room with sound beautifully and i wouldn't trade them for anything. Even at low volumes they sound great.\n\n**I have tried the LOGITECH Z-2300s and returned them. MUSICALLY, They DO NOT COMPARE to these, except for mere power and spaciousness. I consider myself somewhat of an audiphile, and trust me, for MUSIC, these are the ones.\n\nJust make sure you purchase some sort of protection plan or extended warranty as these seem to have a reputation for crapping out a little early (see 1 star ratings).";Better than Logitech z2300!!!

134;125.0;3.0;7.0;4794;I've had these for several years and also a pair of Ribbon Planar speaker. The now defunct Monsoon MM1000. I will take a ribbon planar speaker any day over conventional paper cone speakers. While the Klipsch 2.1 have an average quality, in other words they have a broad stereo image. They just are a bit slow. On the other hand the Monsoon MM1000 being a flat ribbon planar speaker have an extremely fast response and a pinpoint stereo image. Move off that center and the stereo image falls flat. Unlike the Klipsh 2.1 the image remains but just isn't as sweet a s the MM1000. You could do worse than the Klipsch but you can also do better.;They are decent... but just adequate
135;155.0;4.0;5.0;4810;"I have had my Promedias (5.1) for almost 3 years now. I can tell you these are the best sounding PC speakers out there, everything is incredibly clear, crisp, smooth. Before this I have had many other speakers and there is a very noticeable difference in audio quality with these. (you do need a good sound card, please don't buy them for anything else than Sound Blaster Audigy IMHO - cards are quite inexpensive nowadays). With 500 Watts you are looking at serious power, and I have never had to go to higher volume settings. With my Audigy card (it is in fact obsolete, the Audigy 2 has been out awhile) I get amazingly good sound from my music CD's as well as computer games. Note that these are not digital but analog, but I would say it does not matter because they sound better than any other speaker out there, digital or not. (these are also wonderful if you like watching DVD's on your PC's DVD-ROM drive, the crispness of the sound will blow you away)\n\nThere is one, and only one issue - my subwoofer, which is indeed the central point of the system, conked out shortly after 2 years. This appears to be a very known, common issue with the older versions of Promedias (I got mine in Jan 2002). I had to send this to Klipsch for repairs, $60 flat price. Klipch claims that the new Promedia Ultra does not have this ""bug"". The problem has not recurred so I hope this fix makes the speakers last another two years at the least.";Almost perfect PC speakers

137;99.0;3.0;10.0;4844;These sound incredible.  I have had my set for 2 years.  Today the amp died.  A check of many online forums indicates this is nothing new.  In fact, many people experience the same problem at right around the 2-year mark.  So, if you want to spend close to $400 for speakers that sound wonderful for about 2 years, you can't beat Klipsch.  I however will be giving some Logitech Z-5500s a try...;Great Sound BUT.......
138;37.0;3.0;26.0;4853;"I am kicking myself for not starting with these speakers in the first place.  After buying an Altec-Lansing 2.1 system with no mid-range and a constant sub woofer hum, I decided to increase my budget.  While I can't say that I like the look of the satellites as much as I liked the compact Altect-Lansings, there is no arguing with how they sound...which can be summed up in one word - wow.\n\nThese speakers have no bass and treble controls...and they do not need them.  The mix is perfect regardless of source. They do, however, have a subwoofer bass level control mounted on one of the satellites, which allows you to tone things down for late night DVD viewing...while keeping the base on the satellites intact.\n\nSo, what's not to like? Well, not much frankly...but here there are a few features that I would like to see refined.\n\n- The wiring is hokey.  I really wish that the input source went into the sub and that each satellite had only a single wire connecting it to the sub (a common design for other 2.1 systems).  Instead, the control satellite has three wires exiting the back of the satellite - a flimsy speaker wire, a hard-wired input source line, and a hard-wired control line to the sub.  Also, as mentioned, the stereo wire that connects both sats to the sub is both flimsy and, further exacerbating matters, custom...featuring a 3.5mm stereo plug on one end and bare wire (meant for sub-mounted dual clips) on the other.  Many users eventually report static with this setup after time and end up replacing the wiring.\n\n- The power switch is on the back of the sub...not on the control satellite.\n\n- The grills, while not completely unattractive, could be refined.  That said, take them off and these speakers look pretty cool.\n\nAdmittedly, some of those complaints may be picky, but this is a mid price range multimedia 2.1 speaker system so I expected better...especially with regards to the  wiring.  That said, the sound is stellar...so four stars.  When Klipsch works out a couple of those other issues...or cuts the price in half...then I will award that elusive fifth star.  :-)\n\n===========================\n\nFebruary 2012 UPDATE...and a WARNING:\n\nEight years have passed since I wrote my original review and Amazon is still listing this product.  In fact, the product is still selling well. Unfortunately, it is NOT the same product...even though it shows up under the same Amazon listing.\n\nThe old Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 was a very high quality set.  Thus, it was very popular.  So what did Klipsch do?  Guess.\n\nThe sub now weighs 5 pounds less...FIVE.  Does it matter?  Seems so, since folks who have owned both this version and the old version state that the bass is no longer beautifully integrated into the sound profile with the sats.  Now it is fairly ""boomy.""\n\nWell, how about that hokey wiring that I noted 8 years ago.  Did they improve it?  No,  in fact, it's worse.  The speaker wire that comes out of the back of EACH sub (and that must EACH travel to the sub) is now hardwired.  Klipsch claims that this change is an improvement.  Many of us disagree.\n\nWhat else?  Well, for years people complained that the sats didn't have a power switch and that you had to use the switch on the sub to power the system off.  So what did Klipsch do?  They removed the power switch from the sub.  You now need to unplug the sub to turn the system off.  Yes, unplug.\n\nWhat's worse is that the price now ranges from the old price (~$150) to well over $200.\n\n---\n\nSo should you buy this system?  Well, that's a tough call.  Frankly, while the system seems to have gone down a few notches, it is still probably a far better option than most 2.0 systems.  You just can't get decent bass with small drivers...regardless of what folks try to sell you.\n\nUnfortunately, gone are the days when you could go to a local B&M and audition a full aisle of computer speakers.  Perhaps that's due to falling profit margins at B&Ms, the need to diversify at such outlets, or the fact that many people now use laptops instead of desktops.  Regardless, the situation remains - you must now rely on online reviews and roll the dice.  Reviews like this one.  ;)\n\nIn my opinion, this system is probably not a bad option if you can find it for ~$150, but I wouldn't pay any more.  If you had the old version, you'll probably be disappointed even if you can find it for that price.  Personnaly, if I was looking today, I would probably spend 100 beans more and get a 2.1 Swan M50W system...and tell Klipsch to stick their ""improvements"" ;)";UPDATED REVIEW - February 2012
139;48.0;1.0;21.0;5063;The plus side is it,s easy to hook this good looking ,so called new generation of sound ,THX pro media experiance set up,up. I had read the reveiws about great sound,people getting kicked out of apartments,powering up a block party,the works. I put the old Altec Lansings ATP3,s on my other P.C. Carefully adjusted my sound card,even played a subwoofer break in disc I had around. Talk about dissapointment. My 89 dollar boom box would put these to shame. There is still no system out for p.c.s that I'd call head and shoulders above the rest. If you think these have great sound quality you have obviously lived a sheltered life. The tweeters are obnoxious in my opinion,but I'm a silk dome fan! The bass isn't really that great either. Very minamal change in volume over the old Altec Lansing ATP3s\nPay attention to the people with reliability issues and service from Klipsch too! When they say poor service They are being nice. It will take awhile to get your return authorization number. You will need this number,BECAUSE OF RELIABILITY ISSUES and if you bought them from someone other than a authorized dealer they will want you to pay. Looking back I bought thses speaker because of the name is synonimous with fine audio equipment. I only looked at the positive reviews,figured the others didn't know what they were talking about,wrong. Just like the dim headlights on a old Volkswagon,once again Bosch is not a electrical genius on this player. Dont, I repeat dont, buy this system expecting to just smoke your old set up unless you have one crappy o.e.m. setup. Just think in-between sending it back for service to Klipsch your going to need something to listen too so don't throw them out.;Ignore the hype,its from people trying to sell these turds.
140;14.0;1.0;72.0;5065;Within the last two years I have bought two sets of the Promedia 2.1 speakers based on the reputation of the company, and several excellent reviews on the web.  They remind me of my old VW rabbit.  When it worked it was an awesome car, but it had one problem after another.  The same can be said for these speakers.  The subs on both sets failed, and got severely distorted sound.  The quality of these speakers has spoken for themselves.  ****CHEAP****  They obviously have a serious reliability problem, as suggested by many other customer's reviews, but what is worse, after spending $350 on the two sets, Klipsch will not recall them, and wants me to spend another $40 each to fix the subwoofers.  That's great customer service.  Don't buy this junk.  I have since bought a set of Logitech z-2200 speakers (THX rated) for about $100 and could not be happier.  They are built much better, and sound fantastic.;KLIPSCH HAS RUINED THEIR REPUTATION WITH PROMEDIA SPEAKERS!!
141;70.0;1.0;14.0;5133;I am very much into clarity and fullness of sound, not a ton of  volume or bass. Based on reviews, I thought these would make an excellent replacement to my Boston Acountics BA4800 that have served me well for 2 years (in 2.1 mode). Setup was easy, the clarity was on par with the Bostons, and had the fullness I was looking for despite an exceptionally odd preference to play the right speaker at almost twice the volume of the left.  OK fine, maybe a software problem? I adjust to correct and I am now a happy man... for less than an hour. The amp fried itself and I am forced to teardown, repack, reinstall the 4800s and try again for [a lot more money]?\nI don't think so - the Klipsch might have a slight edge on sound fullness, but not a oost [more money] plus serious quality problems.\n\nSave your money and get something better.\n\n2008 Edit:\nI bought the Harman Kardon soundsticks II a little while after returning these.  Been 3+ years now and NO problems.  They look a little too trendy but they sound great and have been bulletproof.  Check em out if you can find them.;Good sound, horrible reliability
142;142.0;3.0;6.0;5234;I received my speakers a month ago and the sound quality is greater than my previous altec lansings.  My big complaint though is the line connections between the sub and speakers.  They don't seem to make a perfect connection and if moved, I either lose sound in the speaker, the sound dims, or get crackling.  Not sure if others have had this problem.;Good sound, but is there quality?
143;93.0;4.0;11.0;5332;"I am very happy with the Klipsch Promedia 2.1. I read as many reviews as I could before purchasing, considering the GMX A-2.1 among others. I really had Klipsch in mind because of their track record and the raving reviews. It definitely performs and has plenty of power (much to spare). I cannot speak so much to the quality because I do not have a trained ear for intense listening. All I can say is that it sounded way better than my old speakers ($$ computer show piece of junk). I also own the Logitech z-560 THX 4.1 system for my computer at school. Comparing the two, it seems like the klipsch system has more power (both have plenty to spare). I assume that having a separate tweeter improves the quality of the highs, but I couldn't really hear a difference. Also, the Klipsch gives you more control over the subwoofer. When i turn the subwoofer down on the Klipsch, it is very close to off, when I turn the bass control down on the Logitech, the subwoofer is still booming. The Klipsch system is fairly easy to set up. The lack of bare end wires (the Klipsch has a mini jack on the speaker end) might turn some users off. Doesn't really bother me. The price of the system is a real hit to the checking account, and I'm not even sure it's worth it. For $$ more I could have purchased the z-560's again. Alas, no room for it and no 5.1 sound card for this. This system will be overkill for most users, but if you like big sound without distortion and you have some money to spend, here is your system. Gamers should probably get a 5.1 system by Klipsch (Promedia, not GMX) or Logitech. You can read plenty of technical reviews (with fancy graphs and numbers and jargon like ""soundstage"") online. They all proclaim the Klipsch promedia 2.1 the standard by which every other 2.1 Computer Speaker system is measured. Design wise, these aren't exactly sexy, but not hideous or out of date either. They are quite large, larger than the Logitech sattelites. I recommend these speakers to the buyer not on a tight budget who listens to a lot of music. I don't recommend these speakers to gamers or buyers who want to watch DVDs because of the lack of 5.1. Just for the heck of it, I've also seen/heard a klipsch promedia 5.1 setup (probably playing stereo mode) broadcast to an entire street block. It wasn't anythign close to a concert, but if it's enough to travel that far with clarity, it's certainly enough to fill up a room.";Great sound, Steep Price
144;110.0;1.0;9.0;5353;Before I purchased the speakers, I had been looking online and reading reviews for over a month. I decided to buy Klipsch speakers which received usually 5 stars except in a few cases. I purchased them directly from the Klipsch website, because I thought I would get the newest ones (the initial series had a design flaw), but I was wrong. I waited almost a month for them and when I finally received them they were working for only 15 minutes and then broke down!!! They were not abused in any way nor exposed to extreme conditions. I do not know to this day how a[n expensive] system can perform so badly. It's like you bought a Mercedes Benz which had a Ford reliability. It turned out that the design flaw was not fixed (the subwoofer amplifier is very likely to fail prematurely). Although I called Klipsch that I want a refund, they sent me another pair, but this time I returned them again without even trying, but It took me three months and about 30 telephone calls before I finally got my money back, I had to threaten them with a lawyer, otherwise I doubt I would ever get anything back. The customer service was so bad that is not even worth describing. I found out later that these speakers are not actually made by Klipsch but by someone else for Klipsch, hence the poor reliability. Anyway, If you want to spend that much money on a computer sound system, consider some other brand, I suggest Logitech.;Great expectations, huge disappointment!
145;133.0;5.0;7.0;5395;With my new PC, I just had to go all out on speakers.  My last set of speakers were both 2.1 Altec Lansing's.  I wanted more power - and surround sound for the games.  I went in search of the best speakers at the elctronic stores... all the other 5.1's were... alright.  However, the Klipsch's were just unparalled.  I read some of the other reviews on here before I got them, most bad reviews were in refrence to breakage.  I advise this - be smart.. give them time to be broken in before you blow your ears out.  I gave mine about 20 hours before I turned them up.. well, halfway anyway, that was as much as I could stand :)\nEven then, the clarity was amazing.  The control tower allows center, front, and sub gain.  Therefore, if you need the base handy or what have you, it's right there.\nI can't say how much I love this system.  It also seems to throw the sound farther than I ever expected.. it penetrates the walls like a sledgehammer, so beware :);What else can I say?

It also has both a headphone and auxillary jack (for plugging in a discman or mp3 player) on the right satellite.\nThe 200 watt Klipsch 2.1's will fill even large rooms with huge sound.  The subwoofer can supply huge, booming bass for games and DVDs, and also balanced, musical bass for music.  The satellites, with their 3"" long-throw drivers and separate tweeters, provide clear, accurate sound reproduction.  A word of caution: your 128kbps-encoded mp3s will NOT sound very good, as these speakers will bring to light every pop and flaw of a compressed music file.  Stick to CDs, and you will be in heaven.\nMy minor gripes include the power switch on the back of the subwoofer and the thin speaker wiring.  It is an inconvenience to have to bend over and shut the speakers off, and the speaker wire connection could be better.\nBOTTOM LINE: If you have no reservations about spending a little more on a set of 2.1 computer speakers, these should be your #1 choice.";klipsch: the best multimedia speaker, stateside
147;12.0;5.0;76.0;5489;"Since I bought my first stereo system in the late 1970s, most component purchase decisions have been about looking for the right compromise between performance and price. In this case, the combinations of Klipsch's tradition of great speakers and an in-store audition made me disregard the price point, and --after months of monk-like-denial of other little wants-- plunk down the significant $ these requre. If price is your ONLY consideration, then hese speakers have some excellent competition from Logitech (and soon, from their own company, when the GMX D-5.1 are released in Feb 2003). But: These are equal to --or better-- than best home stereo speakers I've ever owned. And at that level of performance (even with adding of a 5.1 capable sound card if you don't already have one), then these are at a modest price point. Like loud??? Crank 'em up. Not only will you risk your hearing, but you'll be amazed at how damned crisp the sound was just before deafness set in. Issues: The subwoofer is not for confined spaces. The ""control tower"" user interface has some issues (the power button is inexplicably located on its side, and the smaller center/rear/sub adjustment knobs would be improved by either some backlit labels and or a configuration that visually establishes their relationship): these are minor points, but surprising oversights in a speaker system that wil require most of four hundred dollars to buy. But: put in your favorite tunes (interesting note for P2P lovers whose music may be mostly downloaded: Klipsch indicates in their manual that these speakers will reveal the loss of fidelity in the MP3 format. Be prepared!), turn up the volume and all is forgiven. These rock. Period.";If you are allowed one little luxury in life.....

149;105.0;5.0;10.0;5536;After reading all the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give Klipsch a try and purchased it. I followed the suggestion of some reviewers: extended warranty. I have 4 years of that, and it's made in China. No doubt this system beats my Boston Accoustics 7500G, which I still love and keep.\n\n Compare to BA 7500G, Klipsch's satellites have more noise, but it is not noticable unless you get close to them. The subwoofer is what beats off the BA 7500G. It's too strong!! With my Sound Blaster Live!, sometimes I have to turn the subwoofer control on the main satellite to the minimum in order to not disturb my neighbors. Very, very impressive subwoofer power, which is what I'm thirsty for!! The surround volumn of front and back is adjustable and sounds great. When I play ghost recon, if I turn the sound too loud, I am always close to have a heart attack when someone is shooting behind me.\n\n Physically the satellites are pretty large compare to many others, but THEY LOOK GOOD. They just look like some high-price, expensive speakers, which they are. The subwoofer is big and heavy, but who cares about the size when it sounds that good?\n\nI have listened to many computer speaker systems in stores, including logitech, monsoon, creative labs, altec lansing, harman kardon, and so on. I'll have to say altec lansing simply [stinks]. Noise, and the subwoofer always has bumping sound. Harman Kardon on the other hand is really high quality, but too pricy and not common in store. All other systems are just weak compare to Boston Accoustics, not even mentioning this Klipsch system.\n\nBut be aware of what the reviewers tell you, this might break. The first system I brought home simply was broken. No power! I brought it back to circuit city and replaced with a new one, which's been working fine so far.

They sound excellent with hard hitting bass and responsive highs - and that's what's so sad about the situation, because I'm returning my second system now and they're gonna be sending me my third, since they only last about 9 months. When I called this time for a return authorization number, the customer service rep said, ""What's wrong, the subwoofer works but all the other speakers don't?"" They must know about it then. When I got my second system, they said they fixed the problem - obviously not. This is a very expensive system and it gets excellent reviews so the thought of purchasing it is very tempting, but the other reviewers are right, it won't last long, so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that it costs about [$$] for UPS shipping back to the company since its so heavy, with a 2 month turn around time, so factor that into your descision. Although the system can put out alot of power, I don't play my music very loud at all and the system is protected from surges. I think there's a design flaw somewhere. Plus the volume knob is very touchy - going from 10 to 23 to 24 to 35 with the turn of the knob. Not very percise - you'll find yourself turning it back and forth trying to get to where you want to be.

Or, if you survive the  4 - 6 months of normal usage, the amp in the subwoofer prematurely fails (very common occurance-many people are on their 3rd set in a year).

After the third day they started sounding distorted when certain sounds were played(eg. the Earthlink sign on bell, windows bong when a message comes up) The subwoofer wasn't playing the low side of the sounds, the satalites were and they wern't very good. the ""Bass reflex"" doesn't play descretely anymore from my Philips LFE speaker test, it just plays through the front speakers-how (...)is that?- The rear channels played through my two front speakers as well as my left rear. It is not my soundcard because it worked with my other speakers. The wire hook ups with this Promedia 5.1 are flimsy, I never did like contact leads, the subwoofer is not well built and the wires flimsy. The places they plug into on the sub are loose(yes I did check the wires and they were all connected right, it's just the contacts on the sub were flimsy)\nUnless you want to get rid of some extra cash, I would recommend going with a cheaper and better built system.\n*Review update-May 6, 2003*\nYet a third set of these worthless, over-rated, over priced speakers has gone out six months after my initial review.  I will not put up with this.  Klipsh should be ashamed of themselves.  They have just permanantly lost another customer.  I will never buy a Klipsh product again!

153;158.0;5.0;5.0;5625;"For your information, I'm a fan of stereo sets and I've always loved to get the best stereo set available in the market to satisfy my stereo needs.\nFirst of all, I purchased a Altec Lansing 641 from [local store], and when I took it back, I loved the sound system very much as it has a dual speaker sub-woofers, the sound was very clear, but unfortunately after a week, the sub-woofers started to give me some sort of irritating buzzing noises.\nSo, I decided to return it to [the local sotre], and I exchanged it with a Logitech Z560 where I've topped up some money for it. When I've got it back, I've realise that this Z560 set with only 1 8"" speaker subwoofer on it seemed to give me a better base compared to Altec Lansing 641, but the only thing that I'm not satisfied is, the clearness from the speaker when you're listening to speech. It worked great with Movies as these speaker set is THX certified, but on the music (MP3) and speeches basis, I'd still say that I prefer the Altec Lansing 641 much better for the details of speech and quality. But Z560 has an advantage over 641 on the bass' side.\nI wasn't satisfied with what I've paid for this Z560, so I've decided to return it to [local store] and go for the more expensive version of Klipsch THX 5.1 Promedia, it cost me a lot more than those 2 sets that I've tried out. One thing I've realised, the bass was just satisfying, I'd prefer the Z560's base, but overall, the 5.1 set was awesome when I watched Matrix on DVD, I'm starting to fall in love with this set and that's what I tell everyone about it.\nI'd say, if you can afford it, go for the Klipsch Promedia 5.1 THX system set, or else, I'd say, the Altec Lansing 641 would be a value for money buy, provided it doesn't give you any problems with it.\nThat's all for now. :)";Klipsch5.1THX Promedia vs Altec Lansing 641 vs Logitech Z560
154;138.0;4.0;7.0;5651;I have the 2.1 model. The Speakers are best pointed not at you but about 10 degrees to the left for the left speaker and right for the right speaker. That way the highs won't die off and you still have pretty good center focus. The subwoofer is, in my opinion, too bass heavy. There's a big hill around 70 hertz somewhere, and then it dies out around 30 hertz. The satellites can play very loud with surprisingly low distortion. But that's not the case with the subwoofer. Since the amplifier is inside the subwoofer and that same amplifier powers the satellites, the satellites sorta get killed when the subwoofer plays loud. Oh yeah, don't think this thing is good just because it has THX certification. It's not as strict as the ones on A/V recievers and other stuff like that. You're better off actually listening to the speakers for yourself than take Lucas's advice. But I must say that this system sounds better that most. Good in a large room. So as 3 as the average I would rate it a 3.5. Round it up to a 4. Good luck.;Klipsch Promedia 2.1

I've got everything from the ""19 Triniton Monitor, to the Geforce 3 Ti, 700 MB of RAM...and now, the best sound system you can buy.\nThe Pro-Media 5.1 6 Speaker System is unreal. At first, I was going to go with the 4.1 set. It was on sale on most sites, which [made it cheaper] than the 5.1 system. When I went to look at the two systems, all the retailer had in stock was the 5.1. I figured I would give it a shot. If they say it's the best, I wanted to know why. I was NOT disapointed. This thing is LOUD, CLEAR, and the PERFECT addition to your computer if your into gaming. If you max out the volume control your going to blow your ears out, and the sound is still crystal clear. This is not your average set of computer speakers. I was shocked just at the weight of the speakers themselves. They are built rock solid, and packed with everything you can imagine. The Subwoofer will shake the pictures off the walls. If you wanna impress yourself, and your freinds, this is the one for you.\n...\nOverall, very pleased with the 5.1's. Top notch system from a top notch company. Good luck and enjoy.";The BEST of the BEST...Pro-Media 5.1
156;159.0;5.0;5.0;5688;"...I installed these speakers into my computer to my Audigy Platinum eX and was amazed at the sound quality and clarity. While the speakers are a little costly, the difference in quality over Altec's and Creative's 5.1 systems is impressive. The first thing I noticed was how easy the system was to install into my room. Everything is color coded and the only REAL work was finding a place to put the speakers. The system is made for a stronger low freq performance so audio enthusiasts may be startled by the power of the sub-woofer and amp. One problem I have is turning on the system. When the speakers turn on (irregardless of the volume setting). There is a loud thump as the pre-amp prepares for the audio. Other than that, users will be amazed at how the sub-woofer can rattle your neighbors house at 75% volume. Great speakers for home audio and gaming. Quake 3 enthusiasts and CS fans will be amazed at how much punch a 500 watt system can put out when any form of a shotgun is shot... ;-)";Great Speakers for a Great Price
157;160.0;5.0;5.0;5741;"I've been waiting for Amazon to sell these speakers for a while so I could put in my two cents and tell everyone how great they are, so here goes.\nIn a word, these speakers rock. Quite literally. At 400 watts total, you can expect to fill even a large, family-sized room with sound. The ProMedia are made for your computer, but you can easily hook them up to a receiver or TV, as long as either accepts standard mini-jacks.\nEach satellite has an output of 60 watts, and the sub comes in at 160 watts. I've never had to turn the volume up more than halfway, and the separate knob for subwoofer volume has never gone more than a quarter of the way up (its recommended position), except to impress friends.\nThe speakers come packaged quite ingenuously in a large cardboard box; the four satellites are packed in plastic bags and styrofoam, and underneath them is the woofer. I've kept the box and packaging, since I go to school away from home and need to transport them twice a year. It is very easy to pack and unpack the speakers and cords.\nSetup is relatively simple. The speakers attach to the back of the subwoofer via clamps, and the wires are colored differently so you know which ones to hook up where. One satellite has a ""monitor"" attached to it; this is simply the control panel that has the subwoofer, surround, and master volume knobs on it. The woofer knob is a nice feature, since you can adjust bass easily--the only complaint I have about this system is that the bass can actually be overpowering at times, and it is often necessary to turn it down. The surround knob lets you adjust how much output goes to the rear speakers, making it easy to adjust the ""sweet spot"" for your system. The manual tells you to adjust until you hear equal output from both front and rear speakers, but it depends on your setup.\nAlso included on the monitor are two input jacks for headphones and a portable MP3 or audio device. I've never used the portable MP3 device jack, but the headphone jack comes in handy. The only strange thing is that when you plug your headphones in, the speakers still play sound, but at a lower volume.\nOverall, I got the speakers up and running in about half an hour. They plug into your soundcard with two inputs, one for front and rear. If you're using an SBLive!, make sure you have ""digital sound only"" turned off, or only two of your speakers will output sound. Alas, the 4.1s are not digital speakers, but it hardly makes a difference.\nI've had these speakers for about a year now, and they have been well worth the [money]I spent on them when they first came out. I've tried them with music, games, and movies, and I would have to say that they are best for games and music, in that order. For movies, a center channel really helps with dialogue and other things, but the 4.1s actually do a good job of ""simulating"" a center channel. If you place them just right on either side of your monitor, it seems like sound is coming from the center. For music, I find that the bass really helps make a lot of songs sound better. The satellites have a very rich, full range of sound. The highs aren't tinny at all, but the lows sometimes have too much bass. Again, the amount of bass can be adjusted, but sometimes it is just too much for certain songs. Games absolutely rock on this system. I've tried Counter Strike and Unreal Tournament, among others, and for EAX games, the surround sound is pretty amazing (it isn't too shabby for movies either).\nIn short, if you're looking for a very powerful set of speakers for your computer at an affordable price, there is no better choice than the Klipsch ProMedia 4.1 . I would recommend going with either the 5.1 system or another home theater system if you're interested primarily in watching movies on your computer, but for games and music you're not gonna get much better than this.";These speakers rock
158;58.0;4.0;18.0;5759;It's surprising how many music fans stick with the cheap speakers delivered with their  computers. Considering how much time is spent in front of the computer (rather than  perfectly centered between one's hi-fi system's speakers), this low-to-medium grade audio  has become the primary interpreter of many listener's music experience. And that's a shame, because there are dozens of reasonably priced computer add-on audio systems available whose reproductive abilities far surpass the $19 speakers bundled with most computers.\nKlipsch is a well-known name in home audio, and their products incite both love and hate  among audio enthusiasts.  No doubt their desktop speakers, such as this system, will produce similar (though perhaps less extreme) reactions.  The lesson to be learned is this: auditioning speakers for yourself, in person, is critical.  This can be difficult with  consumer electronics of this price category, as you're unlikely to find them set up in a  quiet room, or available for take-home auditions.  If you plan to audition them in a large (super-)store, arrive at opening to get as quiet an environment as possible.\nThis three-way system (subwoofer and two desktop satellites) compares very favorably to others in its class.  It is a huge improvement over the speakers that ship with most desktop computers, and, depending on taste, a step-up from many of the premium systems one might add to a computer purchase.  The desktop two-way satellites throw an impressive stereo image, and the high- and mid-range have enough sizzle and punch to be present, but not so much as to be fatiguing.  The subwoofer blends well with the midrange.  The desktop speakers are also visually attractive (though not nearly as high-design as some of the competitors), which helps, given that they're within eyesight at all times. One satellite also has a handy auxilliary input jack, perfect for connecting an MP3 player or other temporary input source.\nSet up is simple, though there are a couple of minor issues to be noted. The cabling seems to be a bit more complicated than necessary. A separate speaker wire runs from each satellite to the subwoofer, and then separate cables connect the computer's audio out to the left satellite, and then the left satellite to the subwoofer.  Combining some of these (and perhaps daisy-chaining the satellites) would make for neater setup.\nThe power switch is inconveniently located on the back of the subwoofer. Make sure to pick up a power strip with an on/off switch (or be prepared to climb under your desk).  Also, for cost/price-point reasons, Klipsch failed to add circuitry to mute the audio output when the amplifier switches on. The result is an annoyingly loud pop when the system is powered on. Setting the volume level to zero has no effect.\nFinally, the audio controls are limited to volume and subwoofer, leaving users to adjust balance via the computer's setting (as well as any other equalization one might like to do). Not really much of a problem, but less flexible than some other systems.\nErgonomic nit-picks aside, this is a fine system, with better sound than any of the others in its class. It's well worth the price that Klipsch asks for it (which tends to be a few dollars higher than equivalent models from other manufacturers), and a terrific purchase for anyone whose computer has become a major source of musical sound.\n4-1/2 stars, if Amazon allowed fractional ratings.;Excellent three-piece computer audio system
159;2.0;5.0;763.0;5763;"Sorry to be so Gushy...but I really LOVE these speakers. Having owned high-end speaker systems from Logitech, Labtech & Creative, I have always enjoyed good sound for games and music. As time has worn on, I began to play more music and fewer games on my PC. As a result I began looking for a quality 3-piece system to replace my 5-piece surround system.\nI searched through all the companies I had purchased from before, when I stumbled across the Promedia 2.1's... and let me just say....\nWOW!\n... These speakers are  CLEARLY head and shoulders above all other 3-piece systems - in both power and sound quality.\nYou MUST hear them to appreciate the difference.\n\nPROS:\n- Amazing sound: clear highs, full mid-range and rich tight bass.\n- Power that rivals many home systems (200w-total)- Satellites (35w ea) - Subwoofer (130W)\n- Convenient headphone and auxiliary input jacks.\n- Convenient and separate controls for volume and bass.\n- Very attractive casing.\n- Very easy setup\n- THX certified (which means you will hear things you won't hear on other speakers).\n\nCONS:\n* I cannot think of anything major, but a few drawbacks might be...\n- Speaker system does not have a power switch on the satellite, it is located on the sub-woofer, which is not easy to get to (as it is typically tucked out of sight). However, the problem of shutdown is easily addressed with a power strip.\n- [Costly,] compared to other systems (...though they are WELL worth the difference).\n- Has horn tweeters, which are too ""bright"" for some folks... though I LOVE them.\n\nEverything I play through these speakers sound great (DVD's, MP3's, Digital Camcorder movies, tape player etc.)I do not believe a better 3-piece system exists on the planet.\nIf you are a gamer or home theater enthusiast, I would encourage you to look at this systems ""big brothers"" (the 4.1 & 5.1 Promedia systems) as they are even more amazing (and pricier) for games and movies.\n\nIf you are in the market for a great speaker system I HIGHLY recommend Klipsch to you.\n\n--------Updated 4/21/12------------------\n\nOkay so after 10 years of constant and strenuous use my system gave up the ghost. The other night the sub-woofer blew, in large part because I played back a converted home movie that had high distortion...which of course wrecks speakers.\nMy bad!\n\nNow onto the good news.\nThe next day, I went to Best Buy to buy a replacement system. Much to my delight there was my beloved Promedia 2.1 and the much hyped Logitech Z623 Speaker System side by side. The Best Buy guy was obviously a fan of Logitech, cuz he waxed on how the z623 was an ultra efficient design that had such a clean sound and great power. I thought awesome... perhaps after 11 years someone had overtaken Klipsch for the best 2.1 system under $200. I happen to have my iPhone with me sporting a bevy of play-lists. A little Rock, Country, Jazz, Hip hop and a high energy dance-mix.\n\nSo let the comparison begin.\n\nOn paper both systems spec out a lot alike, in price, configuration and advertised wattage.\n\nThe Logitech z623 is a solid system. It is nice looking has good power, clean sound, nice controls and on/off button. It performed well with jazz and instrumental arrangements like symphony and saxophone. It may have a little better sound image the the Klipsch on those genres of music...however is it better overall system then the Klipsch?\n\nNot in my book!\n\nThe Promedia system is still considerably louder, had stronger punchier bass, cleaner highs and has a way of really filling the room that is more exhilarating and satisfying. If you like Pop, Rock, Hip Hop and Dance music and you like it LOUD, then the Klipsch system is still King of the Hill.\nSo of course I had to go with Klipsch, how could I not after all the good history we've had together? Here's to another 10 years of dependable service and beautiful music together.\n\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it.";Amazing 2.1 system for your PC, MP3 player etc...

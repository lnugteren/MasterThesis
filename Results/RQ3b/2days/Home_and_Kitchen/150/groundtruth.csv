0;1.0;4.0;5.0;0;I am going to be perfectly honest with you guys. I ordered both the 70 inch and the 39 inch mats. When I first got got them, the 70 inch was in a smaller box than the 39 inch mat. So as you can imagine... it was bent when I opened the package, 3 times actually. I was pretty upset because there were creases in it. But I layed it flat over night and in the morning noticed that the creases were MUCH better. (This is the one i took a picture of, sorry you guys don't get to see the mat when I first took it out. I decided that I really liked how it felt and I didn't care too much about the creases. (Its black.. so not too noticable).\nFast forward 2 weeks, the creases are almost non existent. You have to really look for them to find them.\nAll in all I am very happy with these for my kitchen. Super comfy and they have saved my feet from the hard tile!;Creases may disapear
1;20.0;5.0;12.0;85;I have back and nerve pain really bad and my tile floors were not helping. Just got the new mat today but so far its an amazing difference. Super soft and squishy to stand on.  I was able to cook dinner without pain from standing in the kitchen. In my book you can not get better than that. Ill update if anything changes but so far seems strong, flexible, and just perfect for what I needed. Definitely recommend this mat. Plus it looks clean and sleek too.;Soooo comfortable
2;9.0;5.0;19.0;88;I was trying to replace a kitchen comfort mat that was curling around the edges and could cause falls.  I saw the great reviews on the Kangaroo mats and thought the price was very good.  I definitely made the right choice.  It is extremely comfortable and the design on the edges is wonderful and I doubt it will ever curl like the more expensive mat I replaced.  I am very happy!!;LOVE THIS MAT!
3;3.0;5.0;35.0;90;"I got mine for my standup desk at home and it's fantastic. I found myself not wanting to stand very long on my hardwood floors so it was kind of defeating the purpose of having the desk, but now it's much more comfortable to stand for awhile. Since I have hardwoods I can slide the mat under my desk and still sit at my chair, then slide it out when I stand. My feet sink into it maybe a 1/8"" and it's slightly bouncy so I can shift my weight between feet and I can stand for much longer at my desk now. I also don't notice it slipping or anything when I walk away from it and come back to it. Very clean, great design, highly recommend it.";Perfect for standup desks
4;46.0;1.0;6.0;105;This had really good reviews and was expecting more. Ive only had a few months and there are stains that won't come out even though they are supposed to be water resistant. One of them also has the edge coming apart. Disappointed;This had really good reviews and was expecting more
5;2.0;5.0;40.0;108;"As expected high quality anti fatigue runners that help my wife who stands in the kitchen nearly 60 per cent of her waking time.  We are very pleased with the feel. Also we were happy to see the edges were beveled which we could not discern in the photos.\n\n  Our only minor negative would be that it looks ""industrial""  Maybe in the future there could be some pattern or mixed shadings.  We were concerned about ordering the darker shades that might show more dust so we settled on the lighter brown.";Great for areas where working on your feet is required.
6;8.0;5.0;23.0;109;I got this in the mail yesterday, and it's amazing! Very soft, yet firm enough so you don't loose your footing. I keep this in front of the stove and sink area to reduce aches while standing to cook and clean. The mat I had before was half as comfortable, if only I'd known I would have bought this years ago!;and it's amazing! Very soft
7;43.0;1.0;7.0;119;They folded it in half the wrong way and now the product is damaged. Huge seam down the middle of Mat.;They folded it in half the wrong way and now ...
8;64.0;5.0;5.0;120;"I'm so glad I bought this mat.  This is a replacement for another one I had purchased about nine months prior.  I bought a fabric one and realized quite soon after using it that they eventually go flat.  And I mean FLAT (that mat is now in front of the back door - in photo).  I wanted to buy one of these from a local store, but they were really pricey ($60 and up).  I just wasn't ready to spend that much because I was not sure if I would like it.\n\nSo I decided on this mat.  I knew which color I wanted but then could not decide on the length.  I was not sure how a long one would look in my kitchen because of its size.  At this point, I realize I could have used the long one, but this mat is easy enough to move when you need to.  I stand in front of the sink for dishes, and then I cut veggies on the left side of the sink, so I do move it when I do the chopping.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that it does periodically move.  I mean only a fraction of an inch.  But you can look at it in two ways:  It is not completely stuck to the floor, but then again it is not going to mark your floor either.\n\nA couple of criticisms I read in the other reviews was that people trip over it and that they had creases in the mat when delivered.  Let's talk about the creases...NONE.  My mat came completely flat in a large box.  I'm not sure if possibly someone ordered the super long one, but my 20""x32"" came in perfect condition.  (And it was the exact color that was in the picture.)  As far as people tripping over it...they must not be picking up their feet when they walk.  I haven't tripped over it yet.  Even if you have a fabric mat, you would trip over it if you don't pick up your feet.  In fact, with a fabric mat, you run more of a risk of falling because you could catch your foot, flip it up, and then fall.  This mat will not flip up at all - even if you drag your feet.\n\nIt works like a charm, my back and feet feel great when I am standing for a while doing things at the sink and counter, AND the mat is holding up beautifully.  The other nice thing over a fabric mat is that any spills are easily wiped up.  So far, all pros and no cons.";THIS MAT IS FANTASTIC AND BEATS A FABRIC MAT ANYDAY
9;19.0;5.0;17.0;165;Really great mat for the kitchen and elsewhere! Its really comfortable to stand on even in shoes! The beveled edges make it difficult to trip over and the backing makes sure its stays put where you place it. Many people complained of a foul odor coming from the mat but mine has no such odor at all. Its perfect and Im very pleased with this purchase!;Fantastic mat!
10;65.0;3.0;6.0;177;Literally just opened the box and put the mat down. Noticed it has lines down the mat. Don't believe they are supposed to be there. Hoping to hear back from the company.;Comfy but defective.
11;48.0;5.0;8.0;200;I do a lot of canning and the hours standing was beginning to take its toll on my back and legs. I initially bought one of these to see how well it would work but loved it so much I ended up buying three more (I have an extremely large kitchen) for in front of 2 islands and my stove, as well as my sink. They have made a huge difference. They also do a great job protecting my wood floor from spills which is an added bonus. They stay in place but are light weigh enough to be able to just easily move. And easy to clean too. I looked at a number of mats from various manufacturers, including Wellness Mats but ended up choosing Kangaroo due to the lifetime guarantee. Happy I did! I highly recommend them!;Love these Kangaroo anti-fatigue mats
12;72.0;1.0;6.0;211;these travel - you never find them in the same place you put them.  in addition, the edges do not lay flat, so they are easy to trip over.  I have had them a while or I would return them.;so they are easy to trip over
13;18.0;1.0;20.0;214;"We have a lot of traffic in our house with 5 people moving about. I put the pad in front of the sink because I am often standing there for quite some time every day. I wanted a pad that would last, so I paid the extra money for this pad. To my demise, it has lost it's ""padding"" after a few months of use. I am disappointed.";Works at first. Fades with time.
14;13.0;2.0;25.0;276;It came rolled up, and the creases remain.  We decided to keep it because it's feels so amazing to stand on and my GF really wanted it but every day I see the creases and it drives me nuts.  I would love to exchange for one without this issue but I know it won't happen.  2 weeks later they are still there.;Arrived folded, And has creases
15;5.0;2.0;58.0;287;I purchased a 39x20 mat and a 79x24 mat. The smaller one is great and has a very grippy backing. The backing for the larger one feels very different and the mat slides all over the place. You can tell the mats look different so they are probably manufactured by two different companies. The larger one also arrived in a box that was too small so there is a crease in it. Will be returning the larger one.;Tale of two mats
16;14.0;1.0;25.0;289;"We have purchased this on two seperate occasions, we've purchased the 70"" x 24"" both times and both times, and both times they delivered a smaller mat.

17;11.0;3.0;30.0;310;"I just received this in the mail today, and the quality of the material and its functionality in our kitchen are great so far. The thickness and softness of the material feel wonderful under the feet.\n\nI took off two stars, though, because the color ""mocha"" does not look like the ""mocha"" as advertised. The color is a ruddier shade of brown, and I would not have selected this color if I knew this beforehand. These photos are untouched and actually what the mat looks like on our kitchen floor at this moment. I took off a second star because the delivery of the mat was late and did not arrive on the day (Amazon Prime) it was supposed to arrive.";"Functionally? Great. Aesthetically? Whew (at least for the ""mocha"" color)."
18;7.0;3.0;41.0;312;Beware, ordered two gray different size mats to match in our kitchen, but were different colors and had different corners.  Appear to be good solid mats, unfortunately have to return both since I don't know what color mat/edge will come next time...;Different sizes different color
19;28.0;1.0;19.0;330;The chemical smell lasted for DAYS without letting up even the slightest bit -- even though I kept the mat outside to air out. It gave me a massive headache to be around this thing. I didn't want to subject my child or pet to all the nasty chemicals so I returned it. Too bad, because it without the unbearable stench it seemed to be a decent mat to have under your feet.;Chemicals galore
20;113.0;5.0;5.0;334;I, for many, many years, have bought cheap foam mats for in front of my sink.  I do dishes here(have never had a dishwasher)and slide the mat over, when I make big salads. I looked on Amazon,and decided to try this one. I'll never have to buy any other...........Yes, it's an investment. But.....I am 65,and am so worth it!!!!!!!  I got the grey,and am very pleased.;and am very pleased.
21;114.0;2.0;5.0;340;The mat is great for standing on, but it smells horrible, like a old musty basement.  I have left feedback for the seller and the Amazon with no responses from either.  I will be returning this item, unless I hear back today.;The mat smells horrible
22;116.0;5.0;5.0;344;I clearly need to buy like 10 more, because I keep moving it around the house.\n\nIT IS SO LIGHT! I've had mats before, and nothing compares to this - they were so heavy and awkward, it was hard to move them. this is light as a feather, but offers so much support.\n\nPretty sure baby angels made this.;Pretty sure baby angels made this.
23;42.0;3.0;13.0;361;We ordered 3 of these mats and 3 of the Sky Mat.  This mat is fine and the quality seems good.  We wanted to try these because the price is lower. When compared to the Sky Mat we found the Sky Mat to be have more cushion and the employees like the Sky Mat better.;Ok but when compared they fell short
24;131.0;5.0;5.0;423;Very sturdy mat.  Very comfortable to stand on.  Liked it so much I ended up buying two for my family and friends.  This mat will last much longer than any of the other kitchen mats out there currently available.;Very sturdy mat. Very comfortable to stand on
25;86.0;5.0;7.0;423;This mat is so comfortable, I bought it for my wife and she loves it. Both of us noticed right away how it relieves our back ache while bending over the sink doing dishes. I also use it at my work bench. Would strongly recommend. Oh it has nice beveled edges too so no tripping on it and it stays in place.;Relief for sore backs

28;102.0;5.0;6.0;425;I love my new kitchen mat. After being on my feet all day and then having to come home and cook and clean up, I would notice my back and feet hurting. With my new Kangaroo mat I do not notice my back and feet hurting as much after a long day. The mat definitely eases some of the pain while having to stay on my feet for another hour or so in the kitchen. After standing on it for a long period of time it does not even leave an imprint of where I was standing. I have had it for a few weeks now and only have good things to say about it. The red color is exactly as pictured...more of a dark red, not bright red. I only bought one, but I plan to buy another one for the kitchen and one for the laundry room too!;Love Love Love

31;80.0;1.0;8.0;435;"The problem with this mat is that while the top may be ""waterproof"" - and I can't say for sure if that is true - the bottom is like a sponge.  We had this in front of an icemaker  at a home bar and on top of a hardwood floor and when the icemaker shut off during  a power outage, water began to drip out and under the mat and  the mat became soaked and trapped the water in a defined area of the floor.  So, do not buy this product for use in a potentially wet area.  It actually makes matters worse.";Not truly waterproof
32;16.0;5.0;29.0;436;I put this rug in front of my kitchen sink, and it works great. It's a lot easier on the feet than a regular rug, and it easily wipes clean.;Great for in front of the sink!

42;134.0;5.0;5.0;448;Bought two of them and hope Amazon gets the largest size in red, soon.  These are great cushions to work on.  One thing I really like is they are so easy to clean.

They are great anti-fatigue for your legs and feet while you stand preparing meals for your family.

Other than that, it's perfect and I have no back issues after standing for a long period. Made very well, no damage or wear so far.;Great mat to use in the kitchen if you're going ...

92;23.0;3.0;29.0;523;This product is adequate. It provides some cushion and support which has been helpful for having a standing desk. It replaced an anti-fatigue kitchen mat from Costco I had been using for over a year. While I probably would choose the Costco mat next time, the Kangaroo mat is fairly firm and will probably hold up longer. It does slip around the floor a bit, so it's best to use on carpet instead of a hard surface.\nOn the left side of the mat in the picture is a standard yellow highlighter for sizing reference.;it's best to use on carpet instead of a hard surface

100;62.0;5.0;11.0;545;I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He had spinal surgery last year and still suffers from back pain. His kitchen is all tile, and after long enough standing to cook or wash dishes he would have to stretch and was in obvious discomfort. He has been singing my praises since I got him this anti-fatigue mat. He says he wants four more of them to cover the whole kitchen, and I don't doubt that he would do just that. Having worked on it myself, I have to say it is absolutely fantastic and supports your back and hips really well as you're cooking or cleaning. Love it, and will buy again.;Just right for back support
101;68.0;3.0;10.0;549;Although comfortable, I feel that the picture presents a mat that is much thicker than the actual product.  That aside, the color is pretty and vibrant. I was also expecting a larger mat in length.;Although comfortable, I feel that the picture presents a mat ...

111;127.0;5.0;6.0;569;Wonderful mat! It does a great job of reducing fatigue, we've put it in front of our counter where I am usually working in the kitchen. Stains require a bit more than just a quick wipe sometimes to get off, but generally come off very easily. We had another brand before this one, and the material was softer and ended up tearing. This is much sturdier and well made. Highly recommend!;Wonderful mat! It does a great job of reducing ...

But it was no less than a week later that I found a mat at my local wholesale store for less than half the price of this one, it is bigger and it is much more comfortable than this as well. While this mat is still comfortable, it is not comfortable enough for this price.;Better options out there
118;31.0;4.0;22.0;598;The Kangaroo arrived today. It had a slight odor - nothing like the Gorilla I returned because of strong chemical or oil smell.  Both are from same seller. Both made in China. Seller is interested in making you happy with product which I appreciate.\nI like the feel of this one better. Not quite so slick. I like the fact that it's firm yet cushioned but not so squishy  that you feel tipsy or unstable like the Air Mat I returned for that reason.\nThe 4 stars is just a bit taken away for slight odor which I hope goes away. Looking forward to years of use as a survivor of spinal cord surgery & always looking for ways to support my back.\nPS : love the warm brown color;Give the Kangaroo a try

121;93.0;5.0;8.0;618;This mat is incredibly nice to stand on at the end of a long day to do the dishes after supper when my feet and back hurt. Only thing I wish is that it came with fun kitchen designs and pictures on it to hide the water and dirt that inevitably gets on it with my four children around and me and my husband. Brown and black solid colors tend to really show dirt, water, hard water spots, foot prints etc... and that's all the colors these mats come in.;Very comfortable for tired feet, just wish they were patterned or designed to hide dirty spots

I am very please with these mats so far.";NO SLIP, EXTRA CUSHY.

Very impressed with this product. Even placed a stool over it and the pad did not puncture with the pressure of the feet. Highly recommend this product. Ordered the black color, it does have a professional/industrial look to it- like it belongs in a workplace. Would work great under a decorate kitchen rug or something.;Couldn't ask for a better may

This is not the cheapest on the market, but it sure is the best.  Mat will move a little on tile, at least on mind, but that's no big deal.  Try it, you will love it.;Best ever

It also protects the floor from getting wet and slippery from splashing water.\n\nHowever, I do find that mine seems to move- always to the left- and I am not completely sure why.  It doesn't slip while I'm standing on it, I just sometimes find it no longer centered under the sink.;Super comfy, but slides

This mat is far superior to the one I have.  It is so comfortable.  My mother loves it.  At first she was concerned that it might be a tripping hazard but the beveled edges help with that.

148;4.0;5.0;101.0;757;I'm not a chef. I don't work long hours in a restaurant kitchen. What I am is a wife and mother of 2 who likes to make homemade meals for my family about 5-6 nights a week. We have tile floors and I had started to get pains in my feet every night after cooking and cleaning for a few hours. Wearing my Croks wasn't working. I know nothing about anti fatigue mats so I did some online research. Turns out the Kangaroo is the elite name brand of mats. I didn't want to waste my time ordering a less expensive one only to have to return it. This mat is great. I have no pain in my feet, legs or back and I just spent roughly 3 hours cooking dinner then cleaning kitchen... In my socks! I highly recommend this to every person out there who loves to be in their kitchen as much as I do but is in pain. I only wish I could replace the floors in my whole house with this stuff. Oh and it cleans easy with a damp cloth or paper towel and spray cleaner.;Amazing on my feet and back

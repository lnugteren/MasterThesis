0;1.0;5.0;21.0;0;"Have owned this mattress for about a month, and have been extremely happy!  We purchased the LUCID 14 inch Plush twin XL and LUCID 14 Inch twin XL Memory Foam Mattress, so this is a review for both.  The two mattresses fit perfectly in our existing king platform bed frame.  The edges are fairly square, so they fit together nicely.  It did take a full 48 hours for them to fully expand.  Just to note - it was December, and we cracked a window in the bedroom as the instructions mentioned letting them expand in a well ventilated room, so it was a bit chilly.  We did not notice any odor with these mattresses during this time.  Our 14 inch Memory Foam Mattress did not ""grow"" to the same length as the 14"" plush mattress, but not a big deal for us.\nWe made the decision to purchase the two different mattresses because my husband and I are different sleepers - side vs stomach.  We have not had any past experience with memory foam mattresses.  The Plush Memory foam was supposed to be softer, with a deeper sink than all the others.  We really haven't noticed much of a difference between the plush-ness of the two mattresses.  The normal 14"" memory foam seems to respond faster to body weight than the plush memory foam.  We have switched sides, and have had very comfortable sleep on either mattress.\nWe switched from a traditional mattress to these memory foams and really haven't noticed that they have been any warmer to sleep on.  We also haven't really noticed a temperature difference between the two.\nWe did agree that purchasing these mattresses was our best 2017 decision.";and have been extremely happy! We purchased the LUCID 14 inch Plush twin ...
1;5.0;5.0;17.0;32;This mattress is amazing!!  I have no hip or back pain anymore!!! I will be replacing all mattresses in my house with these!!;Best sleep you will ever get!!
2;44.0;3.0;5.0;99;We've had it for 4 years now. We liked it at first quite a bit. 7/10 firmness. However, even though we regularly turn the mattress I can tell there are dips where my husband has slept versus where I have slept. I do not feel like it's holding up compared to our other (3!) Lucid brand mattresses in our homes. I know this is regular wear and tear, we are not heavy people, but not petite either....but it seems to have progressed quicker than expected. I may be looking for a new mattress soon unfortunately, and maybe switching to a different brand.;Like it, but not thrilled with how quickly it's losing it's firmness (4 years)
3;38.0;4.0;6.0;111;"A bit firmer than I expected but it is hard to tell if the mattress will get softer over time (which would be a good thing).  When I ordered the mattress, I was torn between medium firm (this mattress) and plush.\n\nWhen it is time to change out other mattress in the house, I will get the plush version to see if we would like it better.\n\nSome of the reviews indicated the mattress was much thinner than 14 inches but that was not the case for mine.  I got two of them and they both expanded to some where between 13"" - 13.5"" (depending on where the measurement was taken).  I can see the manufacturer claim 14"" since there could be spot where the thickness is 14"".\n\nWe did let the mattress lay in a well ventilated room for almost a week before we lay on it.\n\nExcellent value for what I paid.  The price was/is fluctuate quite a bit depending on when you purchase.";Excellent value for the money

The cover is removable, but zips/unzips under the mattress (which is heavy), and can be washed.  We have found the cover is waterproof!!  A HUGE plus!!  We have the 14"" but honestly could have done fine with a 10"".";We LOVE our bed!!!
5;8.0;5.0;20.0;227;Went from a $4800 queen Tempurpedic HD to the $650 14 inch Lucid in a king and, while I had my doubts, I absolutely love this mattress. It is more comfortable than the Tempurpedic at 1/8 the price. And I swear that no one paid me or gave me a discount or anything else like that to say this. It just really is that good.;Impressed!!!
6;33.0;1.0;12.0;290;If you weigh over 200 pounds this mattress will not hold up for longer then 24 months. Dealing with back issues now due to poor construction. Was great at first, just did not hold up. Hopefully Lucid will do the right thing and refund or replace with a stronger bed. Will update once I hear from them. Again, if your over 200 pounds. Do not buy!;Do Not Buy!
7;59.0;5.0;5.0;295;Finally and real memory foam mattress . We bought a  coil and foam mattress at Costco with great reviews in the industry . After 2 months the mattress lost its memory . Yesterday we received our Lucid , It was the only-one we found with a warranty and now we know why . it is great !! WE did not wait the 48 hours to use and within 6 hours we were in dream land with a firm mattress . Yes thre was a smell when we opened the package but after 4 hours wer did not notice it anymore but even if there was we would accept it as the quality was exactly what we where looking for .\nIf you want a mushy soft , marshmallow mattress. Dont buy this , But if you want a firm mattress that will give you a good night sleep aside from other activities :) I strongly recommend this one;Dont buy this if you want a bad night sleep
8;51.0;4.0;7.0;300;It is excellent mattress, firm mattress with soft touch is great for sleep.  It is just couple of weeks that I bought this.  It says to reverse the mattress every week which is hard to do as it is very heavy and there is no support on side for gripping, so moving is very difficult especially the King size mattress, that is why I am giving 4 starts instead of 5.  Will see how this feels after 6 months or 1 year;It is excellent mattress, firm mattress with soft touch is great ...
9;11.0;5.0;22.0;360;"This is the second mattress by Lucid that we have bought. We have a queen but wanted a bigger mattress so now we bought a king size. The queen we bought about 6 years ago. We did buy a 3"" memory foam topper for our first mattress so we knew when we bought this one that we'd probably do the same. We love the mattress but without the additional topper it's a little too firm for us. I would still recommend this product to anyone. Our queen is still in perfect shape with little sag. We expect the same from this one.";Very pleased!
10;46.0;4.0;9.0;364;its still a little  too firm for us,wish i had ordered plush,these memory foam beds are so much firmer than traditional pillowtop firm matressesses,i normally have  firm posturepedic because of body aches etc so i am use to a firm matress,this is my 2nd gel top memory foam,the 3rd will be plush for sure,and at that it should be equivilant to a firm traditional posturepedic,however if you are larger than 300 lbs a medium firmness should be ok,in this case plush may be too soft for you,i weigh 140 my husband 209,we barely make a lil dent in this matress,so firm memory foams only push in with more weight,the heavier a person the firmer  the memory foam they will need,my suggest is order plush ,it is still firmer than any traditional matress;a firm  bed
11;13.0;5.0;21.0;368;My boyfriend bought this for me when I moved out of a place that had bedbugs. Had to dump my boxspring and mattress and frame....those things are the absolute devil! Bug free when I moved thank goodness and so he treated me to a nice bed since I had been sleeping on the floor for over 4 months (OUCH). This bed is amazing. I have it on a wood slatted bed frame and don't need a boxspring. I've had it for over a year now and it hasn't rolled up like others have said to do (ending up like a taco, sinking to the middle). It has kept it's firmness but you still sink properly like you should in a memory foam. I stay away for work a lot and when I come home I get the BEST sleep ever. Even just sitting on it feels like a cloud. It's the best. Highly recommend it!;Bug free when I moved thank goodness and so he treated me to a nice bed since I had been sleeping on the floor ...
12;27.0;5.0;17.0;418;What a buy! Have been sleeping on it for two weeks. Best sleep in years. The mattress keeps you firmly in same position. It is not too soft and not too hard. Comes in a box shrink wrapped.  Cut the bag and away it goes. Takes about 24 hours for it to be large enough to sleep on. The fumes were strong. We had to leave windows open in room. Then the fumes linger under the covers for a few more nights.\nCompared this to the Sealy TEN INCH we bought for a grand, this is equal in every way.;Great mattress!
13;48.0;3.0;10.0;499;"Does Lucid want to challenge me on this. I don't understand it says 14"" but I have  12 1/2 with proof of picture 5 days after unwrapping.. I did not see where I could contact the Seller directly using Amazon, so I will be forced to contact Amazon directly and dispute this. Box that came to my door look like it had been rolled down a full flight of stairs in the Empire State Building. It was bad, I could look completely in the box by just lifting the left side.\n\nOtherwise I would have given this product a much better review if I got what I paid for. I did not spend over $850 on a mattress only to get 12 1/2 inches. However the bed is comfortable as advertised and I believe meets exactly what it is explained in the product page other than the thickness. Amazon or Lucid, feel free to contact me and make things right, and I will go a head and change my product review. Thank you";Not a 14 inch memory foam mattress
14;35.0;3.0;16.0;518;"So. I got this mattress back on March 2013. It was a great alternative to the much more expensive sleep number bed I used to have. I have Fibromyalgia and sleeping on a regular mattress was so painful, no matter how nice it was. In the beginning it was great.  Firm but forgiving and plush.  After about a year my (now ex) husband's spot was starting to sag i guess you could say.  We would turn it to get on different parts of the mattress. The cashmere cover washed awesome! Stayed soft. But I noticed by about two years my sides were also sagging. In that butt/hip area of your body. I also started getting really bad night sweats and the bed under me would heat up so hot you could feel it with your hand. Never had a mattress do that before. I tried different ""cooling"" mattress covers, toppers and egg crates and nothing helped. I changed to wicking sheets and pillowcases and even the bottom of my pillow would be super hot. I know memory foam can get warm but this was way beyond that. Now I've owned it 3 years and every position it sags so bad. I would even turn it sideways instead of flipping it all the way around, to wear different spots but even my 6 year old felt it. I mean you can't flip it upside down like a regular mattress but you turn the head to the feet, etc. I've gotten over my night sweats but it is still incredibly hot under me, especially if I have been sleeping hard. It causes me pain to lay on it now because of the sags. I got firm Neckar I knew it would soften up some, but this was way more than that. I don't think I would purchase this again because A. It gets so hot. and B. The sagging issues starting at only a year. C. I have attached a picture of what the bottom of the mattress where I slept I guess when I was having night sweats looks like. (It never got wet from anything else)";Good for the First Year, Now 3 years, Not so hot. (actually really hot)
15;17.0;5.0;26.0;658;Three years ago we replaced all our mattresses with these and could not be happier.  We recently went on a trip where we slept on a brand new conventional mattress?  Oh boy did we miss our Lucid King.  We found ourselves rolling towards the middle. We could not wait to get home.  Our home now consists of 3 queen and 1 king Lucid Mattress. We paid $500 for our queens and $700 for the king - well worth it.  They come with a 25 year warranty.  Make sure to buy a protectant cover to prevent voiding your warranty.;Three years and counting
16;25.0;5.0;23.0;689;"I couldn't write a review that would express how much I LOVE this mattress.  It is the best matress ever!  I was super nervous to buy a mattress over the internet but I am glad every single night that I did.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  It was delivered fast, didn't have any ""memory foam"" odor, expanded to full size within a couple  hours, and has been one of the best things I have ever bought.  We have been sleeping on it for about a month and I couldn't be happier.  Neither my spouse or myself suffer from back pain in the mornings anymore!  I have plans to buy ones for each of our kids.  I would definitely buy it again, it's awesome!";The Best Matress EVER!
17;79.0;5.0;5.0;726;"After we got married we bought a split king adjustable bed b/c Im disabled.  At first we got cheap mattresses and those were ok for about 1 yr then, since it was $1500 we upgraded ONE of the matresses in hopes of saving up for another.  6 months later and my husband gave me the better mattress (he is as the cheap ones were killing me although he has two torn shoulders (he is ever the gentleman!)  so for the last 2 months he has not been sleeping very well on the almost 2 yr old cheap mattress SO.....\n\nI SURPRISE him with THIS ONE!!!  We unpacked it, turned the fan on, left for diner/movie and although it says 48 hrs to expand, in ONLY 4 hours it was ""good enough for one night"" he said and no odor at that point!

18;81.0;1.0;5.0;791;We bought this mattress in April of 2013. My husband has chronic back pain and wanted to try a memory foam mattress, since we'd always owned pillow-top spring mattresses. When we received this Lucid mattress, I had no issues with odor, or with the mattress not fully inflating. At first, my husband loved the mattress, due to its hardness. I prefer something softer, but he was convinced it was helping with his back pain so I lived with it. Now, less then 3 years into owning and sleeping on this thing, we are both waking up with terrible back and hip pain. I thought maybe I was just getting old, or was having residual pain from a pregnancy and now regularly lifting a toddler.  It wasn't until we went on a week-long vacation that I realized I was not waking up in pain, and I figured out it was our mattress. Neither my husband or I are particularly heavy people. He's around 180lbs, and at my heaviest (while pregnant) I weighed about 160.  I don't see any obvious indentations on the mattress, but it's clearly the issue. If I sleep on our guest bed I feel young again. If you don't mind spending the money on a mattress that is only good for about 2 years, go for it.;Buy this mattress and wake up with back and hip pain
19;28.0;5.0;22.0;802;"I've had this mattress for just over two years now in the Cali King size. Previously, I've owned quality traditional mattresses, and prefer a firm platform on which to sleep.\nI hadn't seriously considered a foam mattress for myself before purchasing a quality memory foam mattress for my aging Great Dane. She's got hip issues along with the usual older big dog aches and pains. I tried three different expensive memory foam mattresses for her, each lasting only a few months before compressing down to an unusable bowl shape when i found one made from firm, high quality gel foam. (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brentwood-Gel-Memory-Foam-Orthopedic-54-by-35-Inch-Dog-Bed-X-Large-Camouflage/dp/B00BPB3ANW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brentwood Gel Memory Foam Orthopedic 54 by 35-Inch Dog Bed, X-Large, Camouflage</a>&nbsp;). This was obviously a different class of foam. I laid down on her new bed to get an idea of how comfortable it was, and fell asleep. My Dane forced me off of her new bed after her patience expired, but I'd had a nice hour's nap!\nSo I began research, and found out all I could about the different types of foam, density, and construction.\nI settled on this Lucid mattress as the most likely candidate based on price and features, giving density a high weight in my decision since i prefer a moderately firm platform. At 6' 2' and 245 lbs, plush mattresses just don't work for me.\nI'm still very pleased with this mattress two years after purchase. It's slightly softer in the areas that we normally sleep, but no more than beds costing three or four times as much.\nI'm about to order this in a king size for my girlfriend's house, who likes the mattress as much as I do. My Great Dane has a second memory foam bed at the GF's so she's comfortable no matter where we are. It's time I had the same.";Very satisfied after two years
20;72.0;1.0;6.0;868;Bought from Amazon in 11/2012. Was ok for a year and then just got worse and worse. Where you actually sleep will be very soft and gummy and any area you do not sleep on remains rock hard. No way in heck woulf this mattress last 25 years. Feels like fraud to me. Its not like it gets abused either. Very disapointed. Contacting Lucid for refund.;Was ok for a year and then just got worse and worse
21;75.0;1.0;6.0;930;I used to sell matresses.  I can tell you that many a customer who complains suffer from  case of a princess and the pea mentality.  Theyre not happy with anything.  It's been a year since I bought this bed and about 5 months in I started getting back pain.  The matress initially was very firm, and it did soften up, which was nice.  Except it kept softening up.  If I sit where my body has not been its fim, if I sit in the middle where my body is, it sinks a good inch and a half.  As a side sleeper I realize this is bowing my back as the top and bottom have not softened up as such.  The tempurpedic responds to body heat, so he foam contours.  This bed responds differently and seems to respond to body weight.  Since this matress has no warranty and I knew that going in, ive just gone back to sleeping on my foam ikea double.  It doesnt have the bells and whistles this one did, but I never had an issue after 4 years.\n\nYou will want to keep looking for a different manufacturer.  A matress you cant sleep on isn't such a bargain :/;Ive sold matresses. Good for 1 year. You'll want to keep searching

(these were the only complaints I saw about it, both wrong!) I use it on a King size split adjustable bed. It moves fine, its more comfortable than ALL the other beds I tried (ALL were at least 500. and were junk compared to this).If you're thinking about it, BUY THIS BED because at this price (350.) you cannot go wrong. I wrote this review to give honest seller a thumbs up as well as tell people this bed will make a difference! Sure, you can spend more money, but it would be a waste!";LUCID (long twin)14 Inch Memory Foam Mattress - Triple-Layer - 5.3 Pound Density Ventilated Memory Foam 350.
23;9.0;5.0;42.0;1039;This mattress is definitely decent quality for the money. My wife and I are both slightly over 200 lbs, and this mattress has held up well for the two years we have used it. Honestly it feels exactly the same to me today as when we purchased it. The chemical smell others complain about is minimal, and we keep our house pretty closed up. We also keep it pretty cool in our house. We had heard that a memory foam mattress is warmer to sleep on, but we have not noticed a difference. We have the original bamboo cover, and a waterproof terry cloth type cover on it, plus our fitted sheet.\n\nMy wife is 100% in love with this mattress, and would probably sleep on it for another 8 years or so. However, it is a bit too firm for my tastes, so we are about to replace it with another Lucid, this time a bit softer.\n\nUpdate-3 years. We are still very happy with this mattress. It is perhaps a little bit softer then when we originally got it, but it is still very comfortable to sleep on for my wife, and has stayed consistent for me.  I am so impressed with this mattress overall, I will buy Lucid brand mattresses from now on.\n\nUpdate, 4  years later. This mattress still feels it essentially the same as it did when it was new. However, I have noticed something. With time, it seems that I need a softer mattress. I bought a Lucid 10 inch gel mattress  recently that was described as medium firm, and it is much softer than this current mattress. What is strange is that lucid describes this mattress as plush. I would describe this mattress on a scale of 1 to 10 as being eight or nine toward the firm side of  things. I would describe the new 10 inch mattress as a three or four. Either way, I am extremely impressed with how well this mattress says held up, and I will probably only by lucid Brandon mattresses from now on.;Good quality, fair price, overall happy.
24;54.0;1.0;12.0;1057;"Having owned this bed for three years now, I would like to inform you that it was an absolute waste of money and will, very likely, also be a waste of yours, I am sure. Don't get me wrong, it hasn't always been bad. In fact, when we first got this bed, I loved it. I recommended it to all of my friends and family who were looking for a new bed, and even those that weren't. I bragged about it constantly! My husband and I were both military, he was active and I am reserves, and I waited tables, so we both had relatively physically demanding jobs and needed a good night's sleep. This did the trick, and at an affordable price, too... for about a year, MAYBE a year and a half. Maybe. I started waking up achy while I was pregnant but I chalked it up to being pregnant, but my husband started waking up achy, too. Finally, shortly after I gave birth, we realized that our mattress dipped. We have a King sized mattress and we both like our space when we sleep, so we sleep on completely opposite sides of the bed. This bed was NOT holding up! We saw that while the center, where neither of us slept, was still firm, both sides had dips in them, and by dips I mean holes! We sleep in HOLES! Like a shallow grave, and neither of us feel rested any more when we wake up and we are sore all the time. When I contacted LinenSpa about the ""25 year warranty"" they said that as long as the mattress was rotated EVERY WEEK and the divots were MORE THAN THREE INCHES DEEP, we could discuss the warranty. In order to file a claim, we would have to send them our order number and the date of purchase and photographs that proved that the discrepancies were at least 3"". First off, this mattress is more than 100 pounds. It weighs more than 2/3 of my body weight. When we moved houses, it took THREE of us (my husband and teenage step son and myself- and they're not weak men!) to get it up the stairs! To expect someone to rotate any mattress every week is outrageous, let alone one this large and heavy. Second, every reputable mattress company I know of says that there may be up to an inch and a half change over time. Not three inches. Not that that is a big deal, because I assure you these holes are easily more than three inches, but this company says to allow for TWICE what reputable companies do. I honestly wouldn't mind sending them the photos; however, I really have zero interest in owning another one of these mattresses. I'll be much happier calling this a $600 loss than to get another one of these mattresses and be in the same boat a year later. So, we are looking to replace this with a brand new Sealy mattress and it will even come with a  box spring, delivery and set up and removal of this poorly constructed, uncomfortable poor excuse for a mattress for just $300 more than we spent on this. It may seem expensive to buy from a store, but you'll get a company willing to stand behind their product and you'll only have to buy once.";Waste of money- you'll have to buy new mattress within two years.
25;47.0;5.0;15.0;1094;Wow! The best mattress ever!  It was delivered right on time during Christmas break. I helped the UPS lady take it off the truck and get it in my house! I couldn't wait to get it in our bedroom. It is very heavy, but we were able to get this king sized mattress upstairs. My husband and I opened the box and placed the mattress on our existing box spring. We used our hands to tear the plastic off, because we did not want to cut the foam. As soon as the plastic comes off, the mattress will begin to expand. We let it gas off for the 48 hour period. We slept on the old mattress for two nights. Ugg double h!!! But honey, when we went to bed Sunday night, it was an awakening! My husband and I never slept so good. Prior to getting our new memory foam mattress, we tried several mattresses in a store. The only thing that I got was a neck cramp and an ab workout as I tried to hold my head up from the pillows. This mattress was well worth it! This mattress just meets you as you lie down! It contours to your body and you feel yourself sinking slightly.  Because of the price, we were able to order memory foam pillows and 1500 thread count sheets. We use to have to get out bed on Saturday morning, because it was painful to sleep in! Now, neither of us wants to get up!!!!;Awesome Mattress!!!

The mattress sits on wooden slats and has never been exposed to moisture.\n\nWhen I contacted customer service from Lucid (the manufacturer) to get the mattress serviced under the warranty, they told me the warranty didn't cover the mold because it sat on a ""wooden platform."" When I asked for a copy of the warranty, they sent me an information page that said nothing about wooden platforms. When I brought this to customer service's attention, they ignored me and stopped responding to my emails.\n\nDO NOT BUY this mattress. The mattress will grow mold and the customer service is horrible.\n\nUPDATE: 4/13/15\n\nCustomer Service from Linenspa (the retailer) has reached out to me and offered me a partial refund of the cost of the mattress. Although this does not cover the cost of the mattress (or of replacing it), I do appreciate the gesture and the customer service of Linenspa in compensating for the manufacturer's poor quality product. Lucid (the manufacturer) has still not responded to my last warranty inquiries from when I wrote the original review. Thus, I am giving this an extra star for Linenspa's customer service, but it is still a poor quality product that I would not recommend to others. Lucid (the manufacturer) does not honor their warranties and cannot be trusted for something as significant and important as the bed you sleep on every night.";Mold Central
28;32.0;5.0;25.0;1173;We really loved our purchase! We ordered the king size bed, bought it on a Sunday and the item arrived on Tuesday 3 days earlier than what amazon expected delivery! It was huge and heavy, the bed went to life immediately after we pulled off the vacuum plastic wrap, we let it sit the whole day and by the end of the day it has pretty much reached its max expansion, 14 inch is really thick, I'm glad we went for the that size for I wanted a really high bed almost to my hip level.

Yes there's a mild chemical smell when you first open it, that's apparently the deal with every memory foam mattress on the market. The smell went away quickly and hasn't returned at any point. The mattress is a bit heavy for a single person to move around, but not enough to stop a determined individual from laying it on their bed on their own.

40;23.0;5.0;32.0;1297;I have fibro, disc disorder and miafascial pain syndrome.  I needed a good bed.  I have ha this mattress for over a year.  And OMG it is the BEST mattress I have ever had. Bar none.  I recommend this type of mattress for anyone suffering from any form of pain.  Or even for anyone who is healthy.  It's wonderful.  I am 160lbs and I can lay on the same side for over a year and it pops back immediately after I get up.  But if you are over 300lbs.  I have noticed that it can cause it to not spring back after some time.  I have a family member who is very large and has that issue.  But they just turned it around after every year or two.  I recommend this product to everyone.  Period.  And get you some 1500 count sheets to go with it. Happy sleeping. :);A year after

43;6.0;5.0;65.0;1319;oh boy oh boy I'm over the moon in happiness. I have been sleeping on a Stearns and fosters for the past 13-14 years and my body has been beat up. These past few years I have not had good nights sleep wanted the tempudric mattress with massage stuff, could not afford it. Researched on Amazon and found this Wonderful Wonderful mattress. Its only been theee days since I slept on it. Well let me tell you I didn't wait the whole 48hrs I did close to it at 40. the first night I don't know what hit me but when I woke up the next day it was like I woke up from the best rest coma ever! I'm telling you I'm a totally different No more backaches, no numbness I'm hands from the pressure. I have a lot of disabilities from work. Wow is all I can. say Thank You Lucid ;Thank You Lucid
44;100.0;5.0;5.0;1329;"I LOVE this ""mattress"".  Just as comfy as Tempurpedic without the price. I HIGHLY recommend it!!  I am a Massage Therapist and it is the best thing I have ever slept on.  Ahhhh .. . .";LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!
45;101.0;4.0;5.0;1447;I've had this bed for about 3 months now and I must say that I think it's comparable to many high end memory foam mattresses at a fraction of the cost. When I bought this mattress I paid $399 which I consider to be well worth the cost.\n\nWhen I first bought the mattress It was heavy, weighing in at about 85lbs. The outer packaging was a little damaged and shredded upon arrival but the mattress and inner packaging was intact. I open the mattress and gave the recommended 48 hours to let it expand there is a chemical smell upon the unboxing of the mattress but it will subside withing those 48 hours of expansion and it should disappear within 1 to 2 weeks completely.\n\nThe bed itself is very comfortable and I would consider it firm yet supportive which is exactly how it should feel. I don't understand how some people would consider this akin to sleeping on a stone slab. This isn't a super soft bed that you'll sink into but it's by far more comfortable.;Great Bang for your buck
46;69.0;1.0;9.0;1458;The shipping was quick and the box arrived in great condition. I opened it (a big mistake) and let the mattress expand. I say it's a big mistake because by opening it I voided the 30 day satisfaction guarantee from LinenSpa. That's right, for 30 days you can get your money back if you're not satisfied with this mattress... but only if you didn't open the package. So if you're the type of person who can gain satisfaction from staring at a box, this is a guarantee you can really hang your hat on.\n\nSo the mattress expanded to full height and there was no smell. We've been using it directly on the floor until the platform arrived for it. In the interest of disclosure I'm a big guy. When I lay on this mattress my back sinks in about four or five inches, my head and feet sink in about one inch. So all night my neck is cranked forward and my feet are resting at a higher level than my head.\n\nSleeping on my side, my neck cranks to the side and my legs are angled so there is more pressure on my hip. Sleeping on my stomach feels like I'm doing a gracefully arched swan dive into back pain. Any sleeping position on this mattress makes my back pain worse. It has also made my snoring worse because my head is cranked forward.\n\nBefore this my wife and I were sleeping on an old hand-me-down inner spring queen mattress. Luckily we didn't get rid of it. She's much lighter than me and woke up on the LinenSpa with back and neck pain every morning. She won't sleep on it anymore and has gone back to the queen.\n\nI saw a lot of reviews where people said they returned the mattress. I tried to return it through Amazon and they directed me to LinenSpa who let me know that there was no returning it. Don't be fooled by their 30 day satisfaction guarantee, it's a scam. If you want to buy this see if you can somehow try it out. Otherwise you're rolling a set of $650 dice.;You cannot return this mattress
47;80.0;1.0;7.0;1483;"I bought two of these mattresses a week apart from Amazon.  The first one was awesome.  It arrived in time, well packaged, and inflates to its proper size, well, 13"" instead of 14"", within a few days.  But that is enough to stretch the mattress cover tight.  It looks good and feels good.  It is meant for my daughter and I think she will love it.  Yes, we have had it for over a month, but still have not slept on it.  Just make sure your bed is low, as this mattress is very thick once inflated.\n\nThe 2nd mattress arrived in the same condition and appears to be normal.  However, after leaving it on the floor to inflate and air it out, it never inflates to the proper thickness.  In fact, the inflation is so uneven that the ends of the mattress only measures 10"" and the middle close to 12"".  A stark contrast to the ones I got just week ago.  Keep in mind this mattress was also aired out and lay out on the floor for over a month as well.  Thank goodness for Amazon no hassle return, UPS came and picked it up today.  But not before it took my wife and I over an hour to wrap it up in plastic and make-shift cardboard box.  No easy task, I tell you.  Once it is inflated, there is no way to revert back to its vacuum packed state.  What a pain.\n\nSo to summarize:  great item...so far.  But possible quality control issue.  I will update once the mattress has been slept on for 6 months or so.\n\n1st Update:\nIt has been used closed to 5 month now by my daughter.  Here are the pro's and con's:\nPro:  It still retained its shape, firmness, and we can still sleep on its edge without it collapsing.  That is good.\nPossible con:  since it is for our young daughter, we have a waterproof mattress cover installed just in case she has an accident.  And she did once and it did help preventing the mattress getting soiled.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hypoallergenic-Waterproof-Mattress-Protector--Warranty/dp/B0035E63WM/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1401075448&sr=8-9&keywords=waterproof+mattress+cover\nTo this date, we can still smell odor emanating from mattress.  Not strong, but still noticeable.  Not sure if it is because it was covered by this water proof mattress cover or not.  My kid will be away for about two month.  I will remove the cover and let the mattress air out for 2 more month to see if the odor still remain.  Stay tuned.\n\n2nd UPDATE:\nIt has been a month since I took the mattress cover off and let it air (door/window open).  I can still smell the odd order from the mattress after this much time have passed.  As a reference, the Lucid 12"" 4lb memory foam mattress I ordered a few months later does not have the smell and it is always covered by mattress cover.  My other memory foam mattress from a different brand purchased at a local store also do not emit any odd odors.  So there is definitely something wrong with this line of mattress.  I have since amended my rating accordingly.\n\nI have since contacted the manufacture to see what they will do about it.  Stay tuned.\n\n3rd Update:\nLucid told me to air it outside and wash the cover.  I did for the past 3 days, smell still remain.  Mind you, this close to 9 month post purchase/use.  It is not the cover at all.  The odor is from the mattress itself.  Once my wife and I move it out to the backyard to air it out, the bedroom does not have that distinctive odor anymore.  so it is definitely the mattress that is emitting it.  So far, it has been in the yard for 3 days, I can still smell it.  I will give it 4 more days before I continue with my warranty claim with Lucid.  Stay tuned.";Avoid this mattress at all cost.

48;52.0;2.0;15.0;1516;I really like the mattress but it got somewhat hot during the summer. However, it is comfortable and is pretty thick. (Original review)\nAfter couple years of purchase... the mattress began to bend on the sides and become loose where you rest the body..\nrecently I contacted the mattress company about the 25 year warranty and I was told that it does not qualify... the damage is obvious yet it doesn't qualify.. now I have back pain due to the sinking issues since is not an even sinking section.. bad experience with this mattress :(;Update on mattress.. after few years
49;102.0;5.0;5.0;1549;"It's that good. We did what most people who are scared of buying a bed of Amazon do: read waaaay too many reviews and go test out some similar height beds at our local stores. We realized in our shopping around that height = comfort/quality for the most part when shopping for a memory foam mattress.\n\nIn all the stores we went to, we never actually found a mattress that was thicker than 12 inches and those beds were $1,700-$2,000. That pretty much sealed the deal for us.\n\nShipping: I will say that shipping this 100lb beast must have been a nightmare. The box was shredded, retaped, then shredded again. Lucid did a really good job of wrapping the mattress in a couple layers of thick plastic sheeting and the mattress itself didn't have a scratch on it.\n\n----------------\n\nLong Term Review: It's now been over 6 months of sleeping on our 14 inch Lucid and we couldn't be more happy with that bed. It's soft, it's firm, all at the same time. Best $500 we've ever spent. Pull the trigger. When we need another bed, we'll be buying more 14"" or 12"" beds from Lucid on Amazon.";Sometimes my wife and I just make love to this bed instead of each other...
50;29.0;5.0;30.0;1569;"I have been researching and looking for a memory foam mattress for many years. However, I tend to be somewhat of a ""label"" junkie, so I thought a Temperpedic was the only way to go. Unfortunately, I just couldn't justify paying over $3000.00 for one so I have stalled and stalled and finally I saw these mattresses on Amazon. I love the savings that Amazon will offer and after reading EVERY review about this mattress I decided I would give it a try. For the price, I decided that really, I couldn't lose. If it didn't work for me, I would not be out an extreme amount of money and could possibly resell for almost or equal to what I paid for it.\nFirst of all to all of you reviewers - my deepest thanks! You all were pretty much right on in your evaluation of this mattress. Secondly, I don't think I have been this happy with a purchase in a long time. When I wake up in the morning my back is really stiff and many days when I roll out of bed, I feel like I have been hit by a Mac truck! I have to be careful how I walk until I ""limber"" up and then I can resume my normal range of motion. NOW I can get out of bed and walk normally and feel like I have already gone through the warm up process of my morning. I have no pressure points at night. I am not lifted off the bed when my husband rolls over and when my 75 lb dog jumps on the bed, I don't even feel it.\nI love this mattress! I couldn't be happier with it and I couldn't be happier with the price. I do have the same issues with the oder of the mattress but as time goes on that has lessened and I have put dryer sheets between the bed pad and sheets to freshen the smell of the mattress and that has helped tremendously.\nI don't find the mattress to be to warm. That could be because I prefer to sleep in a cool bedroom and sleep with the windows open but I still feel the mattress breathes. When the mattress arrived, the trucking person helped me bring it into the house but I unpacked it by myself and let it de-compress for the amount of time recommended and it expanded to the full 14 inches.\nFor once - with the help of other reviews not being a label junkie has paid off!";Happy sleeper!
51;34.0;5.0;28.0;1583;"We got this mattress in February, 2013.  Nearly every night that either of us lays down one of us is usually saying ""I love this mattress!""  It is hard when we lay down and then we just 'sink' in and go to sleep.  The mattress is just plain GREAT!!!  We were concerned about our being too heavy for the mattress or 'sinking' in like a quick sand type of experience but it just has never happened.  It does retain heat - and in the desert southwest - we were worried.  However, it is not 'hot' but you do notice the heat in the mattress.  I personally like the recovery of the foam - that is to say, if I get up in the middle of the night for a quick trip to the loo when I get back to the bed the mattress has recovered from where I was sleeping and I get to experience the 'sinking' back to sleep all over again.  I LOVE it!!!  I am getting up in my years and I have slept on a lot of mattresses over my lifetime - by far - this one is ranking in as the best I have ever slept on night after night and now from mid-winter through summer and now in to fall I can only say it has passed the test.  Plain and simple, I love this mattress.";GREAT MATTRESS
52;103.0;1.0;5.0;1593;Updated review:\n\nI've had this mattress since 2012 and I can say with certainty that you should avoid it.  Like other reviewers, I have also experienced the valleys that are created upon sleeping on the mattress.

53;82.0;1.0;7.0;1596;Do not buy this bed if you like a soft comfy mattress, it's as hard as a rock or more realistically like laying on on an area rug on the floor.

54;41.0;5.0;22.0;1608;"My wife and I purchased this in the king size to replace our old queen size bed. We chose this mattress because of the depth of the comfort layer, but be prepared for the firmness. In fact our intention is to also supplement this with the Lucid brand 2.5 inch gel mattress topper for some additional cushiness, and also some protection for the matress as this mattress cannot be flipped without sacrificing the whole point of multiple types of foam layering. If you're looking for the sleeping on a cloud feeling right out of the box, then I'd suggest taking a look at the 14"" plush Lucid matress. As a note to the smell, all foam type mattresses and matress toppers have the chemical smell when brand new. Just follow the directions regarding letting the mattress air out for a couple/few days before putting sheets on and sleeping on it. Overall we're very happy with getting exactly what we expected without having to spend close to two thousand dollars. Another quick note would be the condition of the packaging. The box arrived incredibly beat up, but as others have mentioned the mattress was in no way damaged. So if you don't plan on keeping the box for sentimental purposes, I'd say expect your box to be damaged but not the mattress. I would highly recommend the Lucid brand to anyone shopping for a new mattress.";Wonderful mattress, and firm just like the title says.
55;104.0;5.0;5.0;1628;"***UPDATE*** I ordered all of the items listed below a little over 2YRS. ago and I'm still very pleased and happy with everything I bought! All totaled, if memory serves, I paid $750/total for everything! The bed, overall, is what I'd term ""medium firm"" and can have, at times, a Cooling effect and other times can get a little Warm (I think I've narrowed it down to how humid it is weather-wise -- and I have a bedroom in an air conditioned house in the basement, just so you have some context!). I will say, as a word of caution/awareness, that the bed gets delivered ROLLED UP like a Swiss Cake Roll and it was very taxing and hard to manueur by myself -- (I go to gym x4/week and lift heavy. Guesstimating bed weighs an easy 75# and seems WAY more than that when ""unrolled""! Just a word to the wise to have some help if you cannot handle something like this... ALSO, regarding people and their issues with SMELL: after the first week I've never noticed any smell. I bought 14"" LUCID memory foam bed, SLEEP MASTER metal bed frame, and SLEEP TITE mattress protector all bundled together for less than $700/total. The bed has given me restful nights sleep and I see how shades of all reviews that I read prior to buying bed would be true: there is a slight smell associated with bed that was not bad at all to begin with and has subsided yet I did still ""get a whiff of"" one day this past week; the bed is a little firm but isn't by any means uncomfortable; if anyone has specific questions ask here on Amazon and I'll be glad to give you my opinion.";Great Value

Decided to go rogue and buy a King sized memory foam mattress.  After lots of research decided on this 14"" LUCID.  It matched up to the best specs that top of the line MF mattresses had.  I also read many reviews like this to get a sense of how satisfied people were with it.  Arrived the next week in a big, heavy cubical box.  Setup was a task because of its size and weight.  Let it air out for 48 hours before sleeping on it.  It's been a month of sleeping on it and we are both totally satisfied with this choice.  It didn't take much getting used to it.  Sleeping on it is very restful.  The mattress smelled a little at first but nothing now.  The bed is very firm so we put a pillow top cover on it.  You don't really sink into it that much so turning or getting out of bed is no problem.  We both don't weigh that much.\nOverall, we like our new MF mattress very much and recommend it to anyone wanting to try a new experience from spring mattresses.";Peace in the Valley

After a few months, we noticed a ""crack"" had formed in the top layer of the foam.  It eventually now has wrapped all around into a huge circle on the side of the mattress, where she would sit on the side of the bed, basically making it very uncomfortable to lay on.  Since she lays on one side we swapped top to bottom so the crack/circle was on other side, but it seems its starting again.  It may be only because she sits on the bed for some meals and TV watching, but still, very poor to have it do that.\n\nI tried to contact someone about the warranty, exchange, or someway to try a new one since I was hoping this wasn't normal.

62;76.0;4.0;8.0;1757;"When you're looking for a ""memory foam mattress to sleep like the dead"" (useful search phrase, btw, try it!), you'll find the weight of the memory foam matters.  Weights tend to run from 3 lbs to 6 lbs.  You can think of this as how much weight is needed to compress the mattress (though its really how much a 1 ft cube of the foam would weigh).  Less weight means more bubbles and less foam, and so compresses easier and is usually also cheaper.\n\nSince the weight isn't specified on the more expensive Lucid By LinenSpa bamboo/charcoal mattresses, how do I know what they are?  I asked LinenSpa which is the firmest!\n\nHere's the official LinenSpa answer:\n\nThe firmest of these mattresses would be the 14 firm with the 5.3 lb. memory foam. The other two are manufactured with plush memory foam and will feel much softer. In the mattresses with bamboo charcoal all of the memory foam layers are made with 3 lb. dense memory foam. The top bamboo charcoal layer on the first two mattress does not have gel infused into it. Bamboo is a naturally breathable fabric, however so many do find that it does sleep cool regardless.\n\nThis Lucid by LinenSpa 5.3lb firm is what it says on the tin.  The 16"" and 14"" with the bamboo charcoal layer are 3 lb soft foam.\n\nHope this helps other buyers out there trying to compare these products!";Firmer than the more expensive two
63;94.0;4.0;6.0;1761;"I think all of us online shoppers can rule out going to the local bed shop and dropping $1500-3000 on a memory foam mattress. We're all here because we're savvy and have a little risk taker inside ourselves telling us that 50%+ savings is worth taking that leap of faith. That said, we all look to the product review section for advice and so I decided to do my part and give back to those who helped me make this purchase.\n\nThis bed is $500 and feels like a $1800 mattress, I'm completely satisfied. If you're wondering if you should spend another $250 and get the next model up, it may have an extra $250 in value in it but I wouldn't know. After sleeping on this mattress, I can tell you that if I could wave a magic wand and have that model above this one instantly and my wallet would also feel $250 lighter, I wouldn't do it.\n\nI did see some reviews that said the mattress was ""firm"" and its sounded like they meant it with a negative connotation. This mattress is memory foam... If you've every slept on one, like me, I can assure you this one feels no different. I'm a light sleeping and have occasional shoulder pain ad last night I slept like a baby.\n\nBottom line - The quality per dollar spent is very, very high.

66;77.0;5.0;8.0;1801;"I purchased this mattress with some trepidation.  Was not sure about buying a mattress without trying it first. As many have said the box showed up and looked like it had been handled roughly. The product within was prefect without even a mark on the plastic it was wrapped in. Once opened it took less than a day to fully expand.  The smell is strong but not as overpowering as some have said, although having worked around chemicals I maybe more tolerant of the smell.  I have three different lower back issues (multiple ruptured disks, stenosis, degenerative arthritis) and have not been able to sleep for more than an hour or two at a time for several years now.  The first night we slept on the mattress it was a little different and i was not perfectly comfortable, however I slept better than I had in years. The second night i awoke only once during the night.  The more I get used to the mattress the better I am sleeping.  I am not going to say that it ""cured my back pain"" but I will say that I am able to sleep through the night without having to wake and change position every hour or so because I hurt so much.  To me that is a miracle.  I am very happy and would recommend this without any hesitation.  Conventional wisdom is that it takes about 60 days to become accustomed to sleeping on memory foam and for the mattress to break in correctly, I don't know about that, it is working very well for me after only a week, so I guess it only get better from here.  I am only sorry that i waited so long to get a memory foam mattress.  Hope this helps someone else.\n\nUpdate: After a month I cannot say how happy we are with the mattress. I can say we are sorry we waited so long to get one.";I'm sold
67;106.0;5.0;5.0;1802;"I needed a new mattress, I had a traditional coil spring and it had developed the compression body curve and I had very bad back pain. It was less than 6 years old and lasted well. I have health problems and spend a large amount of time in bed. I am a big guy so I was concerned that a memory foam mattress might not be the best idea.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the negatives which are minor; 1. You will sink in and it is difficult to turn, I am a big guy but this would be less of a problem for a lighter person but it will still happen. Now from my research this is true for the vast majority of memory foam mattress so be prepared for this. Unless you have serious physical limitations you can and will adjust. The nice thing is that you find that you do not toss and turn as much. 2. When you get out of bed you sink a little, again this is a characteristic  of memory foam mattress, but not a real problem. 3. This mattress is so comfortable that you can actually end up sleeping in a position that will cause you to be sore or stiff in the morning, Again, you will eventually adjust. These are all minor and while they say you need to give these mattress 30 days so you adjust to them, I think it depends on the individual.\n\nNow for the positives which out weigh the negatives; 1. Comfort, if you are coming from an innerspring mattress you will notice that these mattresses support you all around and yes you are literally cradled in comfort. 2. As I mentioned above, tossing and turning are greatly reduced. It was not uncommon for me to wake up 6-7 times a night to turn or adjust on my old mattress even when it was new. I have broad shoulders and I use a Cpap so I wake up to turn. Now it is maybe 3-4 times a night on a bad night, usually just 1-2 times and sometimes none. 3. I sleep deeper and wake more rested, with significantly less pain and stiffness.\n\nIn closing I would highly recommend this mattress, especially if you are a larger person or couple.";As described, nice and firm
68;53.0;5.0;16.0;1808;"This bed is firm. I read some reviews saying it was as hard as a rock and I'm confused to what rocks they are holding but it is firm. It is not hard by any means. I've slept on some hard spring beds and this is nothing like that what so ever. I've slept on pillow tops harder. It's a great supportive soft bed. It reminds me of a marshmallow. Firm yet squishy. I slept on my mattress last night and I didn't wake up once to roll over and the noise is gone from the old spring mattress.\n\nThe bed is thick. I wish the the cashmere cover on it wasn't as loose but oh well. It doesn't slide but it isn't as tight as I wish it was but it's not been the complete 48 hours either since. It has been 24 and I really don't think it will be expanding anymore but if it does I'll add to this review. I am doubting it will.\n\nThe smell it has airs out quickly. It's winter here and 24 hours later there is only a hint of a memory foam smell. It's the same smell my pillow had when I bought it. Nothing to crazy but if you're not expecting it it could worry you. It's fine though. It is no worse than craft glue or paint. Only these fumes can't hurt you.\n\nThe only reason I don't 5 star this bed is because it's not quite as high as I thought it would be. I measured my bed frame and how high my mattress needed to be and it isn't quite as high as expected but it is foam and that happens. nothing a topper or a bigger pillow can't fix. The smell was a bit to be desired for and the fact that you smell like it if you sleep on it. If you plan to buy this mattress don't plan to sleep on it the first night. One, it might not be done expanding. Mine took several hours it says in the book it may take 48 hours. Two, the odor coming from the bed it very over whelming at first and you will smell like it if you lay all over it. It isn't fumes it's just the smell of the foam. It can't hurt you but no one likes a bad smell at their house.\n\nOther than that the bed is well worth the 400.00 + they ask for it. I would have paid more. I am actually shocked at the price for the quality and now I'm interested in how long it will last. I plan to add to my post when it needs to be replaced or if it begins to wear down.\n\nThe bed is amazing though, not hard. Not too soft but as I said a firm soft mattress. It's not like sleeping on feathers. Like I said it's like sleeping on a jumbo marshmallow. That's the only description I can give. Unless you want to call it baby bears bed, not to hard not to soft.\n\nI did read some reviews about the top not being 100% cashmere and I have to say ""duh"" cashmere is expensive and you shouldn't expect a entire mattress to be wrapped in it for 400.00. You can't get a scarf that is made of 100% cashmere for less than 150.00 unless its on sale. This is a HUGE mattress. It is soft. It probably has cotton in it I'm not sure but it is soft. I do think they expect you to put sheets on the bed though. So why the mattress cover matters is beyond me. I also read a review about the bed not being made of 100% memory foam. If you look at the picture and read the arrows it clearly tells you how much memory foam to expect and how much support foam ect. I am not sure I could sleep on a bed that is 100% memory foam. I think it would be hard to get out of seeing how you melt into it.\n\nThe packaging was beat up a bit. But my package only had a few holes from being thrown around in the truck. The mattress is wrapped very tightly with 2 players of tape and plastic so it doesn't really matter but don't expect this to be perfect boxing. It is a bit heavy to lift. My eleven year old daughter and I together brought it in off my deck porch. My husband got it up the stairs him self. I would suggest you unroll the bed on your box spring or plat form bed. Between the weight and the smell unrolling it and them moving it is a bit much. That's just my suggestion to others though.\n\nAll in all great product! I'm very pleased! I can't wait to sleep in it again tonight! Thanks LUCID for the deal and a great bed!\n\nUPDATES-\n\nIt's been a little over 2 years or so and I just recommended this bed to a friend. I've had no issues with this bed. This bed was moved and got smashed down our tight stair well. It has been jumped on by kids, smashed, moved, flipped and still the same as when we bought it.\n\nThe only issue is the memory foam on top ripped. I expected that with the price and plan to add just another piece over top of it. It's not really noticeable while sleeping but it's a crack.\n\nStill a great bed & I would buy another!\n\nIt is now 2017. I bought this bed in 2013 I believe. It's still working great and I get compliments on how soft and comfortable it is. Still not sinking or losing height.";Nice bed for a great price!!
69;89.0;2.0;7.0;1813;"I agonized over buying a mattress.  I read every review for every memory foam, latex, and some crazy combo of those on this site and I swear I felt I was absolutely certain this one would be the perfect one for me.  Unfortunately I am returning it.\n\nI'm not a hugely picky sleeper, but it seems almost impossible for me to believe that these reviews are real.  I will say my last mattress was a Tempur-Pedic that was given to me by someone who had used it for a couple years.  It was wonderful.  Inside it had 4"" of memory foam that really felt like how you imagine memory foam should.  It compressed under your body and conformed to you.  It was a dream to sleep on.\n\nThis bed is NOT ANYTHING like that.  Please if you are reading all the 5 star reviews and expecting a ""firm but comfortable"" bed you are being misled.  I have a really hard time believing this is a 4 1/2 star item.  I've never slept on a bed this hard.  Not firm, hard.  There is almost no give whatsoever and I weigh 160lb.\n\nI sleep on my side and stomach.  When I was on my side on my old bed my knee's and hips would sink in a little which would make it very comfortable.  On this one my knees are totally unable to make any dent in it, which leaves my feet actually feeling like they are FLOATING above the mattress!  On my old one my entire body would sink in just enough to be fully supported, but on this I feel like only a few points of my body are taking all the pressure.\n\nI'm giving this 2 stars as they do at least warn you it is firm, and really if you want something with almost no give, this is it.  Let me be one of the few voices of reason before you buy this mattress.  I press my hand into this bed and it decompresses instantly, no ""hand print"" at all.  Thats just not good memory foam!  I am not giving hope on buying a mattress online for cheaper, but this was a disappointment.  As someone whose spent over 10k on Amazon, this will be my first return.";"Do yourself the favor and read through the reviews that mention ""FIRM"""
70;97.0;5.0;6.0;1819;It takes a while for the mattress to become firm then soft. When you receive the package BE WARNED! Looks can be deceiving. The box is very large a rectangular shape and you will think that one person can carry it. It takes two people to get this bad buy in the room. When you open it, all you get is a mattress foam pad with plastic covering on it and all the air sucked out. When you first slice into it you can tell that the air has been sucked out because the mattress is literally bursting out trying to get some air! When you open it, make sure to open it in your room and the place you would like your bed. My dumb self opened it in the living room. When you take the plastic covering out the mattress will let air in the foam and will expand to its proper height in like a day or two. Though other reviews are right, it does have an odd scent to it as if it had some kind of weird clean chemical to it. It does not last long, I've had my mattress for over a year and I love the feel, and my friends are always comfortably laying on it and always giving compliments. Would recommend especially for the price.;Sitting on this bed while typing this.
71;107.0;1.0;5.0;1826;I brought this after seeing reviews where people said hard/firm mattress but I'm sinking in when ever I go to bed and I don't feel the support which was promised for this mattress. its been only 4 months since I got this. This definitely not the one I wanted. I hope/wish if the manufacturer exchanges this with some good quality one.;I feel I got a defective piece
72;78.0;1.0;8.0;1830;"I wanted to like this mattress but was very disappointed. We were sleeping on a broken spring mattress and my husband wanted it back! We waited the 48 hours and it never expanded evenly and never to the fit height. The outside was 13"" and portions of the inside were 10-11"". We hoped it would continue expanding past the 48 hours but definitely didn't. Also was sooo hot, kept waking up covered in sweat, and I have never been a hot sleeper and am not overweight. I had to return and amazon was extremely helpful. We did take a chance on the other 14"" plush lucid cashmere bamboo mattress and it is fantastic. Expanded to the right height , extremely comfortable, and the husband is happy !";Really wanted to like
73;98.0;1.0;6.0;1833;I decided to order this bed for my husband.  My husband has been in active duty for the past 15 years and after 2 surgeries on both his shoulder, elbow, hip,  plus several other aliments he isn't old enough for surgery yet, he doesnt get a comfortable nights rest. We slurged and even with the simplest pleasures like sleeping, I hope he gets back to a good nights rest, and soon.\n\nI ordered this product after reading all reviews(even the bad), I have to say the bed was delivered extremely fast(2 days).  But with a manufactor in Charlotte, NC, which isn't far from me (1-2 hrs) I wasn't surprised.  The box was extremely damaged but with a 150lbs box and one person probably loading, that is the least of my worries.  I am not sleeping on the box.  Right? After opening  there is a laminated card with instructions on top that says.... In my own words...\n\nYour bed will stink, put in a well ventilated room on a flat surface so your bed can fully extend which takes 48 hours. Lenghts per mattress will vary. Then gives you warranty info on the back and the website to follow for full warranty Lucidmattress.com.\n\nToday is almost 24 hours and the bed is almost fully extended.  I have problems with smells, which usually give me headaches, and I was surprised that after the bed being in a room with windows open and a oscillating fan the smell isn't as noticeable.  By tomorrow night my husband and I will be sleeping on this bed. I am excited! For him! Be back in a week to update..\n\n*1/30/2013 Less than a week after purchase*\n\nI hate to say it but I literly hate this mattress.  I wanted so bad to love this thing and hoping that is would help my husband.  # 1 this mattress is labeled as FIRM.  I have laid on FIRM memory mattresses and this isn't firm.  To be honest it feels like we are sleeping on playdough with no support. memory foam should have support and contour to your body. this mattress doesnt do this. #2 The bed sleeps different with only one person in it. Very odd. and it always seems my feet are angled up and is very uncomforatble on my knees(runners knee) when trying to sleep on my sides.  If I even come close to my hsband to cuddle to his back it causes a huge sink hole. you sink in, once sucked in its very hard to move.  I range with sleeping patterns during the night. I find in this past 4 days I wake with a kink in my neck and maybe only being able to sleep for aprox 2-4 hours(going to bed at 10 and waking at 6:45). As far as my husband he does say that he wakes with less aches but the softness of this mattress keeps him up as well.  serves me right for buying something without laying on it first.  Needless to say we will be contacting Customer Servies for a return.  Will update in a week..\n\n1/31/2013 Return process Hope this helps people when ordering\n\nI contacted Amazon through their live chat after putting in a request to return mattress.  Going through process on comp there is only option to return through fedex and since I read all reviews and learning about returns on this item I was confused that amazon wouldnt have a different option on large parcel items when trying to return.  During live chat the person that is chatting can only answer basic questions. The person I spoke with gave me the number to Customer Service which is open M-F 6am-5pm 1-866-216-1072.  After calling I was informed they would put in a request with a large parcel company in the area and I would be contacted within 24 hours.  I asked if I wasn't contacted in 24 hours do I need to call customer service back. They then sent me an email with info of the company they were putting the request in for.  So I wait, bunking at night with my daughter.;Helping my husband
74;70.0;5.0;10.0;1859;After a one day turnaround, we received our bed yesterday afternoon and we were able to sleep on it last night.  The box was very large and heavy but my husband was able to move it to the bedroom(We are dreading when we get our bed frame because the fully expanded king mattress will be difficult to move).  After cutting off all the plastic, the bed expanded very quickly and the smell disappeared almost completely by the evening. I would have to say my first night sleep was amazing! I love this bed and would highly recommend it!!!  This is our first memory foam bed and so far so good.  I will keep you posted if there are any changes:);Excellent Purchase!
75;50.0;5.0;19.0;1866;I started looking at this mattress last August and put it on my wish list.  Each month I'd check it out and note the price varied.  In December the price went below $400 (for a full size), so I decided to take a chance after reading the reviews again and again.\n\nThe mattress came in two days.  Though the box was a little damaged, the contents were fine.  I kept the box upright next to the bed and carefully opened it. I was forewarned by one of the reviewers to have it by the bed.  It was heavy, but I tilted it out of the box and onto the bed platform (much easier than trying to lift it from the floor). I turned it so when I removed the first layer of plastic wrap it would unfold in the right direction. I took the outer layer of plastic off and the entire mattress was quite easy to unroll on top of the platform.  Then I carefully removed the shrink wrap.  At this point I couldn't imagine it rising to 14 inches, but it was fun to watch expand as the wrapping came off.  3 hours later I took my measuring tape to it and it had expanded to the full 14 inches.  I decided to wait  24 hours before sleeping on it (recommended time is 48 hours).  It was too difficult to have it in the room and not try it out after 24 hours.\n\nI have suffered from back problems due to an old back injury for the last 30 years.  Though it was different than my old pillow top, my body settled into it and I fell asleep immediately. I have been sleeping on it for nearly a week now, and have enjoyed every second of comfort.\n\nRegarding the smell:  It was quite minimal and only lasted the first day.\nRegarding the firmness:  It is quite firm.  I was afraid it would be too firm.  Yet, once you are on top of it, you feel yourself relax into it.\nRegarding the sheet problem: I had a set of queen size sheets that worked perfectly on the 14 inches.  It's true my full size sheets did not fit.\n\nMy only regret is that it took me from August to December to make this purchase.  Don't hesitate if you are on the fence.;Thrilled with this purchase!
76;42.0;5.0;23.0;1945;"July 2014 update. 18 months in and we love this mattress. No sag, no dents, like climbing into a new bed every night. I would never go back to any other mattress. I have one small gripe, sitting on the edge is tricky. It will compress and slide you off if you don't sit far enough in. Small price for the best damn mattress we've ever owned in my 55 years.\n\n  So far we've had this mattress for a week. We're glad our college aged boys were around to bring this up the spiral stairway into the MBR via the loft area. This sucker weighs 119lbs packaged. Slippery too, from the cussing I heard on the way up. We have twin box springs arranged for the previous king mattress. It fit it very good, no overhang issues others have mentioned. The odor is just now dissipating, strong for the first two nights, hardly noticable now. We let this expand about 6 or 7 hours and were tired so we slept on it the first night. I would say it was 80-85% expanded at that time. The next day we noticed the fitted sheets had crept up the corners so we assumed it is now the full 14"". We did purchase new, deeper sheets for this bed but they hadn't been washed at the time.\nThe first night was ok. Going from a pillow top to this is different. Not bad, just different. I am just now noticing that it is helping with my back. I'm a big guy. 255+ lbs. I first found the bed comfortable, I now find it really, really comfortable. I can actually lay in it in the morning and not have to get up because my back hurts. I'm pleased. Now my wife.... she is still adjusting. She says it's comfortable, but with less conviction. It was her suggestion to purchase as she has chronic back issues with a couple of surgeries under her belt. It really is all about her. Whatever it takes to make her comfortable is just gravy for me. She says she still wakes up in the middle of the night but is able to fall back to sleep right away. She's been in agony for years so any improvement is good. We hope she is still acclimating to the support this bed offers, which we never had with our several thousand dollar name brand pillowtop memory foam mattress. It is now relegated to the spare bed in the rec room.\nWe purchased a soft waterproof mattress cover from Amazon too. It isn't noticable under the sheets. We have young grandkids who often venture in to our bed when stayng over. Better safe than sorry. So far so good. I will revisit this review in a month to let you know how this bed is working out for my better half. So far so good.";Now 18 months with this mattress
77;63.0;4.0;12.0;2020;I got suckered into buying a queen-size Tempurpedic for $4000.-  Yeap, you read that right.  I paid so much I even bought renter's insurance because I was afraid I'd lose it in the rare chance of a fire.  For the price of a decent used-car I bought a mattress.  Later on, I noticed that most memory foam mattresses actually felt the same at Ikea, Bob's, and other furniture stores.  And thanks to the excellent reviews here, I bought this king-sized mattress for $700.-  It stank like crazy for at least three days.  The smell was still strong for about two weeks and would even make our blankets smelly.  We covered it up with a mattress protector and fitted sheet and the smell still comes through.  Fortunately after about a month now, the smell is barely noticeable.  It's the same height as our Queen-sized Tempurpedic so we place them both side by side.  We spoil our ten-month old rotten because he gets the Queen-sized Tempurpedic. While the wife and I sleep on this mattress.  We both barely notice the difference.  We will only buy this brand now rather than a Tempurpedic.  One star off for the smell but this is highly recommended.;"As good as Tempurpedic but at one-fifth the cost; Beware of the smell"
78;19.0;5.0;44.0;2026;"Wow! I've had this mattress for a few nights now and I can honestly say I've never had a better nights sleep (I'm 65 years old so I've had a few nights sleep!). I LOVE this mattress. I have Fibromyalgia and have a hard time remaining in one position very long. The memory foam almost completely eliminates the pain of staying in one position for a length of time.\nThe mattress is heavy and, as with all mattresses, it is bulky so I would recommend having someone else help with unpacking and placement for anything over a twin size mattress (and even that was somewhat of a struggle!). It arrives very compacted (as in vacuum packed) and rolled up so it's not full size when you get it.  Also the instructions say to leave it on a flat surface for 48 hours to fully reach it's normal size. I recommend doing that as it does bulk up over the two days to the 14 inch size. I was very happy with the delivery. It was shipped from Phoenix, AZ on the 11th and arrived in Knoxville, TN on the 13th. Can't beat that.\nThe mattress did have a slight 'new foam' smell when first unwrapped but nothing to be concerned about and the smell went away completely after a couple of days.\nI did a lot of research before ordering this mattress and yes I was somewhat concerned about ordering something so personal as a mattress thru the mail. This is one time I am very happy I went with the majority of reviews and ordered it. I went to a local Bed Store and tried the Temp*#*(%* mattress and frankly the Lucid feels better. Not to mention the vast savings over the Temp*#*(%*. The mattress felt a bit firm at first but it molded to my body very quickly and felt fantastic.\nIf you're looking for a memory foam mattress I would not hesitate to recommend the Lucid 14"" mattress. It a little bit of sleeping heaven right here on earth.\n\n1 Week Later update:\nI was in love with this mattress on day one and every night I fall in love again. This is truly one of the best purchases I have ever made. I haven't slept this well in years. If you are even slightly interested in getting this mattress do not wait - I can (almost) guarantee you will be happy with the purchase.";Why Did I Wait So Long?
79;30.0;5.0;34.0;2030;Wow. Let me say again the bed is awesome! We've had the bed now nearly 4 weeks, so I feel that I can write a fair review.\nOff-gassing, yes, but not horrible and I'm a migraine sufferer so if it doesn't bother me it's not so bad. I can still smell it slightly when I put my nose to the mattress, but it's fading. The first week was the worst.. but as I said it wasn't horrible.\n\nI did weeks and weeks worth of research before buying a mattress. I laid on everything from Serta to Tempur-pedic. Everything from inner spring to latex as well as memory foam and gel foam. I studied memory foam, density, foundation, and composition before buying. I read every review I could find. I knew what I wanted.  I wanted a Tempur-pedic but it simply was not in the budget and I was NOT willing to finance.  This mattress was exactly what I was looking for. It truly does feel like a high end tempur-pedic when you lay on it.  If you are on the fence, or afraid to buy something you haven't laid on.. don't be!  I was scared too, but considering this mattress was at a 90% discount from the cost of the equivalent tempur-pedic mattress, it was worth the risk. A risk that definitely paid off. We couldn't be happier!\n\nMattress sleeps beautifully. Firm but not too firm. Give yourself a week to adjust. It took us about 3 or 4 days to adjust from an innerspring mattress to this one.  I sleep hot like a furnace, but the bed does not sleep hot - a major concern. Let me stress.. the bed does NOT sleep hot! I'm a happy and comfortable girl.  I'm a side sleeper with fibromyalgia and I no longer have hip/shoulder pain from sleeping on my side. No lower back pain either. It's so comfortable!  The pain from my fibro has been reduced greatly.  I still move at night, but not as much and I rarely wake up at night anymore.  My husband is a snorer and you wouldn't believe how much that has reduced. He used to shake the walls! Now he snores rarely.. and softly. Much better. He also reports that the usual aches and pains have diminished since we got this mattress. There also is no motion transfer. When either of us get up or roll over.. the other doesn't feel it at all.\n\nMattress is very heavy and very hard to move around.. like the others said.  Sheets should be deep pocket for a proper fit. Warranty is 25 years! 1.5 inch is the allowed 'imprint' amount. Anything greater is covered under warranty.\n\nNow.. as far as delivery. Item was shipped promptly and I paid the fee for next day because it was available. Mattress did NOT arrive next day (although it could've if it hadn't been held up in Memphis for 12 hours). Then to make matters worse, the FedEx man simply dumped it in my driveway and left. Didn't ring the bell, didn't knock, nothing. I have a nice large covered front porch, but it was still left in the drive where I found it when I walked out, beat up and the box barely hanging around it.  FedEx Failed.. which was no fault of the mattress company.  Don't waste your money on next day delivery.;Simply Awesome!
80;12.0;1.0;51.0;2050;After laying on a lot of mattresses and doing a lot of research this seemed to be the best mattress in our price range.  It is not as soft as most but definately not as firm as the tempurpedic rhapsody.  I also question whether the top layer is really memory foam or 5.3lb density.  It springs back almost as quick as you can move your hand (not like memory foam elsewhere or like the memory foam on the second layer of this bed).  My wife's back and neck pain seem to have been helped so far (first week) but I seem to wake up more than before.  The matress cover feels great and we like the higher bed.  You sink enough into this bed that if you're close to each other you will role into a common canyon (like an air mattress).  We are happy our sheets still fit (though not as well) and are using our old box spring as a base (tag says not to use a foundation-but emailed them and they said any support surface is fine).\n\nIt is now 3 months later and there is probably almost an inch sag where my wife lays (260lbs).  For a mattress that has a 20 year warranty this level of sagging in 3 months proves what I suspected early on-this is not 5lb density foam.  My rating has now moved from 3 stars to 1.  Stay away!;Disappointed
81;2.0;4.0;253.0;2057;"I researched and researched memory foam mattresses.  I read about foam densities, I read about response times.  I read reviews and saw most were great; few were horrid.  I compared and compared.  This is what I got, all at the same time:\n\n14"" Lucid 5.3 lb firm cashmere\n12"" Lucid bamboo\n13"" SpaSensations Channel Quilted\n\nThe 12"" Lucid was like sleeping on dough.  Initially quite cushy, but just didn't have the support.  The 14"" Lucid was fantastic.  The 13"" SpaSensation was a complete and utter failure - it didn't even expand properly and felt like I had just bought an old, regular bed with a hole in the middle.  Our family of 4 tried all of them.  It was quite the experiment!\n\nI love the Lucid 14"" and am buying more of them for our family.  We range from 130-250 lbs and are side/back/belly sleepers.  We like firm support but a nice cushy feel.  It's important to have a memory foam foundation, though.  Either the Malouf Structures foundation or a wood box frame (no coils! just wood) work best.\n\nThere you have it. :)\n\nUPDATE: 3.5 years later, the 12"" softer one developed a hole (120-160lb person sleeping in it) and is no longer suitable.  THIS firmer version, the 5.3 lb 14"" mattress, is still going strong, with a variety of sized people sleeping on it over the years (120-250 lbs).  It is a bit firmer than what I desired, but it's still holding up and the other, softer one is toast, with the hole in the middle causing back pain.  I would buy this one again for the price and durability.\n\nUPDATE: Five years later:\n\n14"" Lucid 5.3 lb firm cashmere  - still have this one on a Malouf foundation and it's made it's rounds with everyone in the family.  Good.\n12"" Lucid bamboo - got rid of last year, as only a 100 lb person could sleep on it (great for a child, though?)\n13"" SpaSensations Channel Quilted - gone\n\nAlso, the fitted mattress pad I used on these was a KEY factor in comfort and made ALL the difference in the world.  I bought a super quilted, thick one at either Walmart or Target (I think it was around 40-60 bucks), and it turns it into a nice, cushy bed with firm support.  I will add that five years later, I do not think the 5.3 lb 14"" Lucid mattress is as firm as it once was.  But it's still very sleepable.";Detailed comparison
82;67.0;4.0;11.0;2058;I went to the tempurpedic store and tried out their lower end firm and extra firm mattresses to help with my sore back.\nI was impressed with their 5lb/ft option (although they do not publish the densities anywhere, the salesman and google told me)\nNot able to stomach the $3K price, I read all the reviews on Amazon and arrived at a twin XL version of this mattress along with a basic frame (which I added a sheet of plywood to provide a stable base).\n\nPros:\n- A little firmer than the tempurpedic equivalent, it took 2-3 nights to adjust. But now I'm fine.\n- A week into it, my back pain upon waking is much less.\n- Build quality fine, quality cover, I got the waterproof cover also, also fine (not detectable).\n- I do feel like I am sleeping significantly sounder and longer.\n\nMinor Nits:\n- Strong latex smell as advertised for 3-4 days. It is still there 8 days later, but getting less everyday. noticeable when coming back to a closed room.\n- its warm, not hot. So instead of a summer quilt, Im just using a sheet as a blanket and its very comfortable. It does get warmer when 2 people are in the bed.\n\nCons:\n- None.\n\nSummary: I feel I got a quality product very comparable to the mainstream expensive brand at a very good price. It arrived in 2 days.;Good Value
83;24.0;5.0;40.0;2060;"We have had the Lucid queen mattress for one week and are very pleased with the purchase.  Like most others, we were reluctant to buy a mattress online but the price (and the positive reviews) convinced us to take the plunge and try memory foam.  The mattress had a moderately strong odor when unpacked which mostly dissipated in a few hours.  After a week there is still a slight odor that is hardly noticeable.  The mattress expanded to about 13"" (final size) in a few hours.  We waited a day to put it on the Charleston queen hardwood bed frame (likewise purchased thru Amazon) which it fit perfectly. Sleeping on my back and side are both very comfortable positions with this mattress. We have not noticed any heat issues while sleeping.\n\nAfter trying the Tempur-pedic mattresses at their store, my opinion is that this mattress is somewhat firmer than the Rhapsody.  It is not super firm, though - my wife hates very firm mattresses and she is very happy with this one.  This mattress is very comfortable but I think I would slightly prefer a Tempur-pedic for maybe $200 more if that were possible.  Since the cheapest Tempur-pedic would cost several thousand dollars more, it is no contest. (Come on, Tempur guys, it's just foam!).  I think this mattress may be one 3-inch topper away from total sleeping perfection, but I also doubt we will bother to try to improve it.  Bottom line: I think you will enjoy this purchase hopefully for years to come.";Excellent Value

85;55.0;4.0;15.0;2077;"I waited a while to submit this review. I encourage anyone who is looking to buy anything so personal as a mattress to do your research and look for what you know you like. I read many reviews and did a lot of research. I tried out all kinds of beds at different stores. I hesitated from switching from the traditional spring style mattress for a long time. Although I do think that there are better mattresses out there; I am not willing to pay for them (perhaps if I were independently wealthy, now that's a dream). I do have chronic off and on back pain, and although I would love to say that switching my mattress fixed that it is not so, and I was not expecting it considering the problem (yes I am one of the weirdos who will sleep on the floor when I am really uncomfortable, some my best nights sleeps have been on camping trips). I do sleep soundly on this mattress, and the bed is comfortable though a different feel from the traditional (kinda soft and firm at the same time). I can tolerate side sleeping better with the foam style of mattress if that is any help to prospective buyers. Yes there is some odor when unpacking but it shouldn't bother most, only those with chemical sensitivities or those who object to ""new"" smells. It dissipates. I purchased a base to go with it. For the price it is a wonderful bed and an amazing deal.";Sleeping well on this mattress.
86;7.0;5.0;79.0;2079;"Ordered this one yesterday after reading about a dozen other memory foam beds available on Amazon. Was initially skeptical as any buy should be when ordering an object that is used for everyday comfort and health...\n\nThe bed arrived with minor scuffs on the cardboard but nothing that penetrated the plastic surrounding the mattress itself. It was pretty heavy - so much that the FedEx guy asked me to help him carry it to the door (he did offer to carry it into the bedroom but I figured he's busy enough).\nOnce again, it's pretty heavy even when it's rolled up like an over sized cake roll - you probably want some help to get it setup for maximum ease or have a practical knowledge of physics.\n\nI tossed it on the box spring that used to hold our spring style mattress, opened up the plastic on one side, and slid the plastic off the other end without any problems. It immediately began decompressing. After approximately 5 hours it was almost pretty huge and my wife and I gave it a test run. I thought it was great! Our other mattress was a thick pillow-top that had suffered from having a valley in its center from extensive use. This mattress provided enough support to take pressure off of my back yet it was soft enough to feel well-cushioned.\n\nOh, the smell. It's only been airing out for approximately five hours now but I hardly notice it - the wife says it smells like a chemical womb... we'll probably be sleeping in the guest bed tonight just so it can have more time to air out. The card that comes with the mattress states that you're supposed to give it 48 hours to expand and air out which seems reasonable.\n\nI'll give it an update after we had a night's sleep on it but I almost fell asleep on it during the test run...\n\nso far - great! I don't believe you can find a mattress for this price unless it fell off a truck and a hobo was selling it for booze.\n\n**Update 5/29/2012\n\nSlept a full night on this bed two nights in a row. If you've purchased this bed and find that it's too firm, try removing any fitted sheets or top sheets that you may have usually slept with and just sleep directly on the mattress cover. The cover itself is very comfortable and appears to help the mattress form better to your body. The fitted sheets I had for our previous mattress were pretty snug when I attempted to utilize them on this mattress and caused the mattress to not conform to your body as well.\n\nWe both slept great the past two nights! Before the troubles with our current mattress, I generally only slept 5-6 hours a night and felt well-rested. When the troubles slowly began, I was increasingly sleeping 8-10 hours (of broken sleep) and still feeling groggy in the morning. That's pretty much gone now - slept a very good 6 hours of unbroken sleep and woke up refreshed and invigorated. So much so that I had to write this review almost immediately after taking the garbage and recycling out to the curb ;)\n\nWould highly recommend so long as you give the mattress its recommended 48 hours to expand and 'fumigate' in a well ventilated room.\n\n**Update 02/21/2013\n\nStill loving it. The quality of the mattress hasn't diminished at all. Doesn't cause pressure pain on any part of the body. No noticeable sag. The mattress cover is still soft and enjoyable to sleep directly on. My wife finds it to be more firm than she'd like but when she spends a night on the older fancy soft spring mattress, she comes back to this one because her hips hurt from sleeping on springs -- I have my share of upper back problems and the LUCID mattress helps to not further aggravate them.";Replaced a fancy-pants spring mattress
87;14.0;5.0;50.0;2095;"We also were reluctant to purchase a mattress online like several reviewers here.  We ""tried out"" many memory foam mattresses at local stores: Temperpedic Cloud (nice, but WAAAAAAAY over priced), I-Comfort (Sealy or Serta?? can't remember, nice but still too much $$$$$), and Original Mattress Factory (not bad for a new product line, but still too expensive).  Some of the negative reviewers wonder ""what we're smoking"" to give this product a good review.  Not smoking anything and sleeping great.  Saved enough money to redecorate our bedroom as we moved up from a Queen to a King, so all new linens, etc.. for us.\n\nYes, there is a bit of a smell or odor, but not any more than the typical foam mattress toppers you can buy at Walmart.  After a week or so it wasn't noticeable at all.  I guess it's all in personal preferences and what you make of it.  Yes, it's a bit on the ""firm"" side, so if you need more cushy-cushy, maybe this isn't for you.  I waited 2 weeks before writing this so we could honestly give our opinion. We thought it might be too hard, but it is fine for us.  Again, personal preference.\n\nHaving a husband that is extremely handy, he made a platform for the mattress himself, saving us more. But that is just because he likes to do that kind of thing and he's good at it.  Lucky me.\n\nSo, yes, we purchased this memory foam mattress based on the reviews, and I'm so glad we did.  Thank you Amazon for the free shipping.\n\nI hope this helps someone who is considering taking the risk to buy a mattress online.  Happy sleeping!!";We read the reviews, now for mine...great deal for the money
88;57.0;5.0;14.0;2095;I bought two sizes full and twin. Both mattresses were great! I bought a different one from BJ's and it was nice too but I paid double and the BJ's one had problems bulking up after compression (2 full weeks to get to full size). The ones listed on this site were at full shape in 20 minutes (WOW)! The chemical smell was the same for all three at just a few days and not too bad on the smell. You have to accept that foam mattresses just smell funny for about a week or so but it does go away. The shipping on the twin mattress was overnight, and the full one was about a week to ship. I would buy this again. I would also tell my friends to buy this mattress and from this on-line retailer.;Great Mattress! Great Price!!
89;39.0;5.0;26.0;2097;I waited over a month to write this review.  I was confident buying this mattress because it had great reviews.  It was shipped quickly and came right to my door.  I actually was able to use the box as added protection between the frame slats and the mattress. It was a perfect fit. I have to say since the first night, I have had no back pain. It's a miracle!!  It is a firm bed, but very comfy. I don't find it any warmer than the previous mattress.  There was a slight odor when I first opened it, but it was not overwhelming and was gone in a couple days.  Love,  love, live this!!;Great mattress!
90;71.0;1.0;10.0;2099;Bought this mattress simply because it had high ratings(bs inflated high ratings by the manufacturer i'm guessing) also because it was the thickest and most expensive one made by lucid. BIGGGG MISTAKE! Was anxiously awaiting this bed to arrive since our mattress was almost 10 years old and had developed divots where we laid. First night i thought maybe it was going to take some time to break this mattress in... I was WRONG.  My wife ordered a mattress topper thinking that would make this mattress more bearable. It didn't! I also want to comment that this mattress has absolutely no give what soever. I weight 185 and I would only sink in maybe a 1/2 inch to and inch....? Also at the time of this review I notice they changed the title of this mattress from a PLUSH to a FIRM. Should say SUPER FIRM! So after a week of the worst sleep I had ever had in MY LIFE, I decided to go mattress shopping/researching and found a comparable Tempur knock off that was well worth the $. Before you ask its call the ellis bay. can google it. Ended up buying it and shipped this one back to amazon minus the shipping cost i was out around $90 for return shipping. Wasn't going to lose all my $. The only thing I have to say is Amazon made it a breeze for me to return this with a big item shipper.\n\n  So if your interested in a mattress that is hard as a board this is a good fit for you. Not too sure what other reviewers are smoking but there is no possible way this could be comfortable night sleep for anyone in there right mind.  So buyer beware its a hard mattress!;A 4x8 sheet of PLYWOOD would be MORE comfortable!!!!!
91;109.0;5.0;5.0;2101;"Although the shipping took a little longer than I expected,I have to say that this being my first memory foam mattress, it is definitely worth the switch from any spring mattress.  I feel like I do sleep a bit more soundly as I used to wake up multiple times throughout the night due to tossing and turning, but that has been cut down to only a couple.  This mattress is extremely comfortable, and is not like ""sleeping on the floor"" as some reviews have mentioned, however it is defnitely not the softest of mattresses by any means, but me being extremely tall (6'9"" 235 lbs.) it holds me and conforms to my body very well.  Do keep in mind that it is not the standard queen size (it is slightly bigger), which is a plus for me considering my size, it just makes it difficult to match up to a normal queen-sized box spring.";Great Mattress
92;15.0;5.0;47.0;2103;"It was new mattress time at our house. I've gotten incredibly lucky with the last two beds I bought... however, the price of mattresses seems to have skyrocketed. I can't stand pillow tops... everyone I know that bought a pillow top, hates it. I like a firmer mattress, and my husband and I are big people. I need something sturdy and comfortable. I have a memory foam pillow and I can't sleep without it. I wanted a memory foam bed. But they are all THOUSANDS of dollars, even on sale... right? Not the Lucid.\n\nI researched memory foam mattresses all over the internet... learned about the different qualities and densities. I kept eyeing up the ones at Ikea, but they scared me because they were so thin and had no box spring. Well, the Lucid also needs no box spring! But the 14"" model doesn't worry me at all with the thickness. I chose the 14"" because it had 4 layers of foam and the best ""density"" rating of that foam.\n\nThe box is big and heavy, and the mattress is very heavy when it unfolds. Not a problem, but you need two able bodied people to move it around. There was a faint chemical smell for a couple days... it went away. It's the same smell my pillow had when I first bought that. I'm pretty sensitive to scent (I get migraines from some) but honestly after a day I hardly noticed it, and now it's gone.\n\nI am quite pleased with this mattress. It takes a little getting used to... the first night I couldn't sleep because I was TOO COMFORTABLE. Now it's not an issue. I'm full-chested and I can actually lay comfortably on my stomach. I couldn't do that for more than a minute on my old bed. I am mostly a side or back sleeper... and my husband says I usually toss and turn a lot. Not any more!\n\nOnly bad part about this bed is getting out of it... haha. No really, sometimes it's a little hard when you've been laying and you're all ""sucked in"" to it. You have to roll out, not scooch. And yes, it is a little too comfortable and you may not want to get up in the morning.\n\nI'm telling everyone about this bed. Don't pay thousands for Tempurpedic! This bed is AWESOME. And I am REALLY hard to please. And cheap. :)\n\nI was undecided on the bed frame (it needs a special frame, no box spring, or a platform bed like Ikea sells)... so right now it's directly on the floor. But we'll probably be buying the frame or a new bed from Ikea soon.\n\n[We did also purchase the waterproof cover. Mostly because when throwing out my OLD mattress, I was embarrassed how gross it looked.]";Temper-who? GREAT bed, GREAT price. Best mattress for big people!

I don't lay awake all night tossing and turning trying to find a comfortable position, in fact my wife told me that I did not turn once last night. The ""old"" mattress we had was a 2 year old Sealy Posturepedic Mattress with a 4 inch foam topper on it, in fact the money I made from selling that mattress paid for this one, just so you know.\n\nThe mattress did not have any odor to it at all, in fact I took a little 4 hour nap on it an hour after I unpacked it! The mattress also fit our bed frame perfect even though the frame has sides on it that the mattress had to fit down into.\n\nI would highly recommend this mattress to anyone who has a hard time sleeping on a regular spring mattress.\n\nP.S This was the Queen Sized Mattress.";Best Bed I  Have Ever Had!!
94;65.0;1.0;12.0;2110;no one can possibly feel that this thing is comfortable in anyway. its about as comfortable as laying on the floor, it has no give when you lay out on it. it gives a good bit when you kneel/sit on the edge of it. but when your weight is distributed (laying down)across it there is no give at all. i lay on my side normally and when i do in this mattress i wake up off and on all night because my arm is asleep. never had that in my old 20+ year old crappy mattress. THE worst thing i have ever slept on in my life! and thats coming from some one that had to sleep on the floor for a few weeks when i moved into my first apartment.;the reviews for this product HAS to be a scam by the manufacturer or something
95;10.0;3.0;54.0;2110;"Ok. So I have had this a couple weeks so far. I am honestly telling you how I feel about it and if anything changes then I will update the review.\n\nSo. I ordered the full size. It came in a very long box but it was packaged well. Very heavy. The FedEx man told me it weighed 75lbs so he put it inside the door for me. I was able to roll this awkwardly end over end to my bedroom by myself. However, I would for sure not try to move this on your own. It is a two person job. I was able to do it but I paid dearly for it because I have a bad wrist.\n\nAnyway. It is rolled up like a burrito. There is thick plastic rolled around the mattress and then the mattress itself is in its own vacuum sealed plastic. Be very careful when you cut the plastic because you could easily nick the mattress. Once the plastic is cut from the outside, you have to cut the vacuum sealed part next. This is also a 2 person job because you have to cut the one side then flip it and cut the other side to get it completely uncovered. I also did this myself but, like I said, I don't recommend it. Also, I'd use scissors and not a box cutter. Scissors makes it easier to not nick the mattress by pointing the scissors upward as you cut.\n\nImmediately, I would say it expanded to 60% its full size. Like everyone else has stated, it is very good quality. The price is unbeatable and I don't think you could get better quality even if you paid 2-3x more for a name brand. The cover that comes with it is nice quality, too. Very thin but good quality. I wish they would also include like a plastic cover for it to protect the mattress better or even just add a plastic coating to the included cover. I didn't deduct stars for this because most mattresses don't include a free cover. None that I've bought.\n\nI let it expand for the full 2 days suggested. I slept on my couch. It does expand to a full 15 inches. Usually mattresses or futon mattresses never expand to the size that is claimed before you buy it.\n\nSomeone else said it feels too stiff or is like laying on a brick. It was like that for the first couple days but now it has softened and is more flexible than it was initially. It is very firm, though, so don't buy this is you are wanting a pillowy soft mattress.\n\nOne of the things I'm deducting points for is because it has developed an indentation where I normally sleep. I could understand if I had had it for months but I think it's too soon to have an indentation. I am fat lol but still it should fill itself out better. That's why I paid extra for the 15"" instead of the 9"" but it doesn't seem to have made a difference.\n\nAnother thing, it seems to hold heat and cold more than a regular mattress. If it's warm, the mattress absorbs the heat and I get hot because of that. When it's cold, the mattress stays cold even if I've been lying on it for awhile. When it's cold, the mattress is firmer. When it's hot, it seems to be more cushiony. So it is inconsistent in that regard. Normally if it's really cold and you lay in bed for awhile, your body heat warms up the mattress. This doesn't happen on this memory foam.\n\nIt has helped my back pain a little but not as much as it has for other reviewers. I actually slept on an air mattress for the month before I bought this and the air mattress was more comfortable than this mattress is which is disappointing.\n\nSo. Great quality. It reaches the thickness that it is supposed to. But still I'm disappointed. Due to all the other rave reviews, I expected more. I don't regret the purchase but it is just average for me. Maybe after some more time it will work the problems out.\n\nIf you have never slept on memory foam, don't buy this. You need to know what you're getting. Go to a local store and just test out a memory foam and see if you like it. Don't just blindly make the purchase like I did. If you like memory foam already, then I don't think the quality or price can be beat. But customers need to understand that memory foam is not soft and cushiony like pillow-tops.\n\nMore than anything, it feels like you are lying in sand. If you've ever been to the beach you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nOh, and it is basically true to size length wise. Width wise there may be an inch wider than most fulls. This is the bed I use and I would recommend it if you want something light and simple. I wrote a review for the bed, too:\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Structures-by-Malouf-HIGHRISE-Folding-Metal-Bed-Frame-14-High-Bi-Fold-Platform-Bed-Base-FULL/dp/B000ZQALJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Structures by Malouf HIGHRISE Folding Metal Bed Frame 14"" High Bi-Fold Platform Bed Base, FULL</a>";A little disappointed but I don't regret the purchase.

I can no longer justify keeping the mattress and have downgraded from 2 stars to 1. I have also contacted amazon and they are scheduling a ""large item transport"" company to come to my house and pick up the mattress. My suggestion... don't buy a mattress that you haven't laid down on.";Far from plush
100;3.0;5.0;257.0;2141;"We ordered this mattress last week, it was shipped from Commerce City, Colorado, to us here in Wichita, KS in two days (the ordering is what took so long, but the shipping was quick Thursday showed shipped and Friday it arrived).\n  The box is huge! It was very heavy even for my hunky husband. The box was very damaged obviously. With something this large and heavy, it can't be avoided at all. However, it was obvious the mattress was well wrapped and just fine upon arrival. It was marked KING and LUCID all over the box and was obvious that it was the correct item.\n  It had been raining here for the past week nonstop and I was worried if I wasn't home when it arrived that it would get soaked. However it was wrapped sooo well in plastic, I know I wouldn't have had anything to worry about. The UPS man heaved it into my garage for me on a dolly. It arrived in the morning around 1030 am (and it wasn't raining at that time).\n  DH took the mattress box all the way to the bedroom, it was easier to do that than take the mattress out. It had two nylon straps he was able to grab to pull it. He put the mattress roll on the bed and popped the plastic it began to expand quickly. You could smell the ""new paint"" smell but it definitely was not overwhelming by any means. We had readied the windows and fan, but it wasn't necessary. The plastic wrap held the paint smell in so I know that it was sealed well. To me it just smelled new and after about a half hour you had to put your nose on the mattress to smell that ""paint"" smell at all.\n  It was expanded almost to 14 inches tonight around 10 pm. The last few inches are taking the longest. But right away the mattress was expanded to about 8 to 10 inches (with in about 5 to 10 mins). It expands at different rates so one side of the bed was higher than the other at first, but it's evened out just fine.\n  We had the mattress turned wrong as in upside down, as you want the plain cashmere side to be down, and the fancy stitched side that says, ""cashmere"" and ""Lucid"" stitched all over it upwards to the ceiling. ALSO, we had the foot and head sideways on the bed too, so it had to be turned one more direction to sit right on the bed. But you can figure all that out pretty quickly...lol  Do it before it expands too much, it's much easier obviously.\n  I put sheets on it and am sleeping on it tonight as I have no choice really, but I think in the morning it should be close to 14 inches. I have pictures and hopefully the video which you will be able to see.\n  I do believe if you want to seriously consider memory foam this is a good way to go, I don't know about it's longevity yet. But the foam base it the largest out there- I looked at every single memory foam mattress that is being manufactured and that's not a joke. You need a big dense foam base for these beds. Also if you want to go the Tempurpedic route as far as denisty 5 lb density or 7 pound density, this is comparible. We laid on the Tempurpedic beds in the store and compared their composition to this bed. I might get a 6 lb 2 inch memory foam topper for it as I prefer it to be really firm. The Allura is 7 lbs and 5 lbs memory foam, the closest topper I could find was 6 pounds. It costs about $500 too. So even with this mattress and that mattress topper, I am still WAAAAAY under the cost of the Allura Tempurpedic  which is almost $5000!\n  We also tried all the other major name brands of memory foam. The other companies like Serta, or Sleep Innovations really don't compare. Their densities are much lower and the bases much shorter and in my opinion too small. I even looked at Bed in a Box (although a good company), their beds don't boast a higher density foam, and dont' have a deeper base, I believe they use 3 pounds or less for their memory foam. The Dynasty mattresses are a better buy here on Amazon if you are considering one of those. Just look at how the mattress is made and see for yourself. I called Dynasty and spoke to a very nice man and he answered all my questions as well. They go 1.5"" on their 20 year warranty.\n  Most companies I found don't list the density of their foam bases, so that's the only unknown. I couldn't even find that with Tempurpedic's mattresses. I think minimum for two regular sized adults (my husband 6 foot and 210) and I am 5'6 and pregnant (no need to go there) that 12 inches minimum is what you need. Anything else would not be adequate from what I read.\n  I have been through 2 mattress on warranties in 4 years- from a different company and store (NOT THIS MATTRESS), so I am super paranoid. We aren't even trying to go warranty this last mattress as we don't even want to deal with it. The first time we did the warranty process was easy and we had it done with in a week, but it's just the trouble of hauling it around and taking pictures and being pregnant, I just don't have the energy. I just want a good nights sleep ;)\n  So basically if you want a good memory foam, compare heights, densities and bases. Go from there. I am crossing my fingers that this thing will hold up through the years. I will try to update and answer questions if I remember. I really appreciated the folks who already wrote detailed reviews and one guy even put up a video on another LUCID I think.\n  Oh and the warranty card was stuck right there to the mattress. It states the typical 1.5"" sag, but there are no other stipulations about the 20 year warranty. Bed in a box is 1.25"" and Tempurpedic is .75"".  So although they have LinenSpa beat there I still went with this mattress. I even called LinenSpa during regular business hours and someone answered the phone and answered my questions.\n  Be back soon with more info. I really do hope this helps someone else out, even if you don't buy this brand, at least maybe it will educate you a little.

102;58.0;4.0;14.0;2144;"I'll also say that I was skeptical buying a mattress this way! The box it comes in (queen size) is heavy but relatively compact. I had to move it myself but managed to wrestle it out of the box, unrolled it on the bed (I used my old foundation), and then cut off the plastic. The mattress makes a hissing sound at first as it expands. The instructions say to let it expand on a flat surface for up to 48 hours, but that was not practical for me. I don't have that kind of empty floor space. Within 5 or 6 hours it had expanded to about 12"" and when it finally finished it is about 13"".\n\nI wanted to wait a couple of weeks before writing a review. I will say that I have found the mattress to be very hard. I am hoping it will soften up over time. I do not find it especially hot. The smell did not bother me. It smells like any other memory foam pillow or mattress topper. I had an old foam topper on my old mattress that I transferred to the new one. The ""cashmere"" cover has plenty of space inside so I put the topper right on top of the mattress, inside the cover. That has made things a good bit more comfortable.\n\nOne of the major drawbacks of this mattress is that it is oversize. It barely fits in my frame between the headboard and footboard. My sheets didn't fit, not just because of the thickness but primarily because it is oversize. I got some 21"" deeeep pocket sheets which do fit.\n\nMy old mattress was a pillow top that developed a giant divot in the middle within the first 18 months or so. It cost a small fortune. So even if this foam mattress wears out in a couple of years I think it is still a bargain. But I don't necessarily expect it to do that. I can't say it's the greatest sleep ever or anything like that. But I do believe that my back pain is a bit less.";quite firm to start
103;20.0;5.0;45.0;2149;Well I will get straight to the point. This bed is Great. I am still getting used to it, but it's still better than my old pillow top. for the price you cant even tell its not that big name brand. and with your own sheets on it, nobody else can tell either. the first thing we did was wait the recomended 48 hours to let it expand. it was at 13.5 inches in just a few hours, but we decided to follow the directions. we took the cashmere cover off and let the bed air out while we washed the cover. there is a smell its not horrible, but it is there. and it's still there now after one week. hopefully it will go away at some point. I pushed my hand into the bed and it left a perfect implant just like the tempur***** commercial. when you lay on the bed you kind of sink into it. but it is firm and supportive. best of both worlds I guess.  if you want a memory foam bed and don't want to spend thousands of dollar$.....  get this one.....;Tempur who?
104;43.0;5.0;24.0;2154;"Received as promised, in a box that would make one think ""no WAY is there a 14"" bed in there"". We opened, placed on our existing bedframe that has been modified to a platform. In our opinion it is not too firm. I have already noticed a reduction in body aches less than a week in. As for the off-gassing? It seems to be dissapating. I moved a Peace Lily that I had in the house into the bedroom since they are said to help absorb off-gassing. Warm? Oh you better believe it, but so far not intolerably so. It was a leap of faith to buy a bed online. I don't regret my decision.";Wow!
105;40.0;5.0;26.0;2156;"Wow! What can I say about this amazing mattress besides the fact that its amazing and the best mattress I have every had the privilege of sleeping on. I am extremely difficult when it comes to my creature comforts especially my bed/pillows. I previously had a memory foam mattress that was only about 8"" high and had been going the way of the Dodo so I decided to look for a new mattress to replace it, luckily for me the great and mighty Amazon had just what I needed. If you're like me and looking for a mattress that's extremely high and very full then look no further. I haven't had a chance to measure it but it looks even higher then 14"", which I am completely OK with. I will say the only ""negative"" I would have to point out is that it's so wide I think it's about two inches or so wider then a standard Full. I only say this because I have to now buy a different box spring to support it because my previous bed frame is designed to have the mattress lay inside of the fixture instead of on a flatter unobstructed bed frame. With this said I am still overjoyed with my purchase and the great price alone is worth it. My previous cheaply made mattress cost about $150 more then this one and I have a feeling this will last longer then the previous. The feel of the mattress has a great combination of support and comfort as one reviewer previously stated when you first get on the bed its firm, then like magic you start to sink in and it conforms to your body like a glove. I'm a back and side sleeper so sleeping on my back was a dream and when I switched to sleep on my side to test it out the mattress conformed to my body appropriately. Hopefully this helps with making your mattress purchase but I can't compliment this amazing mattress more, your body will thank you with the best coma like sleep you have ever had!";Thank you baby Jebus for this mattress!!!!
106;68.0;4.0;11.0;2159;Where has this bed been all my life? Yes, it's a bit smelly at first, though after three days it's barely noticeable. And I put another mattress pad on top of the one it comes with as I was afraid of feeling too hot. When you first lie on it, it feels overly firm, but in a few minutes you notice your body melting in nicely. It's been years since I have slept this well, and woken this pain free.\n\nMy only caveat is that the mattress is bigger than my furniture bed frame so it doesn't fit down in it right. I wanted to have it fit lower on slats, but I had to leave it on my old bed's box springs. With the box springs and the depth of the mattress, it makes the whole thing pretty high up!;Aahhhhhhh...
107;31.0;5.0;35.0;2169;"Order shipped the same day.  Upon arrival, opened up the packaging and the mattress expanded to just under 14"" in about 5 hours.  (It was cold here when delivered).  The dimensions are within 1/2"" of correct size, so no problems there. Yes, there is a smell, and if you are hyper sensitive to every smell it might bother you.  For me, it was just another ""new item"" smell that wore off in a couple days.  I will refrain from saying the mattress is soft or hard since everyone's opinion is different on that.  The bed is very comfortable, very supportive, and not overly warm (though warmer than our previous pillowtop innercoil mattress).  The specs are not published but I would guess the top layer has an ILD of about 14.  (takes 14 lbs over 50in2 to compress the top layer 25%) The feel is similar to the tempur rhapsody.  The cover does not fit perfectly, but is not bad either.  It is a bit loose which is better than too tight I would guess.  The cover does have a nice feel.  For the price, this is a great deal so long as it lasts a few years.  If you haven't slept on a memory foam mattress before, give it some time.  It is a different feel.  Make sure you have appropriate pillows as well and enjoy the restful dreams of having such a great bed for such a great price.";What a great deal!
108;21.0;5.0;45.0;2175;I did my research on several of the memory foam mattress and this was the least expensive and I love it! I had it the next day and slept on it the same night and had a great night sleep. A lot of people wrote about the smell, I did not notice anything at all, not even when we took it out the package. I have slept on a tempupedic before and this is by far better! Love that it has a cover that I am able to unzip and wash. This mattress is worth every penny.;Couldn't be happier
109;4.0;5.0;143.0;2183;"I was super sckeptical about buying this mattress.  I have been shopping for a new mattress for about a month now.  I have been sleeping on a pillow top Denver mattress for the last eight years or so.  It was a great mattress but it was time for a new one.\n\nI read reviews on the LUCID as well as Sealy's version and of course...the Temupurpedic.  For the most part everyone had basically the same experience.  Some people complained about getting hot.  Some people said it was too hard. Some people said it was too soft.\n\nHere is what I have learned.  I think it boils down to preference.  If you wanna test this mattress out, go down to your local mattress store and take a spin on the Tempurpedic that costs four times as much.  I honestly don't think that I can tell the difference.  If you like the Tempurpedic, buy this mattress.  You'll save a couple grand and sleep very well.\n\nThe mattress is heavy...know that. Moving, unpacking and setting up this mattress is a two person job.\n\nMany people talk about a ""chemical"" smell when first unwrapping.  It's there.  No doubt.  That said, I set mine up, opened the windows and closed my bedroom door to let it air out for the afternoon.  I came back home and it was good to go.\n\nThis mattress is going to be a VERY different sleep experience from a traditional mattress.  That said, I have had mine for a couple nights now and it has been the best two nights of sleep that I have had in a long time.  I'll never go back.";Best quality mattress that I have seen for this price...period!

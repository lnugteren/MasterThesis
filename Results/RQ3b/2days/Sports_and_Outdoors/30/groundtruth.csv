0;3.0;5.0;6.0;0;This is good meter.  We had to replace it after its sensitity switch went bonkers. We bought the same model.\n\nIt worked every day for four years. I think it served us well.;Digiwalker is a winner
1;7.0;2.0;10.0;75;Pros: it's really cheap, and has a lot of features (set stride length, calories, clock, backlight, protective door)\n\nCon: the door is really, incredibly, intolerably hard to open.  I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open.  I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open.  It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed.\n\nAlso, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count.  I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open.\n\nFor the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it.;O.k., but I can't get the door open!
2;10.0;3.0;11.0;104;"Excellent features, replaceable battery that is easy to find. HOWEVER, the first time I dropped it on the bathroom floor it was toast. So, be careful with it and it will do you well. The only other thing I did not like was that it has an audible ""click"" with every step. Other people can notice it.";Good but not sturdy
3;20.0;4.0;6.0;109;"I was really enjoying my Oregon Scientific Pedometer, I found it easy to use and accurate; however, after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor, and that was it, it no longer works...I will probably buy another one, but it needs to be treated with kid-gloves.";I like it but...
4;22.0;3.0;8.0;254;I finally got around to spending the time to figure out how to program this item, and then I dropped it on a cement surface.  It hasn't worked since, so I threw it out.  If you're careful, this would probably be a great item.;Nice - but don't drop it
5;26.0;2.0;5.0;265;"Unlike another reviewer whose review I read, I found this pedometer to be inaccurate.  It indicates many more steps than I actually take and is off by over a tenth of a mile in distance walked.  I was especially disappointed when I learned that a friend and his fiance had purchased a different pedometer (for the same price as I paid for this one) that records their steps and distance travelled extremely accurately, even though they are completely different in height/weight characteristics.  Moreover, theirs has a ""talking"" feature which tells them how many steps they have taken, etc. And, it looks nicer, with a black and silver case.";Lacks accuracy and short on features
6;24.0;1.0;7.0;273;I love using a pedometer and recommend the simplicity and ease of use of this OS model... However, after buying many for friends and family I have to note the calibration is highly inconsistent.  My husband kept bragging he was doing between 20,000 and 30,000 steps every day and I couldn't figure out how since I have a hard time getting in 10,000 steps a day without  including a daily cardio workout.  I wore both pedometers for a few days with the same settings and his is calculating 3X the steps as mine.  I later learned a pedometer I had given as a gift was also over counting steps as well.  Also the newer models are very difficult to open.;Inconsistent!!
7;19.0;2.0;10.0;282;I ordered this product because of the great reviews that I read about it online. Once it was delivered, however, I was extremely disappointed with the purchase. First of all, I find it very hard to open. It requires a lot of force and is even more awkward to open when it is placed on a waistband (versus just holding it in your hands). I was also surprised that, not only is there no way to turn it off- it is constantly on and wasting batteries, but after leaving it on my dresser overnight I woke up to find out that it had walked 27 steps on its own while I was sleeping! Pretty amazing, huh? I am very disappointed in this product and surprised by all of the other reviews. Hopefully this one is just defective!;Very Disappointing Product...
8;27.0;4.0;5.0;288;"I tried several relatively inexpensive pedometers ($5-$15) and was disappointed in their accuracy.  This Oregon Scientific PE316CA has been the best I have tried.  It has a sensitivity slide, which the others did not have.  This feature allows you to set the sensitivity to the energy of your stride.  (The others didn't record steps if I was sauntering easily, only when I was ""power walking."")\n\nI have not had trouble with the snap opening the display, as others have reported.  The digital display is large and easy to read.  The time is always displayed, along with either steps or miles walked, or Calories expended (set by entering your body weight).  The distance of your step can also be set, whereas some of the other models use a default setting only.\n\nI have only a few quibbles.  Although the advertising indicates that you can use either a 12- or 24-hour clock, the instructions indicate only 12-hour.  Also, the distance display is given only in miles.  You cannot set kilometres if you prefer.";Best Pedometer in Its Class I Have Had
9;21.0;4.0;10.0;381;i bought this because at my job i do a great deal of walking and just wanted an idea of how much i actually do walk. this device seems to over-count what you walk, but it has a sensitivity button on it to counter that. it counts calories, steps, and distance. the backlight is a neat little extra, as well as the clock. it is a small unit, so you don't realize you have it on half the time. but if you want a little extra fun in your life and are curious how much you move throughout the day, you should hook on of these up.;makes my day more fun!!
10;13.0;2.0;18.0;479;Well I was all ready to give this product a decent review but ends up it isn't worth it. It is hard to open but I can live with that. Some of the buttons are not that responsive as you can't flip back and forth from distance to steps to calories that easy. It seems not to like that very much. However it was doing the job. I tested it out several times and it was only off by a couple of steps on each test. On average though it was very accurate. No phantom steps and no counting while i was sitting. I would test 100 steps at a time and it came within 1-5 steps. This made me happy as  this is what I bought it for. So why only 2 stars? Well as soon as it reached 1000 steps the readout went extremely dim. I switched modes and it was fine but when I went back to steps it was dim again. I reset it to 0 and it was ok again. I ran a few tests and each time it went over 999 it dimmed out to a point where I couldn't tell what the numbers were. did I walk 2340 steps or 3246 steps? Now that is a big difference. Now put that big issue with the smaller ones and this product just doesn't cut it. Too bad because it was accurate, light, and compact. I'm taking it back and trying another product. With all the other bad reviews the chances of you picking a good one looks 50/50. This company has to really look at this product because selling something with a track record like this is not right.;Could have been good but dimmed out....
11;6.0;2.0;27.0;512;I threw it out the window, ran over it with my car, beat it with a hammer, put it down the garbage grinder and it just will not cease to exist.  Sure, it doesn't work anymore... but it never did!  The thing would add a hundred steps if I just looked at it the wrong way.  If I actually tried to use it while walking, it informed me that I had travelled to the moon and back while driving over to get a take-out pizza.  Listen, a lot of reviewers seem to be excusing the shabbiness of the product by extolling its price.  In that case, yeah, the rock I found on the beach doesn't keep very good time but you can't beat the price!  I mean listen, people, if you are happy with a pedometer mostly because you paid little for it, you need to admit that you are just a cheapskate.  If you are not interested in accuracy, why measure at all?  And pedometers are notoriously inaccurate, despite what their manufacturers would have you believe.  For one thing, you can blow me with that stride length malarkey.  A person's stride length is in a state of flux and is especially not well represented by the stiff, self-conscious steps you take when you are trying to determine your stride length.  Ever hear of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, baby doll?  Well, I don't wanna get too technical on you.  The whole pedometer concept is for the birds, you dig?  If you cheapskates are serious about measuring distance, why don't you open that wallet that makes a sound like a creaking door in an old horror movie and bats fly out of it and once you have cleared away the cobwebs, take out your credit card and place an order for a Polar or Nike SDM.  That's Speed and Distance Monitor.  These are accurate to 97% even without calibration.  But, oh, prepare yourself for a coronary:  they cost a little more than the pedometer you got at McDonalds with your Happy Meal.  Sorry.;indestructible!!
12;8.0;3.0;27.0;551;I just got this pedometer. I have tested it while walking. On its lowest setting it overestimates my steps by about 5 to 10 percent. I have tested it about 10 times each time taking more than 100 steps outdoors. Everytime it has overestimated by that much. I am not very happy about it.\nWell now after 3 weeks of use it has stopped functioning right. It now overestimates my steps by around 30 to 40 percent. I am going to give it back.;not very accurate
13;12.0;1.0;23.0;632;I've got blisters on my thumb from trying to open this pedometer.\n\nI have suspicions that it isn't really accurate, but I can't tell\n\nbecause I can't get the thing open.  (I'd like to check it several\n\ntimes a day, but my thumb hurts.  Ouch!);Very Difficult to Open
14;18.0;1.0;16.0;645;This product was never reliable. The battery did not fit properly and would lose contact.;Quit working right away
15;9.0;2.0;31.0;772;"The price of this product is what sold me comparing to other pedometers.  I bought it being aware of the problems other reviewers have stated.  The ""happiness"" ratio seems about 40% at best.  The thumb clip has been problematic but you can work around it.  But is that what you want in a product?  The biggest flaw I have found is in its accuracy. After several tests of 50 steps the unit averaged being ""off"" by being over 40 steps...on the lowest sensitivity.  Disappointing.  I wouldn't mind it being off by being under because I would exercising more and thats good.  But this way I feel like its cheating me at the cost of my health.  I will continue to use this unit but I will be on the lookout for a new unit.  I can not make a recomendation for this product.";Great price...Accuracy?  Not so much.
16;5.0;5.0;37.0;893;I bought this item about 3 months ago and LOVE it.  I saw some reviews where people complained that it counted steps when they weren't moving and didn't count steps when they were moving.  I had some of this trouble too and found that it was usually where I placed the pedometer.  You just have to experiment some to find the best place to put it for how you move (including how you move when you're sitting at your desk).\nI have tested it out several times to check for accuracy--counting my steps as well as those on my pedometer.  This may seem a bit manic, but I manually counted out more than 500 steps in a couple of these times.  In all cases, the pedometer was right on with my count (occasionally it was off by one or two steps only).;It's great!
17;11.0;1.0;31.0;958;I'm not sure just how accurate this pedometer is. I've been SITTING in front of my computer since I put it on and it reads 141 steps so far and I have it on the lowest sensitivity level.\nMore importantly, the tip of my right thumb is killing me from wrestling with the lid to get it open. The release button doesn't push in and release anything. You auctually have to use your thumb to pry it open.\nI will try using it tomorrow without closing the lid, but this seems to be a bit ridiculous.\nOh, It now reads 148 steps...;My aching thumb!!!
18;2.0;4.0;207.0;1025;"I'm recovering from back surgery and wanted a way to know--rather than guess--how close I come to meeting my daily walking goals. This comparatively inexpensive pedometer doesn't achieve perfection, but it does get the job done.\nOn the up side, it's small, easy to read and includes a user-controlled back light. The belt clip is extremely secure, and the screen displays everything from actual steps walked to total distance and calories burned. It was easy to adjust the stride length and body weight. My steps are tracked accurately with the ""sensitivity"" slider control set in the middle, rather than all the way to the left as many other reviewers suggest. I have learned that there is a bit of wiggle room on mine--if I count off 20 steps, it might say 19 on one set and 21 on the next. In the long run--I bothered to count all the way to 100 several times--it was spot on.\nOn the down side, the cover is extraordinarily difficult to open. Difficult as in I have wrestled with it for nearly five minutes just to pop it open. (I now don't close it quite securely. It doesn't fall open.) And I can see some folks might be bothered by the imprecision over short term counting. And for some reason, if I clip it to a pants pocket, rather than on a belt loop or my waist band, it doesn't seem to read anything at all. I have no clue why this is so, but it is a little disapointing.\nConsidering that every other pedometer I looked at was more than twice the price of this model, I'm astonished at how well it works. Perfectionists will likely prefer a more expensive version, but for short term use, casual interest, easy-going folks or even something to help get the kids more active, you can't go wrong.";Can't beat the price
19;15.0;5.0;24.0;1027;I loved this pedometer from the moment I opened the package.  It is not hard to program and it makes daily activity a lot more fun.  It has been accurate counting my steps after a bit of trial and error.  I bought this pedometer about 4 months ago and have since lost almost 20 pounds (20 more to go..).  It has been a great tool and I recommend it to everyone I talk to that is struggling with their weight.  Take it for what it's worth and you'll love it, too.;The best weight loss tool for a slacker.
20;28.0;1.0;9.0;1044;Having a pedometer is fantastic, and definitely inspired me to make sure I was more active.  However, this product is not up to snuff.  The first one I ordered was next to impossible to open, and returned to Amazon within a day.  The replacement I received worked fine, and then stopped working completely after 2 weeks.  I have decided to research pedometers and find a good working model that will work consistently for a reasonable amount of time.;It worked perfectely--for 2 weeks.  :-(
21;29.0;3.0;7.0;1053;I found the measurements to be pretty accurate but I have a lot of trouble opening and closing it.  I end up adding 10 steps just trying to get it open.  This is probably because the clasp is all plastic and there are some variaions in the plastic.  I hope that after using it a bit the clasp will loosen.;Good at measuring
22;30.0;5.0;6.0;1076;I really like this little gadget. I try to get ten thousand steps a day and it is very accurate. When I first got it I would walk around the halls counting my steps and then check and it would be exact or almost exact every time. I don't tend to worry much about the distance or calories but if I did they would be really accurate and useful too. It encourages me to walk more and I'm hoping that maybe I will lose a little weight by walking ten thousand or more a day. I definately recommend it.;It is really helpful!
23;1.0;4.0;267.0;1135;Here's what a pedometer should do for me:\n(1) Should be comfortable to wear all day\n(2) Shouldn't slide off my waistband so the clip needs to be flexible and firm (an extra safety leash is useful too)\n(3) Should be easy to read with a simple bend of the neck instead of removing the unit everytime\n(4) Should be secured in some way so that bumps or touches don't accidently set off buttons or reset the counter\n(5) Should be easy and intuitive to move between functions\n(6) Should be accurate in its count when you wear it correctly, and within 10% for distance when you set your average stride\n(7) Should have a few days of memory\n(8) Should be light  enough to be non-intrusive\nThis little doohickey from Oregon has all of the above, and I have found it to be fairly durable. It is light, secure because of the flappable cover, functional because the clip fits on a thick denim trouser waistband as well as a slim running track-suit lining, and at least in my case, it is also fairly accurate. Surely does not give me readings like 256 if I walk 10 paces, as another reviewer unfortunately experienced. There is a thing as a defective device, one can exchange it if he has a reasonable case, can't he?\nThe only other good alternatives to this device would be the offerings from Sportline or Omron. Sportline is sleek and I bought one because of its compelling price but the little sukker went kaput in 2 months. Omrons are known to have short battery lives.\nMy humble opinion -- for the price, Oregon's is quite a decent  purchase, at the very least I doubt you should face all the excruciating glitches outlined in other reviews here.;PERFECT? NO. BANG FOR ITS BUCK? ABSOLUTELY.
24;14.0;5.0;28.0;1190;"This is the best pedometer I have found at any price. The design does not allow for accidental reseting (very annoying).  The night light actually works well - a first in my experience with pedometers.  Setting the stride sensitivity was simple and maintains the setting well, I was concerned it might be jossled because it is a slide bar.  It has faired well through the inevitable dropping, sliding off the waistband and the occasional unsolicted game of ""cat hockey"".  I am thrilled to have a great pedometer, finally.";The Best
25;23.0;2.0;17.0;1221;The first one lasted a day, one day and when it fell out of my hand while I was passing it to someone to wear, it D-I-E-D.\nThe second one (totally great return policy Amazon!) was taken care of as if it were fragile crystal. It lasted 6 weeks before it also found it timely demise upon hitting the floor.\nI think the concept is remarkable, the tool itself is fabulous, it really does count steps with great accuracy, but it is not durable at all.  I am sadly disappointed.;Not Durable
26;4.0;5.0;44.0;1258;Ignore the review that says this pedometer adds steps whilst sitting on a table. If theirs did, it was faulty and should have been returned. Also, it has a sensitivity switch which should be set to low (all the way to the left). I've had mine for more than a year and it is the best pedometer I've ever had. We should all walk at least 10,000 steps a day to maintain fitness and this is an excellent way to monitor what you're doing.;Excellent gadget
27;17.0;5.0;25.0;1394;First, my walks around my village were boring, so I tried audio cassette books, which turned out super. Then I bought this little gadget and I can now calculate how many miles I have walked, how many calories I have expended, and how much progress I have made. It's very handy as it hooks onto your belt loop, and if you don't have a belt loop, you can hook it to your waistband, and so far it seems to be very accurate. I love it, and highly recommend it. It makes you competitive in a way, wanting to burn one more calorie than you did yesterday!;I really like this little gadget.
28;25.0;3.0;14.0;1440;"Product shows distance walked AND number of steps; time of day and time walked; and the number of calories burned. Although it is nice to have all the information, the product seems to have more information than is necessary. Also, it's not easy to set each item.";More complicated than I wanted
29;16.0;3.0;26.0;1505;I've used my pedometer for a couple of days now and overall I'm satisfied.  It seems to accurately measure distance, but it is overly generous measuring calories.  After walking 5 miles, it told me I had burned nearly 1000 calories!\nI only wish that were true.  The calorie counting should be more realistic.;Accurately Measures Distance.  Overly Generous With Calories

0;1.0;5.0;9.0;0;Don't let the discounted price fool you! This is a beautiful, high quality, thick spined hardback digipack and I'm sure the price is so low (especially for a 2 disc digi-pack) because Warner Brothers probably over-manufactured it for the 150th anniversary. Surprise! No one was flocking to the stores and online to buy a 3 hour long early 90s civil war film (including me). I bought this as a gift and when it arrived in the mail it was in excellent, factory sealed condition. My parents recently bought a high definition TV and my father is a huge fan of both this and Gods and Generals, so I thought it was time to upgrade from his double sided DVD! You can't find this at Walmart and it is over double the price on Best Buy's website. Digibooks typically don't have the same issues as steelbooks during shipping! Highly recommended.;Review of packaging and shipping condition
1;3.0;5.0;20.0;23;I have owned and watched FOUR different video versions of Gettysburg.\n\nThe first was the 12-inch laserdisc version that was surprisingly well made. It was the theater-length release, at 254 minutes, and for me, a Civil War buff, watching it was almost like a religious experience. (I had a similar epiphany when I watched the Ken Burns Civil War documentary some time before, now available as a DVD.)\n\nThe second was the directors cut boxed-set laserdisc, that came with a nice book about the movie and about the battle itself. This second version, 17 minutes longer than the previous release, extended some scenes and added a few new ones, at least one of which added some dramatic depth to the movie. While I believe that the early disc was audio encoded in basic Dolby Surround (I am stretching my memory here), the second was done in DTS, which is also how the original was presented in movie theaters.\n\nThe problem with this 271-minute boxed set was that the video and audio (the DTS audio technology notwithstanding) were both inferior to that of the earlier disc. The video was excessively dark and off color in some scenes and, worse, the audio lost much of its impact, particularly the sections that involved canon and musket salvos. The canon salvos lacked the low-end reach and even the sequences with musket fire seemed to be dynamically compressed. The team responsible for the reissue may have assumed that the sonic impact of the canons and muskets we had with the earlier disc would be too much for most TV speaker systems, or even outboard audio systems that had anemic subwoofers. They did not want set owners to rage about destroyed speakers.\n\nThe third release was a DVD, and it improved somewhat on the second laserdisc. However, even it seemed to lack the impact of the first disc. Worse, the length was dialed back to 254 minutes - an artistic blunder. The disc, being an early DVD, also had the program split between two sides, and in spite of the extra surface space the disc seemed to have some tracking problems with some players (both of mine, for example). I have read elsewhere that this was not unusual, and so I ended up ordering a fourth version from Amazon.\n\nThis one was a blu-ray item - and included a second disc that included three featurettes on the making of the movie, plus a booklet built into the disc holder that offered up some historical information, as well as information about the main actors. The movie disc itself has running commentary options by historians James McPherson and Craig Symonds. A nice, tidy item, this set.\n\nBest of all, this fourth version combined the best technical aspects of the previous ones into a terrific visual and DTS-audio package. Indeed, the canon and musket cacophonies were now more emphatic than ever. I have watched a lot of action movies over the years, and while the individual canon thuds were no more powerful than many other explosions I have experienced with various dynamic action movies on my AV system, the combined impact of dozens of thuds piled on in close succession was in a class by itself. I am convinced that many subwoofer systems (or woofers on AV rigs that do not use subwoofers) would be damaged beyond practical use if the volume were played loud enough for the dialog throughout the rest of the movie to be properly audible. Technically, this is a stupendous, demo-grade blu-ray disc that demands a serious audio playback rig.\n\nIt is also a stupendous story. The actors were very well chosen for their roles, with all of the principles doing standout work. There have been criticisms of Sheen as general Lee, but I do not agree. Perhaps someone like Jason Robards might have been better (Robards looked more like Lee than Sheen, which is what my southern-born wife thinks), but Robards was 70 at the time the movie was made and Lee was in his middle fifties, the same age as Sheen was when he played the part.\n\nAnyway, Sheen played Lee the way I see Lee. Some (major fans of Lee, we can be sure) have criticized how Sheen made Lee seem almost deluded when rationalizing the potential effectiveness of the charge on the third day. However, to my way of thinking Lee almost had to be deluded and over-optimistic about what his army could do. He had to be so to think that Picketts 15,000 men could traverse a mile of open space while under fire from every gun on the Union line within range. General Longstreet, as played by Tom Berenger, was the only fully rational and aware Confederate with authority involved during the battle. Longstreet wanted to have the army shift position to better ground and fight a defensive battle, but unfortunately he could not get Lee, who was looking for a fight, to make that move and did not have enough authority to veto the charge.\n\nRegarding that charge, the movie was done before the kind of CGI abilities we have these days, so the men involved with the movie version were real men - Civil War re-enactors who had the chance of a lifetime to do a large scale presentation. There were not as many as in the original charge (perhaps only a third as many), but judicious and skillful camera usage allowed for a scene that is unforgettable. Incidentally, Ted Turner, who helped finance the movie, had a small and brief part in the move that those with sharp eyes will spot pretty quickly. Documentarian Ken Burns also had a small, and equally brief part.\n\nAnyway, the movie is terrific. It probably would be a good idea for those not apprised of just what transpired during those three days to read an internet summary or two (or maybe even a book about the war in general) in order to get an idea of what was going on. The movie covers only parts of the overall encounter (even though those parts presented were manifestly important), and a bit of background should make the viewing more meaningful than ever. I also suggest that a viewing of the Ken Burns documentary on the whole war would be a rewarding experience.;Superb presentation of a superb movie
2;23.0;5.0;5.0;356;"Darn, I though I wrote a review for this movie long ago, but this is by far the best movie about the Civil War I've ever seen. Probably because my avocation is the history of modern warfare, and Ted Turner who worked like hell to get the US Government and National Park Service to let them film this masterpiece on the actual Gettysburg National Cemetery. But while Tom Berringer was great, the guy who I never expected to play Robert Edward Lee as the Confederate commander was by a performance turned in by Martin Sheen, who played the part of Lee as both brilliant and lucky, at least until the battle starts getting underway, when you know Lee's stubbornness has led him to realize as Gen. George Pickett makes his famous charge across almost two miles of open land rising up to seminary ridge, where the union had superiority on the high ground, and finally the rebs had lost so many men, Lee knew he had lost the most decisive battle of the war, and with it, the CSA. So I say this if you've never been a fan of war movies, remember.this is your history, and if Lincoln hadn't kept sending one telegram after another, looking for that ""go-to' general, and when it was all over, Lincoln scolded Gen. Meade for letting Lee's army escape across the Pontomac back to southern territory. If Meade had done what President Lincoln, who was so desperate to end the war wanted, he would have charged down from his high ground and killed as many of Lee's men, even the wounded, as possible, taken the souths artillery, and finally taken Gen. Lee and his senior generals as Prisoner, which would have ended the war, July 5, 1863. The last day of the battle and Picketts charge were on July 4, 1863.";Without a doubt, this movie was a work of love by the re-enactors and Ted Turner in making Gettysburg, and I thank them.
3;9.0;5.0;13.0;361;I really love this movie, it's one of my favorite civil war movies Martin Sheen and Tom Berenger portrays a great General Lee and General Longstreet and the rest of the actors and reinactors were also great!;I really love this movie
4;12.0;5.0;11.0;528;"This is one of the finest historical movies ever filmed in my opinion.  It was originally produced by Ted Turner as a miniseries for TV and as such it could not be considered for an Oscar ... which is a BIG shame because Jeff Daniels, who portrays the real-life Professor/Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, SHOULD have won an Oscar.  Others such as Stephen Lang, who portrays General George Pickett should also have won big as well as others in the cast.  The producers, actors, & Director all studied many accounts, written history & letters written by the actual soldiers and have made a film that is wonderfully free of typical Hollyweird BS which is often inserted in film productions for the sake of ""action"" or other garbage only to ramp up sales.  It was filmed on locations in or near Gettysburg or in other locations resembling the area as well as some parts of the actual battleground itself, thanks to the U.S. Parks Department.  They allowed the film crew & cast a few days to film in the Park itself.  The best example of this is the film's use of the hallowed ground where the legendary Pickett's Charge actually took place.  It can't get any more realistic than that!  This BluRay is the extended version & Director's cut and is definitely worth the price and well-worth watching for ANY Living History re-enactor, student, History Buff, or simply someone who likes movies based on real and/or Historical events.\nThe film is a screen adaptation of the book ""The Killer Angels"" by the late Michael Shaara which has been required reading at the U.S. Army war college for Army officers.\nI'd give this 6 stars if I could!";Outstanding !!!!!
5;21.0;1.0;8.0;664;"This is a case study for making a war film boring. The dialogue is wooden and the battle scenes look like Civil War buffs doing reenactments.  People praise the film for not being ""too graphic.""  But the reality of war looks and sounds much more like the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan than the sanitized battlefield scenes in this film.  It would be better to show people the reality of the Civil War, which was horrific.  By all means read Killer Angels, which provides a glimpse of what the actual battle was like.";Read the Book and Skip the Film
6;45.0;5.0;5.0;1222;"I saw Gettysburg for first time about 8 years ago on a rental DVD, bought it, and have watched it several times since then!!  I would say Gettysburg and Casablanca and High Noon are my 3 favorite movies!  I love history, and love to read about the Civil War,  I particularly have enjoyed reading several books on Ulysses Grant.(amazing figure, to come from working in his father's tanning shop, to becoming such a great general that Lincoln would say, ""I have a general!""  after the ones before had been rather duds!  I was pretty much blown away by this movie.  Jeff Daniels blew me away, from near the start when he talks to the mutineers, the movie had me.  The parts I was most moved by and just stunned by were when Richard Jordan (Gen. Armistead) talks to Tom Berenger (Gen Longstreet) about the possibility that he may face in some battle his good friend (from those days in California just before war broke out) union General Hancock, (Longstreet tells him Hancock is here at Gettysburg!)  unbelievable acting by Jordan, just stunning and so sad--he knows he will probably die and gives Longstreet some papers to give to Hancock's wife in case he, Armistead, dies.  Then Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain should have been given the Oscar!! (was he even nominated?)  His Battle of the Little Round Top is my next favorite part of the movie, probably close to 30 minutes long.  As another reviewer points out here (on 4/10/2000 ""A very good civil war movie"")  historians view  ""this small unit action""  (by the part of the 20th Maine)  to be one of the defining moments of history--I would think they probably mean world history, as I guess historians feel  if Little Round Top was lost, Gettysburg would have been lost, the South would have won the war, and American history would be very different--this great experiment in democracy failed!!!  Jeff Daniels is just stunning as he realizes there is nothing left to do (""if we stay here we can't fight --(they have run out of bullets) and we leave they will run over us and the whole hill will be lost "" (to paraphrase what he said) and thus the battle will be lost, the war will be lost, and the country will be lost.  So the only thing they can do is to take the desperate measure of drawing their sabers and charging.  It is just stunning to see the faces of his men as he is telling them this, his Major Ellis Spears asking , ""You mean charge?"" and the men are stunned, but Chamberlain says, ""Well, we'll have the advantage as we are going downhill.""  I just feel the whole Little  Round Top 30 minute sequence is some of the best movie making ever!!  The music, Jeff's talking to his men, the camera work and the music as he moves up and down his line of men.  When he yells, ""Bayonets!""  he looks absolutely crazed, I love that either the director or Jeff felt he should look crazed as he yells at the top of his lungs so all can hear him, I mean it is almost ludicrous how crazy he looks--his eyes bulge out-- when he yells ""Bayonets""  but I think it was neat that he did this, he is trying to yell as loud as he can, and at this point who wouldn't be crazed--you may die in a few seconds, your brother may die, and your dear friends and fellow soldiers may die!!!  And when Major Ellis yells charge and then Chamberlain yells charge and down the hill they go--into history--well, unbelievable movie making and gorgeous music!!  The last part I love, but no one here I think has commented about,  is the absolutely poignant 2 scenes with Gen Longstreet (Berenger) and his artillery commander, the 28 year old Col Porter Alexander played by the English/American actor James Patrick Stuart (who I see is in the TV show Supernatural--which I have never watched but am going to! to see his movie and TV credits just google him).  The first scene, Longstreet is talking to Alexander about making sure he fires enough artillery to clear the Union cannons off Cemetary Ridge before Pickett can move, and then a short while later, the 2nd scene is utterly poignant:  Alexander tells him that they had to move the remaining ammunition further to the rear so union cannons wouldn't destroy it, and Longstreet is frustrated as there are still too many union cannons firing; their conversation you might not get the first time, I didn't, because they are practically yelling at each other to be heard, it is noisy, but then watching it again, I listened better, and understood better what they were saying;  Longstreet ends by telling him (paraphrasing) ""Just keep firing, we have got to clear those cannons off that ridge!!""  They salute each other, and Alexander kind of lets his hand fall from his salute in a hesitant, defeated way, as Longstreet turns and leaves; and Alexander then takes off his hat in the most dejected, sad, and poignant manner you can imagine!  As he does this and turns and pauses with his hat on his chest for a second, it looks like a painting, young 28 year old Col Alexander is so handsome with his dark hair and beard and mustache, in his beautiful artillery commander long coat gray uniform with red accents (!!).  I was just blown away by this! What acting!!!  I have the 2000 issued DVD and the 2 scenes with Longstreet and Porter are on side B (yes the 4 hour plus DVD has 2 sides!)  and these Longstreet/Porter scenes  are scene #10 and the end of scene #16 (this is the sad, poignant one).  The Little Round Top segment is on side A, and runs from scene 28 -  scene 35 !!  Just want to say also, as someone else mentioned here, that 60's TV actor Andrew Prine is wonderful, so good as Confederate Gen. Garnett--practically zombie like, but I thought totally believable as he is about to take part in Picketts charge, and the way he acts and what he says, it is like, this is the day, it is inevitable that this could  be the day he will die!!  I thought of all the generals, north or south, he was the best of the actors who played the generals even though his was a very small part, he and Stephen Lang as Pickett, and of course Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain;  also very good as Chamberlain's younger brother Tom is C.Thomas Howell, so good looking and earnest--too bad Thomas Howell hasn't had a more prominent career as an actor.  He was wonderful!  And the ending of the movie is so poignant (yes, I use this word a lot but it seems appropriate for this movie about one of the most tragic periods in American history), at the very end as the smoke from the battle is still in the air in a beautiful sunset on the last day of the Gettysburg battle, Lawrence and Tom find each other, and look at each other in absolute sadness but also utter disbelief that they have both survived this battle, and then just embrace for a long time, and then look again at each other again, and then Tom's shoulders just go down just as the beautiful music just goes goes ""downward""  in a beat, just so touching and sad!!  I am just a crazed older woman who loves reading, reading about history and momentous events, and I just love this movie!!  Can you tell??!!  PLEASE SEE IT, HISTORY BUFFS,  AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK!!";Wonderful movie, this and Casablanca my favorite movies!
7;42.0;5.0;6.0;1396;I have owned this movie in about four different formats and both the standard and extended versions.  Yes, I am a Civil War person and while this is not good history, it is great entertainment to me.  They based this movie on The Killer Angles, one of the best Gettysburg novels.  The extras are experienced reenactors giving the movie an authentic look not found in most films.  The Producers made a serious attempt to make the actors look like the person they are playing, which is another nice touch.  All of this makes this the best looking, closest to history film on the battle.\nThe extended director's cut of 271 min adds over 20 minutes to the theatrical version.  Blu-ray extends the experience with a much sharper picture.  With this low price, it is worth upgrading to the best available system.;The one to own
8;19.0;1.0;14.0;1857;"I became a fan of Jeff Daniels after his depiction of Chamberlain of the Maine 20th on Little Round Top; those were the strongest scenes (and they better be!) But the rest - I fast-forwarded through an hour and a half of speeches. Who could write this stuff? Or believe that tough-as-nails soldiers from that era would even speak such sentimental drivel? It comes down to a poorly written screenplay focused way too much on myth instead of insight. You end up with a movie that tells instead of shows. Cinema is always better, to paraphrase a Steve McQueen adage, when actors use their their facial muscles more than their vocal cords. Actors know what to do - with proper lines. The raw material was there but the mine was never dug. Maybe the scale was too large for the crucial details to emerge, but if you're going to take on Gettysburg, you better bring it.\nI appreciate the volunteers' efforts, but many fill out their uniforms a bit much, an impossibility for the rebels after two years in the field fighting and evading the Union Army. Those guys should have been rangy sons of guns. A volunteer cast of thousands explains but does not excuse. At least some Confederates are shown marching shoeless.\nAnother detail: when Gettysburg's cannons fire they don't recoil backward. I noticed in Gods and Generals that the same director got around to correcting this. If there's no recoil (rifles included), then you're obviously firing blanks, a point I realize that's not appreciated by many, at least not consciously. If you're trying to create an impression of shooting to kill, then fool us into believing that something's coming out the barrel, especially with big guns.\nI have come to the conclusion that the predominantly positive reviews of the film reflect the political split in this country. Many people prefer idealized (and insulting to the men who died) depictions maintaining an iconography of American history, instead of gritty portrayals of flawed humans that inspire and vicariously inform. And when I say inform I don't mean through declarations and cueing string music.";Wished I'd missed.
9;48.0;5.0;6.0;1893;The following review only applies to my edition of the movie Gettysburg on Blu-ray (in comparison to my edition of the movie Gettysburg on DVD):\n\nThe Blu-ray definitely has a sharper image than the DVD. However, it also has a darker image. Thus some of the extras in the background--and even at times, a few of the faces of the actors in the foreground--that you would see on the DVD are little more than shadows on the Blu-ray. I thought about giving the Blu-ray only a 4-star rating for that reason. However, the darker image is far more realistic and dramatic.\n\nThe description on Amazon about the product does not specially say that the Blu-ray is an extended version. However, there are a number of scenes from the movie on the Blu-ray that were not on the DVD.\n\nThe description on Amazon says the Blu-ray is a 2-disc edition (as the DVD was). However, the Blu-ray is a 1-disc edition.\n\nThe photo of the Blu-ray displayed on Amazon shows a black case. However, the jewel case that came with my edition is the standard blue.

Thousands of passionate re-enactors help make this partial recreation of the pivotal Civil War battle a rousing experience for viewers. Points off for fakey-looking facial hair (Tom Berenger's beard is almost laughable) and some altering of facts for dramatic purposes, yet for feeling a part of a momentous clash of arms, this film tops them all.\n\nMartin Sheen portrays Confederate commander Robert E. Lee as philosophic, reverent, stubborn and devoted to his men, but with a volatile temper when crossed. (It is how I've always pictured him.)\n\nJeff Daniels not only looks like the 20th Maine's Col. Chamberlain, he is very convincing as a college professor of conviction who went off to war, ""because it was the right thing to do.""\n\nWatching Sam Elliott's emotive cavalry general John Buford, the first Union commander engaged, and against vastly superior numbers, is like wolfing down a second helping of very salty ham. He and his successful stand leave one thirsty.\n\nRichard Jordan's emotional displays as Confederate general ""Lo"" Armistead are all the more touching, as the actor knew he was dying and this would be his last film.\n\nStephen Lang delights as Gen. Pickett during a campfire argument over Charles Darwin and just who is ""descended from uh ape."" This playful banter makes so much more stark his bitter remorse after an open field ""Charge"" that Lee orders Pickett to attempt on Day 3 fails, and his division is decimated by Yankees safely entrenched behind Cemetery Hill's stone wall.\n\nWith the crippling of Gen. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia ultimately went the hopes of the South to prevail in a long, hard-fought war. The Confederacy's supply of men and armaments were nearly exhausted.

12;28.0;2.0;11.0;2074;"Many have commented on the historical accuracy of this film.  While the timing of these events themselves may be accurate, i.e., the first days fight, Little Round Top, and Longstreet's Assault (what most call ""Pickett's Charge), the accuracy of the actual battle sequences leaves much to be desired.  For example, in one scene, Lee is seen riding with several staff members and subordinates and says, ""To all commanders attack.""  This would have taken place during the very late morning or just after noon.  The next scene shows the death of Union General John Reynolds.  Reynolds was shot very early in the mornings fight, long before Rodes' division arrived on the field and the afternoon attacks occured.  Later, Tom Chamberlain is talking with some Confederate prisoners.  First the prisoner says he's from Tennessee, Archer's brigade.  He then says he was captured in the Railroad Cut.  Anyone with even a minimal knowledge of the battle knows it was Joe Davis's Mississippians who were engaged in the RR Cut, Archer's Tennesseans were on the south side of the Chambersberg Pike in McPherson's Woods fighting the Iron Brigade.  And one last inaccuracy I will point out (although there are many others) is Chamberlain and the 20th Maine.  Did they fight valiantly? Yes! Did they save the Union army?  Alone, definately NO!!  They had a large part, but much other valiant fighting occured on Little Round Top.  Also, the famous bayonet charge is way overblown.  Col. William Oates stated he was on the verge of pulling back after 3 hard charges up the hill.  The Alabamians were not making another charge up the hill when the 20th charged down the hill.  Chamberlain led the 20th gallantly, and was an important part of the defense, but other commanders knew how to ""refuse the line"" and order ""counter charges""; it was pretty basic tactics and any good colonel would have done the same.\n\nI enjoy the movie as a Civil War movie and love watching it for entertainment.  However, if it's historical accuracy you want, there are many excellent books out there to read.  For history read ""Gettysburg: The First Day""; ""Gettysburg: The Second Day""; ""Gettysburg: Culp's Hill and Cemetary Hill"", all by Harry Pfanz.  ""Picketts Charge"" by George Stewart is excellent and the reason Pfanz never bothered covering the subject.  And finally, the entire battle is covered very well in books by Stephen Sears and Noah Andre Trudeau.  For Little Round Top see, ""Stand Firm Ye Boys from Maine"" by Thomas Desjardin for the 20th Maines action, and/or ""Twilight at Little Round Top"" by Glenn W. LaFantasie for the entire action on Little Round Top.\n\nI am open to comments if I am wrong on these observations, but the extensive reading I've done and battlefield tours with Licensed Battlefield Guides (3 hours at Little Round Top) form the basis of observations.\n\nHarold Killinger";Historical Accuracy?

13;8.0;3.0;35.0;2140;I was looking forward to the Blu ray version of Gettysburg, already owning the DVD version. First, the pluses: beautiful 150th Civil War commemorative packaging and features (standard definition DVD) and the DTS Master Audio with low frequency bass channel (great for the cannon barrage)! Now for the spoiler - Picture quality! You would think that a premium priced Blu ray would deserve a pristine transfer, but no way. Yes, the picture is sharper and with more detail and vibrant colors, but the problem is gamma (dynamic range from light to dark). The picture is contrasty (no shadow detail-actors faces obscured under brims of hats) and murky in other parts. Who engineered this and authorized its release? I watched the same scenes from the DVD and the picture quality is far superior (except for fine detail and sound). Even though this entertaining historical epic has been expanded to 271 minutes, it still deserves better treatment. If this is released in the future, save your money until you can find a trusted review that covers picture quality in depth.;Gettysburg Blu ray - Pluses and Minuses!

15;20.0;5.0;15.0;2158;"As a child of the 1990s, I first encountered ""Gettysburg"" during one of its myriad screenings on the TNT cable network. I immediately connected with the film, a connection which has germinated into, if not obsession, certainly a keen interest in this period in our nation's history. Slavery, independence, invasion, politics, economics, brother against brother -- all ingredients for a potent and portentous conflict, and especially for great drama. I've also read Michael Shaara's great, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Angels/dp/034540727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Angels</a>&nbsp;from which this film was adapted, and it is certainly worth your time and makes an excellent companion to the film.\n\nThe film's strengths are its focus, length, and authenticity. By concentrating on a single conflict -- the pivotal battle at Gettysburg -- author Shaara and filmmaker Maxwell are able to delve into the psyche of their three leads, Confederate Generals Lee and Longstreet and Union Colonel Chamberlain, and paint an impression for the audience as to how and why these men were locked in such a long and bloody struggle. The level of character development is almost unheard of for a war epic, and a leisurely-yet-assured pace holds the viewer's attention for the duration of the film, which isn't the case with this film's companion prequel, ""Gods and Generals.""\n\nAs for this Blu-ray, I'm very pleased. The 271-minute extended cut of the film and commentary track is presented on the first Blu-ray disc while the documentaries, battlemaps, and trailer from the DVD release are housed on a second disc, also a DVD (and thus in standard definition). The digibook packaging is very attractive with vivid colors and the film's title is embossed; it's really quite striking. The 40-page booklet inside features cast and crew bios, as well as some commentary on the film and battle, along with a Civil War timeline. It's an excellent package.\n\nThe video presentation, while not reference quality, is quite good. Colors and fine detail are greatly improved over the DVD. There is significant film grain throughout, and, having never had the good fortune to view this in a theater, for the first time I really felt that the movie looked like a film. Watching this Blu-ray, you will wonder how you put up with that smeared DVD for so long. Audio is much the same; presented here in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, finally with a dedicated LFE channel for your subwoofer, so that cannonfire, gunshots, and Randy Edelman's stirring score all have far more oomph over previous incarnations.\n\nAll-in-all, if you own the DVD, this Blu-ray makes for an excellent and worthwhile upgrade. If you're new to the film, this is currently the best way to experience it. Very highly recommended.";Magnificent Epic Better than Ever on Blu-ray

As a 4+ hour movie, it's not something you just sit down and watch right away, but I have spent some time bouncing between the standard DVD and the Blu-ray version.  The Director's Cut does include some additional footage not seen in the originial release.  For example, the exchange between Longstreet and Harrison midway through the movie is expanded.\n\nThe transfer to Blu-ray is definitely an improvment over the original DVD transfer, but there is some obvious grain visible in most shots, and the contrast/clarity isn't comparable to more modern releases.  I did feel that the audio track was a bit cleaner and the explosions had a bit more punch.\n\nThe special features really aren't much different from what was previously available, and are supplied on a standard DVD.\n\nPeople who love this movie will enjoy this release, but it is not leaps and bounds better than the standard DVD release.;Finally in Blu-ray!
18;66.0;4.0;5.0;2162;"At 4 hours and 14 minutes, GETTYSBURG ranks as one of the longest U.S.-made theatrical releases ever. I wasn't surprised at all to discover that GETTYSBURG started out as a proposed TV miniseries. It has a distinct ""made-for-TV"" feel to it. However, unlike other miniseries, GETTYSBURG spares virtually no expense in portraying the pivotal 1863 battle in Pennsylvania that (together with Vicksburg, fought at the same time some 2000 miles away) changed the course of the Civil War.\n\nGETTYSBURG was based on Michael Shaara's outstanding Civil War novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Angels/dp/034540727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Angels</a>. Although GETTYSBURG was counted as a flop in its limited theatrical release, it has become a favorite in Home Video release, and a mainstay of schoolhouse lessons on the Civil War. Within its bounds, it is excellent.\n\nOne part of GETTYSBURG's excellence is the doing of Civil War buff Ted Turner who backed this project to the full, providing funds enough for meticulous detail. Another part of GETTYSBURG's excellence is provided by the hundreds of Civil War reenactors who populate the screen bringing their unpolished sincerity and love of history to the film. Yet another part of the film's excellence is provided by the National Park Service which allowed much of GETTYSBURG to be filmed on the battlefield itself. And yet again, the performances of the lead actors capture the sense of grandeur and tragedy that pervades the air at Gettysburg National Park to this day.\n\nOf particular note are the performances of Tom Berenger as General James Longstreet, CSA and Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain, USA. Chamberlain's valiant defense of Little Round Top on the second day of the battle denied Confederate forces the opportunity to flank Union lines and roll up General George Meade's army in a messy, bloody package.\n\nIn Berenger's and Daniel's performances it is crystal clear that both men, Longstreet and Chamberlain, profoundly feel the pathos of the war, that hideous sense of brothers fighting brothers, killing each other. Commanders on opposite sides were, or had been, personal friends, often roommates at West Point. The Union ranks included Southern soldiers from every State except South Carolina. The Confederate General Commanding, Robert E. Lee, had been offered command of the Union armies prior to the outset of war. The Civil War was nightmarish: Large bore, long range, low velocity late Nineteenth Century weapons technology met early Nineteenth Century Napoleonic field tactics that had men bunched in battle squares often face to face, making every battle a killing field; military medicine was all but nonexistent. Some 52,000 men died or were wounded in three days at Gettysburg, about half the total who fought. This almost matches the number of losses in Korea (53,000 in three years) and Vietnam (58,000 in ten years).\n\nDoes GETTYSBURG have weaknesses? A few. The theatrical beards worn by most of the men look too obvious (a minor point, but still noticeable). The onscreen battle is almost antiseptically free of gore (a legacy, no doubt, of the film's intended ""miniseries"" status) as opposed to the real battle, which was a charnel house personified. But by far it's biggest weakness is the casting of Martin Sheen (normally an excellent actor) as Robert E. Lee. In what is a small part, Sheen simply doesn't carry the role. He projects none of Lee's charisma and none of Lee's inborn elegance, so evident even in photographs, Sheen's Lee comes across as truculent and unassured. I've read that Sheen was cast as Lee only a day or two before production began, and that Sheen knew virtually nothing about Lee or the Civil War at that time; so perhaps his ""generic General"" is forgivable, or would be, were Robert E. Lee not such a central personage in Civil War history.\n\nAn engrossing film, GETTYSBURG needs to be seen by all Americans. It is, simply, our history.";"""But the cause for which we fought was higher; our thought wider...That thought was our power""---Joshua Chamberlain"
19;16.0;5.0;18.0;2226;"Unfortunately, Amazon explains little or nothing about the new Gettysburg Director's Cut blu-ray release. What exactly does `Director's Cut' mean here? These are the timings for the original theatrical release, the two previous digital releases, and the new blu-ray release, as listed at another site:\n\nGettysburg Original Theatrical Release - running time 3 hrs. 58 Minutes, plus a 20 Minute Intermission.\nGettysburg Laserdisc - running time 4 hrs., 29 min\nGettysburg DVD - running time 4 hrs., 14 minutes\nGettysburg Blu-Ray (2011 ""director's cut"") - running time 4 hrs., 31 minutes\n\nSince the 17 minute difference between the DVD and the upcoming blu-ray release is almost exactly the same as the difference with the laserdisc release, I can only assume that the added 17 minutes will be the same as that found on the laserdisc. This included one crucial scene that for some absurd reason was included in neither the theatrical release nor the DVD release. In it, following the first day's conflict, Lee meets with his generals who were responsible for leading the first day's battles and gets an admission from them that they failed to take the crucial Cemetery Hill if not the entire Missionary Ridge heights when they were supposedly open for the taking. Thus we come to know from this scene that generals like Early and Ewell were actually at Gettysburg along with Longstreet and Pickett, and that that was the reason why Lee ordered Pickett to charge the ridge on the third day. Also included in the laserdisc was a scene when Union cavalry general Buford enters Gettysburg on the first day before moving thru the town and engaging Lee's advance division west of town. He is met by several townspeople, including an officious mayor of the town who demands protection. To my recollection - I gave up my laserdisc version several years ago when my player self-destructed - this about takes up most if not all of the 17 additional minutes. The rest of the DVD release seemed to match the laserdisc release fully.\n\nLeaving aside the inaccuracies and omissions (some historians, for example, hold that Ewell probably couldn't have taken Cemetery Hill that first day whether he'd actually tried or not, since by late afternoon his advancing forces had become bogged down for a considerable time in chasing the Union forces through Gettysburg itself, and there was already at least a fresh division of Union troops on the summit facing the town; and a great deal of the 2nd day fighting, including General Sickles and the Wheatfield are completely neglected, while Meade hardly appears at all), the movie especially in its depiction of the Little Round Top battle on the 2nd day, along with the two-day argument that arose between Longstreet and Lee re the efficacy of continuing to fight the battle at Gettysburg, is highly vivid and accurate. Randy Edelman's music is also exceptional, while Jeff Daniel's depiction of Joshua Chamberlain, Stephen Lang's of Pickett and Tom Berenger's of Longstreet are especially outstanding. While casting Martin Sheen as the courtly Lee was controversial, I for one found his performance also excellent. The other great `stars' of the movie, of course, are the re-enactors, along with the battery of cannons that so vividly mark the prelude to Pickett's charge. In both DTS sound and blu-ray, the battle scenes especially should reach an ultimate level of excitement. Highly looked forward to!\n\n(Note: just a measure of what's happened to movie digital release prices in the past 25 years or so, I purchased the laserdisc version of the movie at $179.95 retail, in Orlando, Florida, sometime in the mid 1990's!)";What is the 'Director's Cut'?
20;67.0;5.0;6.0;3219;"Being an active professor, a war film collector, and a twenty-five-year military veteran, I sometimes tend to be overly-critical of war films, mostly in terms of historical accuracy and ""situational believability.""  The pains the producers took make this both an enjoyable film yet as historically accurate as they could are especially noteworthy.\n\nNumerous other reviewers have accomplished excellent detailed descriptions of the unfolding events that evolved into the Battle of Gettysburg, as described in the film, so I will limit my comments to those that I believe will focus on overall quality.\n\nThe film accurately presents the evolution of events that slowly build into one of history's most important battles, one that neither side really wanted to fight on this site, despite the fact that it proved to be ""good ground"" for such a massive engagement.  One aspect of this ""crescendo approach"" that I most appreciated was the presentation of many views of the characters and personalities of the military figures from both sides of the conflict.\n\nOne of the most important revelations was the fact that General Robert E. Lee was not the strategically infallible figure that many historians portray, and that certain decisions he made, despite the opposition of his excellent corps and division commanders, ultimately turned the battle in the Union's favor.  The film also subtly presented the effect on the battle's strategy and outcome of the untimely death of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, as presented in ""Gods and Generals.""\n\nWhen I first saw the listings on the cast of this film, I was taken aback, since I had mentally stereotyped some actors' in previous roles that would not seem to be a ""fit"" for their roles in this film.  However, Martin Sheen did a fine job as Robert E. Lee, Tom Berenger was superb as General Longstreet, Stephen Lang excelled as General Pickett, and so on.  The greatest surprise was the performance of Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose performance is followed here and further expanded upon in ""Gods and Generals,""  ""Gettysburg's"" prequel.  This film, and his performance in ""The Crossing"" clearly showed what a fine and versatile actor Daniels is.\n\nIt would be redundant to describe some of the most fantastic battle scenes ever filmed, as this has been well-covered by other reviewers.  ""Utterly fantastic"" about covers it, in terms of realism and a ""spare no expense"" attitude on the parts of the producers who desired historical accuracy in the making of the film.\n\nI seriously cannot imagine any collector who would not place this film near the top of most valued films of all time.  Simply priceless, especially in terms of emphasizing the always elusive ""human side"" of war films.";The Civil War film for the history student!
21;68.0;3.0;6.0;3272;"This movie is based on the book ""The Killer Angels"" which is an awesome work of art (Pulitzer Prize winning novel).  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading the book thoroughly before attempting to watch this movie.  The book is flat out phenomenal.  The movie, on the other hand, was disappointing for me.  I'll try to explain why I thought so.  First of all, the acting in this movie is not the best work done by the actors that appear in the movie, most of whom have impressive resumes.  The way Martin Sheen portrays Robert E. Lee makes one wonder how this General could have achieved such a lofty reputation.  I think Sheen was off base in his effort here.  Tom Berenger, however, plays a great General Longstreet.  The fake beards in the movie are terrible and hard to over-look as you're watching it and trying to follow this gripping story.  You almost can't stop yourself from laughing at the makeup.  The movie itself is very long, around 4 hours, and you have to flip the DVD over after viewing the first half, which in itself is not a problem, but I would think that the director could include more important scenes in a movie of that length than some of the scenes left in.  For example, I would have liked the movie to explore the interaction between Lee and Longstreet AFTER the battle (which the book does some).  This movie is hard to follow if you haven't read the book and already have an idea where the story is going.  The movie jumps around and it is easy for the first time viewer to get lost and not understand where the movie is going as it bounces around from one side of the battle to the other and from one character to another.  The movie makers didn't do a good enough job transitioning from scene to scene to keep the audience clued in to what was happening and why a particular chain of events was important to the story and the outcome. If you are a true civil war ""buff"" I definitely think you should watch the movie, but don't expect a masterpiece or a great piece of work.  Movies are NEVER as good as the books they are based upon.  It seems that the acting in this movie is ""wooden"" with the actors reading from pages of script, as if hurried along to get finished.  The way the scenes were shot gives the movie an ""artificial"" feel as if they are on a stage with a bunch of props and as a result the movie doesn't feel ""realistic"".  It seems as though you are watching a re-enactment instead of actual events (other war movies escape this trap and make the audience feel they are watching the actual event).  In summary, I'm glad I watched it but I thought it could have been better.  This movie is average at best.";Not as good as most of these reviews claim.
22;89.0;5.0;5.0;3330;A five star movie that is a tad diminished in the currently released editions due to lack of a complete and full release in DVD.\n\nThe 271-minute version is longer than this theatrical version of 254 minutes, which tends to be the one mostly encountered in DVD.  Moreoever, the more extensive Collector's edition, originally sold at a premium price as part of a kit of memorabilia, included the truly longest, most complete version of this great film on VHS (nearly 30 extra minutes), but has never been released on DVD. This version included extended and deleted scenes that were important to story and character development, especially Lee's decision to attack the Union Army despite disadvantageous situation, as well as Buford's defense leading up to Reynold's arrival.  The latter scene is instrumental in seeing the role of Reynolds and knowing more about him and the respect he commanded from his troops(not to mention some fine acting). These scenes should never have been cut. Many fans are anxiously awaiting a full release in DVD format that this truly great film warrants.;Please release extended Collector's version on DVD!!
23;61.0;2.0;7.0;3508;"The movie seemed historically accurate as told from the Union side. Unfortunately, the movie leaves out many important battlefield events--events like the ""battle of the wheatfield,"" or the fighting in the orchard. Much is left out. My main complaint was a lack of passion in this movie--a lack of emotion. The characters walk into the battle like toy soldiers, albeit colorful ones. They seem to take pride in a lack of emotion. On every level, this movie fails to show the stress of battle, the fear, the hatred, the horror or emotion of human beings shooting each other down by the hundreds like cattle on a smoky, choking, dusty, noisy, confused battlefield. Maybe I am missing the point, but I just could not feel this movie--it lacked emotion, and I probably would not watch it again.";Somewhat disappointing
24;50.0;5.0;8.0;3536;"This is a nice transfer of novel to screen.  Michael Shaara's work is well known to those interested in the Civil War.  It used an interesting technique--selecting several characters and reporting their observations of events and their perspectives and understanding of those.  Among the key characters from whose eyes we see things include: Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Winfield Scott Hancock, and--from the First Day--John Buford.  This is a long movie, over 4 hours.  But to encapsulate as sprawling a battle as Gettysburg, this is altogether appropriate.\n\nWhat of the cast?  Overall, awfully good for a movie that is far from a traditional theater release.  Martin Sheen plays Robert E. Lee (I'm not sure that he's as wooden as some reviewers comment, but his ""It's all in God's hands now"" does become a bit stale by the end); Jeff Daniels is quite affecting as Chamberlain (he has an appropriate academic air and portrays an amateur's sense of warfare); Sam Elliott as the hard-bitten, crusty Buford is almost perfectly cast; Tom Berenger does a nice job portraying Longstreet's discomfort with strategy and tactics and a foreboding of the battle's outcome.  Secondary characters are played well, too, such as Stephen Lang's George Picket, Richard Jordan's Lew Armistead, and Kevin Conway's Sergeant Kilrain.  All in all, the acting is quite well done.\n\nThe scope of the movie?  It begins with the hours before the meeting engagement at Gettysburg (this was an ""accidental"" battle with neither side anticipating a great fight there).  Among the scenes is a delightful meeting among Armistead, Pickett, and Longstreet in which a pleasantly diverting discussion of Charles Darwin takes place.\n\nThe first day featured the confrontation between Harry Heth's division and Buford's cavalry.  As the pressure begins to be too much, General John Reynolds, at the head of the fearsome fighter of the First Corps arrives.  At this point, the movie gets a but fuzzy historically.  One gets the sense that the line starts collapsing at one place as the Iron Brigade arrives at another, under the direct command of Reynolds.  This is misleading; the forces to the immediate north of the Iron Brigade did not collapse until after Reynolds' placement of the fighting Westerners and his death.  The day ends with a powerful meeting between Buford and the Union generals gathering at Gettysburg.\n\nOn the Second Day, the key action in the movie includes Devil's Den and Little Round Top.  On that day, much more happened, including desperate fighting on Cemetery Ridge and Culp's Hill, not depicted in this movie (but the movie is already long at 4 hours, so this is merely a minor quibble).  The DVD accepts pretty much without question Chamberlain's rather self-serving version of the 20th Maine's stalwart fight, protecting the left flank of the Union army.  Nonetheless, this is a powerful scene and works most nicely.\n\nThe Third Day?  The focus is Pickett's Charge (technically a misnomer, since other divisions were involved as well (Pettigrew and Trimble commanded troops as well).  The tension of the day is well portrayed.  E. Porter Alexander directed a massive cannonade to try to wreak havoc on the Union Center.  At the close of the barrage, the 12,000-15,000 Confederate troops are shown beginning their doomed charge.  The music swells in a most affecting scene.  And then the carnage begins, with Union artillery and later rifled musket fire decimating the attackers.\n\nMuch poignancy in this third day.  The personal courage of Hancock (which appears to be historically accurate), the brave last stand by Armistead (also correct), the effort by Lee to inspire his troops after the repulse, and so on.\n\nThere are some historical glitches here.  The movie misses many dramatic moments (although how could it be otherwise with the time limitations of a movie format?).  On the whole, however, this is a powerful version of the critical battle at Gettysburg.  Well worth watching.";The novel comes to life
25;18.0;3.0;21.0;3577;This film was Ted Turner's baby.  He wanted to produce a movie that re-enacted the bloddiest battle on American soil.  When it was completed, the film was over 4 hours long.  Much too long for theatrical release.  So he premiered it on his cable network, TNT in 1993.  The battle scenes itself are worth the long run time.  It's not too graphic and works as a historical referrence.  That may be it's downfall, as well.  Another is the long stretches of dialogue.  Though needed for continuity, after a while, the film started to suffer from overindulgence.  If you can endure it's length, you might find this film rather entertaining.  Give it a try!;An Long, but Intriguing Epic!
26;62.0;5.0;7.0;3603;Gettysburg is a great movie that was inspired by one of the most decisive battles during the Civil War. Ronald Maxwell, the director, hired a historain, James McPherson so help him in making sure the battle scenes were as true as they actually happened in 1863. Gettysburg has three days of fighting along with events that led up to the war making it very gory and action-packed. There is alot of death in this movie but since Gettysburg was one of the bloodiest battles with 50,000 American casualties, the amount of death in the movie is appropriate.\n\nThe first day of fighting consists of Buford trying to maintain his position in Gettysburg to make sure that the Union army has the best land position. The second day of fighting is centrally located at Cemetery Hill, Little Round Top, and Culp's Hill. The third and final day at Gettysburg consisted of one of the most famous battles at Gettysburg: Pickett's Charge. This is the day that Lee realizes that he has to retreat due to too many Confederate losses.\n\nThis movie is, historically, very correct. The locations of the battles are historicall accurate along with the general's names. Mostly everything in this movie was, in McPherson's eyes, historically accurate. One can learn alot about the Civil War by watching this movie because it shows how the soldiers felt and lived and the effects of war on them. It also talks about past and upcoming issues in the war. This was a great historical movie but also very entertaining and i would recommend it to anybody that was interested, or wants to become knowledgable about the Civil War.;Gettysburg
27;39.0;5.0;10.0;3658;"Turner Pictures' ""Gettysburg"" is the lengthy but fascinating dramatization of Michael Shaara's classic Civil War novel ""The Killer Angels.""  At mini-series length and populated with an army's worth of solid actors, ""Gettysburg"" delivers the gripping story of the three-day battle as experienced by some of the key personalities.\n\nAmong the highpoints:\n\nSam Elliot as hardbitten Union Cavalry General John Buford, who recognized the value of the terrain at Gettysburg and whose decision to stand there helps bring on the battle.\n\nJeff Daniels is absolutely superb as Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, a professor at Bowdoin College become a leader of men at war.  Jeff Daniels manages to capture both the intelligence and the determination that won Chamberlain a Medal of Honor in the desperate struggle for the end of the Union line at Little Round Top.\n\nTom Berenger gives a nuanced and conflicted performance as Confederate General Longstreet, Lee's most reliable Corps Commander, who advises Lee against the Battle at Gettysburg and who must overcome his better instincts to execute Lee's orders.\n\nMartin Sheen does his best to deliver as Confederate General Robert E. Lee, but only just fails to capture the charisma and the hidden steel that made Lee such a deadly and successful battlefield commander for so long.  Perhaps the best of his performance  in this movie is his meeting with his missing cavalry commander, J.E.B. Stuart, after the second day of battle.\n\nThe movie was filmed over the actual ground at Gettysburg using properly equipped re-enactors who add much authenticity to the battle scenes.  The sharp-eyed viewer will enjoy picking out a number of actors hiding behind more or less authentic period whiskers.  The magnificent score adds to the appreciation of what was at stake at Gettysburg, while the prologue and epilogue provide a haunting sense of the harsh fates awaiting many of the key players in the battle.\n\nThis movie is most highly recommended to fans of the Civil War who are prepared to overlook some TV-movie production shortfalls for an entertaining and educational dramatization of the Civil War's most fateful battle.";For Civil War Enthusiasts...

30;63.0;5.0;7.0;3903;This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle.  I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.\n\nThousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.

31;91.0;4.0;5.0;3930;"Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.\n\nI understand that to get a film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast.  But an unknown who looks more like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better choice.  And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting.  Jeff Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping.  Instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of  the NE accent (think of Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief.  But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders in an Ed Wood production.\n\nI think the story works because there's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable.  The battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of forbearance.  If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction, as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator.  It falls a bit short of that, however.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery.  They fought to preserve the Union, which is a very different concept.  Abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the sole cause of the war.  The movie dumbs this down a bit, making the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.\n\nThe battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers should remember that it did not end the Civil War.  The north absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg.  C. Thomas Howell will continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie.\n\nStill and all, the film is very watchable.  And due credit should be given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film.";Flawed, but effective

You'll see rows of cannons shooting.  That's real.  Did you know those cannons shot down the radio controlled helicopter that was used to carry camera equipment?  It was the third film take of the Confederate cannon barrage for Picket's charge.  The day was hot, long, and filming was not going well.  The helicopter flew down the line taking pictures of the cannons going off.  Instead of flying to the end of the cannons the controller put the helicopter right in front of the cannon muzzle as it went off.  The blast knocked the helicopter out of the sky.  So, in 1992 a Confederate cannon crew shot down a helicopter.\n\nFacts, this movie is fairly accurate.  It's not perfect.  They could not show the fighting on Cememtary Hill nor the skirmishing on the forth day.  However, it's accurate and most of us extras spent nearly $1000 ('92 dollars) on getting the correct clothing and equipment.\n\nThe one fact that you'll like in this movie is it shows the desperate fighting on Little Round Top.  Yep, the only thing that saved this republic was a Union colonel who used to be a school teacher and his little regiment of Maine Infantry.  Did you know that the US Army considers this ""small unit action"" to be one of the defining moments in history?  I will not give away how it goes.  However, Jeff Daniels is in his prime and does a fantastic job of capturing the mood of the moment.\n\nI did not like Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee.  That costs a star.\n\nThe rest of the movie is pretty good.  Now, this movie isn't as good as the movie that defined the type: Glory.  Glory is a rare five star movie and it will go down as a classic of the age.  However, this movie is far better than the prequel, ""God's and Generals"".  You can get this movie for $6 on discount and you'll watch it every once in a while.  I would use this movie for school instruction on Civil War history.  Historically it's fairly accurate.  It only has a PG-13 rating.  If you used ""Glory"" some people may get upset over the very strong words in that movie.\n\nI got this movie on discount.  If you look for a flying fence post at Picket's charge you'll see me, a small ""reb"" who is sprinting by the fence.\n\nHelp me justify my past excesses to my wife.

35;77.0;5.0;6.0;4065;This is obviously one of the best Civil War films ever made, with only Glory rivaling it.  Ronald Maxwell relied a great deal on Joshua Chamberlain's memoirs, and some people have a problem with that.  However, for the most part, the film is historically accurate and gives one an understanding of the feeling of battle.  Longstreet's ambivalence even comes across quite clearly.  At the same time, Maxwell does not lose sight of the fact that this is a dramatic movie, meaning to entertain as well as educate.  (This is something that Maxwell forgot when he directed the mediocre Gods and Generals.)  The DVD itself has a couple of nice extras.  A great bargain for the price.  This film deserves a two-disc presentation.;VASTLY SUPERIOR TO GODS AND GENERALS!
36;64.0;5.0;7.0;4070;Gettysburg is an excellent film. It is well acted, with excellent cinematography and outstanding realistic pacing. I won't get in-depth with the story, as that has already been done, but here are a few things any prospective viewer may want to know....\n  First, the source material. The movie is based on the award winning (and EXCELLENT) book, The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara (incidentally, his son Jeff has been writing war novels to follow in his dad's footsteps for years now). The movie follows the novel closely, and for historically nitpickers, that isn't always a good thing. The most glaring example is the usage of Joshua Chamberlain as the 'unsung' hero of Gettysburg. As any true student of the Civil War should know, the events involving Chamberlain on Little Round Top in the book and the film are BASED ON CHAMBERLAIN'S OWN VERSION OF THE EVENTS. Chamberlain was a NOTORIOUS self-promoter after the war, and not a SINGLE man in his old command backed up his version of events. Quite a few outright disputed Chamberlain's version. For example, some insisted that Chamberlain's brilliant bayonett charge NEVER HAPPENED. Not that the charge didn't happen- just that Chamberlain had nothing to do with it. They stated that the charge happened spontaniously (a common occurence in the warfare of that era), and was NOT the result of any plan or order from Chamberlain. Chamberlain simply saw an opportunity to grab glory for himself by claiming credit for the charge. Any in-depth investigation into the man will reveal his true personal character was hardly the shining hero atop Little Round Top that he wished to convey. Taking personal credit for the spontanious actions of an entire regiment is not even ethical, much less heroic. Michael Shaara apparently bought Chamberlain's version of events hook, line, and sinker. Sadly, Shaara's book had such an impact on the public consciousness that many believe that the version of Chamberlain depicted in the book is based on real historical fact, when really it is at best EXTREMELY dubious storytelling. Having said that, Shaara's book is still very close to the actual events that happened. There is a little creative license to create drama, but for the most part it accurated depicts what happened during those three July days of 1863.\n  One other minor grievance I had with the film was the battle scenes. While very authentic looking, the scenes still suffered from something that most war films suffer from: a lack of combatants! The assault on Little Round Top on the second day involved MANY thousands of confederate soldiers, yet the scenes of this assault only show about 20-30 rebels at any one time. Even a skirmish would involve more men assaulting the 20th Maine than that! Obviously, the budget constraints and shortage of reenactors are to blame, and so can be forgiven. Just be aware that ALL the assaults were MUCH grander in scope than what you are seeing onscreen, including the third day's charge (incorrectly labelled Pickett's Charge by history).\n  Of course, both of these grievances are very minor points, and do not subtract from the power and drama of the film (notice I still gave it 5 stars!). The cast has a lot to do with why this movie is so powerful: an excellent job is done by virtually the whole cast, with Jeff Daniels standing out in particular (ironically enough, Daniels portrays Joshua Chamberlain). Daniels' scene when he learns of a comrade's death is the most poignant in the entire movie, and reminds us that the 'glory' of battle comes with a terrible price indeed. On a slightly more sour note, C. Thomas Howell does a barely adequate job. A better actor should have been chosen to portray Chamberlain's younger brother Tom, and thank god Ted Turner only has a cameo, his acting is ATROCIOUS.\n  The location scenery is both historically accurate (or close enough) and beautifully utilized, and the battle choregraphy is quite good, considering the limited budget and largely volunteer cast of extras.\n  Overall, Gettysburg is the absolute BEST Civil War movie ever made. It is very powerful, and if you you have any interest in one of the most important events in America's history, I encourage you to watch this movie. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECCOMENDATION!\n  As a side note, a follow up movie, Gods & Generals, was made. Sadly, it does not live up to the expectations set by Gettysburg. Feel free to check out my review of Gods & Generals.;The BEST Civil War movie ever made, even though its not perfect...
37;24.0;3.0;17.0;4179;"Gettysburg is a film that is really not meant for consumption by the general public.  The length of the movie alone is over 4 hours.  When I went to go see this movie in the theaters, there actually was an intermission.  There are two ways to approach a critique of this movie.  One is as a historical interpretation.  The movie is based on the book ""The Killer Angels"", and the book is very accurate in the course and scope of the battle.  For Civil War buffs, the book and movie are slanted towards Longstreets' recollection of the battle.  In that vein, the movie fits in nicely into the historiography of modern Civil War studies.  As a movie, the scope and cinematography have a very grand vision.  Some...repeat some...of the acting could be construed as overdoing it and Longstreet's beard looks like it was ordered from ""Beard Club For Men.""  Those are minor points however, and once the viewer gets past those parts, the main characters can more then hold their own.  For a Civil War buff, like myself, the movie never felt like it was slowly paced.  (Unlike the prequel ""Gods and Generals"" which was probably the most slowly paced movie in cinematic history.)  Martin Sheen has taken criticism for his portrayal of Lee, but I tend to believe that he was excellent as the patriarchal, beloved and aging Southern general.  From the viewpoint of the historian, Lee, in 1863 was convinced of his own invincibility and Sheen's acting brings this home.  Jeff Daniels, one of the most flexible actors of our generation, plays the sometimes aloof ex-professor Chamberlein with ease.  Overall, Gettysburg is just one interpretation of this momentous battle, with excellent acting on both sides.";Interesting Interpretation
38;17.0;1.0;24.0;4238;Anyone, and I mean anyone, who has read much about Robert E Lee can see that the selection of Martin Sheen to portray Lee, and Sheen's inability to capture how most historians have described Lee are failures.  I also found that side of the movie dedicated to unstanding battlefield strategy and tactics was extremely poor.  There was an attempt to portray the poor intelligence both sides had to deal with, but I found the screen play was inferior in its treatment of what was happening all over the battlefield.  I give the film one star, and feel I'm being generous in doing so.\n\nAC Falk\n\nAiken, SC;Gettysburg - M Sheen's failure with Robt E Lee
39;47.0;5.0;9.0;4240;"Based on late author Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War novel THE KILLER ANGELS, GETTYSBURG brings the bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil to life on the screen in one of the most moving, epic films ever made. The movie covers the brutal three-day conflict fought at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from July 1st through July 3rd, 1863 mainly through the experiences of three incredible men: Confederate General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen), Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), and Union Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels). Through these men and others, GETTYSBURG tells the story of this decisive engagement of the Civil War perfectly.\n\nThe whole cast's performances are stellar throughout the entire movie. Jeff Daniels' portrayal of the professor-turned-soldier Colonel Chamberlain stands out as one of the best performances in the film, along with Tom Berenger's excellent General Longstreet. And though Martin Sheen may not completely capture the physical characteristics of General Lee, he certainly captures his spirit. The minor roles are also incredibly well done, from Stephen Lang's Confederate General George Pickett to Kevin Conway's Union Sergeant ""Buster"" Kilrain. Each actor's similarities and historical accuracy-minded devotion to his character gives the film an incredible authenticity.\n\nOne of the many things that sets GETTYSBURG apart from so many other war movies is its amazing attention to historical accuracy. Not only was the movie filmed entirely on the actual battlefield locations in Pennsylvania, but the film also benefits hugely from how historically correct the uniforms, weapons, and sets are. Its use of over 4,000 Civil War reenactors makes its epic battles far more realistic, powerful, and moving than any movie could ever accomplish using computerization.\n\nEvery one of the battle scenes is astoundingly well-done and realistic. From Union General John Buford's first encounter with Rebel infantry to Colonel Chamberlain's courageous stand atop Little Round Top to the massive, climactic, heavy-with-emotion Pickett's Charge, each battle tells its own story, develops characters, and flows with energy and heroism.\n\nThe soundtrack to the movie is a glorious musical accomplishment. Composed by Randy Edelman, its combination of epic battle themes and classical Civil War-era music not only conveys the feel and emotion of the film perfectly, but also stands alone as the best soundtrack ever composed for a war movie.\n\nWith its spectacular cast, wonderful script, glorious soundtrack, epic battle sequences, constant devotion to historical accuracy, and more, GETTYSBURG delivers an unrepeatable, awe-inspiring portrayal of the courageous men of the Union and the Confederacy who fought in the Civil War.";The Best Civil War Movie Ever Made
40;79.0;5.0;6.0;4326;This is probably my favorite film of all time, as it smacks of heroism on both sides.  Maxwell did such an outstanding job of representing both sides well.\n\nHowever, several years ago, a Director's Cut came out on VHS, with scenes that NEVER should have been cut, and I would love to see this on DVD.;Outstanding film, but wish this were the Director's Cut.
41;80.0;5.0;6.0;4329;"What can I add that the other reviewers didn't say?  I have\n\nwatched this film numerous times and I never get tired of it.\n\nThe scene where Col Chamberlain leads the 20th Maine in the bayonet charge at Little Round Top literally brings tears to my eyes-such valour, such courage!  A Union officer once said that Pickett's Charge was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.  This film allows us to see it ourselves (of course we can never feel the dread and excitement the Union troops felt as they saw the Confederate line approaching!)\n\nWhile there are many fine performances, I find Tom Berringer as General Longstreet the most engaging.  Here is a man who was at best ambivalent about the whole war (he tells the British observer that the South should have freed the slaves before they fired on Ft Sumter) and strongly opposed to the attack at Gettysburg, yet his strong sense of duty and loyalty to General Lee prodded him on to planning and carrying out an attack that he knew would be a disaster.  Similarly, it is known that Robert E Lee himself was not enthusiastic about slavery or succession, yet he states that he could not fight against his native Virginia.  We, today, can not relate to the motivations and loyalties that drove these men.  Lee has been considered, at least in the South, a saintly figure and they show the love his men had for him, yet the film portrays him as a complex figure.  He states that he ""enjoys"" the war (he once said ""it is good that war is so horrible lest we grow too fond of it"") and he thinks nothing of sending thousands of his men to their deaths, but we also see him deeply affected by the casualties.  We also see his overconfidence which blinds him to the true nature of the situation he finds himself in.  Some officers who fail him he treats gently (those who failed to capture the two Round Tops), but JEB Stuart he chews out for disappearing at a crucial moment (Stuart says there ""were reasons"" for his absence but they are not explained in the film).\n\nOne minor defect of the film is that the Union commander General Meade is barely seen and so we really don't get an idea of how Lee's Union counterpart played his hand. It is known that President Lincoln was very unhappy that Meade didn't pursue Lee and attempt to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia during its retreat back to the Potomac River. It would have been interesting to show how Meade justified his lack of action (he probably felt the army was too exhausted and feared a Lee counter-attack).\n\nIn short, this film, in addition to ""A Bridge Too Far"" are the finest large-scale battle films ever produced.";Just About Perfect
42;49.0;4.0;9.0;4456;I really enjoy this movie.  The depiction of how the battle evolved, and how Lee's overconfidence doomed his invasion was quite an accomplishment.  Pickett's charge was especially moving.  I thought Berenger did a great job of playing the role of General Longstreet and many of the other parts were performed admirably.\n\nOne gripe I have is the beards.  Some of them were so phoney looking I couldn't help myself from laughing.  If they were to do it over again, they would need either a new make-up artist or make the actors grow a beard for the movie.\n\nAnother thing I really like about the movie is the score.  Truly moving music to accompany a military drama that shaped the course of events in our country.;Excellent movie despite the beards
43;85.0;4.0;6.0;4469;"""Gettysburg"" is an almost direct adaptation of ""Killer Angels"" which works because ""Killer Angels"" was an excellent book.  The general public will find the length and detail a bit too much, but anyone interested in the Civil War will find this an excellent recreation of the turning point in the war.\n\nI teach high school US History, but I can only use parts of the movie for my classes because the kids start to glaze over by the third hour, but since the movie is filmed on location and so detailed I just use selected scenes to help explain the war and how it was fought.  Keeping track of who's who can be difficult for people unfamiliar with the Civil War - the book had descriptions of the main characters at the beginning so readers could keep track of the main characters, but obviously the movie could not really do this.";Excellent detail and authenticity - maybe too long
44;86.0;5.0;6.0;4472;I have seen this movie over 100 times, and I'm still moved by it. Though the movie has some historical inaccuracies, no film out there comes as close to portraying true history as this one, especially about the Civil War. For the most part, the acting was superb, especially by Jeff Daniels. The portion of the film when Armistead speaks about his past friendship with Hancock is the most finely acted scene of any movie I have ever seen. No prequal or sequal can add to this movie, especially if they're produced and acted as poorly as Gods and Generals.;Best Example of History on Film!
45;87.0;4.0;6.0;4476;"I read Shaara's novel ""Killer Angels"" and viewed the dvd after completing the book.  The movie faithfully transfers Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning book to the screen.  The acting is suberb, especially the performance of Jeff Daniels as Lawrence Chamberlain.  Martin Sheen gives a riviting perforance as Robert E. Lee, although Sheen's height in the saddle works against him at times (it is said Robert E. Lee had a long torso which gave him the appearance of being much taller on horseback, Sheen is often the shortest person in certain scenes). The epic battle scenes are often just a backdrop to the drama created between the characters in this film.  Even if you are not a ""war"" movie buff per se, this is a must see movie for any American.  Yes it is long, but this allows it to be true to Shaara's vision.  Yes there are some scenes that are overly mellow dramatic, yes the use of the terms ""good ground"" or ""high ground"" become annoying at times and yes several of the beards look like the glue is coming loose (I had to slip those in), but the above instances do not detract from the power of this film.\n\nOne of the few movies that made me cry (I'm not afraid to admit it) in quite awhile.";"Must See If You've Read ""Killer Angels"""
46;94.0;4.0;5.0;4484;"Gettysburg is an excellent movie revolving around the Civil War battle of Gettysburg.  I felt this movie was unique in the fact it showed the strategy and the logistics of the battle rather than showing the blood, horror, and dismemberment that I would expect from a movie based on the bloodiest battle of the civil war.  The movie starts on June 30, 1863, the day before the battle at Gettysburg begins.  The movie mainly revolves around the involvement of two groups, the 20th Maine Regiment (commanded by Col. Chamberlain played by Jeff Daniels) and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (commanded by Gen. Lee played by Martin Sheen).\n\nThe movie does show its share of blood; however, I thought the movie did a brilliant job depicting the logistics of the battle and what happened behind the scenes of the battle.  The movie showed the people behind the war, not just the war itself.  For instance, the movie portrayed some of the reasons Gen. Lee led the Confederate Army to battle at this particular place and the reservations some of the Generals under Gen. Lee had with fighting the North at Gettysburg.  It also showed Col. Chamberlain dealing with problems unrelated to the battle, such as taking in over 100 Northern soldiers who refused to fight after their unit was disbanded.  I do not know enough about the history of the Battle of Gettysburg to say whether the contents of this movie is factual or not.\n\nAt over 4 hours, this movie is slightly on the slow side.  If your idea of a great war movie is Hamburger Hill or Rambo, this movie is definitely not for you.  If you are interested in the people behind war and the decisions they make, this movie is definitely worth watching.";Excellent movie on the intricacies of war
47;40.0;2.0;11.0;4514;"After a hard session of exams, I wanted to grab a film that would pull my thoughts away from the long hours of study. I came across this one and thought ""great, a history film !"" So, there I was embarked for over four hours of interesting war stories, or so I hoped. At the end, I ask myself how I could hold on and see it in one straight session. In fact, I concur with several reviewers who qualify it as an unconvincing film.\n\nThe actors (and some of them are good, confirmed actors) are extremely ""theatrical"" at times, extremely ""soulless"" at others.  They spend too much time talking in an unconvincing way about philosophical issues or collateral matters that don't bring anything constructive into the story or the film. The result is that the film never really ""takes off"". I don't know if this is a problem with the script, the direction, or if the ambitious project of recreating a historical battle just overwhelmed almost everybody in this project. The fact remains that, in my humble opinion, the only one that really keeps his head above water is Tom Berenger. Also, some actors just pop into the film out of the blue for no apparent reason (for instance that general from the confederates who visits Lee before the great battle to be severely criticized by his commander in chief for not following orders, and we never hear from him again), others, such as Sam Elliot, just disappear after starring in the first part of the film and we don't really know why and what happened to him either. Also very ""light"" is the role of that officer from her gracious majesty. I can understand the director is trying to show that the British were interested in seeing how the war would go and maybe helping the confederates, but I would have liked to see this treated in a more serious way instead of spending film showing an idiotic tourist in the middle of what remains a major event in American history. I was equally very disappointed by the actor playing Jeff Daniel's brother in this film. He was great in ""soul man"" (comedy of the mid eighties), but this was not a film for him. He gave me the impression from one end of the film to the other to try to find how to fit in. As for the battles, most of the shots cannot hide the lack of talent of the participating soldiers (reason : they are not actors but just ordinary citizen that re-enact the battle every year). The special effects are far below minimum (we miss Sam Peckinpah here) and quite repetitive, and most of the fake beards really look fake... adding to the lack of credibility of the overall final result.\n\nOther major flaws are for instance the role of one of the Union's generals wife in this story. One of the Confederate generals gives Tom Berenger an item asking him to give it to that lady if he dies. We don't know why he does it, what relationship they had, and as a matter of fact we do not know until the very end of the film that it was a sample of the bible. So ? We also have the impression that Lee was an undecided leader (he first says he is going to reprimand a general of his for disobeying, then he congratulates him; he calls another to reprimand him and make him feel totally miserable but then refuses the resignation, and so on), wanting to emulate Napoleon, erroneously stubborn (none of the generals thought for a second they would succeed in their final assault), which is totally opposite to what I had read up to now in history books. Which is the good version ?\n\nThe best part of the film is the extra comments, which are also long, but very instructive. I enjoyed much more that part than the film itself. However, if you want a really good war related film, I would suggest you look for something else (Spartacus, The Battle of England, the Bridge on the river Kwai, Paths of glory,  the great escape, Saving Private Ryan, Sand Pebbles, Das Boot...). The list is really too long. That too puts ""Gettysburg"" at its place, down the ladder, regardless of the passion it may create because of the importance of the event for America and Americans.";Unconvincing and unnecessarily long.
48;59.0;5.0;8.0;4524;"This is one movie that I keep coming back to again and again.  Yes, I'm a history buff, and the Civil War is fasinating to me.  But, that is not the reason that this movie is so powerful.  What is powerful about it are the powerful examples of leadership.  A couple of examples stand out. At the end of side one, the ""Battle of Little Round Top"" is highlighted.  At the end of the approximately 30 minute excerpt, the leader, Colonel Chamberlain is confronted with a problem.  His men have run out of ammunition.  However, if he retreats, since he is on the flank, the Confederates will ""go over the hill, hit our units from the rear and our whole flank will cave in...""  What does he do?  Then, someone exclaims: ""Here they come again!""  So, he says ""We'll fix bayonets"".  His subordinate says: ""What do you mean - charge?""  And, Chamberlain takes charge, telling his men that they can do it because ""the Rebs must be tired... and we have the benefit of going down hill..."".  Well, they charged and won... Another scene also highlights leadership with a different result.  On the second side, one of the focus is on General Armistead.  When it is clear that Picket's charge has failed, he places his hat on his sword, and tells his men, ""follow me"".  To one soldier, who is rightfully scared, he says ""what will think about yourself in the morning"".  All this is done, knowing he will fail and with the premonition that he expresses in the previous day that he will die. Examples of personal leadership, examples of personal courage.  These are real stories and stirring every time that I see them.  And, this movie does the best job of communicating these personal stories.  This is truly my favorite movie, and I highly recommend it on many levels.";Powerful Movie
49;51.0;2.0;9.0;4526;Gettysburg is a mediocre reproduction of Michael Schaara's historical novel the Killer Angels. There are some parts of Gettysburg that are quite good, such as Pickett's Charge and the 20th Maine's defense of Little Round Top, but the excess speechifying and moralizing, along with some poor casting choices and poor production qualities, hurt this movie badly. Killer Angels the book gets a strong 5 star rating, Gettysburg the movie gets a tepid 2 star ranking at best. Gettysburg is not nearly as good as Glory, but it is mildly better than Gods and Generals.\n\nThe history of the Civil War is replete with interesting stories to tell, why can't the people at Turner Productions hire the best directors and cast to do the job right instead of cheaply and swiftly ?

This should have been a great film. But it was done in by a terrible script, and sub-par battle re-enactments. The soaring, saccharine music didn't help things either.  Gettysburg is a defining moment in American history.  The men who fought there, Union and Rebel, are heroes.  Their memory has been diminished by this movie.  Take a look at a very famous and common picture from the war.  It shows three Rebels captured at Gettysburg.  It is printed in almost every illustrated history of the war.  The men are lean, mean and almost arrogant in their pose.  Hard men, living on poor rations and forced on long, grueling marches.  Men who worked hard their whole lives and were not afraid of physical labor.  Compare them to the fat, soft looking men portraying the soldiers in this movie.  I don't believe uniforms in 1864  were manufactured in the 4xxxx size most of these ""actors"" required.  These men looked fake, they looked like lazy, beer drinking couch potatos, not the battle hardened Army of Northern Virginia.  My God, several looked out of breath running up Little Round Top. I think they needed oxygen masks off camera!!  The language and gore of battle are also kept to a minimum.  I don't pretend to be a combat veteran, but I know battle is a messy, brutal affair. I have been told many stories by WW II vets.  A bunch of fat boys being thrown in the air after a cannon shot does not portray the sheer brutality of war.  What about the screaming, wounded men littering the battlefield? Forgotten heroes. Men are torn apart by artillery.  There is cowardice and heroism in every army, and it was not shown in this film.  Instead we get long speeches, designed to bring a sentimental tear to our eyes, that never comes, punctuated by phony facial hair.";TOO MANY FAT MEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
51;95.0;5.0;5.0;4573;"Now I don't know about you, but I preferred this movie over Gods and Generals. I liked how the men in Gettysburg, most notably Jeff Bridges, managed to keep the spirit of men who fought for their beliefs alive.\n\n Jeff Bridges stars as Joshua Chamberlain, a teacher and scholar, leader of the 20th Maine division and gives a great performance. Other great characters would have to be; Martin Sheen, who should be declared a master of acting as he plays the role of Robert E. Lee, the leader of the Confederate soldiers. I now seriously consider him to be the only one who can acurately portray him, no one else would even come close.\n\nTom Berenger and Richard Jordan also give very good supporting roles in the movie as the lower captains and officers. Basically all the men who give a talking performance manages to add their little bit to this movie to make it great.\n\nNow even though the movie is about Gettysburg, there are also several other storylines in this four hour movie. My favorite would have to be the Battle of Little Round Top. Bridges and his men are forced to defend the rear of a line of union soldiers at the top of several hills. The confederates have been ordered to try and break through and then flank the unportected remaining forces of the Union army.\n\nAs soon as several attacks fail the union soldiers make a desperate charge with nothing but empty guns and bayonets fixed ont their rifles. ""Sir, i'm ordering these confederates around with an empty rifle!"" One of my favorite quotes in that part of the movie.\n\nThere are other great reinactments of several battles, but the one that stole the show was when the Confederalists marched toward the town of Gettysburg as thousands of Union soldiers waited for them. I thought that it was very moving for the Confederalists to march with their friends and possibly family members, knowing that most of them might not come back. {The Union forces were firing cannons at them as the walked at least 2 miles over open ground.\n\nAnother great scene would have to be when Lee rode into a large group of his men in order to wish them good luck. It was very powerful to see his men cheer him and rush up to shake his hand. A great moment that shows anyone can have a hero to look up to.\n\nAnyway this is one great movie. I guarantee you that you will find yourself wanting to see the entire movie without skiping any scenes, at least if you want to see just how good this movie can get. A powerful and touching film, and It will leave you breathless....";Great action supported by great acting...

We bought the DVD of ""Gettysburg"" at the gift shop, watched it that night, and went back the following day for a more in-depth battlefield tour.\n\nActually visiting the places where, for example, the 20th Maine made its desperate stand, brought a lot more meaning to the movie.\n\nJeff Daniels stole the show as the scholar-turned-soldier Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His sidekick, the ""tough old Mick"" Kilrain, who called him ""Colonel, Darlin,"" without being the least bit disrespectful, was perfect. The heart-stopping moment when Chamberlain realizes that his men are out of ammunition and must nonetheless keep the Confederates from reaching the summit of Little Round Top makes the viewer wonder: ""What, in the name of God, would I do in that situation?"" When Chamberlain orders his men to ""fix bayonets,"" and then charge downhill, it's an awesome thing.\n\nI liked Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I thought that he had the Virginia accent down pretty well for a ""furriner,"" and he carried a weary dignity about him.  It was said of Lee that his men would, and often did, follow him into Hell.  Sheen's portrayal suggested that kind of magnetism.\n\nThis isn't a movie to go into without having done your homework first.  It really helps to know something about how the Civil War was going up to that point, who the major players were, and what the main issues were. There are so many characters and so many shifts back and forth that you can get a disoriented ""Who's on First"" kind of feeling. Reading Michael Shaara's book first would also be very helpful.\n\nI found Tom Berenger's portrayal of General Longstreet to be up to his usual high standard, but the makeup people who pasted his beard on did a horrible job.  It made him look like a dimestore Santa.\n\nOne note that I found interesting was that the Yankees fought for the Union. Period.  The Confederates, on the other hand, fought for their individual states.  The Virginians, for example, fought for mother, home and family - and the honor of Virginia.  They thought of themselves not as Confederates, or even Americans, but first and foremost, as Virginians.\n\nThis movie is not light, mindless entertainment.  It is demanding and emotionally wrenching.  Gettysburg is part of our history - a part of who we are.\n\nThis telling of the story is absolutely first-class.";Almost Like Being There
53;96.0;4.0;5.0;4613;Having watched Gettysburg four times and then having gone back and reread Michael Shaara's book, I have come to the conclusion that Maxwell has done an honorable job of translating Shaara's book to film.  However, Martin Sheen's portrail of Robert E Lee is so poorly done that it seriously detracts from the overall satisfaction of the movie.\n\n  Lee was a deeply religious man.  He was very open about his faith in God and considered it to be the central anchor of his life.  Martin Sheen seems to think that if he was religious, that must mean that General Lee had an ethereal look in his eyes and stared off into space a lot.  There are scenes where Sheen's General Lee looks like he is trying to hear voices that are telling him where he left his lunch.  It was very distracting and diminished the enjoyment of the movie considerably.\n\n  General Lee's horse, Traveler, was by all accounts a magnificent animal.  I suspect that Martin Sheen is not very comfortable around horses because the animal in the movie can't be much bigger than a shetland pony.  There is a scene toward the end of the movie, just before the disasterous Rebel charge up Cemetary Ridge, where Sheen is riding Traveler in front of the cheering soldiers.  He looks less like a great general and more like an uncomfortable dude whose head bounces like a bobblehead doll.\n\n  Had this portrail not been so bad, I would gladly have give the movie five stars.  The scenes of Chamberland and the 20th Maine on Little Round Top are inspiring.  The portrail of the first and second day buildup to the battle and Pickett's charge are well done and follow Shaara's book faithfully enough.  At nearly four hours, the movie is long, but this really didn't bother me, so was the actual battle, after all.\n\n  I can easily recommend the movie to others, I only wish that Sheen had had a better insight into his portrail of Lee.;Fine rendering of Shaara's book -- Terrible portrail of Lee

So often in today's world of ""dumbed down"" history the opposite is true - slavery is often the only reason given for why the civil war was fought. This is a disservice both to history and to our educational system.\n\n Thankfully, ""Gettysburg"" is at least fair enough to look at both sides and not blithely jump on the politically correct bandwagon. Yes, Lincoln wanted to free the slaves and many in the Union fought for that reason, but many did not, just as many in the South were not fighting specifically to defend it. As a southern prisoner of war in the movie states, ""I don't care much about the 'darkies' one way or the other....I'm fightin for my 'rats'"".\n\n The movie itself is gripping and rarely boring. My one criticism are the occasional preachy scenes (such as Chamberlain and Kilrain discussing the black race), but there aren't that many and it's almost to be expected in today's cinema.\n\n Sheen is excellent as Lee and Berenger decent as Longstreet (could they have redone his beard, perhaps?)....but as others have said, Jeff Daniels steals the show as Chamberlain. But perhaps the most powerful single scene in the movie is performed by Richard Jordan as Armistead, when speaking to Longstreet about his very close friend Winfield Hancock who is now commanding part of the Union army just a couple miles away. His reluctance to fight someone as close as a brother to him is certainly a theme often discussed regarding the civil war (brother vs. brother, friend vs. friend) and Jordan does a perfect job bringing this unfortunate paradox to life.\n\n Cinematography and score are first rate. You really don't want the movie to end. Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.....you might even learn something too.";Excellent in almost every respect

Based on the bestselling novel 'The Killer Angels' by Michael Shaara, Gettysburg is an engaging and [MOSTLY accurate] retelling of the events surrounding what was probably the most major battle of the War of Northern Agression (no offense to anyone, I AM a southerner, but I harbor no serious prejudices toward anyone).  Some minor details, such as Chamberlain's position during the battle are slightly off, but most of the historical action is dead on.  Martin Sheen delivers an excellent performance as Gen. Robert E. Lee.  Although this movie was released earlier, 'Gods and Generals' by Jeff Shaara (same name as the book, and Michael Shaara's son) precedes Gettysburg in historical order.

I disagree with those who feel that Robert Duvall did better as General Lee than Martin Sheen. We see more of Lee in ""Gettysburg"" than we do in ""Gods and Generals"" and therefore we get to know Lee  better in ""Gettysburg"" and Sheen did a great job of being the great General Robert Edward Lee, the best Army Commander America has ever seen. The scenes at Pickett's Charge are nothing short than stunning...! When that enourmous line of 15 000 Confederates advance across that field only to be slaughtered by the awaiting Yankees... Horrific.\nIn the end, the battle at Gettysburg decided the outcome of the Civil War. If General Lee had won again at Gettysburg, the Confederacy might have won the war. One can never know, but Lee's army never quite recovered after the defeat at Gettsyburg.\nTo put in General Lee's words: ""Too bad. Too bad... Oh!

I take the opposite view that Duvall was at best a mediocre Lee hardly showing any emotion at all.  I felt virtually nothing for the man in his performance as Lee.  He also is not on the screen very much.  We really never get to know him or like him.  On the other hand, Sheen as Lee is someone who truly has emotions, he cares about his troops, we see him in a human light and we like him. We see more of him in Gettysburg and we get to know him.

It has nice speaches which express the characters thoughts and emotions well, especially Chamberlains speech about freedom, and an the war, Busters speech about why hes fighting the war and about the evil doings back in Ireland, and Armisteads speach to the British military observer (Freemantle) about his men and thier duty and heritage.

60;73.0;5.0;7.0;4848;"First off, anyone gripping about the small budget effect of battle about this film needs to STOP and understand it WAS a small budget film.  This film was NEVER EVER intended for Theatrical release.  Only, the power of the film, demanded it be shown on big screen.  Michael Shaara's book ""Killer Angels"" on of the most moving look of the men that set the nightmare of Gettysburg into action, was given a new life with Ted Turner's group.  It was created to be run on TNT, his cable/satellite station in two parts.  So yes, the casting went with actors more in line with Telly than Theatre, yes, it had to cut corners on budget.  Does that affect the quality of the film?  No one bit.  Anyone grumping about the cannons not recoiling is nitpicking.\nAnd for people fusing about 5000 Civil War re-enactors (including Ted Turner manning one of the non-recoiling cannons) being unpaid.  Well, ASK THEM.  The re-enactors thought this was a chance of a lifetime to record what they do annually anyway!\nThe movie was intended to address the personal side of the war, the friendships torn apart by deferences in belief, the frustration, the futility.\nRichard Jordon's Emmy nominated performance alone is worth the price.  With fine work by numerous supporting actors such as Sam Elliot and Stephan Lang.\nSo one should not grip about what it is not - and was never intended to be - but appreciate the fine effort that is it.  One of the most moving looks at such a tragic period in history.";heartfelt look at America's most tragic battle

62;5.0;4.0;223.0;4953;"""Gettysburg"" is perhaps the best attempt by any film to capture a single battle from beginning to end. It is not a movie for everyone since there is no artificially-embedded love story (as in. ""Pearl Harbor""), and in fact, there are no women in this movie at all.  It sets out to depict the largest battle ever fought on the American continent.  Its success is the product of the deliberate choice of the director to respect the source material, namely one of the finest historical war novels ever written, ""The Killer Angels"", by Michael Shaara.\nGettysburg is a battle of superlatives.  It was the largest and bloodiest encounter battle of the Civil War, adding up the three days between July 1 and July 3, 1863, and it tore the heart out of the Lee's Army of Northern Virginia..  It is also the most controversial battle, generating more than its share of debates over decisions and tactics.  Was Lee off his game at Gettysburg, as Shaara suggests?  Or, as other historians argue, was the battle lost by ""Old Pete"" Longstreet's case of the ""slows"" on July 2 (the attack on Devil's Den and Little Round Top) and July 3 (Pickett's Charge)?  Longstreet's postwar memoirs lay the blame for Pickett`s Charge squarely at Lee's feet, but since Longstreet joined the Republican party after the war, many Southerners are quick to blame him for Lee's defeat.\nShaara's book, and therefore the film, makes choices in this debate.  Shaara sides with Longstreet (aptly played by Tom Beringer), who is depicted as a thoughtful, reluctant warrior who vocally opposes the sanguinary frontal assaults launched by Lee on July 2nd and July 3rd .  (For a different perspective, I highly recommend Noah Trudeau's latest book, ""Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage."")\nIt is a delight to see the musty daguerreotypes of Civil War leaders come to life as living, breathing characters.  For the Confederates, Tom Berringer's Longstreet is tops, followed by Confederate generals ""Lo"" Armistead (Richard Jordan) and Stephen Lang `s amazing George Pickett, a stunning contrast to Lang's later alabaster imitation of Christ as Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson in ""Gods and Generals.""  These are interesting, complex people, and ""Gettysburg"" even manages a sense of humor.  The debate on Darwin between Pickett and Armistead is funny, concluding with Pickett defying any Southern gentleman to openly claim that ""Robert E. Lee is descended from an ape."" On the Union side, there is Jeff Daniels as the bookish hero Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as the hard-bitten cavalry general Buford, and Brian Mallon's pugnacious General Winfield Scott Hancock.\nSome die-hard grognards have complained that ""Gettysburg"" glosses over details of the battle.  But Shaara, and the film, were right to concentrate on the highlights: the initial skirmish and ultimate Union rout on July 1, the confused battle for Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, and the against-all-odds defense of Little Round Top on July 2 by Joshua Chamberlain's (Jeff Daniels) 20th Maine; and, of course, Pickett's Charge.  Massive volumes have been written about just one day of the three day battle, and any film which tried to cover it all would be a ponderous bore.\nThe few speeches in the movie are necessary, I suppose, to explain the larger motives for the war.  Jeff Daniels' Chamberlain has to give the obligatory Abolitionist speech, and Armistead trys to explain the Southern ""Cause"" to the English camp follower Freemantle just before Pickett's Charge.  The few speeches in `Gettysburg""  hint at the malignancy that emerges full flower in ""Gods and Generals"" (written by a different Shaara) in which the camera's pause on any character become the excuse for a five to ten minutes of pious blather.\nThe flaws of the film are few.  One major flaw is Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee as an unblinking somnambulist, whose approach to strategy is by mumbling ""it is God's will"" as officers rush up with dispatches.  Robert Duvall's more animated Lee is the only (and I mean only improvement) that ""Gods and Generals"" has on ""Gettysburg.""  Sheen's wide-eyed robot Lee is hard to square with the historical brilliance of Lee at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville, and contemporary accounts of Lee as a witty conversationalist, a battlefield gambler, and with an eye for the ladies.\nTed Turner's use of thousands of amateur reenactors to stage the battle is both a blessing and a curse, but mostly a blessing.  Let's face it - the authentically-decked out and equipped amateur soldiers look far more like the real thing than the standard Spanish rent-an-army employed in similar epics such as ""Waterloo.""  However, I suspect that the troops in the movie, particularly on the Southern side, are cleaner, neater, better fed and older (lots of retired folks are reenactors) than the actual participants in the battles.  (A common observation of the time was that you could smell Lee's troops approaching before you would see them).  The other problem with reenactors is they object to having their limbs and heads blown off, or torsos reduced to bloody pulp by cannon balls.  This is not ""Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"" - these soldiers, even when blasted by cannon, die clean deaths, and do not convey the historical eyewitness accounts of the horror, not to mention thousands of corpses set out in the hot July sun.  But these are very minor quibbles.  This is as good a re-enactment using real people as you can expect.\nI recommend ""Gettysburg"" for historical movie fans, and do not forget the wonderful Ken Burns' documentary, ""The Civil War.""";"""Gettysburg"" holds true to Shaara's book"

His acent was not belivable at all, he sounded more like he was from South Boston rather than Virginia.  And what was with his hat?  Wasn't he carrying it most of the movie?

Battle is about blood and gore, and about death and destruction. Wars are ugly--arguably necessary from time to time but grotesque in their very premise. Organized  killing should not be sanitized, for to do so mimimizes its horror. If we are to make and watch films about war, then we should watch the truth. Only then will the cinema remind us of the cost of war and the need, when possible, to avoid it. To sanitize battle scenes in the hope that viewers will not be offended is to diminish the sacrifice made by those who really died in the real war being depicted.

Three fields of battle (one for each day) were highlighted in this movie: the initial engagement on the Chambersburg Pike, the 20th Maine's repulse of  the Alabamans at the base of Little Round Top, and Pickett's Charge.\nThe exclusions were baffling.  How in the world could a movie calling itself ""Gettysburg"" completely ignore the most controversial event of the entire three days?  Dan Sickles' unilateral decision to abandon his position on Little Round Top might as well have never happened.  And since there was no Sickles, there could be no heroics by Warren.  There's a statue of the man on Little Round Top, shouldn't he perhaps be included in the movie?\nThe Peach Orchard and the Wheatfield were only mentioned in passing.  It was said that the Wheatfield was so full of dead soldiers that you could walk across it without touching the ground.  How could this not merit something more than a throw away line by Longstreet (Tom Berenger)?\nYou could argue that the movie was already four hours long, so you had to cut something.  And you would be right.  But the dialogue was populated with too much character development dialogue, speeches, and sermons.  How many times did we have to hear about the Armistead - Hancock friendship before they beat that horse to death?  OK, OK, brother against brother, we get it - move on.  Was it really necessary to show us that Pickett was a raconteur more than once?  Love him or hate him, Dan Sickles' story is far more interesting.\nNeither the 20th Maine's defense of Little Round Top nor Pickett's Charge would have suffered from some time compression.  Both were excellently done.  But I would have gladly traded one or two Alabama assaults, and a whole bunch of drumming, walking Virginians for something of what transpired at the Peach Orchard and the Wheatfield.\nI haven't even mentioned the Slaughter Pen and the Valley of Death, Spangler's Spring, Culp's Hill, Cemetery Hill or Custer at the East Cavalry Battlefield.  But then again, the movie didn't much address them either.  To their credit, they did say the words ""Devil's Den"" a couple of times.\nAs for historic accuracy, I have to say they were right on.  I used my battlefield tour guidebook as a supplement to understanding the movie, and the flow of the battles depicted agreed to the guidebook.\nI can't speak for the movie's adherence to ""Killer Angels"", having never read the book, but the movie was called ""Gettysburg"", which is a wide scope indeed.

And though you can quibble about a few of the dtetails, they succeed quite well.  The movie is based on the hugely popular novel, ""The Killer Angles,"" which placed dialog in the mouths of the leaders who fought the battle and breathed life back into the legends.  The movies is quite faithful to the book, and places its emphasis on Maine Colonel Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) as well as Confedrate Generals Lee (Martin Sheen) and Longstreet (Tom Berriger).\nThe DVD version of the movie places the whole 254 minutes on one double-sided disk.  The film looks terrific and there are a number of extras, including a ""Making Of"" sequence and a documentary of the battle itself.

The story moves like it really is unfolding second-for-second, the characters yak on and on about inconsequential details, and the central narrative thrust is -- well, there isn't one.\nI don't think I've ever been as bored by any war film.  Even historical essays make for a more exciting experience.  Maxwell's characters refer endlessly to small details, yet we are never told what those details mean in the grand scheme of things.  Worst of all, there is never any conflict -- the root of all works of drama.  The stakes are low, there is endless talk and little action, and when the battle scenes do occur, they are perhaps the most lifeless ever filmed.  The charge down the hill, for example, was referred to as a suicidal gesture, yet the Union soldiers simply seem to waltz right through their enemy without any sense of danger.  Maxwell simply has no idea how to either write or direct a good, tense dramatic scene.\nMiserable acting caps the whole deal off.  Martin Sheen has never looked more ridiculous as here, ironically, where he plays Robert E. Lee, one of the most charismatic generals in U.S. history and certainly one of the Civil War's figureheads.  Tom Berenger's performance could have been given by any number of bit players.  Even on the music front the film is an utter failure.  The usually resourceful Randy Edelman's score somehow sounds entirely anachronistic, possibly due to a generic orchestral arrangement without specific flavour, and there is entirely too much of it, as if Maxwell is trying to rely on the music to generate some kind of interest.  And he is -- trying, that is, and failing miserably.\nI feel insulted when this film is compared to -- and, horrifically, sometimes even cited above -- the 1989 Civil War classic Glory, which featured an immortal performance from Denzel Washington and astonishing writing, directing, cinematography, editing, sound, and music.  And Glory took a little over two hours to say oceans more about the Civil War than Gettysburg does in its entire four-hour running length.

All in all, it covers the major events of the battle, but certainly does not cover everything, but that's ok. It is simply the best movie/docudrama ever made about the Battle of Gettysburg that has hit the big screen. I didn't say it was the best overall and accurate portrayal of the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a great general view of it.\nA lot of criticism has been aimed at this movie by Civil War buffs, mainly because of factual errors of who was on what part of the battlefield, whether or not the men cheered Lee right before Pickett's Charge, etc. I think those errors are there mainly because this movie is based on a work of fictional drama, the book ""The Killer Angels"", by Michael Shaara.\nI loved Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, absolutely adored Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Sam Elliot as General Buford, and thought Kevin Conway's portrayal of the fictional ""Kilrain"", was stupendous! Richard Jordan's final performance as General Armisted, is compassionate and fantastic. I didn't like Martin Sheen cast as General Lee, I think he did as good a job as he could have, but wouldn't have cast his as Lee in a million years!

Upon watching this movie, it is impossible to decide who are the 'good guys' and who are the 'bad guys.'\nThis is the main reason why this movie is so great--it accurately portrays the underlying aspect of the Civil War; there were no 'good guys', and nobody 'won'.  This movie shows this tragic fact--that even the so-called 'victors' (the North) lost a great deal from the war.\nAs mentioned, the use of characters in this movie is moving.  There are officers who'd served together in previous conflicts, men who respected one another greatly, even two best friends.  I don't think it was possible for anyone to hate the enemy, or even to rightly call him 'enemy.'

And this is one of those rare movies that was destined and deserved nothing less than the silver screen.  A few names jump out at you right away: Martin Sheen in his most inspired and meaningful performance, just breathing life and artistry into the character of Robert E. Lee.  Tom Berenger was never more perfectly cast than as the Alabamian James Longstreet.  Honestly, perfect.  Jeff Daniels was exciting and energetic as Joshua Chamberlain, a relative of mine, no kidding, and he is truly awe inspiring, the way he comes from no military background and leads his men in superb order, just as good as any of the career soldiers.  And finally, special guest appearance by Sam Elliot.  Special guest appearance???  Elliot's guest appearance as the underlauded and underappreciated John Buford was forceful and personal.  Not only did Buford hold the ground for the approaching Union Army, but Elliot held down the film until Sheen, Berenger and Daniels took over the movie.  The cinematography is beautiful, the locations are truly majestic.  The score is wonderful, fusing the guitars in with a symphonic orchestra.  The costumes and the way in which they were worn and preferred by different officers is very true to form.

The more important thing here is the commaradery felt between men on both sides and the men on the different sides, highlighted by the touching depcitions of pre-war friendship of Lo Armistead and Winfield Scott Hancock.  Some fought for rights, others fought for mere pride, others fought because it seemed lke the right thing to do.  But what you learn by the end of this movie is that the only thing they were fighting for, was each other.";Grand and sweeping spectacle

I saw it first in the theater eight years ago and watch parts of the film over and over. Scenes and people are realistic. People fighting for their ""rats"" (a Northerners misunderstanding of the Southern pronunciation of ""rights"") offers an interpretation of the causes of the war.\nFor me, there are valuable illustrations of life today available in scenes from 'Gettysburg'.\nWhen Lee disciplines Stuart for his absence, we see a perfectly executed reprimand. Leaders in business today can learn from Lee's excellent, effective use of punishment.\nWhen Lee takes three minutes to tell Longstreet his vision for what we now refer to as ""Pickett's Charge"", we learn how a clear, simple vision can also be the recipe for disaster, even if Pickett and his charges came within minutes or feet of carrying the day.\nChamberlain's speech to the mutinous troops at the onset of the film offers lessons on the power of persuasive speaking. And, immediately preceding the speech, we see how Chamberlain leads by example, as he starts his morning.\nLiving just down the road a piece from Pennsylvania and the national battlefield, I can appreciate just how close Lee came to winning the battle, the day, and, perhaps, the war. This a a great lesson in history with scenes worth waching and appreciating today.";Lessons to be learned: Riveting history comes alive
74;75.0;5.0;7.0;5436;"""Gettysburg"" is a monumental effort to depict the Civil War events of July 3-5,1863 in Pennsylvania and succeeds magnificently on all levels. Both from an historical and theatical perspective, this movie is a ""must-see"". On the historical side, this movie manages to portray the personalities with both historical accuracy and believability...one cannot help but like and admire the principals on both sides. Tom Berenger is magnificent as ""Ol' Pete"" Longstreet as is Jeff Daniels playing Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain...I had a little harder time accepting Martin Sheen as R.E. Lee. Although wonderfully acted, Sheen just did not fit my impressions of Lee (I probably have seen him too much on ""West Wing""). The battle scenes, to me, were the best I've seen in movie form...both the 20th Maine's stand on Little Roundtop and Pickett's charge were amazingly portrayed and highly accurate...I could not find any historical in-acurracies in any of these scenes (I don't consider myself an expert in Civil War military tactics, however). From a theatrical perspective, this had all the high quality cinematography and direction that makes for epic films...both the battle scenes and the one-on-one personal encounters were wonderfully depicted. For anyone interested at all in the Civil War or anyone wanting to watch a classic movie, this is one to see. I highly recommend it!";Epic depiction and surprisingly accurate...
75;105.0;5.0;5.0;5530;"If for no other reason than his production of GETTYSBURG, Ted Turner deserves to be remembered with thanks by generations of filmgoers to come -- long after everyone has forgotten the flap over colorization.\nWhen you think about it, the idea was a natural. Bring together some talented Hollywood actors, a very competent director, and join them with thousands of Civil War re-enactors -- those hardy hobbyists who live to commemorate the War Between the States. No other war film can boast thousands of authentically dressed extras for the many battle scenes. The result is an epic sweep which really gives one an idea what a tragedy the death of 55,000 brave Americans looked and felt like.\nBecause Civil War re-enactors tend to be over 40 and a bit generous of girth, the soldiers may not have looked quite like the gaunt figures captured by the cameras of Matthew Brady. No matter: They more than made up for it in enthusiasm.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we see three parts of the battle. First Union Cavalry General Buford (ably played by Sam Elliott) takes possession of the town of Gettysburg and its adjacent high ground and keeps the battle hot until the infantry arrives. On the second day is the brilliant defense of Little Round Top by Col Chamberlain (played by Jeff Daniels) and his 20th Maine Regiment at the far left of the 20-mile-long Union Line. The climax comes with Pickett's Charge on the third day against the center of the Union Line.\nWe see the action primarily from the point of view of the South. While the commander of the Union forces, General Meade (Richard Anderson), appears in only one short scene, there are numerous meetings between General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) and Robert E Lee (a superb performance by Martin Sheen). We get to meet and know Pickett (Stephen Lang), Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan), and several other members of the Confederate General Staff. On the Northern side, there are all too few scenes with Winfield Scott Hancock, the general who takes the full brunt of Pickett's charge.\nSince I saw the premiere of this film on TNT in 1993, I have come back to it again and again; and I am particularly happy to have obtained the DVD recently. If you like the Civil War, if you like history, if you like war films, if you like GREAT films, you too will come back for more.";Epic Sweep, a Cast of Thousands, and Some Great Acting
76;7.0;5.0;57.0;5543;"This movies is my all-time favorite for the war genre.  It was well worth the $20 million price tag for Turner Pictures.  Gettysburg is the classic war saga minus the romance along the lines of Gone With The Wind.  The performances of all the actors are splendid.  My personal favorites are the performances given by Tom Berenger as Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, Richard Jordan as Gen. Lewis Armistead, Jeff Daniels as Col. Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as Brig. Gen. John Buford, and of course Stephen Lang as Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett.  The performance by Jordan was to be his last as he became ill with a brain tumor and died 9 months after the filming of Gettysburg.  He is caught between love and war with his long-time friend Maj. Gen Winfield Hancock (Brian Mallon) on the opposing Union side.  Armistead suffers considerable agony which is obvious to even the casual viewer especially when the director Ronald F. Maxwell spends considerable time on Armistead trying to bait Lt Gen Longstreet (Tom Berenger) into relieving Armistead of the upcoming battle.  Jeff Daniels was a very big suprise for me.  I picture Daniels in the toilet scene from Dumb and Dumber and would not have cast him myself in this epic, but that just shows the genius behind casting director Joy Todd.  Sam Elliot's role as Buford can be summed up in the following quote  ""Meade will come in slowly, cautiously, new to command... And then, after Lee's army is entrenched behind nice fat rocks, Meade will attack finally, if he can coordinate the army. He'll attack right up that rocky slope, and up that gorgeous field of fire. And we will charge valiantly, and be butchered valiantly. And afterwards men in tall hats and gold watch fobs will thump their chest and say what a brave charge it was. Devin, I've led a soldier's life, and I've never seen anything as brutally clear as this""...wonderful!  Alot of love was given to the filming of this movie.  5,000 non-paid re-enactors were hired to play the roles of the thousands of anonymous faces.  Even Ted Turner himself picked up the musket and was among the ones counted during Pickett's charge.  He can be seen, but only for a nano-second.  I can write forever on this films' qualities but to finish it up, the accuracy in this film is phenomenal.  The greatest example of this is how Ronald F.Maxwell uses actual quotes recorded by soldiers from that famous battle.  Gen. Pickett: ""Up men, up! And let no man forget today that you are from old Virginia!""  Gen. Armistead: ""Virginians! Virginians! For your land - for your homes - for your sweethearts - for your wives - for Virginia! Forward... march!""";Old Virginia

They were entrenchments dug during the Gettysburg Campaign -- in case General Lee's forces headed north to cut off railroad lines at Altoona.  Those trenches were dug by locals but never used.  They are still clearly discernible.\n My great grandfather was Bedford County, PA's last living Civil War veteran (he died in 1942 at age 96).  He was in a PA Regiment that MISSED Gettysburg: his unit was at Vicksburg which fell the same day the battle in PA ended.\n I have viewed this movie many times.  Its careful attention to tactical details seems perfect.  The actors are well-cast despite somewhat ersatz-looking beards and moustaches.  However, considering July in PA and wool uniforms the real soldiers wore, I doubt they were much ""handsomer"" than our actors.\n A comment on General Lee.  Some have objected to Martin Sheen's portrayal.  Lee, at the time, was suffering from an increasingly harsh heart condition that, in time, would take him.  I believe that was factored into the movie, although subtly.  Sheen shows his understanding of this generally little-known fact.\n Chamberlain and Longstreet were excellently played, as was CSA General Armitage.  In fact, considering the complex nature of this work (not a 'film' but a 'work') Mr. Maxwell rates high praise.\n I visit the National Military Park at Gettysburg when my spirits flag.  Every time I reclaim my honor and love for being a U.S. citizen.  No matter which side, the men for whom Gettysburg is portrayed, all were heroes.\n The real difference? Today we are callused of spirit.  The men of Gettysburg's time had a refreshing naievete' and sentimentality.  We might be better people if we laughed and cried easier -- and for real reasons and not artifice.\n CAPT Steve Myers, USN (Ret.)";None Left That Own the T-Shirt -- but some still dream....
78;78.0;5.0;7.0;5629;"This is an outstanding film. Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer prize winning book, ""The Killer Angels"", it tells the story of the battle at Gettysburg, which took place over the first three days of July in 1863. For the most part, the film  examines that pivotal battle, one of the bloodiest of the war, from the perspective of the commanders who were calling the shots (no pun intended).\n\nThe viewer will be enthralled by the film's recreation of the battle at Gettysburg, which examines some of the militairy stratagems employed and the reasons for them. It attempts to explain how it was that over fifty thousand (50,000) men lay dead or injured at its conclusion. It also recreates one of the most amazing routs in history, when Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, defying the odds, held off the Confederates at Little Round Top, part of the high ground that the Union needed to retain at Gettysburg. Chamberlain, who was not a professional soldier but a professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor and success in holding the Confederacy at bay at Little Round Top. Jeff Daniels, who plays the role of Chamberlain, is superlative.\n\nThe rest of the star studded cast is likewise marvelous. Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Richard Jordan as General Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as General Pickett, in particular, all deserve a standing ovation, as does Jeff Daniels. This is a film that attempts to be historically accurate, and it succeeds brilliantly. It does not glamorize war, but shows it in all its heartbreaking reality. It even depicts General Pickett's audacious charge, which saw the loss of an entire division of Confederate soldiers. This is a film entirely about the men who took part in the battle at Gettysburg and the outcome that set the course for the country we know today. Kudos to director Robert F. Maxwell, who directed this film. It is simply a magnificent movie. Bravo!";CALLING ALL CIVIL WAR BUFFS...

Lee is a gross disappoinment.  It's as though he were reading cue cards, his accent sometimes on the wrong syllables even -- does Sheen speak English as a second language?  He makes a better Bill Clinton.\nWhoever plays J.E.B.

80;106.0;5.0;5.0;5725;"Movie:\nIt's easy to make a bad Civil War film. It's easy to focus on the racism of the South, or the greed of the North. It's easy to focus on either the bloody desperation of the battles or the heroism of the soldiers, and fail to show how they're linked. It's easy to make a film with a huge cast where most of the actors just show up for work and don't make much of an effort. It's all so very easy.\n_Gettysburg_ is a great movie because it avoids all those easy traps. The movie faithfully captures the motivations of the Confederate soldiers -- not as defenders of slavery but rather as defenders of a way of life. So, too, are captured the motivations of Federals -- fighting for ideals, whether of Union, justice, or freedom for all men. Laudably, the movie also subtly captures some of the condescension that even Northerners felt for the slaves. Notice that in the scene with the ""John Henry"" the unnamed black man is talked around, as if he were a child or an idiot; he's never addressed directly.\nThe bloody, desperate work of war is captured very well in the battle scenes, particularly in the scenes on Little Round Top. In that scene, too, the heroism of the Union soldiers in the face of almost certain death is on display. Confederates have their moments of heroism and desperation on the next day, when Armistead's brigade reaches the top, charging into near-certain death. In both instances the slaughter and heroism are presented accurately, as dual faces of a single coin, and they are balanced admirably.\nStill, the performances of the actors in this film are what makes it great. Lancaster is uneven as Freemantle, but that's the only notable acting complaint. That one low spot is overshadowed by so many fine appearances, it's hard to give them all their proper due. Jeff Daniels puts in his finest performance ever, and Tom Berenger utterly disappears into the part of Longstreet. Martin Sheen's Lee is a little more befuddled than strictly necessary, but otherwise wonderful. Sam Elliott is perfectly cast as Buford, and Stephen Lang is excellent as Pickett. Wm. Sheppard also puts in a wonderful turn as General Trimble.\nThe real show-stopper, however, is Richard Jordan as Lo Armistead. His performance provides the emotional core of the film, dealing most intimately with the Civil War's central irony: these savage battles were fought between friends. His last words in the film sound like a eulogy to every man who fell in the war. Anyone not moved by his final scene has a heart of stone.\nIn short, this is easily the best Civil War film ever made, and arguably the best movie ever made about any war. _Gettysburg_ perfectly blends history with moviemaking, and the result is a work of art no lover of either discipline should be without.\nDVD Version:\nThis DVD has so much bang for your buck you'd be an idiot not to buy it. In addition to the film, which as I've pointed out is excellent, it carries two well-made documentaries that cover both the history and the film-making quite effectively, a good collection of maps (with commentary), and an excellent commentary track for the film (although unfortunately it does not cover all scenes). This is one of the most relevant set of DVD bonuses I've ever seen. It's almost worth buying the player just to watch this one disk.";The good Lord don't make 'em any better
81;60.0;4.0;9.0;5736;Movies based on history fall into one of two categories.  They're either wonderful stories that are flawed on facts (Braveheart, JFK, for example), or they're faithful to the facts but lack drama (The Battle of Britain, produced by Harry Saltzman in the late '60s).  This film, written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, manages to be fairly accurate storytelling and compelling drama at the same time.  That Maxwell's movie embodies these two qualities in an almost four-hour picture is no small feat either.\nThe movie recreates the pivotal battle of the Civil War, when General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia sought to  destroy the Union forces under General George Meade at Gettysburg, a small town in Pennsylvania.  Maxwell's towering achievement in this movie, besides the many well-staged battle scenes, is to highlight the personal, emotional anguish of the soldiers on both sides, some of whom had been quite close before the war began. Witness the scene in the tent of General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) as General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan, in one of his last screen roles) speaks emotionally about his friend, General Hancock, who he knows is just over the ridge where they will attack the next day.  Tears well up in Jordan's eyes as he recalls the deep affection that he developed for Hancock and his wife many years before.\nGettysburg is not a great movie, but it is a very good one, and well worth viewing for any American who is interested in the war that tore this nation asunder and, in some ways, made it more unified afterwards.;Good History, Good Film
82;27.0;5.0;19.0;5770;"Ronald Maxwell's ""Gettysburg"" is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Based on Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The Killer Angels"", this film carefully and enthrallingly details the major events of July 1, 2 and 3, 1863.  This battle, which proved to be the pivotal engagement of the American Civil War and, arguably, all of American history, is depicted, in surprisingly human terms, through the eyes of three men:  General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen), legendary commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, who faces what could be the final victory or defeat of his army.  James Longstreet (Tom Berenger), Lee's second in command, who finds himself torn between loyalty to his commander, and grave misgivings about Lee's strategy.  And Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels), the newly promoted Union Colonel who suddenly find his small band of battle weary troops placed in the key position of Union defense, a position that must be held at all costs.  The battle sequences are played out in appropriately grand and authentically raw fashion, with stirring music and moments of surprising poignancy, such as the beautiful and heroic spectacle of the doomed Pickett's charge.  What is perhaps most surprising though, is how compelling the non-battle scenes are.  It is quite a task to maintain audience interest for a span of more than four hours, but this picture succeeds admirably through fine introspective writing, moments of unexpected humor, and remarkable performances.  The ordinarily mediocre Jeff Daniels, for instance, turns in what may be his best screen performance and Tom Berenger is also at the top of his game.  Sam Elliot's Buford is magnificent and even C. Thomas Howell does good work.  This is a film that portrays not only history, but philosophy as well, and succeeds in showing the horror as well as the glory of this complicated war.  It is a truly remarkable film.  My only complaint is that, in compiling this DVD, the decision was made to use the theatrical cut of the film.  An excellent director's cut, with something like an extra 17 minutes of footage, has long been available on Laserdisc and should have been the cut used.  This decision is the only thing to prevent this, extra-laden, DVD from being the definitive edition of Gettysburg.";Perhaps the perfect marriage of history and drama
83;107.0;5.0;5.0;5874;Martin Sheen shows General Lee as a tortured human being, a man not a God who had to deal with poor support, poor supply, and the constant worry about keeping his ramshackle army together in the midst of a wild card campaign. Lee screwed up at Gettysburg when he wouldn't listen to Longstreet and that was depicted with brilliance in the movie. Gettysburg was Lee's greatest blunder and I'd rather watch a movie showing him as a human being than as some saintly untouchable Southern icon myth.\nTed Turner put this movie together brilliantly, especially the largest collection of Civil War artillary ever fielded for an event, over 300 Napolion 20 pound field guns were used in the artillary duel before Picket's charge.\nSadly, Richard Jordon was lost to cancer after this movie, what a great actor, I will never forget his performance as Lou Armsted.;General Lee was human
84;81.0;5.0;7.0;5905;Gettysburg has to be my favorite movie of all time. I am disappointed that the extra scenes are not part of the DVD, for those explained in a little more detail the Confederate debacle in front of Cemetery Hill. Although there are some historical flaws, and some of the beards are pretty goofy looking, I felt that the movie was historically accurate. I think there should have been more details about the second day then there was. Not once in the movie was the bloody fight of the first Minnesota mentioned (The book passively mentioned it). However, the drama of Chamberlain's charge gets me every time I see it, as does Pickett's charge. To top it off, Randy Edelman's soundtrack is beautiful and appropriate. I have to admit that I have only seen it through one time (However, I have probably seen it a dozen times if I combine the partial viewings.)

Its what dvds are specially known for, their compression to have more room on a disc. Why not just have the movie itself on one disc and the extras on another.

Gettysburg is not only based on history but is an accurate portrayal of the most famous battle of the Civil War.  The movie is amazing accurate, but is far from a documentary.  It does a wonderful job of intertwining historical fact and drama.\nWhile the battle scenes are well done, especially the battle for Little Round Top, the movie excels in the personal stories.  The interplay of the West Point comrades in the Union and Confederate armies is especially touching.  Particular attention is rightly devoted to Confederate General Armistadt and Union General Hancock.  These two long time friends truly cared deeply for each other and knew that they would face each other during Pickett's charge.  The fact that they lay wounded, Armistadt mortally, feet from each other, provides further irony.\nAnother strength of the movie the fact that it takes on the tough historical questions that the battle raised - the chief one being whether Lee should have engaged Meade at Gettysburg or elsewhere.  The conflict is brought to the screen through crisp dialogue between Lee and Longstreet.  The dialogue is first class; however other than the fact that the failure of Pickett's charge may have proved Lee wrong the broader historical aspects of Lee's decisions are not dealt with.\nThis was a great movie.  Even though I knew the outcome before the movie started I enjoyed it and have watched it several times.  At times I felt that I was with General Burford and the Iron Brigade at Cemetery Ridge, General Chamberlain and the 20th Maine atop Little Round Top or General Pickett as he began his ill fated charge.

Unlike the Movie produced by Turner, General Lee was far from confused about his invasion of the North in 1863.  And while he did rely heavily on Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry for his intelligence and to screen the main Army's movements, Turner made it look as though Stuart's absence was one of the main reasons for the Confederate defeat...which certainly wasn't the case.  And Lee wasn't without Cavalry, as Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry was on hand.  Another problem I had was this movie also made Longstreet look more brilliant and even-headed than Lee.  While Longstreet was an able commander, especially at the Corps and Division level, he was no Lee.\nI enjoyed the story line and the focus on the first day's actions with Maj. General John Buford holding Seminary Ridge against overwhelming odds.  I also enjoyed Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain, and his speech prior to the action on Little Round Top.  And Pickett's Charge made me weep.  But, my Southern Pride (I was born in Tennessee and raised in Kentucky) was stung by the confused and indecisive prortrayal of Lee by Martin Sheen (someone seemed to forget that General Lee was over six feet tall and rather angular, Sheen being considerably shorter and less angular...).  General Lee certainly did have a reason for invading the North and wasn't as confused as portrayed in this film.\nBesides General Lee's portrayal, a very Historically accurate film, and good entertainment.;Great Epic Feature, but General Lee Looked Confused...
88;11.0;4.0;38.0;5958;"""Gettysburg"" brings one of the best Civil War novels ever written to colorful life. This is a movie about a battle, no doubt about it, and the filmakers have avoided trying to appeal to the widest range of people. Those looking for period romance should look elsewhere.\nGettysburg was the pivotal battle in the Eastern theatre of the Civil War, with the Federal army winning the only clear-cut victory they were to achieve after Malvern Hill. The movie follows five main characters:Union Brigadier General John Buford, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the Union 20th Maine, rebel Brigadier General Lewis Armistead, rebel Lieutenant General James Longstreet, and rebel General Robert E. Lee. Through these men the story of the Battle of Gettysburg is told.\nThe filming is well done, but as the movie was orginally intended for release as a TV miniseries, the resolution is low. Reenactors were used to depict the two mighty armies who clashed in Pennsylania in July, 1863. They know their hobby: uniforms are meticulously accurate and the view of army life in camp and upon the field of glory feels right. That said, some of the reenactors are pretty overweight, and the Confederates especially lack that ""lean and hungry"" look that period sources describe.\nSeveral key portions of the battle are covered in depth. The first day is probably the best done: Buford's skillful defense of the high ground to the south of Gettysburg, the rout of the Union right, and the death of General Reynolds are all shown, and the viewer feels the ebb and flow of the fight. The second day focuses on the action at Little Round Top, and that is all. This appraoch works well in the movie, but the climactic fight around the Peach Orchard, the Wheat Field, and Culp's Hill is overlooked. The third day gives up the chance to show us the clash of sabers as Custer charges Stuart's tired troopers and Kilpatrick sacrifices his men in a series of headlong charges against Confederate infantry. Instead, the movie makers choose to focus on Pickett's charge. It is VERY well done. Long lines of rebel infantry advance on the angle, and the enormity of their defeat is readily apparent.\nThe performances are all top-notch. Martin Sheen's Lee is not quite the charismatic leader of men that the real Lee was, but his agonizing over decisions and simple faith in God will help viewers to identify with the great man. John Buford is played extremely well by veteran Western actor Sam Elliot. But the best performances are turned in by Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain.\nLook for Ted Turner, playing a rebel officer, to get shot down during Pickett's charge, and Civil War filmmaker Ken Burns, as a Federal staff officer begging General Hancock to seek cover during the Confederate bombardment.";A Very Faithful Adaptation of Shaara's Novel!

It is a bit long, but it is a brilliant film.;Excellent Adeptation
90;82.0;5.0;7.0;5976;"Why do I give Gettysburg 5 stars?  Here's why:\n 1.  This is one of the few films that really stays true to the novel it was based upon (The Killer Angels) - the directors and writers do take a little leeway, but it is very minimal, and I applaud them for sticking to the book.\n 2.  The acting and the screenplay in this film really give the viewer an excellent understanding of both sides, North and South, as well as several of the individual players from each side (Chamberlain and Hancock from the Union, and numerous figures from the South - Lee, Longstreet, Armistead among others).  What this accomplishes is that there is a lot of sympathy generated for both sides - even though the Southern cause is not PC today, slavery enters into the film a lot less than does simply the Southern desire for independence.  For the North, Chamberlain explains towards the beginning (to paraphrase) 'some of us came because we wanted adventure, because we thought it would be fun, others came out of a sense of duty or honor.  Others came simply because it was the right thing to do'.\n 3.  The cinematography and overall look of the film are very well done, especially picket's charge.  The only quible most folks seem to have is the 'phoney' beards - I admit on a few characters they do seem phoney, but most seem to be pretty good - and the film certainly does not coward away from this fact - during the opening credits a photo of the actor for each major character is cross faded into a photo of the actual person.\n 4.  Although its probably 'dumbed down' a little, especially in the script, the movie does a good job explaining the strategies and tactics involved.  Most movies on similar subjects simply assume that the viewer is not intellegent enough to understand this and so it simply gets glossed over.  Gettysburg's only flaw here is that it goes out of its way too much to explain the strategy, as the dialogue often features the characters explaining and rather ackwardly re-explaining the tactics.  Net result is that the film seems to think that the viewers are intellegent enough to understand, but only after its drummed into their brains 5 times.\n 5.  The acting is first rate thoughout the film, particulary the emotions captured by the actors.  Armistead and Chamberlein in particular are very well acted by Jordan and Daniels.  I don't think anyone who has seen Gettysburg could help but get chills up and down their spine when Chamberlein calls for the bayonet charge to defend the Little Round Top and screams his call for ""Bayonets!"" at the top of his lungs.  Armistead, though, in particular steals the show in the second half of the film and has all of the most emotional lines of dialogue.  First, he illuminates the Southern cause by explaining to a British observer how all of his men are 'sons of Virginia', concluding by saying (to paraphrase, again) ""Go back and tell your queen, tell her that ALL of Virginia was here today"".  Then he exaults his men to charge the field even though he and they know they will suffer massive casualties - ""Virginians!  Virginians!  For your lands!  For your homes!  For your sweethearts!  For your wives!  For Virginia!  Forward, march!""  As the charge gets pinned down to spur his men on he steps forward into the fire and screams ""Virginians!  Who will come with me?"", stabbing his sword through his hat and pointing it forward to show the way as he surges forward.  But, without doubt the most emotional and best line comes as he is lying wounded at the Union position - particularly since this is the film's best moment in capturing the real tragedy of the civil war - that it was fought brother against brother and friend against friend. Having previously explained through a couple of scenes how he and union General Hancock were best of friends before the war, he asks if he can be allowed to speak to Hancock.  When he is told that Hancock, too, has been wounded, the devestation that the real Armistead probably would have felt is captured perfectly as he emotionaly cries out in obvious physical and emotional pain ""No!  Not both of us!  Not ALL of us!  Please, God!""\n Gettysburg is not without its flaws - it probably doesn't really capture everything that went on at the battle, its a bit long at 4+ hours and starts out quite slowly, and the music is overly dramatic in some places and poorly edited in in others - but its positive aspects more than make up for this, which is why I strongly recommend this film to anyone who loves great cinema.";A magnificent film
91;110.0;5.0;5.0;5976;I've always liked this film, but a few years ago someone bought me the Director's cut (VHS) and the added scenes were a welcome addition.  When is the Director's cut coming out on DVD?  I know that Glory will be released as a 'Director's cut' in January, and I will be sure to get it when it's available.\nThis DVD has some neat features, including a complete narration of the entire film by historians should you choose that option.\nOne of the scenes in the Gettysburg Director's cut is the meeting  that Lee had with his Corps commanders, interesting conversation between him and Gen Ewell.\nGreat film!

92;4.0;5.0;308.0;5976;Many other reviewers have written about the movie Gettysburg itself, so I thought I would comment on the DVD itself.\nI have an extensive DVD collection, and if you have experienced what I have, among them are the great quality transfers and some real dogs.  Gettysburg might well be THE finest transfer I've seen.  The video (I play it on a widescreen HDTV) and audio are outstanding.  I must emphasize that the video delivers unbelievable clarity, perhaps the best I've seen. Clearly, the careful attention to detail and loving recreations that were the foundation for the original movie have been carried to the DVD with that same committment.  It is refreshing to see a studio that REALLY cares about its product.\nAs an aside, I should also mention I am an amateur Civil War historian focused on the battle of Gettysburg and of course find the film an outstanding, albeit limited, short history of the battle.  This DVD will expand other people's knowledge if they avail themselves of the feature length commentary, especially the portions by James McPherson from Princeton U.  His narrative not only amplifies details of what the movie shows, but also puts a broader perspective on it, such as other important engagements at Gettysburg such as Culp's Hill, the Wheatfield, and others.\nBottom line:  GET THIS DVD.;Outstanding transfer to DVD
93;83.0;3.0;7.0;5981;Having thoroughly enjoyed Gettysburg in the theater and on VHS, I excitedly preordered it on DVD when it became available.  After watching the DVD version I am extremely disappointed in the formatting.  Such a superb visual production should demand an anomorphic letterbox format that would give the viewer the whole picture.  This DVD doesn't - it merely gives one a cheap TV-style format.  What a waste of a great movie!  I still love the movie itself but this decision by the DVD's maufacturer is a major mistake.;A Sadly Flawed DVD
94;84.0;4.0;7.0;5983;This was a surprisingly enjoyable film. Most films about historic events of some importance in a nations past tend to lay on the saccharine by the bucket load.  Further there is often a tendency to make films on the basis that most of the audience is brain dead and every simple element has to be explained. The makers of Gettysburg don't fall into these traps and are happy to let the narrative bubble along and tell us what happened.\nThe battle is generally seen as a significant event in the history of the United States. General Lee had won a series of remarkable victories against a number of timid union generals. At every turn Lee had generally been outnumbered and out gunned.  He hoped that by defeating Meade he could negotiate and peace which would allow the South to remain independent and to continue the slave system.\nThis however was not to be and over the three day of the battle Lee and his subordinates made a series of mistakes which allowed Meade to hand on and emerge victorious. As a result the battle is seen as the high tide of the fortunes of the Confederacy. From then on the victories vanished and defeat followed defeat.\nIn America the soldiers of both sides have always been admired. Lee seemed to be a decent gentlemanly type of man even if he was fighting for a cause which we could now hardly understand. The union was fighting for values which were timeless. One of the strengths of the film is that those American viewers from the South can cheer at the bravery and courage of their side and the Northern viewers can cheer at the philosophical speeches made by their side.\nThe actors in the film look like the originals. Martin Sheen is the perfect Lee a quietly spoken gentleman who is shattered at the failure of Pickets charge. Longstreet, Picket and the others all fit into their parts.\nThe film goes for four hours but it seems shorter than that. Well worth a watch.;Surprisingly Good

This movie EXACTLY matches the book The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.\nFrom the speeches by Chamberlain and Buster on humanity, Pickett on states rights, Armistad on divided friendship, to Lee on keeping a unit together towards a common goal, there is plenty of inspiration in this movie.  Add the music, panoramic scenery, and other performances, and this movie should have won oscars.;This movie is exactly like the book Killer Angels...

Armisted was admirable; a complex part to play, considering Armisted's divided sympathies between both devotion to the State of Virginia and his love for the Union's Hancocks. What a performance Jordan handed in before he died! Not to mention Martin Sheen's equally admirable performance as Gen. Robert E. Lee - I must admit that I wouldn't go see Gettysburg because I didn't think Sheen would carry the role well: He's a dead-ringer for Gen. Ulysses S. Grant!! 1960s TV great Andrew Prine's return to the screen as Confederate General Garnett is as cool as Hitcher star C. Thomas Howell's Lieutenant Thomas Chamberlain (borther of Col. Chamberlain).\nThe action scenes in here were superbly done ... Little Round Top's surprised me, but Pickett's Charge in this film has no past comparison and is the most impressive I've ever seen: With few or no special effects, as Braveheart had aplenty, it pushed the envelope in dedication to the ""Passion of Gettysburg"" - so well carried out by the reactivated Civil War units on the same historical locations.\nA film writer myself (Isn't everbody?), I watch this one repeatedly with envy of its conception and execution of materials in a manner consistent with actual historical context and human emotions.\nHesitant to see this movie because of Daniel's contemporary appearance in Dumb and Dumber, and Sheen's casting as Lee, I now realize what a fool I'd been - I couldn't wait to buy it on tape and anxiously pre-ordered it on DVD.";"""unlike other armies, we're out to set men free"""

The worst scene is one where Lee comes  riding out and is cheered by the Confederate troops.  Actually, this scene  was not intended for the film, but was shot of the RE-ENACTORS (who were  used as extras) cheering ""Lee.""  It's too modern.\nLikewise  there is too much apology made for the efforts of the Confederacy.  While  the adored Lee (who is played by Martin Sheen as though he was on  tranquilizers the whole time) is given ample screen time, almost no  attention is paid to Meade, the Union Commander.  Indeed, many would think  that Col.

His compassionate  portrayal forever elevates my opinion of an actor whose work I had  previously dismissed as trivial and shallow. His impression of the college  professor from Maine, thrust into heroism by necessity and moral  conviction, is absolutely convincing.\nRandy Edelman's score, with its  stirring recurring theme, lends sufficient majesty and weight to the  momentous events that are portrayed on screen. I challenge anyone to remain  unmoved during Lee's review of the troops preceding Pickett's charge. The  transcendent courage of these most nobel of soldiers is as inspiring as it  is heartbreaking.\nIf you are an American, it is your civil duty to watch  this film. It should be shown in every U.S. history class. If you are from  a different culture, this film may offer one of the best insights into the  formation of the American character, as complex and multifaceted as that  may may be.;Thrilling, Heartbreaking, Educational
100;2.0;5.0;454.0;6086;"(Review updated July 25, 2015)\n\n""Gettysburg"" is one of my all-time favorite war films!  It re-creates the Civil War's battle of Gettysburg with superb acting, an excellent screenplay, a hauntingly beautiful musical score, and some of the  most authentic and stirring battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie.\n\nBased upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The  Killer Angels,""  this film follows the principal characters, and  chronicles the main events, which occurred at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from  July 1-3, 1863.  The events depicted in the film are notable for their  historical accuracy.  Some of the most exciting battle scenes in the film  are General John Buford's engagement with the Confederates on  the high  ground north of Gettysburg on July 1; the defense of Little Round Top by  Colonel Joshua Chamberlain's 20th Maine on the following day; and, of  course, Pickett's Charge on the final day of the  battle.  The battle  scenes contain plenty of smoke and fire, but are done  without copious displays of blood and gore.\n\nThe acting in ""Gettysburg"" is  excellent throughout.  Jeff Daniels , who portrays Chamberlain, probably  gives the best overall performance, but Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Tom  Berenger (Gen. James Longstreet), Sam Eliot (Buford,) Stephen Lang (Gen.  George Pickett), and Kevin Conway (Sergeant Kilrain) also give performances  which are outstanding for their realism, grittiness, and historical  accuracy.  Special mention must also go to the late Richard Jordan, whose  portrayal of Confederate General Louis Armistead was consistently eloquent  and moving.\n\nI originally purchased ""Gettysburg"" in 1999, when it was available only in VHS format. Over the past fifteen years, it has also been released in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. The Blu-ray version is the first to contain the entire film, uninterrupted,  on one disc. It corrects most of the technical flaws found in previous releases, making it, of course, technically superior to versions found on VHS and DVD. The high definition video and audio found on the Blu-ray version of ""Gettysburg"" are not what I would call reference quality, but are nevertheless excellent.\n\n""Gettysburg"" is a long movie; it runs to just over  four hours.  Still, it held me spellbound from start to finish, mainly due  to its dramatic intensity and realistic battle scenes.  I highly recommend  this outstanding film not only to Civil War enthusiasts, but for anyone who  loves a sumptuously produced and well acted war film.";A brilliant recreation of America's most famous battle!
101;71.0;4.0;8.0;6122;"There are numerous problems with this movie, but I still have watched it 50 times and never get sick of it. Despite some of the near-fatal flaws with the film, it still is riveting in sections and is always an emotional  viewing experience.\nWhat are the some of the problems? First, the make-up  department needs to have their heads examined with the plethora of terribly  cheap, fake beards in the movie. Longstreet's beard, in particular, looks  like a rabid Chia pet on steroids. The real James Longstreet never had a  beard that approached the ample levels of this beard. Tom Chamberlain's  chin whiskers are also very phony looking, as is Sheen's beard as Robert E.  Lee. Jeff Daniels' mustache, as JL Chamberlain, bears a great resemblance  to Yosemite Sam. You may think this criticism is trivial, but the movie  would have been strengthened considerably by a decent make-up department.  They also need to remove the wedding rings on the major actors. The only  Civil War general who wore a wedding ring was Ulysses S. Grant and he  wasn't at Gettysburg.\nAnother weakness is the sheer length of the movie.  Where was the editor? There are many scenes which beg to be cut: all of the  scenes with British Colonel Freemantle are superfluous, as is the later  scenes with Confederate spy Harrison. Lee's dressing down of Stuart and  Trimble are also overly long. A good hour needs to be lopped off the  film.\nThe uniforms of the major participants are also laughable. Even  after a day's battle, there is never a scratch, splotch or blood stain on  any garment. This is unrealistic. The lack of carnage and blood in all the  battles is also unrealistic.\nAnother criticism is the age and weight of  the reenactors in the film. Most seem to be in their 40's and almost all  are 100 pounds too heavy to be accurate in their bit roles. The average  Confederate soldier at Gettysburg was 20 years old and weighed 140 pounds,  some of these extra's are Orson Welles look alikes!\nBut... and this is a  *big* ""but..."" Jeff Daniels performance as Chamberlain is  outstanding, he carries the first half of the film. The scene at Little  Round Top is superlative and moving. Tom Berenger as Longstreet carries the  second half of the movie, even with his grotesque Chia-pet fake beard.  Berenger is thoughful and excellent in his role. Martin Sheen makes a  ridiculous and too-short Robert E. Lee and his accent is hardly that of a  Patrician Virginian, more like a Georgia dirt farmer.\nThe two highlights  of the movie are the Little Round Top and Pickett's charge scenes, both are  magnificent. If you want accurate civil war history, this is an uneven  treatment, but if you want an entertaining introduction into the American  civil war, this is it.";Numerous problems, but still addictive
102;6.0;5.0;102.0;6161;"July 1,2,3 of 1863 were pivotal days in our country's history. ""Gettysburg"" does an admirable job of summing up the actions and emotions of this battle in about 4 hours. This is the best Civil War movie  that you are ever going to see. Why is it so good? Here are a number of  reasons:\nONE: The Acting...There is a good amount of solid actors playing  key roles in this movie. Sam Elliot, Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels, and Tom  Berenger are the big names. They are supported by other very good actors.  They play their parts with proper accents and believability.\nTWO:  Balance...Some Civil War movies almost make the South seem like the bad  guys (""Glory"" comes to mind). No matter what part of the country  you are from, as you watch ""Gettysburg"" you feel for the fighters  on both sides. You understand the tough choices they had to make as this  movie spends even time in both army camps. In a normal movie, I would have  expected the Pickett's Charge scene to be a story of the Northerner's great  stand. In this movie, both the South and the North are given their due  during this key assault.\nTHREE: Personal Stories...This movie isn't just  about the nuts & bolts of the battle (who was stationed here, who  charged there etc...), but it also does a phenomonal job of telling the  stories mostly of the key officers in this battle: Buford, Stuart,  Chamberlain, Lee, and Longstreet. One part that was especially done well  was the struggle between two close friends, Armistead (CSA) and Hancock  (USA).\nFOUR: Soundtrack...Very appropriate and beautiful music during  different parts of the battle.\nI could go on, but I think this  highlights the strengths of this great movie. It's one that's well worth  watching.";Historically Accurate, Balanced, Fascinating
103;13.0;5.0;35.0;6217;"The archtypical battle of the Civil War is well-portrayed in this adaptation of Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"".  Like the book, and to its credit, the film is more about the men than the  battle.\nThe first half of the film focuses primarily on Joshua Lawrence  Chamberlain and the actions of the 20th Maine at Little Round Top.  This  professor-turned-soldier, superbly played by Jeff Daniels, was perhaps the  finest embodiment of the American ideal of the citizen soldier - not born  to war, but prepared to pick up the sword when necessary.  Thoughtful, yet  decisive; compassionate, but resolute.\nThe second half of the film deals  with the final day of battle - Pickett's Charge.  Generals Lee (Martin  Sheen) and Longstreet (Tom Beringer) are examined - Lee's firm (though, in  this case, flawed) generalship, and Longstreet's internal struggle between  doing his duty or following an order that might (and did) cost hundreds of  lives.\nThroughout the film, other noteworthy performances are to be found  as well.  Sam Elliot is inspiring as General Buford, Union hero of the  first day of battle.  Sergeant ""Buster"" Kilain, played by Kevin  Conway, well demonstrates the sort of ""ordinary courage"" that  many people today (myself included) find so extraordinary.\nBut perhaps  the single best performance in the film is that of the late Richard Jordan  in the role of Confederate General Lewis Armistead - his last film role.  The story of Armistead and his friend, Union General Hancock, is the entire  Civil War writ small - brother against brother, friend against friend.  Armistead's filial affection for Hancock is examined, and his courage under  fire and inspiring leadership show well during the scenes of Pickett's  Charge.\nMost interestingly, none of the characters comes off as a *bad*  person - everyone is a good guy, everyone is a sympathetic character.  Previous reviews notwithstanding, the men who fought the Civil War were  often deeply religious, and this is well portrayed [unlike so many films  these days which tend to mock people of faith (particularly Christians)].  To me, this goodness only heightens the tragedy of America's bloodiest  war.\nBut...\nThe movie isn't just about people, but events as well.  The  re-creations of the elements of the overall battle are superbly done,  thanks in no small part to the thousands of Civil War reenactors who  participated (gratis) in the making of this film.  The combat at Little  Round Top is accurate (within the bounds of filmmaking), but most  impressive was the entire Pickett's Charge sequence - thousands and  thousands of men walking the same ground as did those men who marched to  their fates in 1863; it nearly brought a tear to my eye to see it.\nThere are not enough superlatives to describe this film.  It is utterly  magnificent.\nThis was and is my favorite film.  Buy it.";Brilliant - simply brilliant

But the historical accuracy is excellent - I took exception to very  few things (Lee's meeting with Jeb Stuart, for example, which, by all  accounts, didn't happen the way it was portrayed). The battle scenes are  outstanding, the musical score is the most haunting I've ever heard, and  there were at least 4 or 5 Oscar-worthy performances, most notably Jeff  Daniels and the late Richard Jordan. The only real problem I had with the  whole thing was that it seemed as though the producers couldn't decide if  it should be a theater release or a T.V. mini-series. It started out with a  very brief theater run and then nothing until many months later when it  appeared as a mini-series on T.V. If it was going to end up as a  mini-series anyway, then the length wouldn't have mattered and they could  have done an even better, more complete job.

On Gettysburg's outcome depended the future  of the United (or dis-United) States.  Its outcome decided whether one  nation (the US), or two (the US and the CSA), would determine the course of  the next century.  Had the North lost, Great Britain and France (and,  perhaps, Germany) would have won. I'm no Ted Turner fan, but my hat's off  to him (in this instance).  Much pressure was put upon him to shorten the  movie, and he nobly resisted.  Result: a masterpiece which ranks with The  Ten Commandments, or The Greatest Story Ever Told. In this  ""enlightened"" (aka cynical) era, when it's difficult to imagine  laying down one's life for an idea, this faithful depiction of the  realities of combat (which only those who've heard a shot ""fired in  anger"" can truly appreciate) is much needed.\nOne piece of  advice...demand the director's cut in a DVD release.

There were too many wildly incongrous factors, some of them directly reflecting Ted Turner's politically correct agenda.\nIn the  opening sequence, for example, we see a Confederate sentry that must weigh  300 pounds if he's an ounce. C'mon. There was no such thing as a fat  Confederate infantryman. YOU try marching hundreds of miles over the course  of two years of warfare, fighting, eating wormy bacon and green corn, and  see how much weight YOU keep on.\nThe two characters sitting under a tree  just as the battle was beginning to unfold, discussing the human condition,  I found a bit hard to swallow. And an Irishman talking about tolerance for  other races or cultures? Gimme a break.

109;58.0;5.0;10.0;6351;Not until I watched Gettysburg on TNT the first time, was I even interested in the Civil War. After seeing this epic on television, I immediately ran out and purchased the video. Soon after that, I began  reading just about every book I could find on the battle, and discovered  that the filmakers did their homework on this one. What makes this film so  realistic, is that they shot on the actual battlefield or close by in many  cases, and used re-enactors for many of the battle scenes, not just a group  of extras dressed up for the parts. Although Martin Sheen overworks his  characterization of General Robert E. Lee, the others do an excellent job.  You actually find yourself feeling General Pickett and General Longstreet's  (played by Tom Berringer) pain and frustration when the battle begins to go  against the South. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was when  Ted Turner (the TNT mogal) placed himself in the movie as one of the  leaders of the Virginia contingent, and dies very badly when his time  comes. Other than that, you become mesmorized by the strategy that both  armies worked to win this campaign, and the actual battle footage is so  realistic, you wonder if any of the re-enactor soldiers playing in the  movie didn't get hurt (there's one scene where a cannon shot goes off right  in front of a group, and blows them back in to the ranks). Even my young  sons have watched this 2 or 3 times with me, and has got them to ask  questions about the war. If a movie can do that to kids that are usually  more interested in the lasted fad these days, then this is a keeper. You'll  find that even the least informed history fans, will discover that this  movie has a plot line that is easy to follow, and will keep your interest  throughout the length of the film. Also, get your hands on the soundtrack,  as its quite enjoyable to listen to.;A Change Of Heart

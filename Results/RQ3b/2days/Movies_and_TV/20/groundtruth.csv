0;1.0;5.0;12.0;0;"In the Nineties it was fashionable for Hollywood to adapt popular television series for the big screen the best being ""The Fugitive"" and the very worst, in my mind, ""Lost In Space"".  There were high hopes riding on ""The Avengers"" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited ""The Avengers"" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.  It's rare that I do a 180 on a film but that's the case here.  This film may have its detractors but if you go into it with an open mind you may find delight in ""The Avengers"".";Time Is The Great Avenger
1;9.0;5.0;5.0;1059;"The cable movie rating was ONE STAR, but the names were fabulous. So I watched it. It may be the worst movie ever made, by the rating, but it is CERTAINLY one of the MOST ENJOYABLE ever seen.  It took a little research to discover that this was made after the successful TV series -- and then it dawned on me that they got the one star on purpose.  This is a fantastic ""send-up to the extreme"" of all the earlier ""spy movies"" and when watched with that in mind it was very enjoyable.  A must now for my collection.";They did it on purpose
2;8.0;5.0;9.0;1438;"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:\n\n1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).\n\n2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.\n\n3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).\n\nThis DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 4"" color-coded RED), is the fourth of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.\n\nPatrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.\n\nStarting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.\n\nEach of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.\n\nIn the 1968 Set No. 4 (which includes Vols. 7 and 8), we're talking about seven very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:\n\nVolume 7:\n\n""Wish You Were Here"" - In a parody of ""The Prisoner"" Tara attempts to free her uncle from a hotel which has a firm ""no check-out early"" policy. This is a superb episode.\n\n""Stay Tuned"" - Investigating Steed's amnesia (a returning theme from previous years), Steed and Tara uncover a plot to kill their boss, ""Mother"".\n\n""Take Me To Your Leader"" - A briefcase stuffed with money and a bomb seems to have a mind of its own - and it's giving strange orders.\n\nVolume 8:\n\n""Fog"" - When foreign committee members arrive in London for a meeting, they find themselves stalked by the ""Gaslight Ghoul,"" a Victorian killer with a modern motive.\n\n""Homicide and Old Lace"" - On his birthday, Mother tells tales of an older adventure. The flashback scenes were originally filmed for the never-aired episode, ""The Great Britain Crime"".\n\n""Love All"" - The missile department is leaking secrets but Steed and Tara sniff out the source of the indiscretion. A terrific episode.\n\n""Get-A-Way"" - A prison is having trouble holding enemy agents. The first two escapees knock off Steed's pals... is he the next on the list?\n\nThe storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.\n\nThe casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.\n\nI'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!";More of beautiful Linda Thorson! Details...
3;10.0;1.0;7.0;2281;Even though we approached this movie with the attitude that it had the same title and characters as a series that we enjoyed, but that it would most likely be different from the series, we were seriously disappointed. The movie stinks. 'Steed' is not comfortable with his umbrella or his bowler hat, and 'Mrs. Peel' is channelling 'poison ivy' from the Batman film. The plot is threadbare, the acting is woeful. Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.\n\nRent it if you have to watch it, it's not worth buying. Better yet, buy one of the box sets of the original series. Even on her worst days, Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel is far sexier and wittier than Uma Thurman's attempt, and Patrick Macnee's wit and dry humour has to be seen to be believed.;Not even close
4;2.0;1.0;23.0;2369;Let me just say that I love all the Avengers from Mrs. Gale to Tara King (for the most part) and I do love the actors of The Avengers movie but this movie stinks. It has nothing to do with the original show. First off Mrs. Peel never dealt with Mother. Mrs. Peel also did not have an on screen affair with Steed either. But Hollywood got it's paws on the story and ruined it. If your a fan of the show then you will hate this movie. I even tried to watch it a second time and just turned it off. This after Wal Mart had it for $5.00 on a discount rack. I should have been free.\n\nNothing in this movie blends with the real show. Nothing! I only wish that the real Avengers fans had a say with the script before they drove the image in the ground. I bet the script writer never really watched the show in the first place.\n\nStick with the original Avengers of the 60's. It can never be replicated. At least not in this movie.;Not even 1 star.
5;3.0;1.0;19.0;2493;Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......\n\nOn the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.\n\nIn its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.\n\nThe basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.\n\nAfter the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.\n\nA perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.\n\nThere's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.\n\nI read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.\n\nThe acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.\n\nThe film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.\n\nSpecial effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).\n\nI'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.\n\n(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)\n\nThe Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language.;Terrible in every way.
6;11.0;5.0;7.0;2547;Each of Steed's ladies made their own mark.  Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale, set the pace.  Sleek sassy women, who were as smart as they were sexy.  They held their own in a man's world and didn't need someone to take care of them.  Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time.  Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns.  Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.\n\nRigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame.  She is as popular today, if not more so.  So when she left--to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl, Steed had to have another partner.  Enter Tara King.  She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for.  They tried to play on her more feminine side (and with horrid fashions).  Seriously, the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting.  For the most part, they couldn't design more dumpy look clothes.  They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one, she was fighting an uphill battle.  Also, the scripts were not as sharp.  Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.\n\nEpisodes include:\n\nWish You Were Here\n\nStay Tuned\n\nTake Me to Your Leader\n\nFog\n\nHomocide and Old Lace\n\nLove All\n\nGet-A-Way;final series of Tara's run

I went in with an open mind, knowing that Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg will always be John Steed and Emma Peel.  I thought the addition of Sean Connery as the villain would be a delight.  WRONG.  The tv shows' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes, but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness.  Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.  I did like the mechanical bees sequence; the only true original touch in the movie.  The teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked, but since the whole movie was such a drag, I'm not sure anything could save it.  Macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role.  Too bad Uma didn't back out and get replaced by a more lively Mrs. Peel.";TV OR NOT TV

You won't ever see a duo as well suited to each other as Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg but give the current duo their propers! This a 1998 feature film version of a '60s British TV series, not a retrospective! It has the same over-the-top technology spin that the original producers would have incorporated in a heart beat, updated for the late '90s. If you paid attention to the original series it had the same eccentric characters and the same outlandish plots. That's what made the series and this film fun to watch. P.S., I could have gone for Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs. Peel.";Classic Camp in a  '90s Film
9;5.0;1.0;18.0;2960;To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.\n\nWhen Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.\n\nTo John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.\n\nThe Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.\n\nSo that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.\n\nThe casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.\n\nThere are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass.;Great TV Show, Lousy Movie

I have never walked out on any movie, much to my dismay.  I should have left during this one.  In fact, I remember at least 4 people leaving the theater, never to return.  One scene, in particular, haunts me to this very day.  There is a complex conspiracy afoot, and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold.

11;4.0;1.0;21.0;3126;"I loved the original Avengers series. It was a near flawless program; at least until Diana Rigg left.  This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.\nThis is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film.

13;17.0;5.0;5.0;3636;"""I thought you lived on the edge Mrs. Peel. Is this as fast as you can go?""\n\nI much preferred this movie to most of the James Bond movies. For one, the wit is wicked, Uma Thurman (Mrs. Peel) was born to wear a catsuit and Ralph Fiennes is a most dapper John Steed. This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.\n\nWhile drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:\n\n""After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.""\n\nThen, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.\n\nSo, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter. He plans to threaten the world with his fantastic high-tech weather machine. He is capable of threatening mankind with raging ice storms, scorching temperatures and mechanical insects. The special effects in regards to the weather are seamless and spectacular.\n\nThe script is delicious, the chemistry drips over the edge of the mind into a pool of absolute surging tension and visually, The Avengers is very compelling. You will love the fencing scenes, intelligent script, British humor and tongue in cheek capers.\n\n~The Rebecca Review";Good Fun, Really
14;13.0;1.0;6.0;3734;"I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.\nI am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this ""film"" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.\nWhat makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).\nThe film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.\nDo yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better.";UGH!
15;18.0;2.0;5.0;4033;"The rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the TV show. The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good ""Avengers"" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.\nRegarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.\nStick with the TV Show.";The story of what happened to this film
16;19.0;4.0;5.0;4133;The whimsical spirit of the classic TV series is retained in this unbelievably poorly treated adventure film. The studio hacked away about a half-hour's worth of footage after a bad test screening, meaning some may find the plot hard to follow, but all the stuff you need to know is there if you pay attention. Basically, it's the traditional spy story- our heroes battle a diabolical madman with an elaborate scheme for world domination- overlaid with some of the most imaginative, inventive and downright charming imagery seen in any action film. You've got gun-toting grannies, killer teddy bears, robotic bees, Escheresque mazes and all other kinds of hallucinogenic imagery, as suave superagents John Steed and Emma Peel try to foil Sir August De Wynter's plot to control the world's weather. Throw in a Mrs. Peel clone and a traitor in the agents' midst, and you've got a dreamlike narrative that proceeds to a wonderfully tempestuous climax. Fiennes and Thurman are no Macnee and Rigg, but they've got their own appeal and a nicely tender chemistry. Sean Connery as the bad guy appropriately hams it up, and there's a superb supporting cast. The visuals are wonderful (avoiding the phoniness of some attempted camp-fests like BATMAN AND ROBIN), the characters fun, and the overall effect is quite exhilirating. Highly recommended.;A Most Underrated Little Film
17;16.0;5.0;6.0;4432;"I loved this silly little movie. The people who didn't most likly didn't watch or didn't like the T.V. show. Come on people this movie was supposed to be silly, I'm not sure if the T.V. show was or not (but it was anyway).  Don't get me wrong I loved the show just a well and at times better than  this movie. I did think the ""Mother""/""Father"" stuff  went a bit far, even that wasn't that bad. It was nice to see (or rather  not see) Patrick Macnee (the orignal John Steed) as an invisible man. Where  was Diana Rigg. I would highly recommend this silly little movie to anyone.\nENJOY!";Why does the rating not go more than 5 stars?
18;20.0;1.0;5.0;4673;I loved the TV show.  The surreal situations, the action, but mostly the clever banter between Peel and Steed.  And it is mostly for lack of the latter, that this film doesn't work.  Where there should be lightning quick  exchanges there are holes in the repartee you can drive a Mack Truck  through.\nUma Thurman was a poor choice to play Emma Peel.  Her English  accent sounds awkward and contrived.  Often she accents the wrong word  within a phrase giving the impression that 1) she doesn't understand the  meaning of the lines she's delivering 2) she's reading her lines from cue  cards.\nLet's face it, big budget production values aside, without the  Peel/Steed repartee and chemistry there was no point in making this  movie.\nSpend your money wisely.  Buy the videos of the TV show instead.;Use your time more constructively -- view something else!
19;7.0;3.0;18.0;5024;I approached The Avengers with some trepidation, courtesy of several negative reviews, including one Australian critic who proclaimed it the worst movie he had ever seen. Having been one of just 42 people in the  cinema when I saw the film, I was wondering just how bad it was going to  be. My fears were unfounded. It was entertaining, amusing and suitably  peculiar. I say suitably peculiar as, being a fan of the 60's TV series,  any deviation from the concept would have been totally unsatisfactory. The  movie, set in the sixties, was not a nostalgia trip (something which would  have been a distraction) but still managed to capture the essence of that  period. The plot was as silly as any in the TV series, thank goodness, and  the villain (Sean Connery) was appropriately unbelievable. It wasn't one of  Connery's best performances but he obviously enjoyed hamming it up  outrageously. You have to enjoy it for that alone. Don't fall into the trap  of comparing Uma Thurman and Ralph Feines with Diana Rigg and Patrick  Macnee. They play their parts differently, not better or worse, just  different. The comparison is irrelevant. The cinematography is excellent,  as are the special effects. Overall, a highly enjoyable film that should  appeal to fans of the genre, and Avengers fan specifically. Not a great  movie, but a good production. Its lack of success is unfortunate, and the  bad press overdone. It's likely to attain some degree of cult status within  a couple of years.;Bordering on excellent

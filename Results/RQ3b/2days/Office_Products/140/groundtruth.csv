0;6.0;3.0;6.0;0;These pencils perform fine.  The color lays on well for a single layer of color and dissolves reasonably when water applied.  Though some pencil marks remain.  I like that it is meant to be permanent in the sense that a new layer of color should not disturb the previous layer once the first dries.  However layering a new layer of color on an existing activated area (colored with pencil then added water) doesnt work well.  The new layer of color doesnt stick to the old layer as well as it does to plain paper.  The biggest beef I have is with the color indexing.  The color at the end of the pencil is not like the actual color of the pencil.  For example the oak color has an olive green indication on the end of the pencil but the color is actually brown when you apply it to paper.  I mean why cant Derwent fix this?  Its really annoying as you cant trust the color you see on the end of the pencil you have to use a sheet of paper and create your own color chart.  For a set of pencils at this price point I expect better.\n\nI attached some swatches I made and also a comparison between inktense and watercolor.  Inktense can be used for painterly effects, but watercolor does a much better job if this is effect you want.  Inktense does give you greater control of the application but watercolor looks more interesting and less flat.;Color indexing on pencil is terrible
1;25.0;1.0;5.0;10;I haven't even had a chance to use the pencils yet. This review, for the moment at least, is about the box.\n\nAfter going back and forth for a month on whether or not it was worth it to order the set with the nice box, I finally went for. It arrived today, and even though its a Christmas gift and Im not supposed to use them until then, I decided to check the contents to ensure nothing was damaged. Im so happy I did. The kid of the box is bowed in the center, as if it warped or something. Which means there are huge gaps showing around the edges of the box. After closely examining the box, I realized that the whole box is warped or twisted, it doesnt sit flat on my desk but rather it bobbles back and forth. Not exactly what I was expecting from a company with typically high standards of quality.\n\nIm so crazy disappointed, and now I have to figure out a way to get a return label (I have no printer) and find a way and time to return this or if I can manage to fix it.  I was just so looking forward to these pencils and their supposedly elegant box.;Box is warped/twisted
2;21.0;3.0;18.0;85;"(WARNING- This is an in-depth review.  I am writing this for people who really want to know details about these pencils.  If you prefer a shorter summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE)\n---------------\nI am torn on how to rate these pencils.  As a watercolor pencil, they are bright and intense and are nicely colored.  As a permanent ink pencil that stays put once it has been activated with water and dried, well that is another story.  Because that is how I purchased these, I am rating them based upon that premise, since that is what makes these pencils unique, according to their description.\n\nWHAT IS THIS SET OF PENCILS LIKE?\nThis is the entire set of Inktense pencils.  I have spoken with someone who knows the art field in ways few do, and I was told that Derwent was re-formulating the Inktense line of pencils.  I think I know why.  More on that later.\n\nThis set of pencils comes in a tin box which has a nice cover on it.  It does snap into place, but there is no hinge.  The inside has two rather flimsy trays where each pencil rests.  You have to remove the top tray to get to the pencils below.  Mine came arranged by color which was nice.  There were no colors missing and no doubles either.\n\nWHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE PENCILS LIKE?\nI know that there has been some question about the quality of the pencils in this listing, but in my case, the pencils were good quality.  One has a split in it, but for the most part, they were fine an all tips were ready to use.  They came shrink wrapped and in brand new condition.\n\nHOW DO THESE PENCILS PERFORM?\nNow here is where the problems start.  First of all, there are many different surfaces to use watercolor media on, but in this case, the ink takes it to another level, supposedly.  The box advertises that these pencils can be laid down, and once laid down, they can be activated with water and moved around the surface.  Once they dry, they are supposed to be PERMANENT and not move around or muddy when you paint over them.\n\nI have tested every single color of these pencils.  I have swatched them and drawn them out to a very slight wash.  I left them in place for a WEEK without touching them.  When I went over them gently with a plain water brush (not sopping, just wet enough) I was very disappointed to find that they smeared as badly as watercolor pencils do.  This was on high quality watercolor paper without a heavy layer of gelatin on it.\n\nThis is not supposed to be the way that these work.  I was very disappointed.  As watercolor pencils, these perform as expected, but that is not how they are advertised as working.\n\nHaving said that, I will say that there are different surfaces that I am going to try these on.  I plan to use them on silk, scratchboard, and experiment with other porous surfaces to see how these behave.  On high grade watercolor paper, they are not permanent once activated, even if they were drawn out to a light wash.  That is disappointing.\n\nSTORAGE\nI wanted to mention here that I moved these to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soucolor-120-Slots-PU-Leather-Pencil-Case-with-Zipper-Rose-Red/dp/B01NBIACEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soucolor 120-Slots PU Leather Pencil Case with Zipper, Rose Red</a>&nbsp;in which they fit perfectly.  These pencils tend to be a bit fatter than other watercolor pencils, so I wanted to point that out in case that was a concern.\n\nWHAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER DOING\nI highly suggest that you get a watercolor paper spiral bound pad (does not have to be huge) to keep swatches in if you have not already.  These pencils look very different in lead, when they are put down on paper, and then when you add water to them.\n\nOn this pad, choose a page to put your Inktense swatches on and make small rectangular swatches.  Start from very intense to the left, and then lighter to the right- leave room to draw the out with water to the right.\n\nOnce you have labeled the color swatch with a technical pen (permanent) then you take a little water brush or water in a regular brush and draw the pencil out to the right, making sure to draw it out to a very light wash.  Let these swatches dry.  Then when you want to use these pencils, you can refer to your chart and know EXACTLY how these will look once activated with water, in various intensities.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nThese are advertised as being permanent once activated with water and dried- so much that you can paint over them without smearing.  That was not my experience.  The colors are bright and have a distinct texture to them- much brighter than many swatches online appear.  If used as watercolor pencils, they are fine, but if you are depending on them not to smear, I would caution you about these.  I have only used them on watercolor paper of high quality which did tend to brighten the colors.  Regular thinner mixed media paper dulled them down a bit.  I plan to test them on other surfaces like silk or scratchboard to see their permanence.  It is possible that other porous surfaces might give me better results.\n\nMY RATING\nThese have THREE stars, only based upon their failure to stay put on watercolor and mixed media paper.  I will test them further on silk and scratchboard and update this review should I find a difference in performance.  As I said at the beginning, someone who is very familiar with art companies and what is going on  told me that they are reformulating the Inktense pencils.  I am not sure if the reason is the smearing as I experienced or not.";GREAT Idea, Bright Colors, CAUTION If You Plan To Use These On Watercolor Paper

4;31.0;1.0;12.0;117;My much anticipated package arrived ahead of schedule and my review is actually about the beautiful tin that holds the pencils rather than the pencils themselves.\nThe tin lid is sratched up and I am really disappointed and wish quality control had of picked this up and swapped it out.\nIt cost me over $50.00 of hard earned money and if I had been choosing my own pencil set in a store myself, I most definitely would not have chosen this one.;Not suitable for a gift
5;63.0;4.0;5.0;122;Love these pencils, only issue had to get a replacement set as mine had a duplicate which means missing a color and one of the pencils casing was clearly cracked and they still coated the pencil and put it in the set, however the new set is good and I do love them. Amazon replaced them super quick attaching a pic of my fist drawing using them.;love them but need better quality control
6;72.0;5.0;5.0;179;I'm so happy that my hubby got these for me for my birthday! I started using these when I became bedridden and couldn't do the metal work that I loved. I taught myself how to draw instead and I've fallen in love with these since. I have always wanted the full set and losing my old, smaller set when we moved gave me the opportunity to do so. The price was also amazing, so much cheaper than going to our local art supply store.;By far the best colored pencil you'll ever use!
7;16.0;5.0;33.0;239;I own the inktense blocks and got these because I didn't like the idea of whittling sharp points on my blocks. I thought I wouldn't need the whole set, I would just use a few here and there. When I got them I decided to use them on their own and regretted not getting the whole set. For the most part they are really smooth, I can lay them on the paper with the lightest touch. I only had troubles with both yellows in the 36 set, they were a bit stiff. It could be my perception, they are bright so it took quite a few layers to actually see them and when I washed over them they were intense, I was able to make a large wash before I ran out of ink.\n\nThese are defiantly intense, a little bit of these go a long way. I don't think I will ever be able to use up even one. I got through my first test painting without needing to sharpen any.\n\nI have attached a test run I did with just the inktense pencils. I used three colors, Bark (a warm black, has a 'purple' look), Sun Yellow and Shiraz (a cool, almost alizarin red). This set has a very bright orange that didn't work for this project, so I mixed my own. I laid yellow down first and went over it with shiraz. I used a water brush to mix them on the paper and they made a nice dark orange. It worked out okay but mixing on a palette with paint or the inktense blocks is more controlled option. Shiraz has a low tinting strength, I almost accidentally washed away my orange and was stressed at the idea of a second attempt.\n\nI do think these pencils have a slight chalky look to them. I am willing to live with the chalky look, it isn't that noticeable and will probably be diminished when I find the right paper. I used my 'sketch' Canson XL pad which doesn't bring out the best color in paint but it's nice solid paper.\n\nHere are some tips for using these (any water soluble pencil really) successfully:\n1. Use a water brush or a stiff scrubber type brush, not a soft sable\n2. Do swatches first\n3. Find the low tinters and high tinters so you can get your mixes right.\n\nThat's it and good luck.;My only regret is not buying the 72 set
8;41.0;5.0;13.0;260;I have bought three sets so far, one for myself and two gifts. I use a Ranger heat tool to dry before adding more color. I like that I can get bold or light color, and it is easy to get highlights. I have used on regular cardstock (make sure the paper does not pill) and watercolor paper.;Love these pencils!!!
9;73.0;5.0;6.0;265;These Inktense pencils arrived in the just a few hours ago. Did a test drawing since I never used a water resolvable pencil or drawn an apple before. Wow! It is so pretty I freaked myself out!;Wow!
10;68.0;5.0;8.0;376;I love these pencils so much, I bought the larger set and gave this set to my sister-in-law! They're soft and color on so smooth, then comes the wetting... the color pops! They're beautiful and so great to blend different colors and layer colors.  The colors are super vivid. They have bit of a learning curve for blending, it takes a little getting use to the amount of time you have to move it around before it is permanent. Once these dry, they don't move! That's really awesome when you are layering colors, not so great if you want to change it as it dries. It doesn't take long to get a feel for them though and you be cruising with these amazing colors! I tell everyone they have to try them, I love them!;These Rock!
11;91.0;5.0;5.0;396;"I debated about purchasing these pencils versus prismacolor or some of the other popular brands, and I was not disappointed! I do stamping and cardmaking, so I used these with VersaFine black ink, as well as with the Memories brand white pigment ink called ""unicorn"".  These have really beautiful pigment, and they look nice with or without the addition of water. I haven't used them with mineral spirits as some people do to blend colored pencils, because all you need with these are water. The white pencil helps to soften and blend the colors, and I've gotten some really beautiful effects with these so far.";Great color!
12;55.0;5.0;11.0;402;These colors are definitely 'intense.'  I love the color choices and the freedom using pencils allows.  They are not watercolor pencils, though, but ink.  They also can be used in a watercolor painting to add dimension, shadow and depth.  Love them!;"Truly ""Intense"""
13;42.0;5.0;16.0;407;These pencils are phenomenal! Wonderful, rich pigment when water is added. I am looking forward to using them in my adult coloring books. I have included a picture of all the colors in the 72 set. The wide range of blues and greens are appreciated for coloring landscapes. Definitely a good decision to buy the 72 set!;Amazing pencils!
14;76.0;2.0;7.0;414;On the 72 box: Pencil #2400 -Outliner- is missing, instead pencil #2100 -Charcoal grey- came double. Picture attached;1 oencil missing, one double
15;10.0;5.0;62.0;425;I am so pleased with these pencils! It takes a little while to get the hang of them but once you do, they are amazing! The ink dries permanently and doesn't go through the pages of my adult coloring books! They arrived perfectly also. I wish there were more greens in this set, but I can buy them in open stock. Attached is the first picture I colored with them. I followed along with a youtube video.;Awesome pencils
16;54.0;4.0;12.0;459;These are a really cool product. They can be used in a variety of ways:\n-Draw and shade as you would with a pencil, and then activate the ink with water\n-Wet the paper, and then draw (this creates a very bold effect)\n-Go back and forth between drawing/shading and painting (the dry ink essentially becomes a paint as soon as the water touches it).\nI like to use these along with the inktense blocks, using the pencils for fine detail. The image of the man with the bicycle was completed using the inktense pencils only, and the building faade was completed with both the blocks and the pencils.\n\nI can not find documentation about these products being archival or their lightfast ratings, which leads me to believe that they are not. Therefore, I hesitate to give the product five stars.;Very cool product
17;94.0;3.0;5.0;468;"There are lots of colors but there aren't any vibrant colors. And, it is a ""softer"" lead so it doesn't keep the sharp tip, which is sometimes needed for some of the small, narrow spaces. It can be a little difficult to remove them from the nice storage tray and it does take up more room when on a table, so I have moved them to a circular container.";No Vibrant colors
18;49.0;5.0;14.0;496;"I remember wanting watercolor pencils since I was very little but my mom never really saw use for them hahah especially because they were so much more expensive then regular colored pencils!\nAnd then I forgot about them! Until now!\nI'm not an artist or anything so I didn't want to spend too much money on them just so I can play around! I looked them up here for a day or 2 and I have to tell you! I was quite upset that most reviews on a lot of different brands were ""paid"" reviewers. You know??? People get discounts or free products in exchange of a ""unbiased"", ""honest"" review.\nTo tell you the truth I have no issues with that, but when over 90% of the reviews are paid, and a brand I never heard of has only 4 or 5 stars.... Come on! When was the last time you've seen ANY product having all 4 and 5 stars?\n\nI don't know! I found it very suspicious. And annoying that most of the cheaper brands were all like that. So... I decided to bite he bullet and invest a bit more! I googled ""best watercolor pencils in a budget"". Derwent was a constant name on all lists and specially their Inktense line.\n\nI was hoping to get all the colors lol like 72 at least! But I compromised. A better brand (more expensive) and less colors (so I don't end up paying over $50 bucks on pencils lol)\n\nI am SO HAPPY I DID!\n\nThese pencils are amazing!!!!!\nThey have very intense color even before you apply water! The led is soft and feels like butter to color with! I didn't need any special paper to get a good result. On the contrary. As you can see in the pictures I tested them on a regular (square) notebook!\nThe pencil strokes disappear completely as you brush water on it and sooooo intense! Like the name says right?!? lol\n\nI was did not get anything free, neither did I get a discount! So believe me! This IS my unbiased and honest review! THESE ARE AWESOME!!!!\n(Note that the first swatch picture has no water, the second one is after I applied water with a brush - not included)";So intense! Highly recommend.
19;95.0;1.0;5.0;497;Very disappointing for this brand.  The colors were so dark it was hard to tell what color you were looking at.  I was expecting bright, highly pigmented colors to use as accents for paler colors.;Very disappointing for this brand. The colors were so ...
20;96.0;5.0;5.0;502;I picked these up because they were on sale and didn't research them at all before purchasing. While I was waiting for them to arrive in my house, I looked them up. Apparently, they are not a water color pencil, but an ink pencil and so once the layer dries after you use water to blend and move around the color, it is done and doesn't move around when you wet it again. So, with that info, I just went and drew my first drawing as soon as I got them. I will definitely buy the art blocks ASAP so I can do even more art!!! I was so pleasantly surprised with these pencils.;I picked these up because they were on sale and ...
21;98.0;5.0;5.0;505;Got these from Amazon Prime Day for a good deal! Love how intense the colors are. One touch with a damp brush and the solid colors melt. One thing I've found is that it works better on paper that isn't so rough. And you shouldn't drag the pencils on the paper with a heavy hand. A light touch will do. The color tends to get caught in the texture of heavy watercolor paper, and it takes a bit of digging with a wet brush to get the gritty texture to smooth out. For the attached swatch, I had to flip my watercolor paper over to work on the smoother side. Even then, you can see some grain left over. I think these pencils will work very well with smooth, watercolor-friendly paper like Midori Traveler's Notebook and Hobonichi Techo!;Beautiful range of intense colors!
22;1.0;5.0;463.0;516;So, let me preface this review by saying I am NOT an artist (by any stretch of the imagination) and I have never written an Amazon review. My creative credentials are comprised of a lifelong habit of picking up a 1,000 different hobbies, all of which I am OK at, but none of which I have ever mastered. Artistic ADD, in a manner of speaking (no insult intended to those suffering from real ADD). I am, however, afflicted with perfectionism and a very analytical mind, which is likely why I have never become truly proficient at any art form. If the result of my efforts doesnt look good enough to me, Ill keep trying for a while, maybe take a lesson or two, get sorta good, get bored with my lack of fast progress, move on to something new, and stick the supplies/equipment/fabric/whatever in a closet to collect dust for the next decade. I think I'm gonna need a bigger house. (But, give me a massive spreadsheet and Ill make magic happen!!)\n\nI just picked up my first adult coloring book as a stress reducer/time waster that would have some sort of product to account for my (wasted) time. I can DO coloring, I just cant draw anything that even remotely resembles the target object. I have now colored a sum total of TWO pages. The first was colored with Crayola colored pencils, which were cheap...and fine, but not very vivid, not all that blendable, and with not enough color variations to be really fun (the primary goal of this new hobby). I started the second page with some decades old colored pens missing half the pens (of course, the best colors were all dried up) and some of the Crayola pencils. At that point, I started a quest for better colored pencils. Almost all of the pencil reviews had the highest praise (vivid colors, good coverage) as well as the lowest praise (leads constantly breaking, leads off-centered, impossible to sharpen, etc.). After several days of near analysis paralysis, I finally settled on the Derwent Inktense collection of 72 pencils.\n\nI was so excited I could barely stand the long wait for the package to arrive (a whole, like, five hours with Amazon Prime). I broke those puppies out long after my bed time and completed two or three flowers on my otherwise pretty dull 2nd coloring page. First impression? Well, not titillated, to be sure. Thought it might be the light, my old tired eyes, or maybe the wine....(no, not the wine...ok, maybe the wine). So, let's wait until morning. It was five minutes into my new day fresh perspective before I started drafting my first negative Amazon review in my head. The color was super waxy with spotty coverage, even with a heavy hand. Honestly, they felt like kindergarten crayons in a pencil barrel. For $70+ bucks??? Really??? The lead stood up to the pressure, which was a plus, but you could still see the white of the page under the ink. The pencil would not stay sharp for the fine lines and small spaces. Most colored pencils, except perhaps really soft ones, sort of self-sharpen just by shifting the angle of the lead. Not these. The colors seemed really vivid and blending them was ok, but I was so disappointed that the color didn't spread evenly and smoothly on the page. It was very blotchy. I sat back and thought about all of the five star reviews and wondered what in the hell all these people were thinking. Were they ALL paid reviews? Then, out of nowhere, DING, DING, DINGI remembered reading that these are WATER color pencils.\n\nNot having any artist brushes whatsoever, I cleaned up a make-up brush (lol, yes, you heard right) to see what would happen to the ink from my crayon pencils when I added a bit of H20. It was a total freaking revelation. I am blown away. The color just jumped off the page. Blending was a dream, layering on different colors was a blast, and removing color was a miracle. Removing one color to lighten an area in order to add an (afterthought) brighter color was like too much to ask for. I AM SOLD. I have not colored in a coloring book since I was a child and I have never done a water color in my entire life. But, I may just spend the REST of my life using these pencils to make art that I will proudly hang on my refrigerator.\n\nIn terms of the pencil quality and packaging, there are 72 distinct colors, all with perfectly centered lead. They sharpen easily in a manual or electric sharpener. They do not erase easily (I imagine you cant really erase a real watercolor). The pencils are very professional looking and have both color names and numbers so that you could really wear the pencil down to a tiny nub and still know which color it is to replace it. They are in two trays in a tin box. The lid doesnt really fasten down on the tray, so you would have to carry and store it carefully or put a rubber band around it. Ive added a few photos of the pencils, the lead, and my second colored page. The light pink and purple flowers are a mix of my previous pens/pencils. The tiny bell flowers are from a new set of colored pens that arrived the same day. The rest is the Derwent Inktense after adding water. Please remember, I am not an artist, I am a total noob to adult coloring books (and, btw, can we not think of a different name for this hobby so it doesn't sound x-rated??), and I was using one old make-up brush that kept splitting into a TRIDENT shape (now eagerly awaiting the arrival of real water color brushes). Regardless of my skill level, or lack thereof, I think the colors are brilliant and my own imagination is the only thing that will limit what I can do with all these colors and combinations of colors. Hallelujah! Maybe, Ill stick with one hobby for a while (no guarantees!). Thank you to one of my last remaining brain cells for the reminder that these were actually water color pencils and to Derwent for creating this amazing product!;From Despair to Holy Awakening!
23;39.0;5.0;19.0;524;Wow! Love these! Very intense colors. I've used other watercolor pencils but these are the best. Will definitely be buying more colors. I do not care for a regular paint brush with these. Waterbrush works best for me. If you don't know what those are, I have attached a picture. For tiny spaces you can wet the pencil to color in. They are well worth trying.;Wow! Intense!
24;18.0;5.0;49.0;536;This was my second Inktense purchase and they are all that and a box of crackers! Seriously. Unlike watercolors, these pigments become permanent once they dry, which means you can layer your colors and achieve a vibrancy that just isn't possible with anything else I've tried. I use them in coloring books as well as in painting (I'm not an artist and this picture is my first painting ever. It's not finished, but this is where it's at now.) The pencils often work better than the blocks in coloring books because of the control allowed. Use a Furetake water pen to activate and you've got magic in there.;Art Medium Unlike Any Other...Perfect for Coloring Books
25;19.0;5.0;48.0;547;I am very new to coloring and using colored pencils.  I was actually eyeing the Prismacolor Premier set and ran across these during my search.  The thought of using these as pencils and then with a wet brush was appealing.  I did have to practice using these and watched several YouTube videos on using these properly and to their best advantage.  I was a little worried at first because I wasn't getting the effect I wanted.  But with a little practice, I now have a better feel for them.  I absolutely love these pencils!  After coloring with them as pencils, you add a lightly damp brush over the color and you get this amazingly intense rich color.  You have to be careful not to use too much water as it takes just a damp brush to get the effect.  I have also used these by just rubbing a damp brush on the tip and painting on my page.  These are great and I love using them.\n\nI almost took a star off because the set I got did have a duplicate pencil which meant I was missing one.  But after using these, I figured I would just go buy the missing pencil and keep the 5-star rating because I think these are amazing.\n\nThe attached picture was colored using these pencils and the Prismacolor Premiers.  The trees, land, and sky were all done with the Inktense pencils.  I tried to create the same type of tree with Prismacolors but couldn't so I really was excited to be able to do it with these. Of course there are several artists out there that could create it with regular pencils but sadly I am not an artist, just a mom who wanted to color with her daughter and use come really cool tools.;I love Inktense pencils!
26;38.0;5.0;21.0;569;After buying many of the Derwent products I own myself, I asked by my daughter what I would like for Mothers Day, I knew right away. I love, love , love all of the Derwent products. I make  many beautiful pieces of artwork with these products. My favorite right now though of all things are mixed media tee's for the grandchildren. Who knew there was one pencil that would do so much?;Perfect Mothers Day gift.
27;101.0;5.0;5.0;575;The brilliance and saturation you can get from these pencils is striking.  They also allow you to blend and make subtle gradients, which creates a much richer and more complex drawing than with regular pencils, even just standard water color pencils.  I would purchase as large a set as you can, so that you don't have to duplicate when you want more.  You can blend the 12 colors, but this can't achieve the wide variety of the larger sets.;Both nuanced and brilliant
28;8.0;5.0;128.0;581;The Derwent Inktense 36 pencil set arrived in perfect condition. Following some reviewers suggestions, I immediately marked the tray with the numbers and color names of each pencil in its slot, to keep them in order.\n\nNext I made charts to show each pencils strokes in both dry and wet samples (thanks for the tip, Mary Ingold).\nSome pencil points do not look like the color put on paper: Sherbet Lemon, Mustard, and Tan pencil points look green. Some dark pencil points, such as Sea Blue and Teal Green, are brilliant when wet. Charcoal Grey and Indian Ink are cooler than the warmer Ink Black.\n\nFor the charts, I cut out pages from a Pentalic hardbound Sketch Book, since the pages were white and smooth. The paper buckled, however, with the slightest addition of water. Using a Pentel Arts Aquash water brush, purchased on Amazon, I was careful to moisten rather than flood the pencil marks. The colors spread easily and smoothly. But use heavier paper than all-purpose sketchbooks for your artwork.\n\nThe black Outline pencil, which is not a watercolor pencil, won't be affected by the addition of water. However, it can smear when coloring with other dry pencil marks around it (see the ducks face in my picture). In small areas, it would be better to apply the color as a wash, rather than a dry pencil followed by a wet brush.\n\nWhile trying to photograph the pencils with the charts, I had trouble with the round barrels causing the pencils to roll on the slightest incline of the surface. Finally, I put them on the carpet, which held them in place. A small washcloth or piece of fabric could help to prevent rolling and dropping of pencils.\n\nThese pencils offer the best of both worlds - the control of drawing, and painting without any mess or waste.\nIll post my charts, although the colors may not be as brilliant in the photos, due to lighting.;Make A Color Chart
29;45.0;5.0;17.0;593;Some of my favorite colored pencils! They are so saturated with color! I use them all the time! I'm not a professional artist but these are AMAZING!;More than just your average colored pencil!
30;92.0;5.0;6.0;622;Honestly, 12 colors are all you need :)\n\nThey blend very well, so if you have experience in working with a limited palette already, this will be a breeze. I mixed both these and my watercolor palette colors to see if they would blend well and they did! In fact, I think these pencils are more vivid and truer to color once dried. I'm loving these and am thoroughly enjoying seeing what this can do for expanding my watercolords :);Honestly, 12 colors are all you need: ) ...
31;79.0;5.0;8.0;626;"I LOVE these! I got them for my daughter as a gift, but I decided to give them a try myself. Absolutely gorgeous colors and workability. They  work well on primed canvas. I would try them on a finer canvas for portraits though because the rougher canvas makes it difficult to detail properly. Making an under layer with washed acrylic would be best so that the white does not show through. Brush quality definitely matters too. I used cheap synthetic brushes and they only smear the ""ink"" around causing the texture to appear ""gunky"", especially after adding a few layers. High quality watercolor brushes would probably be a smarter choice. I did a few pieces with a combination of Copic markers and acrylics. When using on canvas, you have to be careful not to smear it around with too much water, and it's best to allow each layer to dry a bit before adding another. I have tried them on Arches cold and hot press papers and the colors are quite vivid. I am going to use them for Sumi ink drawings and watercolors on the Arches paper. Very nice product. These would make an excellent gift for those who love to use colored pencils and mixed mediums.";Excellent pencils, beautiful colors
32;106.0;2.0;5.0;638;Not for everyone. These take a lot of patience. If you lay down anything but the faintest layer, the pencil lines remain because the water absorbs too fast to fully dissolve all the pencil. This means a ton of layering. Some people love that. Not me.\nAlso, for such an old co. I don't know why they couldn't at least make the color coding on the ends match the actual color you get in the pencil. Many are off. You either need an incredible memory or you have to make a chart.\nThe trays are dark and the lead tips don't show up well.;Pricey disappointment
33;23.0;5.0;47.0;640;"I just love these. I've had them for three years now. I agonized over the price before buying my first set, but I have never regretted it. Eventually I even bought the set of 72 colors.  I'm attaching a picture I painted with them.  Here are a few things I've learned:\n\n1. THESE ARE REALLY FUN AND FREEING\nSince ordering my own, I have ordered many sets as gifts. These are perfect for people who want to get back into painting but don't have the time, and for people like me who fear making mistakes on a ""masterpiece."" These are just really fun, and so easy. But the intense, saturated colors can give near-professional results.\n\n2. SO SIMPLE, AND EASY SET-UP\nWith these pencils, some paper, and a simple water brush, you'll have everything you need. I take this on trips, and once I even painted a whole picture while sitting in a plastic chair at the airport. It's that easy, and not messy at all.\n\n3. USE WITH A WATER BRUSH\nYou can use the brush to take paint right off the pencil, and paint just like normal. Water brushes basically clean themselves, so you only need one, and they're cheap. I have this one, but there are a lot of others out there:\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pentel-Arts-Aquash-Fine-Point-Water-Brush-Large-FRHBBP/dp/B002LG0YSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pentel Arts Aquash Fine Point Water Brush, Large (FRHBBP)</a>\n\n4,.USE TO LAYER COLORS\nSince these are permanent if you wet them and then let the paint dry, every layer you put down will be set. You can layer to your heart's content with no muddy colors.\n\n5. BE AWARE THAT THESE ARE NOT ALWAYS LIGHTFAST\nSome of these colors are more lightfast than others (you can google it), but the lighter colors, yellows in particular, are not lightfast at all. The color will start fading pretty quickly. So take photos. : )\n\nThese are on a whole different level from any other watercolor pencils I have ever tried. I just wish they didn't fade. But I love them. They're really fun.";I just love these - here are some quick tips
34;36.0;5.0;23.0;664;Loving this beautiful coloring book for adults! The cover has a slipcover, both of which are able to be colored, and the slipcover may be colored inside and out! The pages are a very nice weight, although they are printed on both sides, and markers may bleed to the other side. The art is amazing and beautiful, and I may end up buying a second one to color differently, and yet a third to keep pristine and unmarked, just for the beauty of the drawings!;Beautiful coloring book for adults with lovely surprises...
35;86.0;5.0;7.0;701;I just love these ink pencils. The colors just blast off the page. Can't comment yet if they'll hold up in terms of fading over time...anyone else have a comment on that?  But right now, I have nothing but love for them.  I bought the small set first, then invested in this larger set. There are sets even bigger than this, but after awhile, it's hard to tell the colors apart, especially when you get into the blues and greens. The color indicator on top of each pencil doesn't do a very good job in letting you know what the color will look like on the page, so I had to make my own color chart and number the pencils myself to let me know what each pencil's color will look like on paper.  The pencils themselves are great, but improvements are needed in the color coding.;Gorgeous, but tough to tell colors apart
36;14.0;5.0;72.0;711;My very fist watercolor pencils!!  I'm not an art expert and I love them.  Got these for my adult coloring books.  Wish I had gotten the 72 piece set instead.  After using these, I found that I very much prefer watercolor pencils over the regular colored pencils.  So much easier on the hand and spreads color a lot better.;Perfect set for watercolor beginner
37;22.0;4.0;50.0;720;I bought these as an alternative to watercolor pencils. My first impression was that they were really creamy for this type of pencil. They were also highly pigmented and super vibrant.\n\nI then swatched all of them out and realized that one of them is actually an outliner pencil. So really you only get 23 colors.\n\nI did some opacity testing with them as well. On the top, I colored full strength and did not set the pencil. On the bottom it is the pencil, full strength with water on top. The bottom swatch started out the same size as the top, so you can see that they move around really well after water is applied to the pencil.\n\nI also did some permanency testing. I took some paint directly off the pencil lead with my brush and let it dry. I then took a wet brush to it and tried to move the color around. The teal and fuchsia did well. The tangerine and the sun yellow moved around a bit, but not nearly as much as the prismacolor watercolor pencils I use.\n\nThe only reason I docked a star is because of the included outliner pencil. I don't really outline, and if I do I use other pens. The price is also a little high. Amazon is the cheapest place I have found them, even compared to using a coupon at the big box craft stores.;Good pencils, a little pricey though.
38;97.0;5.0;6.0;723;I love these INK pencils! They are amazing in wet medium! Intense color, easy to use, and such a great add in to any watercolor piece I'm working on! They last forever, stay put pretty well once dry if I'm working on another section or layer on the same piece. I will buy these again when I run out! A great addition to any watercolor artist's arsenal! Even when diluted, they don't change in vividness... just get a bit lighter and more translucent!;The Ink is VERY Intense!
39;15.0;5.0;65.0;731;I absolutely love these. Being able to layer color, but still maintain a watercolor feel is wonderful. Make sure that you test the color before applying it to your page.\n\nThe only down side to the product is that its light fastness is affected directly by how much water is applied to the color. If you are a professional artist interested in selling any work done in Inktense I would recommend doing so as prints as it is likely some of the colors will fade over time.;Wonderful Color and I love the permanence
40;111.0;5.0;5.0;737;They work really good. I use them all the time.;Amazing
41;113.0;5.0;5.0;788;These are the most amazing pencils I've ever had. I'm not super-artistic. However I love card-making. A little goes a long way, when you add water. Very intense, bright colors. It's fun to mix them. I'm very glad I bought them. If I continue with this hobby, eventually I will get a larger pencil set. Highly recommend them for budding artists and craft-lovers!;These are the most amazing pencils I've ever had
42;74.0;5.0;10.0;801;To say these colors are vibrant is an understatement. Once wet they jump out of the paper at you. I found them easier to blend then my watercolor pencils. I use the Inktense for my card making on water color paper and I've also used them in my adult coloring books. They're fabulous, get them!;Love at first swatch!
43;44.0;5.0;20.0;814;I am really impressed with the quality of these pencils.  I have done a few sketches/paintings with them and the Derwent Inktense Blocks and\nthey are really easy and fun.  I found that I tend to outline and shade in smaller areas with the pencils, and use the blocks for\nshading in the larger areas.  Once I started to add water to my drawings, the colors popped.  I used these on a heavy multi purpose paper and also a small stretched canvas which I did not prep.  I think the canvas was a bit too bumpy to get the fine detail I wanted with the pencils, so I will go back to a smoother surface next time.  I learned that these are not really true watercolor pencils as once you wet your work, it cannot be washed off.  You can manipulate your strokes with a stiff brush while your work is still damp.  You can blend colors lifted with a wet brush onto a nonabsorbent palette. You can also layer colors on your painting.\nNow for the negatives:  I wish they had included a white pencil in with the basic set.  These are very expensive, but they should last a long time.\nI have also heard that work done with these pencils will fade with light and time.  I don't know what kind of spray would be safe to use to prevent this.\n I plan on taking these with me on my next vacation for some rainy day artwork.  I am enclosing a photo of the 8X10 inch canvas which I painted with these pencils and the Derwent Inktense Blocks.  I outlined the shapes with acrylic gel pens.  I do not recommend using canvas unless you can prep it in such a way that it is smooth.;Wonderful New Way To Paint
44;84.0;5.0;8.0;821;These pencils are wonderful! Love the intensity wet or dry.;Great to work with
45;9.0;4.0;94.0;832;I got this set after buying a couple from a local art store to try out. I use these to add more contrast to my drawings and work with the Albrecht Durer 120 watercolor pencil set.\n\nColor goes down smoothly and glides on pretty well. I noticed more flaking and a slight bit chalkier feel with these than the Albrecht Durer pencils. There was also a little bit of squeaking or slightly more noise when coloring with one of these. Overall nothing serious. Just me noticing the difference in materials. Used dry, these have good coverage. They have a slight grainy quality and prone to flaking a little.  I can blow away flakes, as they happen, to keep the paper clean. Blues, greens, browns and purples are really dark when used dry. All of them except perhaps the two black colors have quite a shift in lightness. Some colors look nearly black until wet. This could be a problem, but workable by making test color swatches and anticipating the effect when using them.\n\n- About the tin:  It's a bit wobbly and thin when lifted. Likely not anything I want to carry around without having a few rubber bands. If I need to transport the pencils, I'll select the ones I am using and carry them in another container. Or take them all out and put them back into the tin later. (I had a near spill until I did just that.)\n\nWhere this product shines the most for me is when wet. When wet, the ink yields a marker like effect or a thin acrylic wash. The Albrecht Durer pencils wet are more like watercolor paints. They have a gentle softness. These are more bold. It is fun using the two sets together. In time I hope to have the full range of colors, but this has quite a lot of the colors I was looking for and I got a good deal on it at the time I ordered.\n\nIncluded are the color examples used with and without water. The colors are in the order I found them in the tin.\n\n- Update:\nTo really get the most out of these for projects like adult coloring books try using an alcohol based maker blender or water brush filled with 91% rubbing alcohol or denatured alcohol instead of water.\n\nResult: Marker like smoothness, full richness of color with little to no page buckling.  So far I've even noticed much less bleed through, but it is always better to test this out first before committing to any given coloring book.;Bold marker/ ink like effect is handy- use an alcohol based marker blender instead of water  for paper and coloring books
46;33.0;5.0;29.0;851;Exactly as promised, what stunning pencils. Truly, do a test swatch of each color first, as these are INK pencils, and very different even from other Derwent watercolour pencils. I've had a tin of Derwent watercolour pencils all my life, which had been my brother's since at least some time in the 70's or 80's, and I've only recently started really learning to use them now that I'm more confident with the medium. These Inktense pencils are a great way to build on that confidence, as well as experiment in your own style. The color pigments are rich, bold, and once you've saturated the markings the ink glides very smoothly. Even though this set has no pastel colors at all, a pastel can be made by simply using the pencils very lightly and applying more water with your regular or water-holding brush. All in all, I'm very, very satisfied and have renewed my love for Derwent products. <3;These Inktense pencils are a great way to build on that confidence
47;103.0;5.0;6.0;854;"This is a wonderful set, and the wooden box is so beautiful; it makes it a pleasure to use.  The one thing I would change is the wooden bars that keep the pencils in place.  They're a little finicky.  I would rather just have them be on a hinge that opens and closes and is held in place with a magnet at the other end.  Aside from that, this set is stellar, and Inktense pencils are so much fun to play with.  I will never be without them in my arsenal of art supplies.  You can use them on paper or fabric, and the colors are rich and saturated.";Gorgeous presentation, wonderful pencils
48;85.0;5.0;8.0;855;These were great!  I wish I could afford more!  They worked well with other colored pencils, too.;Beautiful Colors
49;104.0;5.0;6.0;856;Rather magical.  Intense color but a soft enough tip for comfort.  With only six pencils I've been blending colors, mostly with good results.;The products that they didn't make when I was young.
50;57.0;5.0;16.0;874;I'm absolutely thrilled with these pencils. I got them for use on fabric but first practiced on card stock. The colors were more intense than I anticipated after seeing that some people said they were just a little more intense then regular watercolor pencils. You can make very sheer layering effects by saturating your brush with water, but with a damp brush, you get bright colors that don't move at all after they've dried. So you can do one area, brush it, let it dry, then do the next without worrying about pulling color from the section you did first. The colors blend well, but test first on scrap paper.\n\nI think I'll want a bigger set in the near future. Attached photos are a box I printed then colored using these pencils along with a blank version of the same box.;Fantastic- I love how well these work
51;118.0;5.0;5.0;894;I bought a small set to test to see if i liked them.  :) Score for Derwent!!!  (Can I get a discount on the next batch I buy) LOL Loved these :);great

Next time I will get faber castell polychromas;Opened package & tin had been dropped during delivery ( ...
53;46.0;4.0;21.0;917;I like the pencils but I found that these pencils you have to wet them first to get the colors to come out, they are NOT like any other pencils I worked with. I really love a charchol pencil that is number 6 B soft and comes out where I can see my work in. But with this product I find that this can not be seen that well, as far as the sharpening them be careful you do not sharpen too much you will lose most of the color they do work well when its not so pointy. I do also love the Intense blocks. when wet your colors come out amazing.. I use it mostly on silk. Dries fast and you can heat set the iron and no steaming, so you can use right away.. and its permananet.. this set and the Derwent Instense Blocks are very good for traveling. I travel alot so I need something that I do not need to use color dyes with that have easy access to do on the plane or at my destination but still have the control to play or draw whenever the mood sends me.;I like the pencils but I found that these pencils you ...
54;121.0;5.0;5.0;926;I LOVE these pencils! The color is intense and pure. They can be used dry or you can add water and turn them into an ink that is permanent when dry. They can be used on paper, cotton, all natural fibers. When they are used on fabric you need to activate them with water in order to make them permanent. You can color directly onto the surface, paper, t-shirt etc. and then add water with a brush, or you can apply a paintbrush with water to the tip of the pencil and then appy to the surface. I love to use them to color in stamped images or just to freedraw pictures. I find them more user friendly than copic markers for blending and adding permanent color to products, not to mention easier on your wallet.;I love these and often use in place of copics.
55;50.0;5.0;19.0;928;Treat my review as that of an extreme amateur. I purchased a box of 12 from a local craft store because I recently decided to explore learning to draw after 20 years of not even trying anything. The only drawing type thing I have done since high school is color in coloring books, and I'm pretty good at that (this is not saying much, I know that). I tend to prefer to color with pencils because of the control and blending factors.  So I thought for my experiments in drawing, it would be fun to try out this type of pencil/ink/water color blend.  I LOVE these pencils. They are so fun for me - an extreme amateur (so I'm saying I don't know much of anything). I'll even post my first two drawings ever in 20 years, which I did with a sketching pencil and then colored in and turned into a watercolor just using water and my fingertips. The bird drawing is from a photo of a friend's chick. I have since bought some brushes for more control.\n\nI am now obsessing about the gorgeous 72 color set in a wooden box. Six times the fun!;I LOVE these pencils
56;34.0;1.0;29.0;934;Really desapointed. The colors doesn't match with the Ones painted in the pencils. They are really different and darker. The wood is cheap. And ir came with 2 identical pencils.\nDon't waste your money;Don't waste your money
57;59.0;3.0;16.0;944;These were clearly factory fresh with plastic over the package and in an overwrap box.  I am very pleased with the product, the vividness of the  colors, and the ease of application (smoothness).  What I am not so thrilled  with is receiving duplicate colors.  Instead of Field Green, I received two Felt Green.  This is not enough for me to return the item so I will try and find a supplier who sells single pencils to complete the set,  Also, the trays are very flimsy.  I expected to be able to easily lift the tray with one hand.  The material is very thin plastic and if you do not handle with two hands, the pencils end up on the floor.;"Mixed Feeling the pencils are wonderful; however, I received a duplicate and the trays are too flexible"

60;108.0;5.0;6.0;987;"With these wonderful pencils I am an artist.  When water is applied, the color is so clear and vibrant.  I ordered the set of 22 colors..a good starting place for a beginner! First, I draw a sketch lightly in pencil.  Using a photograph provides a good reference.  Then use the pencil called ""outline"" to go over pencil lines.  It does not have the inktense  properties of other colors. Then apply color. I started with a mock-up of all colors with water applied which aided greatly in color selection. Then paint over and mix colors, if you wish, with water. So beautiful. These pencils (or to me, they seem like ink) carry the show. Really nice.";You must get Inktense pencils.  Like nothing you have used in past.
61;12.0;5.0;92.0;994;These are the best pencils I have ever owned.  The capability of either using the with a paintbrush and water, or a water spray bottle spritz activates the vivid tones.  I have attached a drawing I did with standard colored pencils, and again pretty much the same drawing with the  Inktense pencils.  This shows the difference.  I regret that I only bought 12 of the Intense pencils, and will be shopping at Amazon.com for more.;These are the best pencils I have ever owned
62;2.0;5.0;415.0;1000;These are wonderful and beautiful pencils. Make yourself a color chart (likes attached chart) as the colors that come out of these pencils are too vibrant and lovely to be adequately represented by a color guide suggestion on the back end of the pencil.;Love these!
63;52.0;1.0;19.0;1009;I'm very disappointed with this color pencils. I bought the the tin with 36 ink pencils in which 5 are variations of black. What the heck am I going to do with 5 variations of black? This is not necessary. There is lack of light blues, light red/pinks and greens and instead of pencil color this set comes with black colors.\nI would not recommend this to a friend and I'm not buying again this product.\nVery, very unhappy!;I'm very disappointed with this color pencils

It does exactly what it's supposed to do and looks great either dry or wet and a combination of the two if that's what you need for your art piece.";Great multi-use colored pencil for both dry and wet looks

However, these pencils are great quality and do the job well.";Not quite as intense as I was hoping
70;116.0;5.0;6.0;1206;I wanted to have these, because of how bright the colors are. I just didn't want to spend a ton on a very big set, because I already had a lot of water soluble pencils. At the end of the day, I use the most common colors anyway. This size box is perfect for my purpose.\nThe pencils are just great, they act like ink. The colors are very bright, they do not bleed after they blend. They can even be used without water. The harder you press, the brighter the colors. They have become one of my favorite mediums.;Very Bright!
71;105.0;5.0;7.0;1234;a little goes a long way. These are going to last me forever. I'm doing some urban sketching and these are great. They mix well and you don't have to use much at all to get great color. In fact, I just draw in parallel lines where I want color and space them apart for lighter color or space them closer for darker. Just experiment with them because you don't need to color the whole area you want to get it covered once you bring out the waterbrushes. I do recommend water brushes. The derwent  3 pack works great with this. The ink does stain them a bit, but it doesn't transfer. You can just squeeze a bit of water into the brush head and wipe it on your papertowel or cotton rag and it comes right out of the brush. Great purchase. I just wish they sold them individually because the colors in the 12 pack are not colors that I normally use.;I'm impressed and convinced they'll last a very long time.

75;81.0;4.0;11.0;1284;I really like these pencils but they could be improved.  They have VERY INTENSE colors as advertised.  They are excellent if they have the colors you want.  However, they lack a full range of colors.  They are short on the reds and pinks and generally the warm colors.  They do have a wonderful selection of cool and dark colors.  Also - the colors on the back end of the pencil do not match what you get when you use them on the page.  You have to make your own color chart or sketch them on a piece of scratch paper to see the actual color you will get.  They do have wonderful colors especially in the dark range.  They are a wonderful addition to a larger, more complete set of watercolor pencils.;Intense colors
76;120.0;5.0;6.0;1329;These watercolor pencils performed as advertised. The color is very intense. They also blend beautifully with each other. I have been an oil painter for over 40 years but lately I have been trying various water based media. I have been disappointed with the difficulty of blending, for example, a sunset sky with these media. I was able to use these pencils to make overlapping horizontal stripes from yellow to purple on Arches hot press board. I then blended them with a wet foam brush and achieved a sky that was outstanding and would rival any done in oils. I intend to order more of these pencils and hope that they offer additional colors.;Bright, intense colors
77;122.0;5.0;6.0;1348;I can't say enough about this product, they are well worth the money, not only can you use them in your art studio, you can also use them to paint fabric with, all you need is a fabric medium added to the pigment and the possibilities in your sewing room is endless as well!;Outstanding Product!
78;83.0;4.0;11.0;1406;I wanted something that was as vivid my colored pencil work without the sometimes visible line work that can show even when one used a blender. I also work in watercolor but wanted something that would be quick to set up for just quick sketches and washes of color. After seeing a instructional video on their website I decided to buy the 24 count inktense set. It was the most economical with a good selection of color choices.\n\nThe inktense pencils are wonderful! The pigment is strong and very easy to work with.  If you apply a lot of color and water you will have an inky wash that you can manipulate. I have been using them on mainly cold pressed 140lb paper to practice with these pencils. I am finding as I get used to their different qualities they really have a wide range if applications. I am blending the with my watercolor paints to give some serious contrast.\n\nAs for the downside the colors are quite bold and to me they have a almost cartoony flat appearance about them. This could be a bother for someone who prefers a more earthy/realistic palette. My inexperience with this medium and my limitations as an artist may also be to blame for their perceived color limitations. I found blending colors to be limited to one or two layers.\n\nI am extremely happy with my purchase and while I was tempted to get the 72 count the 24 was perfect.;Absolutely gorgeous
79;130.0;5.0;5.0;1417;Ohh baby! If you love saturated color and absolute control of where you put it these are for you. It's probably naughty how happy working with these and Inktense blocks makes me. The color is slightly waxy (?) when you apply it dry, not as creamy as Derwent watercolor pencils, but when you wet it and move it around, the ink is so vibrant and so versatile. It's also permanent when dry, so you can layer over it without affecting that layer. Great on fabric! Oh... and I got all 72 for $69.99, which is almost 2/3 off list price! I had them on my wishlist and the price dropped like, $40.00 or so. Thanks Amazon! Hope I didn't use up too many good karma points on that one :-);Intense Inktense pencils!
80;80.0;5.0;12.0;1424;These are great - I've used other high quality watercolor pencils but these seem to be a class of their own. I highly recommend you get a watercolor reservoir brush with the set. Just one of those brushes will take care of all your paintings. I have one from Pentel, and it is great.\n\nWhat I LOVE:\n\n-First of all, you can draw on yourself with these. Dip the tip of the pencil in water, and use as body paint. For someone who usually draws on my skin with sharpies, I feel like these pencils are much less toxic. Water dries, leaves color on skin, no crazy smells & harmful chemicals. They stay on for a long time if you don't rub/wash. So that is a very surprising/extra perk.\n\n-Range of color is good for all kinds of art, from landscape to abstract.\n\n-Color is INTENSE once wet. You watch the pencil lines transform into the most vibrant colors. It's really amazing. I love layering all over a page then go over it with a brush and watch my painting come alive.\n\n-A little goes a long way - You really don't need to lay it down thick. I've done 5 post card sized watercolor, and have not sharpened any pencils. This stuff is worth the money, really. With other watercolor pencils you have to keep sharpening.\n\n-Tin box feels professional & expensive. Easy to keep together.\n\nAnd...I have been painting with acrylics for over 2 years. I'm a new artist still so I try to experiment with a wide range of art materials. These pencils are truly a class of their own. Nothing else I have can do quite the same thing.\n\nOnly complaint is the pencil holders are flimsy plastic, and feels like they might break when you lift them up. Not sure how they can fix it, though. To keep it compact, plastic might just be the way to go. But maybe they can make the plastic more firm?\n\nAnyway, I thoroughly enjoy using these pencils and look forward to spending many a pleasant lonely evenings with them. Best friends forever!;Best Watercolor pencils I have ever tried
81;87.0;3.0;10.0;1436;I love these ink pencils, but you can't tell what color you are using while looking at the pencil. I now have yellow moss on my picture.  :)  There is no color chart included, which I am making myself out of 72 colors. Also, the 72 includes many dark colors and is short in the neutral and lighter colors. Still,  they are FUN to use.;Good product, bad representation of colors
82;88.0;5.0;10.0;1437;I really like this set as it introduces me to water colors ,I am glad I purchased the 72 count as the variety of shades is fantastic . The results look so professional and you would not know whether this was a pencil or mixed color in a palate .  There is however technique involved with these pencils ,  I have learned to very lightly lay down the color and, to layer to produce depth instead of leaning heavy on the paper  . I use a Canson  140lb paper and find the combination works great . These pencils sharpen well . I am very happy with this product .;Great quality
83;30.0;5.0;45.0;1450;"Admittedly, I am a very amateur artist.  Yet, I have always had a desire to be able to express myself pictorially.  To that end, I have read multiple books on drawing and painting in the last 20 years, but I felt I was always handicapped by what I believed to be a lack of small motor coordination.  Nonetheless, I persisted.  Knowing that one of my failings was a refusal to specialize in a particular area.  Thus, reaching all the way back to my roots and my undergraduate education as a Biology major, I decided that I would try to concentrate on ""Botanical Drawing.""  It is not that Botanicals are an easy representation, but it is rather that the majority of Botanicals have the same basic structural elements.  Thus, I purchased several books on Botanical Drawings and spent a considerable amount of money on a vast variety of drawing mediums.\n\nIn accordance to the teaching of the books I bought, I first started with pencil sketches.  As I progressed through the books that discussed Botanical representations, it turned out, that my initial believe was in fact true.  The very best and most renown Botanical Artists who have written books about how to draw plants and flowers have developed systems and methodologies that have a certain amount of commonality.  It turns out, that if one can draw three dimensional representations of cones, cylinders, spheres and a few other special elements, one can make pictorial representations of most Botanicals.  Thus, I spent some time perfecting my ability to draw non-Euclidian geometric shapes, which I had learned how to do when I took my 3 semesters of calculus in college.  And then, building upon that, I started to move into color mediums.\n\nFirst, I started with colored pencils.  Then I worked with 'nu-pastels' and pastel pencils.  Then I progressed into Aquarelles.  And from there, I started to work with watercolors.  But the most impressive medium of all, were these ""Derwent Inktense Pencils"" which are 4 mm core pencils, but with a special character.  While when one uses these pencils to draw, it feels very much like one is using a ""soft core pencil.""  However, there is an amazing, dazzling difference between these pencils and regular soft core pencils.\n\nThese Inktense Pencils are truly like drawing with watercolor pigments.  And the concept is, that the artist uses these pencils and their knowledge or color and form to create drawings that are then bought to an unbelievable level of intensity when they are brushed with water.  All of a sudden, what looked like just regular soft core pencil drawings take on an incredible illumination which is even more intense than using watercolor paints.  Yet, they have a special character to them that is not present with regular watercolors, be they pan watercolors or watercolors in tubes.  They first come alive under the wet brush.  But then, rather quickly, they dry to a permanent state, so that additional water no longer changes their hue and beauty.  It is so intense, that it defies a written description.  Yet, I am willing to attest to the fact that I have never seen anything like it.\n\nThere are two things that one should know about this medium though before embarking upon giving it a go.  The pencils are expensive, but they are worth every penny.  And, because of the way they come alive, the precision with which water is added to the dry image is of the most important and delicate process.  So much so, that not only is it expensive to buy the pencils, but it is almost a requirement that the artist utilizes the very best brushes to animate the pigments.  Personally, I have found that they only brushes that truly are worth using in order to get the most out of this medium are high end Sable Brushes.  Personally, I prefer pure Kolinsky Sable and Ussuri Sable brushes ONLY!  Many artists are quite familiar with these sable brushes and most watercolor and even acrylic and oil painters swear by sable brushes and will not use anything else.  The same is the case when using the Derwent Inktense Pencils.  Sable is rare and expensive.  Thus, not only are the pencils expensive, but so are the brushes.  Yet, the serious artist or even the aspiring serious artist must look upon the expense as an investment.  In fact, the more one gets into art supplies, the more one finds that the better supplies are the ones that cost the money.  Even the use of a palette made from white china, as opposed to the plastic kind is something that makes a significant difference, as the china does not stain, like the plastic ones do.\n\nNonetheless, I cannot recommend any other medium as highly as I can these special pencils.  And Derwent makes a very wonderful version of them.  While one can mix the colors before wetting them, it is very difficult to do so after they have been wet and then dried.  So, the artist will want to be careful in their selection of the specific colors that they choose and would be well advised to test the colors on another piece of watercolor paper before committing it t their actual drawing so they are sure that they have the right colors and hues.\n\nI would whole heartedly endorse these Inktense Pencils by Derwent over every other medium I have yet to try.  The artist will NOT be disappointed!";Water Colors Extraordinaire!
84;131.0;4.0;5.0;1453;They are easy to use and have wonderfully intense colour. I use it mostly for shading on fabric and it works very well.;Ease of use and intense colour
85;77.0;3.0;13.0;1477;I was so excited to have 72 gorgeous Inktense colors to play with only to find that so many are too similar...the variety I was expecting just isn't there. Rather disappointed...;Not What I Was Hoping For
86;53.0;2.0;22.0;1485;I like the feel of the pencils.  They are very nice to work with.  However, the color inticators on the end of the pencils is very wrong in many cases.  It's irritating to pick a color that looks like what I want only to find out instead of a light brown shade I end up with an ugly green.\nI also think it is unnecessary to have 5 blacks and several dark blues  that all are VERY close in color.;Derwent Intence Ink Pencils
87;112.0;5.0;7.0;1522;I love these Derwent Inktense pencils!  They can be used as pencils on dry or wet paper or you can pick up the color directly from the pencil with a damp paintbrush and apply it.  The colors are vibrant but it does take awhile to get used to what color, exactly, the dry pencils will produce once wet.  I recommend creating a wet/dry swatch of all of your colors and the color names to keep on hand for reference until you get used to them.  If light fastness is a really big concern for you, do note that some of the colors don't have a very high light fast rating.  In fairness though, they seem to be the colors that have that issue across other mediums as well.  These pencils are absolutely fantastic for illustration type drawings.  They work well for layering using light washes or for making bold marks on damp paper.  I highly recommend them to anyone who likes to draw or paint and wishes to experiment with another medium.;An Art Supply Favorite
88;132.0;5.0;5.0;1530;I am enjoying these very much. They are so easy to use and the results are great. I am a rubber stamper and make all of my greeting cards. I have used other water color methods which are fine but I really like the results I get with these. Product met my expectations after seeing them in my stamping magazine.;Completely satisfied
89;13.0;5.0;110.0;1531;"I've been an artist most of my life and I've experimented with nearly every type of art media at one time or another, but I always came back to pencil and ink because I can work on the detail I prefer and I'm comfortable with my monochrome artwork . However, a few years ago, I was convinced to give color another try, using color and watercolor pencils that were given me to try. I'd never really mastered color. Black, blue or grey and white were my forte. But the Derwent's Inktense watercolor pencils I received have changed all that. They let me draw in color and then use a brush to make that color as permanent as any permanent ink! And, because  they are permanent once they dry, I can add layer after layer of color with no fear of getting that muddy color all watercolorists must hate! They are not at all like regular watercolor pencils; activate them with a watercolor brush and let them dry and the paint can't be re-wet like regular watercolor pencils or watercolor paint can. They become a permanent ink!\n\nAlso, the colors Inktense pencils can create are far more bright and vibrant than and other color pencil, watercolor pencil or watercolor paint can ever hope too! And if you add more color to that you've already laid down, it becomes even more intense! These are awesome tools for any artist.\n\nThe best paper to use these pencils on is 140 1b. cold press, hot press or rough watercolor paper. I find Arches to be my favorite watercolor so far, though I'm not really sure why. You should also keep in mind that Inktense watercolor pencils dry much faster than regular watercolors, so don't goof about with the work. Be serious about your work, as all artists should be!\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND INKTENSE WATERCOLOR PENCILS!!!!!!!";Excellent! These Inktense Ink/Watercolor Pencils are AWESOME! A+++++
90;133.0;5.0;5.0;1538;Great pencils for painting on fabric.  Takes a little trial and error to get the best effects.  Great color range.;Fun
91;134.0;5.0;5.0;1539;I purchased the 12 count from Amazon and these are my favorite water soluble pencil so far. The colors lay down with kind of a bitoned brilliant color. I really like the bright green color. You should try them if you like watercolor. I can draw pretty well so these pencils kind of help me cheat. I can't paint a picture as well as I can draw one so I draw it first then turn it into a painting. Pretty Awesome!;Pretty Cool
92;89.0;2.0;10.0;1539;There are only 3 of the Inktense pencils in the selection.  The others are other types of water color pencils.  The description of the product was very misleading.;Product description misleading
93;82.0;3.0;12.0;1543;I used the pencils and the blocks on fabric.  I let them dry for 3 days and then heat set them.  They bled when I ran them under water.  They may be fine on paper, but I bought them for fabric as advertized.;They were not permanent on fabric
94;135.0;4.0;5.0;1554;Recently, I became interested in Zentangles. I researched a pencil to use and found that these were well-liked.  They are great for doing my Zentangles. I am going to purchase a larger set of these pencils so that I will have more colors.;Quality Product!
95;136.0;5.0;5.0;1567;I was disappointed when I completed my order and found the delivery date to be a month away but was thrilled to receive the pencils within 12 days. They arrived in excellent condition and the one layer tin makes them easy to use. Color range is ideal for botanical drawings producing intense, vibrant colors on fabric and paper.;Outstanding value
96;69.0;5.0;16.0;1569;I'm a quilter and have heard others talk about Inktense.  Finally decided to bite the bullet and order...how much fun these are on FABRIC!  Have done a couple of things with different fabric types: canvas and quilting cotton.  SO impressed with outcome.  Easy to work with and vibrant!  I mostly colored areas first, then went over with 50/50 mix of Liquitex Fabric Effects Medium and water...blends like a dream on fabric...wish I could post a pic of my fun!;Inktense by Derwent are amazing to work with!
97;137.0;1.0;5.0;1574;The pencils were OK, but the metal tin arrived bumped. The packaging was too thin and unsafe for this product.;Metel tin was bumped
98;138.0;4.0;5.0;1607;These pencils are very vibrant and intense. I'd venture to say that they are not as subtle as I might want. I have other Derwent and Karat pencils that have more subtle colors. I like these, but wish they had more subtle variety in the 24 pack. Lots of darks and greens but not enough red/orange/yellow/beige variations. The colors are much brighter than the color indicator on the pencil shaft.;Very bright colors
99;75.0;4.0;14.0;1613;I scrapbook and make cards a ton and I wanted some other creative way to add color instead of stamping just ink colors.  On water color paper I use black, brown or grey momento ink for the outline, then let it dry and then I color in the picture and apply water with a water brush.  It's fun to do and easy.  You can get different intensities depending on how much you color the image.  They are expensive and that might affect while size set you use but do know you can mix colors such as red and blue to get various shades of purple.  Learn your color wheel and you can get away with buying a smaller set.  It comes in a metal case and if you add a thick rubber band it travels easily.;They are a fun alternative to add to your craft collection!
100;115.0;5.0;7.0;1638;These pencils are absolutely amazing! I really love them and I'm angling to get the biggest set they have so I can have all the glorious colors.\n\nI draw mostly sketches of clothes/drawings, sketches of jewelry, and I adore bright, vibrant colors, in life and on paper. Normal watercolor pencils are beautiful when you want muted colors, but I wanted/needed something much stronger than that. I saw videos of people using inktense and I was amazed at the vibrancy and saturation of the pencils so of course I had to try the pencils.\n\nThey are every bit as wonderful as you expect them to be, plus more. With just a little bit of intense color, you get a pop of color when water is added. And it dries very quickly which is a good and bad thing. Good in that things won't schmear. Bad in that you really have to work quickly so that you don't get a visible line where the ink already dried, but you realize that you should have covered more of the area and try to paint it again, and now you have two tones.\n\nBut you get used to the pencils' personalities and quickly adapt.\n\nIf you're worried that the pencils are too saturated/vibrant, don't be. Add more water and the colors thin out. I draw in certain areas, then paint over that to get the vibrant color, then use the residual color left on the paintbrush to paint areas that I want lighter but in the same shade, and I get a beautiful wash of color - sort of like with watercolor pencils.\n\nI haven't tried the pencils on fabric yet but I will and I'm sure it'll be awesome.\n\nSeriously, you'll fall in love with these pencils.;love the vibrancy of the colors!
101;60.0;5.0;21.0;1652;I received this set directly from Derwent after emailing to inform them of a faulty product I had just purchased.  It was a very kind gesture, and I must commend them on their customer service.  I hope to never have a problem again, but if I do, I am confident that they will handle it fantastically.\n\nI have worked with water soluble colored pencil before (Caran D'Ache Prismalos), but I was not happy with the hardness of the lead, or the quality of the color after wetting.  Since I use Prismacolor non soluble pencils, I had been planning on trying their watercolor pencils, but after these, I don't think I can.\n\nThe color is so rich and creamy, and it lays down on the paper very easily.  These colors are intense when dry, but after they are wet, they really come into their own.  Great layering and shading, and I like the fact that these 'set' when dry (you cannot reactivate them with water), so it is easy to build color.  The color range is great as well.  I still love Prismacolor for their range and feel on dry pencils, but for watercolor, I am blown away by Derwent.\n\nI definitely plan on buying the full set of 72 colors in the future.;Brilliant color with smooth lay down

103;48.0;5.0;27.0;1697;I bought this set after taking a local class.  We were taught to use them on fabric using the 5 color set.  I was so impressed I bought the largest set available.  If I can't find something locally, Amazon is the first place I look for something.  When water is added, the color gets really intense so go very light at first and get a feel for them.  We heat set them with an iron since it was on fabric.  I haven't tried them on paper yet.;Really intense
104;4.0;4.0;346.0;1714;"I am just starting to learn how to paint and decided to buy Derwent's Inktense pencils with a gift card I got for Christmas. As other reviewers have noted, the colors are very intense and they are not at all like regular watercolor pencils - they are ink.  This means that once the color has been ""activated"" with water and dries, it can no longer be moved around or manipulated.  This makes them a little more difficult to handle than regular watercolors.  I have learned a few tricks worth sharing:\n1. To create a streak-free area of one color (like a sky), shave off little bits of the color pencil lead into a cup and add water to create a wet ink.  Then use a wet-on-wet technique to get a streak free space. You can use paper towels to pick up the color while it is still wet to create clouds etc.\n2. The pencils can be layered.  Once dry, you can add another layer of the same color to get a more intense color or a different color if you want to make adjustments.\n3. If you want a very strong color, try wetting your brush and rubbing it on the tip of the pencil to get the pigment onto your brush.\n4. The colors will bleed, just like watercolors, so wait for areas to dry before progressing if you want distinct areas of color.\n5. The white color pencil can be layered onto other colors, but it will appear translucent.  It can make a cool rain effect on a blue sky.\n6. I find it best to put down a variety of colors all at once and then (very carefully) wet them with my brush, starting with the lightest colors first.  This allows the colors to all blend together and avoids sharp lines of color demarcation.\nI have been using 140 lb Strathmore watercolor paper and this works fine.  I tried cheaper stuff and it didn't look quite as nice.  I have not tried a water pen yet.  Maybe with my next gift card :-)  I am giving these pencils 4 stars instead of 5 because of how quickly they dry, which causes streaking (this is most obvious in the blue color tones, I think).";Not at all like regular watercolor pencils
105;107.0;3.0;8.0;1716;I was really expecting this to be intense colors from what i saw on videos on youtube and i have the regular derwent water color pencils.  To be honest i cant tell the difference and the only way to get the color to be more intense is to press harder.  So for the price you may as well stick with the regular pencils their cheaper with the same results;same as the regular water color pencils

108;27.0;5.0;60.0;1748;The introduction of this range was big news. Vibrant, jewel-like colours, they brought about a revolution in the coloured pencil world.

They came with an outliner pencils too which was water-resistant  - no bleeding!\n\nThe outliner is lovely - like a graphite pencil but oh-so smooth. Handsome livery too - dark royal blue with gold detailing. High lightfastness on the darker end of the range with 3/4s at the lighter end - something to consider.

Found these on Amazon, a set of 72 for not much more than what I paid for 24 locally.  These make drawing/painting a most pleasurable experience and produce amazing results.  The range of colors is great, and they can be blended easily.  My only wish is that they had several colors that approximate true sking tones, especially for Caucasian skin tones.  I do mostly drawings of Native Americans and can blend several of these colors to true tones, especially using Willow and a light graphite shading.  If you love these as much as I do, you'll also want Derwent's Graphtint Pencils (set of 24), which has more earthly tones, but works very well with the inktense - both are water soluble and produce anything as good as true water-colors can.

It comes in different sizes and is a really great addition to your art supply.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ranger-TIP33080-Tim-Holtz-Water-Brush-With-Fine-Detailer-Nib-6-Inch/dp/B007FXPGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ranger TIP33080 Tim Holtz Water Brush With Fine Detailer Nib, 6-Inch</a>";Amazing Pencils
115;109.0;5.0;8.0;1816;"The Derwent Inktense pencils lay down color with such ease I'd never known before! They are like NO other color pencil or watercolor pencil I'd used... well, of course because they aren't! But when you see them, handle them, and first go to work with them, that's what you might expect, but what an incredible surprise! The amout of pigment is amazing! Whether you choose to leave part of your work pencil-like, or make it all inky-water soluable - it's a matter of choice. No matter what you do, you won't be unhappy, these pencils (and that's just not the right word for them!) are like nothing else you've ever worked with! Pure joy! And if you're anything like me... I can guarantee, if you try a few pencils... you'll want a larger set -- and a set of 12 just won't cut it; maybe 36 will - it remains to be seen! For me... well... 72!\nThe pure ecstacy of 72 amazing inky amazingly full of color like you've never seen in a water soluable pencil.\n\nThey're pigmentlicious pencils, and at $109 this is an excellent deal!!! (I'm not sure the Reeves Derwent is the same as just fthe Derwent though! Reeves Derwent might be a student grade - I'll double chk and come bk with the answer!)\n\nWithout a doubt I'd recommend you buy NOW if you can!\nEven better Next Day if possible!\nA+, 5 STAR item!\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Derwent-Inktense-Pencils-Inktense-Pencils-Set-of-72/dp/B005FM7F3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Derwent Inktense Pencils - Inktense Pencils, Set of 72</a>";Amazingly easy to work with!
116;32.0;5.0;44.0;1833;All the reviews I have read are from people who are using these for drawings.  For all the quilters these pencils are amazing!  You can accent any of your fabrics with these pencils. Once you add a small amount of water, the colors are permanent.\nYou can add color shadings, draw your own pictures on fabric, have the kids color something special and then add their drawing to your quilting project.  If you have a spot on your clothes that has been bleached out, color over with the pencils and add your water and now your clothing is back like new.  You can mix the colors to get any shade you want.  The color will get a little darker when you add the water.  Possibilities are endless!;Derwent Inktense Pencil Set is great for Quilters!
117;99.0;5.0;9.0;1836;Definitely happy with this set. They're bright, blend beautifully and really have a high quality. They take a little getting used to, but I thought they were worth the time and money to get such great quality.;Worth it
118;100.0;5.0;9.0;1844;"This makes it so you can make real ""Paintings"" with pencils.  I have already owned Watercolor pencils and they left me wanting more intense colors.  Now I create full vibrant paintings/drawings with this.  I will probably buy more colors soon to fill in some holes.  If you really like the idea of these amazing pencils, you may just want to get a bigger set - they are that good!\n\nOne extra thing I'm going to probably blog about soon in more detail is mixing them with Gouache Paint (White specifically).  White is the only color you'll need but it really changes and completes what Inktense pencils can do.  Rather than leaving blank paper for white areas or highlights, you can use Gouache Paint to add these spots after laying a background and then you can also blend this with some color.  This makes it easier to make a large blended background area and then add clouds or other things on top of it.  It makes it more like making an Oil or Acrylic Painting than a watercolor painting and I like this effect better.  (Of course for large white areas using the paper's white would be better)\n\nWith this combo it really completes the medium.\n\nI also bought a Water brush with it and I love it - the trick I found with that is to have a paper towel nearby and daub the tip off so it doesn't get too wet, unless you want that.  With this level of control, detail work is finally not so hard!";Inktense = perfect medium... try using White Gouache with it
119;56.0;5.0;24.0;1934;Excellent pencils thru and thru. They lay down smoothly and have nice coverage...but adding water is where these pencils really shine. Very nice color intensity and soft blending. I use a Pentel Aquash Pen/brush for washing the colors and it works perfectly with these pencils. I also use Derwent's standard wc pencils, and the Inktense are definitely more bang for coverage and color. (Not that the standard ones are inferior by any means...just different pigment load and intensity.)\nI definitely recommend...;Inktense is a good name and description
120;24.0;5.0;79.0;2006;"I've bought tons of art supplies over the years, including other water-soluble pencils. As I'm sure you noticed from the description, Inktense are different in that, once wet, then dried, the color is permanent. You can use them as dry pencils and the pigment/binder is soft enough to get a nice deep shade of your color. When you add water, however, the color really pops. The perfect companion for these is a waterbrush. With the Inktense pencils, a waterbrush & a small drawing pad, you've got a portable mini ""studio"".\n\nI started with the 12-pencil set, in case I wasn't happy with them. I plan on buying a bigger set when these are gone (or maybe even before!) so I can have more colors. The 12-color set set I received includes the following colors:\n-Poppy Red\n-Deep Indigo\n-Bark\n-Apple Green\n-Deep Earth\n-Teal Green\n-Sun Yellow\n-Sea Blue\n-Leaf Green\n-Fuschia\n-Tangerine\n-Ink Black\n\nI've seen, on other sites, sets of 12 with different colors, but this is what I received from this seller.\nI use them with a fine point Sharpie since the Sharpie ink is unaffected by water. I love using these and I think you will, too!";Inktensity!
121;61.0;5.0;22.0;2011;I enjoy using these pencils so much!  So many possibilities...I am experimenting and having a blast! I am trying to illustrate my first childrens book, and not a pro yet, but these pencils should satisfy pro or beginner.  With all of the possibilities of technique and blending they offer, a beginner can feel like a pro. They even include a tutorial website.;Party supplies for you & your muse
122;47.0;5.0;30.0;2086;I love these pencils!! They are very pigmented and are smoother than regular watercolor pencils. Amazon's price is better than all my local art stores too.;love these!!
123;58.0;5.0;24.0;2102;i bought this pencil set for myself and i just adore them.  the colors are intense, hence the name, and when you can add water to it, the colors GREATLY change!! this also totally smoothes out the color, not lines at all, so this makes for endless ideas and exciting art.\ni like to wet the outlines of my art for greater emphasis and defination, all in all, a whole lot of fun for the price.;awesome pencils
124;40.0;5.0;38.0;2102;The 'Art Rebel' that I am, I wanted to try something more exciting than regular colored pencils . I draw a lot of faces and combine different mediums. Like watercolor and a layer of pastels and add fine details with pencil. I was very happy to see that these Derwent pencils, which are really a form of ink, blended in so well with the watercolor I was doing and after it was dry stayed in place even when the paper was wet. I also found that I can take a wet brush, rub it against the pencil tip and get instant 'wash' to apply to my painting. I just love this product. Derwent is of superior quality and well worth the money. If you buy it here on Amazon its a lot cheaper than in the art store. While the Inktense have a deeper more intense color it can be lightned by adding the color with a brush OR just buy a set of Derwent Graphite pencils . They are much lighter and good for a lighter wash.;Im the art rebel
125;35.0;5.0;42.0;2137;I have been using Inktense pencils for my illustration projects for almost a year, and since the very first day, I have been so impressed with them that I rarely use anything else.  I have the 24 set that I keep in my bag because it is portable, and the 72 set for my more involved artwork. These high quality ink pencils are unlike anything else I have ever worked with.  They can be layered endlessly (depending on the quality of your paper) because they are permanent when they dry, allowing for a great deal of detail and complexity.  They are bold and vibrant, and they are easy enough to use that anyone can make beautiful art with them, regardless of the person's level of experience. I have seen little children as young as four years old create very high quality art with them. Since I use my Inktense pencils with the kind of paintbrush that holds the water in the handle, I am able to sketch with them wherever I go.  This kit is just the right size to fit in a small tote bag for painting anywhere you feel inspired.\n\nI have used mine on mixed media paper, Bristol board, watercolor paper, canvas panels, and stretched canvas, each with slightly different results because of the variety of techniques these pencils allow.  I have even saved the shavings to tie-dye a pillowcase, and for making abstract designs for greeting card backgrounds. These pencils make it easy to be flexible, spontaneous and creative in countless ways.  They can also be used for silk painting, and for coloring quilts, because they are able to act as a fabric dye when the fabric is wet, or when you use a wet brush to apply them.  I recommend these pencils wholeheartedly.;Most Amazing Pencils Ever!
126;64.0;1.0;21.0;2182;I love intense color, so when I found these on sale for $14 I thought I'd try them. After doing so I can say that if these are so brilliant compared to watercolor pencil, then I shudder to think how pale regulair watercolor pencils are. Inktense pencils are just slightly brighter than colored pencils. Gel pens, and  inks I draw with blow them out of the sky when it comes to color saturation and vibrancy.\n\nHowever, for those who think that colored pencils are plenty bright, these are also the very best made pencils I have seen.  They're soft and not waxy like regulair colored pencils.  They also have a very nice pencil smell. When wetted, the pencil marks don't dissolve completely, but I hear that they do on gesso. A good quality product if your fine with a watercolor look. Just not that intense.;Not really intense
127;62.0;5.0;22.0;2197;These pencils are amazing!  They can be used as is, by dipping the pencil in water and painting with the pencil tip wet, by painting over dry pencil marks with water.  When I paint watercolor landscapes, I outline the shapes with an orange-red Inktense pencil.  Then I wet the line that I've drawn.  When it dries it is waterproof and can be painted over without the color running into the shape you just put on your paper. The sets have great colors, too! I love them, and my 6-year-old great-granddaughter does, too!;Fantastic Art Tool!
128;71.0;5.0;18.0;2255;This is a fantastic water color pencil set!  I got them for a friend of mine who loves to paint and draw.  She had wanted to try this type of pencil out.  She was thrilled with the results.  The colors really pop!  She was very excited with the fact that once they dry if you get it wet again it won't run.  Great for people who want to use wet media over these.;Great Pencils!!
129;90.0;5.0;12.0;2278;"I have used several different brands in the past; not the best. Started using the Derwent Inktense Watersoluble Ink Pencils as soon as I got them and LOVE THEM!!!!";Love Them!!
130;67.0;5.0;20.0;2292;These were recommended by a fellow artist friend and I have really found them to be useful. They are more vibrant and permanent than watercolor pencils and easy to work with. So far I have only been experimenting with them but intend to use them with both watercolor and acrylic paints in the future. They are best used as an adjunct to these, rather than on their own. Once dry you can paint over them, either to enhance the color and detail or add another shade of color. Thus layering is easy!  At least this is what I've found out thus far. Good for detailed and fine work, but I think they would be good also for wider strokes also. I would certainly recommend them to those who like a more meticulous and detailed type of painting.;from The Dancing Brush
131;37.0;5.0;44.0;2459;I like these new pencils as the product claims they are permanent. They're like watercolor pencils only once make a wash with them the color doesn't smear. I found I had to wait a day before varnishing painting so they wouldn't smear, but look forward to testing these pencils again soon!;New Intense Pencils by Derwent
132;51.0;4.0;31.0;2552;I bought the Derwent Inktense Watersoluble Ink Pencils for art quilts.  I color on fabric, then wet them using a waterbrush to make them permanent.  I recommend buying a waterbrush with your pencils to have more control over the water.  I have been told they are permanent anyway - haven't washed anything yet.  It's just like using any coloring pencils, until you wet them.  You can apply lightly to get a light color, or make them more intense by applying more pressure for more color.  They are really fun.;Coloring!
133;5.0;5.0;365.0;2594;I already reviewed these in the 12 pack set, but since I loved them enough to buy buy a bigger pack I figured I'd point out the color differences for those who may be debating about which size package to get as there really are differences...\n\nHere is what you get in a 12 pack vs a 24:\n\n12 = Cherry, Tangerine, Sun Yellow, Apple Green, Leaf Green, Teal Green, Sea Blue, Deep Indigo, Fuchsia, Baked Earth, Bark, Ink Black\n\n24 = Poppy Red, Chilli Red, Shiraz, Tangerine, Sun Yellow, Sherbert Yellow, Apple Green, Field Green, Leaf Green, Teal Green, Iris Blue, Bright Blue, Deep Indigo, Sea Blue, Fuchsia, Violet, Mustard, Baked Earth, Willow, Bark, Charcoal Grey, Ink Black, Antique White, Outliner;Bought a bigger set, if that says anything
134;43.0;5.0;39.0;2638;These inks are wonderful on fabric. I use them to enhance my digital prints of original photographs.  They are not nearly as messy as using tubes or tablets.  Amazon Verified Purchase.;amazing
135;11.0;5.0;151.0;2644;"My mom informed me that she was sending me some watercolor like pencils - but different as a gift.  I thought ""okay, well I'll be using those as colored pencils then"" as I'd had watercolor pencils before and was never impressed by any of them.  She assured me these pencils are impressive.  Bright.  Could be used on fabrics.  Blah blah blah.  It all went in one ear and out the other really.  They arrived.  I drew with them.  Didn't really bother trying the water aspect until I got bored one day.\n\nWOAH.  I should have listened to mom.  We've all learned by now our moms are usually right, right?  Yeah these colors are really intense - ok INKtense after you add water.  In fact they're nice and all when you draw with them but really they're much better with water, which is a first for me with pencils meant to be used with water.  The colors lighten and brighten so much after adding water that I almost couldn't believe they came from these pencils.  Once dry you can layer new color on top of them, ink over them, etc.  The original wash will stay pretty well set if truly dry.\n\nI've not experimented on fabrics yet beyond a quick test that I haven't yet washed, but they did work well and my mom assures me if handled properly they work well (a quick search will find you tips for setting them into the fabric though all you need is a fabric medium and an iron).\n\nI'd probably go with a larger set but starting small never hurt anyone.  Personally I plan on buying more colors.";Intense colors from a pencil finally
136;17.0;5.0;110.0;2696;There is so much good to say I don't know where to start.  Derwent Inktense watercolor pencils are definately worth the price.  These are not your ole Crayola watercolor pencils for the kids.  What intrigues me is how much this medium of watercolor pencils calls out to your own style and drawing out your own creativity.  You can draw as pencil and then paint over with water, dip in water like a rad marker, or make little pools on a pallette and mix in, just to start with a few methods.  The colors on these are incredible.\n\nMy favorite method thus far is to ink my basic shapes as you would in cartoon drawing.  Then come back to fill in areas with the pencils dry.  Then to lightly transform the dry color with water on a small brush.  There is so much control here that you will find yourself working in nuances and subtle gradations that are not really possible in many other mediums.  There is just something about this combination of easy, good looking, and highly portable, to make this art form, and these Derwent pencils, a runaway hit in the small art world.  I like them so much that I got rid of my acrylics and have switched to these as my primary painting mode.;WOW !, like encountering your creativity for the first time
137;28.0;5.0;76.0;2876;These pencils are absolutely wonderful. I have other watercolor pencils, a huge set of regular Prismacolor pencils, tube watercolors, pan watercolors, pastels, and on and on. Of all of my art supplies, these are unquestionably the best for what I do as a costume designer. I love them. As the other reviewers have mentioned, there is a dearth of lighter colors, which I have to compensate for by using flesh tones and pastel shades from other watercolor pencil sets, but otherwise, these are incredible. I have the 24 pencil set of them, and I am looking to purchase a larger (probably the 72 pencil set) today.  They do take a little experimentation and getting used to, as with any medium, but they are absolutely a pleasure to use.;The Clear Favorite in an Extensive Art Supply Collection
138;7.0;5.0;337.0;3338;"I first bought the set of 24 Derwent Inktense watercolor pencils, and liked them so much I then bought the set of 72 (order the 72 pencil set from one of the art stores like Blick Art at [...]  These pencils are different from any other watercolor pencils, in two ways. First, they produce spectacularly vivid & bright colors, which are closer to what you can get with watercolor or gouache than any other watercolor pencil I've tried.  Second, as the other reviewer stated, when dry they are permanent, meaning if you wet the picture again, the colors won't run.  That might be a positive or a negative for you, depending how you work.  Though these colors are vivid and bright, you'll want to still keep your Caran D'Ache or other more traditional watercolor pencils, because one of the drawbacks of this set (even the 72-pencil set) is that lightest shades of many colors are not included or even available in the set.  For instance, there is no pink or light blue, no light green, no light lavender.  So with the Derwent Inktense you can't really create a very ""high-key"" picture, one that tends heavily toward whites and light colors, as you can with a Caran D'Ache set.  (You CAN do the low-key image, one tending toward the darker tones...)\n  Although the pencils are ostensibly marked with a colored end to show which color they are, the colors on the ends of the pencils sometimes are lighter than the actual hue produced, so those markings are misleading.\n  I also have the Derwent Graphitint set of 24 watercolor pencils which I like when I want to produce something of more subdued, earth-tone colors, since they offer a more muted palette.  They are great as well!";Truly intense color, different than other watercolor pencils
139;20.0;5.0;123.0;3753;I own this set, and have only just begun experimenting with the possibilities.  The colors are vivid, and once dry they are permament, which is good for me as I'm not experienced with traditional watercolor techniques.  My set bought at a retail store came with a 20 minute  DVD with helpful hints and tips.\nI love that this set comes with an insoluble pencil so that any outlines or guidelines that one has made will not disappear when you add water.  Also, I plan to get extras of the black inktense pencil, as it is like having a portable inkwell that won't spill all over my car's upholstery or in my purse.  It provides a velvety black as tested on my watercolor paper.\nIf you love both drawing with pencils of any kind as well as with pen and ink, this set offers a wonderful hybrid of the two.  I think it is especially great to add to a traveling art kit.  I just think its altogether great.\nI can't wait to try Derwent's graphitint line as well.;Innovative and Exciting!

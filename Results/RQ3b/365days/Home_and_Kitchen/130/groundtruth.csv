0;2.0;4.0;17.0;0;"I've had this juicer now for 4 years now and I thought I would share my experiences...\n\nPROS:\n1) Maximum Extraction!\nThe juicer is an excellent product. It extracts almost every last drop of juice. There are only a couple juicers that get more juice out, but they cost $1000s more.\n\n2) EASY TO CLEAN!\nThis thing is SO EASY TO CLEAN. I cannot tell you how nice it is cleaning this versus my Breville. Plus, you can hook the discard shoot up to a bag to collect as much waste as you want, which is very nice. We feed the ""waste"" to our chickens who love the scraps.\n\n3) Easy to work with\nAssembly and disassembly was well thought out in this product - very simple. They even provide a handle on top of it which makes it easy to lift off the counter for storage in your cabinets. (But looks great on the counter too).\n\nCONS:\n1) Prep work\nIt does take a while to prep the veggies/fruits for this juicer. I solved apples by buying a corer/slicer which makes the process almost instantaneous, but you still have to feed pieces through the chute.\n\n2) Takes a while\nTakes a while to make juice. As in, about 15 minutes to make 4 12 oz glasses of juice comprised of: apples, carrots, beet, ginger, lemon, lime, tumeric. I have this down to a science (grams) with my scale. So, that makes it easier - but still, it takes 15 minutes from the time you get the veggies out to the time you are drinking juice. Don't let that dissuade you though!\n\n3) Filter screen weak?\nI had used this for 3 years daily until the first screen broke (which is impressive - but really, if they make it out of uni body stainless steel, it would last forever). I ordered a replacement screen here on Amazon, but that piece of garbage only lasted 2 months (no exaggeration).\n\nOVERALL:\nI LOVE this juicer. I only wish it were faster. And, I do wish they would take the time to make a serious heavy duty screen.\n\nI also have the Breville BJE510XL, which is a far far faster juicer - but, it doesn't even get close to as much juice out as the Omega. Expect to use about 50%-100% more vegetable/fruit in the Breville. I've actually considered using the Breville as a first pass, and then feed the Omega with Breville's shreddings, but that's just way too much work.\n\nI hope this helps!";My thoughts after 4 years: STILL AWESOME!
1;17.0;1.0;13.0;194;Darn! I ordered this juicer (the Omega J8005) May 18, 2015, received it 9 days later and it broke the next day on its maiden voyage juicing a little wheat grass. After throwing away several days worth of grass I received a new replacement part (the screen) and used it for a couple of weeks before it broke again. Same part. So I decided to return it. Yet now Amazon informs me that the return window has closed for this product as of yesterday, June 27. Thus my opening exclamation.\n\nThere's something seriously wrong with this juicer. Which is weird because I had an Omega J8003 several years ago and it worked very well using what appears to be the same part. To bad I sold it to a friend.\n\nAnd yes, I know what I'm doing. No way am I overfeeding the chute. I never even used the plunger to squessh it down. Just hand fed it a little at a time. The part is clearly defective. Or maybe its the barrel that is not holding the screen tight enough and letting it expand until it cracks? The sound it makes when self-destructing is obvious.\n\nMaybe they will send me another one? Still I wish I had bought something else. Maybe another 8003? Either way, I'm greatly disappointed with Amazon for having only a 30-day return window that begins on the day you bought it instead of the day you received it. That's just outrageous.\nShame on Amazon.com.;Seriously defective, brand new juicer - and a day too late to return it.
2;34.0;2.0;11.0;667;"This juicer is NOT good for soft, pulpy fruits like berries and mango. Pineapple and citruses are ok in small amounts because the pulps get stuck to the auger making it difficult to turn if you juice a whole pineapple. So this was the only con worth the 1-star deduction.\n\nCleaning this machine is a breeze. I take the attachments apart and rinse immediately after use, then use the brush provided to clean the mesh bit on the tip of the nozzle, which is only about 1""x1"". I had used centrifugal juicers for years and cleaning them took forever so I avoided juicing often, but not with this one - I juice every day because it's so easy!\n\nI saw someone commenting about how the juicer is not as heavy duty as it looks because it's not metal. I have to disagree with them because metal generates heat that oxidizes the juice and may also REACT with the acid in the juices. The plastic material is of good quality and the auger is very solid and powerful enough to crush fruits and vegetables. I have no problem with that.\n\nI have been juicing daily for 1 month and health benefits are apparent. My skin cleared up, stomach and heartburn problems gone and I feel more energized in general.\n\n***UPDATED 9/24/2014***\nI have been using the juicer for over 6 months now and the plastic bit that wraps around the metal mesh on the juicing screen (See part [...]) has cracked. Seeing as it is still under warranty, I wrote to the customer service almost 3 weeks ago but have not heard back from them. Deducted one more star for now. Will update.\n\n***UPDATED 11/25/2016***\nI spent $10 replacing the nozzle part mentioned above when it broke after 6 months, and had been using about twice a week until it stoped working recently. Nothing happens when I switched it on, but the reverse mode still works, which is useless if it can't juice anymore. I am sad that it only lasted less than 3 years with normal use and I didn't even juice every day. I doubt the 10-year warranty will cover this but I will check with them.";Motor has worn out after less than 3 years. RIP
3;84.0;1.0;5.0;735;Just buy the blendtec blender instead and save yourself the headache that this juicer gives you. You're looking at about 35-50 mins to prepare, juice, and clean up. The feed chute is/has to small of an opening to get your vegetables in there, the catch containers are small (so you'll end up constantly draining and throwing away mulch), the motor gets the juicer hot (not sure if this is good or bad, but it's annoying), this beast is heavy as hell and takes up too much space, and lastly there are too many pieces.\n\nI wanted this juicer for two years and was very disappointed with the amount of work you gotta put in to get some juice. It's annoying, very annoying.\n\nCheck out the blendtec juicer. When I saw the demonstration at Cotsco my mind was blown at the simplicity compared to these other juicers. I'm in the middle of returning the omega one because I've been using my blendtec juicer and having a great time.\n\nSorry for the rant but for $300 I was really unimpressed with the omega.;If you're patient and love to clean buy this juicer.
4;70.0;2.0;7.0;1008;I chose this juicer over a centrifugal style because I have read that the juice quality is better.  I've only had it 1 day, but the juice was great, and the pulp was very dry.  As others have said, the prep time is a bit more involved.  You do have to cut fruit/veg pieces fairly small as the feed shoot is narrow.  I noted that the manual even recommends cutting them all up in small pieces to achieve better juice quality.  However, I feel the time is worth it (and I am a busy mom!)\n\nOther pluses:  Easy to assemble/disassemble and clean.\n\nUpdate: We loved this juicer.  We were making both green and fruit juice daily, (plus frozen juice sorbets that my 4-year old son loves).  HOWEVER:  I am concerned today as I  noticee the plastic auger has worn in places (and it's only been 4 days!)  I am sad to say that we are going to return it.  I am juicing for the whole family and do not want plastic particles or dust in our juice.  I did love this juicer...I've reduced my rating to 2 stars b/c auger is wearing and we have to return it.;Works Great & Great Juice but be Prepared for Prep (Plastic Auger Chipping)
5;72.0;2.0;7.0;1044;Easy to use, to clean, and the juice is delicious. It does take some time to make a lot, but we would set aside a few hours on the weekend and juice enough for the entire week. It's totally worth the effort. The bummer is Omega's customer service. We had the juicer for less that 4 months when the basket piece cracked. This should be covered under warranty so we contacted Omega approximately 5 times (via phone messages and email), and never once received a response. We finally were so tired of being without the juicer, we bought the replacement piece, which very well may be Omega's M.O. Due to this, we would seriously explore other manufacturers when purchasing in the future.\n\nUpdate: Terrible customer service. We ordered the spare part, but it turned out to be the wrong piece. And, they don't even sell the spare part we need on their site... for their own product. We immediately tried to return the wrong part, but there's no return information enclosed in the box or on their site. In this day and age of internet shopping, Omega is extremely antiquated where support and service are concerned. Our juicer has now not been working for the majority of time that we have owned it.;Good product, terrible service
6;46.0;5.0;11.0;1046;"OOOOoooooo-MEGA J8005 (five, five, five, five)!\nTHE GREATEST (greatest, greatest, greatest) JUICER (juicer, juicer, juicer) EVER! (ever, ever, ever, ever)\n\nSince Joe Cross and Phil Staples convicted me of my fatitiude in ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"" I've felt overwhelmed about being  in the shape I find myself - ROUND - and thought, ""Man, I gotta do that juice fast diet and change my fat habits.""\n\nSo I broke down and bought a juicer.\n\nBut not just ANY Juicer... No, no. I bought the OMEGA J8005 (five, five, five, five...I`m pretty sure when you say it, it`s supposed to BOOM and echo for a minute.)\n\nTook it outta the box and the first thing I noticed after the Angels stopped singing, was how securely it was packaged.\nFirst, the SHIPPING carton was the perfect size and shape for the RETAIL carton inside.\nSecond, inside the retail carton, the OMEGA J8005 (five, five, five, five) was expertly packaged. Every single piece and part was bubble wrapped and securely placed in the box.\nTaking it out and laying out all the pieces, I was thrilled to find it looked EXACTLY like the unit in all of the You Tube Videos that previous owners had made that I watched to decide upon buying this one.\n\nIt went together with ZERO difficulty.\nSeriously ZERO difficulty. If you have problems assembling this thing, STOP IMMEDIATELY and call someone smarter than you to do it, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG!\nThis thing is nearly idiot-proof!\nAlso, as an added bonus, the instruction manual is very clear to understand AND, for those of you who attended Missouri public school like me, has plenty of great pictures for step-by-step instructions.\n\nThere are four thousand and one reasons a Nutritionist, Dietician, M.D., or one of your friends who has been juicing for 10 years might tell you to buy a different brand or kind of juicer... They have really good reasons: Nutrient content, enzymes, temperature of juice and such... But for me it boiled down to this:\nA Vitamix costs as much as a kidney or an appendage.\nThe juicer Joe and Phil use in the movie was $100 more than this one.\nThe OMEGA J8005( five, five, five, five) was less expensive than the high-end juicers. MORE expensive than the cheapest OMEGA juicers, and had 300 positive reviews out of 330 or so... Guess what? TRIGGER PULLED AND with PRIME I got it here before I ordered it - SO FAST!\n\nNOW I'M JUICIN' IT UP! AWWWW YEAH!\n\nI stuffed it full of three bunches of Kale and some Celery this baby was begging for more! That's right. I juiced! I juiced GOOD AND LONG and nearly keeled over from a HUGE tummy ache... AND even though I was so into cramming every last solitary veggie from my crisper into my brand spankin' new OMEGA J8005 (five, five, five, five) and seeing how well it worked... I did two bad things... I let the juice container overflow (WHICH HOLDS FOUR CUPS up to the tippy tip top) AND I ran the juicer for - I dunno - like a hour straight (which if you're an instruction manual reader you would know is big ""No, No,"" because it says 30 minutes continuously MAX.\n\nI love my juicer. I don't care who knows it. I don't care if your juicer runs faster longer, jumps higher and can run for more than 30 minutes according to its manual. My juicer rocks.\n\nI'm very satisfied.\n\nOh, and it also makes noodles.\nSo if I lose a g'jillion pounds and can have spaghetti again, I'm gonna mash up some sauce and have you all over for an Italian feast.\n(Not really.)";Oh, OMEGA J8005... I LOVE YOU.
7;53.0;1.0;10.0;1050;This made juice great, but it would only work in reverse after just 45 days.  Also, it has a very small mouth to put the fruits and vegetables through.  Because the mouth is so small, it requires a lot more preperation in cutting and pushing through in order to make the juice.;Broke in less than 45 days
8;100.0;5.0;5.0;1065;I have only been juicing for 1 year.  Most of which was with a cheap Walmart juicer and fruit.  Then recently I found another cheap juicer at Sams Club.  It was actually quite a nice looking juicer and was an exact copy of a Breville JE98XL.  Since then I have been making green juices for breakfast (kind of hooked on them now).  I love the energy that I get and the well being of juicing.  The one thing I didn't like was all the waste. The top feed high speed juicers all seem to leave pulp quite wet.  I have tried re running the pulp before only to end up with a gooey mess.  They are fast and convenient but what a waste of food.  They always left me feeling like I didn't get all the juice I could out of what ever I put into it.  Then there is the nutritional value that you are trying to get from the food which the high speed and heat reduce.  Seems counter intuitive doesn't it a bit?\n\n  So I have never used a masticating juicer and read other reviews of this product.  The reviews I have seen seemed a little mixed so I was sort of scared to make this purchase.  The reviews lean more toward the better end of the spectrum however.  The issue I see is that no matter what you get into the price for something superb is always more than I want to pay.  It doesn't seem to matter what the product is some snobbery is expected.  So with that I hope those are all outliers.  I just received the product today as well so some of what I have to say could be prejudice.\n\n  I unpacked the item and really it seems more than solid.  Everything seems very well constructed but only time will tell.  The motor is quiet, not dead quiet but nothing like what other machines sound like.  When its grinding up food it sounds like its crunching away in an almost comical way.  The pulp comes out the end very dry.  I know my rabbit loves the pulp usually this she is not even touching.  So I know its dry too dry for her.  Also it comes with two containers one for the pulp and one for the juice.\n\n  The results, well let me first say the juice I made is not unique.  I used to make this all the time so I know the exact taste from the other machine.  With this it was greener and cooler actually down right cold when it came out.  I always wash my vegetables then leave then in cold water right up till I start making them into juice.  Usually when the juice comes out its almost room temperature with the other machine.  The process with this is more extensive but not that overly laborious.  I had to cut my apples into 8 instead of 4 and cucumbers into 4.  This doesn't seem like a big deal to me.  Also this juice can be stored in a dark container with no loss of vitamins which is a huge plus.  The taste is amazing.  It was so much better than I have had before.  That alone made up for the cost difference.\n\n  The clean up is not bad either.  I was able to pull everything apart fairly easy and really it cleans easier than my other machine.  I can almost never get everything out of the metal strainers.  I think in all it has the same amount of parts to clean as a top feed juicer.  I agree these are not for everyone as its difficult at times to get everything down the shoot.  In all though for the taste and nutrients this is well worth it.  Now just to hope that it endures.  My Walmart juicer broke in a year and the Sams club juicer is now going to be a gift.  So that is really my only concern.\n\n*** update ***\n  I have had this now for around 6 months.  I really don't see it breaking or that it looks like it has had use.  It seems to be very well built and I don't see how it wouldn't last.  Of course I don't use it as much as I did up front.  I still make around one juice a week or so.  My favorite drink so far has been cucumber, carrot and sometimes a beet or ginger in the mix.  For green juices I think this is a good way to go.;Maybe a bit premature...
9;28.0;4.0;18.0;1098;This is an excellent juicer for green vegetable juice. Fruits don't juice very well. The fruit pulp will tend to clog the screen and you will have to stop and rinse the screen. It will remove a good amount of juice from fruit but it is a chore. Because it will not juice fruit very well is the reason I gave it only 4 stars. That is a con. Another con is the feed tube size, it is only a little over 1  inches in diameter. I have found if I julienne all the hard veggies and chop all the leafy greens and mix it all together before I feed it through it works much better. Those are the cons and what prevents this juicer from being a 5 star because let me tell you how wonderful the juice is if you go through that little bit of work.\nIf prepped properly the veggies go through without problem and no clogging. I can make a gallon of green juice without cleaning the screen! I buy all my produce and make my juice the same day yielding the freshest and highest quality juice. This juicer produces very little foam and minimal oxidization occurs when I store it in mason jars for 3 days. I even drank the last jar on the fourth day and it tasted fine. The flavors mellow as it ages (probably not a good thing) but I can tell it still packs a very nutritional punch even after 3 days in the fridge. I do this because I am a full time student and I work part time. Juicing every fourth day saves me so much time. It takes me less than 3 hours to wash, prep, juice, and clean up my machine and mess.\nI am taking in so many servings and varieties of vegetables I would normally never consume. My green juice recipe includes cucumber, celery, carrots, parsley, spinach, kale, chard, watercress, asparagus, apple, and lemon. I was sure it was going to taste nasty but I love it! It is very energizing like a natural energy drink.\nI have lost 22 lbs in 16 days eating mostly raw vegetable and fruit. I have more energy and I feel healthier. I am convinced this is a much better way to live. By being an example for my girlfriend she is now starting to juice. My kids even try my juice but prefer the fruit juices. If you are interested just check out youtube and you will find tons of help.\nI bought the Breville blender on Amazon for my fruit. I make fresh fruit smoothies with almond milk in the blender and juice my veggies. So far it has been an amazing journey and I invite you to try it out yourself.;Great juicer! I highly recommend for green juice.
10;67.0;1.0;8.0;1111;"I bought this juicer after reading lots of reviews thinking the bad ones are just coincidental. I went into Wheatgrass wholeheartedly, growing trays and trays of it, reading a book and articles, and thought I need a durable machine I can extract all that quantity and get the best quality in the most convenient way. So the price of little over 250 did not deter me.\nFrom day 1, I began hearing cracking noises and thought this is how it is supposed to be since I did not see any physical signs of damage on the parts.\nCleaning it though is not really that easy because it takes time and lots of water! 5 parts to clean, and the filter s the hardest one (to thoroughly clean all the wheatgrass residue). Taking all that into account doesn't make juicing wheatgrass a whole lot of fun.\nAfter about a month of using it, when took out the parts for cleaning as I do every morning, I realized what had happened: The black cone that holds the screen/filter cracked in several places in line with the filter nudges that hold it into that cone - about 2,3 cracks across the cone. This is caused by pressure of masticating the grass into the screen. So all those ""benefits"" of the machine supposedly juicing carrots, root vegetables, etc, I can't imagine it would really hold through it without breaking.\nIt has also jammed a couple of times by having the wheatgrass wrapped around the auger so I had to take it apart and release it. In short this is more laborious than it should be. This is clearly a flaw in design!\n\nI contacted the company because I intended to keep the machine and have them maybe ship a newly designed piece (hoping they know it's a design flaw). Never heard back from them. I guess they know about the problem, and will replace the same piece only to those unfortunate who get in touch with them and complain about this. This is a strategy of many companies; they will keep replacing whatever until the end of the warranty, then you are hung on to dry...I've decided, I am not going to be one of those, and returned it to Amazon.";Too expensive and very fragile
11;56.0;5.0;10.0;1122;I've owned this juicer for about a year.  It is the best juicer I've ever had for juicing leafy greens.  And green juices are where it's at!\n\nThere is no such thing as the perfect juicer for ALL juicing jobs.  And don't listen to anyone who says there is!  I own an inexpensive citrus juicer.  A centrifugal juicer for soft fruits such as melons.  And I have this one for juicing my leafy greens.  It juices all your greens, herbs, wheat grass ... so efficiently.\n\nHowever, this baby also juices apples, pears, beets, carrots, ginger, peppers, cucumber, celery, and fennel (anything firm) like a champ.\n\nThe chute is a little smaller in diameter than some other juicers, so I have to cut apples, pears, cucumbers, and beets into more narrow pieces to get them down the chute.  But it's a small price to pay for the EASY CLEANUP.  I can't tell you how easy this baby is to clean!  It comes with a heavy duty 'toothbrush' looking tool that is used to scrub the small screen clean in a flash.\n\nUsing this juicer makes me want to juice!  The slower, masticating design gives a higher juice yield.  And the super easy clean up is worth mentioning again.  It comes with everything you need including 2 nice size containers to catch the juice (with another screen which screens out any foam which is a nominal amount) and the dry pulp.  Tip: put a produce bag in the pulp container for an even easier clean up.  And what you're left with is no foam juice.  (My containers are not made of cheap materials.  I don't put them in the dishwasher.  I wash them by hand immediately after juicing and I've never had a problem.)\n\nI've also used the blank side to make 'ice cream' using frozen bananas and strawberries.  Yum!  You can also make nut butters, but I'm losing weight and nut butter aren't currently on my diet plan.  Can't wait until they are!\n\nSuper smart design.  The 15 year warranty on this baby, for the price?  You can't beat it.\n\nUPDATE:  It's now 2014, and I'm still using it ... all the time.  Still love it.  It runs like a champ and is still great for green juicing.  And we're still making the frozen banana and strawberry soft serve 'ice cream.';Great Juicer for Leafy Greens!
12;68.0;2.0;8.0;1131;This juicer produced some amazing juice when it worked...I received this juicer on Wednesday November 28, and immediately I wanted to try it out, so I went out and bought some carrots and apples to try and it produced some amazing crisp tasty and foam free juice..it assembled very easy and the instruction was straight forward.. Cleanup was simple and quick.. Thursday November 29th I decided to try some spinach, kale, beets, pineapples, and apples.. It worked perfectly again.. I was sold!!! Then Friday November 30th my wife and I decided to go on a juice fast for the weekend from Friday to Monday at 12:00 noon, so I go to our grocer  and purchased $35 work of organic fruits and vegetables.. We wash and chopped them and at the beginning of juicing the carrots the motor of the juicer started making loud noises.. I turn the machine off and clean the parts and reassembled it.. But it didn't help and I started smelling something burning.. So I hit reverse and disassembled and reassemble again but it didn't help... So I decided  to return... I really like this product and will buy another I just hope it work ...;Product Malfunction
13;87.0;4.0;6.0;1131;I've owned this juicer for about 6 weeks now and have juiced fruits in it and many many vegetables and it has juiced everything that I've fed into it albeit not all with the same effeciency. If you are looking for a juicer to juice leafy greens this is your machine. It will eat through kale, lettuce, spinach with a vengence. The pulp is dry and the juice is good. This machine also shines with harder root vegetables as well like carrots.\n\nWhere it struggles is with softer fruits and vegetables.  I juice a lot of cucumber, however if I don't push through the occasional celery stalk it will start to back up. The same thing occurs with softer fruits. I did try juicing some oranges in it, which it did juice.  However I would have been better off cutting the oranges in half and squeezing them into a glass!  If you push through some more fibrous stuff while you are juicing the softer fruits and vegetables you won't have any problems.\n\nOne last thing. This juicer does produce a good amount of pulp. It comes with a strainer which I use while I am juicing. However, because of this it does slow down the process a bit when it becomes clogged.  I do though because I don't like much pulp in my vegetable juice. On the plus side it doesn't produce much foam.\n\nRegarding setting up and cleaning, it takes very little time.  I can have it set up and juicing in under a 30 seconds. While it takes me around 5-7 minutes to clean everything after I have finished.\n\nAll in all I am very happy with the machine. It seems very sturdy and solidly built and comes with that 10 year warranty which brings a bit of consumer confidence to the table.;Good for the greens
14;88.0;4.0;6.0;1137;I am a big time researcher and spent over a month checking out juicers. I narrowed my search down to a masticating juicer since I wanted to juice greens, including wheatgrass. I had not juiced before so everything was kind of foreign to me so I kind of felt like I was taking a stab in the dark. But, after all of the great reviews I was hoping to not be disappointed. The juicer has not let me down. I juiced everything and it goes without a hitch. I have enjoyed many wonderful juices and have now had the juicer for over a year. One small complaint is that the large, main plastic container got a superficial crack in it the first month after purchase. It does not affect the juicer at all, but it is a little but of a bummer. All in all though, great juicer!!!;Great Masticating Juicer
15;49.0;5.0;11.0;1150;"Please don't hurry out to buy the least expensive juicer just to see if juicing is ""right for you."" Borrow a cheap one, realize you hate the taste of foamy, broken down (watery mixed with pulp and foam) juice and THEN go invest in a slow rotating, single auger, masticating juice extractor. Fast is NOT best when it comes to extracting fruit and vegetable juice! Fast simply destroys the enzymes and nutrients while spraying a mess all over your kitchen. Not fun!\n\nNow, why we LOVE this little horizontal, slow rotating beast. You get MORE juice from each piece of fruit or veggie you use. The pulp comes out bone dry and I've seen how we use much less produce than our friends who juice with the centrifugal style juicer. The juice is smooth, not broken down from the high speed of the other juicers. And the foam is minimal and easy to skim if you need, but we find there's simply not enough to worry about.\n\nMoney-wise, we paid just under $200 for this since we bought is ""like new"" used. Best decision we made was the use the ""used"" feature here on Amazon since it came in like new condition with a significant savings. And for twice the price of the other juicers, it's given us more than twice the value in juice quality, savings in amount of produce used and here's the clincher for me.... it takes 3 (yes T-H-R-E-E) minutes to clean. It's SO nice not to spend 20 minutes cleaning up the mess other juicers create. This alone makes the difference in price worth every penny.\n\nOur kids (8, 7 and 5) all like the juices we create, even those heavy in veggies. So it's completely family-friendly.";Slow is the way to go!

At the end of my 3rd juicing session, the screen broke.  I contacted Omega via email for warranty replacement, and never heard anything.  When I called them, I experienced ""longer than normal hold times"" before I finally got to a human that told me yes, my replacement order was in the system (thanks for telling me!) and that the screens were backordered and expected ""next week"".  It's now two weeks later, and I still don't have a screen.  I called again, and after three calls where I was hung up on as I was being connected (didn't sound like a connection problem; it sounded like a person picking up, then hanging up, a handset), I was told that the screens are still backordered and expected ""next week"".

I am so sorry I ever bought this!  Because of a health condition it is really important I get the 5 fruits and vegetables a day so thought this would be a great way to accomplish that!  So thought it important to spend a little more money on a good machine; however, this machine is a piece of junk!  It gives you very little juice out of the fruit, and is a mess, gets clogged very easy and ends up being more time than anything to get maybe 2 or 3 servings out of what would be considered 5 servings.  I have only had this for 4 months and am already having problems with it.  I am obviously going to have to buy a new one so this will just be written off as a bad investment!";Waste of money piece of junk
19;57.0;5.0;10.0;1253;"WHOA! I was skeptical about buying a new juicer. There are SOOOOO many different kinds and brands and BLEH. I researched for MONTHS. There were a few things that lead me to this little beauty...\n\n1. Customer service from the negative reviews seemed that Omega actually helps their buyers. Not one review I read for breville said they even replaced one part upon breaking during or before the first use.\n\n2. Lots of fitness leaders have recommended this exact model and put their life on it.\n\n3. It does not damage the nutrients with oxidation or heat.\n\n4. You can make pasta, frozen yogurt, nut butters with it.\n\n5. I mostly wanted one for leafy greens. DONE. :)\n\nThis works SO awesome. I cut up a whole variety of fruits and vegis. Put them in randomly. The pulp is dry. The juice flavor is AWESOME. It comes out with so much more flavor than any of my previous juicers. (Be careful with Ginger root.) I would suggest using HALF of what you're used to with the ginger.\n\nVery easy clean up.\n\n**Who ever said you can not juice wheat grass in this machine... Is the kind of person causing us have stickers on ovens and curling irons that says ""Caution: Do NOT touch. This is HOT."" Using the little brain God gave us, we CAN juice all leafy greens in this Omega. Quite beautifully. :)";LOVE.
20;69.0;5.0;8.0;1257;I decided a month or so ago to start juicing to lower my cholesterol and add more micro nutrients into my diet. After a lot of research, I decided on this juicer. We also really looked into the Breville, but stuck with the Omega.\n\nI am so thrilled we did. Having used a breville at a friend's house I was acquainted with its functions. We eat a lot of fruit, so buying a juicer that was better for pulpy fruits was not as important. I knew going in that I needed a juicer that really extracted juice from the greens and was easy to clean. This Omega fits the bill perfectly. I get a massive amount of juice out for my efforts. I get 25-30 ounces of juice with 6 carrots, 2 apples, 2 celery stalks, a handful of spinach, and 3 large pieces of kale. That is HUGE!!! I couldn't be happier.;AmAZing juicer, especially for greens
21;78.0;5.0;7.0;1267;My wife and I have a Breville juicer and we did a side by side comparison and this gets a lot more juice out of the greens than the Breville.  I also use with frozen bananas to make ice cream and it works great!!  Yummy :)  You do have to do more prep and cutting with your vegatables since the feeding tube is smaller than on the Breville, but literally when we juiced the same things in both juicers, the omega juice was green and the Breville was orange.;Great Juicer, I can't believe how much juice it gets out of the greens!
22;107.0;5.0;5.0;1273;not much of a juicer personally, but I wanted to try a cleanse. This bad boy destroyed everything it came in contact with including lettuce and kale. Seems to juice everything just fine and really easy to clean.\n\nNot much else to say. Five Stars;better then expected
23;110.0;5.0;5.0;1332;I'm very pleased with my purchase. I felt concerned about spending this amount, but really wanted a masticating juicer and this one was highly rated. I am not disappointed. It is very easy to clean and since it is also beautiful, I don't mind keeping it out on my counter. The result is that I juice every day. I had a centrifugal juicer and did not use it much because of how much clean up was needed afterword. Plus, the amount of plup produced was intimidating to my small garbage. This masticating juicer, however, produces much more juice and the amount of plup is much less. So I don't have a full garbage after each juice. I have been juicing a lot of wheat grass, carrots and beets mostly.  It juices the wheat grass easily and wonderfully.;Excellent
24;71.0;4.0;8.0;1341;"Here's my honest opinion about the Omega J8005 Juicer that I received 4/30/2012.\n\nI'm about 90% happy with it and it's my very first juicer.  The 10% of dissatisfaction is the size of the hopper.  It is rather small and you have to do a little extra prep on the veggies and fruit.  But when you think about it, it's a single gear juicer operating at a slower RPM so shoving a whole apple or chunk of beet might gum things up a bit anyway.\n\nI have tried a good variety of veggies and fruit and I agree with other reviewers:  If you have a softer fruit/veg (tomato, orange) , then follow up with a harder one (carrot) to push the softer stuff through.\n\nSo far, the juice has been cold if the ingredients come from the fridge.  I haven't noticed any overt heating of the juice by the machine.  Not too much clogging of the screen or clogging period.  Clean up is indeed a breeze.\n\nI have had it for about a week and have not had any trouble with the auger so far.  I juice for 1-2 people and it seems to handle the load with no problem.  I'll follow up in about 6 months to let you guys know if it's still running problem-free.\n\nFor the price, I'm not disappointed.  I read alot of reviews out there and not one juicer has 100% likes on it that I've seen.  I think you have to bear in mind when you're buying a juicer to take into account the size of family you're juicing for, the amount of money you want to part with, and differentiating between the ""must have"" features and the ""would-like"" features and find a happy middle ground.\n\nWould I have liked to give the $1000 juicer a try.  Absolutely.  Could I afford it?  Absolutely not.  So there you have it, this is my ""compromise"" juicer and so far it's doing what I need it to do.  Hope this helps.  Ask me a question and I'll try to answer.";Honest Review by a Working Mom
25;80.0;5.0;7.0;1342;I guess the first question you would need to ask is why a masticating juicer? The distinction is that a masticating juicer operates at a lower speed than other juicers, protecting your veggies/fruit from heat generated oxidation/foam, which also serves to deliver a higher percentage of its nutrients, since they too are affected by that self same generated heat. Another nice feature is that a masticating juicer allows more pulp and fiber through, which means your juices retain more of their essential healthiness/nutrients, basically. There is also less waste than with centrifugal juicers or even with blenders.\nThis particular juicer is a workhorse. We use it daily, and also employ its talents as a coffee grinder. We haven't made pasta with it yet, although that remains a tantalizing option which we will explore soon (and i will update this when we do). We have had zero issues with its durability yet (it has now been 5 months since i bought it). It is a solid, well built machine, and i am very, very glad to have purchased it.\n\nEnjoy!;This was a great buy and one of my favorite kitchen appliances
26;65.0;5.0;9.0;1348;"I read ALL the reviews, extensively, before selecting this juicer.  Like most everyone else, buying this was a result of having watched ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"".  So even though he uses the faster kind in the film, I decided I wanted every drop of nutrition I could get out of this Juice Fast deal.  So after agonizing over this, we got the Omega J8005.  It is an AMAZING machine.  Let me just tell you the REAL truth:  It is NOT slow;  it did not take long to make the juice.  You chop the veggies and fruits into pieces about the size of a cell phone, but maybe a bit narrower.  It does help a lot to do the ""wetter"" stuff and then put through something rougher to clear the channel.\n\nAs far as cleaning, after reading all these people griping about it being a pain ~ IT IS NOT TRUE!!!  THIS JUICER IS SUPER EASY TO CLEAN!  I am not lying to you.  It takes almost NO time at all.  It's a BRILLIANT design.  No food got stuck anywhere.  And I used this thing BIG TIME, it is so un-intimidating I was shocked, after reading so many people pick it apart.\n\nI wanted to write this so that people who were considering would know, you can NOT go wrong choosing this one.  It is worth the extra money.  We found absolutely NO flaws in it.";Best of all juicers
27;81.0;5.0;7.0;1351;"I have been researching juicers for years, literally.  All my friends have given me their opinions saying theirs was hard to clean, hard to use, too much of a pain  so they never took it out of the box, etc.  NOT SO WITH THE OMEGA!  I couldn't wait to get it.  Took it out of the box, put it together barely looking at the manual (which is no small feat for me!  I can't put anything together usually!)\n\nJuicing is easy and quiet, clean up is a breeze, takes me no more than 2 minutes.  But the best part of all is that you KNOW you're doing something for your health; you're getting the highest quality centrifugally pressed juice that preserves all the vitamins and enzymes.  I have juiced twice a day, every day since I received my juicer just over a month ago.  I juice mainly organic carrots and apples together, but this morning I threw in some fresh grapefruit and pineapple.  I have done tomatoes, carrots, cilantro, peppers - DELICIOUS!  I have noticed two specific health issues disappear since I began juicing and looking forward to more health benefits yet.  Even my kids are getting into it; my 16-yr old told me she craves the juice when she goes a day without it.  Way better than her telling me she's craving french fries!\nI would buy this juicer over and over; I don't have any desire to try a different one because this one has been perfect for me!";Could NOT be more happy with my juicer!
28;73.0;5.0;8.0;1365;"I would say that understanding why, what, and how to juice are a big part of the equation.  When I first purchased this unit I was attempting to juice all of one item and my results were not always great.  I also was a little dejected that this unit was not super fast chewing through produce like a buzz saw.\n\nMy perspective has changed now that I have been juicing daily for the last 7 months.  Most days I make about 2 quarts of juice.  First of all, the Omega 8005 has held up GREAT!  I have learned the recipes that I like.  I know how to prep my veggies and fruit so that everything is clean and the correct size for the fastest process.  I have also learned that this juicer, while not the fastest speed at only 80 rpms, yields a bunch of juice with a minimum amount of foam and pulp.\n\nI forgot to mention my clean up is minimal, maybe two minutes tops.  There is only two small areas that have metal screens that require the brush.  The rest just takes a quick rinse.  My whole daily routine takes about 20 minutes.  That averages to about 3 oz of juice per minute (wash, prep, juice, and clean up).  Just for the record, I don't drink all 60 oz by myself.  My family likes my juice so I had to start making more!  It all gets consumed within 20 minutes of being made though.\n\nI would make this purchase again!!  Like others of said, it is fun at times.  Now for my single remaining complaint.  The 8006 model has better bins (pour spout and maybe larger capacity) and is recessed on the front unit to accommodate the different shape.  I would have loved to have those bins with my 8005.  It also has an auger that is black/grey instead of white.  After 15 months, mine has some discoloration from the veggie juice.  It still looks good though.\n\nVERT envy? Nope.  I have looked at many, many VERT reviews and videos.  I could have purchased that unit but I am glad I did not.  My unit takes more work to feed the veggies in, unlike the VERT which is almost self-feeding on some veggies, but I never have to stop in the middle of juice to clean the unit.  If a softer item starts to clog the 8005, I just feed through a harder veggie to clean everything out.  No problem!\n\nUpdate July 2012\n\nOK VERT envy did strike.  I had the opportunity to purchase the VERT 350 HD and put it up agaist my 8005.  I will just say the VERT worked ok if you prepped your striny veggies in short pieces (celery, kale, etc) and made sure your carrots were not thicker than 1/2"".  If not, it would Jam and you quickly loose all time savings.  In all cases, the juice from the VERT had more pulp!  Unless you like spoonfuls of pulp, the VERT is not a good choice.  I just sold my VERT and I am back to just the Omega 8005.";After 15 months, still very happy!
29;112.0;1.0;5.0;1366;Keep shopping, I do not recommend this product as it is lacking in quality. The grinding component is plastic, it is slow, and it has a very small hole to put your fruits and veggies in. I had to quarter carrots lengthwise to juice.

32;82.0;5.0;7.0;1396;I ordered this juicer looking for a great way to add nutrition that our family of 7 would actually enjoy consuming,  I knew it had to be this type because it was supposed to be better for greens than centrifugal juicers and we want greens! First of all, it came a day BEFORE the earliest I was expecting it on super saver shipping!  Hooray amazon! We didn't waste a second and opened it right up.  It went together in a second and I've never seen, much less put one together before....so hooray omega for a simple design!  We started juicing right away with tons of kale, baby spinach, parsley, celery, beets, carrots, apples and pear.  It went right through everything.  We had to actually follow the idea of alternating soft and hard produce, which everything tells you (including the manual) and that allowed the juice to keep on flowing! I don't mind prepping the produce because I scrub it anyway....then I just give it a chop, stick it in a green bag when it's dry and I'm good to go for a few days! I just leave he apples and pears for fresh cutting.  I don't have to stuff lots of stuff down with the plunger, it does a great job just chewing it up with occasional pressure from the plunger or another piece of produce.  It's way quieter than a centrifugal juicer and it's way lighter too.  It doesn't take up anywhere near the amount of room on the counter I thought it would and it's so much safer with 5 little ones in the house since there aren't any blades! My kids love helping me make juice...handing the produce to whoever has the turn to put it down the Shute.  We all love it and feel the difference juicing at least once a day for snack has made in our bodies and energy.  We are SO glad we decided to give this juicer a try.  We're never looking back!;My fears relieved!
33;114.0;5.0;5.0;1400;"I am still in love with this juicer after owning & using it for over 5 months. It's very easy to set up & very easy to clean up for a non-technical person as myself. I hand-wash the parts just about every time. I debated giving this juicer 4 stars instead of 5 for the reason that you have to cut the pieces a bit smaller than for other juicers. BUT, for the kind of masticating juicer this is, I think the machine's input design is optimal for good output, which is most important. Some other things I love about this juicer:\n\n1. The 10-year warranty.\n2. The flexibility to make pasta, bread, peanut butter, or emulsify ingredients for yogurts, etc. I've actually made whole wheat & spinach noodles with this machine thanks to the noodle mold(s).\n3. The motor never touches my food. It's an entirely primitive process except for how effective it is.\n4. The pulp is sufficiently dry & I compost that.\n5. My juice is the same temp from start to finish.\n6. I can leave the motor resting on the counter-top without it taking up much space.\n7. It's not obnoxiously loud (IMHO).\n8. My children can help juice & I'm not afraid they will lose fingers.\n9. Haven't thrown anything at it it can't handle.\n\nSomething to consider...If you're juicing for 1-2 people every morning, this is a more ideal machine for you between the prep & required time. Manufacturer's recommendation is not running it for more than 30 min straight. To me, it's an incredibly sturdy machine which is what makes it commercial quality, not for the high production factor. Can 'process' greater amounts of pasta or the like for freezing.\n\nEdit: As others have said, I bought this juicer after watching ""Fat, Sick, & Nearly Dead"" which I highly recommend. Found on Netflix & Amazon Prime streaming.";Perfect juicer for our family
34;36.0;1.0;16.0;1433;This item was purchased as a Christmas gift.  When opened, the recipient discovered the plastic covering for the motor housing was cracked.  The company requested the defective unit be returned and they shipped a replacement.  It arrived with the same defect, as did the second and third replacements.  For the fourth replacement, the company is sending a different model.  It is scheduled to arrive tomorrow.\n  The compay has shipped via different carriers to see if that is their problem.  It hasn't made any difference.  It appears there is a materials problem with the plastic cover and  perhaps also package design issues.\n  If you plan to buy this item, I suggest you go to a store where you can inspect it prior to the purchase.;fallsman
35;96.0;3.0;6.0;1435;So i ordered this during the Amazon special and altho there is much difference between the j8004/j8005/j8006 it both does its job the same way. With a few minor cosmetic looks on each machine and the most important part.. the auger on the j8005.\n\nWhen i start masticating soft veggies such as spinach, kales leaves, and other leafy greens, juice gets stuck inside the tube area where its suppose to be pushed out. After reading numerous reviews and forums about the j8005, it seems the issue has to do with the Auger. The Auger was made of different material from the j8004/j8006. The j8006 auger seems to be made of more sturdy material and less toxic which is an issue in the j8005 machine.\n\nAltho the units all function the same way.. a simple issue such as the auger made a huge difference in how juice came out. I partically didn't like how wet pulp was always stuck to the auger on the j8005 and it always caused a MESSY clean up and loss of product effectiveness. If you do get a good deal on this, do yourself a favor and replace the auger on this thru omegajuicer.com.. unfortunately, it cots $60 to replace it.;Pulp gets stuck on Auger
36;97.0;5.0;6.0;1451;The juicer arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon's great service.  It came already assembled and I started juicing immediately.....first time juicer right here.  So far I'm getting great results.  I've juiced carrots, apples, cilantro, kale, celery, beets, ginger, cucumber, spinach and broccoli.  I get juice with minimal foam on top.  No more buying juice from Central Market since purchasing the Omega.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers have commented, I did have to cut up things but I don't mind.  The ease of cleaning is very true.  Within minutes I'm done with the clean-up.  I wondered what to do with the pulp, and finally decided to taste it one day and I liked it.  So now I also eat the pulp.  I just add fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of sea salt.  It may not be for everyone, but I like it.;My First Juicer!
37;61.0;4.0;10.0;1453;"I've owned the Omega J8005 juicer for about a week and am very pleased with it.  I'll update after I've used it a while.\n\nPros: Very good w/ greens, easy assembly and disassembly, relatively quiet, easy cleaning, great warranty (10 years), and looks.\n\nCons: Slower at juicing than a centrifugal juicer, doesn't handle the really tough fruits like pineapple w/ skin, have to cut the plants into small sizes to fit into the hopper, slightly less juice from carrots and apples than my Breville.\n\nIt's a masticating juicer which means it tears, mashes, and presses the plant matter with an auger to separate the juice and fiber. I've found that it provides more juice from leafy green veggies (kale, dandelion, spinach etc.) than my Breville Elite 800JEXL. The Omega is relatively quiet as well.  I can carry on a conversation or listen to the radio while juicing. It cleans very easily - some running water, a quick brush around the parts with a little soap, and a drain board is all I need. The Omega's assembly and disassembly are also very easy - it takes about 10-15 seconds.  For videos of these juicers in action go to YouTube and check out ""rawfood's"" videos.  BTW, I haven't yet used it for pasta or nut butters (which apparently the Omega can process).\n\nGiven that it's a masticating juicer and not a centrifugal juicer (one that has a very fast spinning blade plate that spins around and rips the plants apart) it's slower at juicing. Compared to my Breville, it takes about 5 times as long to juice carrots and 4 times as long to juice greens like kale. Not only does the Breville tear though the plants faster than the Omega, the hopper is also about 2.5 times the size so you can fit more in at a time. And though it has a powerful motor, the design of the Omega isn't built to handle really tough plants like skin-on pineapple.\n\nIn summary, the Omega will probably be my more used juicer because I prefer a heavily 'green' juice, it's easier to clean, is quieter, and I'll be more likely to just make a glass or two with it as the mood strikes me.  On the other hand, I'll use the Breville for when I want to juice larger quantities and/or use harder/tougher veggies & fruits.\n\nAdvice: if you want more greens and softer fruits/veg, make smaller quantities (8-32 oz at a time), live in a space where you need really quiet, then the Omega may be a better option.  However if you really like carrot, apple, turnip, pineapple juice, and/or want to make a couple liters for the day, then a centrifugal juicer like the Breville may be a better option.\n\nHere's to your health!";Very Pleased
38;75.0;4.0;8.0;1453;"I haven't seen too many reviews where people put up specific quantitative information so I wanted to put up some numbers (for people like me!)\n\nA friend of mine and I recently purchased this juicer after looking at reviews, websites, tv shows, etc etc on juicing.  My mother also has a Jack LaLanne which really got me interested in buying my own (after watching ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"").\n\nThis review will be brief as I think many others have already discussed build quality, appearance, the company itself, etc.  I want to focus on just a couple points.\n\n1.- The chute is rather small.  This seems to be the case on most juicers of this type because of the speed of the motor and auger type.  That being said, if you cut up your items before juicing to an appropriate size, it is easy to use.  If not, it is quite frustrating, as my first experience became.  So a couple extra seconds, literally, of prep time will save quite a bit of effort while juicing.\n\n2.- Clean up is a Breeeeeze! Especially compared to cleaning the blades and screens of a centrifugal juicer!\n\n3.- What do I juice?\n\nThis is an important aspect of any review and I don't think enough people discuss this specifically when they state opinions. The point of juicing to me is nutrients, not taste (which usually equals calories).  Yes, lots of fresh orange juice, apple juice, etc tastes great, and if it fits into your macros (macronutrient intake for the day) go for it!  Otherwise, a sugar (even fructose) laden beverage that tastes good, can still be high in sugar/overall calories.  Taste to me is a non-issue when I'm juicing.  The nutrients I'm getting make any juice tolerable.  I also don't mind pulp.  Why would you want to take out the pulp? It is part of the nutritive content of the food.\n\nToday's Juice (all are before chopping and including rind):\n98g Lemon\n24g Ginger\n208g Broccoli\n84g Romaine\n130g Cucumber\n64g Blueberries\n100g Cranberries\n52g Celery\n150g Carrot\n178g Apple\n\nTotal weight was 1088g\nYield was 668g (water is 1g per mL, so about 668mL) or approximately 61%\n\nI would point out that certain squishy things like blueberries are probably better blended than juiced, but this is what I have so they get thrown in with everything else!\n\nAdditional things I use (but was out of today):\nspinach\nmango\ngrapefruit\nkale\n\nI LOVE this juicer for greens (kale, spinach, romaine) the centrifugal juicer is no match what so ever there.  Of course the centrifugal works better for the soft fruits, but not so much so that I would stick with it over this one.\n\nOne final note, I personally have yet to find ANY quantitative data on the supposed ""oxidation"" of nutrients or the increase in enzymes/nutrients you get from a masticating juicer versus the centrifugal.  Juicing in any fashion HAS to be better than not juicing.  So if you start there you are already ahead of the game :)";Quantitative information on a great juicer
39;37.0;1.0;16.0;1456;Omega used to be THE juicer brand, and we waited for a good sale to invest in one. Well, we were very disappointed. First, they now make the units in Korea - Omega used to be made in the USA. This model, now made in Korea, is VERY cheap. It's all plastic parts, even the base was a cheap plastic with chrome finish. The chute could barely fit a full carrot or celery stick in it - EVERYTHING has to be chopped up or dissected in order to fit. To juice an orange, you have to put in individual orange segments! The juice and pulp cups are also extremely tiny and made of cheap plastic that probably contain BPA. This juicer really looks like a child's toy and we laughed in total disbelief when we unpacked the box. This one just isn't for us.;You're kidding, right? The new face of Omega juicers :-(
40;25.0;5.0;26.0;1462;For the past year i have used a Breville juicer....and it has served me well. My biggest issue with Breville was that it didn't do much with greens. A handful of spinach would give me at most 2 1/2 tablespoonfuls, and  i could see whole leaves in the pulp. I read many product reviews before deciding to purchase. Most negative complains centered around cleaning, clogging,  and time spent juicing.\n\nI just tried out my Omega and i am in looove with it!!.\n\nMy first recipe had celery/spinach/parsley .....first of all i had no idea i could get that much juice from these veggies (12oz), the juice is very very bright green and tasty. The pulp was dry and there was no clogging. My next recipe was 2 green apples/kale.....i can only describe the taste as very vibrant and very green. I decided to juice a grape fruit to see if i would experience any clogging issues.....none and again the taste was out of this world. Finally i decided to try carrots and i had no issues whatsoever and again great quality juice.\n\nCONS?...Prep time... the size of the hopper and the presence of the gear requires that you chop your veggies. For your harder vegetables i would recommend you chop them up in a food processor first. I plan to chop mine the night before in order to save time. It also is not a quick as a centrifugal juicer, but i guess that is why the quality of the juice is so much better.\n\nCLEANING?....very very easy to clean. Just run your tap and everything washes off. The screen is not  difficult to clean, just use the brush provided. If you have to dislodge any pulp from the screen, i would recommend that instead of scrubbing the interior, scrub the exterior of the screen as you are running your tap. It took me less than 5 minutes to clean everything up. If for any reason you lose the provided brush or it loses its cleaning mojo....a toothbrush works just fine.\n\nEASE OF USE... Read the manual first and everything will fall into place. It is very easy to assemble and use.\n\nGREAT BUY!!!\n\nUPDATE\n\nThousands  of gallons of juice later...my Omega still works great.

42;99.0;4.0;6.0;1487;We bought the juicer to grind our wheat grass up. It is almost as slow as doing it manually. It took more wheat grass to get an ounce than if you do it manually. There was also a lot of foam. I will use it for other juices, but will probably continue grinding the wheat grass by hand.;slow
43;24.0;3.0;27.0;1527;After much shopping I choose the Omega masticating juicer as the best product for the buck. I wanted a product that would handle wheat grass and garden herbs.  I received the J8005 and rushed to try it out  I was tired of doing wheat grass manually).  I cut the grass into small pieces and started Omega masticating and was excited as the juice poured out.  Excited until I heard a crack and snap and the system hung up. After dis-assembly I found that the back of the screen assembly, a 2nd plastic screen, was snapped off. This plastic part sits in a grove that keeps the whole screen assembly from rotating.  Man was I disappointed.  The machine seems great except for a poorly designed plastic part.  Maybe I got a defective one. I have repeatedly contacted the company and even got feedback from the sales manager, but no replacement part.  After many weeks and out of desperation I used golf club epoxy to stick the part back on and only use it for soft herbs.  Back to doing the wheat grass by hand.\nThe overall product seems good. But the horrible service and cheaply designed parts that I feel are doomed to break (a lot or torque on a narrow plastic rail) especially when using wheat grass makes this a one star or worse product and customer be warned product. Too bad, this is a basically good product with cheap parts (blame it on the Chinese manufacturer)and bad service (maybe it was just one defective part). For the almost 300$ price I should return it, but I'm crazy and making a better part just to prove a point (the philosophic and engineering aspect of the problems of being made in China with no oversight) and also to have a backup plan when the other parts break. It makes good pasta.\n\nKUDOS to Amazon...after I wrote the above review I received the replacement part... Ahhhh the beauty of ordering through Amazon and giving customer feedback.  So I'm upgrading my previous one star to three stars (I subtracted one star for the hassle)...its a good machine...as long as it is ordered through Amazon the customer is covered.;plastic parts that break but they replaced them

It did a terrible job of producing juice and (compared to my Omega J8005) the juice was terrible. If you do any research about juicing, you'll hear about oxidation. When you grind vegetables at a high RPM you introduce a lot of air into the juice. Putting my hand next to the exit spout on the Jack Lalane, you can feel air like a fan and juice splatters all over the place. Conversely, the Omega J8005 operates at a lower RPM. It slowly squeezes the vegetables the same way our teeth do when we chew. I'm not a chemist, and I can't really speak to how it affect the quality of nutrition, but the TASTE is phenomenal compared to the centrifugal extraction method. Carrot juice pours out of this thing in a stream of deliciousness leaving the pulp dry to the touch.\n\nAnother point is that you can often get more juice from this time, because you can run it through again. It just continues to squeeze more juice out. With a centrifugal extraction, juice is separated during the grinding process and you can only grind a vegetable once.";Much Better Taste, More Juice
45;101.0;5.0;6.0;1563;"Short and sweet review. I have only juiced wheatgrass, spinach and carrots, and only for a few weeks. No experience with other juicers, manual or otherwise.\n\nPROS\n\n- Low RPM's help ensure enzymes are not denatured.\n- Motor appears overbuilt. It is more than adequate for the task at hand.\n- Pulp is very dry and means efficient liquid extraction.\n- Although concerned w/ the plastic parts, I feel it is necessary as the unit needs a bit of ""flex"" as the auger turns. Auger is heavy for its size and well built.\n- Motor noise is very low, but the action of juicing the grass is louder than than the motor. Unit is MUCH quieter than a blender and IMO very acceptable. Just don't be surprised w/ the occasional squeal when juicing grass.\n- Price is high, but the 15 yr. warranty justifies the initial cost if you plan on juicing long-term.\n- Cleaning is very easy and very quick. Two min. tops using just grass, although carrots take a bit longer.\n\nCONS\n\n- Although I was aware of it before purchase, the chrome colored plastic housing is a bit of a let down considering the $259 price tag. Of course this has nothing to due w/ performance.\n- Sent in my warranty and it was returned to sender.  Address was correct and when I went to the website yesterday and tonight, I got a ""could not correct"" message. Hope this was a simple mistake/'net bug, but the big reason I bought this was because of the warranty. Hope this is resolved and will update when/if it is. For now, I will give Omega the benefit of the doubt.\n\nDo your due diligence and google the product before purchase as I did.  Reviews I discovered are favorable and warranty replacements seems easy.";I'm Happy
46;22.0;1.0;31.0;1572;the juicer itself is excellent and does exactly everything it is supposed to do. I found it easy to clean and it made great juice. But then the juicing screen broke last week and Omega's customer service is useless. If they even exist. No answers to my e-mail and they never answer the phone. They keep saying they are experiencing high volumes of calls please hold on and then finally they state to leave a message because no one is available. We only had it 6 months -that is ridiculous and we cannot find a juicing screen to replace it. So we just bought a Breville and I will see how that does. Do not waste your money - I am so upset that we cannot juice wheat grass anymore.;5 stars until it broke...
47;89.0;3.0;7.0;1580;The juicer is pretty good for greens and other things with turgor pressure.  One of the things I enjoy is that it eats down the greens pretty easily (sometimes) without the plunger needed.  If you have high turgor pressure grapes and apples and such, it does fine with juicing them, however, something without that turgor pressure would be blueberries.  What it does to blueberries is just make a big mess all over the secondary screen.  The secondary screen itself is nice to have, but also needs to be cleaned at least once in the middle of a juicing session for me.  Sometimes when I'm doing a lot of kale and broccoli and such, it will leave a green sludge on the bottom of the cup, that made it past the screen.  This is something I kept solely for a vacation house juicer.  After buying this one and using it for a while, I decided to step up the game and go with the Super Angel juicer and have to say, it's the bee's knees of juicers.  The Omega is alright, but the Super Angel really puts this one in the dust in comparison.  I don't know that I'd be willing to buy a Super Angel for a vacation house at that price, but for a primary daily juicer, it's totally worth buying the Super Angel if you have the means to do so, and bypass the Omega.  If you want to juice more mushy fruit, you may want a centrifugal juicer to do that job for you.;It's a good juicer for greens........

This juicer has changed my life, made my skin so much clearer and helped provide consistent energy for me and my girlfriend.  The Omega is super easy to clean; it takes 4 minutes and comes with a cleaning brush to help get off tough vegetable residue.  So far I've had no problem juicing the following: carrots, apples, pears, kale, oranges, grapefruit, ginger, beets, and radishes to name a few.\n\nI'd highly recommend this juicer to anyone.

No chrome anywhere! It is chrome colored PLASTIC.  There is no way this could be a commercial  juicer.\n\n*It started squeaking while making juice after 30 minutes of operation.\n\n*Pretty quiet for a juicer.\n\n*Great with wheat grass, apples and carrots.\n\n*Worthless with strawberries and mangoes.\n\n*The Auger fits very loosely into the machine which creates a wobble while operating. Makes the drum flex and gives the impression that it will break off.\n\n*WARRANTY of 10 years is worthless! It only covers ""defect of workmanship"". If you wear it out--tough luck.\n\n*I'm going to try it for a few more days, but I'm really leaning towards sending it back.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDay 3:  I have given this Juicer 1 more star. (from 2 stars, to 3 stars)\n\n*Very easy assemble and un-assemble for easy cleaning.\n\n*It is actually a lot of fun making juice.\n\n*The pulp is amazingly dry which means that this juicer is very efficient.(with the exception of mangoes, strawberries and other mushy fruit which really shouldn't be juiced at all)\n\n*Still concerned about this juicer being made of plastic. Even the AUGER is plastic.\n\n*This juicer is growing on me. I think I will keep it. The main reason being--the fact that this juicer is so simple and easy to clean. This makes me far less hesitant to use it every day. I love the juice it makes and the unlimited creative juicing possibilities.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDay 27:\n\nI have been using this juicer almost every day since purchasing it.\n\nConclusion: This is a good juicer. It's a keeper.";An honest review!
50;119.0;4.0;5.0;1607;"Review will change, I'm not used to juicing, this is my second juicer - the first lasting 3 juices - different brand, returned due to issues I had with it which may have been because I am a juice noob.\n\nArrived in 2 days, looks good. Read through the manual but did not see it listed which was the juice spout and which was the pulp spout. No biggie, learned quickly closest to the machine is the juice spout. Nothing epic as I had both cups under it, lost no juice.\n\nDay 1 - juiced up a thing of collard greens, 2 apples, most of a pack of carrots and a lot of spinach. Seemed less than awesome on collard greens, but I do not know how much juice they should produce. carrots, apples, spinach produced what I thought was the right amount of juice.\n\nCleanup went from 6:13 to 6:19 so maybe 6 minutes to clean the juicer, a cutting board, knife,clean up a spinach spill and a couple of drops of juice that were on the counter from moving the containers.\n\nDay 1 wishes - slightly larger intake tube, the thing can down a carrot easy, but a couple of the carrots I have were a little too big at the end and had to be sliced. Documentation that has the words ""juice comes out here"" with a little arrow pointing to the nearest thing. Suggestion on what to do with waste.\n\ndays 2-20\n\nWent on an all juice diet for a bit so I got a pretty hefty usage out of the thing lately. Things I have noticed:\n\n1. It is possible to jam a carrot in in such a way that it requires complete dis-assembly in order to continue. Once you do it you'll see how to avoid it ever again.\n2. The small hopper/chute will really trip you up on small leafy vegetables until you learn to wash them / keep them wet while juicing... they'll annoy you, so wash them\n3. Putting large amounts in all at once will result in juice squirting out the pulp side. So limit your cramming stuff in - just the design can only handle x amount per second as it has to drop back\n4. It's easier to dump the pulp into a sink and scoop it out than it is to deal with positioning the pulp bucket if you're doing more than a glass of juice.\n5. The juicer is slow... it's thorough, but slow.\n6. Clean up time is about 6 minutes on average for me - this includes the cutting board, knife, everything on the juicer, and wherever I managed to spill something.\n7. Since there's 6 minutes to every juicing, I go ahead and juice a couple of juices in advance and toss the juice in the fridge. I know that loses some of the nutrients, but having 2 extra juices ready keeps me juicing as opposed to thinking ""I don't want to spend another 20 minutes juicing"".\n\nSo far the thing functions like I thought it would. I have decided after reading a lot of reviews that I was not entirely a juice noob on my first juicer, it did have some major issues.";Chronicles of the thing

52;26.0;5.0;25.0;1631;I bought the Breville centrifugal juicer and the Omega masticating juicer to give them both a hands on try.  Both are well built, semi-easy to clean, and deliver great juice.

With the ten year warranty I feel confident that this will be on the counter in my kitchen for years to come.  The juice it makes is so good my 2 1/2 year old loves it!  We fib and tell her it's apple or pineapple juice when there's greens mixed in and she loves it.  I returned the Breville feeling somewhat guilty returning a product as fine as it is.  If you have the money go for the Omega, if you are on a budget and greens are not a priority then I would say the Breville is an excellent choice!\n\nUpdate** 9/28/2011\nAfter over two months of juicing this thing is keeping strong!  I will update in a few months time.\n\nUpdate*** 9/25/2012\nAfter a year of juicing with this beast it runs as nicely as the first time!

53;92.0;5.0;7.0;1656;I bought this juicer in September of 2009 and have been juicing pretty much everyday since.\nIt juices everything: wheat grass, kale, broccoli, carrots, apples, grapes, watermelon, citrus...\nWe even made pasta once with the attachments and it worked well at that, too.\nIt's easy to clean and assemble. It has a somewhat small opening, so one has to cut up the ingredients (no juicing an entire apple with this product). But it's possible to juice an average-size carrot, tip first, without cutting it. For leafy greens, I roll the leaves lengthwise and push down with the wand that comes with the unit.\nI researched juicers before buying and the masticating types, like this product, are said to best preserve nutrients and enzymes in vegetables and fruits. The juice tastes great, doesn't have a lot of foam and you can re-use the fiber in other recipes if you want (I give it to our dog, mixed in with her food).\nI haven't had a problem with the juicer in nearly two years of daily use.;great product
54;79.0;5.0;8.0;1678;"When my friend purchased this juicer about 7 months ago, I was immediately harsh and skeptical and thought she could've purchased a much better juicer. My main reasoning is that I used to sell juicers about 6 years ago, and at that time, single-auger juicers were truly horrible. Clunky, inefficient, and left a lot of juice in the pulp.\n\nBut then we started using this Omega 8005, and I immediately realized that the technology had improved greatly. No more clunky. No more leaving juice behind. They've completely redesigned the auger on this one, and the benefits are immediate:\n\n- no more clunky juicing.\n- no more leaving juice behind in the pulp\n- does leafy greens and wheatgrass VERY well\n- handles any vegetable at all\n- quiet. Like an old-time hand mixer. No jumping around the kitchen table either\n- allows for mix of vegetables and fruit, without changing screens\n- NO EXTRA PARTS (this alone is worth five stars). Meaning you don't have to choose which parts are needed depending on what you're juicing... you JUST JUICE.\n\nBut where their  brilliance really lies is in the screens. They decided to do something really interesting: the first screen has large holes, which is normally a no-no because too much pulp goes through. But then that juice lands in a very easy-to-use screen tray that lays across the juice holder, and that captures the larger pulp. But it gets better, because one of the chores of heavy duty juicing is that you have to occasionally stop, remove the screens, clean them, reassemble, and then continue juicing. NO MORE. With this simple screen tray, if the pulp builds up too much, you simply take the plunger tool and rub it across the screen; this allows any buildup of juice to pass through the screen. No stopping the machine, no taking it apart. You just keep juicing. All the while, that first large-hole screen NEVER clogs, so you don't have to take it apart. It's so brilliant in its simplistic design, it's amazing that no one thought of it before. Instead of going high tech, they used low tech. Stunningly ingenious if you've used juicers for a few decades.\n\nThe question always gets asked so here it is: yes, this juicer juices leafy greens, parsley, wheatgrass (entire trays! Again, no need to stop and clean). It also does apples, pears, and other fruits quite easily, all because of the screen system described above. So you can be juicing carrots, beets (use the yellow, not the red, because it tastes a lot better), cabbage, and then switch to an apple or two, then some wheatgrass, then some kale, then back to carrots. It handles everything.\n\nSome other reviewers talked about needing to cut carrots first. The opening is actually quite large, so most things fit in. The main point is that the motor never chokes on what you put in there. If I try to shove too much parsley (which is really tough and stringy), I'll hear the motor RPMs drop, but even with that, it just keeps chewing away.\n\nIt's been over a half year, and we've put some heavy use on it (daily about a quart of juice). With a 10-year warranty, I don't believe we'll have any problems.\n\nOne last note: Omega has a 8005 and 8006 model. From my understanding, the only difference is in what the auger is made from. The other mode (the 8006) has a new GE Ultem material which is supposed to be even tougher than the material that this 8005 is made from. They also add 5 years to the 8006 warranty, to make it 15 years. I think the price on the 8006 is about $50 more. Personally, I think either juicer will last you a lifetime. Both are otherwise built identically.\n\nFive stars to this 8005, and kudos to the brilliant engineers at Omega for coming up with this revolutionary design.";Very surprised. Great engineering. Changes the game in juicing
55;42.0;5.0;15.0;1701;I don't think you can really compare the Omega masticating (auger) juicer with the Breville centrifugal juicer. They are 2 different kinds of juicers.\n\nI've been a juicer for years. I have both juicers. It's the Omega that stays on my counter and get used almost daily. I use the Breville when I want to do a lot of one thing - like all apples, or all carrots.\nBut mostly I use the Omega because it is slower, less oxidation and it cleans up faster than the Breville. AND you can make nut butters - soak some raw cashews and push through - amazing and smooth - or make my own tahini, or grind up soaked dates and nuts and some raw cacao and make my own healthy raw candy. (The new vertical Omega masticating juicer doesn't make nut butters it says.)\n\nI prefer no pulp and with either juicer I always strain my juice through a nut milk bag (a fine mesh cloth)\n(many strain their juice during a healing juice fast for lightening the load on digestion)\n\nSome people complained of the small opening and that you have to cut things up smaller to go through - yes, but when I make a quart of juice, its a meal and you have to spend a little time making your meal! I suppose I'm used to it after using it all the time. I put all my veggies in a bowl (my favorite green juice: kale, ginger, apple, celery, cucumber) wash them. Cut the ones that need it, juice it, then use the same bowl to put the mesh bag in to pour the juice in. Squeeze and pour into a glass and yum.\n\nOmega, slower and quieter and easy to clean easy to assemble and makes nut/seed butters and wheatgrass juice.\nBreville, faster and louder, takes a little longer to clean and put back together.\nBoth make great juice.\nBut I love my Omega more.\n\nWhat ever juicer you use, you get a gold star for juicing!;Omega My Favorite Juicer

Hard to describe without just saying ""Awesome"".  This juicer handled everything I could put in it with no issues at all, and it runs surprisingly quiet for such a powerful juicer.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to clean up afterwards.  I couldn't be happier.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is really into getting everything you can out of juicing.  Best appliance I've bought in a very long time.";Best juicer I've ever had!!!
59;14.0;1.0;61.0;1825;Okay, I understand how this juicer is supposed to work, but only after I bought it from my local health food store, got it home, read the instructions and tried it.  It works great for things like carrots, celery, spinach, cucumbers and the like.  However, if you want just a plain ol' glass of fresh apple juice, forget it with this juicer.  It comes out more like apple sauce rather than apple juice.  I have little kids who love apple juice - alone - not mixed with anything else.  But in order to get the juice that I needed, I had to juice some carrots along with the apples.  I had to beg and plead for my little ones to give it a try.  In the end, they liked it, but it would have been easier just to hand them a glass of plain ol' apple juice without the fight.  I even made sure that the apples were refrigerated (very cold) as suggested in the instruction manual to get better juice from them.  But no, it didn't work.  And nowhere on the box does it say anything about this problem with juicing just apples alone (or other soft fruit for that matter - I've also tried pears with the same sad results).  I love freshly made green drinks, and if this juicer were meant to be just for me, I would be fine with it.  But I also bought it to use for my whole family.  So if you're looking to make fresh apple juice (or pear juice, etc.) without anything else added, this is not the juicer for you.  But if you like to juice harder things like beets, carrots, celery, cucumbers ... and even leafy greens like spinach, beet greens, etc., then this juicer works great for that!;Makes great apple sauce!
60;108.0;4.0;6.0;1835;I have to give it up to the Omega series 8003-8006 models. To my understanding the differences are in color, Warranty, Auger hardness and price. the 8003(is white)and the 8005(is Chrome)both have a 10 year Warranty with the standard Auger. The 8004(is white)and the 8006(is chrome)both have a 15 year Warranty and the 8x Harder Auger. the chrome is more expensive than the white by about $50 that's why I have the 8004(It's white less expensive.) it has the harder auger (not really sure why that's important)and the 15 year warranty (5 years more than the 8003 or 8005). but anyway I like this juicer because it does leafy Greens really well. I had a Green Star 3000 and that thing was a peace of junk in my opinion. It sucked at juicing leafy greens. It gives out a lot of pulp and turns MOST of the juice into foam. but if you juiced other types of produce with your greens then it did a pretty good job. But the feed shut was always backing up wile juicing Whatever! You would have to let the machine run for a few seconds to let it clear itself or juice would overflow through the feed shut. to put the icing on the cake the damn thing was Super hard to clean. and all the hype about having a higher yield is exaggerated. if you juiced 20 carrots in the Green Star and 20 in the Omega the green star might get 2 TBLS more juice than the Omega would. now with that being said the omega 8004 doesn't have those problems. it juices leafy green with no problem. it juices almost anything with no trouble. stuff like really ripe tomatoes and kiwis (and things of that nature) might give you a little problem. But for the most part this juices is the s**t! I also had a Breville JE95XL and a Breville 800JEXL both centrifugal juicers. I thought they were the best on the market for 3 years. they were really fast and easy to clean. but when I start using my Green Star I did see and taste a real difference in the juice. centrifugal juicers put out a frothy weird tasting juice by comparison to cold press juicers. and in my experience the juice Oxidizes (turns brown) 3 to 10 times faster in the centrifugal juicer. centrifugal juicers produce juice a lot faster than any cold press juicers (even my favorite cold press the Omega Vert 330 or 350HD witch is a hell of a lot faster than any other cold press juicer. but the Vert doesn't do leafy greens as well as the 8003-8006 series. ) but cold press juicers do yield a more stable and flavorful juice. I have both the Omega Vert and 8004. I sold my Green Star and Breville juicers on eBay. If I could only have one juicer it would be the Omega Vert but one of the Omega 8000 series is a close second  so if you're like me and you want to juice straight leafy greens for the most part and whatever else on the side then the Omega 8004 is a must.;This juicer is Good To Go
61;54.0;5.0;13.0;1850;I have used centrifugal juicers for years...or not used them.  Cleaning the centrifugal juicers was a real pain and even though I loved juice I made juice less and less because of the cleaning process.\n\nI purchased this masticating juicer about a year ago and it works beautifully.  I actually use it all of the time because to clean I just pop off the juicing assembly, break it down to its components in the sink, rinse off and store on my drying rack until next use (usually the next day or two).  Sometimes I have to wipe down the chrome motor housing that the assembly attaches to.  It's really just that simple to clean.\n\n10 year warranty!\nJuices veggies wonderfully with lots of juice.\nJuices most fruits wonderfully too.\nCleans up really quickly and easily.\nRuns quietly and smoothly.\nLooks good on my counter.\n10 year warranty!\n\nNormally I don't make so much juice at once but I currently have sick people in my home so last night I juiced about 8 oranges and one whole pineapple.  Due to so much soft fruit I had to clean the screw twice during juicing due to stoppage.  I've not had this problem with just oranges, btw.  That was the most labor intensive juicing I have done in an entire year of use and I use it at the very least twice a week but sometimes 3 or 4 times a week.  99% of the time running the soft fruits or veggies first and following up with harder ones works like a charm and that is no exaggeration!\n\nI've made some of the healthiest and tastiest juices just by throwing together a bunch of veggies.  I also made a veggie juice last night using an apple, a lemon, a small cube of ginger, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes and celery.  No recipe just picked out some veggies I wanted. Delicious!  Throw in a squirt of tabasco and make it a bit spicier if you like.  I have never made a juice I didn't like though that is probably possible.\n\nPomegranate juice...Don't get me started on how good that is.  Hint:  Fill a large bowl with water, break apart under water.  Seeds sink.  Peel and pith float. Strain, juice, drink, happy dance!\n\nI've juiced beets, carrots, squash, spinach, cucumbers, celery, broccoli, tomatoes, turnips, apples, grapes, pomegranates, pineapple, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, pears, and some I forgot.\n\nThis is an easy, fast solution to achieving better health for yourself and your family.  Easy to use, cleans up quickly, cheaper than most of this type and a 10 year warranty.  If you're strictly a fruit juicer then you may (and I stress 'may') want to go centrifugal but veggies and fruits or just veggies you can't go wrong with this.  I would even use this for just fruits because the juice quality will be better and if you have to stop and clean the screw it won't take any longer to use this juicer than it would to use and clean up the centrifugal one when you're finished with it.\n\nDon't forget to put all of that pulp in your mulch pit!  You will have fat and happy earthworms who will make the best soil for your garden which recycles that unused pulp and puts it back into something you can eat or juice.;Great Juicer. Great Warranty.
62;123.0;5.0;5.0;1873;I LOVE my Omega! I am on an intense juicing diet and make no less than 6-8 juices a day and have owned this juicer for 2 and half months. This baby is a work horse! I have owned a Champion and the cetrifuge type and love this one the  BEST! Easy to clean and runs like a kitten.;Love The Omega!
63;85.0;1.0;8.0;1959;Yeah it arrived on time but I would rather it be late in good condition and WORK! It had 0 power and I tried it in different outlets. No success. Complete waste of time and drama with Amazon. Yes I got my refund back promptly. I got the Breville instead and i'm very happy with it!!;No Power!!! Did Not Work!!!!
64;116.0;4.0;6.0;2088;Let me start off by stating that this is my first juicer that I've ever purchased so I have nothing to compare it to and have very little juicing experience. Let me also add that I've owned this product for about 2 days now and its off to a good start.\n\nAfter months of deliberation and research I chose the Omega J8005. It's extremely quite and has about the same noise level as a vibrating cell phone. It produces very little to no foam. It does not heat up the juice despite what other reviewers have posted (it's a flat out lie). It's very easy to clean and took me less than 5 minutes washing everything. There are exactly 4 parts to wash and a simple rinse cleans half the mess. This morning I juiced about 10oz of juice in about 10 minutes and that's including the chopping. It also took me 10 minutes to learn how to use the juicer and put it together out of the box. It has a very simple design and is very user-friendly. I even taught my roommate how to use it in 2 minutes. And simply the best thing about this product is the 10 year warranty. If Omega is going to put a 10 year warranty behind a product that gets used everyday then they must have done something right.\n\nThe down side to this product is that you do have to chop everything, even large strawberries. Personally I don't mind the chopping only because It equates to longevity in the product. The other down side is that a lot of pulp comes out into the juice and although I don't mind drinking it I hate the idea of so much of it going to waste if I ever decide not to drink it. I have to put the pulp back through the juicer for round 2 to extract more juice but it shouldn't be this way. It seems to be about 50/50 at this point 50% Juice and 50% Pulp that gets extracted in the first time around.\n\nWith some minor flaws and a little invested time this product is still amazing overall. I would rather spend 10 minutes extracting juice with a product that lasts 10 years than to spend 10 seconds extracting juice with a product that last 1 year.;Off to a good start
65;125.0;5.0;5.0;2128;works great, I have made fresh veggie juice from carrots and celery, baby food, and used it to grind my flax seed. It is also easy to clean.;works great
66;62.0;5.0;12.0;2152;I bought a Breville centrifugal juicer couple of months ago, At first I was excited...my first juicer, made decent amount of juice...but then I started to realize it wasted product so much...pulp was not very dry, greens don't juice at all, 60% of the time you would see vegetables or fruit slices in the pulp....\n\nI ignored it first but then I became a serious juicer and not being able to juice greens bothered me, so I sold it off for half the price(I used it for 2 months...)and got my Omega 8005...I love it....pulp is very dry.\n\nMy only complaint is I dint have to cut nothing in Breville, for Omega you have to cut veggies and fruits up, Guess I will get used to that.....Another cosmetic issue I have is I donot like the plastic bins that come with it.....for a 260$ juicer they could have done a better job......\n\nIf you are serious about juicing..this is it.....LOVE IT\n\nTips...\n1)Add honey and lemon if you want to sweeten vegetable juice...it tastes great...\n2)Add an apple or some grapes to vegetable juices to make them more palatable...;Awesome Juicer
67;118.0;4.0;6.0;2164;I do like this juicer very much. Compared to my last one it takes fewer veggies to produce a larger drink and the pulp is drier, the motor much quieter.\n\nBe aware, though, there is one part - the straining device - where the metal chips off. Whether this gets into the juice I do not know but apparently they are working on a replacement part.\n\nAlso, I wasn't happy buying from Omega. They charge shipping where some other companies do not and they are not that great to deal with.\n\nBut as juicers go, I think this one does the job very well.;Good juicer ... but
68;93.0;5.0;8.0;2171;"I advise every household to get one of these juicers.  The health benefits are truly incredible!  This is the first juicer that I have bought and hopefully the last one.  It is extremly easy to use.  The disassembly, cleaning and re-assembly is very easy and takes minimal time.  The pulp is dry and one obtains a good quantity of juice for the vegetables used.  I have been using the juicer daily for a few days and just cannot say enough good things about it.  I have juiced carrots, oranges, celery, apples, beets, parsley, ginger, and each time the juice has tasted heavenly!  If you have the money and are in the market for a juicer, I advise you to buy this one without any hesitation.\n\nFor the reviewer who wrote that the vegetables had stained his extruder drum, I have had no such problems. I wash it right after using it. Also preparing and cutting the vegetables for the juicer hardly takes a few minutes.  It is a task to be enjoyed!\n\nIn addition to this juicer, please buy a Vita-mix machine.  Between these two appliacnes one will have all the necessary equipment to stay out of the health care system!  Between juicing vegetables and fruits, and blending them with sprouts, nuts, fresh greens and such, you will be supplying your body with all the nutrients it needs.  This is an essential requirement for good health as the body ages.\n\nI would like to give my advise to those who arrive at this review looking for good health.  Good health cannot be bought through health insurance or visits to doctors.  It must be earned through a combination of three things\n\n1) Good nutrition\n2) Internal cleansing\n3) Proper exercise\n\n1) Good nutrition: I want to emphasize that good nutrition is NOT at all what the food pyramid defines it to be.  They have no clue about good nutrition.  The food pyramid is biased due to the lobby money of big agribusiness, big pharmaceuticals, the American Medical Association (AMA) etc to sell more dairy, meat and other big agricultural products.  About 75% of the subsidies given out by congress every yr goes towards meat and dairy industries and less than 1% goes towards vegetables and fruits!  Have you ever wondered why a burger at the fast food outlet costs less than $1 while a pint of berries costs over $2+, when the burger is FAR more resource intensive to produce?  Its the subsidies.  Without the subsidy the burger would cost $12 (2009)!  After eating for decades according to the guidelines of the USDA's food pyramid, most of us are bound to end up at the doctor's office.  This is because the guidelines were laid down by the same people who wanted to push more of their products for money.  The top executives in the USDA are all former executives of big agribusiness -- Monsanto, Du Pont, ConAgra, Smithfield, Archer Daniel Midland etc  Please watch these DVDs and become aware of what is going on with our foods:\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-Cancer/dp/B0016K3EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing Cancer</a>\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Future-of-Food/dp/B000V5IOWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Future of Food</a>\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eating-3rd-Edition/dp/B001CRQ8K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eating - 3rd Edition</a>\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Food-Inc/dp/B0027BOL4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Food, Inc.</a>\n\n2)  Internal cleansing: This topic is virtually unknown to the modern medical establishment.  However, it is the ABSOLUTE KEY for good health.  Without complete elimination of internal toxins, good health is impossible!  The key procedure for internal cleansing is enemas, and colon irrigations, and juicing.  Even if one is a vegetarian and eats right, one must still resort to enemas and colon irrigations to remove all crud, mucoid plaque, parasites, and such from the bowels.  This step cannot be emphasized enough.  Additionally one should supplement internal cleansing with colon implants using wheatgrass juice.\n\n3)  Proper exercise: While working out at the gym or doing aerobic exercises, as in running and swimming, are good, they are definitely not sufficient.  Moreover, overdoing these activities will result in muscular imbalance, tightness in joints, overuse injuries etc  Further, they do not stimulate the endocrine and nervous system adequately.  Additionally, it may be difficult to pursue these activities as the body grows older.  I strongly reommend yoga, since it can be done until the day one dies.  It exercises all the muscles, joints, nervous system and endocrine system.  One can start from whatever state one may be in, however ill and run down.  I have been practicing yoga for 7 yrs now and can safely say that I am still alive because of its practice.\n\nTo illumine yourself more about true health, disease and healing, food and juicing etc. I strongly recommend these DVDs.  They can be bought at Amazon.com, or rented from a video outlet, or checked out from Netflix (which is where I obtained them):\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beautiful-Truth/dp/B001J66JQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beautiful Truth</a>:  This is an excellent DVD, the bonus feature is the ABSOLUTE best and demonstrates the healing power of nutrition and internal cleansing.\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dying-to-Have-Known/dp/B001J66JQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dying to Have Known</a>:  Again, excellent DVD which demonstrates the healing capacity of food and internal cleansing.\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gerson-Miracle/dp/B001J66JQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gerson Miracle</a>: Excellend DVD.\n\n<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoxsey-How-Healing-Becomes-A-Crime/dp/B0006H3194/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoxsey: How Healing Becomes A Crime</a>:  Excellent DVD.\n\nIf you follow the guidelines I have given above, I can assure you that you will enjoy a long, healthy and disease free life.  The above guidelines are what have restored my health.  I used to be walking corpse, but now I am 51 yrs old and better than what I was in my teen years!  Last week when it snowed here in PA, I helped three people dig out their vehicles from deep snow!  Such is the endurance I now have.  I attribute it all to the above methods.  Juicing is the absolute key!";Excellent product!  This is true health insurance!
69;27.0;4.0;26.0;2195;Most has already been said, this is a fine performing juicer. I use it with leafy greens, carrots, apples, parsley, ginger, garlic, beets, celery and pineapple mostly. Omega's warranty is solid. In the five years I've had mine, I've had to have the Auger replaced twice, the end cap broke once and the original juicer screen was defective . All replaced at no charge. I have ended up buying a second set of replacement parts for it though, as I don't want the down time of no juicing.\n\n For those that are fretting over the new 8006 juicer, the only difference is the power switch placement, a larger hopper, and the auger itself is much improved. When my last white auger was cracking, I asked Omega if I could replace it  with the new GE Ultem one and pay the $20 retail difference. No problem they said..... and I'm so glad I did. The GE Ultem Auger is much harder and does not get the mineral build up sticking to it like the white one made of melamine. I really can't see how Omega can continue selling the 8005 juicers with white augers as the new GE augers are better in every way and only cost $20 more.\n\nI would no longer recommend anyone buy this juicer because the inferior auger though..... unless you buy an 8005, and upon receiving it,  send the auger to Omega and pay the extra $20 for the GE Ultem auger.  It's that much better. .  .  . this from personal experience.;Fine Juicer, But Get The GE Ultem Auger
70;15.0;5.0;51.0;2219;"First of all it is important to understand there are a couple of different types of juicers available to consumers and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.  However if you want to be able to juice ALL fruits and vegetables and do so efficiently and economically then you will need more than one type of juicer.  There are the centrifugal type juicers that work by forcing the juicing item onto a set of spinning blades centrally located which instantly grates the item and is then thrown out by centrifugal force onto a large spinning screen where the juice is separated by passing through the screen and the pulp slides up the screen and into a bin.  Then there are the masticating type juicers (this Omega 8005 for example) in which the juicing item is forced into a barrel with a rotating screw which essentially conveys it forward and subsequently crushes (chews it up or ""masticates"" the item) and then forces it against a screen where the juice passes through it and out the bottom while the pulp continues to be pushed forward and out the front.  There's the hydraulic press where the items are placed in a strong fine mesh bag and is then literally crushed in a hydraulic press forcing the juice to flow through the mesh bag while the pulp remains inside.  There's also the citrus reamers and finally the common kitchen blender.\n\nThe kitchen blender does a nice job with soft pulpy fruits that do not release juice, such as bananas and blueberries... you take the blended mush and just add it to other extracted juices.  However for most other types of fruits and vegetables there's just too much pulp, seeds and skins to make blender juicing drinkable.\n\nThe citrus juicer is really the best way to juice any citrus fruit as the other methods involve peeling the citrus first and end up being too time consuming to properly prepare the fruit for juicing everytime.\n\nThe centrifugal juicers are fast and can juice a very wide range of firm and soft fruits and vegetables, however small and pulpy items don't juice efficiently and these juicers can't really juice the leafy greens.  Also they can produce quite a bit of foam.\n\nThe hydraulic press might be a good process for juice extraction... in fact, it darn well better be because those things cost upward of $2500!!!  Also they appear to be very messy and complex in operation... however I don't know for sure as I would never spend that much money on any juicer and so have never tried on personally but I have watched all those videos.\n\nFinally, this brings us to the masticating juicer... these are virtually the only juicer type that can realistically juice the leafy greens properly. And these juicers will also do quite well with most firm fruits and vegetables but can quickly become an effort in frustration when trying to juice the softer fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, melons and berries because the small screen gets plugged up to easily.  In fact any of the fruits with a high soluble fiber content will very quickly plug up a masticating juicer.\n\nWe actually own all the juicer types described above (with the obvious exception of the hydraulic pre$$ type juicer), with the Omega 8005 as our masticating juicer.  It is indispensable for juicing leafy greens and consuming those 'greens' is really key to many of the major health benefits derived from juicing.  These greens included all types of lettuce, kale, swiss chard, parsley, dandelions, beet greens, kohlrabi greens, turnip greens, collards, spinach, various mild cabbages... however with some cabbages, mustard greens, endive, and other strong flavored greens a little bit goes a long way and too much can make the juice undrinkable.  Other items we commonly juice with the Omega are asparagus, carrots, cucumber, squash, celery, beets, kohlrabi, turnips, radishes, mushrooms, sprouts, broccoli/cauliflower, (careful with these last five items as they too can contribute very strong or musty/earthy flavors).  We have also run through apples, pears, tomatoes and such but they have a tendency to clog-up the screen too easily and since we also have a centrifugal juicer, that is where we more typically juice those pulpier items.\n\nThe Omega specifically has been an extremely durable juicer for us.  Since the extraction process is rather slow going, I typically will run it straight for a half hour or more while extracting a gallon or more of 'green' juice.  It has no problem crushing the hard stuff (beets, kohlrabi, carrots) steadily for 10 or 15 minutes straight and as long as I alternate the firmer items with the softer items the screen doesn't plug up during a session.  This thing has a 10-year warranty and I believe it as the motor is very powerful and everything appears to be built to withstand hard use for years.  After almost 7 months of heavy usage (3X a week @ 30min-1hr each) this Omega has performed flawless and effortlessly the whole time, the chrome plated (over plastic) finish doesn't stain and still looks like new. The plastic barrel and components are very quick and easy to assemble/disassemble and are of high quality... however they do stain, though its to be expected its not really noticeable since the barrel is tinted a 'smoky' see-thru.  The design is intelligent and functional.  Cleaning is a breeze with just a fast rinse for most parts and a simple, quick brush (included) of the screen.  By the way, slicing up the juicing items is no big deal if you have a sharp knife and a cutting board, just a quick length-wise slicing of the larger items is all that's necessary.  Tip: don't be afraid to ram that plunger down into the chute when leafy items jam, as that will happen... I actually pound the palm of my hand on it on occasion to get stuff through, the Omega can take it, it is built tank-tough... be aware as this is no light-weight.\n\nSo far we haven't attempted to use any of the other features as we bought this thing just for juicing.  The bottomline here is, you need the 'greens' to get most of the major benefits of juicing and only a masticating juicer will do the leafy greens.  When it comes to masticating juicers this Omega is probably as good as it gets... its powerful, well-built, high-quality, easy to operate and clean and though it is expensive, if you stop to amortize it over the 10-years life span you can expect out of it, I think it well worth it.\n\nFind more at juices4life.com";If its a masticating juicer you want, this is the best!
71;127.0;5.0;5.0;2238;I love this juicer! It does not waste fruits and vegetables. I was surprised to see so much juice come out of one little piece of fruit! Im very impressed. This juicer exceeded my expectations!;In love with it!
72;126.0;5.0;5.0;2238;Juicer chews up carrots like no tomorrow. Great with pomegranates as well.  It takes me less than one minute to clean the few parts. This type of juicer ensures that you do not heat up the juice thereby preserving all the healthy components.;Happy Customer
73;52.0;5.0;15.0;2244;"I LOVE this juicer!\n\nThe Omega 8005 is incredibly efficient.  It juices quickly, and leaves dry, pale pulp (meaning that pretty much all the juice that could possibly be extracted from the fruit/veggies has been).  I've even run the pulp back through the juicer to see how much more juice would be extracted, and it wasn't more than a few tiny drops.  It is VERY efficient with leafy green vegetables, which is something that other (cheaper) juicers often struggle with.\n\nThis juicer is VERY easy to use.  I had no problem putting it together right out of the box (hardly even had to glance at the instructions), and it takes me less than 10 seconds to put back together after cleaning.  I really believe that ease of use (assembly & clean-up) is the difference between having a juicer that you use once every few months & one that you use everyday!\n\nThe juicer is beautiful & looks very nice sitting on the countertop.  My understanding is that the the Omega 8003 is the same as this 8005 - only the 8005 is silver where the 8003 is white.  The 8003 looks okay, but the 8005 is actually gorgeous.  It's also fairly compact & take up less room than I expected.\n\nOne thing about this juicer vs. ones like the Breville is that you can't just toss whole fruits or vegetables into the Omega.  The Omega 8005's chute is somewhat small.  Admittedly, I was a little nervous about this, as I didn't want to spend 30 minutes chopping my produce into tiny pieces prior to juicing.  However, this is not a big downside - and it's a ""downside"" that I feel is worth it.  I've found that it takes me less than 3 minutes to wash & chop my vegetables to prepare them for juicing, and from what I've read, the Omega produces more juice than a lot of the other juicers on the market.  Taking an extra 3 minutes out of my morning to chop veggies when it's going to yield more (and better-tasting) juice is a small price to pay, in my opinion.  (And the produce doesn't need to be bite-sized or anything; just thin enough to put into the chute, which is about 1.5"" across.)\n\nOverall, I am only sorry that I didn't buy this juicer sooner.  I hemmed & hawed over spending $250 on an appliance when I wasn't sure how much I would use it...  Well, I have never had a juicer before this Omega so I can't compare it to other juicers out there, but I LOVE this thing.  I look forward to juicing every morning, and just one month after buying it, I can no longer imagine my mornings without my green juice.\n\nDon't hesitate on buying this juicer!  I am confident that you won't be sorry.  I can't imagine having a juicer that is easier to use or produces better juice!";Fantastic juicer!
74;44.0;5.0;17.0;2253;We are heavy juicers.  And, we are veterans of several brands including the Champion.  We juice just about everything from pineapple to oranges to wheatgrass.  And, I must say, this is the best juicer that we have ever owned.  I say this both because of its versatility and ease to clean. The Champion beat things to a froth and heated up the juice to a point where good nutrients were lost.  It was tedious to clean and juiced oranges (a family favorite) very poorly.  (We needed a separate juicer for the wheatgrass. A real pain, particularly when you wanted a combined drink.) This machine is a little slower, a lot quieter, and produces better quality from just about everything - carrots, apples, beets, spinach, etc.  We didn't need to make any changes in the way we prepared our fruits and veggies. We purchased it from Amazon because we have had such good fortune with them in the past and because they had the best price.  We have now owned the Omega for nearly a year. It has put the fun of juicing back in our lives.  I believe that it will do the same for you.;Such a juicer exists?

When plugged in and switch turned on nothing happened. Upon closer inspection i found the opening that would normally hold a reset button on the underside of the appliance was just an empty hole. Since the package was apparently not tampered with it came directly from China this way. The quality control on many products ""made in China"" has been steadily going down over the last couple of years.\n It's now about a 50/50 chance that one of their products is working as intended.\nI am giving this product 3 stars because the principle designed is very good. It's just bad quality control and the choice of materials used is at least questionable.\nBTW. I got my money back quickly from amazon.com\nI am going to buy the 8006 model and hope for the best. The 8006 models main component composition is much better then the 8005. The compression screw  of the 8005 model is made of a polymer from melamine and formaldehyde. Two highly toxic materials. (As long  as they stay a polymer they are OK but !)\nWhen the screw is used under constant pressure coming in contact with other parts of the juicer over an extended period of time some of that polymer may come off and break up into its original harmful constituents and consequently be consumed with the ""healthy juice"".It's not going to kill you ,at least not right away,but who needs that?\nI know that the 8006 model uses a much harder polymer for the same part and is made from less toxic materials. So I am going to take a chance with that one.  Good luck folks  Holger";8005  Omega juicer not working at all
76;59.0;3.0;13.0;2401;Produce must be cut into fairly small pieces in order to fit them into the chute, taking extra time when juicing in the morning.  The juicer also works quite slowly.  Most produce creates foamy juice.  I guess that's why they include two strainers with this juicer.  I much prefer my old Jack La Lane juicer.  The pulp came out much drier, indicating more juice was being extracted.  Also, it took larger pieces of produce, and worked much faster.  It was a centrifical force juicer, which is not supposed to be as good.  However, as I mentioned, the pulp waste was much drier.  And it seemed to produce much more juice in much less time than this Omega juicer.;Not Entirely Happy
77;76.0;5.0;10.0;2403;I researched juicers for months before taking the plunge. I had the money saved up for a greenstar but the ease of cleaning ultimately drove me to the Omega. The cost savings was just a bonus.\n\nI read the review about plastic shavings getting into the juice but after seeing the machine, I realized that even if that was happening (which it doesn't), it would only take a couple revolutions and then the plastic would be shaved down to the point of not touching the metal and therefore, not getting in the juice any longer. My auger doesn't in any way touch the metal so this is certainly not a problem that is consistent with this juicer.\n\nYes, the only drawback is that you have to cut most produce an extra slice thinner, but you more than make up for that in your clean up time. It is a little slow compared to something like a breville, but juice comes out without much foam and nutrients intact. It takes about 10 seconds to clean the whole shebang and that in itself motivates me to juice more often.\n\nOur daily juice looks something like: 2 carrots, 1 apple, a head of romaine, 1 cucumber, a cutting of wheatgrass, 1 zucchini, and then we end with a few sticks of celery to pull it all through. We have all types of produce in our morning juice and it handles it all like a champ.;LOVE this juicer!
78;48.0;4.0;16.0;2425;"I bought the Omega 8005 (Chrome & Black) Juicer one year ago and waited until now to give it an honest review.  I've owned two Hamilton Beach Juicers which both sound like a jet engine when turned on.  The Omega 8005 is not cheap though compared to it's twin-auger cousins, not the most expensive and does everything advertised it says it can do.  If there is one draw back to the juicer is that the auger does wear down if used extensively and the part isn't cheap to replace.  Brand new, it's a 5 star juicer and worth every penny.  I use my juicer on average twice a day and like other posted reviewers who have posted recipes; I've tried them all.  Green juicing beware; it is an acquired taste and not for the skiddish.  I like to see the auger stand up better over time which is why I gave it 4 stars, though I won't argue with those who gave it 5 stars.";"Omega 8005 is as advertised; an excellent all-around juicer!"
79;106.0;5.0;7.0;2482;The Omega Juicer Model 8005 arrived on time and packed well. As in the other reviews, the instructions are pretty vague. However, between the internet and other reviews, I was able to figure out how to set the machine up. It's actually very easy. The machine works flawlessly. Everything from spinach to oranges- have yet to juice something that doesn't work! Pulp is completely dry and ready to use in other recipes, if you'd like. You do have to chop your veggies up, but in a way, it's a good thing or else I would have a tendency to squeeze a whole pumpkin in! The motor works great- have only had it for a month and never have heard it have a hard time. The best part (other than the flavor of the juice) is the clean up. Hands down, the easiest juicer I've ever had to clean. If you are deciding on a juicer, spend the extra bucks and get one like this.;Love this Machine
80;121.0;5.0;6.0;2499;I have had my Omega juicer for almost 6 months now. I juice everyday and have tried 2 other juicers before this one. I love it. It's easy to clean up and has a blank plate that we use for making 'ice cream' by running frozen fruit through it. Even the kids use it! Happy happy with it.;I love the Omega 8005
81;128.0;5.0;5.0;2506;I bought this juicer a few months ago.  It works well and has a very strong motor.  I juice just about every vegetable and fruit grown and the juicer doesn't have a problem with any of it.  I juice kale, spinach, pineapple, carrots, cabbage, broccoli, celery, cucumber, melon, strawberries and pealed citrus fruit.  It is not difficult to clean.  I would recommend this to anyone who want to juice leafy veggies.  If you are going to juice only fruit, a blender might be a better buy.;Great Juicer
82;63.0;5.0;13.0;2529;"This is my second juicer.  My first was the centrifical type.  The one is just soooo superior to the previous one.  The unit has a solid, but not TOO heavy weight, and it does not take up a tremendous amount of counter space either.  The parts are not that complicated after reading the manual and spending about 5 min. figuring it out.  The parts are heavy-duty plastic -- not flimsy at all. The clean up is very fast as well, I think, compared to my old juicer.\n\nYou do have to cut some of the fruits and vegetables into chunks or slices to fit into the feeder; however, they feed very well, it only takes a few extra moments to cut them up, and the consistency is quite good, the pulp is very dry, and I only had to strain the juice with the supplied hand strainer for my daughter as I liked it just the way it comes out, myself.  I made carrot bread one day with the pulp as well.\n\nI puried a soft tomato that I normally would have had to throw out for tomato sauce in a recipe' with the blank insert that also comes with instead of the juicer insert, and I made a frozen banana blueberry desert that was very good!  I found out that it will also chop up veggies for soups or salsa, and also has inserts that will extrude pasta.  I'm excited to try that soon as well!";A Great Little Juicer!
83;30.0;4.0;25.0;2531;Bought this as a replacement to my Juicman juicer (now ancient).\n\nI've been very happy with the Omega. It stays out on my counter as a permanent fixture in the kitchen now as a constant reminder to use it each day. Here are some things to keep in mind when considering this vs. other juicers:\n\n1) Masticating juicers are not meant for casual juicers. If you are going to juice only carrots on the weekend, this is not the juicer for you. You'll spend more and be satisfied with a <$100 centrifugal juicer.\n\n2) Cleanup is a breeze. It's actually easier than my old Juiceman.\n\n3) Be prepared to cut things down to size. The chute is small so even carrots sometimes need te be cut up.\n\nOverall, juicing takes about 5x longer with a masticating juicer. The benefits are: better juice, more juice, a quiet machine and the ability to juice greens.;A Great Juicer
84;86.0;4.0;9.0;2534;I have tried numerous juicers and for the money, this is the best. The pulp comes out extremely dry (unlike the Champion), so you can juice things like wheat grass, cilantro, and parsley, as well as carrots, beets, spinach, and nearly anything else. The pasta and nut butter add-ons are a nice touch.\n\nI actually would have gone for 4.5 stars if that option were available. The only two small issues I have are the feeder tube is a little small meaning you need to cut the veggies up first, and the unit is a little noisy. But as far as juice quality is concerned, this is the one.\n\nNote: Look through all the Amazon vendors and find one that offers free shipping since this unit can cost up to $60 to ship.;Best Juicer out there
85;98.0;5.0;8.0;2584;This is my second juicer after a Breville juice fountain.  I bought this mainly because the Breville didn't juicy leafy greens well, but the Omega does this excellently.  Spinach, tomatoes, citrus, carrots all come out well.  The pulp comes out very dry so you know not much of your expensive veg is being wasted.  It takes maybe 3 minutes to clean up and takes up less counter space than the Breville.  So far -- no complaints.;Great!
86;129.0;5.0;5.0;2602;I researched those juicers for a long time, was not sure if it was worth investing in one since I have a Breville, but I wanted to juice green leaves too, which the Breville doesn't do. It is slower than the centrifugal juicer, you need to cut your veggies in small pieces, but it gives a very nice juice, less froth than a centrifugal juicer. The item itself is very sturdy, I like the stainless steel look as it won't change color. It is easy to clean. I am happy I got it.;Very, very  nice
87;40.0;4.0;19.0;2614;"We have a very simple philosophy; if an appliance is a pain in the hindparts to clean, you'll dread using it the next time.  To that end, we upgraded many of our appliances in our kitchen with both speed, energy efficiency, and easy cleanup priority.  Specific to this review, The Omega 8005 Juicer is almost perfect. I paid [...] with a [...] email coupon via [...] November 4, 2008.\n\nOn top of our refrigerator is our Hamilton Beach ""Big Mouth"" Juicer which is a centrifugal juicer strapped to a jet engine and leads you to believe its the kitchen version of a work shop bench grinder as are many high rpm centrifugal juicers.  I give my Big Mouth the one point I cannot give the Omega 8005 - speed.\n\nThe Omega 8005 is a change of pace, and requires a considerable amount of time with preparation of your fruit and vegetables which must be cut into smaller pieces to accomodate the chute.  That said, with the exception of carrots which the Big Mouth does a better job, the pulp is considerably drier, but neither is it completely dry; but nevertheless I was impressed at just how dry it is.\n\nApples, Oranges, Cranberries, Pomergrante Arils, Ginger,Cucumbers, Ginger - Superior!  Carrots - Very good.  Pineapple - Good (Unripe to Fresh), Poor (Over-Ripe).\n\nI've yet to use the pasta and nut butter attachments but I have made sorbets and every frozen fruit I've ran through it from frozen strawberries to frozen bananas is superior!\n\nThe Omega 8005 has been exactly as many user reviews say it is, and to those who have negative reviews with the exception of patience with prepping the food I have none.\n\nCleanup is a dream; no other way to put it!  I use the juicer twice a day and there is no comparison between this juicer and my Big Mouth, not that the Big Mouth is a that bad if you clean the little devil up right away.\n\nQuality of Juice?  I was surprised that there is some foaming but the mesh screen does what its suppose to and does separate foam from the juice.  There was no distinction between my Big Mouth and the Omega when it came to carrots, but everything else the comparisons definitely favor the Omega 8005.\n\nI should note, I own the Black and Chrome juicer and am aware there is no difference between the 8003 and 8005 mechanically other than Aesthetics.  There's no secret that dark colored appliances are more forgiving to the eyes than white...we have kid who shortcut their kitchen chores!\n\nPrice of the juicer is as of November 4, 2008 is [...]  minimum at every website I searched.  I knew their were two websites that offered email rebates while doing my research.  A tip to those who use CraigsList, their were some very, very good deals around the country, but Shipping & Handling made the difference between my purchase and it, very little difference, but if you can find the juicer in your backyard, consider looking there.\n\nI can't give the Juicer a 5 rating - it's not a cheap juicer but neither is it the most expensive and prep isn't for those who are impatient.  I do give the juicer a 4.5 if I could, or a 9 on a scale of 10.\n\nThe 10 year warranty, ease of cleaning and the style juicer it is and the variety of things you can do with it were the points which gave it the nod.";"Omega 8005 Juicer - On a scale of 10; a 9!"
88;90.0;5.0;9.0;2673;I have had this unit only a short time, but I am very pleased with it. I seems to be of good quality, is easy to clean, and is an attractive design. I think that it is worth the $253.00 it cost.;Quality Product
89;74.0;4.0;11.0;2675;If you are a first time juicer go get the The Fountain Elite and you will be happy with it. But hey, if you have a little time to spend, and actually want to make the best juice, then this is the machine for you. You have to cut your veggies and fruits into pieces, perhaps you can't get more than 5 glasses of juice without going through a cleaning cycle, but if you are willing to take that time sacrifice get this unit. It's solid, it works well with all leafs and it spits out carrots that taste like cardboards.\nI have had this machine for 3 days, and I am enjoying it.\nI would have given it a five star if I didn't have to cut the veggies and fruits in to such small pieces.;Not for the first time Juicer
90;35.0;5.0;22.0;2686;"I'd read many places that compared to centrifugal juicers, masticating juicers like this are better at juicing less ""juicy"" stuff like leafy vegetables but worse at juicing fruit. Don't believe it! I've owned both the basic Omega centrifugal juicer and the pulp-ejecting centrifugal version, and this 8005 model (which is the only one I use now) I believe does as good a job on fruit as those other models. And the ease of cleaning on this model blows the others away.\n\nI juice oranges, grapefruit, and apples regularly. I think the yield is high and the ejected pulp is very dry. Not a scientific test I know, but I guess my point is just that if you are on the fence about this model because you've heard it isn't as good on fruit, I'd recommend you go ahead with it. You won't regret it.";Does a great job with fruit, despite what you might read elsewhere
91;130.0;5.0;5.0;2701;"I think the last reviewer might have gotten the juicer without all the parts- the juicer has a plastic plunger to push the vegetables down the tube.\n\nIt works by rotating something in the middle, that pushes and grinds the vegetables against the grating, to a point where the juice and pulp are separated. It's a good juicer, and if you're concerned about ""oxidation"" ect, I would recommend it. It is also supposed to do a wide range of other functions, but I haven't tried yet. Pasta, nut butters, mill your own flour, ect.\n\nThe motor never has problems, even with tons of carrots going through. I can juice everything- and the pulp is reasonably dry, better than my old cheap one. A little more work than a fast juicer, but just due to the fact that is a ""low oxidation"" juicer, so doesn't go too fast to avoid foaming up the juice.\n\nWorks on wheat grass, lettuce(bleh), carrots, beets, ginger, apples, ect. Soft watery stuff doesn't work as well as hard/low moisture things, but overall good all-purpose juicer.";Good powerful juicer

It is showing its long teeth and decided I would try one of the macerating juicers. Upon receiving the Omega 8500 juicer I was amazed at its heft and quality of craftsmanship. Comparing this juicer to the Juiceman Jr. is like comparing a Hyundai Excel to a Maserati Quattroporto. The quality of the Omega 8500 is hands down superior to that of the Jr.\n\nThe mechanical differences are stark, and so is the quality of the end product; the juice. With a centrifugal extractor the juice is markedly more pulpy. With a macerating (chewing) juicer such as the 8500, the juice is almost clear. It goes through several increasingly smaller screens before being put in the cup. I was amazed at how dry the discarded vegetable pieces were at the end.\n\nThe real bonus is that this kit came with a set of pasta extruders. A very nice bonus indeed. I made several vegetable based pastas and the result was fresh pasta that cannot compare to dry store-bought.\n\nOverall a great product and highly recommended!";Powerful and creates tasty juices! Bonus pasta extruders!
93;60.0;5.0;14.0;2789;"I got this juicer a few months ago after researching various different brands and models.  I knew it was going to be an investment, so I didn't want to get something cheaper that was easier to afford ""right now"" but have to replace later on.  I chose Omega because of the great customer service I've read about.  I actually have the 8003, which is the same model in white.\n\nWhen the juicer arrived, I'll admit that we didn't use it for the first month or so.  We'd never juiced before, so it was part intimidation, I guess, and part being afraid we'd break the machine or just not be able to get it.  Plus it seemed like it would be a huge chore to assemble it, cut the food up, and then take it apart to wash every nook and cranny each time.  I figured the lazy person in me would win out for sure.\n\nBut then I got a nice book on juicing, and took their challenge for a beginner's week- it covered fruits, vegetables, and leafy greens.  I haven't stopped since.  This juicer is set up so conveniently.  It's easy to put together, the two cups collect the juice and pulp (which is squeezed so dry that running it through a second time just to see provided no extra juice) well, so you don't have to empty it or stop in the middle.  If a piece of food is not getting ""eaten"" by the machine, the masher thing works great, and has a rubber stopper for splashback.\n\nIt does squeak a little when you put very wet foods like pineapple in it, but all in all it's really quiet, and almost relaxing  to hear.  You could easily juice without someone in the next room knowing you were doing it.  It takes oranges (which I've heard you just can't get everything out of unless you use a citrus press)and bleeds them dry.  Leafy greens are great too, and it really gets everything it can from everything we've put in it.\n\nThe first time we used carrots, it did sort of stain the auger (the white part inside that turns and squishes the food) but it's not stained now, and if it were, that wouldn't bother me really.  As long as it stays clean, you're fine.  And cleaning- is so easy.  What you can't get with a rag or sponge and soap, you can get with the attached toothbrush accessory.  It's really easy, there's no hard to reach spots, and then just let it all air-dry and you can put it back together to use again.\n\nI highly recommend this juicer, it's very full-functioning, very well made, and despite the lack of information in the book, really quite easy to put together.  In fact, mine came already assembled (not attached to the base, though) so just taking it apart showed me how to put it together.";Well worth the money.  Save up if you have to.
94;124.0;5.0;6.0;2790;I just bought this juicer a few days ago and have used it a few times already and absolutely love it!!! It looks very nice and modern and has a very sturdy frame and design.  I did alot of research before purchasing this one and decided to go with it since it also juices wheatgrass and leafy greens.  I'm so glad I chose this one! It is very easy to use, is very nice looking, very quiet, not too hard to clean, and the juice is absolutely delicious!!! I just came up with this recipe for 2-3 glasses and LOVE it:  1/3 cucumber, 1 kiwi, 2 apples, 3 celery stalks, 3 carrots, 1 orange and a squeeze of lime/lemon juice.  It is soooooo delicious and I feel refreshed and re-energized after.  [...] I recommend this to anyone and think it is a great investment in your health!

95;64.0;5.0;13.0;2803;"Since I never had a juicer before I was spending quite a lot of time on the internet to understand what I wanted vs what machine could offer. Because of my weight problems I decided to go for liquid diet so I knew I would not use much fruits for my diet (higher content of sugar) but rather vegetables. So it has come to decision between centrifugal juice extractor (Jack LaLanne juicer and Breville 800-JEXL) or masticating juicer extractor (Omega 8005 or Green Power). I wanted machine for the ""greens"" and masticating type supposed to do better job with all kinds vegies and grass (it doesn't produce heat like centrifugal action). In the case of Green Power juicer - I am not sure if it offers good ratio of price to juicing action so I have bought less expensive Omega 8005. The juicer arrived just in time (and as scheduled)and in perfect condition. I was already fasting for 7 days and I wanted to drop finally some nutrients in a big hole I have created there, so I did my first glass of juice (I've purchased books ""The juice fasting bible"" by Sandra Cabott, MD and ""Juice Bible"" by Pat Crocker). I couldn't believe my eyes, me a glutton, I couldn't finish this glass of delicious juice (called hot spiced carrots).  My stomach has shrunk! The next step was to disassemble machine and clean it. It was quite easy and I was expecting 30 min chore but it took me less than 5 min. The only thing which probably will take longer, it is preparation of the food for juicing action. You have to cut them in smaller pieces because the opening is intentionally made smaller to prevent jams from bigger chunks. Does it bother me? No, I like solutions which works and so far no jams. With the help of juicer, finally, I was able to settle down for my loosing weight diet. For 2 days of liquid diet, I drink daily 2 glasses of juices and maybe some water, tea and coffee. On the third day I eat smaller amount of solid food, mainly meat with the steam vegetables (plus liquids) because I lift weights and I bike. On the 4th day total fasting (only water) and the next day a new cycle starts over again. Now, in the 6 weeks of this diet I was able to go from 255 lbs to 221 lbs. I think, drinking a lot of juice now, helped me to stop cravings for sugar and other ""evil"" carbohydrates (cookies, pastas, bread, white rice etc.) I have no more cravings for this crap food which created overweight problem for me. So, Omega 8005 is at core of my healthy diet, now. It was excellent purchase for me and well spend money. The machine look simple and solid. I can't imagine which part of Omega 8005 can break down even after many years of using.";"Don't  ""Google"" around for more choices, this is your juicer"
96;55.0;4.0;16.0;2864;I bought this juicer mainly for juicing wheatgrass - and am happy with it - the only thing is that I find I have to run the wheatgrass pulp through about two more times before the juice is completely extracted - and for veggies you have to cut them up pretty small. I don't know if this is 'normal' for good juicers as I have nothing really to compare it to -other than an old (cheaper model)Juiceman from about 15 years ago..and the Omega is a lot better than that, of course.. It looks good and is pretty easy to clean.;I like it...
97;38.0;5.0;22.0;2868;I don't know why people complain about cutting up the fruit. It barely takes any time to do so, and the juice from this juicer is the best I've had - and I've tried a couple of other juicers before this, one of them being the Juiceman.\n\nFirst of all, although there are a few parts to clean, they rinse right off - no fuss. The screen is easy to brush, unlike most other juicers where you're stuck cleaning them for 5-10 minutes because they're so huge and the juicer didn't do its job right.\n\nI am now addicted and juice every day - something I never did with my last juicer. You might find some juicers where you can drop in a whole fruit but those ones tend to have higher RPMs and therefore run hotter - starting to kill enzymes and nutrients in the juice. And of course, they will also take longer to clean.\n\nIf you'd rather take a little more time to chop instead of cleaning and want the most out of your juice then this is the best choice hands down.;Best Juicer for the Money
98;9.0;5.0;113.0;2884;If I were to do it all again, I would only buy the Omega 8005 juicer. I recently purchased both the Omega 8005 and the Breville 800JEXL. Initially, I read raving reviews on the Breville 800JEXL, and thought it was best. I also did not feel I would want to make my own wheatgrass juice. I was buying it at Lassen's healthfood store or at Wholefoods. They'll make it for you right there. After making daily trips to one of the stores - well, it got old. I realized that it would be a lot easier to make my own wheatgrass at home. So, I bought the Omega 8005, as well, and buy a flat of wheatgrass, as needed, from the market. (by the way, I'm keeping the wheatgrass flat in the refrigerator. That's how they store it at the market to prevent it from molding.)\n\nAfter juicing with the Omega 8005 (carrots, celery, beets, parsley, cucumber), including wheatgrass juice, I realized that I should have bought this juicer from the start. I was more than pleased and prefer it over the Breville Juicer. The Breville juicer is faster, but you need to turn on/off the juicer each time you add more vegetables or it will spray up all over the place. It's also very loud. The sound is similiar to an airplane taking off. The quickness of the juicer is lost by having to turn on/off all the time. Plus, I feel the Omega juicer has a higher juice yield and leaves a little bit of texture/pulp in the juice, as you find at juices made fresh at Healthfood stores. (you can filter it, if you want, they provide a filter, but I like it) The juice from the Breville juicer is completely smooth. No texture/pulp. Perhaps, the Omega yields more juice by leaving just a wee-bit of pulp. It's leaving just a little behind. Whereas, the Breville leaves absolutely no pulp. The Omega juicer produces little to no foam. The Breville juicer has a little more, even on its lowest speed, and a lot more foam on the highest speed. The Omega juicer has 10 year warranty and was $40 less (if not more, depending on whether you purchase Omega 8003 or 8005. They're both the same. The 8005 model is Chrome. The 8003 model is white.) The Breville warranty is somewhere around 1 year. -- you got the picture... The Omega juicer is extremely quiet. It wouldn't wake anyone sleeping, even in the same room. For me, I prefer having a quieter juicer that yields more juice, is super easy to clean up, makes wheatgrass juice, and takes up less counter space. We'll hold onto the Breville for a little while, just to be sure, but otherwise will sell. The Breville does have easy clean-up, but you need to be extra careful when washing the Mesh Filter/Teeth Plate as you could easily snag your finger on one of the blades. The Omega 8005 has no sharp parts for me to worry about and is even easier to clean. The Omega juicer is so much quieter and easier to use. And, sooo much more juice, too! Hands down - I prefer the Omega 8005 juicer.;Great all-around juicer.  Its all  you'll need.

The discarded pulp from apples and carrots (hard to juice) is very dry. Those fruits didn't produce much juice, but my 8005 sqeezed 'em out for sure. I wish it was a bit easier (faster) to clean. But good things come to those who wait, i guess. I'm happy with this model and would buy it again if I wear it out in 10 years.;A Good Buy**
101;10.0;5.0;94.0;2917;I wanted to buy this juicer but after reading some of the negative reviews, I almost changed my mind and bought something different which would have cost me way more money.  I am sooooo glad that I didn't because I LOVE THIS JUICER!\n\nMy father bought a less expensive juicer a few years back.  After only using the thing a few times when he first bought it, he stopped using it because the clean up was so time consuming.  The juicer ended up just taking up space on his shelf. Later, I started getting interested in healthy foods and so he gave the thing to me.  I was so excited to start but found that cleaning the thing took sooo long that it wasn't worth it.  It was depressing from day one and so I sold it at a garage sale.\n\nA few years later, I thought I would give it another try so I bought a different model juicer.  I guess I forgot how long cleaning took so the same thing happened.  I found myself always standing over the kitchen sink with a little scrubber trying to get all of those tiny little fibers from food out of the straining screen which was very tiring.  Also, shortly after purchasing that juicer, I learned about the value of juicing green leafy vegetables.  I tried juicing them but they just sat on the bottom of the screen and clogged up the juicer.\n\nNow again, a few years later I thought I would give it one more shot.  They say that the 3rd time is a charm and they are right!  This time I thought I would do it right and spend a little more money.  You get what you pay for right?  When I read on Mercola.com that Dr. Mercola recommended this juicer I knew I had found what I was looking for.  Still, I thought I would read the reviews on Amazon.com to see what other people thought of the juicer.\n\nI was a little hesitant and wondered if I should buy it because of some of the negative reviews about the small feeding tube and it being time consuming.  My mom had already bought one and loved it so I took a chance and bought it anyway.\n\nI can't say enough about this juicer!  It is amazing!  Yes, it has a smaller feeding tube but you can put celery and regular sized carrots in easily.  Things bigger such as apples need to be cut into smaller pieces but big deal!\n\nMy 7 and 9 year old kids love helping make their green lemonade because it is fun to watch.  They didn't like the juice from the other juicers because it was too pulpy for them but THEY LOVE DRINKING THIS JUICE!  This comes out with VERY LITTLE PULP just like the juice bar at the health food stores.  You can juice green leafy veggies such as cilantro, spinach, kale which are all sooo very good for you!\n\nThe clean up is simple and easy!!!  From my experience if it isn't easy to clean you won't be doing much juicing.  The straining screen is itty bitty.

102;45.0;5.0;19.0;2980;"I have had the Omega 8003 (white) for several years, and have given two away as gifts. The 8005 is the same model in chrome with black. They do the same things, including juicing leafy vegetables (such as kale, wheatgrass), and being easy to clean. Ease of cleaning was key factor for me, as without it I will not use items. This one I leave on the counter, and use daily. Great juices, relatively fast (but not as fast as noisy high speed, heat generating other brands you may find), and fairly quietly. [Prior to this I had a Waring...terribly noisy,difficult to clean, and required running the fruits/vegetables through 2-3 times to get maximal juice extraction; the pulp was very wet. I could not even successfully give it away, and wound up getting a refund.] This has been money well-spent (and it was $300 when I bought it), versus the high cost and lower freshness of juices on sale at the grocery, or even made at a trendy juice bar; I continue to use and enjoy it, appreciating its ease and speed of cleaning, utilizing the top rack of the dishwasher.  (I used to just soak the pieces in a large metal cooking bowl with hot water and soap, and easily rinse and dry, but now use dishwasher.) I found it extremely handy that it came with two containers and a mesh strainer, to conveniently place under the spout and pulp extruder. After just spending too much at the store for almond butter, I am going to try and make some cashew and almond butters, using the nozzle provided. This is just an added bonus, as I merely desired a juice extractor. I have never tried to make pasta with it. I highly recommend this appliance (with a 10-year warranty), which I use daily to increase my family's nutrition.

103;41.0;5.0;20.0;2981;"I am the very proud owner of the Omega 8005 - my very first juicer. After much research online, I chose this model, my factors were the 10 year warranty, the look and feel, the quietness, the criteria of being best at juicing vegetables first and fruits second, and the taste factor. I could not be happier about my decision. Earth Turns made the faster delivery (free shipping no less) to my house in 48 hours. The instructions manual from Omega leaves a lot to be desired. My battery chargers came with a thicker multi-lingual manual than this - this flimsy 3-page no-pictures lousy instructions manual. I admit I did not contact Omega to request more. I did not think I should have to do that after purchasing an expensive product. My genius hubby and I put it together just fine, but you do have to get the hang of how the main piece fits in. Sometimes it can be slightly out of adjustment, before it fits into place firmly. I have had my machine for about 3 weeks now and have used it about 10 times. I have easily juiced, alone or in various combinations, oranges, apples, celery, carrots, leeks, cilantro, lettuce, lime, and carrot tops. I have had absolutely no problems. The machine is very quiet. My Black & Decker blender is like a train wreck compared to this quiet system. The pulp is very dry. I tried to run it through a second time and it did not have any more juice to be extracted. Cutting vegetables into small enough pieces to run thru the chute does not bother me one bit. Using the plastic spoon thingie, you just push them down. I have had to push really hard at times when it seemed to be stuck but nothing out of ordinary or cause of concern. Washing up after the fact is really not bad - I am fast and efficient in the kitchen, I do it immediately, and I lay out a towel and wash every piece with warm water and soap, and let it dry. I do not intend to run the pieces through the dishwasher; I am not sure if you could or not (don't look for answers in that manual)! I cannot even begin to describe the taste - granted I am new to juicer, yet I have good palates and appreciation for freshness. I buy about 70% organic or more whenever I can. I have enjoyed every drop of juice my Omega has produced thus far and intend to use it for years to come. I did send the warranty paper in too, just so it is officially covered. I highly recommend this. It is a must for the healthy eater's kitchen!";Rejuvenating Taste, Serious Machine, Quiet & Efficient
104;20.0;4.0;45.0;3007;"I bought this item from somewhere else, not from Amazon.  If you search the net, you will be able to buy it for less than what is advertised on Amazon.\n\nThis machine is really slow; it really takes its time to crush and juice the vegetables.  You have to be patient with it and really work--work hard--with the machine, constantly having to push the vegetables down the tube into the crusher, otherwise the vegetables will not go by themselves.  There is no part made available to help you push the vegetables down the tube; you'll have to use the back of a spoon or something sturdy and skinny to push the vegetables along.  However, with all your efforts, you do get a really healthy-tasting juice, which will reduce your appetite after several days.  It takes about half an hour to quickly prepare and juice 8 carrots and 4 celery stalks and to clean the machine.  8 carrots and 4 celery stalks will make about 2 tall glasses of juice.  The machine gets warm after juicing for 10-15 minutes or so, a surprising thing, considering the fact that the machine works so slow.\n\nAs the other reviews have said, the directions that come with this machine are really bad.  But the machine is very easy to figure out.  No problems at all.  The machine comes almost nearly assembled, so you just observe this before you take it apart to clean so you don't lose yourself.  There are no pictures to help you put it back together, so observe the way it looks when you first receive it before you take the assembled parts apart.\n\nOverall, this machine is a really good buy for the person who cares for a superior healthy drink, but if you are pressed for time and rushed in the mornings, you'll want to get something that works faster.";Produces really healthy juice.
105;43.0;4.0;20.0;3089;I got my juicer last week and have used it every day since. I mainly bought it because I read that it was easy to clean, and I'm very satisfied with that aspect. My only complaint is that the instructions that came with it were vague to the point of hilarious, meaning there was no diagram what's so ever to explain what parts the instructions are referring to, and they use pretty industrial names for their parts so it's not exactly intuitive for someone who's never used a juicer before. I eventually played around with it enough to figure it out, but my husband and I had a good laugh about it.;Good Juicer, Bad Instructions

The feed chute is tiny (barely big enough for two fingers), the tray above the chute doesn't hold anything (most things fall out), clean-up is a nightmare, and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice.\n\nStick with a centrifugal juicer like the Breville Elite 800, unless you enjoy torturing yourself.;Terrible product, save your money
108;12.0;5.0;97.0;3273;"After many years of using centrifugal juicers, I purchased an Omega 8003 (exactly the same as the 8005 but in it's color-white). I am concerned not so much whether the centrifugal juicers heat up the juice with their high spin rates, but with the oxidation of the juice. The 8003 only turms at 90-110 rpm and the material gets masticated slowly in a tapering auger inside a fairly tight-fitting outside cone; it appears to me intuitively to cause much less oxidaton and  give a higher quality juice. I have so far juiced kale, spinach, carrots, apples, lemon and oranges, ground up peanuts, and have, for the most part, been pleased with the results. Wheatgrass will be ready in about 8 days, and other reviewers have uniformly praised this unit for juicing wheatgrass. You do have to cut hard fruits and vegetables but this is not too time consuming with a good chef's knife. The machines that take larger pieces of fruit are also themselves larger, for the most part. The Omega 8003 takes up very little counterspace. I prefer to cut carrots lengthwise and then crosswise, remove apple seeds. Apples and carrots give a good juice yield and the greens have done well too. The surpise (pleasant) was oranges. I juiced two med-large navel oranges, removing the rind only, and was delighted to have almost 11 oz of juice, fresh, raw tasting and substantial without being overly pulpy.\n\nCleaning is very easy especially with the supplied brush. You turn the locking wheel on the motor housing (which remains untouched with juice), transport the 5-piece assembly to your kitchen sink, a few simple movements to take apart the 5 pieces and rinse, apply sudsy sponge, and use the supplied brush for the small screens which cleans easily. The whole process takes 2-3 minutes.\n\nWhile some of the machines like the Breville may make a large quantity of juice faster, the time to chop the fruits, offset by the shorter cleaning time, makes this the better machine, especially since you can juice just about everything with it. If you are going to juice something pulpy, like blueberries or ripe peaches (I eat these whole), then finishing the juicing with an appple or carrot will move the pulpy remnant in the drum right through and extract that last bit of juice. With a few little tricks like that, juicing proves very satisfactory. This well built quiet machine which takes up little counter space, is easy to clean (a very big deal), juices just about everything, reasonable in cost (under $200 including shipping, if you know how to search the web), while perhaps a little slower than some machines costing much more, is best for the typical family. It comes with a 10 year warranty (the longest) and the manual states it is suitable for home and commercial use too.";Overall the highest value and best juicer for a variety of juices

Do you want a design with blades (such as the Breville 800JEXL) that will dull with time or one that uses a tough dual stage single gear (that's easy to clean)?\n\nI bought my Omega Juicer 8005 2 months ago off of Ebay for $140.00 (used only a few times).\n\nI juice carrots mainly (mixed in with apples, oranges, and grapes).  I play basketball every week and the energy boost I get from the carrot juice is tremendous.\n\nThe juicer is EXTREMELY EASY to clean.  I can clean all the parts in less than 3 minutes. Anyone claiming it's hard to clean is lazy or works for a competing brand (or both).\n\nYes, you do have to cut the vegetables but so what?  I knew that when I bought it.  I buy the largest carrots and after cutting them up the Omega Juicer handles the pieces very easily.  I have NEVER clogged up my juicer.\n\nIt is recommended that when juicing more than one kind of fruits and vegetables that you should feed half of the carrots first and then feed in whatever other vegetables or fruits and then finish with the last half of carrots to help get everything out.\n\nThe juicer comes with two plastic catch basins, one for the juice and one for the pulp.  And yes the basins will stain over time but so what?  I don't leave them out on the counter anyway.  And yes if you are making more than about 24 oz of juice you will have to empty the catch basin of pulp before your finished.  I think I can handle a few steps to the trash can to empty this out.\n\nI also juice for my wife and 3 of my kids.  And I don't find it difficult at all.  The negative reviews are completely baseless and quite absurd.\n\nI also have never tipped the juicer when utilizing the plunger to feed the vegetable parts.  The one reviewer who says they do obviously hasn't read the instructions or is exaggerating beyond belief.\n\nAnd contrary to the distortions of one reviewer the juice does not come out warm, especially if your vegetables are kept in the refrigerator before use.  Think about it!  How can a juicer that rotates at about 3,600 rpm (Omega) warm something compared to a juicer that rotates at 13,000 (Breville) rpms?\n\nAgain, don't ""drink the koolaid"" of the negative reviewers.  They have no clue what they are talking about!\n\nBuy this juicer with confidence!";One of the best kitchen applicance I own
111;3.0;4.0;971.0;3380;"What I Think\n\nI started thinking about juicing a couple of years ago. Over time I did a little reading on the internet but never thought passed the idea of juicing more than fruit (I'll get to why this important a little later). The cost was also a little more than scary - I always thought I could find a better way to spend $300 or $400 (the price of the ""better"" fruit juicers).\n\nI'm not a health nut, but after a short hospital stay I decided I should take better care of myself. About a month ago I finally bought the Omega 8005 Juicer. Why did I choose this model? Review after review extolled its virtues and the closest competitor, the Green Star Juice Extractor, was more expensive.\n\nThis is one kitchen appliance that is well worth the expense.\n\nWhy Would You Buy This\n\nIf you are only concerned with juicing fruit this isn't the best model for you. It isn't so much cost, a good centrifugal juicer will cost about the same, or more. The issue lies in the straining screen. Pulpy fruits like nectarines clog the screen and you have to take the unit apart to clean it before you can continue juicing (I know this from experience). It can be done and in small quantities isn't that big a deal. But if you never plan to juice leafy vegetables or grasses I'd look elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to juice leafy vegetables or grasses, then you need something like a gear juicer. The Omega fits the bill and is actually less expensive than some fruit juicers. There is also the issue of heat. Some juicers can heat the vegetables because they juice at high-speeds - thus reducing the nutritional value. Here again the Omega fits the bill because it's gear mechanism turns a low rate and is actually less expensive than many other similar units. The Omega can also make nut butters, pasta, and whole host of other things; have I mentioned that the Omega is less expensive than many of its competitors ;).\n\nMore importantly, though, a glass of juice from the Omega contains more delicious vegetable nutrition than I have ever had in a single serving before.\n\nUse/Convenience\n\nI was a little concerned about having to chop up the vegetables and the reports of ""lengthy"" cleaning. Well, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Depending on how much you juice at one time it takes 30-40 minutes, from washing and cutting up the vegetables to finishing up cleaning the last piece of the juicing mechanism (not much more effort than cooking the darn things in my opinion - and I still do a lot of that for dinner).\n\nIf you can clean a blender, the Omega is just as easy.  I always take apart my blender to clean it, so cleaning the Omega wasn't that big a deal - maybe 2 or 3 minutes longer.\n\nTips/Tricks\n\nFirst and foremost, do some research. The internet is chock-full of recipes and tips. Here are a few I picked up either through research or experimentation:\n\n1. Use bitter or pungent vegetables and fruits in moderation - unless you just love chewing on a hunk of ginger, then go for it. Roots like ginger add a nice zing, but can overpower anything else if not used sparingly. Limes add a surprising amount of flavor; I add one-quarter of a small lime - anymore is just too much for me.\n\n2. Peel oranges and grapefruits, but leave the white ""skin"" just under the surface. The rinds can be very bitter to taste and apparently contain minute traces of toxins. Grapefruits fall into the ""pungent"" category for me. When mixing in other fruits I only use 1 grapefruit.\n\n3. If you want to sweeten a drink, use an apple instead of sugar, even in vegetable juice. It works. Trust me.\n\n4. Use pulpy fruit in moderation. This is mostly a cleaning issue with me. I find that I have to take apart the juicing mechanism and rinse it off for *each* piece of pulpy fruit and this gets a little cumbersome when trying to make juice in the morning.\n\n5. It can take a surprising amount of vegetables to make 24 oz of juice. But on the flipside one glass sets you up for the recommended daily allowance for the next day or so.\n\n6. Start your juicing regime slowly. I found out the hard way that it can have an...uh...interesting affect on your digestive tract if you go whole hog too quickly.\n\n7. Experiment. Some mixes are better than others, but in all honestly I haven't found one I didn't at least like.";You Are What You Drink...er...Something Like That
112;109.0;4.0;8.0;3402;After plenty of research on the internet, I decided to go with the Omega 8005. I've used it almost every single day, especially throughout mt pregnancy, to make sure I consumed green leafy vegetables everyday. This is a great juicer and I like it better than my vitamix for making hummus. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like it's grinding ability with small quantities and I think it could leave drier pulp.;Great juicer
113;33.0;5.0;27.0;3436;I felt  compelled to write this review after reading a poor review by another site visitor. I have been juicing for many years and most certainly swear by the Waring's centrifugal juicers for most vegetables. The Waring PJE 101 is superb - very dry pulp and lots of juice!!\n\nI had been looking for  wheatgrass juicers for some time, and, had tried out a number of friends' juicers while visiting them. They are universally average. Blockages, and difficulties cleaning them just put me off purchasing one for quite some time. One lucky day, I visited a smoothie shop and saw their Omega 8003, they used it only for wheat grass. I was quite impressed wth the 8003, it was fast and in the view of those in the shop who cleaned it, very easy to manage (you just unscrew the chimney part and rinse). The staff raved about it, and not just one staff member (there are several in the shop who rotate and because I made a point of asking them about it, they shared their experiences).\n\nI bought the 8005 as a result and am extremely EXTREMELY happy with its simplicity of use, ease of cleaning and perhaps most importantly, the amount of juice it provides. Don't get me wrong, I don't use this for carrots and other larger vegetables, I use my Waring for those, but for wheatgrass (and this is why I bought it), it is the Rolls Royce of juicers!;Best wheat grass user on the market!
114;6.0;1.0;493.0;3470;"I read all the positive reviews, and after using this unit I can only say that those giving the Omega 8005 a positive rating must have either very low standards or nothing better with which to compare.\n\nI have a Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite, arguably the pinnacle of consumer-level juicers. This thing is fast, easy to clean, and exceptionally well designed from a usability standpoint. The industrial design is tremendous, and everything is sized perfectly and makes sense.\n\nThe Omega 8005, unfortunately, doesn't compare. It's feed tube is so incredibly small that you can only feed a single stem of kale at a time, or risk jamming the tube. The Omega 8005 is absolutely useless to juice anything other than grass or simple greens because of its inability to handle a decent quantity at one time. Even the tray that sits atop the feed chute is shallow, narrow, and utterly useless because whatever you put into it quickly falls out.\n\nIt takes me a good 10-15 min. to juice two bunches of parsley and one bunch of kale, excluding clean-up, simply because you have to cautiously feed each item or risk a jam. The amount of juice produced is under 4 oz., enough green juice for one person. If I had to spend 10-15 min. juicing for each person (not including cleanup) in my household, that's a good 45 min. of juicing time plus cleanup.\n\nAlthough the Breville isn't particularly adept at juicing leafy greens, it can produce 8 oz. of juice in under 10 seconds from items such as carrots, apples, oranges, pineapples, tomatoes, grapefruits, etc. Such items make absolutely no sense to juice in the Omega 8005 because it would take an inordinate amount of time to chop everything up into the small 1 inch squares that are required to fit through the feed chute.\n\nWhen the feed chute jamps (quite often), the supplied plunger is inadequate to exert enough leverage to force the produce down the chute. When you do exert force, the entire juicer tips unless you use both hands -- one to force the produce down, the other to physically hold the juicer down.\n\nCleanup is a big chore. The Breville has large, easy parts to rinse, but the Omega 8005 has easily double the number of parts that require cleaning. The parts are smaller, with a lot more nooks and crannies requiring attention.\n\nPhotos of the Omega 8005 show a single container underneath the juicer to catch both juice and pulp, which is ridiculous. The container provided is not large enough to properly catch pulp, unless you enjoy having pulp all over your counter. Contrary to the representations made on the packaging and in the instructions, you need to use two containers: one for the juice and the other for the pulp. This machine contains a multitude of design flaws that are further exacerbated by undersized parts which inhibit usability and functionality.\n\nIt seems to produce slightly more juice from greens than the Breville, although not by a quantity significant enough to mitigate the amount of time and frustration spent in using this underpowered, undersized, and badly designed machine. Juice is very thick and pulpy, with small pepper-sized pieces of the original vegetable present in the juice. Very annoying, especially since none of this is an issue with the Breville.\n\nYou will read people claiming that juice from the Omega 8005 is healthier because it has less froth and is not subject to the ""warming"" of a centrifugal design, thereby retaining more of its nutrients. This could not be farther from the truth. The Omega 8005's single impellar produced plenty of heat from friction, and juice comes out substantially warmed from its cold refrigerator state. I have noticed no such warming in the Breville 800JEXL, and can't help but believe that users of the Omega 8005 once again are deluding themselves into believing marketing hype that simply isn't true (i.e., it's a big lie). As far as froth is concerned, yes, the Omega 8005 produces far less froth -- but at the expense of a pulpier juice with pepper-sized gritty fragments of vegetable in it. Given the choice, I'll take the cleaner juice with the froth and just skim off the froth.\n\nI did not purchase from Amazon, but from another store that had a better price. I wish I had bought from Amazon, as I could probably return the thing now that I've discovered its many flaws. I can't imagine anybody using this to juice anything of any substance -- it would take just too darn long.\n\nIn short: don't buy this machine. Unless you specifically need to juice greens for the maximum amount of extraction and are willing to put up with a badly designed unit, pass this one up and go for the gold: the Breville 800JEXL. You won't regret it.\n\n*** UPDATED 11/13/11 ***\n\nFive years later my Breville 800JEXL is still going strong! All original equipment, nothing has broken or cracked. Juicing basket and blade are still sharp and work like they did on Day #1. Some people have responded to my original review claiming that masticating juicers such as the Omega 8005 produce a higher quality of juice because there is no heating of the juice by a blade and spinning basket. I refrigerate all of my fruits and vegetables prior to juicing, and after running them through the Breville the juice hitting the pitcher is COLD. There is none of this ""heating"" of the juice. It takes literally 5 minutes to juice 24 ounces of ""mean green"" juice as popularized in the documentary ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"". Guess what juicer they used in that film? It takes over 20 minutes to produce the same amount of juice in the Omega, including the time it takes to cut all of your produce into small 1/2 inch pieces. By the time you are done juicing in the Omega, the juice has reached room temperature from sitting while the juice coming out of the Breville is still cold when you drink it. Again, which one loses more nutritional value due to temperature rise in the juice?\n\nSince I posted a negative review of the Omega, several people have called me a corporate ""shill"" and one person even said that I have way too much time on my hands for writing an in-depth, detailed review. I'm constantly surprised by the hateful and mean things people say when you express an opinion that is different from theirs. To those people I can only say this - don't take my review so personally. It's just a juicer! :)";Bad design, too many parts to clean, long juicing time, small capacity
115;18.0;5.0;49.0;3473;I bought this juicer back in December and I absolutely love it.  It takes seconds to assemble and take apart.  All the parts can go into the dishwasher.  Clean up is super easy...it just takes a few seconds to rinse each piece under running water.  There's one attachment that has two screens that have to be cleaned out and at first I thought it'd take forever to get the pulp out of them, but it doesn't.  You just run the brush (included) over the screens a couple of times and they're clean.  The whole thing is really very simple.\n\nMy other concern with this juicer was juicing leafy vegetables.  I wasn't sure that they'd juice well, but they do!  I've juiced romaine, spinach, parsley, beet greens, cabbage, collard greens, chard, kale.  They all come out great!  In fact, everything I've juiced has come out great.  I've juiced everything from canteloupe, to beets, to pineapple, to carrots, apples, all citrus fruits, celery, garlic, onions, berries, kiwi, pears, broccoli stems, sprouts, etc.  I've also made nut butters with this machine.\n\nThe juicer has never made a mess, is pretty quiet, and doesn't take up a ton of counter space.  Not any more than my toaster.\n\nI saw a comment from someone else who said that the plastic stains easily when juicing beets and carrots.  I see how that could happen, but what I do to stop that from happening is, whenever I juice beets or carrots, I simply soak the plastic parts (mainly the pulp and juice containers) in hot water for about five minutes as soon as I'm finished making my juice.  As I said, I've had mine since December and there's not a stain anywhere on it.  If you rinse the parts when you're finished using them to make a dark colored juice, they'll never get stains on them.\n\nI have no complaints at all about this juicer.  It's true that the feeding chute is small and produce needs to be cut into smaller pieces before juicing.  I guess everything is a trade off.  I'd rather spend the extra 5 minutes chopping than to have a machine that will break down on me, is loud, doesn't juice as well, produces warm juice due to high rotation, or makes a mess.  On top of everything else, this machine has a ten year warranty on all parts and labor.  You can't beat that.\n\nI'd recommend the Omega 8005 to anyone who wants a high quality, long lasting juicer.;I LOVE this juicer!!
116;111.0;5.0;8.0;3479;This is a great juicer.  I have to admit it's my first, but I did a lot of research to find just the right one.  I was most concerned with clean up time and low RPM to keep the enzymes from over heating.  This one is slow rpm, and very easy to clean up.  The juice is not warmed too much.  Vegetables juice beautifully.  The pulp comes out nice and dry.  Fruit does well too.  I did blueberrys, they came out rather pulpy and mushy, but still got juice out of them.

118;23.0;4.0;46.0;3500;I purchased an Omega 8005 Juicer and am well pleased with it.\n\nThere is usually very little heat generated (which results in destroying enzymes and causing the juice to spoil faster) and its very easy to clean after use.\n\nIt compares well with masticating juicers (including my Champion) and I rate it (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars-with 5 stars being the best) a 4 and the only reason I don't rate it a 5 is because I also own a Norwalk Juicer (Caddilac of Juicers-retails approximately $2000.00) which is in a class by itself.\n\nThumbs up for Omega!;I purchased an Omega 8005
119;19.0;5.0;49.0;3519;I just bought the omega 8005. I am very impressed with this unit. I have been juicing the last 13 years and this is the fourth juicer I have used. The auger, end cap and hopper are all quality. The fittings are secure and quality. The unit looks good. It is quiet. It leaves very little mess. I don't have to worry about one drip hitting the base motor. Cleanup is quick. I bought it to juice wheatgrass which it does a fine with grass.  The supplied plunger does work, but using a carrot to push the wheatgrass down the opening is much easier and twice as fast. The 10 year warranty is phenomenal on all parts and labor.\n\nI actually use my old centrifugal juicer to juice a glass of carrot juice, and the omega to juice wheatgrass and leafy greens. I believe in using two different tools for two different purposes. If I were only going to juice hard apples and carrots, I would not get this juicer because it would take too long to extract the juice from these.  I would get a centrifugal juicer. But a centrifugal juicer cannot do what this omega can do, namely spinach, parsley and wheatgrass.\n\n---------------------------------\nsix years later....\n\nI have been using it daily. No troubles. No problems. Still working as it did when I bought it. It's been a good purchase.;Great for wheatgrass
120;115.0;4.0;8.0;3595;I have been using this juicer for several weeks and have to say that it does a great job of juicing a wide variety of fruits, veggies, and grasses.  I've done hard and soft items and once you understand juicing order to extract the maximum juice, it becomes very easy.  I use it 2-3 times daily and have other family members using it as well (no small feat).  My only criticism is the smaller feed chute which means more prep time, but for me it's not a deal breaker.  thanks to all who wrote reviews upon which I based my choice of this juicer.;I LIKE IT
121;103.0;5.0;9.0;3624;This is a great juicer for people on the go! It's so easy to clean.  Just detach and rinse. Also, with the continual feed, the pulp is ejected as you juice so no need to stop and clear it out.  The only thing that takes time is cutting the vegetables thin enough to feed into the auger. I am very please with this juicer. Effectively juices leafy greens and grasses. As for the comments about pulpy juice, I don't have this problem and I even stopped using the screen that fits over the juice catching jug. Expensive but worth it if you are a regular juicer.;So easy to clean!!!
122;104.0;5.0;9.0;3758;I am very pleased with this product. It is my first juicer and I have run many fruits and veggies through it. It has no problem with any leafy greens. The pulp comes out very dry. I use it sometimes twice a day. Cleans up very easy.;Very pleased.
123;11.0;5.0;106.0;3758;"This is my first juicer.  I love it.  It came without directions, but was easy to figure out.  (Omega promptly responded to my email and sent the directions.) It makes great juice.  Tastes great, nice consistency, gives a raw food ""jolt.""  I do not notice any change in temperature at all.  I get cold in, cold out; room temperature in, room temperature out.  So easy to clean, which makes it easy to use.  Seeing what happens to whole carrots makes me respect the power of that motor and auger!  I got a hand press juicer for citrus, because it was a hassle to peel oranges before juicing them in the Omega, and oranges are way too bitter and acidic when juiced with the rinds.  Leafy veggies juice very well in the Omega.  What has not juiced well are pomegranites (because I sent a bunch of rind through and it's too much hassle to separate out the seeds; I also got juice all over cutting up the fruit), bananas and figs (both are all pulp).  Melon, apple, pears, carrots, celery, lettuce, kale, spinach, parsley, bok choy, garlic all juice very well.  I let it send the pulp into the sink and send it down the garbage disposal when I am done juicing.  The included ""toothbrush"" is helpful for cleaning the tiny screens.  It can make applesauce and peanut butter, but the peanuts have to be shelled, so I only tried that once.  I am very, very happy with it and use it every day.  It juices as fast as I can cut things up for it.\n\nNote - After a year of almost daily use, I still love it.\n\nJuly '08 update - I do not use it daily any more; a few times a week now. I still love it, no problems, easy to use, even for just a bit of ginger juice (for a half gallon of lemonade), still easy to clean.  Consider a VitaMix, too.  Maybe buy both and keep one.  (I don't have a VitaMix yet, but it is on my wish list.)";Nice juice, easy to use, easy to clean, durable
124;7.0;5.0;225.0;3802;"If you accept that a masticating juicer gives better quality juice than a centrifical, but you do not want a heavy, awkward machine that takes a long time to set up and longer to clean, then this is a great choice. Omega hit the sweet spot with this product. It is light, relatively small, quiet, and cleans rather quickly (the mesh screen is small and does not seem to hold on to the food), while producing fine juice from a variety of plants. (Impressive on celery and spinach; quite good enough on carrots) The result is a masticating juicer that actually gets used, rather than a (perhaps) theoretically superior juicer that is just too much of a hassle to take out. I have a 31 year-old Champion which I really like; I just never use it except when I am fasting, and sometimes not even then.\n\nOne thing should be mentioned. Many single gear juicer ads boast that a slow-turning auger damages the juice less than, say, a Champion because its fast rotation heats the juice and deactivates enzymes and other molecules. Truth is, when I run cold carrots through a Champion, I get cold carrot juice; when I run cold carrots through an Omega 8005, the juice is not warm, but it is definitely not cold. Clearly, if there is less rotation, then the heavy mechanical compression at a certain point produces heat to a greater extent than Champion's rapid rotation does. (I have read one review of another single auger juicer that said its juiced carrots actually came out hot.) Personally, I do not think either type machine actually hurts the juice's chemistry, but Champion should call its single auger competititors on their deceptive claim.\n\nSummary: If you want knock-your-socks off cold carrot juice, get a Champion (although the Omega will still give you a carrot juice high, and, for all I know, its juice will taste just as good if you chill it). If you want bragging rights about the amount of nutrients in your juice, get a Green machine (at almost twice the price, twice the weight, and a long time to clean up). If you want a juicer that probably gives better quality and variety of juices than a centrifical juicer with less noise and no greater cleanup time, get this one. You will actually use it even if you don't have the counter space for it.";A Triumph of Engineering for Real Life Use
125;4.0;5.0;636.0;3803;"I never expected that a juicer could become my favorite kitchen appliance, but here it is! Omega performs beautifully. Here's what I've tested it with:\n\n1) leafy greens (dill, cilantro, parsley, dandelion, kale, parsnip etc.):  extracts lots of dark green juice; leaves very dry pulp.  I haven't tested Omega with wheatgrass yet, but given its performance with other similar-texture greens it should do fine.\n\n2) carrots, beets: approximately half of the volume comes out as juice; pulp is pretty dry.\n\n3) berries (strawberries, raspberries etc.):  most of the volume is juice, but pulp is rather wet.  I had to finish off with carrots to push the soft pulp of the berries through the juicer.  It may be a better idea to blend berries rather than juice them.\n\n4) hard green apples, oranges:  lots of juice, dry pulp.\n\n5) yellow (softer) apples, grapes:  lots of juice, dry pulp, but have to use something hard/fibery at the end (carrots or beets) to push the remaining pulp out.\n\n6) almond butter, walnut butter:  these came out somewhat dry/crumbly, not as smooth as peanut butter; had to add oil.\n\nAdditional features that I like:\n\n1) very quiet, can't even compare to centrifugal models.\n\n2) masticator rotates slowly, so the juice doesn't get heated, hence less nutrients are supposed to get destroyed.\n\n3) Omega squeezes produce cells instead of crushing them at high speed; this preserves more of the larger molecules (amino acids, vitamins etc.) thus making the juice more nutricious.\n\n4) Omega doesn't produce fine-crushed pulp requiring a fine mesh filter (as is the case with centrifugal models), so it's much easier to wash.  There's no fine mesh to clean, which makes the difference between a juicer that ends up used once a year (as was the case with my old centrifugal juicer) and several times each day (as is the case with my Omega).  It's also very satisfying to see that the bulk of the produce is turned into juice and is not lost in soggy pulp.";I love this juicer
126;31.0;5.0;30.0;3917;"The only other juicer I have is an awesome Vita-Mix ""blender"" that leaves in the pulp, so I can't compare the Omega 8005 with any other pulp-free juicer. It's a single-auger masticating juicer with a relatively long warranty.\n\nHowever, the Omega 8005 is pretty darn quiet, easy to clean, and makes some nice vegetable juices (even parsely, kale, ginger root). I like the slow rpm and lack of oxygen exposure - the juice doesn't get mixed up with a lot of air, and it actually comes out almost cool. It also doesn't do any magnetic alterations to the juice, which is what I prefer.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks I've seen. For example, it doesn't seem to do citrus amazingly well. Also, I usually wind up running pulp back through one more time. The input chute isn't very big. Also, when I first put the apparatus together, the way the auger scraped against the screen seemed worrisome - but seems like that's just the way it works.\n\nThat said, though, so far I'm enjoying it, and it's great at what I got it for - cool, not oxidized, non-ionized, liquid vegetable juices.";Good vegetable juices
127;21.0;1.0;51.0;3998;I was very dissapointed with this model. I had been using the Juice Lady juicer and it produced great juice. The only thing negative about the Juice Lady is that it is a little loud and for optimum juice production you have to clean out the spinning screen part every couple of items. I bought the Omega 2005 because other review I read said that it was extremely quiet - which it is. But, I have found that it produces slush instead of juice. I tried mostly carrots and apples and I got very little juicer.. about a fourth of what I would have gotton from my Juice Lady.;Dissapointed
128;29.0;5.0;33.0;4024;I'm new to juicing.  My husband bought me the Omega 8005 for Christmas, and I've found it very easy to operate and clean.  So far I've juiced an unpeeled lemon, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, watercress, beets, ginger root, apple, orange, and cranberries.  It works very well.  The pulp comes out dry.  It works best when I'm patient and don't cram too much in at a time.  I highly recommend this product.;I love my juicer!
129;1.0;5.0;1427.0;4033;I used to have an ACME centrifugal juicer. I thought I would never like any juicer better than the ACME because it made good juice and was very easy to clean. The only drawback to a centrifugal juicer is it won't extract much juice from leafy green vegetables and won't juice wheatgrass.\nI got this Omega 8005 juicer because I wanted to be able to juice greens and wheat grass as well as root vegetables. I read on a forum that this new Omega juicer is the best there is for under $400. This Omega juicer is even easier to clean than the ACME, which is a big issue because in the long run you won't use a juicer if its a hassle to clean. And it squeezes all the juice out of anything I put in it. The pulp comes out very dry. It is super quiet too and the ACME was loud.\nThe Omega runs at a low rpm so it doesn't kill enzymes and stuff like that, so its supposed to make healthier juice than a Champion or centrifugal juicer.\nIts a pleasure to use. I make juice every day now. I love getting all the nutrients that I need regularly. It helps my body recover from surfing everyday.\nThe juicer is very well built and very simple. It seems like it will last a long time and it has a very long warranty.\nYou can tell that I love this juicer, eh?\n\nEdit: It's now 2009 and I've had this juicer almost five years. I still use it just about every day. I still love it. The juicing screen started to wear out a few months ago. I emailed Omega and they sent me a new one for free. They certainly stand by their 10 year warranty. I am comforted to know that if anything else should happen, I still have five more years of no questions asked replacement.;The best juicer I've ever had

0;1.0;1.0;200.0;0;This wireless printer has a known, unresolved issue. The issue has something to do with a dynamic IP address that periodically forces the printer offline. The simple solution was to uninstall and start over from scratch. Every month or so I would play that game much to my annoyance. The month my mother died from a lightning-fast lung cancer, I did not have the patience to fight with my printer. I needed to print out copies of her death certificate and begin the process of closing out her affairs. The printer was offline. I called customer service. After a lengthy hold and close to an hour of fruitless tech support, the technician sent me to grab my USB cable downstairs. When I returned a minute later with the cable, the technician had hung up on me. I proceeded to rip the power cord out from my printer, carry the thing to my front walkway, and smash it into a thousand bits. O Brother, where art thou?;Pure Frustration
1;41.0;5.0;5.0;77;Previous model has lasted 4 yrs.  ( actually still functions) I purchased this as a backup.  I have a business and this printer sits out in the warehouse and prints workorders.  90 + summer heat down to 20 - 30 degree winter temps.  Humidity and all the rest.  Drum takes longer to print in the colder months but that is usually only the first print of the morning.  Best thing is toner if you buy the xl is a great value;Best thing is toner if you buy the xl is ...
2;12.0;5.0;29.0;120;Setup: The printer came with a very detailed guide that made setuo quick and easy. In less than 10 minutes I had it connected to my computer, added to google cloud print (unfortunately it is not cloud ready so it had to be added as a classic printer), and successfully printed a few test pages from three different devices: my desctop pc, my macbook pro, and my moto x(using cloud print).\n\nPrint speed: This thing prints insanely fast compared to my old hp touchsmart laserjet. I am a computer science major so I have to print lots of pages and this thing blazed through 13 pages of source code in less than 30 seconds(time from hitting print to it being done printing).\n\nPrint quality: The only printers I have used before were inkjets and the difference in quality is amazing. The printing is so sharp that even 2pt font was readable(with a magnifying glass!).\n\nPrice per page: the initial started cartridge lasts ~700 pages. After that the toner to buy is TN450 which currently retails here on amazon for $46.34, with an estimate lifespan of ~2,600 pages. From what I've read in the reviews of the toner that seems to be a pretty accurate estimate.  So the price per page comes out to roughly 1.8 cents per page. That's amazing coming from using a laserjet with ink that cost anywhere from $20-$30 depending on the time of year and only lasted for a few hundred pages.\n\nQuality of refurbish: When I opened the box there were no signs with was a refurbished printer. The box was in new condition, it had all of the original documentation, no scuffs or marks on the printer, and all the parts I saw while doing initial setup looked new. All of the refurbished brother printers also come with the same one year warranty as the new ones, so as far as i'm concerned I just got a new printer for ~$50 off of the list price.;Best printer I have ever used!
3;20.0;4.0;15.0;122;We have the non-refurbished one, so I can't speak for the differences. We use it for every day printing- very quick, does duplex with no problems. It can handle cardstock with  ease. It does cry wolf about toner quite a bit- we had the toner warning for almost a year before it finally gave out.\nI won't say wireless setup is a breeze on XP, but Windows 8 recognized it automatically which was nice.;Good Value
4;31.0;5.0;9.0;122;Cheapest laser printer with wireless.\nDefinitely a good buy during lightning deals.\nValue for money! Love it!\n\nWe bough the toner together:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YZB0X8?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B004YZB0X8&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=EWECUFJVWSMWOVGY\n\nCheers!;Cheapest laser printer with wireless.
5;28.0;4.0;10.0;141;The install and wireless setup was harder than it should have been but I was able to get it working to print from our Macbooks. Haven't tried the iPad yet but it's a fast printing, small profile economical choice for a printer.;difficult setup but fine printer
6;53.0;5.0;5.0;167;Great little printer for the money. Had a predecessor of this model and it served me well. Got this because the old one did not have wifi connection.;Great little printer for the money
7;10.0;4.0;44.0;203;My wife and I homeschool our children and we print a lot.  We wanted something that was B&W, could duplex print (front and back), was wireless, and was fast.  We have an old HP LaserJet 4+ that wasn't wireless, was heavy, big, and didn't duplex, plus the front rollers were having issues and would cause paper jams.  It was time for something new.\n\nThis model fit the bill and the refurb price fit my wallet.  We've had it for about a month now and its been great.  Setup wasn't bad, but the Web GUI is not super intuitive and looks like minimal effort went into the design.  I'd have given it 5 stars if that was better.  Still, setup didn't take too long and once it was on the network and the print server was running I was off.  I was even able to set it up to work with my Synology NAS to work as a remote print server.  We're super happy so far.  Print speed is good, even with duplex.  Its a little noisy but what printer isn't.  Wakes and warms up quickly and I love the flexibility of the wireless.  I plan to go the cheap route with replacement toner vs a whole cartridge when the time comes.  If I remember I'll update my review to let you know how that goes.;Great little printer for the price
8;59.0;1.0;5.0;242;The printer is a pain to install, which requires use of a usb cable even if you intend to use it over a wifi network. In the 30 days I've owned it, it simply stopped printing documents several times. This required re-installation of the drivers in order to get it working properly again. Compared to previous brother printers I have owned, this model is a let down in terms of quality.;Problems with installation and drivers
9;32.0;1.0;13.0;258;"We have all used laser printers and copiers that give ""low toner indicators"" of one form or another. Nothing wrong with that. What Brother has done of late, since the last Brother Printer I bought, is to put hard shutoffs on their printers that disable the machine entirely when a sensor in the machine says the toner is low. This is obviously to gin up toner sales in a dishonest way. The cartridges are FAR from empty when the machine shuts off and tells you to install a new cartridge. There are workarounds for this online.\n\nThe worst part is that the devices are so cheaply made that otherwise trivial internal switches and sensors in the machine, should they break or wear out, signal there is no toner and shut the machine down entirely. This is what happened to me, brand new printer, not even halfway through one toner cartridge. Machine just shuts down. I install a new cartridge, toner light still on, machine still entirely nonfunctional.\n\nIf they weren't so greedy and dishonest in milking toner sales, this kind of thing wouldn't happen. No printer or copier should EVER shut entirely down due to an internal toner sensor. That leaves the door open to this kind of cheap, ripoff crap. Avoid this brand, especially any models with toner sensors that shut down the machine entirely.";Warning, Brother Printers with Toner Indicator Lights are SCAM Devices, Outrageous RIPOFF, dishonest company
10;43.0;1.0;8.0;259;I've had this printer for 3 years, and finally been frustrated with it enough to literally smash it into the ground.\n\nThe wireless link is so UNRELIABLE that you should only consider it a wired printer. Seriously. I work in the tech industry, and am freaking incredible with computers and am a serious electronics tinkerer, and this printer is a piece of crap. Longest the wireless worked without any issues was about 1 month.\n\nDoesn't sound too bad you say? Well consider you have to do this *each* time the printer decides to act up:\n1. Dig out the damn printer out and haul it over to your computer (think about that, since it's wireless, you'll want to put it somewhere far and hidden away)\n2. Go to device manager on your PC -> delete/uninstall drivers\n3. Plug in the damn piece of crap to your computer via usb\n4. Reinstall drivers. Reconfigure printer and wireless settings\n\nPrinter works great after this! UNTIL IT FRIGGIN GOES TO SLEEP, will randomly stop working again.\n\nYes Brother provides troubleshooting utilities, oh wait, they're completely and utterly useless.\n\nYes, I've assigned a static IP to the printer on the network hub (DHCP).\n\nAvoid, avoid, AVOID this piece of crap. It is utterly UNRELIABLE. It'll be printing great day, then the next day when you have 5 minutes to print and make it to a meeting, guess what? SPLOOOOGES, UNRESPONSIVE. PIECE OF CRAP.;NEWSFLASH: NOT A WIRELESS PRINTER.
11;63.0;1.0;5.0;278;I gave one star because it is not possible to give ZERO. I purchased this printer based on the number of positive reviews. There seemed to be other Mac users who were able to get the thing to work on a wireless network, though many said that hooking it up was difficult. I am assuming that they are running older OS X versions. Difficult does not begin to describe my experience with trying to get this printer to work! I have just spent my entire afternoon on it, and still have no wireless printer. I use OS X Maverics, and there seems to be no driver that will get this thing to work wirelessly, even though Brother's website states that it will. I do not have more time to devote to this, and I am not happy about all of the time I have wasted. I am have already repacked the printer in its box and am waiting for UPS to come get it.\n\nUPDATE: After much research, I have found that in order to work wirelessly with OS X Mavericks, a printer needs to be AirPrint enabled. This printer does NOT interface with AirPrint, and therefore, will not work with the newest version on OS X (10.9.2). Here is a link to Apple Support which contains a very long list of printers that ARE AirPrint enabled: [...]\n\nI note that none of the lower priced laser models seem to be included on the list. :-(\n\nBecause Brother does offer other printers that are AirPrint enabled, they obviously understand what is involved. It is my opinion that they are falsely advertising this printer. They need to include a note to consumers telling them that it will not work wirelessly with the newest Mac operating system, or that it is wireless for PC users only.\n\nBOTTOM LINE on this printer is if you are running Mavericks on your Mac, the Brother HL-2270DW will need to be attached with a USB cable. You will not be able to print from wireless devices such as an iPhone or iPad.;Mac users BEWARE
12;62.0;1.0;5.0;278;"I had this printer for a little while, and my toner still had ink in it, but the printer drivers were designed to monitor how many times you've printed, and so it told me it was out of toner and wouldn't let me print even though there was still ink left.  This seems wasteful and dishonest; trying to force you to buy toner sooner than is necessary.  Will never buy Brother products again.";Tries to scam you into buying toner too soon
13;54.0;1.0;7.0;352;"First let me say that setting this thing up for wireless on my Mac network required a lot of work and patience. I'm pretty technical, so kept at it, but the average user may not be able to get through this. I finally got it working and was happy with everything until, several weeks later, my network couldn't find the printer anymore. I had to move my printer next to the router and connect it directly to the router, then run the wifi ""wizard,"" which it is not. After a couple of attempts, the ""wizard"" still couldn't see the hardwired printer. So, I decided to reset it to the original manufacturer's state and start over.\n\nThink resetting it was easy? Nope. You have to power off the printer, then hold down the green Go button until all the LEDs light up except for the ""Ready"" LED. Next, release Go and make sure all the LEDs turn off. Then, press Go six times (better count right!), and make sure that all the LEDs light up. There, it's done! Where'd Brother get this sequence, out of a 1980s printer manual? Why not just give us some dip switches to play with?\n\nI then ran the wifi wizard again, and it found the printer. The next step was associating it with my network. I entered they key, printed a page, disconnected it from the router, and printed another page. Voila, it worked! I turned off the printer and moved it back to its location, turned it on, printed a test page, and it worked! Until about an hour later when I tried printing something again. My network couldn't find the printer again.\n\nI went through this one more time, with exactly the same results. As I write this, I cannot print across the network. So now the only way to print is to keep it hardwired to my router in a very inconvenient location. This printer is junk, and will soon be in my junk bin after I find a good replacement.\n\nIt is really hard to believe that Brother uses such crude technology in this day and age. Last Brother printer I will ever buy.";MAC + HL-2270DW = 0
14;73.0;1.0;5.0;357;Running OSX 10.9, and I have an airport express router. I was not able to make the printer work. Not wirelessly, not connected to the router, not even connected to the computer via USB cable.;Could NOT make it work
15;55.0;4.0;7.0;415;"UPDATE Jan 1, 2014:\nI finally replaced the sample toner cartridge that came with the printer.  I had roughly 800 pages printed on the sample toner.  I purchased an aftermarket replacement toner and it works perfectly.  I have no idea how many pages it will yield, but the toner cost me approximately $13 versus around $45 for an original brother toner. Even if I get half of the yield, its still worth it to go for an aftermarket toner.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI have owned several brother laser printers and not a single one of them has broken down on me yet.\n\nI own two of the HL-2270DW.  The first one is connected directly to my router through an ethernet connection.  The other printer is connected through wifi.  The wifi setup is fairly simple if you're computer savvy.\n\nThe printer is very small and it fits very conveniently in the bottom shelf of my closet!  So great!  It automatically prints double sided without having to reload the pages and figure out all that nonsense.\n\nMy only complaint about this printer is that the software tells you that you are out of toner way before you are actually out of toner!  It can be really frustrating because it just won't allow you to print.  But don't worry!!!  There is a way to continue printing.  Follow these instructions:\n\nSTEP 1: open the front cover of your printer and leave it open\nSTEP 2: Turn the printer off using the on/off switch\nSTEP 3: Hold down the ""go/start"" button while turning the printer back on.  You should see all of the lights turn on\nSTEP 4: Release the ""go/start"" button\nSTEP 5: Press the ""go/start"" button 2 times. You should now see all the lights turn on\nSTEP 6: Press the ""go/start"" button 5 times.  Once you do this, the toner light should be offer and you may see the error light flashing.\nSTEP 7: Close the cover and the ready light should be the only light that is on";Great printer over all.  1 star docked because of crappy software that doesn't let you print when you still have toner.
16;17.0;1.0;36.0;475;Provider does not honor their warranty. The printer was ordered on the 22nd received on the 27th and died in less then 30 days. The provider counted the 30 return from date of order not receipt. Can you believe it lasted less then 30 days and the toner sensor went out. Don't expect a replacement since they will obviously will not honor it. I did like the product, but the provider obviously will not back their items so do not waste your money or time.;Warranty Not Honored
17;81.0;1.0;5.0;495;The price for the product was great.  At the time I bought it in Feb 2013, it was offered at $89!  The printing is fine and the toner replacements available on Amazon are reasonably priced.  But the noise this printer make is loud and continuous long after printing has stopped.  The first machine that I had kept running the fan for an hour or more after printing a single page.  Brother is aware that there is a noise problem and did agree to replace my printer.  Brother made the exchange quite easy, and paid shipping in both directions.  The replacement printer shuts of the fan after about 15 minutes, but the noise is still too loud and long for a desktop printer.  This has got to be a software problem, so I updated the firmware to the latest release, but found no relief.  I've used Brother printers at home for many, many years, but this is a big disappointment.  Beware.;Too much noise!
18;72.0;1.0;6.0;506;We purchased this printer, it worked fine for three weeks and the duplex feauture stop working. We returned it for a replacement in May 2013. Today the WiFi stop network stopped working. We print an average of 20 duplexs a week a month. I would not recommend this product. Two defective printer in three months. Bad product.;Do not purchase
19;74.0;1.0;6.0;522;I spent a whole afternoon and finally got it settled. After printing my first file, I thought it should be OK, BUT it is not! The next day when I want to use it I found it always offline no matter what you do- I tried restarting it, reset it and everything I could have done. But the other day it magically recovered! It's really a matter of luck when you want to use this printer! BTW, the one I got missed the last 2 pages in the manual, I don't really know if it is a refurbished one or not! Very unhappy about this purchase!;"Always ""OFFLINE"""
20;75.0;1.0;6.0;525;"After hours on the phone with support, we finally got it to work.  That is, we got the wireless connection to work on the network.\n\nThen it went off line, and I used the Brother Network Tool that I downloaded in the past and it worked again.\n\nThen it went off line and this time the tool doesn't work.  So I start down a long trouble shooting methodology that Brother sent me the last time.  That didn't work.\n\nSo I tried to just get it to handshake with pushing the Netgear button and having the Brother search for the connection.  That doesn't work.\n\nMeanwhile, it sets next to a Cannon wireless color inkjet I use for photos.  That worked right away and never goes offline.\n\nI had similar issues with the prior Brother model but once it got locked in, it seemed OK for the long haul.\n\nIn short - this printer is hit and miss as a wireless printer and support is hit and miss as well.  If you want it, wire it.  Otherwise, find something else.\n\nUpdate - since writing this review I have reviewed the documentation on my Netgear router.  I followed those instructions.  I got a Brother printout  that said ""Connection OK"".  But when I pull up the printer it still shows offline.  Wish I could give half a star.";Wireless is hit and miss

22;44.0;3.0;11.0;537;"Edited July 28, 2013 to add:\nWell I've Googled the crap out of fixing the crooked printing issue. No joy. Then I removed the printer's toner drum and replaced it, making absolutely sure it was fully clicked in on both sides. That did help fix the crooked printing some. It's still not PERFECTLY straight, which I think it should be, but it's passable. Overall, (and remember I've only been using this printer for one day so far) this machine works fine. I'll review more as time goes on.\n\nOriginal review: July 27, 2013: My 2-year old Canon bit it last week and since I was sick and tired of shelling out a small fortune for inkjet ink every year I figured I'd check out a laser printer instead. I figure we RARELY used the color on the inkjet anyway and it was a big ol' PITA to keep the ink supply up.\n\nAfter MUCH hemming, hawing, gnashing of teeth and wringing of hands as well as reading (no kidding) over 50 reviews on every brand of laser printer under $400, I finally decided on this one.\n\nI went to Office Max to get it -- yes I paid a little more than if I had ordered it on Amazon but I'm so gun-shy about printers that I wanted a STORE to be able to take it back to if something went horribly wrong. So I paid $149 PLUS the extra $50 for a 3-year extended warranty because although I think extended warranties are mostly profit centers for retailers, I DO want some recourse if/when something goes wrong in the next three years. Which it's likely to because all printers are seemingly built in China by four-year olds, using the cheapest quality components and when a squirrel farts, they stop working. But I digress...\n\nWe're a Mac household and without going into excruciating detail, IF I had wanted to run this printer using a USB directly to my laptop, it would have worked immediately. Because it did when I tried it that way. You just plug it in and it works. But I didn't buy a *WIRELESS* printer so I could hard wire it to my computer, right? So I pop the install software disc into my laptop drive and the software wouldn't work on my Macbook Pro (running OS10.8.4 Mountain Lion). Awesome!\n\nSoooo I went to the Brother website and tried to download the wireless setup wizard software. I chose my operating system from a list, clicked DOWNLOAD, and although the software worked to a point, when it came to the window to choose my wifi network that I wanted to connect the printer to, it would NOT respond. Nothing. Clickety clickety clickety click. NOTHING. I had to Force Quit the process and just for fun I started it over again. With the exact same result. So close, yet so far! Drat.\n\nSoooo then I call the Office Max Essentials Support phone number (877-MAX-CTRL) which comes with the $50 / 3 years extra warranty. Surely they can resolve my issue. Nope! They cheerfully say they can't help me because THEY DON'T OFFER SERVICE OR SUPPORT ADVICE FOR APPLE MACHINES. That would have been nice to know when I was at Office Max, but okay, back to the drawing board. (Or the draw-ring board if you're a Brit)\n\nThen my sweet husband gets a flash of brilliance! It occurred to him that we each run two different version of Apple OS. My laptop runs 10.8 Mt. Lion but HIS is still on Lion (10.7)...\n\nSo on his laptop, we go back to the Brother website and download the wireless setup software for OS7.5 and KABLAM it works like a freakin' charm! Step by step all the way through, easy peasy, like a piece of cake, we're able to configure the printer to get onto our home wifi network.\n\nOnce the printer has been configured to be on the network, we each take our laptops and go into System Settings > Print & Scan > Add Printer and KABLAM there's the Brother printer, showing up waiting to be added to our machines, just as pretty as it can be. We select the printer, it adds to the existing list of devices, then we right click it to make it the default and call it a day.\n\nThe whole thing took the better part of an hour -- HOWEVER, had the Brother install and wireless setup software not had the Mac OS8 bug, it would have literally taken ten minutes to get the thing configured. So if you're running OS8 good luck! Heck, we probably could have borrowed someone's PC just to get the printer onto our home wifi network, but thankfully the OS7 software worked fine.\n\nAs for print quality, it prints pretty quietly and the quality is crisp and clear BUT every printed sheet comes out slightly askew. I have loaded and RE-loaded the paper into the tray but printing is still not straight and it's starting to piss me off. I'll research to see if there is some ""print head alignment"" thing I can do to fix that.\n\nAlso, I like that you can go into the printer preferences and set all kinds of default settings such as Toner Save, 300dpi rather than the default 600dpi, turn on or off duplex printing, etc. Remember that on a Mac, to set default printer preferences you must actually be IN the process of printing a document to set those settings. And before you hit PRINT, you click the dropdown menu that says ""Presets"" and select ""Set current settings as default"". That will hold your new settings as defaults. ALSO I gave my custom settings a name just so I could be sure it was using them every time I printed)\n\nI will update my review when I learn more about how to fix this crooked printing thing.";Mac users take note!
23;88.0;1.0;5.0;590;"I've had several Brother B&W laser printers in the past and this is BY FAR the very WORST.  They went too far to build it cheaply.  The toner cartridge is far too small.  After just a few months the drum started printing ""shadowing"" on printouts.  The printer receives info slowly, even though its print speed is pretty good.  The wireless does NOT work if you also want to have it set up as a hard wired printer.  The ""print count"" gear on the cartridge is such a scam, and if you don't want to throw away a bunch of toner, you'll have to mess with it;  if you were unfortunate enough to buy this printer, make sure you learn how to go into ""continue"" mode to print the rest of the toner.";Brother HL-2270DN a waste of money
24;42.0;4.0;14.0;614;"I just got my printer today. It prints fantastically and is a heck of a lot faster than my Epson InkJet - I am a laser printer fan from here out. So in reviewing the printer, it's great and setup on my Dell Laptop was a snap.\n\nAs for interfacing with my wife's Mac, that's a whole different story. As many have mentioned and as disclosed in the product description, the included CD-ROM does not have driver installation for any software newer than Snow Leopard (10.6). Anyone using Lion or newer needs to go onto the Brother website and fairly easily install the drivers. I am runnning 10.7.5 and there was an additional software update available by just running my Apple software update tool. It prints fine when connected via USB to the printer.\n\nHere's where people seem to run into issues when printing wirelessly. Let me be clear, there is an issue with Apple 10.7 printing wirelessly. However, it is not an issue with Brother or the printer. A bit of light internet research will show you that when people upgraded to Lion (10.7) their wireless printing capabilities went haywire. I've seen people mention issues with every type of printer imaginable. With our old Epson, the same issue came up when we upgraded. So the blaming of Brother for network issues is misguided. It is an Apple issue and as I write this at 2:30am, I've been trying to find an answer to the problem for the last 4 hours with no luck. People have mentioned that Apple seems to pass the buck when it comes to issues with this - they gave up on 10.7 bug fixes a long time ago. As of right now, I'm not sure where to go with this and it looks like it isn't going to be resolved tonight.\n\nAs a long-time loyal Apple fan, I have to be honest that I'm a bit dissapointed. I have never once had an issue like this - they are usually reserved on a frequent basis for my Windows machines. All that aside, I wanted to provide a review in reponse to some of the criticism Brother is receiving regarding this issue. I will update my post when (if?) I can resolve this issue.\n\n******UPDATE******\n\nAfter hours of tinkering, I figured out how to fix it. To start from the beginning of the install:\n\n1. Go to the Brother-usa.com homepage and find your model.\n2. Download the applicable drivers for your software.\n3. Run the programs. One is an installer, the other is a wireless network setup. There should be two other firmware programs as well.\n4. Run your Apple Software update.\n5. Install the new software for the printer.\n6. Restart the computer.\n7. It should have printed already when the printer first booted, but you need to have the printer IP address. You can access it through your network configuration or go to the printer in Preferences and it should show it there.\n8. Write down the printer IP address.\n9. If you haven't already pulled up your printer in System Preferences, pull it up. Hit the ""-"" button on the left hand middle side to erase your previously installed printer. You're not undoing anything you just did, you're just removing the old version and asking your system to recognize the new and updated version of the printer.\n10. Now that you have erased the device, click the ""+"" button to add a device. The printer wasn't immediately recognized under the default tab at the top so I went over to IP, kept the protocol as LPD and typed in the printer IP address in the address line. The name populated below and I added that device.\n\nNot sure if this is a permanant fix or if I just screwed around enough and got something to be able to print but now I can send docs from my Mac just fine. Feel free to leave comments and I'll try to respond if you have questions - I'm not an IT guy, just someone who is too proud to let a machine beat me!";Read this if you are going to be using with Apple
25;89.0;1.0;5.0;616;Title pretty much says it all.  We picked up two for the office and one for the house.  None of them were high volume.  The one at the house started having problems first, and then one at the office started acting up.  It appears to be a problem with the security chip in the 'authentic' brother cartridges.  Nice to know they are more interested in stopping people from using non brother cartridges then giving people a printer that works.  And no, we never used non brother cartridges.\n  One of the new HPs arrived today, and I anticipate ordering more shortly.  Our flirtation with cheap, and I do mean that in the worse way, laser printers is over.;Purchased three and a year later only one is working.

Then, I was printing about 100 pages and half-way through the Toner light came on and the printer refused to print anymore. I turned it off, turned it on, cancelled my print job, tried to reprint just 1 page; it just refused to print!\n\nSo I go on Google, and can't believe what I'm reading. Brother has a page counter in place that literally shuts down the printer once you've printed what they think is the right amount of pages for your toner cartridge. I used the reset process, and printed another 300+ pages before the ink even started to get light/faint. So basically they have a process in place that forces you to throw away good toner, and I've heard you have to do the reset thing as well if you don't buy a Brother toner cartridge.\n\nNeedless to say, I won't be buying any more Brother products.\n\nHere's the reset process:\n\n- Open the front cover and leave open while completing the following steps.\n- Turn the printer off.\n- Hold the 'go' button (or ""start' button) while turning the printer on. All panel lights should be on.\n- Release the 'go' button (or ""start' button).\n- Press the 'go' button (or ""start' button) 2 times.\n- Pause. Wait for all panel lights to come on.\n- Press the 'go' button (or ""start' button) 5 times.\nThe toner light should be off. (error may be flashing)\nThe paper light should be on or flashing.\n- Close cover. The ready light should be the only light on.";Fine printer, but Brother has logic in place to prevent you from using all your toner
27;80.0;3.0;6.0;656;I'm writing this because I see that in another review an individual was rather snotty about folks who complained about this printer drawing a lot of power. That reviewer told people to upgrade the wiring in their homes.\n\nSo let me give you a real-world example.\n\nI have running on the same circuit in my home two computers, an HP laser printer, a flatscreen TV, home theater system with an enormous power amplifier, and numerous floor lamps. All of this ran flawlessly simultaneously. The HP printer had become obsolete  it couldn't be networked. So, I bought the HL-2270DW. Now, even if I turn everything else off except for one computer, the Brother makes the ceiling lights flicker during operation. I actually had to run an extension cord to a distant outlet because initially I had it hooked up to one of the several APC UPS's in the room and it would trip the alarm on the thing!\n\nSo, while I do think the features on the printer are great, keep in mind that it has an enormous momentary power draw in operation.;Power-hungry

First, let me say that I am rating this printer 5 stars due to print quality and build quality. But I will also confess to having gone through a day of trial and error and subsequent temper tantrums trying to make the damn thing print wirelessly! I was ready to give it a one star review and join the ranks of the upset and the displeased.\n\nThen I hit the user forums at Apple.com and some genius had found the answer to my dilemma. I will share it here.\n\nUsing the directions in the box, set it up with a USB cable. The literature is straightforward. You will probably have to download the updated Wizard from the Brother website, but no big deal there. Download it and run it in accordance with the guide from the box.\n\nAfter you have 'paired' your printer with your wifi network the wizard will tell you to disconnect your USB cable. And your damn printer won't print wirelessly, even though you followed the directions perfectly. I did. FIVE TIMES. And it still wouldn't print.\n\nTake a deep breath. Open ""Print & Scan"" preferences on your Mac. You'll see the Brother listed there as an available printer. Delete it, and then add it again. See, MAC OS only recognizes it as being connected via USB until you add it again, at which point MAC OS now recognizes it as a wireless printer on your network. I just about cried when my first page printed over the air. My dog looked at me like I was an idiot. Maybe I am, but I am also a happy camper printing wirelessly from across the room!\n\n13 inch MacBook Pro running MAC OS X 10.7.5\n\nHappy printing,\nChris\n\nps.

32;85.0;1.0;6.0;809;I just set up this printer and can't believe my ears. The problem is not so much the noise that the machine makes while printing (although that is loud enough) but the fan that stays on after printing. It is high-pitched and goes on for 13 minutes before finally shutting off. My partner has an old HP Laserjet P1006 than is smaller and makes no fan noise at all. A fan that runs for 13 minutes after printing, at this level of noise, is a serious design flaw.;Intolerable fan noise

At a cost of $45/ea for Brother cartridges, it could have cost me $135 for toner on a $90 printer. Fortunately, I only bought 1 Brother cartridge & 2 knock offs.  Long story short, Brother has changed the configuration of their printers so they stop printing at the point pages are no longer the ""maximum desirable quality"", per Brother's specs, regardless of how much toner is left in the cartridge.  This feature can be turned off so the printer continues to print until you run out of toner or want a new cartridge, however, it took me a year and 30 painful minutes on the phone with Brother to figure this out.";Prints Great - Burns thru Toner Cartridges

35;21.0;5.0;39.0;844;"So far it's a great little printer for a great little price!  We bought this because we already have an ink jet all-in-one multi-function printer that has like all who came here before her quit printing after very few months of service. We don't really need a color printer. And, we wanted a printer that would be compatible with our iPad/iPhones. We've only been using it a few days, so how long it prints remains to be seen, but the other reviews lead me to believe switching to a laser printer and this model will serve us well for a while. Even if it only works for a year we will have not flushed nearly the amount of cash on it. That said, if it dies within a short time, I may update this review.\n\nAlthough I did a good bit of comparison shopping and read lots of reviews, initially we thought we had ordered the wrong printer for our needs. The wireless set-up was a breeze. Brother's website directed us to download ""Brother iPrint&Label"" app to use our iPad/iPhones. It didn't work. We also found an app, ""Brother iPrint&Scan"" which also didn't work. After further research on Brother's web site we found that this printer was not suppose to be compatible with iPad/iPhone iOS. I went back to read the information on Amazon.com and it appeared we needed to move up to a more expensive model. But the comparison chart showed this printer worked with ""Cortado Workplace"". A quick check in the App Store and we located the free app. Cortado is a free App and you sign up for an account which gives you 2 GB of free cloud storage. It works great!\n\nI read reviews all the time when purchasing new items and find them often very helpful, but confess that I don't very often write one.  Because we almost spent the money to ship this one back and then more to buy a more expensive printer, I felt adding our experience might save others a lot of headache and money. Hopefully it will.";Great Printer - Is Compatible with iPad/iPhone
36;4.0;4.0;459.0;854;After going through another $56 set of inks on my inkjet printer, I decided enough is enough. I don't need to print documents in color and I no longer print photos at home because Costco and Walmart are cheap and easy (and better). This Brother laser printer was my solution.\n\nI give the printer high marks: the print quality can be set at three different levels and the two highest levels are superb. Also it duplex prints (both sides) and does a good job at that. Printing envelopes via the 'straight-through' path is easy and has made my label machine less useful.\n\nAs with so many tech units, it's the setup that is the hassle. I am a Mac person. Sure, I've used PCs at work and when I have to but I much prefer the Mac OS. The first indication that there was trouble was when the included setup disk refused to install the printer drivers because they were outdated. There was no link to update, no advice, nothing. So I went to the Brother site and after digging around through their horrible UI, I found the necessary updated drivers, downloaded and installed them. But that was only the start of the hassle.\n\nThe user manual is horribly confusing, to say the least, when it comes to setting up the wireless networking (at least to me). I suggest you ignore everything in the manual regarding networking. Let me give you Mac users some hints so you can avoid the wasted time and frustration I experienced:\n\n[Update: June 2015: Apple's OS X now includes printer drivers for most manufacturers, so step 1 may not be necessary. If the setup prompts you for a driver, Google the printer model number and you should find it quickly. Note: After nearly 3 years, I continue to receive personal thanks for this review. I'm grateful I could help so many people].\n\n1. After you've unpacked the printer, installed the toner and paper and printed a test page, go to the Apple web site and search for Brother printer drivers. Apple has all the latest drivers for download free.\n2. Download and install the drivers.\n3. Insert the CD that came with the printer and open the 'Utilities' folder. Do NOT use the 'Start Here OSX' icon.\n4. In the Utilities folder, click on 'Wireless Device Setup Wizard.'\n5. In the next window, Setting Up Wireless, click 'NO' then 'Next.'\n6. In the next window, click 'checked and confirmed' then 'Next' (you don't need to read the stuff in that box).\n7. In the next window, make sure 'Temporarily use USB cable' is selected, then click 'Next.'\n8. Connect a USB cable from your computer to the printer.\n9. In the next window, you will see the setup software searching for wireless signals in your area. Make sure your network is visible, then select it.\n10. In the next window, input your router's wireless access password twice as requested. (Note: if you have an Apple Airport, do not enter the Airport PW, but your wireless access PW. If they are the same, no worries.)\n11. Unplug the USB cable to the printer.\n12. Click through to 'finish' and you are done!\n[Update Aug 2014}\nMany have commented that to make their printer work, they took an additional step. Here it is:\n13. Be certain the printer is ON. Go to System Prefs>Printers & Scanners. If you see a Brother printer in the pane, it is likely the wired version setup placed there automatically during the setup process. Delete it. Then hit the '+' button and add the wireless version setup your computer will find. Should you ever want to revert to a wired setup, you must go through this step again with the printer connected via USB cable.\n\nYour Brother is now set up to print wirelessly and you can put it anywhere you like.\n\nIf Brother would make the setup 'Apple' easy I would give this printer 5 stars. It's a 5-star printer, but a zero-star setup experience.;Very good printer -- a hassle to set up for Mac users
37;64.0;3.0;9.0;913;I like this little printer, a LOT. It's quiet, inexpensive, and it does not rip you off, by way of ink cartridges, like HP printers do. The wireless functionality is superb. My wife routinely prints documents from her notebook, in the kitchen, some sixty feet away from the printer.\n\nMy only nit to pick is this: it is REALLY difficult to properly align pages when you use the manual feed. This is something I do frequently, from letterhead to computer checks. The little alignment guides are just that -- little. They are too short, and many times I have to try, try again to get the sheet properly oriented, by eye. It's harder than it sounds.\n\nThis is such a simple thing, it is difficult to imagine the designers at Brother goofing it up. They did, though.\n\nIf you don't make heavy use of a manual feeder, this printer is hard to beat. If you do, look elsewhere.

42;38.0;1.0;20.0;946;I bought this printer based on the preponderance of high ratings given it.  I liked it, it printed very nicely and with clear, well defined letters.  At about 300 pages I got a Toner warning and thought that it must be a mistake.  I took the cartridge out and shook it to redistribute the toner inside, put it back into the printer and . . . Nada. No printing just the little annoying yellow toner light.  I bought a new toner cartridge thinking that was the problem but, alas, when I inserted the new toner cartridge it still showed the little annoying yellow toner light indicating it needed a new toner cartridge.  I tried reseating the cartridge and many other things along that line but to no avail.  So I have essentially purchased a printer and now a refill toner cartridge for the printer but am receiving no printed pages for my money and my trouble.\n\nI don't know what good this review will do since there are so many good reviews.  Wish I was one of those folks. Even more I wish my printer would just work.  Until now I've always bought Canon printers and for many years have never had the slightest problem with any of them.  I purchased the printer in January and here it is nearly six months later and since I had only recently needed to begin using the printer it's too late to do much of anything except hurl it under a passing truck.  No, just kidding.  Frustration speaking there.\n\nSo, I feel better having vented but still don't have a working printer.

I will update this later.\n\nI do not find this printer noisy as many did and do, but I am coming from an old HP all in one 5500 ink jet which clicks and clacks something fierce. The fan on my unit is not loud but the unit does whine a bit when it is warming up. That said my home office is not quiet, so if this was in a quieter room or I was more sensitive, it might be an issue. It is okay for me however, in any case.\n\nI bought it for the auto duplexing which works well so far. There is a decent curl (see pics in shared images) to the pages though, so if that is going to be an issue look elsewhere.\n\nSo far discounting durability and toner life issues, I would say go for it.

45;107.0;5.0;5.0;970;"The Brother HL-2270DW sure seems to be a good-value (inexpensive, reliable) black and white laser printer, especially if you take advantage of good-quality, new, toner replacement cartridges available from other manufacturers.  However, one of the reasons it is so affordable is because it uses a super-simplistic method of estimating when you need to replace toner cartridges.  Those messages about being low or out of toner often have little or nothing to do with reality.  And this stupid machine will stop printing when it ""thinks"" it has run out of toner.  Sheesh.  It took nearly ten minutes to find workable instructions to reset the machine so that I could exhaust the toner before replacing it.  I don't replace a toner cartrige until my prints begin to look faded.  Keep in mind, I am a para-professional when it comes to computer repair and maintenance and such.  So, anyway, you can do this to reset the toner sensor:\n\n- Leave the machine running.\n- Open the front door cover and leave open while completing the following steps.\n- Turn the printer off.\n- Hold the 'Go' button (or 'Start' button) while turning on the printer.  All panel lights should be on.\n- Release the 'Go' button.\n- Press the 'Go' button two times.\n- Pause.  All lights should be on.\n- Press the 'Go' button five times.\n- The toner light be off.  (Error may be flashing.)  The paper light should be on or flashing.\n- Close cover.  The ready light be the only light on.\n- Turn the printer off.\n- Turn the printer back on.\n\nI recommend using the built-in tool to clean the corona wire on the drum unit as often as you need to reset or change the toner cartridge.  You can sneak this step in at the start of the above process.  Leave the machine ""on"" when you do this:\n\n- Open the front cover and leave the machine for at least 10 minutes to cool down.\n- Take out the drum unit and toner cartridge assembly.\n- Clean the primary corona wire inside the drum unit by gently sliding the green tab from right to left and left to right several times.\n- Put the drum unit and toner cartridge assembly back into the machine. Close the front cover.\n\nAfter cleaning the the corona wire, I would turn the machine off - leave it off for fifteen seconds or so - then turn it back on.\n\nThanks to all the people out there who take the time to write thoughtful reviews on Amazon.\n\nI give this unit five-stars for being cheap and reliable.  Good quality, duplex printing for about $100?!  Wow, that's pretty pretty amazing.  However, I do shloads of printing these days.

48;91.0;1.0;6.0;1019;"I have had many Brother products over the years, which is why I bought this printer.  I had faith in the company.  No more.  This printer stops printing on a regular basis with a variety of error codes, the most annoying being when I am alerted to either low toner or low drum.  Rather than allowing me to continue printing until I become dissatisfied with the quality, the MACHINE decides and way before the toner or the drum needs changing.  I know because I found a way around it and printed 1000 more pages before I actually needed a new toner.  However, I replaced a toner about two weeks ago and again, the printer will not print.  After ""the workaround"", I had a NEW error message - no paper.  Wrong - there is plenty of paper.  All in all, this printer requires a lot of attention and I had to buy a new printer (NOT a Brother) as a backup since I consider this printer utterly unreliable.  I will NEVER buy another Brother product.  They were great.  No longer.";One of the WORST printers I have ever used.
49;24.0;4.0;37.0;1074;"I just bought this printer for my dorm, because I've realized that this semester, I'll need to do a lot of printing... and walking to the library for $.10/side printouts was getting old. If the marketing material is to be believed, the printer itself, which comes with enough toner for 700 pages, is worth about 13 cents per page at the $90 I bought it for! Subsequently, with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/45-currently-2600-page-toner-cartridge/dp/B003YFHCKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">$45 (currently), 2600-page toner cartridge</a>, printouts will be under 2 cents a page.\n\nThings I like:\n- It's small. Granted, it does take up a lot of room on my desk, but with their trays extended, most inkjet printers probably have around the same footprint. I'll soon have another place to put it, where hopefully it'll get in the way a little less.\n- It has a nice, minimalist look.\n- It's fast. In duplex mode, at 10 sides per minute, it'll beat most inkjet printers, even when they're set to single-sided printing. In single-sided mode, at 27 ppm, it's no contest.\n- Being able to print double-sided automatically is fantastic. Even though paper is cheap (a fraction of the cost of toner), it still seems like a waste to print single-sided, and having less paper to carry around is nice.\n- Though this is an advantage to laser printers in general, text comes out sharp, never runs or bleeds even if the page gets wet, and when printing double-sided, even on thin paper, toner will never bleed through to the other side of the paper.\n- I can't use the device's networking capability on campus, but the ability to share the printer on a network without using a computer as a print server is very valuable functionality where one can use it. Even if it's only going to be used with one computer, and that computer is always right next to the printer, it's always nice to have one fewer cable cluttering things.\n\nThings that bother me:\n- At its default resolution of 600DPI, some thin horizontal lines on certain fonts don't come through. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my unit, but it can be annoying.\n- The user interface is terrible. I understand it's a low-cost printer... but I'm sure they could afford to throw in a few more buttons. It has only one button, which is used for all functionality, through things like holding it for some period of time, repeatedly pressing it some number of times, or turning the printer on while holding it.\n- Related to the above: Canceling a print job requires holding down the button for four seconds. By this time, two pages will have already printed! Seriously, even if the device only has one button, could they not have it cancel the job immediately? I can't imagine any other functionality the button might be needed for during a print job. More egregiously, I've never actually had it successfully cancel a print job... the lights indicate it's canceling, but the remaining pages of the job still come out. The only way to stop it is cutting the power, which results in a messy jam that has to be manually cleared, not to mention most likely being pretty bad for the printer.\n- The manual feed is near useless. About half the time, no matter how carefully I've tried, it'll pull the paper in one corner first. It's never resulted in a jam, but the printout comes out massively skewed.\n- Others have complained about the noise from the fan. It definitely seems like there's no reason for it to run, even at low speed, for so long after it's finished printing. But I'd like to note an additional complaint: After the fan has stopped, there is a slight high-pitched electronic whine. It's hardly noticeable if there's any background noise, but when it's right there on the desk, I can hear it. Perhaps in a few years when I lose some of my hearing range, it won't bother me, but as it is, I generally turn it off.\n- The power usage is rated at 65W when ""ready"" and 500W or so when printing. What they really mean by this is that, when ""ready,"" it may in fact draw 65W on average, but what it is actually doing is, every so often, momentarily drawing something between 500W and 900W. This is something I feel they should specify. Especially in a dorm room, where a microwave, fridge, and printer might all be on the same circuit, blowing a fuse or tripping a breaker is a real possibility. When printing, the power draw varies, but often exceeds the average value of 500W. By the way -- the only advantage to having it stay awake for longer is that you'll save 10 or so seconds waiting for it to warm up before the first page comes out. Definitely not worth the 65W power consumption -- that's like leaving an incandescent light on. I have mine set to go to sleep after a minute of activity. This is probably appropriate for most users.";Good printer with some annoying quirks
50;51.0;5.0;13.0;1077;"SETUP\nNetwork and driver setup is a breeze. There's more than one way to do the first time configuration: via a temporary USB or Ethernet cable connection. Then I used the setup tool on 64-bit Windows 7 Home, and it cleverly discovers your network's SSID and wireless password from the setup host computer.\n\nI setup my Ubuntu 64-bit Linux with this printer, just went to Printers, ""Add"", Network Printer and wait a few seconds and it was discovered on the network. There was no Brother HL-2270DW driver included with my OS. Apparently you can get the correct Linux driver on the Brother site, but Brother does not support 64-bit Linux. Don't even worry about this... just pick any Brother driver which is ""close"" to 2270DW and it will work. If you want to use Duplex printing, make sure the driver you pick supports that feature.\n\nQUALITY\nThe print quality is outstanding for 600dpi, and toner coverage is a solid 100%.  The toner cartridges seem expensive, but relative to my short lived inkjet printers it is a bargain. 3rd party toner carts do exist, though it looks like you have to fiddle with things to use them (I have not tested 3rd party toner). Did I say this printer was FAST?\n\nMost people won't care about this usage: I used this to print out text, source code, line art and dithered /halftone art. No issues. I used this to print some PCB (printed circuit board) artwork onto manually-fed glossy transfer paper (actually cut out from a magazine), then used a clothes iron to transfer the artwork from the printed page to copper clad protoboard, and then etched the copperboard in acid. The toner survived the ""etching"" process, and once cleaned off I had a nice metal etched board. I'm stating this because I read at least 1 review that the toner in this printer was not durable enough to act as an acid resist. The toner is great. I'm sure at least one in a two hundred users would be wondering if this is good for PCB artwork.\n\nNOISE\nA word of caution, the cooling fan on this printer is a little noisy. When sleeping, the printer is totally silent. After you print a page it takes maybe 5 minutes for the printer to return to sleep.. if I were to try printing something at 3AM I am almost sure that the fan wake someone up, and the 5 minute cool down would seem interminable. I just won't print something that late. :)\n\nDuplex and wireless and good driver support and under $100. It's not color, but color lasers are 400-500% more money. My inkjet printers would constantly and hopelessly clog (even the black ink) so that whenever I needed to print, it was a hassle. So far this printer is nice relief from that stress. This printer meets and exceeds all my expectations so 5 stars it is.";Great resolution, FAST, wireless is easy setup, Works with Ubuntu Linux
51;95.0;2.0;6.0;1078;I bought this printer a few weeks ago. Set up was pretty easy. But the print cycle is amazingly long, and amazingly loud. You print a single page, and the machine remains powered up at that same level of noise for a minimum of 10 minutes. I can't imagine any home office that would want to put up with this. I called tech support and they confirmed it, and said that the machine will sometimes power up on its own during the day, and for that same amount of time. I was sorry to have to return it. Perfectly fine in every other way.;Too loud for too long - returned

But as soon as it goes to sleep, it vanishes from the network.\n\nI work in IT, and normally have no trouble configuring and debugging wireless connections; this problem is in the printer itself.\n\nAnd, unfortunately I bought it through a 3rd party seller (ebestpurchase) so my chances of getting an easy replacement are nil, and I'd probably have to pay all the shipping anyway. Lesson learned the hard way.";Won't stay online.  Power-off/on every time I print
53;109.0;2.0;5.0;1085;I purchased this Brother HL-2270DW printer because of the good performance reviews.  The print quality is good, the machine is efficient, and duplex printing is a snap.  But, finding functional replacement cartridges is a very difficult proposition.  I've tried nearly all of the units offered here on Amazon, and it is a real hit-or-miss proposition.  Some work, some don't, mostly it's just a pain to find one that actually functions in this unit.  I hate to spend $45 on the OEM replacement cartridge, but I'm at about the 33% rate on the non-Brother replacement functionality, irrespective of brand.;If only I could find functional replacement cartridges somewhere
54;110.0;5.0;5.0;1086;"I have been using the Brother HL-2270DW printer for a few days.  I am very happy with it.\n\nThe packaging was easy to open and I was able to remove the printer from the box by myself.  In the past, it has been a two-person job, one to hold the box and one to lift the printer out.\n\nThe set-up was easy and took only a few minutes.  The instructions are clear and well written.  Drawings are included and accurate.  The on-screen set-up is one of the best I have seen.  Brother has done an excellent job creating the set-up instructions.  Using this as wireless or with a cable has been trouble-free.\n\nThe ability to duplex easily couldn't be any better.  It is easy to switch back and forth when necessary.  Any changes needed to be made in the printer settings are very easy to do because Brother has made it easy to get to the right place and the screens are well-organized.\n\nI read reviews on Amazon and other websites before buying this printer, and two things were brought up many times: noise and paper curl.\n\nThe noise this printer makes is not an issue to me.  The noise is different from other printers I have used, but I don't think it is any worse than any other printer.\n\nPaper curl is more about the paper than it is about the printer.  Yes, the printer does affect curl, but some types of paper will curl more than others.  I worked in the printing industry for many, many years and some types of paper were never a problem and other types of paper were nightmares.\n\nI am still using the starter toner cartridge that came with the printer.  The prints are clean and crisp.  After I use the regular cartridge I bought with the printer, I will review it.  I did note in some reviews complaints about having to change the drum and cleaning the corona wire; these are parts of printers (whether a printer, fax, copier) that wear and get dirty, and they need to be replaced and/or cleaned from time to time.\n\nI have looked at the user manual and troubleshooting guide.  Both of these are very useful.  The manual is well-organized and well-written.  The troubleshooting guide is clear and easy to use.\n\nMy decision to buy this printer was made partly because of the reviews and partly because of price.  The price for this printer is about $30-$40 less on Amazon than it is in the stores in my area.  Also, the toner cartridges are almost $20 less on Amazon.  I also compared the cost of other toner cartridges for other printers I was considering and the cartridges for this printer are slightly less per page than others.  On a per page basis, it doesn't make much difference; however, long-term it will add up considerably.\n\nI would recommend the Brother HL-2270DW to anyone needing a good, but relatively inexpensive, laser printer.\n\nUPDATE 06/12/2012:  I finally replaced the ""starter"" toner cartridge that came with the printer.  I do not print a lot, but I do print everyday.  The starter cartridge lasted about 5-1/2 months for me.  I find that impressive!  Replacing the cartridge was simple and the new cartridge, which I ordered when I ordered the printer, is working fine.  This is another reason to recommend this printer.";Good Printer, Great Price!
55;39.0;2.0;21.0;1101;In addition to concerns about the heavier-than advertised use of toner, beware of two things. First, the printer is quite loud. Often, after printing, it will make a fan-noise for some time before going silent. If the printer is near you in your workspace, it can be as annoying as a loud fluorescent bulb. Secondly, the manual paper feed is abysmal: on over 80% of sheets fed the printer pulls the paper crookedly, resulting in a folded edge and angled printing. If only I had realized while I could still return the unit! Buyer, beware.;Adequate, but with drawbacks
56;36.0;5.0;25.0;1112;"You're probably an ink jet person. Maybe you're here because you're fed up with buying ink refills that only ever seem to print out five pages before coming up ""empty."" Or maybe you're sick of how much of a racket certain printer companies are. Selling you printers that are cheaper than the ink refills they require? Yep. I was like you once.\n\nI'm not proud of the things I've done. I threatened my printer with a baseball bat. I hung it out a window, dangling by its cord after it taunted my by printing an advertisement for ITSELF when all I wanted it to do was print out a page of my choosing. Maybe you know what I mean. Maybe you too have screamed at a printer because it kept telling you its Cyan levels were low, even though you only wanted to print black and white.\n\nBut those days are over.\n\nI didn't like the kind of person I was becoming. I took a chance. I bought a Brother printer. I thought, maybe laser printers are a better way to go. Since Brother offers this printer at such a reasonable price, I figured if it worked out, it was worth the investment. It turns out I was right. No longer do I go to sleep with bloodied fists, broken and cut from fighting ink jet printers. No more will the sound of mechanical screams haunt my nightmares.\n\nToday is a new day. I wake up. Sometimes I print, sometimes I don't print. But it's always on MY terms. I got a high yield toner cartridge to replace the one that comes with the printer. It's been over a year, and I still haven't had to change it. It isn't even telling me I'm low on ink. I'm writing a book. I print out hundreds of pages of text. Oh, another thing that's amazing about this printer? Auto duplexing. That's right, I said it.\n\nSo go ahead. Take a chance.

Please confirm that each time I want to print an envelope I must start with a new document and print each envelope as a separate job.\n4:59 PM Yvonne: More then likely yes. If you already have the envelopes created within your application just open them up and print them from there.

(I did not receive an error message when with occurred, instead my printer simply stopped printing and the LED toner light was solid yellow) You have two options: 1) replace the cartridge ($$$) or 2) go into the printer setting options and override this. I found this (option 2) a little hard to do as these settings are separate from the ""Printing Preferences"" accessed via the Control Panel's Devices and Printers page. So, I'm listing the method below (Windows 7, on a home network). Essentially, you need to access the printer's homepage on the local area network.\n\n1.) Windows Start button, search ""Network"" OR simply type ""Network"" into any folder address bar. Click on the ""Network"" icon from your search and open. This should enable you to access the control page of your network.

Type this into your address bar.)\n\n2.) All the devices on your network should appear in a new window. Open your ""Brother HL-2270DW series"" icon. This should allow you to view the device webpage.\n\n3.) Select ""Printer Settings"" (Green Key), scroll to the bottom, find ""Replace Toner"" and select ""Continue"" then select ""Submit"".\n\n4.)

59;111.0;1.0;5.0;1149;Now that I have had my Brother printer for about 8 months, I can say that there one major positive, but does the major negative outway the positive.  The positive is that Brother will help you set up and pin point problems over the phone w/o charge.  BUT the printer tells you that the ink catridge needs to be replaced and forces you to replace it while the toner is still dark.  Brother and other printer companies make their money from the toner.  It is unethical to not allow you to use all the toner before replacing the catridge.\n\nHeads UP!;Positives and NEGATIVES
60;87.0;4.0;7.0;1154;"The printer does a solid job of making prints.  It compares favorably to the prints made by my Samsung ML-1210 which gave me many good years before it gave up the ghost with a death-throw 15 page paper jam.\n\nA couple of things that you should be aware of this Brotha.  The wireless setup is more difficult than you will anticipate if you have no experience with networking.  If the SSID isn't showing b/c you setup your router to not advertise the SSID, manually inputting it into the setup settings won't work.  You'll have to FIRST go into the router settings, turn on the advertise SSID, then the printer's networking setup software will link up with it.  Once associated, then you can go back into your router settings and turn off the SSID advertisement. The printer will still be linked.\n\nIf you're still frazzled, calling their tech support should help.  They pickup the call right quick and give you competent understandable English advice--refreshing in this day and age.  You'll need to get the contact # from their website (they make you work for it) as the number isn't printed in their ""could be better"" How-To manual included in the box.\n\nBe sure to get the LATEST drivers/firmware and software from their website.  While the included disc is fairly updated new, they have more updated drivers on the web (such as fixing issues like duplex printing alignment). This is especially important if you're setting up wireless with a Mac as they have various semi-older drivers.  Once you add the Mac driver, *RESTART* your computer.  The driver doesn't work until you REBOOT, otherwise you'll be scratching your head and calling tech support (who are already VERY familiar with this issue).  A simple reboot note in the software setup or manual would save loads of time here.\n\nIn terms of functionality, ideally I like to use duplex printing and low toner to save paper and ink.  Unfortunately, there are quibbles.  When you turn on the duplex function in the printer settings in the Operating System, it does funky things.  Even if you print ONE page, the machine will flip the paper over for no reason!  So EACH single print takes longer to get out of the machine due to the unnecessary flipping.  Thus, I keep the duplex function OFF to save time since most of my prints are single page anyways.  When I'm doing several pages, I'll manually go into the print settings to do a one time duplex print for that particular documents.  As of November 2011, they still haven't fixed this minor issue with the drivers, so I doubt it'll ever get done as this issue is a BLATANT one.\n\n""Toner save"" print seems to work and the print quality is very good and is practically indistinguishable from full-on print.  You wonder if it's even turned on as the print comparison looks equal in quality.\n\nOther good things about the printer is that the tray is deep so you can put a big ream of paper in the machine with no issues.\n\nAlso, beware of the green ""GO"" button!  It has MANY functions (depending on the # of presses) that are NOT easy to memorize so I'd indeed write them down on a piece of paper and tape it to the computer: such as wireless status report, printer status report, wireless reboot, toner reboot (to get the most ink out of the greedy programmed cartridge!) and so forth.  Otherwise, you'll need to download the meaty/large PDF manual (listing all of the machine's....shhhhh....""secrets"") from their website as the setup guide in the box is bare-bones in comparison.\n\nBe aware that the box doesn't include a USB cable, so you'll need to buy one if you plan to link it up to a desktop computer.  YES, you can set the wireless up with the desktop computer, but prints DO take longer to print than with the USB or ethernet cable.  The cable is MUCH faster!!  Wireless is only for the laptops at home, not desktop.  BTW, get the long USB cables on Ebay to save money.\n\nIn terms of using the Sleep mode, it does take a long time to enter into it even when playing with the settings which don't seem subjectively to do that much.  Until it hits SLEEP mode, you'll hear the engine annoyingly loud for a good amount of time with it's side fan spewing warm smelly air onto your wrist.  In other words, it's better to turn it OFF when not in use, instead of relying on the sluggish Sleep mode which takes far too long to go into this state, not to mention wasting needless energy in this state.\n\nAll-in-all, I think most would be pleased.  Especially for home use.  It does have its annoying quirks but nothing deal-breaking.  It's almost 5 star but the firmware functionality annoyances knock off a star.\n\nBTW....buy the Brother high yield toner as you'll get MUCH more value than the smaller cartridge.  You'll save money in the end.  Buy it here on Amazon as the price is the best found (aside of looking for iffy refilled cartridges on Ebay, etc).";Solid Printer...but with Minor Quibbles

No need to complain about LCD and pressing the 'Go' button 7 times.\nUse the device's web page and all settings; status; error logs are easily available. It's fantastic software for a printer for this price. Its all documented if you bother to read a little. My Kodak sucked .. absolutely horrible inflexible software by comparison.\nGo to [...]\n\nAll settings are there. If you need to login, id is 'admin', password is 'access'.\nSet replace toner = continue on the printer settings screen. Also set 'toner=save' and sleep time and many other things. Stop futzing with the 'Go' button. I've hs the printer 4 months and never touched it. I assume there is an equivalent for USB. Also install BRAdmin professional and its got all this stuff and more. Click the Device Home page.\nAnd appreciate the software and functions Brother provided. My starter toner is displaying 'Low toner' after 490 pages and many are more than 5%. Toner shows 40% used and I simply set toner replace = continue. No more messages, no more error lights.\n\nI recommend Fineprint to all who print [...]. Saves more paper and toner, lets you choose double or single sided; remove graphics if you don't need them to save much more ink when printing airline confirmations; web pages etc. and allows you to set different profiles for the laser such as 300DPI toner save; 600dpi graphics no toner save etc. Lets you preview prints; delete pages from a print before printing so you don't print unneeded pages. Lets you specify number of copies; can reprint; etc. Makes the experience just fantastic.\nOne trick it allows is fairly easy printing of some double sided and some single pages in one print e.g. a tax return. You delete the single sided pages; print; undelete; delete double sided pages and print again. So easy.\nI think it costs $50. I have had it for years and saved that many times over in ink; paper and convenience. It has a trial. Also allows you to create multiple printers. So if you have an inkjet, just click 'Color' or 'B&W' when you choose your printer and you don't have to set anything else. Their support is also great. Makes the experience just fantastic.\nI have no ties to them .. just a satisfied user with my inkjet for color and Brother for B&W. Works great.\nThe Brother was very easy to set up wireless. Has never jammed. Prints duplex fast and with no issues. I use #24 paper from Costco. 800 sheets cost $6-99 so don't skimp by using #20 paper. I get no noticeable curl with this paper.\nBought a 420 cartridge from Newegg on special for $28. My Canon color inkjet cartridge costs more than that!\n\nPlease don't post any more about extending toner life!!";Toner Low Error - Fix
62;112.0;5.0;5.0;1201;"Like many people, I don't use my printer daily and I was getting sick and tired of clogged print heads every time I went to use it.  HP ink cartridges are not only EXTREMELY expensive (and the cheap knock-offs totally suck), but I think they're actually designed to clog, or at least deliberately not designed not to.\n\nSo I purchased this printer, and did have some issues connecting it to my AT&T U-Verse 2Wire wireless gateway, but the problem was because I had changed the settings to only use 802.11g, and I never bothered to notice that this requires 802.11b, so needless to say it wasn't connecting.  Once I set my modem to ""auto"" it immediately worked (note:  I'm using OS X Lion with a Mac).\n\nThis thing is a workhorse and can handle huge print jobs, but occasional printing is where it really excels.  It holds an advantage over inkjets in just about every category.  First of all, it uses less than 1 watt of electricity in sleep mode (my previous HP used almost 11, probably because the screen stayed backlit all the time), and makes zero noise.  I would estimate that I was wasting 75% of my HP ink on cleaning the printer heads when I rarely used it, so to be able to now print every page that is estimated is HUGE.\n\nI bought this when it was $90 on Amazon, but missed all three delivery attempts so it was returned.  I ended up walking down the road to an electronics store and paying $120, and it's still worth every penny.  You won't find a wireless printer with double-sided printing capability AND a manual feed option anywhere near this price.  On top of that, replacement toner won't break the bank.\n\nI would recommend this printer to any/everyone who wants a reliable printer without having to go to Staples and replace a cartridge every other time they need to print something.  I haven't owned a Brother printer since dot-matrix was the norm in the early 90's, but I'm officially a huge fan again.  Also, it doesn't load paper from a slot that sticks straight up in the back, and it doesn't feed printed paper to a folding tray sticking out the front (both are inkjet standards), so while it's larger than an inkjet, it's actually much less obtrusive.  It has a hidden drawer for paper, a manual-feed slot cleverly hidden under the ""BROTHER"" name on the front, and feeds paper out of the top onto itself.  That's awesome.\n\nBottom line: Get this, you won't regret it.";HP Should Be Terrified of This Printer

It's impossible to reach over the network. The only way to bring it back online is to power it off, then back on. I tried assigning it a static IP and several other tricks. Both wired and wireless. Same result. The green ""go"" button won't even wake it.\n\nThe print quality, speed, and cost is great.

64;26.0;1.0;33.0;1206;"We purchase many printers and recently purchased the 2270 and were surprised that it wasn't as good as our previous Brother printers.  The duplex mode works for 3-4 pages and then jams.  Second one of the roller assemblies had a piece just ""fall off"" during printing and because of how the printer is assembled it's impossible for anyone but a repair shop to re-insert this small piece.  Given the low initial price and now the time to get it repaired we'll likely toss the printer and switch brands.";Poor duplexer, poor build quality
65;113.0;4.0;5.0;1211;I read the negative reviews on this printer very carefully. But there were so many, many positive reviews that I purchased it anyway with the full knowledge that I could return it to Staples within 14 days if it gave me any problems.\n\nOther reviewers have covered the pros at length, so I'll just stick with my initial concerns.\n\n1) Was able to set up the wireless function via USB on the second try. The first try seemed to go smoothly, but then nothing would print. Turned out I had two set-ups for some unknown reason. Went to an earlier restore point, tried again, and it works like a charm. (I'm only reasonably intelligent, but could follow the manual and on screen instructions fairly easily.)\n\n2) It is noisy. One reviewer said it sounded like a jet airplane taking off and it sorta does... a very small one. But hey, it's wireless! I don't have to sit next to it.\n\n3) My third concern was the toner cartridges printing far fewer pages than claimed. It's too early to tell, but it sure can't be more expensive than the ink jet printer it is replacing. Will update this review if it turns out to be a problem.;So far, so good...
66;101.0;1.0;6.0;1215;I bought the machine because of the fantastic review. However, I have been fixing the paper jam all the time in the past one month. Think twice before you make the purchase. This is my first time writing review, so you can tell how angry I am about the machine.;Don't buy it

I never thought it possible - nay, the concept had remained unimaginable to me - that a young college student of my means could enter the world of duplex laser printing. Sure, maybe someday when I have a real job and a real car and a real wife and I'm living the American dream, but those are theoretical points in the future that the college industrial complex has constructed for me to justify my sinking into debt and working a full time job while taking a double load of classes. I never thought those times would actually come, and I definitely didn't see it anytime soon.\n\nThe amazing thing about capitalism is, though, if you can't make it to P* on the supply curve, the supply curve will eventually make it to you.\n\nBrother has produced, for the poor wretched masses of this world, a printer which will print a piece of paper, PAUSE, suck that paper BACK IN, and THEN print the other side. It's literally more amazing than the pyramids, more beautiful than the cover of The Cars' Candy-O album (I guess?), and when you have to print out a packet of notes that is 24 pages long, you come to class a lighter and richer man.\n\nWhile I only have had my life changed by the wireless-duplexing magic of the 2270DW for a few months now, I have had an older work of Brother's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-HL-2140-Personal-Laser-Printer/dp/B0010Z1W06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother HL-2140 Personal Laser Printer</a>) for several years and have been incredibly supportive of the company's effort to bring me cheap, reliable, unjammable printing products.

68;102.0;3.0;6.0;1227;I was impressed with the reviews for this printer, but for me, I think the other reviews missed a few things that should be considered:\n\n1)  No USB/Networking Cables:  If you plan on hooking up this printer, you need to have the cables as all this comes with is a power cord. Fortunately, I had an old USB cable to use but I would be upset if not.\n\n2)  Noise Factor:  When compared with my Dell laser printer which would shut down after printing a page, this printer runs loud continuously after your turn it on and print something. If printer noise doesn't bother you, this is not an issue, but for me it is.\n\n3)  Power Draw:  When printing a page, the lights in my office dim as if the printer is causing an intense power draw. My older laser printer, which is supposedly less energy efficient (not Energy Star) did not do this so I suspect that this printer is going to cost you more in energy over the long-term in comparison with other products.\n\nOverall, I think the printer is still a good choice, but these three negatives should be considered especially if you are as picky as I am about these things.;A Few Negatives

I went to the Windows 7 Network and Sharing Center, clicked on my network name then double-clicked on the Brother printer.  Windows 7 installed the drivers.  I was then able to use the printer.  3.

In early 2011 I installed my first home wireless 802.11n network and on a lark I decided to research laser printers. I was surprised to find that several budget models with wi-fi capability were actually very reasonable and quite within my price range ($100-150).\n\nAt the time of my comparison, 3 serious contenders stood out.

They were all very similar so after reading review after negative review (I usually start with the 1 star ratings and work my way up), I took a leap of faith and selected the Brother - due, it seems, that it was the lesser of 3 evils. Though I didn't end up purchasing from Amazon, I am very happy that I received the printer and starter toner/drum assembly for under a hundred and ten bucks.\n\nAs an advanced User, I didn't think the installation would be anything more than I could handle - and it pretty much went as smoothly as expected. I knew what to expect and I was well prepared for common setup problems due to the reviews I had read prior to ordering. The printer was up and running on 802.11g wi-fi (mixed WinXP/Win7/Android network) in less than half a day's work. Oh, and that includes downloading the newest drivers and even the upgrading the device to the most recent firmware for the print and network hardware.\n\nI followed advice from several savvy reviewers which bears repeating, so if you haven't installed yet or are having trouble your best bet is to run the setup program with the device hard-wired through ethernet (to your gateway or router) rather than USB. Also, you are advised to configure the printer with a static IP address. It's easier than it sounds, just have the printer use an IP address outside of your normal DHCP range (e.g. someone with a dynamic range of 192.168.0.100 through 192.168.0.150 might set their printer to use 192.168.0.69). This is all configured through Brother's setup program, you should not actually have to login to your router unless you do not have DHCP service (in which case you should probably contact your Network Administrator). Finally, or more importantly firstly, you should visit Brother's website and download the latest software drivers... and if you feel competent, the firmware drivers and instructions. If you installed your own network, this should be cake and pie.\n\nIf you are a confident User and you are in the market for a casual laser printer, you should be very happy with this purchase. The wi-fi capability for me was a requirement, but the auto-duplex feature is definitely a nice bonus over the manual duplexing currently found in other models of this class. I can't speak to the cost per page or ability to print large volumes of paper; but for a low cost wireless laser with crisp text, large paper capacity, and multiple toner replacement options - the Brother HL2270DW absolutely ranks at the top.\n\nA more intuitive error reporting system (such as a display on the printer) might be the only improvement. LCDs are cheap and seem to be put on everything these days... it's almost anachronistic to diagnose common printer issues using columns of analog LEDs on an otherwise advanced 21st century device.";If the horror stories don't scare you away, this is definitely a printer to consider

75;25.0;3.0;41.0;1335;"The first few days, I loved this little machine. I purchased it to print some digital homeschool curriculum for my children. I figured it would be more cost effective to buy digital rights and this printer, than to buy hardcopies of materials for 4 kids. But after printing around 300 pages, I got the low toner light. Everything I printed was on ""toner save mode"" and 300dpi since these aren't important business documents. But that was less than 50% of the life expectancy (700 pages) of the starter toner. A phone call to Brother assured me that it was normal for the light to come on around the 50% mark to warn you to purchase new toner and not be stranded when it finally runs out. But then at 540 pages (and before my new cartridge arrived!) the ""replace toner"" signal came on and it wouldn't print anymore. That was less than 80% of the average toner page count. I called Brother again and was told that the page counts for the toners are computed on only 5% page coverage, or around 160 words per page. While I wasn't printing graphics and was printing my text heavy documents at the most conservative settings, my pages had higher than 5% coverage and significantly decreased my expected performance. Even getting only 75-80% of the average page count out of the toner and drum, I think this will still end up being a bargain for me in the long run. But it won't be AS good a deal as I thought it would. I didn't figure out until after the fact that my printing needs are more taxing than ""average"".

78;9.0;1.0;122.0;1350;I have nothing but good things to say about this printer accept that it can't seem to handle printing anything of any length without stopping and restarting the project. For example,  I needed to print a 30 page chapter to review and it printed all but the first 6 pages, stopped for about 30 seconds, spit out a half printed page, and then proceeded to start all over again as if it had not printed anything yet.  No error, nothing, just restart a big job.  This happens a lot - too much that I now resort to sit and watch the printer so that I don't get twice as much as I hoped for. My only recourse is to stop the print job from the computer and restart it with only the pages I need left.  This is very annoying, enough that I'm considering returning it.  If there is anyone out there with some ideas about what to do about this, I'd be happy to change my review to a 5 star.  Honestly, the printer is fast and easy to install, the duplex works flawlessly.

I had to print more than 2000 pdf pages study material and printing at any of the office stores would have cost me way more than buying this printer.\n1) The cartridge original to the printer gave me around a 1000 pages.\n2) Then I turned to tonerrefillkits online store to buy the toner refills. I got 2 refills for $27(incl. shipping). The refill process was little messy so you have to choose between great savings and a little inconvenience. The difficult part with the refill was resetting the toner gears since the starter cartridge is missing a reset gear. I did it moving the gears manually looking at their alignment in the pictures in the toner refill instructions. I must not have done that accurately because since then my toner light is always lit. But the printer prints just fine.\n  Many thanks to the reviewers who mentioned that one could go online to the printer's ip address and select continue, to print more when one gets the toner error! I am on Windows 7 and had a some difficulty finding the printer ip address. Here is how I found it eventually: Open Control panel, click 'Devices and printers'. Select your printer and on the top, just below the address bar, click 'Printer server properties'. Select 'port' tab on the pop that appears. Scroll down to find your printer. The text in the column port is your printer's ip address.\n  Now my print count is 2508 pages!!! Could not be happier with the purchase. So choose this printer for a big print job and afterwards you will find it convenient to have printer at home when you have to print those coupons :);Excellent value for money
82;40.0;5.0;22.0;1369;I'm going to do a quick review of my last Epson for comparison.  It was mac compatible.  It could do network printing.  It could do bluetooth printing with an $80 adapter (a non-epson $10 adapter worked).  What they didn't tell me was that it didn't do network printing with a mac even with another computer set up as a server, and that bluetooth printing would only work with .pdf and .jpg files.\n\nBy contrast, this Brother printer is actually mac compatible.  It can do USB, ethernet, and wifi.  They all actually work with a mac.  Duplex printing is fully functional with a mac.  The installation disc was really easy to use on macs and PC's.  In standby mode the printer uses less than 1 watt of power, according to my kill-a-watt.  I just hit print on my laptop and this printer wakes up and starts printing within 30 seconds.  This printer impressed me so much that I've been trying to get all my friends to buy the same one... and now I'm trying to get random strangers on amazon to buy one too :p;Great for networking with a mac.
83;105.0;1.0;6.0;1382;Great printer, installs easily, until you find out that the toner cartridge that comes with it only prints 700 pages!

(i own 4 now) and I will slam their cheating tactics everywhere I can!!!!!;ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
84;106.0;2.0;6.0;1390;"The printer is good, if a bit loud. It works as promised, with easy set-up and good speed. This printer, however, is designed to make you send back perfectly good toner when you buy a new cartridge. Some printers continue to print when the toner is low. This one does not. That is not so bad, but there is not an override option. So, when it decides you are out of toner, that is it.\n\nOn previous Brother printers there was a hack to fool the printer. It involved putting electrical tape over an optical sensor. Those who did this said they got another 1000 pages from the cartridge. Of course, longer cartridge life does not make Brother any money, so this model was designed to prevent that hack. There is no optical sensor. There is a toner flag that you will have to reset.\n\nThis printer was designed to make you waste toner, Brother figuring that it can sell the printer itself for cheap so long as they make up the difference in frequent replacement cartridge sales. No one will buy a low-volume cartridge, so Brother designed the cartridges so that you cannot use all of them; they get to claim that they give you a lot of toner, and you buy cartridges as though they had not. This printer's design was dictated by Brother's desire to prevent a work-around that people had discovered for previous models. So, if you buy this printer, know that you will have to hack the printer cartridge to get the toner that you pay for. It is a different hack from previous models, this one increasing the chances that you will spill toner on yourself.\n\nOf course, there is no flag to set on your starter-cartridge, so there is no way to hack that. When they say it is half full, know that you will only be able to use about half of that half-cartridge.";Printer is good, but be prepared to hack your printer
85;71.0;2.0;10.0;1390;"If you're thinking of using this printer as your primary ""always on"" printer, FORGET IT. Even though it has a sleep mode, its high-frequency noise before it sleeps will be one of your loudest computer devices in the house. You can set the sleep mode to one minute, but this was the longest one minute I've had to endure. The printer is in a non-computer room and just use the On/Off switch to turn it off if it becomes too much of a bother. This isn't particularly inconvenient, since we have inkjet scanner/copiers near most of the computers for regular small-print use, but I hope this won't shorten the device's life. The laser jet is only used as ""batch job"" printer for all the computers we have around the house, so its wireless and auto-duplex features are a must. Compared to other budget laser printers with these features, the toner cartridge costs are less expensive. I wished I had more time to wait for a *quiet* laser printer on sale, but compared to inkjet refills, this was a good enough choice. As for installation, we have several Win XP and Windows 7 computers. I downloaded the updated drivers and software from the Brother site (updated 12/10/10 as of this review), and didn't have any problems.\n\nUPDATE: Five months later, the drum accumulated a ""blotch"" of toner. This is outside of the warranty period, and a third-party replacement costs about half the price of the original printer. A Brother drum costs the SAME price as the original. You can clean a laser drum with alcohol or acetone, but no guarantees.";Noisy -- and drum died after warranty period

87;78.0;5.0;9.0;1406;I have never had any laser printer before and this is a my very first laser printer and I'm happy that I have bought this brand and model. There are reviews about bad wireless connection and too difficult to set up, oh well, those always come from people who do not read the instructions correctly or have limited computer knowledge skill (I'm sorry if I have offended any.) The package was very well packed and prepared. The printer built quality is solid with nice executed designs and buttons. The duplexer works like a dream. As soon as I have finished setting it up, I immediately print 45 double pages with ease, it takes a little bit longer than I expect though. if your primarily printing is black and white, this laser printer is for you. You just click buy it now and you will be a very happy person. The operation cost per page is very low, I bought the extra toner from Brothers and still I didn't have to use it yet after 1 month of moderate printing.;Very good printer!

91;93.0;5.0;7.0;1419;I got this printer when it was on sale by Amazon for $90.  It was pretty much a steal then, now the price has gone up to $130.  However, I did a lot of research and even now at the current price, not many printers at this price range were great value AND had a duplexer.  Setting it up was dead easy, like everyone else says, it was simply popping in the disk for each of the machines and installing drivers.  The first time you set up a machine, you have to connect the printer through USB, Ethernet, or WiFi (though this option may not work for some people).  Anyway, it's a great printer, shoots out pages unbelievably fast.  I was debating whether to get the $180 Brother printer that also had a duplexer and slightly faster speeds, but I feel like I've gotten my money's worth already and didn't need to spend the additional cash to save a few seconds each time I print.\n\nSo, in summary: it's an amazing printer, that has amazing Mac, Windows, and Linux support (I assume you can install drivers for Linux too because its drivers are based on CUPS).  I'm so amazed at how well it performs, all the other laser printers I've had had some sort of drawback to them.  This one doesn't, considering its price range.  Sure, you can get a better quality image from a higher-end model, but do you really need to see every detail in monochrome?  And yes, you can get a better speed from a higher-end printer, but this one seems plenty fast enough for most people.\n\nThe only serious issue is when you first use it, it emitted a strong plastic smell (this will eventually wear off), so you want to be in a well-ventilated room before you use it for the first time (I can only assume that it's degassing because of brand new parts).  I can even live with the noise it makes, which is passable... about as loud as a hair dryer next to you, because it's not as annoying as some laser printers I've had (HP, I'm looking at you).;Great printer for the price.
92;94.0;1.0;7.0;1422;First, it was impossible to install to work wirelessly in our home without a central computer hooked up to the wireless router, as far as I could tell.  The instructions hinted at a particular type of router that might manage that, but that's not an option.\n\nSecond, we decided to give up on the wireless functionality and just plug in for print jobs - fine.  Great, until it broke after three days and no more than five print jobs through it.  Motor no longer feeds paper, just sits there making noise.  No workie.  It's going back!  Junk!;"Impossible installation instructions; then it broke"
93;84.0;5.0;8.0;1431;"I just purchased this printer and it's absolutely awesome! Unlike the other reviewers here, I had absolutely no problem setting this printer up. My router doesn't have the WPS function, but it was still easy to setup using a USB cord. All I had to was download the driver from the Brother website and followed the instructions. I then installed the driver on my husband's laptop and it was just as easy. I think that if you just follow the on-screen directions, you'll have no problems at all.\n\nThe wireless is very nice, it doesn't have to stay connected to your router or anything. After you setup, you won't need to connect your computer to the printer either.\n\nThe duplex function is absolutely great! I used to have to sit next to my printer and click ok, flip (sometimes I'd flip it the wrong way), click ok...it was very tedious. This printer is quick and isn't loud at all (to me at least, and I had the Brother 2070N before this).\n\nToner is relatively cheap compared to other laser printers and they are much more efficient than inkjets. If you print a lot, this is the printer for you. You'll save money on paper with the auto duplexing and even more with the affordable toners.\n\nThe only ""complaint"" I have about this printer is that sometimes my husband will send a print job while he's upstairs and it scares me when it starts printing so suddenly!";Awesome Printer All Around!

97;15.0;1.0;79.0;1438;"Where can I start, this printer looked great and was the right price. I already own 3 other brother printers and have had a positive experience with them.\n\nMy experience with this printer was different. After installing the print driver I lost all print services in Windows 7. I couldn't print anything, and my print spooler became unresponsive.\n\nThe level 1 tech rep. at brother had me run basic diagnostics and then tried to send me off to my computer manufacturer. As I had lost all printing capabilities I demanded that he at least help me get basic printing back before I got off the line. He had me run the uninstall program provided by Brother, which did not fully uninstall the printer driver, and left a ton of garbage in the registry.\n\nI asked for level 2 tech support and was told it did not exist, then I asked for a supervisor (who apparently ""couldn't help me"") who told me that there was a level 2 support, and I was put on hold for 40+ minutes before finally being able to talk to level 2. Level 2 was a completely different experience. The representative was helpful and was able to get my printer working in short order.\n\nThe moral of the story is, if only I had been transferred to level 2 in a timely fashion, instead of spending 1 1/2+ hours of a very stressful day on the phone with Brother before being able to print again then perhaps I would rate the product based upon my experience happily using it and not my experience being lied to by a support rep. and having my time wasted. The fact that a Brother Level 1 (level 1 usually reads off a checklist) was perfectly happy leaving me without any ability to print says a great deal about their respect for the customer.\n\nAs far as using the printer, it seems fine (prints reasonably fast). Like my other Brother laser printers this one plays havoc with the electricity in my house. Turning the printer on or starting a print job causes the lights to flicker (it is on a 15 Amp circuit with a UPS and apparently the room lights). I hadn't thought about this until I was grumpily reading other reviews of this product while on hold with tech support, but it does seem like something that could be improved, as other laser printers don't seem to have such a dramatic effect.\n\nUPDATE: Still have this thing in my office to print envelopes. It randomly stopped working via wifi and I was forced to contact Brother support again. Their solution was to tie it to a fixed ip address and tell me to leave my printer on at all times (since it is getting its address through DHCP resetting the router or printer would lose this address, I'm inferring that, they didn't have the decency to explain it to me). I asked if I should just set my router to a fixed ip, and they said ""no, just leave your printer on all the time"". Obviously I'm not following their directions, but it seems that regular users (I'm thinking of my parents) would end up paying huge electric bills just because Brother has absolutely no idea how to support this product in a reasonable fashion.

100;46.0;3.0;17.0;1450;Bought this printer about 6 months ago. The printer is fine, a little noisier than I would like but since its in a different room its not an issue. The real issue is that the toner runs out very quickly, as do the replacement toners. Plus they are expensive. So even though this printer is inexpensive, be prepared to spend a lot more on toners. Plus the hassle of having the ink run out just when you really need the printer... In retrospect, I would have liked to have bought a printer where the toner lasts much longer. My previous printer was just great in that regard. Hence the 1 star rating.\n\n2/4/12 -- ok, I just found out that Brother starts to send 'low toner' messages to get you to buy more toner than you need. The toner cartridge has more than 30% of its ink left right now, so its actual printing capacity is ok. If you buy this printer, a web search will show you how to figure out the toner levels. Brother should be more judicious in sending out these warnings so early that it will cause people to replace their toners earlier than required. Thats just wrong. However, knowing what they are doing and how to work around it, I think its a fine printer for the price. I'm going to change my rating from one star to 3 stars. They lose 2 stars for not handling this issue correctly.;Before you buy, you need to know this about toner expenses
101;19.0;5.0;53.0;1452;"This is an excellent little printer; clear, fast, and hassle free.\n\nThe installation went smoothly for attaching it to wired ethernet network, I haven't tried wireless or USB so I can't comment there.  Although two things were a bit ambiguous about the instructions.  First, the matter of how it's connected to the network refers to how the printer is connected to the network.  Never mind that your computers may be connected wirelessly to the router.  The printer's connection is all that matters here.  Secondly, even though you may have an infrastructure (central router) based network, choose peer-to-peer as your network type.\n\nThe software installation was a bit surprising.  While most manufacturers embed a pile of useless software and some rather annoying add-ons like browser toolbars, the Brother allowed a clean and minimalist install.  It was quick and efficient, and it worked.  Just a solitary icon on the desktop that directs you to support if you need it.\n\nOne aspect of the printer driver that is rarely touched upon in the reviews, is the ""booklet"" mode.  I've often wanted to print items in a reduced size format that could be carried about easily.  I tested the function and chose a 15 page PDF document to print.  I merely set the printer driver for ""booklet - automatic"" and it printed perfectly; all of the pages in order, ready to fold and staple.  This is normally something you have to fiddle around with in a word processor to achieve.  For better or worse, the driver reverts to single page printing upon completion.  I like that, I don't want to send a stack of invoices to the printer and have them inadvertently printed as a booklet.\n\nAnother nice feature that's been overlooked is that the printed pages are delivered to the tray face down.  In other words, in order.  No more sorting them or having to print in reverse order, as is the case with ink jet printers.\n\nThe thing is blazingly fast; typically done with a job before I reach for it.  Print quality is very good.  Ninety percent of my work is in monochrome (or could be) so by having a dedicated black and white printer will save me a great deal of supplies.  Most color printer drivers don't give you an option of using the black only.  I'm sure everyone has experienced printing a flashy web page with a color ink jet printer and have the pages come out laden with ink and noticeably damp from printing all of the useless advertising and background colors.  Even more maddening, it now refuses to print a black and white document claiming the yellow has run out.  With this monochrome printer you don't have to worry about it.\n\nA number of reviews have commented on it's power consumption.  First there's the allegation that it's draws so much power that the lights dim in the house.  The problem here is that your building needs to have it's wiring upgraded.  In any case, the printer shouldn't be plugged into a circuit that also supplies room lighting.\n\nNext, there have been comments that it's not really energy saver, seemingly because the power LED remains on in dimmed mode when it's sleeping.  In fact, in only uses 0.9 watt when it sleeping (2.8 watts with WAN on); that's a lot less most modern appliances, such as TV's or microwaves.  Far less than a high speed modem or router.  It needs to consume some power in order to keep it's connection to the network on standby.  You can change the status of the power indicator to ""off when sleeping"" in the software if it makes you feel better, but why bother?  You can save a lot more energy by vacuum cleaning the coils beneath and behind your refrigerator.  (I know you haven't done that lately.)\n\nFinally, it's been stated that it draws 1,000 watts while printing.  Well, inrush perhaps.  But let's do the math based on the 1,000 watts.  In most cases 1,000 watts for an hour's time would cost you about ten cents.  Ignoring the time you'd spend reloading it with paper, and at 25 pages a minute, your cost in energy would be 0.00666 cents per page ($0.0000666).  Pretty cheap, all things considered.\n\nIt does exhibit a slight ""curling"" of the paper, particularly when using the duplex mode.  I switched to 24 lb. laser paper to combat this and noticed an improvement in print quality as well.  There is an option in the printer's software that supposedly will reduce paper curl.  I haven't tried it because I feel that the manufacturer would not have the default set to off unless there are performance issues associated with it's being on.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this printer.  For what it's designed for, a SOHO environment, it can't be beat.";Excellent little printer
102;11.0;2.0;102.0;1452;The printer has worked well for light use for two months. I just printed one document and the quality was perfectly fine, no evidence that the tonner is actually running out. Next thing, the tonner light gets on and it refuses to print any other document, saying that that the tonner is empty. I've had other printers before and I am totally convinced that this tonner could go on for many pages. It's annoying that they program the printer to stop printing early so that they get people to buy more tonners. I don't recomment it.;stops printing way before the toner is empty
103;13.0;5.0;98.0;1454;My wife and I finally got tired of replacing high-priced ink cartridges in our ink jet printer. The 26ml pigment black cartridges are about $15 each adding up to over $570 per liter. (We still have it and love it, a Canon MP 610, when we want to print in color). Before I retired, I used a Brother laser printer daily at my last employer. It always worked perfectly. Based on that experience I didn't hesitate to buy the HL-2270DW which also duplexes, prints both sides of the sheet. We've had it for a month, using it daily to print info from the internet and print out documents we generate. It has never made a mistake. It comes with a Quick Setup Guide for both Windows and Macintosh and an Installation CD-ROM. You can download an instruction manual from their website if you need one. You also need to provide a USB 2.0 cable (Type A/B) if you don't use the wireless feature. Set up only took a few minutes. One of the previous reviewers commented on paper jams. I worked most of my career in commercial print shops and 8 years selling paper to printers. After opening a ream of paper you need to fan the sheets apart to break the surface tension between them before loading the paper tray. That ream of paper was tightly wrapped at the mill, put into a carton and stacked onto a pallet that weighs 2,000 lbs. The individual sheets are stuck together and have no air between them.  That is the biggest cause of paper jams in copiers and printers. Also, the cheapest paper will have more dust particles that can stick to the drum and paper path in a laser printer or copier causing more printer problems. I recommend buying paper that's at least one level up from the bottom. I'm very pleased with my new printer and recommend it for a home or an office.;Great printer for home or small office
104;27.0;1.0;35.0;1463;"I purchased this because I needed a duplex, wireless printer. Unfortunately, despite having successfully at least 4 other non-computer devices to my wireless network in the past year or so, I was unable to get this printer connected.\n\nTo do the wireless setup, you're supposed to first connect the printer using either a USB cable or a network cable. I tried it both ways, but although setup said that the printer (sometimes) detected my wireless network, it never successfully connected to it; the diagnostics always either said I had the wrong wireless security type, or that the network couldn't be connected. Well, I tried changing my WiFi setup to about 4 different types of security and no luck.\n\nJust for fun I also tried configuring the printer through its web interface; although I could (sometimes) reach the printer that way, and could fiddle with the wireless settings there too, once again, no luck connecting.\n\nI think I attempted to set up the printer on my Wi-Fi about 8 times, each time trying something a little different, before I decided to throw in the towel and send it back. I figured I had tried enough different things that calling support would be a waste of time.\n\nThe only other item worth noting is that when the printer was warming up and preparing to print, the lights in the room dimmed briefly, so it's obviously sucking a lot of power occasionally. This didn't happen with my old laser printer, or with the new one I eventually got after returning this dud.";Multiple attempts at wireless setup all failed
105;96.0;5.0;7.0;1477;This Printer is perfect for my needs. I had an inkjet color, but used it infrequently and invariably had to buy a cartridge each time as it had dried out from non-use. A Laser Printer solves this problem. I'd have liked to have color, but it's not worth it to me to have to get cartidges constantly. Mostly I do Documents and it's great for that.\nI also printed a few large pictures in B&W with this, and they are pleasing to me, but bear in mind that you can see very very fine lines along the laser axis. I suspect this is common to this type of printer in this resolution. To the common eye the B&W photo's look fine and would be suitable for flyers coverpages etc for non-Corporate level business or personal projects.\nFor documents quality is A-1, Speed is great both in warmup which is literaly just a few seconds, and in repeat copies or additional pages. It's about average sound wise, a clunk on it's initial power-on precheck, which does not repeat with copying. A bit of a fan sound for cooling on standby, about average for a printer. I keep it off since it only takes a few seconds to warm up, there is no reason for me to have it on standby for personal use. It has a very small footprint, and blends in nicely with a variety of decor. I'd recommend, and in fact it's got me thinking about a color laser printer because I like the tech so much (not having to worry about it drying out).Also I used the duplex once on the test sheet, and it worked flawlessly. Since I'm filling out lots of forms and applications lately that are inately double sided I know this feature will come in handy. It seemed to work flawlessly the few times I tried it.;Great Little Printer For Documents and Basic Graphics.
106;120.0;5.0;5.0;1482;"well, there have already been a good number of really in-depth, fantastic reviews here for this printer, so there's no need for me to rehash everything that has been said. at the same time, i just wanted to put my two cents in and add one more positive review to the list.\n\ni've wanted a laser printer for years. i rarely ever print in color, inkjets are painfully slow, and the cost of cartridges for inkjets... we all know it's gouging, to say the least. i've also always wanted a wireless printer. previously, i had an old, bulky HP all-in-one, and i never had enough space anywhere within cable length. it was always in the way. i ended up hooking it up, printing what i needed to, then unhooking it and storing it in the closet until next time. inconvenient, to say the least.\n\nso, i know my requirements are a) want it to be a laser printer and b) it really would be nice if it were wireless.\n\nup until recently, laser printers were just out of my reasonable price range... and the whole ""wireless"" printer trend didn't really pick up until the last year or two, it seems. to get the two together, you were certainly not going to break the sub $100 price point. on top of that, at the cheaper end of things, you weren't going to get a high-quality printer.\n\nthis all changed the moment i saw this one here. i'd had my eye on it for about half a year... but it was still $150+, and my clunky old printer still technically ""worked"". happened to be at a national retailer and saw they had it on sale for $99, and was excited. i got on here and read the reviews and all looked good.\n\nreceived it as a gift, set it up... and i am very pleased that this is not the piece of junk that i always expected would be had at this price. i'll just go over some bullet points and reiterate what some of the other reviewers have pointed out in places.\n\n1) it does have 3 interfaces: USB, ethernet/wired, and of course, the gem... wireless.\n\n2) this thing is fast. it can come out of power-saving mode and have your page ready to go in... i would estimate, roughly 5 seconds.\n\n3) it has multiple ""management"" interfaces once you get your IP address and all set. you have the built-in web interface like a lot of the business laser printers (just go to the printer's IP address in your web browser); you also have some software that is downloadable from their website called ""BRadmin light"", which will do some basic maintenance/configuration functions. you can also get some info from the print monitor, which i believe can be disabled (for those who hate huge popup windows that talk and turn a simple print job into a multimedia display... ehem, HP). what happened to the normal windows print queue?\n\n4) as mentioned, the toner cartridge that it comes with is a ""starter"" one, which supposedly will do 700 pages. you may want to consider putting the printer into toner save mode, where it just basically does what other printers would call a draft copy... just lighter lettering, but perfectly fine if it's just for you to read or reference.\n\n5) duplexing is just an added bonus; it wasn't something i really ""needed"", but it's a good paper-saver and i haven't had any troubles with it like some have reported. possibly try a heavier weight of paper. maybe the paper is too thin/light and when it goes to duplex, it catches up somewhere. also, someone mentioned duplex paper curling -- there's actually a feature that you can enable that is supposed to prevent or reduce that.\n\n6) i'd recommend getting the latest drivers from the brother website, as the latest version was only released less than a week ago. it also has the ability for firmware upgrades, but mine was already at the current revision out of the box.\n\nso if you're looking for a compact, wireless, fast, and seemingly high-quality printer... this is one of the best you're going to find for this price. if the high yield toner is 40 something dollars, that's two inkjet cartridges! the high yield toner cartridge is supposed to last roughly 2,500 pages. if you're not a super-heavy printer, that's forever. i'm happy with the product, and i would definitely recommend it to a friend; do not regret the decision at all.\n\noh... there is one important thing to know about laser printers if you have never owned one or really worked with them much. their sleep and standby modes don't use too much power -- but they have one crappy feature, and that is the ""working load"" or how many watts they use while actually in running mode. it can be as much as 500w or more, depending on the size of it. in my house (which has crappy electrical work done, it has always seemed) it will actually flicker the lights in the room when it kicks into gear or when it's first powering up. this can be a bit annoying. because of this huge peak power usage, it's not recommended to plug them up to a UPS (battery backup), at least on the side that actually has battery+surge protection. it would be fine on the surge only side. hooking it up to a consumer UPS (battery side) could cause anything from it going into ""undervoltage"" warnings, to premature death of battery/unit from the constant high draws. just a little knowledge i've picked up working with them. look in the notes/specs for ""peak usage (energy/watts)"" or something like that, and it should give you a better idea -- but if you have a lot of stuff on the same circuit as the printer... don't be surprised if your lights do a really quick flicker when this thing goes into motion!";can't beat this quality/feature set for the price!
107;22.0;5.0;45.0;1494;I rarely use a printer and because of that, every time I went to use my ink jets, they would be clogged. I tried cleaning them with limited success but usually, I had to throw them out and buy new ones. I recently went to purchase new color and black ink cartridges at a local Staples and after expressing my frustration at the constant failure of ink jets, the guy recommended I get a black and white laser printer if I didn't really care about color. I had no idea they had come down in price so much (they were in the thousands back when I paid any attention to them).\n\nAnyhow, SO happy with this printer. It works every single time I turn it on to use it. I live in a very dry climate now so no more worrying about ink drying up - it uses dry toner. It prints double-sided and it also has built in wireless so I don't even have any cables running to it from my computers. I couldn't be happier with this thing, especially for the price. One thing to note, however, is that the toner cartridges are a little more expensive than ink jet but on the plus side of that, Brother claims an average of 1200 pages from that, which is much more than you would ever get out of a black ink cartridge.;FInally free of the curse of ink jets
108;86.0;4.0;8.0;1495;I've been without a printer for 2 years as a now seemingly pointless personal protest against high price inkjet refills. I pulled the trigger and purchased this machine after reading all of the positive reviews. So far (30 minutes now) I am completely impressed with the printer. Duplex is EASY and completely hands off - it works great right out of the box.\n\nWireless setup? It's completely RIDICULOUS (in a GOOD way). My desktop computer, the main house pc is upstairs in the living room. However I placed the printer downstairs next to my laptop. My laptop was a breeze to set up with wireless - no problem it's literally a foot from the printer. But the desktop upstairs had me nervous. My nerves were pointless, didn't do anything but waste brain cells because the connection to the desktop was even easier - even though it's an entire floor away from the printer. I'm loving it so far.\n\ni just hope the toner holds up. I recommend this puppy!;Wicked easy wireless setup
109;97.0;5.0;7.0;1498;I bought this printer because I was having major driver issues with my old HP LaserJet. I heard that Brother offers solid Linux support so I decided to give this a try.\n\nNetworked printing is great (I use ethernet since the printer is sitting next to my router) -- easy setup on wife's XP computer.\n\nWith the cupswrapper provided by Brother, I can also print from my Arch Linux box. Duplexing even works.\n\nVery happy with this printer.;This thing is great
110;48.0;1.0;17.0;1504;"I bought this black friday. I thought I got a great deal on this, until I found that it will not work with my Linksys WRT54G wireless router. This will only work with access points that have AOSS. Now black friday is over, and I have to take the thing back. Why did brother make a wireless printer that will only with a few, very select, access points? And why didn't they tell anybody this ""feature"" before they sold it?";WARNING! Does not work with most access points
111;57.0;4.0;13.0;1510;This is an impressive little workhorse of a printer. Print quality is sharp, it's fast, and the duplexing works well. The drawbacks are that the setup is overly complicated and you will need to follow the cryptic instructions in the manual closely. However, once it's up and running it works well. One warning, it's much louder than most other printers.;Efficient, reliable, no frills laser printer
112;5.0;5.0;367.0;1522;"This is a nice, compact laser printer with good build quality.\n\nWireless was essential for me - I've been waiting quite a while for a wireless laser that had reliably great reviews.  I unpacked the box, removed the plastic strips, scanned the quick start guide, plugged the printer in, and everything was great so far.  I then downloaded the newest drivers from the Brother website (drivers on included CD's are usually 3-12 month old) for my Windows 7 x64 and Windows 7 x32 laptops; executing the driver programs walks you through setup.  In the past for wireless products, I've found you usually have to first set them up on a wired (Ethernet or USB) connection, then change things over to wireless.  I decided to test the technological development level and go straight to wireless setup, starting with the 64-bit machine.  This consisted of inserting the tip of a pen [you could also use a paperclip, etc] into the wireless setup button hole, telling the printer to start looking for a router; then I ran downstairs, pushed/held the WPS button on my wireless router, telling it to start looking for another device - in one minute they met, and fell in love.  That was it.  The driver installation software (on the wireless 64-bit laptop) detected they had a successful partnership and moved on to the final screens.  Windows 7 had installed the printer with all of the advanced menus and controls.  I then installed the driver on the 32-bit laptop and it auto-detected the successful partnership without touching any hardware - very simple install and wireless printing was ready to go.\n\nI never bit with the wireless inkjet offerings, as the long term operating costs of inkjets are crazy.  I've been refilling the toner cartridges on laser printers for years, running them for so cheap it's amazing.  If this unit just had laser printing and reliable wireless it would be a fantastic deal.  However, it has many features which are totally surprising. This review is already too long so I'll just say that the auto duplexing is great.  What is even cooler is the Booklet feature.  I'm holding in my hand a 20-page PDF that I selected ""Booklet"" in the options while printing.  It printed on both sides of the paper, reduced the pages to half-sheets, arranged the pages in the precise/complicated order, and output tiny stack of FIVE sheets (from 20).  I folded the stack in half and viola - a perfect booklet that is more convenient to travel with and uses one-quarter of the paper!  I'm not sure you can know how cool this is until you actually have a booklet in your hand - so buy this machine now and see for yourself.\n\nOne final caution, the supplier I normally order bulk toner from does not yet have the formulation for this printer.  I'm sure they will in time, but for now you might actually have to buy the TN450 replacement cartridge which runs at roughly 2.2 cents per page, once the 700-page starter cartridge is exhausted.\n\nI've only had this printer for a few days, so hopefully it lives up to my current expectations and retains its 5-star rating.  To be honest, these things are going for less than a hundred (on sale + coupon, at office supply stores) and at that price point just straight laser printing with wireless is a great deal.";insane value & easy setup
113;18.0;4.0;58.0;1524;Our faithful TN2100 drum went out and could not find a replacement! Needed to get a laser printer fast and found this new model on sale at Fry's. Local stores do not even have them on display and try to talk you out of buying this! But, this is a great printer for the price. Looks and feels flimsy when compared to TN2100. But, all printers in this price range feel the same.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good print quality, even in their Tone Saver Mode.\n2. Easy to setup as a dedicated printer via USB.\n3. Equally easy to setup as a wired printer.\n4. Wireless setup is OK, but see the cons below.\n5. While the duplexing took several tries to work properly, eventually got it to work well. You need to get into the printer advanced features to set up the correct duplexing for your need. Default did not work well for us.\n6. Option to print multiple pages on a sheet works pretty well.\n\nCons:\n\n1. In wireless mode, it is hard to print large files. After investigating, their document states that for best operation, wireless connectivity should not have walls and large objects in between. They recommend wired connectivity for printing large files.\n\nWe found that setting up this printer as a peer-to-peer wired printer attached to a wireless router to be the best option. This way, it appears as a wireless printer that can print large files without any problems. Unless you want to locate the printer away from the wireless router, this option seems to be the best.\n\nAs others have commented, error codes are not intuitive, but we got used to it. They have used a hex code for several error conditions using 4 available LEDs. Not bad to bring the cost down. But, for a new user, it can be irritating. Just remember, only Red Error LED blinking is Paper Jam and Only Red Error LED on is No Paper.;Decent Printer
114;98.0;5.0;7.0;1525;I have 40 years in the IT industry, and I'm not in the habit of reading the instructions, unless all else fails. I changed my normal routine, for this printer installation, because I had read a number of reviews that slammed the Brother documented installation process. I followed the Brother installation process for a wireless installation exactly, to see if it was truly as bad as some reviews had said. One qualifier is worth mentioning though, you need to know your routers SSID and your WEP/WPA security code(which I did), or follow Brother's instructions to find them(which I didn't try).\n\nTo install the printer, you need to connect your pc to the printer, and 3 methods are described (usb cable, ethernet cable, or ad-hoc connection). I chose to connect via an ethernet cable, and the installation process worked flawlessly. The only thing that I felt wasn't covered was reserving the IP address that was assigned to the printer. That, of course, was more in the relm of the router than the printer.\n\nOnce the printer was available on the network, I installed drivers on workstations running winxp, vista, and PCLinuxOS 2010, all without significant problems. A specific driver for the HL-2270dw was not available in the PCLinuxOS 2010 PCC, but the driver for the the HL-2170w works and surprisingly supports duplexing.\n\nI'm not concerned about the cost, or the availability of toner cartridges at this time, because by the time I need one, the same third party vendors who sell the HL-2170 cartridge will be selling TN-450 compatible cartridges at a competitive price. That's why they're in business.\n\nUpdate (2/18/2011) Third party high yield toner cartridges are now available on ebay for $38.62. This price includes shipping and a 180 days Unconditional Warranty.;Easy Wireless Installation
115;2.0;5.0;3100.0;1527;"The Brother HL-2270DW is the follow-up to the immensely popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HL-2170W/dp/B0010Z3LGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HL-2170W</a>.  The 2170W was popular for its amazing value and print quality.  It was also wildly popular because of a neat toner trick to get it to print more pages out of the toner, even when the printer claimed the toner needed replacing.  The one big knock of the 2170W was the difficult wireless setup and for being only able to use one network connection at a time-- either Ethernet or WiFi.  The 2270DW adds an automatic duplexer and also improves performance.\n\nPROS:\n- Fast, fast, fast\n- Great print quality\n- 3 connectivity options including WiFi\n- Automatic duplexer\n- Supports Windows XP/2000/Vista/7, Mac OS X, and various Linux distros\n- Good looking\n- Great value\n\nCONS:\n- Starter toner rated at only 700 pages\n- Slight curl for duplex printouts\n- Uses different and more expensive toner than 2170W\n- WiFi limited to 802.11b/g\n\nOnce upon a time, I used to have an NEC laser printer, a generic scanner, and an Epson photo printer all on my desk.  Well that got old and I consolidated to a multifunction printer and the last 3 printers I owned have all been color inkjet MFP's.  The advantages were many but the one drawback was major.  The cost per page for inkjet prints became huge, even when printing in black & white.  Many color inkjet printers still use color inks when printing in black & white, thus requiring you to replace not only the black ink cartridges, but some of the color ones as well.  For me, magenta and yellow frequently ran out, even though we ONLY ever printed in black & white.  I'd finally had enough and sought out a solution.  As recently as 3 weeks ago, I was able to purchase the 2170W for my parents for a great price and was going to get one myself but they all went out of stock or had gone up in price.  Then I found out that they were being discontinued and the 2270DW was the newer model.  I pulled the trigger and have not looked back.\n\n2270DW vs. 2170W\nThe difference between the older 2170W and the newer 2270DW isn't limited to just the change in exterior color.  Considering that the base MSRP remains the same, the 2270DW is an outstanding bargain.  The 2270DW is slightly faster at 27ppm vs. 22ppm for the 2170W.  The 2270DW also uses a 200MHz processor vs. the old 181MHz CPU.  The dimensions are identical except that the 2270DW is half an inch taller and happens to weigh almost a half a pound more.  I'm guessing the automatic duplexer is responsible for the slightly larger size.  Brother also decided to get cheap and included a starter toner rated for only 700 pages, whereas the 2170W was 1000 pages or 2 full reams of paper.  The 2270DW also adds GDI printing\n\nINSTALL\nThe toner and drum are pre-installed but you have to remove it and prep (shake) it before use.  I found the Quick Start Guide to be pretty clear and useful for all three connection methods.  WiFi configuration is still a bit hokey, but it was easy enough in my opinion.\n\n(USB)\nThe USB install was a cinch.  Install the drivers off of the disc or download them from Brother's website, then plug the USB cable (not included) into your computer and you're good to go.\n(Ethernet)\nThough the printer's wireless abilities are nice to have, I prefer to use the Ethernet connection to plug the printer directly into my wireless router.  This still allows me to print wirelessly from my laptop and via a hardware switch from my desktop.  I also don't have to fiddle with the wireless settings and have a stronger, more reliable connection through my router.  Using the install wizard, I selected Peer-to-Peer Network Printer as my preferred network print type and was off and running.  I performed the same setup on my laptop over WiFi and installed perfectly.  One note, I could not quickly find the MAC address to the Ethernet port so I disabled MAC filtering on my router temporarily.  If you don't use MAC filtering, then you have nothing to worry about.  Afterwards, I found out that you can print the settings from within the Brother print driver and find the MAC address.\n(WiFi)\nI think a lot of people think they need a WiFi printer to print wireless but most people have wireless routers already that they can just connect the printer to with an Ethernet cable.  A printer with WiFi is really only useful if it won't be attached to your router and want it completely independent.  As with the 2170W, the 2270DW requires it to be temporarily connected by USB cable or Ethernet to configure the wireless settings, unless, your wireless router supports WiFi Protected Setup or AOSS.  The installation wizard on the CD-ROM is pretty straight-forward and I found the install to be painless.  Although, if you are using MAC filtering and not broadcasting your SSID, you'll probably want to reverse those temporarily to configure it then switch it back.  This is especially true if you are trying to configure the WiFi AFTER you've already set it up by Ethernet and using BRAdmin to do it.  To find the internal wireless card's MAC address, hold down the Go button for 10 seconds until it prints a network config page that will enable/disable WiFi and also show you the MAC address.  I don't really need WiFi so I only performed the install for the sake of reviewing the procedure.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nTime to print has been improved on the 2270DW by nearly 2 seconds, so less time warming up from sleep or off.  The actual print speed improvement is less noticeable but 27ppm is insanely fast.  I thought my Consumer Reports #1 rated,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-All-in-One-Printer/dp/B002MCZIUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP All-in-One Printer</a>&nbsp;was pretty fast, but the 2270DW is at least twice as fast.  Text output, even really tiny fonts, looked great.  Graphics were also very good.  The 2270DW still supports the most current PCL printer language, developed by HP.  Oddly though, Brother decided to add GDI capabilities, which is also known as host-based printing and is typically used on low-end printers that put all the printer processing burden on the PC, rather than on the printer's hardware.  For example, Brother's bare-bones, cheap 2140 laser printer is GDI only.  The 2270DW already has PCL 6 support so I don't see any benefit to having GDI.  Even if using a high-end PC might possibly achieve faster to-print speeds, I would think the extra load put on the PC would be a hindrance over just letting the printer's hardware take care of it.  I would personally never buy a GDI-only printer.  Lastly, given how recently this printer was released, I'm disappointed they didn't include the better 802.11n Wifi support.\n\nNOISE\nThe 2270DW is noisier than the 2170W, so if you didn't like the 2170W for its noise, then you definitely won't like the noise from the 2270DW.  The fan does stay on for several minutes after it prints but shuts off eventually and then becomes totally silent.  The sounds of a laser printer are a welcome change from the wonky noises that my inkjet printers made.\n\nDUPLEXER\nIf you decide to use the automatic duplexer, it will add more time to your printouts, but what a convenience to not have to manually flip over sheets of paper.  Brother rates the duplexer speed to 10 sides per minute.  I've always liked the idea of using both sides of a sheet of paper.  Save them trees!  The duplexer on the 2270DW works well and I have not had any jams, knock on the wood of one of those trees I just saved.  Aside from having network printing, the duplexer is my favorite feature of the 2270DW.  The only downside to using the duplexer is that it has a noticeable curl.  A commenter suggested that heavier paper (24 lb) as opposed to the more commonly used 20 lb paper might help reduce the curl and paper jams.\n\nSOFTWARE\nThe drivers for the 2270DW include a lot of customization options for your printer, including using the Toner Saver Mode, which is similar to Draft Mode in inkjet printers.  Unless you are printing a resume, the Toner Saver Mode is more than good enough for daily print jobs.  Additionally, Brother laser printers have the ability to upgrade firmware.  Given that the 2270DW is brand new, this is an important ability to note because bug fixes and performance improvements are sure to become available down the road.  The most current version of the firmware as of this writing is v1.02.  You can also install various administrator utilities for configuration and monitoring (BRAdmin).  I used BRAdmin to change the Sleep time from 3 minutes to 2.  Another neat feature is that you can use web based management by putting the IP address of your printer into a web browser.  This is a great way to review settings and other useful information like how many pages you've printed, remaining drum life, serial number, and firmware version.\n\nCOST PER PAGE\nThe high-yield (2600 pages)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/genuine-Brother-toner/dp/B003YFHCKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">genuine Brother toner</a>&nbsp;(TN450) from Amazon is currently $46, which equates to about 1.8 cents per page.  That is ridiculous!  It is so much cheaper than most inkjets, which can cost between 4 cents and 8 cents per page of text.  The only bummer is that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brother-drum-unit/dp/B003YFHBE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brother drum unit</a>&nbsp;(DR420) currently costs $84.  At that price, if my 2270DW's drum needed replacing, I would probably just end up buying a new printer.  The drum is rated at 12,000 pages, which is 24 reams of paper.  A lot of factors go into when the drum unit should be replaced but given that I personally don't print more than a ream of paper per year, it would last me 24 years, or basically the life of the printer.  Factoring in the cost of a new drum unit, I calculated the cost per page to only increase to 2.5 cents per page.  Whenever 3rd party toner cartridges become available, the overall cost is sure to drop even more.\n\nMISC\nRE: Toner trick.  I believe Brother wised up and created the new TN450 toner specifically to address the toner trick.  I could not find any holes or openings in the toner or drum unit that could be covered up like the 2170W's TN360 toner.  As long as I get close to the rated output for the toner, I'm ok with this.  One of the reasons why the toner trick for the 2170W was so lauded is because Brother's method for measuring the toner was inaccurate.  I am hopeful that they have improved their measurement method and the trick is no longer necessary.\n\nI love the 250 sheet main paper tray because I no longer have to feed the paper tray on a monthly basis.  The manual feed ""slot"" only accepts one sheet at a time to feed labels and envelopes.  Since I use self-adhesive envelopes, I refrained from printing on them.  Also, though I was very tempted to, I did not feed any of my inkjet labels through the manual feed slot.  Brother does not recommend using inkjet paper due to the risk of paper jams.\n\nI found the multifunctional ""Go"" button to be confusing.  I think a cheat sheet card would have been very helpful to keep all the functions straight.  For example, you can hold it down for various lengths of time to make it do different things like reprinting the last print job or pushing it several times in order to continue printing when the low toner warning light comes on.\n\nThe 2270DW uses more energy during printing than the 2170W, but less in standby mode.\n\nOut of the 11 monochrome laser printers that Consumer Reports tested, only 2 garnered their ""Recommended"" rating.  Both were Brother printers.\n\nCONCLUSION\nI can't imagine the Brother HL-2270DW not reaching the same heights that the HL-2170W did.  The 2270DW performs very well, has great features, and is inexpensive to buy and to operate.  If I didn't still need a scanner, my HP multifunction printer would be banished from my home.  I highly recommend the Brother HL-2270DW for any home, home office or small office.";Extreme Review Of Extraordinary Printer
116;6.0;5.0;194.0;1535;I dumped my one year old HP 8000 wireless inkjet when it became obvious it was going to cost me two hundred dollars a year for even minimum use. You can read my review on that pig's product page for more details.\n\nAs with most users I have no expertise in wireless.  Every time I add a device, it's plug-and-pray time. My network is run through an old Asus router which supports only WEP and WPA, not WPS. I don't know exactly what that means, other than that WPS apparently is a new standard which improves the installation process.  My home network has slowly grown to inlude a W7 desktop, a Vista laptop, two other XP desktops (I never throw away old computers), one wireless adapter for my TV and bluray player, and one wireless printer.\n\nI have to say that this Brother printer was the easiest installation experience I have ever had with any piece of wireless hardware.  For once, a manufacturer went to obvious effort to make certain the manual was clear and coherent.  Every step on every page is exactly representative of what was shown on the screen [Update: Mac users, see Rich Hayhurst's comment (below)]. Every paragraph is bulleted so that if you are directed to skip a step based on your particular configuration there is no confusion as to where to proceed.\n\nThe net result is that, though I could not use what is billed as the one-button WPS setup and had to input the SSID and network key manually (I'm glad I wrote those down a couple years ago when I first set up the router), the Brother printer was recognized and up and running on all three active computers in less than twenty minutes, total.  All for little more effort than inserting the installation disk in each drive.\n\nThe print quality is excellent, the automatic duplex functions flawlessly, the machine is fast, quiet and has a very small footprint.  I am hoping its economy and durability live up to the rest of my initial experience with this great little printer.\n\np.s.: Anybody want to buy a wireless inkjet, cheap?\n\nUpdate 12/2/10 -- I do notice the paper curling (due to heat, I'm sure) some other reviewers have described.  It's possible a heavier weight paper would lessen this but I haven't had a chance to experiment, yet.  This curling might be an issue for business users who are concerned about quality of presentation in printed correspondence.  It's perfectly acceptable for my general personal uses.\n\nOne minor tip: If you get this printer, keep in mind the paper feed in this unit is towards the front of the tray.  I'm accustomed to the top of the sheet feeding towards the rear of the tray. I was printing adhesive labels and having alignment problems until I realized this difference.;Have no fear.  Easiest wireless setup, ever.
117;61.0;4.0;12.0;1538;"I just bought this printer at Staples for $149 a few days ago. I almost went with the cheaper one but I wanted wireless and auto duplexing. It's a bit early for a review but seeing there are not many I figured I'd add my 2 cents and then update when I've had it longer.\n-Setup wasn't too bad, USB is pretty simple to install. To get it on the wireless network I connected it directly to my router then logged into my router to get the printer IP assigned to it. At this point you can use your PC's browser to access the unit via IP. The web interface is ok and wireless was easy enough to setup from there.\n-Speed and print quality are very good, you wait longer for your PC to send the print job than anything else.\n-The printer feels pretty sturdy compared to what you pay for the unit and it's not too loud but does make more noise than an inkjet.  Seeing it's wireless you can hide it anywhere you have power so maybe put it where you don't have to hear the fan run.\n-The auto duplexing seems to work good so far. By default the driver is set to have it off but easy enough to set to on. One quark with it is when set to on it still pulls the paper back in to print on the other side even if you are printing 1 page.\n-I would have given the unit 4.5 stars if I could but not quite worthy of 5 because of some of the oddities. One being all you have is one ""Go"" button and 4 LEDs on the unit. If you run out of paper all you get is the ""Error"" LED so not very intuative. You can go to the web interface via the name and see what the error is otherwise you have to guess. No out of paper popup on the PC that I could find. The web interface also has other useful info like pages printed and toner/drum life left.\n\nAll in all I like the printer and hope it serves us better and more cheaply than our inkjets.  With 3 kids constantly printing papers for school plus 2 adults, we needed a cheaper solution than paying $60 for a pair of ink cartridges that only last a month or 2.";Nice laser printer for the buck.
118;23.0;1.0;45.0;1545;I bought this from the local Staples because it was in stock and the same price.  But it's a royal pain in the butt to set up for wireless (I highly recommend the USB option) and once it was set up, the duplexer mangled 4 out of every 5 sheets.  The main reason I got this printer was because of the built in duplexer, and so this was really disappointing.  I am going to return it to Staples and perhaps get another one to see if the duplexer was a one-time issue.  But now I'm worried that the duplexer will crap out after my return period ends, which would annoy me no end.;Good printer, crappy duplexer
119;14.0;5.0;86.0;1563;I bought this from a retail OfficeDepot outlet. OfficeDepot and OfficeMax are the only websites that seem to carry this printer at the moment and only OfficeDepot would actually let me order it -- and it turned out my local OfficeDepot store actually had exactly ONE of these in-stock, which I promptly purchased.\n\nWhy? It's perfect for what I needed:\n\n- Wireless to eliminate cable clutter, enable locating it in the most convenient spot, and enable printing from my girlfriend's laptop from anywhere in the house.\n\n- It's a laser printer, so it prints faster and cheaper than an inkjet -- of course there's no color, but if we need that that's what a specialized graphics/photo printer is for. This is just for text and things that don't require color or extremely detailed graphics, which is 99.9% of what I print (the text and graphics are perfectly crisp though, don't get me wrong).\n\n- It's got auto-duplexing, so you don't waste half (the blank back-side) of your paper when you don't need to and don't have to waste time manually flipping the paper with printers that only do manual-duplexing. Saves space, time, and money.\n\n- Easy to set-up via the included CD, assuming you're not totally clue-less with computers. You'll need a USB cable to go between your computer and the printer, or an ethernet cable to go between your router and the printer, to set up the wireless for the first time. No, there's no LCD screen or any way to set it up without your computer, but you can't expect things like that in this price bracket.\n\n- It's cheap. Only printer in the ~$150 price range I could find that's laser with wireless and auto-duplexing.\n\nThe only reasons I docked one star from the rating:\n\n- No third-party toner is available yet. Brother made new toner cartridges for these 2200-series models, and finding even that toner is tough. So, there's no ultra-cheap third-party toner available yet (that I can find), but even with the Brother toner cartridges it runs about 3.5 cents per page with the regular cartridge or about 2.5 cents if you get the high-yield. Still pretty good.\n\n- OfficeDepot is the only place you can seem to find this printer anywhere at the moment. I dunno if they got it early, if this model is delayed or discontinued before it's even really come out and I'm a bit afraid I'll end up having a printer I can't find toner/service for at all.\n\nBut, assuming I'm supposed to have it, this is the perfect home/home-office/small-business laser printer. Highly recommended (once you can actually find it)!;Am I even supposed to have this printer yet?

0;1.0;1.0;5.0;0;"Let me first say that I certainly wouldn't buy it. I'm not a die-hard star wars fan, I'm more of the ""big-fan-but-wouldn't-dress-up-as-a-SW-character"" type.\nSecondly, I wouldn't actually call this a movie. It's more of a string of scenes, each containing one or more rather lame Star Wars ""innuendos"". After it finished (all nine minutes of it), it left me asking : ""So the point of that was what, exactly ?"".\nThe sheer cheesiness of it all is extremely off-putting and kills any entertainment value it might otherwise have had quicker than a lightsaber through the heart. Forget the cheesiness of ""Scary Movie""- that was forgivable because it was genuinely funny; this isn't even slightly so.\nThere is just one thing I can say about this collection to it's credit : It avoided the ""I am your father"", ""Nooooo !"" cliche (but only just). I swear, if I hear that one once more I'm going to go and bay at the moon.";This should be proton-torpedoed out of existence.
1;5.0;5.0;5.0;44;"""George Lucas in Love"" is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen.  What if George Lucas, the creator of the ""Star Wars"" movies, had a muse, like ""Shakespeare in Love"" suggests that the Bard did?  Well, imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC, struggling to create a short picture.  And then the fun begins.  This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes.  I've watched it over a dozen times, and each time I see another joke that I missed before.";The funniest 8 minute short ever!
2;7.0;5.0;6.0;215;"Any fan of George Lucas and of Star Wars -- I'm a hardcore fan of both -- will love this movie. It is clever, witty, and well-crafted, perfectly balancing the directorial styles of Shakespeare in Love (Steadicam shots, lighting) with Star Wars (Lucasian wipes, close-up shots, pans). Some of the most subtle jokes were my favorite, such as the ""womp rats"" line, the Howard the Duck reference, and the THX 1138 door sign.\nEnjoy!";The Force is strong with this one...
3;20.0;5.0;6.0;900;"George Lucas in Love may very well be the ""Form"" of a short film - what the perfect short film should be, in a higher realm of understanding.  A low-budget, well-shot, beautifully scored, and endlessly engaging piece of work, Joe Nussbaum's clever little feature never falls into film-school pretentiousness or short-film stupidity.  Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.\nThe 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins ""Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.""  His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to ""write what he knows.""  What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nAs much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - ""Evil Hill"" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of ""didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).\nThe DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a ""making of"" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.\nIs it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.  Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them.";Wow and Wow Again!
4;18.0;5.0;7.0;1123;"The sentiment of ""why buy it when you can download it for free?"" isn't even close to being valid here. It's just not possible to appreciate the excellent production and effort that went into this short on a jumpy computer screeen.  This is a real film, worthy of a full-size theater. Lacking that, your TV is the next best thing. Even if you already have the VHS, you won't regret buying the DVD. It's not just the lovely print and sound of the title short, but the copious extras which make this DVD a real bargain. The background and commentary on George Lucas in Love is great, though much of the information is repeated in various forms. Still, it's fun to know how this short came about, and to realize it was truly a professional production all the way around. The additional short films are great to have as well, though you can tell their budgets are far smaller than that of GLIL! Swing Blade is laugh-out-loud funny, but the Film Club short is not to be overlooked. It's a spot-on parody of the Fight Club trailer--the detail is perfect, right down to Brad Pitt's gestures and Edward Norton's expressions. Any fan of Fight Club (and if you have a DVD player you MUST have a copy of Fight Club, right?) will get a big kick out of it. The Evil Hill parody--despite a terrific Dr. Evil impression by Timothy Dowling--is slow and uninspired. This is the guy who thought a live-action Rugrats movie would be a good idea. Mr. Dowling is clearly talented, but judging from this work he needs to stay friends with people who can tell him when his ideas stink. Come to think of it, George Lucas could use a bit of that kind of help as well.";Well worth the money
5;19.0;5.0;7.0;1156;I've seen other Star Wars parodies, and this one is up there with the best of them, not only parodying Star Wars, but 1999 Best Picture Shakespeare in Love.  It is well researched into Lucas' undergraduate life at USC, and even references 2 of his student films.  It also captures even the littlest and obscure Star Wars references.  A short film in 8 minutes, it's worth the admission price!;One of the best parodies!
6;27.0;4.0;5.0;1161;"Just received my DVD of ""Lucas"" and the other films and thought that Lucas looked much better on the DVD than on the internet.  I especially liked ""Swingblade"" but how come no comments from those guys?  Also, Film Club was good but I didn't get all the references.  All in all a great group of films!";loved it!
7;22.0;1.0;6.0;1171;A 30 second joke told over and over.  You can almost feel thesmarm lapping around your ankles.;Blissfully short - but still too long
8;8.0;5.0;14.0;1198;I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out, with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs, with its jabs, too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love, I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!\nWhat's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen, that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!;Great fun, in the Hardware Wars tradition!
9;23.0;5.0;6.0;1213;"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and previewed ""to be sure it ran fine.""  LOL  I have watched this movie short about 6 times now and everytime I watch it I see yet another reference to the Star Wars Trilogy or Shakespear In Love.  A must have for the Star Wars enthusiast.";Well Worth the Pitance Spent
10;21.0;5.0;7.0;1294;Liked it much I did.  Humor intelligent, details done well they were.;Clever It Was.
11;24.0;5.0;6.0;1297;If you've seen the Trilogy, and are at least a semi-star wars fan, you'll LOVE this movie.. It covers so much in 8 minutes, that it doesn't seem that  short. I don't think I've laughed so hard in years! One thing, tho.. Don't  let anyone tell you anything about it. Just watch it. You'll love it!;This movie is Awesome!
12;14.0;4.0;8.0;1306;This is a very enjoyable 9-minute movie, and you don't have to be a diehard Star Wars fanatic to enjoy it.  You just have to have seen the 3 initial movies.  The price is a bit high ($12 including shipping), but  worth it if you'll split the price with some friends.  After all,  Blockbuster doesn't have it.\nBUT, don't look at the box or talk with  people about it before watching it.  Remember, it's only 9-minutes long.  There are lots of scenes on the box that you'll find quite funny in the  movie if you're NOT already anticipating them.  Don't lose the fun of half  the movie by seeing half the jokes beforehand.;Great, but DON'T LOOK AT THE BOX BEFOREHAND
13;4.0;5.0;32.0;1313;Reading many of these reviews after having seen the movie myself, I've come to the conclusion MANY seem to agree with: This was an amazing film, and those who criticize it are upset that they didn't think of the idea  first! It was a 9-minute independent film, and yet wove through Star Wars,  George Lucas, and Shakespeare in Love so slyly, that you must applaud Mr.  Nussbaum, Mr. Dowling, and Mr. Levy for an amazing piece of cinema.\nTo  those who criticize, go ahead and nag! The people, however, have spoken,  making it the most downloaded movie ever on the Internet, and I understand  that Mr. Nussbaum is the talk of Hollywood as the next big director out of  USC. Don't take my word for it - Read the Wall Street Journal, People  Magazine, and the New York Times! If the biggest complaint is that 'Lucas'  isn't long enough, it's a testament to the genius and skill of those  involved. Bravo!;Everyone's a Critic!  'Lucas' was Phenomenal!
14;12.0;5.0;12.0;1317;"GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE is a parody of ""Shakespeare in Love"" featuring the life of a 1967 George Lucas in USC film school.  This film is less than 10 minutes long, but manages to cram joke after joke in, alluding  to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not  limited to the STAR WARS films).\nThe filming, acting, and score is  superb.  My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough.  I also  feel like the script could have used a little more polish.  However, this  short film is a fun and diverting fantasy, adding another dimension of  folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its  much-revered creator.";High quality film short
15;6.0;5.0;16.0;1333;Props to the makers of this ingenious little movie.  To say anything is to give away all the gags, which are hilarious.  If you are a fan of Star Wars, there's really no reason not to love this short film.  My friend and  I about died laughing at some of the injokes.\nI guess my only complaint  would be that I wish it were longer, to satisfy my thirst for more of this  movie.;Brilliant!
16;9.0;3.0;14.0;1334;"A co-worker, a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, breathlessly brought this video to work and had me borrow it. ""It's so great!,"" he promised. Eh... My friends have made more effective nine minute movies, but  it's not hard to understand why this film sells so well -- there's an  endless supply of mythology for devotees of ""Star Wars,"" and this  movie exposes it, if not skillfully, at least blatantly. Few of the  so-called ""inspiration"" shots really work well -- Obi-Wan and  Jabba work because they're more subtle. The Darth Vader and R2D2/C3PO ones  stretch for believability -- I know there's weirdos at any university at  any time, but these caricatures try a little too hard as written (if what  I'm writing doesn't make sense, it's because I'm trying to not give the  movie away). Really good filmmakers (and remember that Nussbaum is still  new at this) don't pander in such obvious ways. Still, the acting's good,  it's reasonably well-made, and there's only nine minutes of it, so you  don't have too long to dwell on shortcomings anyway. Not a bad purchase for  ""Star Wars"" freaks.";It won't blow your mind.
17;10.0;1.0;14.0;1337;First of all, anyone who gave this movie a 5 needs their head examined.  It's only 9 minutes long.  I understand it's a short, but that's a little riduculous considering it costs $12 to get it from Amazon.  That's $1.25 a  minute, for a movie that isn't funnier than anything I could think of.  And  why does his girlfriend have that hairdo?  They don't explain.  So I  suggest, you don't buy.;Waste of Time?
18;3.0;5.0;39.0;1339;Several reviewers around here really seem to want a lot from a 9 minute film.\n'George Lucas In Love' was a very fun short. From Lucas' roommate Benji talking about an 'all powerful force' to his friends Hal & Chuck  working on Hal's 'fastest thing on campus' to a professor whose speech  patterns resembled a well known Jedi Master, this film has a heck of a lot  crammed into it's 9 minutes.  If anything, the filmmakers should have done  a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable. Maybe just a  tad bit funnier than 'Hardware Wars'.\nThe music, cinematography, and  acting are all very good, indeed.  Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a  little really needs to get a sense of humor.  Of course, it's a bit cheesy,  but it's meant to be that way.  It's presented in the slightly corny,  overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same  people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George  Lucas In Love'.  It's not a 'great' film, but who cares?  It's a fun little  short by a guy who really loves 'Star Wars'.  Some have condemned the  filmmakers doing this just for the money. I seriously doubt that Mr.  Nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does, big deal.  Nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at  all. Surely, none of the people who reviewed this film would go and work at  their jobs for free and live in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere!  Anyway, GLIL is great fun and a great to watch before your next screening  of 'Phantom Menace' or the original trilogy.;A very enjoyable 9 minutes..
19;28.0;5.0;5.0;1349;You don't have to be a genius to understand the magic behind this video. You get to see in a, parotical sense, the experiances that inspired the work of George Lucas. Believe it or not, it's hilarious. Calling this movie a waste of money just tells us how dense you are. This Video Rocks!  END;It's an Enjoyable Twist
20;13.0;1.0;11.0;1352;"This short film is the biggest waste of money since Arnold's End of Days.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, but, unlike Anakin Skywalker, this short has no chance of redemption.  All it consists of are unimaginative impressions of ""real life"" Stat Wars characters  like a black-clad asthmatic film school rival, and an earmuff-coiffed love  interest.  The flick is over before it begins, lacks any kind of  unpredictable climax, and can be summed up in one word: Dumb.";A 12-year-old could have made this:

23;11.0;5.0;14.0;1364;As far as comic shorts go, this one is a gem.  For those of you who find fault with story developement, originality, etc. (see other reviews here), I have this to say: it's a short film, not a feature film, and so by  defition it's not gonna give you what you can get in 120 minutes of screen  time.  But what Joe Nussbaum does in eight minutes puts to shame most of  the slop churned out in Hollywood.  It's probably harder to do something  good and funny in eight minutes than it is in a feature length film, and  this homage/spoof delivers the goods.  The details are dead on, the writing  is crisp and funny, the acting perfectly in tune with the spirit of the  project.  So everyone just relax and enjoy Lucas in Love for what it is.;It doesn't get much better

They manage to cram all that and so much  more into 9 minutes of hilarious movie.  I especially like the twist at the  end (and you'll have to watch the movie to find out what it is). :-)\nThis  is the story of George Lucas' inspiration for writing ""Star Wars""  a la Shakespeare in Love.\nThis video is great!  It's also nice to watch  it on video, since in the past (before I got the video) I watched it  online, and every time, I ran into net congestion.

I do feel, however, the part of the young man who was working  on the car was drastically understated.  His charisma, sex appeal, and  talent  should be used to its fullest.  I can see him as a young  Doctor/Doogie Howser or a rebel leading some sort of coup.  Any directors  out there need to cast more of this young man.  I have thoroughly enjoyed  this movie and will continue to recommend it to anyone who brings up Star  Wars and George Lucas.;"In Love with ""George Lucas In Love"""

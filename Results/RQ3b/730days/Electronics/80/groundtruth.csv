0;3.0;2.0;7.0;0;Had the player, a little funky to figure out but was working well. Works more like a hard drive than a music player, By that I mean it is not very Windows freindly. It has upgrades for the software, if you have a lot of music, the Moodlogic firmware upgrade is not a very good idea. The firward can really slow down the player.\n\nSound quality is good.\n\nWarranty is 1 year. My player died at 1 year, 2 weeks. Player was $299 when I bought it.\n\nIt took 7 calls, emails, and 1 fax from 9/27/05 until 11/08/05 to get a response, to my request to have it fixed.\n\nResponse: It is out of the 1 year warranty, there is nothing we will do for you.\n\n$300 annuanly for a player is a rip off\n\nBUY SOMETHING ELSE;The Battery Dies & You Are Screwed
1;19.0;4.0;6.0;53;"Pros: It plays many formats, including ogg. It's nice that it's a usable hard-drive, without requiring special software for the computer it connects to. The radio and recorder are great plusses. The interface is better than average, although still not great.\n\nCons: If it breaks and it's not under warrantee, there is no way to get it repaired. User interface could be better. The fast-forward is very slow, and there is no ""bookmark"" feature - together this makes the iRiver nearly unusable for long podcasts or audiobooks.\n\nSummary: A good choice, especially if radio, recorder, and ogg playing is required, and if you don't need to listen to audiobooks. Otherwise, consider the Rio Karma or iPod instead.";A great Mp3 player - but flawed
2;37.0;5.0;7.0;210;"Some people have been conditioned to think (by the media) that the Ipod is the ultimate jukebox-carry-along-music-whatever-device. WRONG!!!! I am of the opinion that the Ipod is highly overrated, so when I went looking for a hard drive player, I didn't even bother to check it.\n\nBut enough of the Ipod; this review is about the incredibly magnificent Iriver H120. The pros outweight the cons by a large and considerable margin: sound, user-friendliness, features, the gorgeously engraved leather carrying case, etc. I managed to equalize my Iriver so now it sounds the same, if not better, than a Bose sound system. The buttons only need 5 mins. to get accostumed to, and in the remote, everything is at your finger's reach, literally speaking.\n\nThe only problem I see with this device is the tangled cords between the remote and the earphones (which, by the way, are not that crappy as everybody says, once you equalize the sound to get the best out of them). Other than that, is the best spent US $250 ever.\n\nI recommend this player with my eyes closed; it has been the best Xmas gift I could have ever given myself.";My best purchase ever!!
3;38.0;5.0;8.0;280;I bought this baby almost 2 years ago after doing extensive research on all the mp3 players out there. I'm convinced that people only buy the ipod because it is the best advertized and, therefore, trendiest. However, the iRiver puts the ipod to shame. Not only is it an mp3 player, but it is also an external harddrive. That means you can hold any files you want on it. If you want to transfer 10 movies from one computer to another, just drag em onto the iRiver and it's that simple. For those of you who want to know about the recording function (that the ipod does NOT have), I just bootlegged a concert last week. I was in the middle of the audience and I just used the external microphone it comes with, and the recording came out great for an audience recording! I had to boost up the volume a bit with a wav editing program, but the sound quality was good and clear without any maxing out. And you can record it either wav or mp3 format. Besides that, the battery life is great. The size is basically identical to the ipod, except the ipod is all white and feminine, while the iRiver is black and cooler looking with a sick blue LCD screen. All in all, if you want the best price for the best player out there, get the iRiver.;The best mp3 player out there
4;49.0;3.0;7.0;297;"i bought this mp3 player for 3 reasons\n\n1. the voice recorder\n\n2. the built in radio/ gigage\n\n3. its something different (other than an ipod)\n\nthings that are wrong about this product\n\n1. the catagoization of the songs. an iriver is a drag and drop system with a DB scan that will enable you to browse through artist, album, ect. the only problem is if you don't have your mp3 files properly ID Tagged it won't even recognize it. (dont get scared they will still go on the mp3 player just it will be slightly harder to find which is a slight inconvience that is noticible) and even if your files are tagged sometimes the Iriver\n\nstill won't recognize it. that was frustrating, where as the ipod has a system through itunes i believe that is somewhat better.\n\n2. the voice recorder. it comes with an external mic and a built in mic. the problem is with the interal mic. about every 30 seconds the iriver will sahy, ""load"" or ""refresh"" and that produces a noise. so if you listen to your recorded work about every 30 seconds a distinct wizzing sound will appear. and that was extremely annoying.\n\n3. the button control is much more complex and at sometimes confusing. i applaud the ipod for staying simple.\n\n4. the remote gets in the way with its LONG cord. plus if it is a remote why does it have a cord at all??\n\n5. the earphones/carrying case is a piece of crap\n\n6. although i haven't timed it out i find hard to believe that the so called 16 hour battery life actually lasts 16 hours. don't get me wrong it lasts longer than my ipod. but not 16 hours.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED.\n\n1. its not an ipod\n\n2. the quality of the sound is DEFINATELY improved. much more than the ipod\n\n3. the radio works great!\n\n4. the radio/recorder combo if you want these in an ipod. you will have to pay extra $$\n\n4. so some of my songs that skipped the iriver elliminated it.\n\n5. its unique! if you buy this people will notice it and you can brag about it.\n\n6. tech support always answers my questions within 24 hours\n\nall in all i am pleased with this product\n\ni would recommed it if you are a man who is very familiar with technology. if you a clueless simple guy go with the ipod. i still like it more than the ipod because it does more for me.";its good but there ARE problems
5;42.0;5.0;8.0;337;"OK. There are only TWO units that support the line in WAV file\n\nrecording. The iRiver H-120 (or H-140) and the Creative Labs\n\nNomad Jukebox 3. I am not interested in the MP3 features\n\nof ANY of these devices. The new iRiver models, to replace the\n\nnow discontinued H-120 and H-140 do NOT allow optical line-in\n\nrecording, and do NOT allow UNCOMPRESSED AUDIO format (WAV).\n\nThis matters to me, and to some of you, I'm sure. I connect this\n\ndevice to the soundboard output of my band (or any band or any\n\nmusic I wish to record live)...It blows the old Mini-Disc I used\n\nout of the water!\n\nI wish they (iRiver H-120 / H-140) allowed WAV recording up to\n\n48 kHz (DVD or DAT audio quality) as opposed to limiting it to\n\n44.1 kHz (CD audio quality). The C.L Nomad JB3 allows up to\n\n48 kHz recording quality, and man does that sound nice!!!\n\nSo, if you want an ""MP3 player"", go buy one of the myriad\n\nlossy options (IPOD, Dell, Rio, etc..). If you are interested\n\nin live audio recording, to uncompressed audio format\n\n(IE, .WAV format at 44.1 or higher D/A sampling rate)\n\nthen your options are VERY limited.\n\nBetween iRiver and Creative Labs, I believe iRiver is a better\n\ncompany, and supports their product more honestly than Creative\n\nLabs. Creative Labs was offering ""refurbished"" JB3 units (20G\n\nor 40G hard drive) with only a 30 day warranty! The new units\n\nhad only 30 or 60 day warranty. Not a good sign....That product\n\nis now discontinued, and it seems no solid replacement has been\n\nplanned by Creative Labs.\n\nI have asked iRiver tech support about the inclusion of WAV\n\nformat, and optical input on their new models, have not\n\nreceived a reply yet. I will post their response when I get it!\n\nSo, I am getting an H-120 for Christmas, not sure if it's used\n\nor new. They are tough to find!\n\nCheck eBay, check Amazon.com, check Google ""Froogle"",\n\ncheck online mostly.\n\niRiver's online store says ""sold out"" and no more are expected!";Line in WAV recording - Uncompressed Audio - Live Recording
6;44.0;5.0;8.0;359;You can read all the reviews about the specs and technical stuff, but in my opinion the ONE thing that makes this player worth every single penny is the Optical Line Out... Grab a toslink cable and connect directly to your Optical line in to your receiver! The sound is incredible!  I no longer need to rummage thru my cd collection -- this is absolutely the best feature in my view and until other players include it, I'm sticking to my IHP!;The Optical Line Out makes this player!
7;23.0;5.0;12.0;365;"Alright, we have this little hard drive MP3 player market that seems to be getting a lot of attention these days, and lord knows the minute you utter ""MP3 player"", you'll be hearing iPod this and iPod that. Are there any other choices, or is it just useless to fight fate?\n\nI, for one, was lucky enough to stumble upon the H120 in my quest for answers. The bottom line here is if you're looking for a slick, sexy MP3 player as some sort of status symbol, the iPod should suffice. However, if you really care about the music you're going to put on your new gadget, the iRiver is your ticket.\n\nFirst up, I'd like to address the database difficulties. I, for one, don't see a problem, because the folder tree system works like a dream. Simply copy your CDs to appropriately prepared folders, and you're ready to roll. I have all my music arranged according to genre, with each artist occupying a sub-folder. This insures that even friends foreign to my music collection can easily find something they'll be into.\n\nThe number of file types supported by the player is staggering. OGG file support is a huge advantage over iPod, or you could copy your CDs with Windows Media player and transfer the WMAs to your player. What could be easier?\n\nFor a college student like myself, the recording feature works beautifully and is a huge boon. I record all my lectures for future studying (which is made even easier with the cool ""study"" playback feature), and the sound is crisp and clear.\n\nSound quality is absolutely staggering. Any self-respecting music lover should already have a decent pair of headphones, so toss out the ear buds and enjoy the H120 unchained. All the levels are customizable, and the volume is very good, with a 10 out of 40 working just fine in areas with little outside noise.\n\nIn terms of design, I have no qualms. I find the player to be quite sleek, and while the provided case does detract from its visual appeal, I'd rather keep the device well-protected. The joystick is sufficient for navigation, though not as intuitive as the iPod wheel.\n\nI have very few problems with this player, but if you let me nit-pick, then by God, I will. For one thing, the joystick can be a bit slippery, and it might have been smart to coat it in a substance that would provide more friction. On-the-fly deleting has since been taken care of in a firmware upgrade, but on-the-fly playlists are still missing (but seeing as how iRiver's announced this feature and has come through with their other promises, I have no worries). And, if you insist on navigating by tag, you may have the troubles of which others have complained.\n\nBut nit-picks aside, I just don't have time to get into the great 16 hour battery life, or touch on the handy FM radio, or boast of the excellent connectivity, as there simply too many wonderful features to scrutinize in one amazon review. All I can say is that the H120 is not only one of the few products that has meet all my expectations, but has even surpassed many of them. If you care about your music, this choice should be simple.";So, are you into style or substance?
8;62.0;1.0;6.0;373;I read reviews before I bought this, and many of them warned that customer service at iRiver was awful. I didn't listen, and I bought the unit. First one stopped operating after two days. I got it replaced, second one stopped working in less than 24 hours. I asked customer service for help, they refused to issue a refund. I finally contacted the BBB (other complaints against iRiver have been filed with the Silicon Valley BBB), my credit card company, and my state's attorney general. After a while, my credit card company got me a refund. This was not worth the hassle in any way. Please, don't make the same mistake and let the features entice you. Bad customer service and poor quality products will make you miserable.;Terrible Customer Service. Do not buy this!
9;54.0;2.0;7.0;379;iRiver is known for poor quality. Buttons break frequently. You will be happy for one year(sound quality is good) but, then the device will break. iRiver does NOT stand behind their product. They, apparently, depend upon breakage to generate new sales. Additionally, they sell at higher prices than their competitors - and give lower quality.\n\nLook at Consumer Reports November 2004 issue. It will be clear to you which products you should be considering.;Beware Long-term Durability
10;55.0;5.0;7.0;382;Ive had this player for about 6 months now. It is absolutely fantastic and holds up tremendously well. I got this because Im a commuter and I needed to occupy my downtime. I also have the availability to listen to music at work too. This player lasts all day long with hardly a dent in battery life. Transferring music from your hard drive to this player is easier than learning how to snap your fingers. And it plays everything! No proprietary software necessary or converting files to play. The best part is the built in radio. It works fantastically and its a pleasure to change up my music tastes from my own collection once in a while. Personally, the radio capabilities is its biggest sell for me. I love listening to morning radio talk shows and then my stuff in the afternoon. The included remote is awesome too. What other company includes a remote this good? You can control everything on it and never need to take the player out of your bag. It comes with its own case although I don't use it anymore. The plastic and metal is very strong and scratch resistant too as Ive inadvertantly tested it by mistake a couple times. The last thing I have to say is customer service for iRiver is top notch. I had a problem with the remote after a while of heavy usage and they sent me a new one, no questions asked. Everyone was so professional and polite. See if you could get that from Apple after youve taken the product home.;I still don't understand why people go for the ipod.
11;11.0;5.0;27.0;383;"Critique:\n\nI've had the unit for about a week. I have LOVED it the entire time. Unlike many people that have posted negative responses, I have done my research PRIOR to purchasing this item, especially considering the price; about $340 with taxes. Using my Pros/Cons as guidelines, I will give you my opinion on this great item.\n\nFirst, the File Transfer. People have suggested that it is slow. I don't understand this critique. It is USB 2.0, and without the faster Fire Wire transfer, I'm not sure what people are wanting?? I listen to Drum and Bass (DnB) (keep this in mind as this will be a recurring theme in my critique), many of the DnB files that I have added to the unit are 50, 60, 90, 200 Mb in size. They are live shows that are gathered using StreamRipper for WinAmp during the Live Show Broadcasts on various DnB websites. So the files are HUGE and they take no more time to transfer to the H120 unit than it would to write to CD-R or to transfer from one folder to another on the PC hard drive. Grouping many of these files together and then transferring them to the unit takes the time anyone with any computer savvy would expect a large file transfer to take. The database is supposed to need to be updated by going Start-> Explore -> then right click on the drive and select ""Update DB."" I had to do this the first time, but I did notice the 2nd go around I didn't have to do this, as it updated on its own. Also before, you weren't able to remove the files from the unit, but this has been remedied and it now works just like a regular PC HD and this alone is a MAJOR advantage over other players. Also, I don't have to add any silly proprietary software program to my PC. The LAST thing I need is to have space taken up on my computer by another program. Winamp, a FREE 4mb program can organize my playlists and functions quite nicely for assigning ID3 tags.\n\nFile capacity is massive. I know that this issue is dependent on requirements by the particular user. In my case (DnB, in addition to my CD and other MP3 collection) this 20Gb HD was a definite requirement.\n\nThe battery life of this unit is amazing. Many of the DnB shows that I listen to and Stream are 4 HOURS LONG!!! Meaning, in order to listen to the entire thing, I'd need time as well as battery life. I ride the train to and from work, so I am able to listen on the train, at work, and then on the way home again. The first day I owned the unit, I played it for AT LEAST 12 hours. I noticed that this is less than the stated 16-hour claim. I have discovered reasons for this: The MORE you play with the unit (changing tracks, adjusting audio, surfing etc.) the less battery life you'll get. Much like cell phones, keep them closed and use when necessary, the battery lasts a lot longer. I also discovered that the Backlight is a MAJOR battery drain. Fortunately, this can be turned OFF. I figure, I'm not listening to this in the dark for the most part, so I can see what's on the face of the unit, what do I need a backlight for? Other than for looks, it's pointless. I turn it off, in turn; the 2nd day of usage put me 14-15 hours. Also, the bit rates of the files have an impact. All of my MP3 files are 128 and above so this uses more battery power. Still 12 hours is NOTHING to frown upon.\n\nSince the reason I bought an mp3 player is for music, I needed one that would sound good. With the music I listen to, it was important to have lots of power to the headphones. The H120 delivers big time. Everything is crystal clear, and powerful and LOUD! The way I like it. The system offers an EXCELLENT EQ that really does change the sound of the music. It sounds great ""stock"" but the tweaks for your likings make it absolutely incredible. But, as nothing is perfect, there are a few quirky things to go over, to give a fair and balanced review.\n\nPeople have been complaining about the ""joy stick"" more than anything else. It really isn't all that bad of an idea. It takes a bit of getting used to but once you get it down, it's easy as anything else. Holding it down will get you to the settings menu for sound adjustments and the like. It's about practice with the ""joy stick"" and once you learn the navigation technique it will be fine. Also, the SCROLL SPEED is FINE. Sure, it's not a touch pad and doesn't go flying through the tracks, but can people even read that fast anyway? Furthermore, most of the time, you go PAST the track you want and have to backtrack to the proper selection (when using a touch pad) and the time it takes to do all of that, the H120 has it already selected via it's method. What I don't like is that it sticks up a bit and so when you try to remove it from the carrying case, it gets caught. Not cool, since it isn't exactly made of billet aluminum. So, it's more of a nuisance than a fault.\n\nThe unit comes with a remote; a remote that I used ONE TIME and was appalled by it. Yes, due to the size of the H120 the remote with the clothes clip would really come in handy. Except for one MAJOR detail: YOU LOSE HEADPHONE POWER. You have to plug your headphones into the remote unit, and it has about 60% of the power of the base unit. Trust me; I went back and forth a ton of times with the same part of the DnB song to verify this. There is NO WAY that I can use this unit because it detracts from the most important part of the music... the quality.\n\nIt is a little large, that's all I can say about that. But I was aware of that going in, so that really isn't a critique, more of a restatement of a known fact.\n\nThe ear buds supplied are WORTHLESS. ALL ear buds are worthless, for that matter. There is NO NEED for ear buds, unless you're working out or running and thus rendering regular headphone useless. Again, back to my DnB, it has TONS of bass, which is the point of this music genre.\n\nEar buds: Scarcely even have a tweeter, let alone anything that could be considered a ""woofer."" So there is NO SUBSTANCE in the ear buds and I find it quite hard to believe that any person that enjoys music would use ear buds, no matter which mp3 player you choose. They are uncomfortable despite the padding. The last thing I need is an oversized Q-Tip that plays music. So, people should deep six the ear buds and spring for a set of decent headphones. I have a $45 set of Sennheiser HD 457. Let me tell you *(and I know this isn't a critique for the headphones, but it applies), save for the vibration, and sheer volume of my car stereo speakers, these headphones pump some serious bass. Bass that you can hear AND feel! So, I lose nothing when listening to my DnB. Point is, don't complain about the supplied ear bud, go buy something that was MADE for music. Using ear buds is like trying to listen to music from your cell phone ear piece speaker. I'm SURE they're using the exact same technology, not designed for music as much as just for ""sound.""\n\nThe unit costs $300 or more. You can get it for cheaper, but factoring in any shipping costs, you're in the same boat. Is this a complaint? Yes and no. Yes because we all would like such nice items and not have to pay so much for them. However, no, because I could've just as easily spent $199 for a RIO 512mb unit or $249 for a 4mb iPod Mini, just slightly less cost wise than my unit, but WAY less in terms of storage and functionality which is the purpose of this player.\n\nOn a final note, people that have bought this unit and in turn, have spouted off asinine complaints and comparisons to iPod are clueless in every sense of the word. The reason is simple: They did NOT buy an mp3 player for music, they bought it as a status symbol or because it is socially popular right now. I mean read their complaints: ""Not as sexy"", ""the iPod is just SO much prettier!"" ""Ugly looking"", and ""iPod SOFTWARE is better than Windows Drag and Drop""??? You're kidding right? How HARD is it to drag and drop? Even 90 year olds with NO PC savvy are able to drag and drop. It just goes to show the focus of the people that are obsessed with this iPod craze. I am attempting to steer clear of criticizing the iPod crowd, but let's be frank. iPod is for the McIntosh/Apple crowd. It is the same crowd that drives Saabs and ties sweaters around their necks.\n\nAll in all, this is a FANTASTIC player and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to have an mp3 player that is priced in the same range as the rest, offers awesome power to the headphones, stores lots of music and plays on and on and on!\n\nThank you.";Do NOT pass this up
12;63.0;4.0;6.0;384;We can read a 100 reviews on the quality of the player.  This review is for people like me who have an iriver that may not always work as well as it did the day they got it.\n\nI bought my iriver in January and by June the battery life was a measly 2-3 hours at best.  Also, the unit would not work at all when it was plugged into my wall or the car adaptor I had purchased from iriver.com.  So why four stars?  Taking the advice of another amazon.com reviewer, I blew off the dust that had been collecting on my ihp and wrote iriver an email, then two days later I got a response and within a week I was shipping my unit back to iriver.  I never even had my ihp registered, so don't let that stop you.\n\nYesterday I recieved my brand new unit, accessories and all.  I have a sneaking suspicion that iriver has a whole warehouse full of ihp120's now that they have their new unit out.  Also, I have seen the ihp for as little as $175 at a major retailer.  Even so, I'm sticking with my iriver and am planning on downloading irivium, which seems like it will make it an entirely new machine.\n\nOverall I am very impressed with the customer service and very excited about getting my new iriver and giving it another chance.;impressive customer service
13;64.0;5.0;6.0;389;"Ok, first let's get this straight: look NO MORE for options.  This is the one you need, or maybe the 40 GB version.  But it's iRiver the right choice.\n\nThe great things about this product are: excellent quality of audio, extremely great battery life (about 16 hours), it has a FM radio that works really well, it appears as an external hard disk drive in your computer (you don't need any software to install, just drag n' drop music files into it), it's software upgradeable, handles WinAmp playlists and it plays OGG, MP3, WMA! Also it comes with a really cool leather case.\n\nA feature that I really like is the Line Out feature.  It has dual output: analog and digital output.  And since it's used as an external hard drive, I use it to transfer any data file to one computer to another, it's a removable HDD!  iRiver H120 also has a database feature if you want to browse your music through the artists, albums, titles, genres, etc.  (I personally don't use it, I like the files and directories browsing).\n\nBut of course it has some flaws:  right now with firmware ""1.60 US"" the shuffle is not ""that"" random and some people complain about the gap between songs (1 or 2 seconds gap between songs).  I don't really care about the gap but there are some people out there that listen to live albums and hate it with a passion.  I listen to live albums too but to me it's not that bad. Those are the only flaws I have found in about 2 months.\n\nAnyway iRiver agreed to solve these problems (BOTH: gap and randomness) in a future firmware release, nothing to be worried about for too long.  People will get their bugs fixed in no time.  I registered my product in iRiver site and I sent an email about these bugs, they answered it the same day.  If you register your product you'll see iRiver's support is just great.\n\nDon't worry: iPod has its flaws too, go read the reviews.\n\nThe only thing I would suggest if you get this product and want the best of it is to get good headphones.  I got some Isolating Sound headphones (kinda expensive) and I know I can't get a better sound than the one I'm getting now with my iRiver H120.  The iRiver headphones are ok but I hated the short cable (the remote has a long cable but I like to put my remote in a belt strip).\n\nWhy would you choose an iPod instead of this one? I haven't find an answer yet.  iRiver is not only way cheaper than the iPod: it's BETTER.

15;66.0;5.0;6.0;420;I purchased my unit in July of this year (04) and love this thing.  I use the file tree method rather than the database method for locating/playing my files.  I have structured my files by genre, album, artist and it works well for me.  It is easy to locate my songs.  I am a daily walker and set my player to shuffle the entire hard disk.  I am amazed at how well this works.  It is like having a new album(s) every day.  If I want to play any particular album/artis I can do so easily.  I will not bore you with all the details but I must dispell the myth that iRiver's customer service doesn't exist.  I had problems with the battery in my unit, it would last only 4-5 hours.  I called their support line and in turn advised me to send them an email describing the problem.  This email would be re-directed to their return department that would immediately get back to me with an RMA number and instructions for returning the defective unit.  The next day I received the email.  I returned the player on a Thursday and I was literally amazed that I received a brand new player in it's sealed plastic case with all the accessories on the following Monday via UPS.  I live in the Bay Area and the return location is also in the Bay Area so this is much faster than had I lived on the East Coast.  However, what it did tell me is that the unit was packaged and mailed within 1-2 days from date the unit was received.  I did not have to send them the accessories, only the player.  They may be slow in updating their firmware but the service I got was outstanding.  Please do not believe everything you hear about their customer service department (800 number).  Hope this helps.;Great player, great customer service
16;36.0;5.0;10.0;421;I have owned my iHP-120 (same as the H120, just a different name) for a little over 6 months now.  I just upgraded the firmware last night to version 1.60 which gave me the ability to speed up/slow down .mp3s which will work great for some of my audio books (haven't tested it yet).  It also gave me gapless playback, something I am currently testing out, I haven't listened to a live album since turning this setting on so I cannot comment.  It gave me other stuff that I have little interest in as well.\n\nI bought this unit after considering the competition (there were two other competitors who I now forget and it isn't really important at this point).\n\nI would really like to have an iPod because of the Database functionality (helps to organize/rate your music).  I also like the styling and the ease of use of the iPod.\n\nThis jukebox does it all, however, effectively blowing away all others.  It has a built in FM tuner (important for me because I use this on my Motorcycle and like to get local news/events/weather where I go).\n\nIt has an included remote (important for me because of my motorcycle, the remote unit clips on nicely to my tankbag and has a long enough cord to hide the actual unit).\n\nIt has a surprisingly nice leather carrying case.  From experience, I have found that the leather carrying case helps protect the unit when dropped on the pavement from a height of about 4' (about the height of the tank bag on my motorcycle).  The carrying case really helps to keep the unit clean and scratch free (I am anal about that).\n\nThe sound is outstanding.  I am using a cheap pair of Sony (MDR-G52) headphones and they sound great.  I've used this with a pair of the latest generation Bose Noise-Canceling headphones and the sound was incredible.\n\nThe level of detail that is displayed on the playing song is very good, if you follow the Window's Media folder structure, you will be able to identify your songs quite well (if you use .wma's like I do).\n\nThis unit acts as a mass storage device when connected via USB to your PC (very nice).\n\nBasic operation is adequate and somewhat intuitive.  The unit has a lot of functionality that I just haven't used.  Unfortunately some of that functionality involves those two really cool optical ports (one reason for buying this unit).  I had dreams of connecting this to my home stereo, something I have yet to do. . .\n\nOne thing that I was real upset about was the database functionality.  During my research I didn't uncover the fact that the database only pulls ID tags from .mp3 files only.  If you use .wma (like me) you are out of luck and have to rely on your folder structure (which isn't all that bad after all).  The latest firmware added .ogg Vorbis tags to the list which doesnt help me as I don't use that format.\n\nIve used this mainly for music, however, on a few long trips I have used this for audiobooks.  The 16 hour battery life really helps on long flights/layovers/etc.  If all you are doing is listening to one audiobook, you're fine.  Shut the unit off and when you start it back up it will pick up where you left off.  If you want to listen to some music in the middle of an audiobook, you have to remember where you left off (wait for the end of a chapter) so you can get back to it.  The addition of bookmark capabilities would be very helpful.\n\nIf you have a LOT of music, make sure you are certain 20GB is enough.  I have about 30GB of music which means I have to prune 33% of my music to fit on this.  That is NOT an easy task if you are eclectic like me (you simply have to have it all).  For that reason, this unit will be going on eBay some time soon and I will be purchasing the 40GB model (either the H140 or the H340).  I like the extra space for more music\n\nFirmware updates are few and far between, release dates slipping by months at a time.  If you buy this make sure you buy it for the capabilities it has and not for something you think will be added in the future (bookmarks, etc).\n\nAll in all, this is well worth the money.  I am happy with my purchase and am planning on upgrading soon.;Wish I had one when I was a teenager. . .
17;74.0;5.0;5.0;429;I recently purchased an iHP-120 after researching many different types and brands of MP3 players/recorders on the market. It isn't too often when a product exceeds your expectations and it's advertised claims -- this one does. The build quality of the unit is very high, it comes with a generous assortment of accessories, the OS is well thought-out and easy to use, the feature set is exhaustive, the battery life is impressive, the OS is upgradeable via flash ROM, it supports multiple codecs, and the sound quality is awesome. I've been using the unit daily for the past week, and I have no criticisms to speak of. Although it may place a close second in comparison to an iPod for industrial design, I think that this baby is the best of it's kind on the market -- period -- in terms of it's design and function as a high capacity MP3 jukebox. You won't be disappointed.;Intelligently designed, high build quality, awesome sound.
18;43.0;5.0;9.0;430;"After about a month of endless research online (on CNet and the reviews here at Amazon) I decided on the iHP-120 for my new mp3 hard drive. I had previously owned a Dell DJ (which I found to be utterly and completely useless junk), and what drew me were all the features, the reliability, and the great sound. Well, I have tried 3 of the most popular mp3 players on the market now (the Dell, the Apple iPod, and now the iRiver) and let me just say that the sound is better on the iRiver than any other player available. The detail that came through even through the bad included ear-buds (I have a pair of Philips but will be upgrading to Grado SR-60's) was astounding--I had no idea such a complex and sophisticated sound could come out of a portable mp3 player, especially one so small (the player is tiny--the same size as the 4th gen iPod, but a little thicker). The included case gets the job done, although I will be upgrading to the Vaja leather case, or the iSkin when it is released. Another amazing feature is the connectivity/transferring of songs. The USB 2.0 is a joy, especially when coupled with the freedom to use Windows Explorer instead of MusicMatch or that piece of flaming s*** iTunes. But, if you're the sort of person who needs more guidance in the form of software, RedChair has made a download called IRivium Explorer that should do the trick. Also, the remote is good as well. It's much much much smaller than i expected (about the size of your thumb) and it's really handy, except for the cord, which is too long, and has the tendency to get tangled with the cord of your headphones. The equalizers that can be set up on the iHP-120 are amazing, too, and the volume that the player can go to without distorting the sound is very impressive. The FM tuner works great--no static, and the internal mic also fulfills my needs. The layout takes some getting used to, and, if you haven't already done this and your collection is small, I would recommend converting your files to mp3 format--the database function is a joy (although the recent firmware upgrade may support ogg/wma database files, i'm not sure). The controls aren't impossible to learn, though, and once you do, they make sense. Also, the player just looks great. It has a big screen and a very shiny black surface that feels as if it cost much more than it actually did. In my opinion, it looks much better than the Dell or the Rio Karma, and just as good as(if not better than) the iPod and the new Creative Zen Touch. I haven't found the joystick button to be a problem--on the contrary, I think it's a cool and unique feature. I have only 2 bones to pick with this player: the playlist feature and the shuffle feature. I'm sure you've read this before, but the shuffle isn't really shuffle (it plays the tracks in the same ""random"" order each time) and you can't create playlists in the field (you have to use winamp or IRivium, which I haven't tried yet), but these are minor gripes considering iRiver has promised to fix these in firmware upgrades--it can't be long now. But overall, I think this player has everything you could want in a portable digital audio device--room for 5000 mp3 songs, great features, and great sound, all packed into a very attractive package. So forget the repulsive and oppressive iPod franchise and say hello to iRiver!";Definitely THE BEST hard-drive player on the market
19;16.0;5.0;18.0;448;There are more than enough reviews raving about this MP3 player, and I have to agree with all of them.  This is a great hard drive player with an incredibly simple interface.  A few things to consider though:\n\n1) iRiver advertises this player as playing wma files and yet many user-written reviews say that they don't.  I was really confused by this until I bought it and realized that for some reason, it plays some wma songs, but not all.  I have no idea why, but that's how it seems to work.  So if you plan on copying CDs thru Windows Media Player, it would also be wise to get file conversion software if you don't already have it.  Once converted to mp3 files, you should have no other problems.\n\n2) If you've read enough iRiver reviews, you've probably seen a lot of gripes about their customer support.  As an owner of an iRiver CD player that fell on the floor and broke (it worked wonderfully before that...), I can tell you that their customer service really is useless unless you register your product.  I emailed them at the regular support@iriveramerica email address before registering my products 2 weeks ago and still have not gotten a response.  After reading from others that they don't respond to emails, I registered my product and sent them my question from my new account with them.  It was answered in about 2 business days.  That seems to be the easiest way to get your questions answered.\n\n3) iRiver, as I found out from the previous experience, does not carry parts or do repairs.  For defects covered by warantee, they replace the item.  If it's broken though, they offer no services.  So if you're the type of person who constantly and inadvertantly breaks things, this might not be the company for you.\n\nHope this has been helpful, and like I said, I would highly recommend this product.;Tech Comments
20;26.0;5.0;13.0;449;I'll admit it, the iHp-120 wasn't the first HDD player I bought...I opted instead for the Rio Karma - and don't get me wrong, it's a solid little player, but when compared to the iRiver, it's easily trumped in terms of features and durability.  Anyway, I have no regrets whatsoever about exchanging it for this fantastic piece of equipment.  Mp3 player, AM/FM tuner, portable USB hard drive, e-reader, personal recorder, you name it, this baby can do it, and do it better than any other player on the market.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- FOOLPROOF.  With all the features you'd think it would be difficult to use the thing...however, that's the furthest thing from the truth.\n\n- PLUG'N'PLAY.  No software needed! Just drag & drop. 'Nuff said.  However, adding the database function can be useful.  Also, all that extra space can be put to good use holding files you don't want cluttering up your hard drive on your PC.\n\n- WHOA DAMN!  Customize the sound to your liking, this thing sounds awesome...but the SRS and WOW EQ effects sound horrible and are useless in my opinion.\n\n- BLING BLING...everything you could ask for and a whole lot more...including an in-line remote (the best of the bunch), line-in cable, adapter, case, & external mic.\n\n- SAY WHAT?  Record music or voice from almost anywhere! Just use the mic or plug the unit into a headphone jack or optical out!\n\n- JUICE IT UP.  Battery life is pretty close to what iRiver claims, and among the best in its class.\n\n- TOO MANY TO LIST...\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The player uses Winamp (*.m3u) playlists, which is great, but lacks the tools to create or edit a playlist on-the-fly.  A minor gripe.\n\n- You need to connect to a PC to edit or delete any content.  Again, minor.\n\n- Joystick works well for navigation but it's a bit slippery.\n\n- The included earbuds actually sound pretty decent with good bass response, but they are too large and don't fit well.  And besides, they're grey and don't match the player at all!  I'd recommend the Sony MDR-EX71SL's.  Not only do they sound awesome, they have a shortened cord for use with the remote, they're dirt cheap when compared to high-end models like Grado and Shure...and they complement the iHP-120 perfectly!\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe worst thing about the iHP-120 is that it looks too damn good! I'm always wiping my fingerprints off the chrome, lol!\n\nThe Bottom line:\n\nIf you're looking for a HDD player then look no further, unless you're a conformist or if supporting Apple is some weird political trip for you.  iRiver all the way!;iPod?  Are you nuts?
21;17.0;5.0;18.0;454;"About six months ago I bought an ihp-120 after a lot of research. While I consider the reviewers from the online publications a useful resouurce, I put far more store in the opinions of actual users.  After looking around, I narrowed down my decision to the iRiver, the Ipod and the Rio Karma.\n\nI decided against the ubiquitous Ipod because of the relatively poor battery life and lack of functionality when compared to the IRiver. The Rio Karma was very interesting but there were so many negative comments about it's reliability and supposedly poor customer support that I thought it was too much of a risk. The decision was therefore straightforward. The iRiver is easily the most feature rich MP3 player out there with a 20gb hard drive, over 16 real hours of battery life, compact size, very solidly built, remote control, FM radio, voice recorder and, it is most importantly, highly reliable. The only small downside was that the included DB software was quirky in that it didn't accept long track names; this was alleviated by manually truncating the titles.\n\nA month ago I did someting really stupid and left my ihp-120 on a plane. In looking for a replacement I looked to see whether any advancements had taken place in this space. I took another look at the players I previously considered but the only change was that the Ipod had slightly better battery life but no additional functionality. I also looked at the Zen Touch which looks very sleek and has good battery life but, again looking at user reviews - there are already reports of it freezing up and there are numerous comments about the historical lack of support from Creative Labs.\n\nSo, with very little persuading I bought my second ihp-120 and, in addition to all the above benefits, I found that there is new Mood Logic software on the iRiver website which does away with the truncating issue!\n\nIf you look around, you will see, as ""cynic1"" has mentioned, that this is just an excellent player which is head and shoulders above the rest of the competition.";Do your research, there is no better player available
22;20.0;5.0;16.0;455;"I own this player for probably over half a year. I defiantly recommend this over the Ipod, and that includes the forth generation Ipod, and their mini Ipod. There's much more feature in this player then the Ipod, and from hardware to interface, you'll get more then what you'll pay for if you're deciding between this and any Ipods. For all the time that I had this player, it never fail me, expect when I shook it. With 20 GB of space you will never run out of room for storing music, I can duplicate all my music, and will still have enough room left over for installing Windows, not that I would recommend it though. One of the many features that this player has that Ipod lacks is the ability to record your voice and a FM tuner, may not be much use but who knows. You can also read text file from this player with the clear display. The interface is easy to use and has all the details. There's also other features that enhances sound quality, and I did notice a big different when it was turned on. It comes with a remote that can access all the features without taking out the player, even though I never use it, because I don't really mind taking out the player, and I memorized the keys on the player. It also comes with a case that I find really useful, since my player is kept in there 95% of the time; in fact I'm more use to seeing the case then the player. The only time I take it out of the case is when I want to look at it. All buttons can be access when it's inside the case, and I don't find it bulk when it's inside the case. The battery is out standing; I only charge it once every week if I need to, and charging the unit is extremely quick. Transferring files from computer to player is also very fast thanks to USB 2.0. This player can double as a backup drive, and no driver is needed for most Windows, just like a USB flash drive. This is rarely the only thing that I own that I have absolutely no problem with. The only thing Ipod has over this player is the looks, other then that I strongly recommend this player over all other players that's currently out there, buy it and you won't be disappointed.";Owned for over half a year
23;69.0;4.0;6.0;455;"I never really considered the iPod because it didn't have as many features as some of the other ones.  I very nearly went with the Nomad but I was scared off by the reports that it breaks so easily.\n\nAfter purchusing this mp3 player, I would say that I am fairly happy with it.\n\nPros:  Good amt. of storage space, easy to charge, easy to navigate, easy to organize, good sound quality, great quantity of options, tracks do not skip, device does not break after being dropped several times\n\nCons:  You have to play the playlists in alphabetical order, you can't delete tracks without being hooked up to a computer, you can't create playlists without being hooked up to a computer.  Also, this is probably the fault of the CD ripper I downloaded, but in case it isn't I'll include it here: the last few seconds of the songs are cut off.  I'm not sure if that's true for every song, but I sure notice it for tracks that ""lead into"" one another\n\nOther comments:  Why do you need the remote control if you have to plug it in for it to work?  Maybe I got the wrong idea.  LOL.  Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of a REMOTE control?  Oh well.  The size is fine too.  Some people say it's a little bulky, but you can still fit it in your pocket.\n\nOverall, it sure beats the other players that have such high price tags!  Very cool.";Great!
24;18.0;4.0;18.0;458;"Since Amazon won't let me update my previous review of the iHP-140, I'll list it under the iHP-120\n\nFurther evaluation of the iRiver iHP-140\n\nFour months ago, (in April) I posted a review of iRiver's iHP-140 MP3 jukebox on Amazon.  Since then, I have received many emails and questions about this great device.  If this review is still on line, I would urge you to read it as a preface to this review.\n\nThree weeks after mailing the email letter (sent to support@iriveramerica.com), and after sending it again recently (2004 August), I have not received an acknowledgment of the inquiry, let alone hope of pending solutions to the issues which I have discovered with the iHP-140.\n\nUnlike other companies, iRiver lists no phone number or mailing address, either on their website or the user manual.\n\nTherefore, I am hoping that readers who notice the same problems with this device will send email to support@iriveramerica.com to ask for support and solutions.\n\nMy evaluation of the iHP-140 may be summarized as follows\n\nHardware  Awesome!  Robust, compact and very capable.  Not only is it a nice toy, but a 40 GB HD which connects to your computer by USB, encodes analog audio to MP3 and has a quick-charging, long-lasting battery built in.\n\nFirmware  Needs improvement!  The issues are described below.\n\nSupport  Poor!\n\nDear sirs,\n\nIn April, I purchased the iRiver iHP-140. Since then, I have recorded over 300 hours of microphone and line-in sound, and have done USB data transfer, becoming acutely aware of its strengths and weaknesses. Each is a separate issue and they should be assessed by your technical management and addressed separately, and hopefully improved with a firmware upgrade.\n\nMy background It might be helpful for you to be aware of my extensive experience in sound recording. During the `60s, I did considerable recording using reel-to-reel tape, in both stereo and 4-track. When sound quality became adequate in the `70s, I switched to cassette tape, recording in stereo including Dolby NR technology. In the late `90s, my medium for recording sound became the Minidisc with Atrac compression, using the Sony MZ-R50 recorder. This device failed recently, and after extensive research, I decided to purchase the iRiver. I wrote an evaluation of this recorder for Amazon (which is apparently still posted) and have received and replied to numerous email questions about the iHP-140, based upon my (not completely satisfactory) experience. This puts me in a rather awkward position of being both a critic and supporter of your product.\n\nProgramming issues\n\nMP3 compression The algorithm used for MP3 compression is defective. Below 128 kbps at 44KHz sample rate, the sound quality is damaged by artifacts which sound like phasor-flanger effects, becoming worse as the bit rate lowers. Using computer WAV to MP3 conversion, I have extensively used 80 kbps satisfactorily, but the sound quality is not acceptable at that rate using the iHP-140, and is much worse at lower rates. The artifacts include frequencies which are NOT part of the original sound. This must be corrected!\n\nRecord pause indication As programmed, the iHP-140 indicates ""pause"" by flashing the tiny ""elapsed time"" figure. This is difficult to see under low-light conditions. It would make a lot more sense to flash the large RECORD indicator.\n\nRecord file-name indication When placed in record mode, before recording begins, no file name is shown. Because the recorder was built without any time-date indicator, I must write this information down, in order to maintain the dates of my recordings, and do not have the file name information available unless I hit the record/pause twice. This change should be exceedingly easy to implement. (It would certainly not matter if the track of that filename was not used)\n\n[From information available to me prior to purchasing this unit, I did not recognize that it did NOT have an internal clock (as my computer, digital camera, cell phone, camcorder and MD recorder contain). The reasons for this are understandable, as iRiver did not choose to add the small amount of extra hardware to implement an internal clock, and felt the extra power consumed by it merited this decision. This was certainly the WRONG decision for my purposes, and I would not have purchased this unit if I have realized this omission.]\n\nPlayback error If the unit's function, using the record button, is changed directly from RECORD to PLAYBACK, after playing for a few minutes, occasionally the track being played will skip to the next track or just stop, even though the current track has no record errors. If the recorder is powered down and restarted, the track will play correctly.  Bug!\n\nBacklighting of display It was good design to allow the duration of display backlighting to be selected by the user, but when the unit is first powered up, the display backlighting duration is fixed, shutting off just a moment before the Record Setup screen appears, making it difficult to ascertain when the record button may be pressed to begin recording in conditions of low lighting.\n\nPlayback fast-forwarding Many of my recordings are over an hour in length, and the fastest rate available is much too slow to get to the middle of that recording session in a reasonable time. This is a tough one. I cannot suggest how to make this function manageable.\n\nVolume control I discovered that the volume control affects not only the headphone output but also the line output. On all other audio devices I have used, ""line out"" has a standard level, unaffected by any volume controls. Somebody in your design team seems to have missed this.\n\nFlow chart in the user manual would be useful It would be easy for an engineer (and useful for engineer users like me) to present the functions of the iHP-140 with a flowchart, showing which function results from which button pushes. I could suggest one, but would not offer this effort without a guarantee of compensation.\n\nIn summary The hardware of the iHP-140 is excellent, but it should have been user-tested more completely before releasing it to the public for sale. One reason I chose this unit for purchase is that the firmware is upgradeable. Please consider my suggestions for your first available upgrade and notify me by email when improvements are available.\n\n[ drchick@mindspring.com ]\n\nChick Hebert\n\nThe Media Guy";Update of the iRiver iHP-140 MP3 jukebox
25;10.0;4.0;35.0;462;"After buying an Apple iPod and trying it for a few weeks, I returned it and purchased an iRiver iHP-120 instead. Below is my comparison:\n\n Advantages to the iRiver iHP-120 over the iPod:\n\n The iRiver's battery lasts twice as long as the iPod (16 hours instead of 8 hours).\n\n While I haven't actually held one in each hand to compare, according to the on-line specs, the iRiver is a few grams lighter (weight) than the iPod, in spite of it's slightly larger casing.\n\n The buttons are more tactile and resistant. A problem with the iPod was that the buttons on the unit itself (not the remote) were so incredibly feather-touch sensitive, that unless I kept re-engaging the hold switch, I would accidently press buttons all the time just while holding it!\n\n The iRiver has a much better remote. All the iPod's remote had was a play/pause button, and FWD and REV buttons. The iRiver's remote, while slightly larger, has full-functionality (you can actually get away with NEVER using the buttons on the main unit), and also has a backlighted LCD screen which shows almost all the info you would need while listening and navigating your music library. In addition, the iRiver's remote has a much better clip for attaching it to your belt, shirt pocket, etc.\n\n The iRiver's carrying case is better. It has a clear-plastic window exposing the screen, and perfectly placed holes for all buttons and ports. Unlike the iPod, you never actually need to remove the iRiver from it's case if you don't want! Not even to charge or connect to PC.\n\n With the iRiver, you can choose to either browse your music library by file tree, or by artist/album/genre (MP3).\n\n The iRiver can record (right out of the box, not with an optional accessory!). In addition to the built-in mic for voice recoring, the package includes an external mic (with lapel clip). The unit also has analog/optical ports for line in/out.\n\n The iRiver has a built-in FM radio with support for 20 preset stations (unfortunately you can't record from the radio).\n\n One thing that bugged me about the iPod was that if the title of the song was long, only some of it would be shown on the screen. The name would just be truncated and you could never see the rest. The iRiver on the other hand, has a nice feature where if the title of the song is longer than the width of the screen, it will scroll over so show the rest. And on top of that, you can configure the speed at which it scrolls, and how it scrolls to the next ""screen"" of text (vertically, horizontally). I don't know why Apple didn't think of that. Mind you, things like that could always be fixed in a future firmware update...\n\n The iRiver is shipped with everything you need. Including an AC adaptor, USB 2.0 cable, carrying case, headphones, external mic, remote, etc. There is no cradle, but then again you don't need to use the same cable for power/data as you do with the iPod. When I had the iPod I had to buy a USB 2.0/Firewire combo cable so that I didn't have to keep unplugging the firewire from the computer every time I wanted to charge the unit. The iRiver comes with an AC adaptor, and a USB 2.0 cable (which is faster than firewire anyway-- I filled my entire 20GB iRiver in less than 40 minutes).\n\n The iRiver, in my opinion, has better sound. When I had my iPod I found that if I had any of the EQ effects turned on, many of my songs would be distorted. The iRiver doesn't have that problem, and also, unlike the iPod, the iRiver has a user-configurable EQ setting as well as the presets, not to mention SRS surround sound and WOW effects. Balance, treble/bass.\n\n The iRiver can be used as a portable HD simply by connecting it to a PC (shows up as a new drive letter). Even though the Apple iPod can do this too, the difference is that with the iRiver, you can copy your music files back to a PC again. The iPod did not allow this, unless you chose NOT to have the music files available for listening on the iPod.\n\n ---\n\n Below are the things that I liked better about the Apple iPod. Although some are great features, I ultimately think that the iRiver is a better unit:\n\n The circular scroll wheel on the iPod is extremely innovative. It allows you to scroll as slowly or as quickly through large lists of songs (or scan forward/backward within a song) as you want, and be as accurate as you want with the scrolling. Although the iRiver has a nice joystick-type controller, and you can scroll quite fast, it isn't as useful as the iPod's scroll wheel.\n\n The iPod is *slightly* thinner. While both the iPod and the iRiver are identical in length and width, the iPod is a tiny bit thinner.\n\n The iPod boots up instantly. No wait time at all. Unfortunately, the iRiver takes about 10 seconds to boot up if you choose to browse your library by file tree, or about 30 seconds if you want to browse by artist/album/genre.\n\n While listening, you can create an on-the-go playlist, queueing up as many songs as you want. Then save it to your computer later. The iRiver, by comparison, can only queue up one song (the next song) to play after the current one ends. With the iRiver, you can still create playlists, but must do it on your computer using Winamp (not included).\n\n There's my opinion!";Comparison of the iRiver/iPod
26;30.0;2.0;13.0;469;I own an older PC and thought the iriver would be the choice for me.  I should have gotten the ipod.  First off, there is no information saying that the player will not support protected content.  So all the music I copied onto my computer is useless and would not play.  So after a few days of copying cds, unprotected, I was able to play them on my iriver.  BUT, since the files were .wma format, the player would not recognize them.  So if I tried to search for a song by title or artist, it was not there.\n\nI had to download winamp to make playlists which in itself is no big deal, but since most of my music was in .wma format, those songs would not be on the playlist.\n\nCustomer service is a joke!  I emailed the company twice asking for help, and did not get a response even after a week.  I called and was on hold for 15 minutes before someone came on and said there was not a whole lot I could do.\n\nI thought this product was going to make listening to music easy for me.  It turned out that over half the music on my computer would not play on the iHP120.\n\nI returned it and am buying the new ipod.;buy the ipod

I hesitate to call it an MP3 player (although of course it is) because my files are .wma format . . anyway - I'm somewhat new to this technology . . so when the time came to buy either an Ipod or something similar I made sure I did a LOT of research.\n\n I ordered the iRiver iHP-120 at the end of June 2004. I received it within 2 days from Amazon. I used it for 2 days. I treated it like it were an egg. Super careful. Didn't drop or bang it. I'm acutely aware of hard drives and how delicate (don't care what folks tell you to the contrary) they are. After 2 days it abruptly stopped playing ......and (I was sitting completely still at my computer reading a file) then displayed a ""checking drive"" message --- THEN (this is the part I am quite sure the iRiver customer svs guy just simply didn't believe) it entered ""recording"" mode and then froze up like it was recording and then had paused. I was floored. All this time I was just sitting at my PC looking at the display on the remote. At that point, I picked it up and tried to turn it off. It finally powered down. I let it rest for about 10 minutes. . . then tried to turn it back on - it powered up -- and then down all within a 30-45 second period of time. My review star rating lost 1 star for the iRiver being defective. The 2nd star was lost due to the ""customer service"" iRiver apparently reluctantly provides.\n\n I was on hold for over 25 minutes. When the rep came on the line it was like I was interrupting his day....VERY off-hand ""couldn't care less"" attitude ....finally he said that (after I told him it was quite clear the drive had just crashed) I would have to return it to them or to Amazon. . . he was hoping I'd return it to Amazon I'm quite sure. . but I didn't want to as I'd heard that Amazon charged some sort of fee for returns - not sure if that is true if the product is defective and they're replacing it - but anyway - I chose to return it to iRiver. He could NOT give me an RMA over the phone - I had to email the request to him and then he'd forward it to the 'returns department' - - which is all unncessarily complex...and that in a ""few days"" I'd get a reply. Well - to their credit I got an RMA number in a reply email later that day but it said it would take up to 3 weeks to get the replacement. Which is outrageous. I emailed their customer service (through their website link) and asked if this was truly the turn time - they said no - it would be more likely to be a week (the online response was a lot nicer than the guy on the phone) .. and sure enough I got my replacement last Friday. I've had it now for a week .. SO FAR it is working just fine. I'm very pleased with the sound . . . but I couldn't stand the earbuds it came with so replaced those with the Sony MDR-EX71SL earbuds (~$32.00) - they're VERY good for the price. I mean VERY good.\n\n Now - to the player itself. First off I am a firm believer in RTFM (reading the manual) -- so I have read it. And I've read it. And I've read it some more. It is not at all well organized let alone well written! The ""joystick"" thing on the front of the main unit is really not at ALL intuitive. If it weren't for the remote (which I love) I would probably not be able to still, today after a week, navigate through my files and folders! ;-)\n\n I would like to use the database function, but can't because my music files are .wma ...but I had them extremely well organized in MediaPlayer/Media Library on my PC so I don't miss it that much.\n\n I do like the volume - it is sufficient (and then some) and I was worried it might not be - I've heard that the iPod has a very low volume max and also heard that from several reviews here about this item. But I found it to be just fine. And I like my music pretty loud.\n\n What I do wish it had was a REAL random play shuffle feature but it doesn't so I don't even bother with trying to use the repetitive shuffle feature that it does have. And I have to admit I knew this before I bought it.\n\n Would I buy one again? Not sure.\n\n Will I be in a hurry to download the latest (1.4) firmware? (My player has the 1.3v) .. probably not - as it is working now I figure I'll just not fix what ain't broke.\n\n Will I download the Moodlogic H Manager? Uh----NO! I've read a lot of folks say it has hung their computer and trashed out their iRiver so I daren't even touch that.\n\n Biggest complaint: the random shuffle that isn't there, AND the really offhand-bordering on rude customer ""service!""";Not as pleased as I thought I'd be.....
28;33.0;3.0;12.0;480;"With lots of enthusiasm I spurned my wife's urging and purchased an iRiver H-120 instead of an iPod like the one she owns.  The extra features (voice record and a built-in FM tuner lured me to the dark side).  I called it my ""anti-Pod"" music player.  Initially I was delighted with my purchase.  And in some respects I remain reasonably satisfied.  But alas, my dream of a perfect MP3 player remains woefully unfulfilled.\nWhat bothers me about this iRiver player is the unfulfilled ""promise"" from iRiver of frequent and significant firmware updates which would unlock features, correct problems, and otherwise enhance the usefulness of my iRiver purchase.  In as much as I am heavily involved in software development myself, I felt this was a tremendous advandage for the H-120 over the iPod.  After all, Apple never plays up their firmware upgrade capabilities - even though they doubtlessly have this capability.\nIn April, after much talk about the lack of a recent firmware update, iRiver went to the trouble of posting a public notice on the iRiver discussion message board that they would be releasing not one, but TWO firmware updates for the H-120.  One in May 2004 and another to follow in June.  Much joy was expressed on the iRiver message board related to this promise.  Exciptment built and enthusiastic buyers sought out the best deals on these players.  Many were sold with this promise of firmware updates.  Then May came, slowly passing day by day and what?  No firmware update.  No new firmware.  Oh well, everyone talked it up that they would relase both updates in June.  Alas, June came ---- and went...  Still NO firmware.  Now we're halfway through July, and still no firmware.  Nothing.  Nada.  No revised promise.  Nothing encouraging from iRiver.  No nothing.  The silence is deafening.  The discussion on the iRiver forums has soured.  Folks talke of returning their iRivers while they can...  Makes you wonder if iRiver is unable to support the products as they have promised.\nI'll not go so far as to say I'd never buy another iRiver product.  But the odds of me doing that deminish with every passing day that no firmware upgrade is posted on the iRiver site.\nSo if you are thinking of buying an iRiver product with the belief that you're purchase will be well supported with firmware upgrades - as some products truly are - then thing twice and three times before settling on iRiver as your best choice.\nThe hardware itself (at least the H-120 I am familiar with) is first rate.  But the lack of ongoing support leaves me feeling that so much promise is missing from this otherwise fine piece of equipment.\nI'd love to report back one day soon that iRiver has kept their ""promise.""  But at this point I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that they either just don't care, or are incompetent to do anything about it.  Either way it isn't a good sign for iRiver and their customer base...";iRiver H-120 is ALMOST a great MP3 player...
29;52.0;2.0;8.0;481;"The ihp120 is the first mp3 player I've owned, but I have experience with the first gen ipod because my brother owns it.  That said, any reference I have to an mp3 player is one that was made 3 years ago(?).\nHardware:\nYou read many reviews of this player that say the build quality is excellent.  Nothing is perfect and there are hardware related problems.  The US model uses cheap black metallic paint on the outside.  It has already chipped off on many places around the front and sides of my player.  The joystick is uncomfortable to use and to add insult to injury, the scrolling speed for moving down your music list is very slow.  The analog line output is poorly implemented--it's still controlled by the main amplifier which is subject to the volume control.  It's basically just another headphone port.\nSoftware:\nWhere to begin?  The database functionality is extremely poor.  Many have already commented on this so I won't elaborate.  You will be forced to use the file tree mode because of this.  The display is cluttered with useless graphics making long titles unreadable.  You are forced to see the folder name, song, and artist.  You can't change folder name to something more important, like say album title.  The only name that scrolls is the song title.  And the scroll is ugly.  You will have to use the default ""scroll"" which just refreshes the name to show the cut off characters.\nOne function that doesn't work that I wanted is a normal shuffle.  The reason why I and many others bought a HDD mp3 player is becuase we have large mp3 collections.  I wanted to be able to shuffle through my entire player or playlist so I don't hear the same songs/artists over and over.  But the ihp120 doesn't have a real shuffle, so you will hear the same songs in shuffle mode over and over again.  Pathetic.  And this is an existing function, not some new function like On The Fly playlists.  I'm scared to see how that will actually be implemented.  Another thing I didn't like about the ihp120's playlist was that you could never see what songs made up a playlist.  Unless you memorized how the playlist was created on your PC, you're out of luck on where you are in the thing.\nAnd those wanting to use this to record will be upset to know that recorded audio gets corrupted regardless of analog or digital input.\nCustomer Support:\nOne word: NONE.  The only customer support they provide is giving people replacement players.  Getting a replacement player does not address any of the issues above.  They ignore and mislead their customers.  Just visit their internation website and check out their forum.  If you are a die-hard Amiga owner and are used to non-existent customer support, you'll feel right at home here.\nThe POSITIVE:\nNot all things are bad, and there are somethings that the ihp120 does well.  Radio function is good--unless you want to record from it (which was advertised as a function).  The digital outs work.  The only thing I can recommend this player for is to use it as a 20GB removable hard drive.\nSo to summarize, this is not a good music player, but is a good USB hard drive.  If music is your passion and the reason you are looking for an mp3 player, please look elsewhere.";Non-biased Review
30;39.0;5.0;10.0;484;"I bought my iHP-120 two weeks ago, and I love it dearly.  It has been at my side almost constantly, and while I feared when I bought it that it would be a waste of money, I have no regrets whatsoever.  However, if you're reading this, you don't care about that:  you want to know what I like about it.  So, based on my own requirements for a good portable music player, here's what I think is good and bad about the iHP-120:\nPros\n- Battery life:  I've gotten mine to last for 14+ hours, and I think it could likely get the promised 16 if I was careful (i.e. not a lot of skipping around, turned off illumination).\n- Ease of use:  You see the term ""learning curve"" a lot in reviews of this product, but I had no trouble with it.  It was confusing for an hour, maybe, but really, what isn't?  For the most part, the controls are intuitive and well placed.  I know the iPod's scroll wheel is the supposed Holy Grail, but I don't much care for it myself.  I prefer the little iHP joystick, because it's responsive but hard to hit by accident.\n- Transfers:  I hate being forced to use proprietary programs like Musicmatch, so the fact that the iHP just plugs in and appears as a hard drive is perfect for me.  I'd much rather handle my own syncing, thank you.  Plus, this way it's easy to use the device as for back-up or transfer purposes.  I don't have USB 2.0 on my laptop, but I was still able to transfer ~10 GB of music in 3 to 4 hours.  That's more than good enough for me, since I can just do it overnight.\n- Portability:  The iHP is a pleasure to carry around.  Sometimes I put it in my pocket, and sometimes I wear it on my belt with the included carry case.  Either way, I barely notice it.  I haven't bothered with the remote, yet, since right now all the cords seem like overkill, but I think that when I'm wearing more layers of clothing in the winter it could be very helpful.\n- Construction and appearance:  I like the way the iHP looks, and the way it feels.  It's well-built, and you can tell as soon as you pick it up.  Plus, it's still pretty unique.  Everyone's got an iPod, but I've never seen someone else carrying one of these.  If you want, you can claim that's due to the iPod's superiority, but I think it's just the herd instinct at work.\nCons\n- Shuffling:  I want to mention this because I didn't know about it when I bought mine.  The shuffling algorithm on the iHP is very marginal.  When I'm shuffling through my whole drive, it's not a problem, but if I use a playlist, it will play the same ""random"" order EVERY TIME.  You can trick it, sort of, but it's still not random, and that's a pain.  iRiver has promised to fix this in a firmware upgrade, but they're months behind on it, now.\n- Scrolling:  I like the joystick, but it's terrible for scrolling through long lists, because the scroll never accelerates (this is also an obvious flaw, and may well be fixed in later firmware).  This can make finding specific files a lengthy operation.\n- Start-up time:  My drive is only half full, and even so my iHP takes 3-5 minutes to turn on because it has to read the files (this is exacerbated by the fact that I use database mode, which allows me to search artist, album, and genre).  This irritated me until I realized that thanks to the battery life I could generally just leave it on all day.";My new and faithful companion
31;47.0;3.0;9.0;487;I thought this thing would be better than the ipod and dell dj, but it wasn't. To bad because it has a built in voice recorder, Radio, and a LCD remote (wich is awsome). The build quality is sturdy and it looks cool, all black with a bluish green screen. Also a great thing about this is that the batterys trully do last up to 16 hours wich is a LONG time. The sound is great too.\nBut this thing is hard, annoying, and slow to get to you songs. Unless you gave only like 100 songs, you will be bored just trying to get to a song because this thing takes about 10 seconds to get through 100 songs. Also the screen is allitle blury and hard to read. The headsphones that come with this is AWFUL. The FM radio comes in allitle bad. Also its allitle big and bulky.\nDont get me wrong, this is a great mp3 player. I would just suggest and ipod. I own and ipod but am not and ipod freak. I just like the ipod better because its alot easier to use and is more portable. If you want a mp3 player that has alot of features, get this one. If you want a easier to use, and more portable mp3 player then get the ipod. Both are good though.\nIriver fans feel freen to mark no at the bottom......;Well.......
32;77.0;2.0;5.0;488;First time I purchased the item was because the battery only lasted 6 hours.  Also the Wav. files took up to much space.\nSecond time around, battery life a littel better but the player can't read wma. files.  I'm not really feeling this product because it's not living up to the good reviews that I read.  I'm disappointed because I really want to like the player, but it's not working out for me;I'm about to return it for the second time
33;61.0;5.0;7.0;496;"Well, I just wanted to say something about the ""non-working"" FM-Radio another user complained about. It doesn't work when you don't use your remote control, because your remote control is the antenna. You can't build it into the unit for the simple reason that it couldn't receive any programms inside that metal/plastic case. ;)\nOther than that, the only disadvantage is the aforementioned lack to create a playlist on the fly. But I think to use WinAmp playlists is a good choice since you can get that program for free. On the other hand, I don't use playlists because I do mostly listen to an album after another. So no negative point on me for that.\nThe scroll speed could be improved, but it is no real negative point. After all, you can adjust the scroll speed in the menu.\nID3-Tag recognition works great, but I have 2 CD's out of 350 that it doesn't play when chosen through the ID3-Tag menu. Chosing them from the file menu works though. I don't know why it doesn't work, but both albums are 2 CD albums which are named like 1/2 and 2/2. Maybe a future Firmware solves this problem.\nAnother little thing is that artificial ""half a second""-gap between songs. You don't hear it when you listen to ""normal"" songs, but since I'm a great fan of Prog-Metal/Rock and they usually produce concept albums which play on CD song after song without a single gap...";This is a great DAP
34;73.0;4.0;6.0;499;and settled on the iriver.  I have not been disappointed.  After 2 months of frequent use I have this to say about the product:  It has at least 100%longer battery life than my ipod.  It has a great, durable feel to it.  I like the fact that it acts as an external hard drive.  I don't use the database function because all my files are in .wma format.  I use media player as my jukebox on my computer and it does a nice job of labelling the folders the music goes in, so there's been little hassle organizing music onto my iriver.  A word of advice, if your music isn't well organized it can take a long time to find things on the iriver. The firmware is upgradeable which means bugs can be fixed regularly, although I haven't yet encountered one. It also sounds great.  I replaced the standard earbuds with Shure e-2c's and this thing sounds killer!\n\nMy cons list is short.  I don't like the fact that I can't create playlists on the fly.  I wish the database function worked with file types other than mp3.  I also wish the player supported more codecs like flac and shorten.  I am clinging to the hope that these issues can be looked at with firmware upgrades.\n\nUPDATE 8.3.04\nMy unit crashed after less than 60 days of ownership and relatively light use!!!  It is fried and iriver is in the process of getting me a new one.  I am worried because of all the negative reviews on iriver service, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt if they take care of me on this one.  Nonetheless, this product is not as great as I first believed!  2 STARS!!!!;I looked for a long time....
35;21.0;5.0;16.0;499;I'm not one to give compliments easily but I would have to say that the iRiver is one of the (if not THE) best players out there!\nI've got it from Best Buy and I have a killer warrenty! At first when I opened the package (which isn't that large) I was extremely dissapointed at the earphones!\nWhy?\nThe left earbud wire was considerably shorter from the right! I was furious! I wanted to return it right away, but BestBuy closed. I decided to check up on some support forums to see if anyone had this same problem and if it can be replaced....to my suprise, THEY ALL COME LIKE THAT, but it's for a very clever reason...so you can wrap the right bud around the back of your neck to avoid the wires being in your way! I thought that was sooooo cool!\nNow for those who are worrying about not having a import program for the player, don't worry. It acts JUST LIKE an external hardrive, so you don't have to worry about pressing something wrong or clicking the wrong option, simply get the music file onto your computer (via any method you use) and DRAG and DROP, organize the files like you would in your regular hardrives (name your folder, files, ect.). I prefer this method over any program!\nMake sure your file names aren't exremely long, you really don't need them to be 52 chars long now do you?\nAlso the new firmware upgrade (v1.4) allows you to UPLOAD LYRICS FOR EACH SONG! Now how cool is that!?\nI haven't messed with the recorder that much, im to excited with copying 1GB movies onto the player and transfering them to my friends computer, its the ultimate machine! And if a new one comes out (That's better) best buy will give me back every penny I spent on this and put it towards that new player. You can't go wrong!\nDon't take my word for it, go to the stores and ask, hold it, mess with it, you'll love it.\nAlot of people want the I-pod because of the name, trust me, I had my heart set on the I-Pod, but thanks to the reviews at amazon and Hand-On Experience with it, it has no comparison to the Awe of the IRiver. THe fact that the IRiver had more that 2x the battery life span alone beats the I-Pod. I don't care if the I-Pod could mysteriously plays movies (it doesn't but still if it did) , you can only use it for 4-6 Hours (Iriver runs 14-18hrs) then it's not worth it, and I can't begin to fathom spending 300 bux on something thats going to die in less than 2 years in which I have to cough up 100bux for a replacement cause no stores offer a coverage plan, but the Iriver is expected to last 4+ years without losing longevity and BestBuy covers my next 4 Battery Replacements for free...and I can extend it for 40 bux more....AWESOME!\nMy advice: Try it yourself. But you WON'T be dissapointed.;It's simply amazing.
36;9.0;2.0;39.0;521;"Let me begin my stating that the iRiver hardware is simply top-notch.  The device itself is compact, the battery life is great, the sound quality is superb (assuming you aren't using the included earbuds), the full function backlit 4-line LCD in-line remote is a godsend, the player can be accessed simply as a hard drive, it plays a large number of file formats, etc.\nHowever, I am regrettably returning this thing to the store.  Why?  Because iRiver simply makes it too damn hard to get music onto the device from my CD collection.\n1) There is NO included ripping/organizing software.  Zilch.  Nada.  What you get on CD is drivers so a Win98 box can talk to it, and a small program to create the database file so your player can access the music by Artist or Genre or Album or Track Name.  (Without the database, you navigate your songs solely with a directory tree.)\n2) While you can easily download software that will perform what I am complaining about in 1), no one package will do it all for you.  To rip a CD, you have to do the following: (using programs you scrounge up from the internet yourself.  iRiver is no help)\na) Rip the CD with the program of your choice.  This program will also need to sort them into sane directories, for when the database doesn't work.\nb) Run another program to make sure that no filenames are longer than 48 characters.  Why?  Because the database function won't work otherwise.  (With pop music, this isn't a problem, but it sure is with classical music.  For example, from Hilary Hahn's Bach Concerto's CD, CDDB returns the following track name: ""10 - Concerto for obe, violin, strings & continuo in c minor, bwv 1060 #1: Allegro"")\nc) Run a third program to sync up your directory tree w/ the iRiver.  If you just drag 'n drop, it takes a lot longer.\nd) Run a fourth program to build the iRiver's internal database.\n3) The filename MUST start with the track number.  If it doesn't, the player sorts the files in an album in alphabetical order.  (Which is a big no-no for lots of classical music, along with musicals, and classic albums that were simply meant to be played in the right order, like the Greatful Dead.)  Too bad this makes the search by track function completely useless.  The player is too stupid to use the track number tag in most music files.\n4) re: That silly 48 character limit I mentioned earlier.  A program that simply truncates the filename isn't gonna work.  The track name that CDDB returned really IS the title of the piece.  I could abbreviate, but I really don't feel like doing that BY HAND for every CD that needs it.\n5) Scrolling:  Scrolling through a long list of anything on this device is SLOW.  A progressive scroll speed, ala Creative would work wonders.\n6) on-the-fly playlists:  I used this function w/ my dearly departed Creative Nomad Jukebox 2.  All I want to do is queue up several tracks and/or Artists and/or Albums to play.  Nope, can't do it.  This feature is promised by iRiver ""Real Soon Now"" via a firmware upgrade, but I'm not holding my breath.\nI am a geek for a living, but my time is more valuable than spending hours fighting with my consumer electronics.\nIf you already have a pile of neatly sorted MP3's (with short filenames, and tagged with track numbers) on your computer, then this player is great.  Simply drag your music collection onto the player and you are good to go.  If you have an extensive CD collection you need to rip, you could have a problem.";I REALLY wanted to like this product...
37;1.0;5.0;182.0;527;I recently bought the iRiver iHP-120 (H120), at Best Buy. I had a 10% off coupon, so bought it for $300. At the same time my roommate had bought a 15 GB Ipod. So, I had ample chance to play with both the players. I must tell you that I love the iRiver player. This has got lot more features, quality for lesser price.\nThings I liked :\n1) The quality of the music is amazing.\n2) It plays all the formats that I generally use.\n3) The radio is very clear.\n4) Feels robust.\n5) Small (almost the same size as iPod).\n6) Comes with all the accessories. ( My roomate had to buy leathercase and USB cable)\n7) Can be used as an external harddisk. No drivers needed. No software needs to be installed. Just plug n play.\n8) The recording feature. Though I haven't used this feature yet, online reviews tell me that, the quality of recording is just awesome.\n9) Awesome battery life.\nThings I did not like:\n1) The leathercase has a belt clip, through which you have to pass a belt, to keep it on your waist. In the gym , I wear gym shorts and I don't wear a belt. so, I have to hold it in my hand and run. I would have liked a clip-on type belt clip.\n2) The ear-phones that come with the set are not the best.\n3) The LED is kind of dim (comapred to the iPod).\niPod Vs iRiver\n1) iRiver comes with radio, recording and accessories. The iPod does not.\n2) In iRiver I don't have to install any software and arranage all my songs. I can just drag and drop all the folders in the player. I like this arrangement compared to the ID3 tags. In iPod you have to arrange all your songs using ID3 tags. My roomate spent the whole Memorial Day weekend arranging his songs :-)\n3) Ipod can not be used as an external hard-drive. iRiver can be used as an external hard-drive, no drivers need to be installed. Just drag n drop.\n4) The quality of music is about the same in both the players (best quality).\n5) iRiver's battery life is double compared to iPod( 16 hrs to 8hrs)\n6) The iPod looks cooler and I loved the button placement, sensitivity of the buttons of the iPod.\n7) The iPod's ear buds are too cool.\nBottom line : If you want more bang for your buck, and looks don't matter that much, go with the iRiver.;I love this product.
38;28.0;5.0;14.0;529;"This is a great player.\nPros:\n1. It's smaller than what yor saw in pictures.\n2. The battery life is really long. They said 16 hrs, it's not true, it's longer than that. In iRiver Chinese forum, somebody has a full test of battery life, one diagram of which you can find in iRiver's international site too. If you just play 128k mp3s without operation, it lasts 19+hrs; if you play 192-256k VBR mp3s it lasts 16+hrs. All mp3 in my unit is 192-256k VBR, I let it play continuously with some but not too much operation, it lasts 16hrs. Remember, this is not the optimal number claimed by the manufacturer, it's real life battery hours.\n3. The sound quality is simply the best. Another Chinese user tests the frequency response, harmonic distortion and two other factors, sorry I can't remember, of iPod and ihp-120. The ihp-120 beats iPod in two areas, and they are equally good in the other two.\n4.iRiver cares about users. They listen to what we wants. Two firmwares will be released soon, one in May, one in June. The June firmware has on-the-fly playlist function, which makes some reviews obsolete.\nThese are the pros other reviewers don't mention. If you want to find more pros, you should read others' review.\nCons:\n1.the documentation is weak. It's good enough for basic use.";Nice player
39;57.0;4.0;8.0;532;"Ok, this review is for everyone who spent as much time debating whether to get the ipod or the river as much as I have. for the last few weeks I have been debating which one to get. I finally decided on the iriver for various reasons (which I will explain later). Then I spent the last 5 days after I bought the player pondering whether or not I had made the right choice in the first place. I only spent almost one month of my time over this damn thing so I guess I could spend another hour or so writing a real review. Sorry, I only give this stupid story because it needs emphasis that this player is not as easy to use as an ipod probably would be. still, im not really a gadget expert or anything and I finally figured it out. so you can too. First lemme tell you why you should get this over the ipod. 1. you get more hard drive for your money's worth ($330 for iriver and 400 for ipod) 2. this has a MUCH better remote 3. battery life for the iriver is 2x more than a fully functional ipod one; note the reports going around of faulty ipod batteries 4. the extended warranty is two years longer than apple's for the same price (kinda a bummer with that battery problem too huh?) 5. unless you want to be ridiculously trendy... who cares if it's `white' or `slim' (not by much) or has some cool touch wheel or something... c'mon, think for yourself, do the math, and make a rational decision. Ok so getting some of the songs from my album collection into the right categories on the player was a pain (**see bellow for something that might come in handy for some newby iriver owners). BUT customer support at iriver was very helpful. I called twice, though it took some time to be connected with a technician, and both times they seemed very knowledgeable. So here's the worst part about the player (which incidently is also a problem with the ipods): tracks that run together on your commercial CDs, onced ripped on your iriver, have like a .5 sec pause between them. Call it a petty remark but it can get a little annoying on those CDs that you love listening to for its `sessions'. Yea so that's it\n**I use itunes for ripping CDs. It might be slow but it's the only way (that I found) to get the songs to play in its original album order on your iriver. Then just rename the ID3 to v. 1.0 before moving the tracks into it's designated album folder in the IHP-100 window. Still itunes is kinda slow at importing (at least on a PC). Any other suggestions for faster ripping times please email me.";make that four and a half...
40;15.0;5.0;21.0;551;There are many ways to carry music with you now.  A full sized CD, Minidisc (my choice until now), solid state MP3 players but this product from I-River beats them all.\nFirst you're not just limited to transferring music files to this mini hard drive.  It accepts any kind of file so you can transport computer files from home to work or use some of the 20 gigabytes available to store personal files.  If it's on your computer's hard drive it can be stored on the IHP-120.\nFor music the IHP-120 is exceptional.\nYou can sort files for playing by title or artist of course but also by tags you've added to your mp3 files like album names or music genre.  You can easily shuffle between titles in one directory or choose to play songs from multiple directories (maybe you have an 'rock' directory and a 'country' directory) shuffling between them.\nYou can certainly find a sound setting to suit your style (and quality of speakers/headset) with fully adjustable bass and treble levels, an equalizer and other features.\nDon't forget the built in FM radio (with auto seek and storage for up to 50 presets that you choose).  The included (and lighted) remote control mimics all buttons and settings on the main unit so you can search or change settings on the fly.  Need to take verbal notes?  There is a built in recorder (and included microphone) or you can utilize high quality optical(laser) inputs and outputs for recording direct from your stereo (if it's equipped).\nIs there a downside to this unit?  Maybe.  You'll have to read the instruction manual....probably more than once.\nEach button has multiple functions so while pressing something once might produce one option pressing then holding the same button might produce another.  You can spend hours just playing with all the pre-sets.  Once those are settled on and your music (or other files) loaded all you'll probably be concerned with is turning the unit on/off and scrolling through the files which is very simple.  You 'must' use Winamp (a free download) to create playlists.\nI-River doesn't use a fancy interface, it's a simple drag and drop using Explorer on your Windows desktop.\nThis one's a winner!;The 'Only' Way To Carry Your Music (and other) Files
41;58.0;5.0;8.0;564;Let me start by saying that I have been apprehensive about purchasing a portable mp3 player. I did not want to buy an iPod, but wanted most of the feature it had to offer. I came across a few brands, this being one of them. After comparing and contrasting, I decided to buy this player, and here is what I have to say about it after using it for 3 weeks.\nComing out of the box, it took me only 10 minutes to load up the software and have it playing some mp3's. The simple drag and drop interface works seamlessly, and creating an index of the mp3's takes only seconds.\nWhen the unit starts up, it only takes 15 seconds with about 10 gigs of music on it. Note that this is with everything indexed so that you can search by artist, song name, album, genre, or just the file structure.\nThe remote for the unit is beautiful. Now only is it easy to use, but it is small and stylish.\nActual battery life is just around 16 hours of continuous play. I take this to the gym and to work, and when selecting different songs and turning it on and off, I get about 12 hours of play.\nThe built in voice recording also works well to record lectures from class. The build in mic is sensitive enough to catch almost every word, even when sitting in the back of the class.\nHere are the Pros and Cons for the iRiver iHP120:\nPros -\n Long battery life (12-16 hours)\n Built in voice recording\n Wonderful remote\n Easy drag and drop interface\n Fast load time\n USB 2.0 connection (transfered 10 gigs in less than 7 minutes)\n The case it comes with is nice\n Easy to find songs\n Plays winamp playlists\n Firmwire upgradeable\nCons -\n Cannot buy replacement batteries\n Price is in the upper range for similar mp3 players\nOverall, I think this is easily the best portable mp3 player on the market at this time. iRiver has always made reliable, sturdy, and stylish products. This one is all those, and possibly more.;Very happy with my player
42;45.0;5.0;10.0;579;"I got the iRiver for it's recording abilities only and I love it.  I used it with a pair of binaural mics to record a classical concert and it sounded fantastic.  The onboard mic preamp is very clean and powered my mics just fine.  I do a lot of field recording of sound effects and this unit has just replaced my portable DAT recorder as my main recording device.  It's very easy to use for recording and the fact that you can record at 44k WAV files is fantastic.  Also has the ability to accept multiple input types (optical, line in, external mic) all from the same 1/8"" input.\nRecording does eat up the battery a lot more than just playing music does.  It only lasts about 5-6 hours (possibly more) of steady recording, but that is still quite a bit.\nIf you need a portable recorder for any reason, you will be extremely happy with the iRiver.";Awesome portable recorder
43;25.0;5.0;15.0;588;After doing extensive research on MP3 players to try to purchase the best bang for my buck, I decided on this Iriver.  Ipod was definitely a choice, but not enough features and too much money.\nLet me start with the basics:\nPrice = Ipod $400  Iriver - $360\nFeatures of Iriver:\n16 Hours of battery life - Ipod's 6 hours isn't getting it done.  They've had time to fix this problem.  The Iriver has a much better battery (lithium polymer).\nFM Tuner, Line Out, Line In:  Ipod should of considered the FM tuner.  While not the biggest deal, it should still be part of the package.\nLCD Remote Control - FINALLY!!!  When you have one, you'll understand why it's so nice.  Being able to see what's playing, and what will be next, is a major plus.\nSound Quality - While the earbuds aren't the best (stock ones never are), they are decent.  The sound quality is still phenomenal.  Many adjustable EQ setting make it sound great.  I will soon invest in better earbuds, but at the moment, the stock ones will do.\nRemovable drive - No 3rd party software.  Drag and drop.  Simple as that.\nVoice Recorder - Excellent quality.  Apple sells this as an accessory.  I'd rather have it all built in.\nUpgradeable firmware - Always a plus.\nMagnesium body - Seems much more durable than Ipod's plastic exterior which scratches very easily.\nThere are a couple cons, but not many.\nThe stock earbuds are ear sensitive.  Some people they fit fine, others may just want to get another set of earphones.\nInterface - Some people not used to being more on the technical side may have trouble getting used to it.  It is not that hard though.  The manual included has plenty of illustrations showing step by step how to do each function.  After about a half hour of messing with it, i got it fine.\nOn The Fly Playlist - One thing I wish they'd add.  Maybe they will upgrade the firmware. (hint hint)\nCarrying Case - Makes it a bit bulkier but can still get into your pocket with ease.\nAll in all, if you want a great MP3 player with almost everything included, for less money than an Ipod, this is your winner.\nRemember, just because it's popular, doesn't mean it's the best.;Ipod Who?
44;4.0;3.0;81.0;603;"After reading the glowing reviews posted on this site, I decided to purchase the iRiver ihp 120 instead of the iPod.  I am not certain that I made the right decision.  On the plus side, I prefer the iRiver's compatibility with mp3 files (vs. having to use iTunes and the .aac format), and I like the fully-functional remote, even if it is a bit cumbersome with all the wires.  On the negative side, I am very disappointed in the iRiver's ""on the fly"" performance and its very limited ability to recognize and properly play playlists.  The iRiver only recognizes playlists created with WinAmp, and cannot read those saved in, for example, MusicMatch or RealOne -- even though the file extension and all other relevant file information are the same.  Likewise, the iRiver cannot create playlists on its own.  A feature permitting the user to queue up one song while another is playing -- which is casually dropped as a ""tip"" at the back of the users manual -- is a far cry from being able to create a 5 or 10 or however many song playlist as the mood may strike.  Moreover, the iRiver is very picky in terms of what files its proprietary database decides to recognize, which further complicates making playlists.  An unknown universe of characters will cause the database not to recognize a song, as will any song file with over 52 characters (a threshold easily reached under basic tagging formats).  If the database doesn't recognize a particular song, it will not appear in any of the iRiver-created browsing groups (band, album title, song tile) and iRiver will not recognize that song in a playlist.  It's frustrating, to say the least.  That said, iRiver's support people are great, and I am not giving up on the chance that firmware or new software will become available improving iRiver's on the go performance.";Lacks On the Fly Functionality

46;27.0;4.0;15.0;605;"***** UPDATE: After several months of using both I have to say choose based on your requirements. iPod is soooooo much nicer to use and look at it's ridiculous. But the iRiver has a few more feature. If all you want is an mp3 player (or you use a mac), iPod rules the roost. If you want the record functionality and driver free installation iRiver is for you. It's kinda like a mini Mac vs PC debate really*****\n\n Thinking about an iRiver? For my use I rate it better than ipod because of the battery, the recording, and the remote. I have both iRiver and iPod - at least I do until I sell the Apple.\nSizewise it's very similar to ipod. Feels marginally deeper, lighter, narrower.\niRiver Pluses\n - it has a much better battery\n - it can record direct to WAV or MP3 (at configurable bit rates) from either the built in microphone (includes voice activated)  or the optical/electrical line in.\n - it has optical line out\n - it has an FM tuner (not that I ever listen to the radio)\n - it doesn't require any additional software\n - it has a full function remote (including navigation, record, LCD, etc)\n - it has more audio configurability\n - you can plug it into as many computers as you like an it doesn't care about being shared around\n - it has a nice leather case that exposes only the controls and has a see through panel so you can see the screen\n - it comes with the USB cable (iPod, you gotta buy it)\nMinuses\n - it is only about 75% as beautiful as an ipod (still much better than any other HDD music player I've seen eg Nomad)\n - the remote isn't as ""solid"" as the ipod (trade off for function)\n - the standard ear phones are pretty rubbish\n - it doesn't have an organiser, or text file reader, or clock like the ipod (do you care? I never used them anyway)\n - navigation is a little fiddlier (but you get used to it). Particularly setting preferences and things. Many of the controls are context specific. i.e. they may do different things depending on what mode you are in and holding them down does something different from pressing them. If your user is a technophobe this might be an issue. iPod is extremely clean and easy to operate. This not so much.\n - you don't get the cool database software for more serious searching scanning etc if you run it with a mac. If you do want to use this with you PC you have to update the database separately and that DOES require software to be installed on the PC.\n - it doesn't do playlist creation (iPod does)\n - the display is more cluttered than the iPod.\n - the case has a belt loop instead of a clip so it isn't easy on/off if you like belt carrying (I use a pocket).\n - the play/pause, stop, record buttons on the player are pretty small. They are fine on the remote.\n - if you use it with a mac (like me) you suffer the idiosyncracy of a second .file being created for every file you write using the Mac file mangler ""Finder"". The iRiver displays these and will attempt to play them.";mp3tastic
47;67.0;4.0;7.0;608;Solid product, does what it says it will do.\nIf your a computer hacker kind of guy, then this by far is the product for you.  If your a casual user, get the iPod.\nGreat features: Built in FM tuner, remote display, no proprietary format needed, Great size, Large HD, easy to hook up to PC and nice leather case.  These features on a iPod add up $$.\nHowever, the interface is absolutely terrible!  Not intuitive what-so-ever and the button layout is in-efficient also. I used the iPod and it is music to your fingers to use compared to the iRiver.  However once you learn and train yourself on what buttons to use and when your fine.  I couldn't figure out how to turn the radio on easily, had to look at the manual.  Nothing on the device is layed out in a way a person would think and use it.\nI handed it to a friend and ask him to play the radio, he got frustrated after 10 minutes and gave up.  Asked him to play a selection of tracks for replay, took him a while to figure out.  My friend handed me his iPod, within seconds I could do whatever he requested.\nI'm a techie and fairly inteligent person that loves technology, but on the other hand I'm a simplistic person.  This device is not simple to use, if you get frustrated quickly with computers or like a beautiful user interface get a iPod.\nOH! make sure you load the driver that comes with it and load the dB interface (follow the manual, it is easy).  That way it indexes your music.\nBut for the price, the features, non-proprietary issues, this was for me.  They do have upgradable firmware so hopefully they will work on the interface better.;Solid Product, but just miss being Awesome
48;68.0;5.0;7.0;608;I bought this nice MP3 player from amazon.com for 270 bucks (330 - 30GC - 30MIR).  Since then I have been listening it for about two weeks and I am very happy with the money I spent.\nI had been researching on a hard drive based player for a long long time.  Never really thought about iPod because it lacks a FM tuner, which is a must for me.  There was one time a slick-looking Rio Riot 20GB player became quite attractive to me, but many negative reviews from CNET made me give up.  When iHP series came out, I totally fell for it because it has all the features I wanted.\nThe 20GB hard drive is large enough to hold my favorties songs out of my 40GB+ collection.  The black body is very lovely with the babyblue back-lit LCD screen, and the size is smaller than I expected.  The LCD remote is a great plus since it can do everything the machine can and it's just beautiful.  The battery life is even better than it's advertised: I left it on randomly playing MP3s (volume 24 out of 40 and no EQs or WOWs), and it lasted an amazing 18 and half hours.  Yes, 18.5 hours!  I've not tried an iPod, but I heard that it lasts no more than half of iHP.\nThere are many other great features about iHP, but there are a fews things I don't like much about.  The song database feature is good, which allows you to browse music by albums, artists, genres.  But after I build a database of about 1200 songs with its windows software, the player spends more than 10 seconds to startup.  I would expect the loading time to increase since I am only using half of the 20GB right now.  Also, the players looks a bit bulky with its leather case on.  I really hope it could be even smaller.\nAll in all, with lots of pros and only a few cons, I'd say I really love this player.  And the 1-year warranty (unlike 90-days from many other brands) really make me reassured of this investment.\nOh, FM tuner, how can I forget the FM tuner, iHP-120 stores 20 stations and the reception is quite good.  It will bring me out of boredom when I have listened to all the songs in my player 10+ times.;Yet Another Happy Owner
49;32.0;5.0;14.0;612;"After doing a lot of research ont this and other mp3 players, I decided to purchase this product over the iPod because of the cheaper price, better Windows compatibility, .ogg support, and everything else that's already been mentioned.\nWhat nobody else has mentioned but is (to me, at least), a big plus, is the line-out plug, which allows a second set of headphones to be plugged into the player.  This is great if you're hanging out with one of your friends and you need something to do.  Instead of each of you being isolated in your own musical universe, you can sing along together to the music.  And unlike many CD players, the line-out sound quality and volume is exactly the same as the normal headphone jack's.  Neither the Rio Karma nor the iPod has this feature.\nSome rumors that I've heard which I'd like to disprove:\n1. ""It's big, bulky, and ugly.""\nAlthough I have to admit that the iPod is cuter and sleeker, I really like the black design.  The carrying case is indeed very functional, so that you don't have to take it out of its case ever.  Unfortunately, the case itself is rather ugly and makes the player seem about 5 times more bulky.  However, since most of the time you have the main unit tucked away somewhere, this shouldn't be a big issue.\n2. ""The scrolling is slow.""\nCompared to the iPod, the scrolling is a bit slower, but the speed is (I believe) adjustable, and at any rate, it's fast enough for me.  If you have this problem, you might want to consider further organizing your music into subfolders.\n3. ""It takes forever to load.""\nI believe that this complaint was made only when the user attempted to use the database function.  Most of us organize our music by folder and shouldn't have this problem.\n4. ""The text is too small.""\nThe Rio Karma's is way smaller.  Although my eyesight isn't perfect, I have no problem reading the text without my glasses.\n5. ""It's too complicated.""\nActually, the iRiver is very intuitive.  Even without the very well-written manual with excellent illustrations, the device shouldn't be hard to figure out at all, especially since you don't need any special software to transfer music.\nThese were probably my main concerns when purchasing this product, and they've all been pretty much answered.  And ahhh the remote is so freaking adorable!";Good if you have friends who like your music.

51;59.0;5.0;8.0;618;I am going to try and keep this short and to the point. I recently bought a iRiver, and right away i was impressed by the looks, durablility, and how easy it was to use. This is true plug and play.\nIts my mp3 player, external hdd, FM Tuner, and voice recorder.\nTo copy music to the iRiver you don't need **ANY** 3rd party software at all, just drag and drop. Its just as easy to copy and move from MP3 player to MP3 player.\nThe iPod can only copy files to itself and or delete. So if you are looking for a good place to backup your MP3s don't buy the iPod, cause you can not get them back off of it, but apple does not tell you that upfront, you have to find out the hard way like i did. The iPod also has a battery issue. You have to break the case to open it, there is no way to open it. Thats apples way of making more money from the consumer. I did the apple switch, i switched to iRiver.;Best mp3 player ever..... a sure ipod killer!!!
52;41.0;5.0;11.0;619;"This is my second review, with a little more technical data for those who are interested...\n1. Built in recording function is very easy to use, and great for making digital recordings from analog sources. (Patch the iRiver into tape deck using included cord, make the digital recording, download to PC, and burn a CD! Worked like a charm!)\n2. iRiver body is made of magnesium. I don't know if this actually has any real advantage, but at least conceptually it seems better than plastic.\n3. Able to load & read text files! The display, while generous, is a bit small for using this as a dedicated electronic book machine, but it's still a nice feature; more practical in my view than having built-in games.\n4. File system can recognize 9999 files. This is fine for the 20GB iRiver, as most music files are >2 MB. (At least mine are.) It raises a concern for the 40GB iRiver... I don't know if the 40 GB model has the same 9999 file limit, but you could potentially not be able to utilize the full 40 GB.\n5. More on the importance of WMA over MP3: for the same memory, WMA sounds better. Even if you have TONS of hard drive space for large files, there is an advantage to not making your music files larger than they need to be: Hard drive players use a read-ahead buffer, so the hard drive is only accessed intermittently. This is an energy-saving feature. So, using better file-compression algorithms ends up giving you better battery life.";Some technical data
53;7.0;5.0;49.0;620;"Like virtually all of you, I considered this & the 20 GB iPod. Those iPod commercials look so cool & it's so hard to see something about iRiver. But I first decided on the iRiver iHP 120 because the battery life is awesome. Li-polymer is MUCH better than Li-ion (iPod). It comes with all these cables and attachments you wouldn't expect. I was afraid I'd have to buy additional accessories, but there's nothing else I'd want, except maybe a cradle (which they don't make). BTW, the case is awesome; there's nothing I'd change about it. The sound quality is awesome, especially if you adjust the settings to your liking and upgrade your headphones. (My personal recommendation & favorites: Grado SR-80. Awesome bass. Not cheap headphones, but an outstanding value for audiophiles & I love the retro look. Read about them. You'll be amazed how much better your music sounds with good headphones/speakers.) It's tough to try out the unit since it's not carried in many stores, so let me mention the only things that I don't like about it. Read someone else's review for the positive aspects; there are SO many.\n1) It's database-tagging system only recognizes .mp3 format files (I like using WMA), but since it's firmware and database software upgradeable, I'm ""hoping"" iRiver will come up with a newer version that will address this. Regardless, I like leaving my music on random shuffle, so it's not a huge problem for me.\n2) iPod has cute little side features & games. iRiver is for music only & file transferring (but it does these two main things better than the iPod does). iRiver's ""drag & drop"" functionality is awesome.\n3) iPod's slide-wheel interface is cooler than iRiver's joystick.\n4) It doesn't play protected audio files downloaded from pay services like MusicMatch. Of course, you could use the iRiver's in-line ripping to output your protected file from your computer's music card to the iRiver to rip directly (which it does). This will (SHH!!) bypass the protection on your music by doing this, but I don't know what changes in music quality this may result in. I only listen to music from my CD collection that I ripped legally; you should too. I'm pretty sure you can even use an optical line to do ripping of protected music files, though I haven't tried yet.\n5) It ain't cheap. Then again, iPod = iRiver + 10% cost - battery life - extra-detailed audio features.\nAnyway, I've got tons of positives, but I thought I'd give you the major negatives on it, because those are so hard to figure out until you try the unit yourself. It doesn't get the publicity the iPod does, but it keeps a really picky electro/audiophile like me happy.";No commercial gimmicky hype, just word-of-mouth quality.
54;79.0;5.0;5.0;624;As a music junkie, this is a must own. I've had the iHP-120 for about 2 months now, and I go everywhere with it. Record sounds/speech thru it's internal mic or plug in your own mic, the recorded sounds can be saved in mp3 or wav format at a quality level set by you. Playback files of ogg, mp3, wav, wma format. The internal firmware that controls the player is upgradeable from iRiver.com.\nIf you only need the basic features and like something sleak and stylish, the iPod is probably a good bet, though i have honestly scoured the net for reviews b4 i chose my player, and i have read a lot of complaints about the iPod malfunctioning or breaking down.\nA huge plus of the iRiver is that you can just plug it straight into your computer and it'll read as an external hard drive, no hassle with installing dodgy music management software. This machine fully deserves to be called the iPod's leading competitor, and in my humble opinion, it should be considered the benchmark for all others.;This is NOT an mp3 player. It is a MULTI-CODEC JUKEBOX
55;29.0;4.0;15.0;624;"I own this player for about a week now. Let me start off saying that I've always been a fan of iRiver, as they always include the features that ""everyone wants"". With this product, they waited for everyone else to release jukeboxes, and saw what sold, and what didn't and put together what I think is a player that has everything you could possibly want. It is the ONLY high-end player to use file and folder browsing (also means it detects as an external harddrive when you plug it into the pc, no need for drivers under windows ME/2000/XP). It is also the ONLY player that allows viewing both ways --That's right, you can view both by folder view, OR by index, using Artist, Album, Song Title, Genre, etc, (though I will mention that their indexing system is rather weak, more on that later..)\nThis is also the only player I know to fully support every feature on the remote. That means that you can completely control everything from the remote, as well as even go into the options menu and change settings. You never have to take the player out of your pocket! The player's options are also extremely customizable, and like the Creative Nomad jukeboxes, this player has a ton of cool sound effects settings. It has EAX support built in. The sound on this player is superior to the iPod, but not the Nomad Jukeboxes (nothing is...), but it comes real close.\nThe Bad:\nThe controls are a bit hard to learn at first, as each button on the remote can be both turned left, right, pushed in, or held in for a few seconds, but this turns out to be extremely rewarding, becuase once you DO learn the controls (takes about a week), you will find every option (including Sound EQ, and play mode), just a click away!. Once you learn the controls, you will love them.\nThe Indexing system is also rather lousy. If your files exceed the maximum path allowed, the index will not pick them up (the maximum is quite large, but apparently, I've reached it). You also must ""add"" all files into the database after copying them onto the device. (of course, because the player has no way of knowing you used Windows Explorer to copy more music on) Right-clicking a folder and clicking ""Add to DB"" takes care of that though. I have never successfully been able to ""Add files to DB"" either. Every time, if I wanted the newly music to actually work in the database, I had to delete the index file  completely and recreate it, for it to work (takes about 10 min on a full drive) My suggestion for this player is to just use the folder view for selecting your files, and use a program like ""Tagscanner"" to arrange your music into folders, based on their ID3 tags, however you like them, for example:\n..\..\Sorted Music\%1\%4 - %3\%7  %2\nmeans: ..\..\Sorted Music\Artist\Year - Album Name\Track# - Name\nso if you can completely sort out your music into folders using a program like this, I don't know why you'd want to use an ""indexing system"" anyway.\n...I don't think there's a better player out there, though I hear the Rio Karma is also a really good one! ..As many of you know a great competitor of this player is the iPod. As my title says, this player isn't as hot, but totally blows the iPod away in features. It is also built better. My friends iPod broke after a couple of months of using is responsibly, and iPod is CHARGING for tech support questions on it. Heres what this player has, that the iPod doesn't: A) The ability to customize settings. B) Recording capability. C) built in FM tuner. D) EAX sound effects, equalizers, whatever. E) Detects as a ""mass storage device"" and doesn't need any software to load music on under Windows ME/2000/XP. iPod also detects as a mass storage device, but it needs EphPod, iTunes, iPod manager, or MusicMatch Jukebox to load music on. F) Buttons that work when you're wear gloves, or if it's cold outside. G) A better price.\n...I don't think the perfect player exists, but this comes real close! With it's upgradeable firmware, and great support by iRiver, this player may reach pefection one day! In the meantime, get it, and enjoy the ""almost-perfect player""";Definitely the BEST player, though not as hot as the iPod
56;53.0;5.0;9.0;624;"i have read most of the reviews for this product and there is one HUGE feature that people fail to point out.  this feature, IMHO, blows all MP3s out of the water.  the iRiver can also mimick as an external HDD.  you can store any file on it.  you can backup your laptop on it.  i wouldn't do that because i want music on my player.  however, with the diminishing floppy, cd/dvd burning, the coming of age of the memory stick, this is the mother of all file transfers.  just plug it into the USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0 (just lack of speed is the difference)) of your computer, windows recognizes the player as a mass storage device and creates a driver letter for it.  after that, you can create your own directory structure on the player and drag and drop any file onto it.  only the files that the player recognizes will show up in the iRiver's display.\nthis player has been quipped the ""techies mp3 player"", but do not let that discourage you from thinking there is something hard about setting it up.  there absolutely isn't.  it just comes load with features.  reads FIVE different file types and has all kinds of equalizer options including SRS, a voice recorder, tune into FM radio stations, optical line in and out, and more.\nin comparison of a swiss army knife, the iPod is the little thing you attach to your keychain.  the iRiver is the big multifunctional tool that needs a little poach to be carried in properly.\neven though the player is a bit bigger than most other players, it comes with a remote that has all the functions that you could do on the player.  so throw the player in your backpack and clip the remote to your shirt or belt or whatever and enjoy the great sound that comes out of this player.\noh, the iRiver also comes with a leather case to keep it from getting scratched up.  just look at the list of stuff this thing can do above and compare it against any MP3 Player.  there is no competition.\nso please think twice before buying into pop culture and looking stylish.\n(i'm not affiliated with iRiver in anyway, i just really like this product and want to spread the word that the iPod is a piece of marketing junk)";amazing product
57;50.0;5.0;10.0;628;"I looked for a long time at MP3 players and I ended up buying both the iPOD and this one. I didn't like the iPOD for a couple of reasons, the short battery life, the easily scratched case, the neccessity to use iTunes software, and no carrying case or radio. Not to mention the price!\nWell, it just happens that this iRiver eliminates all of those things plus throws in a voice recorder (that I will never use but it's cool to have!).\nThis player is so easy. You simply plug it in, your computer recognizes it as a drive, and you simply drag and drop music to it. It's that easy. No messy interfaces, no iTunes, no Musicmatch. If you can use Windows Explorer, you can use this.\nThe sound is good, with one exception. If you are listening in a quiet room, you can hear the harddrive moving through the headphones. It sounds like a bit of static from a radio station. It is annoying, but it's not bad, especially if there is any other background noise. I only notice it between songs, or when the song goes silent for a second.\nOther then that, this is perfect. The case is really nice, the remote is cool, and it is very easy to use. And the battery life is awesome! I've used it for eight hours and my battery is only half gone. And this is a lithium polymer battery as opposed to a lithium ion. Which means two things, one the battery life is longer, and two, the recharge capacity is 3000 times as opposed to 300 times. On, one more thing, you can also charge it at any time as opposed to only when it's dead. There is no ""memory"" fuction with the polymer battery. It might not look quite as cool as the iPod (although it still looks cool), but the battery itself is reason to buy this over the iPod, especially if you are a Windows user.";This thing is perfect!!
58;60.0;5.0;8.0;629;I just recieved my iHP-120 yesterday and it's everything I ever hoped for.  This is my first hard drive mp3 player, and a couple people I know own iPods and I've used them and I was pretty impressed.  But even with the iPod's touch scroll wheel and its stylish look, I still went with the iHP-120 for several reasons.\n1) My computer doesn't have a firewire port so if I wanted to purchase an iPod, I would have to buy an additional USB 2.0 cable.  The iHP already includes the USB 2.0 cable (USB 2.0 is faster than firewire anyways)\n2) At the time, Amazon was running its sale on the iHP for ... after rebate, which is the same price as the iPod 15GB, so an extra 5GB for the same price?  oh yes....\n3) It includes a voice recorder which is convenient for me because I can record those boring lectures and listen to them later, or record other things and play around with it.\n4) The iHP comes with the slick LCD remote, the only hard drive mp3 player to do so at this time.\n5) And finally, as you probably already read, the iHP has double the battery life as the iPod and lasts longer in the long run because of its lithium polymer battery as opposed to the lithium ion batteries used in all other hard drive mp3 players.\nAs for the iHP unit itself, it is easy to connect to the computer (XP users don't even need to install any drivers as the computer will automatically recognize the iHP as an external hard drive and you can just drag-and-drop your files into the iHP.)  I had no trouble scrolling through my songs in the root directory.  I am not an audiophile, but to me the sound quality is great.\nIn conclusion, I chose this player because it was a greater value at its price compared to the iPod.  If you want style and simplicity, or you're an Apple-lover, go for the iPod.  The iHP has a little less style, but so many more features than the iPod.;Awesome iPod alternative, if not a complete replacement!
59;75.0;5.0;6.0;634;"Positives\n-Slick LCD remote. You control EVERY function of the play using that tiny thing\n-Amazing SRS/Trubass system. You can clearly hear the difference in sounds. It does a great job of emphasizing bass.\n-Directory/File System (Drag and Drop) and a database mode\n-One button that controls almost everything\n-USB 2.0 = FAST\n-Microphone/Recording ability\n-LONG battery life\n-Nice leather case\n-Its amazing to use once you get used to the functions and learn to add songs and create playlists\nNegatives\n-Somewhat of a learning curve. When you try to add songs into the database, you'll get ""Failure"" errors and ""No DB"" errors. You have to search through all your songs to fix them manually. Failure occurs when your song name is too long, and NoDB shows up when your ID3 tags aren't the correct version.\n-Playlists don't work unless you manually edit them using notepad to delete the directory. For example it would say ""H:\Music\Pop\xxx.mp3. I needed to delete the ""H:\"" part to get things to work. I used Winamp5 to create playlists.\n-Wires get out of hand. The combined length of the Remote cord and the Headphone cord creates a mess.\n-No extra stuff. The ipod comes with games and news\nThe largest negatives can be solved within a day of using it. Its a great player that can match up to any other HD based player. 20GB isn't the cheapest on the market, but it is small, packed with functionality and amazing sound this deal cannot be beat.";Definately a GREAT buy
60;8.0;5.0;44.0;635;"Like a lot of other reviewers here, I did a ton of research on the hard-drive MP3 players currently on the market.  If you take nothing away from all this information overload, realize this:\nBE CAREFULL BUYING AN MP3 PLAYER!!!\nThere are so many details regarding the players on the market, and so many problems/annoyances.  If you (like a lot of us) are going to be archiving your CD collection onto your PC and hoping to have access to it via a portable player, that's a lot of time and effort to put into a project - the player you buy can really screw you in the end.\nSo, for example, iPods have short-lived batteries that cost a lot to replace.  They also don't have a built-in line-out (it's on the Dock, which you may or may not get and would have to schlep around).  You must run Apple software to transfer the files and some people have problems (I've always had mixed feeling about running Apple software on a PC).  Their sound quality is undocumented and puzzling.\nCreative Labs units require special (and poorly written) transfer software.  One of their units even forgets what song you last played, forcing you to renegotiate the playlist EVERY TIME!  The standard Jukebox units are actually pretty feature rich, but they are HUGE compared to iPod and iRiver.  Archos units are also big, cheaply made, and offer mediocre sound quality.  Rio units are buggy and have battery problems.\nOn and on and on.\nThis iRiver player was designed by people who use their grey matter.  After reading the manual (RTFM people, it ain't that hard), transfering my music collection, and using the unit for the past couple of days, I can tell you that it has NONE of the annoyances/problems the other units seem to all have.  It's a nicely made: feels totally solid, small and light.  Of course, these units are new so I guess the jury is still out regarding long-term reliability.  Still, you get the sense the unit is going to last.\nI must disagree with some of the other reviewers: the unit is not at all complicated to use.  In fact it was almost too easy - I had all my music on the unit in about 20 minutes, and started playing in less than an hour.  The controls are very intuitive, allowing you to sort your music either by directory or tag information (EXTREMELY HANDY since not all of my MP3's have good tag info). (Oh, and a warning: watch out for hidden files that Windows Media Player puts in your music folders, specifically ""desktop.ini"" files and JPEGs of album art, none of which do you want to transfer to your MP3 player!)  I was almost dissapointed that the thing didn't require more tweaking!\nThere are just so many signs that iRiver really has its act together. I'm pretty sure iRiver is the ONLY company to use the new Lithium/Polymer batteries.  The batteries don't suffer from charging memory!  Charge it as often as you want, and you don't ever have to discharge it for ""battery conditioning"" - it doesn't need it.  The battery is supposed to last 4-5 years (That's 3X the longevity of iPod batteries) and iRiver states on their website that they will replace the battery FOR FREE if it doesn't last about that long.\nThe unit I got even came with the latest firmware.  I checked and realized I didn't even have to upgrade it.\nBottom line: Buy one of these iRiver players!  The technology is so good, it just gets out of your way.  I'm looking forward to getting much better aquainted with my music collection.";Extremely Pleased . . .
61;34.0;5.0;13.0;642;If you have read the other reviews of this power-house here and elsewhere, you already know its one super-buy. And if you are looking to convince yourself about whether to go the apple ipod way or the iriver way, no amount of reviews will have you convinced. These two are, simply put, masterpieces.\nThe iriver ihp120 however, is much more than just an mp3 player. I don't honestly think a normal person can figure out which player sounds better than the other. But then, there is more to audio than just hearing mp3s. I have a cool digital camera, a PDA and a few other nifty gadgets. The ihp120 however, gives me the opportunity to capture the audio experience. While that might not appeal to you directly, consider this:\n1. Want to record lectures? You got it.\n2. Want to convert vinyl records/audio tapes to mp3s? The ihp can do it.\n3. Want to record something cute or funny or whatever else life throws at you? Thats exactly what this thing can do for you. WITH EXCELLENT quality.\nFor the first time, I have the option of capturing another one of the senses. Thats quite a lot considering we only got 5 [Well unless you got the 6th...but then that 6th sense would tell you to buy the ihp120 and you wouldnt be reading this :-)]\nTime to think out of the box folks. This is a way to capture well (very well from the quality of recordings) a whole new dimension of life. Too lazy to write a blog/keep a personal diary/remember that brilliant idea you forgot later...\nThis is not just an mp3 player people. Its getting more out of life.;Beyond just mp3...
62;70.0;5.0;7.0;642;Since all the positive aspects of this player have already been mentioned, I'll just take the time to delve into a few of the less mentioned slightly less glamorous aspects of this player.\nIn using it as a portable hard drive, I notice that the transfer rate for this device using USB 2.0 is actually slower than most other flash based mp3 players.  I capped out my transfer rate at around 1 mb/sec.  This ends up making the transfer of large files significantly slower.  Also, the physical hd of the unit spins at around 4200 rpm- so those planning on using this unit to back up files shouldn't expect 7200 rpm speeds off it.\nFor some reason, the scroll rate for the iHp seems a bit slower than it should be, and takes a precious few more seconds to get to a certain peice, but perhaps that problem has been addressed by a firmware upgrade.  Overall, this is still the best player on the market, offering all the functions/size of an iPod minus the horrible copy protection, added a portable hd capability, and a high quality fm tuner that I never use.\nSpeaking of the fm tuner, a direct record method to encode mp3s straight from the radio would have been nice too :);the insignificant other half to the story
63;71.0;4.0;7.0;648;"A lot has already been said about the iHP's features so I am not going to go through that again. However I want to add a few points about details that are often overlooked and that turned out to be quite important to me.\n- A nice plus is that there is not only a standard, linear equalizer but also the SRS system built-in. I found that the ""TrueBass"" is especially useful. This effect that basically distorts the sound makes the bass frequencies sound pretty nice, even on cheap earplugs.\n- A minus on the equalizer and SRS is that they are not active in radio mode. This makes the radio sound very flat.\n- Another minus for me was that the iHP makes gaps of about a second between consecutive tracks. If you convert a CD like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon to WMA tracks, it sounds fine for example on the Windows Media Player. However, when played back on the iHP the sound is interrupted with silence between every track. I know that the iPod has the same problem but I thought they had fixed it meanwhile in a newer player like the iHP.\n- Finally, I noticed that now, after about half a year, the black paint on the aluminium case is throwing bubbles here and there and coming off.";Some important details
64;13.0;5.0;29.0;650;"I couldn't wait to recieve this hd player for Christmas. After literally researching hard-drive based audio players for hours upon hours, I came to only one logical conclusion, the IHP 120. Cnet is a great site and I want to thank everyone that writes LEGITIMATE reviews, they helped influence my choice. How can 276+ people with the same product be wrong? After ordering the IHP online (from Mac Mall {thank you Cnet}, sorta ironic, huh?) for around the\nPRICE: of $344, I realized it was cheaper than the main competitor of the Iriver (Ipod of course-an admirable product).\nThe main factor in my decision was\nSIZE/WEIGHT: This thing is bursting with excellent features and is just about as tiny as the Ipod. As a 16 year old electronics fanatic, I wanted the best of the best. At first I wanted a Nomad Zen Xtra. I soon realized it was a slighty cosmetically upgraded technological DINOSAUR. The thing is simply HUGE. (Great price though, if you are on a tight budget and have to have a hard drive player NOW) I then wanted that oh so sleek and sexy Ipod, but I do not own a mac (although I respect them) and they DO have pretty bad compatbilty issues with windows. And if one was so inclined to do any pirating of music (Who on earth would do such a thing) it is out of the question. Bad battery life. Too popular for my tastes ( I wanted to root for the underdog of the hard-drive player market {Iriver} that can't afford to produce trendy televised advertisements and such). Bottom line for the Ipod- It is too expensive and can't compare technically with the obviously superior Ihp. When I took it out of the package and picked the iriver up I was like, ""Wow this thing is extremely light."" Yup. The pictures found online do not so this thing justice, you really have to see it in real life to size it up. This thing is TINY. This is obviously a major advantage/pro.\nFEATURES: Boy, I don't even know where to start. If you are reading this you already know of the optical in/out, fm reciever, internal mic (recording capabilities),etc. I am going to do something usefull and tell you how all of these thing perform.\n*The fm tuner is of high qualty, I live in Houston TX and the reception is great.\n*The quality of the internal Mic blew me away + the on-board MP3 encoding and options suite is beautiful. I have not yet used the external mic.\n*I have not yet used the optical twins, but their usefulness is obvious and need no explanation.\n*NO NEEDED SOFTWARE. Just drag and drop ANY type of file via explorer. Beautiful.\n*This player has tons of great features for a great price.\n*Navigational system is great / gets the job done with tact\n*Ogg Vorbis\n*UPDATABLE/UPGEADABLE FIRMAWARE. People, listen up, if there are any software issues EVER,\nMost of them can be fixed. All kinds of cool new stuff can be added/ All bugs fixed. Simply Beautiful.\n*Battery Life is pretty good (still much better than Ipod)\n*design is impeccable\nQUALITY: With the magnesium body, this thing is very scratch resistant (unlike the shiny Ipod) The body itself feels very sturdy and solid (no cheap sounding creaks when pressure is applied). The buttons on the sides are wonderfully placed and feel extremely durable. (they are in small ""valleys (indentions)"" so they don't annoyingly protrude.) The navigational joystick is a bit small but feels pretty solid. I read online that to make the joystick knob more ""gripable"", ( it is always really dry and slick, as if Iriver should have put rubber on it) you can apply a coat of fingernail polish overcoat to it, to enhance the ""gripability"" Anyways, it is of very good construction. Props to Iriver. The included\nACCESSORIES: kick A$$. The case is perfect. Wonder why there aren't any aftermarket cases? The case is flawless and serves every need for a protective casing. Earbuds are actually ok, I usually use my YAMAHA RH-5Ma's to listen to music though. OK, People- the earbud cord is short in order to accomadate for the length of the awesome IN line Remote. This is, hands-down, the best accessory. It does feel a bit cheap but it is reliable and is just awesome (blue backlight, 4-line lcd, does basically everything). A USB cradle would have been nice, but what are you gonna do? And the speed of USB 2.0 is amazing (and faster than firewire). The external mic is great for recording concerts, whatever. Tons of accessories, no added cost (basically). I would've bought this thing completely by itself for the same price.\nIf you are looking for an mp3 player don't get some dinky flash player, buy this product now. Period. (They just realeased the Ihp-140!) Go Iriver!\n""Nothing is without flaws.""\n  AtomzzzZ- 2004\nYes, even the almighty Iriver could be improved. Most of what you will read is nitpicky preferences of mine. (I'm slightly anal retentive)\n*The biggest dissapointment (that could've been avoided if Iriver were more specific online and in their manual): No Database support for Ogg Vorbis.\n*My hold button (I've heard others complain as well) is loose! It is just wiggly! It drives me crazy! This is something very minor and superficial and I heard Iriver  physically fixed this issue when they got the word. So If you purchase one, it will most likely be fixed.\n* I for one, prefer the Ipods scroll whele for two reasons: It does not protrude from the body and it is faster/slightly easier/cooler.\n*Don't get me wrong, I am totally for the Ihp line over the Ipod's, but the Ipod feels a little tighter, sleeker. (probably just because I love symmetrical electronics and the Ipod's lack of a protruding (not by much at all though- I am just picky) knobby joystick and the perfectly rectangular (prism) body as opposed to the slight downward curve under the joystick of the Iriver Ihp 120.\n*I haven't needed to call Iriver, but I have heard bad things";If you want a Hard drive player, read this.
65;35.0;5.0;13.0;653;I have had the player just over a month now and this is truly the player of players and definitely the IPod killer it is supposed to be.\nSome of the best and most useful features include:\n- Remote which shows almost all the information and all the control that the main-unit gives.\n- Firmware upgradeable.  Fix broken and add new functionality.\n- OOG Vorbis support\n- More than loud enough\n- Equalizer (preset and user-set)\n- No need for drivers, just plug it in and see it as another drive.\n- Leather case\n- Comes with every cable needed (except for Optical recording).  External mic, Stereo hookup, USB, headphones and so forth.\n- Lyrics can be shown in the display\n- Text-file support\n- Boot-time is only 12 seconds (I know others have mentioned 3-4 minutes, something must be wrong with their player)\n-  Plenty of 3rd party support and forums (search Iriver and forum in Google).\nWith such a great product there has to be a couple of snafu's.\n- Since the IRiver does not have a clock, it does not have a real random function either, and this manifests itself by starting with the same song every time it has been disconnected.  This could easily be solved through the upgradeable firmware so I do expect to see an update.\n- No delete support from the player.  Would be nice if you could just delete a file right on the player.\nBoth of these minor problems could be solved with firmware upgrades so I am not worried.\nThis is the player to get...  Yule Love It\nt;Doesn't get better than this!
66;24.0;3.0;16.0;655;"Ok so before the holiday season I did a lot of research on mp3 players, particularly Windows-compatible products (since I have heard entirely too many stories of Ipods and their awful customer service for non-mac users...).  Based on reviews and the product description the Iriver seemed like the all-around best buy so I got one.\nIt arrived, and I eagerly transferred all my songs onto it...only to discover that SONGS DOWNLOADED FROM MUSICMATCH DO NOT PLAY ON IT!!\nNot only this, but after spending a horrendous amount of time (upwards of 30 mins) on their awful customer service hotline on several different days to try and talk to somebody, I was told that ""oh, iriver products don't support files from commercial vendors in WMA format because when we built it, we didn't realize that the WMA files from online stores are in protected format.""\nThis seems pretty ridiculous to me; to advertise a player that ostensibly supports all forms of music, but then doesn't cater to the online services that have come to dominate the market of music sales.  Thus, I can only play those unprotected mp3s that I have, and none of the new songs that I have acquired through online services.  My player is essentially useless for new material, so what was the point of the $400 spent on it?  Nothing whatsoever.\nDo yourself a favor -- make sure the HD player you buy supports protected file formats before you make such a huge investment on something that doesn't do what you would expect it to.";Nice item - fatal flaw!
67;76.0;5.0;6.0;660;I got my hands on mine January 7, 2004.  It has not disappointed me in the least. After a very brief review of the manual(not even 5 minutes) I was loading my library of tunes.  I loaded about 6GB in about 5 minutes, and was charging the battery.  The navigation system is not that complex, I mastered it after about 5 minutes. It is pretty straight foward.  Scrolling through tunes, and menu operations is fast. The visual display is very nice looking, it is not hard to read at all. The remote is what I use to operate the unit. It is very handy, I just clip it on my jacket and stow the player safely inside my inner jacket pocket. I am using the supplied headphones, they sound good but are very uncomfortable. The sound quality of the unit is excellent. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The battery goes and goes, have not timed how long it stays on. The battery has yet to disapoint me.;Very Nice
68;6.0;5.0;61.0;665;This is by far the best jukebox player/portable hard drive out there. I got it last week, and i'm very impressed with features, quality of contstruction, and fantastic sound. The first thing you notice and really appreciate is that all you need to do is open the box, plug it into your computer, and it's recognized as an external drive immediately. No need to mess with complicated software to updoad-download stuff. Also, doesnt' have the propietary thing that Ipods have that you can only upload stuff into three designated computers. So, just using your Windows Explorer you do all the uploading-downloading-deleting tasks with great ease.\nIt works very well as a portable hard drive, so I don't need to burn disks with data anymore, to carry stuff from work to home.  I just put whatever files I need in my IHP, whether it's just a text file, or a huge amount of digital images and videos, the 20 Gig is a lot of space.\nTalking about space, I put about 70 CDs in there, and only used 1.5 GIG as of now, so no worry about running out of space anytime soon.\nYou can use this device to record from external sources, and you have an internal and external microphone option. This is great to record all those great songs that we still have on cassette tapes, and convert them to MP3s.\nI was very impressed with the sound quality of the internal microphone. You can use this as a mini recorder to record memos to yourself, meetings, classes, etc, and the sound is excelent.\nFor listening to music, sound quality is excellent too, and you can adjust the equalizer to your liking, for a really great listening experience.\nThe radio tuner is nice, and for stations that you get good reception, works well. I like classical music, and recorded a full concert from my classical music station, and on playback, it sounds very decent.\nAfter doing a lot of reading and research about which device to get, I decided on this one, and I'm happy I did.\nOverall, an excellent product.;Best one I've seen!
69;80.0;3.0;5.0;671;I have the iriver for about a week now and have the following bugs I need to have addresses:\nUnit:\nIriver 120 firmware 1.17\nMusic files: approx 4100.\nComputer: dell laptop running win xp (all updates and service packs installed)\nProblems:\n1. EXCESSIVE BOOT TIME: 120 taking about 3min 45 sec after turning on before I can play music. Takes excessive time to read DB/ files? I thought making the DB file allows dynamic sorting of MP3 via tags. This is not happening. Friends IPOD with about the same number of file only takes about 10-15sec at most to boot to playable position.\n2. SORT BY GENRE: sort by genre function is not working correctly. Some file show correctly but many genre directories showing as numbers! 01,11,20, 30, 98 etc. Note: The other sort sections sort correctly i.e. artist, album, folder, title.  This is frustrating, one reason I choose 120 was for the genre sort capability. Note: all genre tags on files show correctly in the following  programs: window media player 9,  winamp 5.0, MP3 tag editor, etc.\n3. IRIVER 120 FILE LOCKUP:  the 120 locked up hard during playback of MP3 file. Stopped at the 1:44min post. No button response. This is unsat and would be a BIG problem if no tool available to reset unit. File doesn't lock computer based MP3 player programs.\nOtherwise system works like a champ. Overall happy with unit. But the above problems need to be addressed and corrected. I have tried resetting and reinstalling firmware twice with same results.\nQuestions: manual not clear on TAG INFORMATION pg 42 of manual. What does this purpose of this function.\nPlease if anyone has the answers to these problems let me know!\nOverall I still like the unit!\nLawrence\nltdorn@hotmail.com;Iriver problems, Overall great
70;56.0;1.0;9.0;672;"I'm using an iRiver iHP-120 with OS 10.3 on a Powerbook G4.  I've had it for about 24 hours, and its interaction with the OS is an absolute disgrace.\nConnecting to the Player\nThe computer recognizes the player about 1 in 10 times that I plug it in.  To copy files to it, I have to spend 20 minutes randomly plugging and unplugging the cable and turning the unit on and off.  It came with version 1.17 of the firmware, and I upgraded it to the latest beta, 1.20, to no avail.  When the computer does recognize the player, it shows up as a hard drive and you can simply drag files to it.  It doesn't interact with iTunes, but you can drag your iTunes folder to it.\nFilenames\nThe player doesn't like the characters in many of my filenames, so the OS throws up error messages in the middle of copying files to the player and then stops its copy.  Nowhere in any documentation does it mention which characters are taboo.  So far I've found that it objects to question marks and quotation marks.  There is no rhyme or reason to which files are copied before an error message comes up, so I had to download a file synchronization program to finish up the job.  My strategy with filenames that it objects to has been to remove the file from iTunes, rename it, then drag it back into iTunes.\nID3 Tag Database\nThe player can filter songs using the fields in ID3 tags.  In order to do this, it builds a database of ID3 tag information.  You can only do this from a Windows computer.  Files with long names or in folders with long names (more than about 48 characters) cannot be indexed.  All the files can be found using the Windows Explorer-like directory structure if you wish to locate a particular one, but I prefer to simply play everything randomly.\nBattery Life\nOstensibly, the battery will last for 16 hours of play.  I have not gotten to test this due to OS X's refusal to copy random files with names it didn't like.  I did charge the battery fully and then take the player to work without the charger to finish copying files to it.  I figured that given the long battery life, it would last long enough to copy the remainder of my files (about 4 hours) even though the battery would drain faster because the hard drive would be working constantly.  Not so much; it died after 3 hours.\nSound\nI've played it in the car once; my stereo has a line-in, so I used the included cable to hook it up.  It sounded very nice, and my car is not known for having great speakers.\nButtons\nControl is mainly through a joybutton (think joystick but shaped like a button). Pressing it or pushing it up/down/left/right accomplishes most operations.  It's finicky about how it's touched.  I have small fingers, and it sometimes misinterprets the direction I pushed it in.  I'm adjusting and getting more accurate.\nThe Bottom Line\nOnce I have my library all copied over and I only need to hook it up from time to time to add new songs, it would be feasible to copy files to a Windows machine for transferring (for me, as I happen to have a few laying around on my network).  I chose the iRiver over the iPod because of Apple's evil battery replacement scheme, but I cannot recommend that anyone else do this.  Don't plan on returning it if it you don't like it -- you have to destroy the packaging to extract it.";Not for Macs!
71;72.0;5.0;7.0;679;I bought the first generation IPOD and have used it for 1.5 years. I can't stand the battery life on it. I would use the IPOD for 1 hr and then not use it for a day or so. Then, when I tried to use it again, the battery was already dead. Not good!\nI recently purchased the iHP-120 and I love it! It has so much more features than the IPOD and the battery life is excellent!!!\nDon't waste money on the IPOD. The iHP-120 sounds so much better and once you get used to the interface, you will love this device. The earbuds are so much more comfortable also. I am so glad I got this device. The only negative thing I have found is there is no on the fly playlist capability, but you can create them from the PC. I still have this problem w/ my IPOD, even though I know the new ones have this feature. Still, I would recommend the iHP-120 over the IPOD because of all the other features and best of all, the excellent battery life. Buy one today, and you will love it!;So much better than IPOD!
72;5.0;5.0;69.0;686;"I've been using this player and it's great!  Although there are many choices out there iriver did a great job the second time around (iHP 100 was the first cut).  Some of the features I like are\n\n**Remote - a must have since it's really inconvenient having to take out the main unit in order to change settings like the volume or songs\n\n**No drivers or software - needed to copy over songs - it can be a big headache when you have to install software just to move files over when all you want to do is a copy.  One of the reasons why I didn't go w/ Creative is due to their bloatware.  Since it looks like an external (toshiba) hard drive when you plug it in it's can be used for external storage.  There's 20GB and I wasn't able to fill it up with songs that *I like*. I've used up only 5GB so far.  The extra space is great for use as a portable hard drive.  If your computer supports USB-HDD you can boot from it too.\n\n**Upgradeable Firmware OS - The nice thing about this is that no MP3 player is perfect the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd time around.  having this upgradeable firmware allows them to add/fix features.  I've already submitted a few nice to haves to iriver (although I haven't received any response) such as on the fly playlists, deleting from the player directly, statistics like running time, clock feature, smaller fonts, etc.  I hope they'll be able to put this into the next firmware upgrade.  They're currently on version 1.17\n\n**Many formats - This can play almost every format (mp3,wma,asf,wav) available and even ogg!\n\n**Many extras - It comes with a nice leather carrying case to protect the iHP that has the holes for the buttons (although you won't use them often since everything is accessible from the remote), a very decent set of earphones, usb 2.0 cable, line-in cable, external microphone and a 2 inch headphone extension cord since the plug on the remote is recessed in a bit.  It's nice that you plug your headphones into the remote as opposed to the main unit because this accomodates short headphone cords like my sony fontopia earbuds\n\n**Solid design & construction - When you first put this in your hand you know they didn't skimp on the materials.  Everything feels solid (not that cheap and light plastic is a bad thing) and made from metal.  Even the glass on the remote is extra thick so you don't have to worry about pressing too hard on the lcd and breaking it.\n\n**Optical out and In - I used to store MP3s on my hard drive but now I store it on the iHP.  When I put it on my desk to charge I plug this into the Klipsch 5.1 system via the optical outputs and the sound is crisp and there's no distortion because it's digital.  The optical outs also doubles as analog in/outputs.  The leather case covers up these openings to keep them clean.\n\n**Many configuration options - (and many more to come) that can be accessed from the main unit and from the remote!  You can configure the equalizer to use SRS,WOW, TruBass and even can't the presets.  Even the scroll speed is configurable.\n\n**Sounds good -  The sound is also very loud and crisp w/ more than enough bass. It even has a feature that will fade in the song so that you don't get a sudden loud start in the song.  I've placed a request to them so hopefully in the next version they might have some sort of normalization between all songs.\n\n**FM/AM Tuner - The tuner on this unit gets great reception.  Because I live in NYC I have a lot of stations.  I have enough presets from all of the stations I want.  You can also configure different backlight options when it's connected to an adapter and when it's connected by battery, sleep time, fade-in,\n\n**Many repeat options - Repeat or random shuffle by 1 song, 1 directory, all directories\n\n**Crisp LCD display on main unit and remote - The fonts and display are very sharp.\n\n**Good battery life - I get over 10+ hours so far on a single charge.  I haven't listened to them any longer that so it might of gone longer.  After 10+ hours I still got 1 out of 4 bars left.\n\n**Search by genre, artists, album, song title - This feature is really nice when you have songs scattered throughout different folders.  I can say I want to hear all songs from <name of artist> even if they're in different directories.  This features requires you to build a ScanDB from the computer but it's easy.  You'll just need to right click from the computer the iHP drive that shows up and select generate DB.  This is the only feature that requires a driver installation.  Note: your songs need an ID3 tag for this to work\n\n**Song queuing - you can queue a song while another one is playing.  This is a minor feature but extremely useful.\n\n**USB 2.0 - This is really important when you're transferring over hundreds of songs.  Using USB 1.1 (12Mbps) it would take over several minutes to transfer ten 5 MB songs while it takes USB 2.0 (480Mbps) 10-20 seconds.\n\n**Displays non-english ID3 tags - This can display chinese ID3 tags.\n\n**Playlist support - It can use up to 200+ playlists (.m3u) so you can create a playlist of your favorite songs from winamp and use it on the iHP.\nSome cons although minor\n** Can't play music while plugged into the USB port.  This might not be too bad since you can play it off w/ winamp when it's plugged in.\n\n** Using the search by genre/artist slows the boot up time by 5 -10 seconds.  If you don't need this feature you can turn it off.\n\n**No docking station - not a big deal since remote can stand upright by itself on the table.\n** 20 GB drive - I'm sure there's a way to replace the drive with a bigger one but this size is more than sufficient\n** More expensive than most other 20GB players.\n\nYou can see all the time and effort they've put into this mp3 player.  Although some of the features are minor it is the time they've put into details that make this a great player. If you want the ""BMW of mp3 players"" you gotta pay ""BMW prices"". Overall, the feature set and quality (sound and hardware-wise)are perfect.  Most of the minor issues and features can be fixed with future firmware upgrades.  You can't go wrong w/ this! :)";You definitely get what you pay for! The IPod-Killer is here!
73;2.0;5.0;208.0;690;"Dont get me wrong...the ipod is great.  It is by far the best design on the market, but it does fall short in some areas and the iriver picks up that slack.\nI decided to look at brands other than the Ipod because most of my files are WMA's and i did not feel like converting all of them.  I did a LOT of research and got it down to two players; the Rio Karma and the iRiver iHP-120.  I went with the iRiver because it had many features that i was looking for that the Rio did not.\nI have had it now for about a month now and let me just put it like this:  the Ipod is not the only heavy hitter anymore.  If someone were to offer me either right now...free....i would take the iRiver.  Here is why:\nWhat the Ipod has over the iRiver-\n  -Cool design\n  -User friendly interface (scroll wheel)\n  -Firewire (although iriver does have USB2)\nWhat the iRiver has over the Ipod-\n  -4-line LCD remote so that you can see what is happening\n  -16 Hour Lithium-poly. battery (Ipod has a 6 hour)\n  -WMA compatable (for windows users)\n  -no software needed (shows up as an external hard drive. just drag and drop onto or from ANY computer without drivers. This includes non-music files)\n  -recording from any source (has optical in/out and comes with an internal AND external mic.\n  -music is laid out the way you want it to be because you put it on there how you want it\n  -FM radio tuner built in\nBottom line is that it lookes great, sounds great, has a great remote and lots of features that you don't see on most players.\nThis is not a review to say that Apple is no good.  I am just saying that too many people seem to go into the search with blinders on and not see what else is out there.  In my opinion.....the iRiver iHP-120 is, becuase of all the reasons i listed, the better player for me and i am very glad that i got it instead of the Ipod.  If you are a PC user you NEED to check it out before you buy.\nHope i helped.";There is nothing to fear about not getting the Ipod.
74;12.0;4.0;30.0;694;I bought this less than a month ago, and almost immediately noticed some problems.  First, it didn't let me shuffle through playlists or artists - only through lowest level directories and all my music... not so hot.  Secondly, certain ogg files just crashed it so that I had to use a pin/mechanical pencil in the hard reset hole.\nHowever, aside from that, I was very happy - it was cheaper than an iPod, worked on Windows, and Linux (with some homebrew software) with full support, and should work as a hard-drive just fine on a Mac, but without the music database management.  The ability to have a 20GB hard drive that I can plug in to any computer (more recent than Windows98) and have work is great as well.\nMy concerns, however, were largely addressed when iRiver, who seem to really take the philosophy of giving the customer what they want to heart, recently released (currently beta - soon to be production) firmware that fixes both these problems.  Not only that, but they added some other great features.\nFor Mac OS X users who want to use this and are adventurous, they might try compiling the Linux software (I've never tried it) on a Mac, or if they have access to a Windows/Lin machine, they can transfer files to the player from a Mac and then build the database on another machine, or simply live without the database - if your directory structure and filenames is well-organized, this is easy enough.\nWithout further ado, my favorite features/bugs with this very sleek product:\n- a portable 20GB USB hard drive is a really nice thing to have - only wish it were easier to find a shorter USB-to-mini-USB cable so that I could carry the computer connector with me more easily.\n- comes with everything you need and then some - a carrying case, which adds size, but can be kept on a belt and protects the player while still leaving it fully usable, power adapter, USB cable, a remote (which as far as I know is not standard with an iPod, and is very nice to have) and a pair of Sennheiser earbuds that sound amazingly good for earbuds.\n- the stereo line-in and internal mic are great - I've recorded concerts (with the bands' permission, of course) and lectures discretely, and I can save them easily.\n- the new firmware gives no problem with playback\n- no dynamic playlisting as such, but allows Winamp *.m3u playlists (which can be generated from many different programs) and when using the music database, you can select all songs from a given artist/album/genre.  With the new firmware, shuffling through these lists is possible, too.\n- scrolling using the joystick is *too slow* for large numbers of artists/albums/titles - this is probably my biggest peeve with the device - it scrolls through about 8 items every second, so in order to get to the middle of a list thousands, you might be scrolling for a minute or more.\n- aesthetically great looking, though the display can be too small for some people to read\n- built in radio is definitely nice\n- when the use of the database is enabled, the player takes considerably longer to boot up, but that might be impossible to change easily.\n- the ability to play ogg files is great - especially since it allows you to get more bang for your buck by compressing your CD collection to the smaller, higher-quality format\n- no docking station, unfortunately, and inability to function as a player while functioning as a hard drive, unfortunately\n- interesting features that I haven't explored much are the ability to read text files on the player's display, the ability to tag your mp3s with lyrics so that the player displays lyrics as the song plays, in sync with the music, and a language study mode.\nLuckily, the most of the few problems I have found are probably possible to fix via firmware, and since iRiver's reputation for getting firmware upgrades to consumers is pretty good, I have high hopes.;Sweet - and getting better all the time
75;51.0;5.0;10.0;702;UPDATE: I've had this player for over 5 years now and it's still going strong with great battery life.\n\nBeen using for a week now and am very happy.  Slightly larger than iPod in depth.  Other than that it is an excellent alternative to the iPod.  Battery lasts twice as long.  It's firmware upgradable. Supports many file formats for playback.  Windows treats it like an external harddrive so it may be used to transport any type of file. Has FM radio too.  Recommend it if looking for a large capacity hardrive player the same size as the iPod.;Almost perfect harddrive based MP3 player
76;46.0;5.0;11.0;703;The last couple of months have been the perfect time to buy a hard drive player with Apple, Samsung, Creative, and Iriver all releasing new models. In the end it wound up coming down to this and the Rio Karma. Since price breaks hadn't yet been put into effect on the Rio (which is now selling for more than a hundred dollars bellow list now) I decided to go with this.  I've had mine for almos a week now and I couldn't be more impressed. While you are paying more, you're getting a lot in return. It's one of the only mp3 player that comes with a usable case. If you want to carry it in your palm, you don't have to worry too much about beating it up because of its scrath resistant casing. I find it even more convenient to use the beltloop case. The wired remote with lcd (also a feature that no other company offers) clips right onto a jacket pocket or bookbag strap and makes it extemely easy to navigate without taking out the actual player. Controls are easy enough (although I might just be saying that because I've owned other Iriver products in the past) The bundeled earbuds are god-aweful, but so are every other player's (yes including the  ipod too).\nIf I had to do this over I don't know whether I would get this or the Rio. Both players offer boatloads of features. Whether its worth the extra hundred for advance recording features, a case, and a remote, I've yet to decide.;The best HD player, I love everything but the price
77;14.0;5.0;25.0;704;Well like many of you I did a lot of research and comparisons.  It came down to this unit, the Karma (way too buggy) or the Zen Extra as a way-distant dead last (that truly is a yesterday product).  The Ipod wasn't even in the running since it does not mate well with windows (do the research), and a real-world Ipod battery life of 6 hrs is a joke.\nI received the iRiver from J&R Music World at an incredible out-the-door delieved price of $353. The sound of this unit is far superior to the Ipod and the Karma.  The Zen was close but this unit has less of a noise floor.  Beware of Creative Labs's 98 S/N figure, as they don't say at what frequency that measurement was obtained or under what load conditions.  The iRiver unit has an audibly superior sound and what you can hear is what matters, not what a company claims exists!\nHaving the superior Ogg Vorbis codec seals the deal in superior sound at smaller file size.  The remote is my favorite feature.  The delicate hard drive of any of these units can be ruined if dropped (not always but it can happen) and having the remote allows you to secure the main unit safely away. This particular remote allows you to do pretty much everything and I cannot stress the safety importance and convenience of this feature!  The drag-and-drop windows support integration is head and shoulders over the Ipod, Karma and even the improved Zen's file transfer systems.  Finally, my research revealed that iRiver is far more of a serious company who stands by their product much better than any of the other companies.\nAt one point I kind of wanted a larger drive but then I figured I'm really only going to be playing my favorite stuff most of the time and 20 gb is plenty for that mission.  Loading up a player with everything you have really is a waste since you will only have to navigate through all that junk just to hear your favorites anyway!  As for navigation, it is not hard at all and a little time with the manual will have you sailing along very qucikly.  This is the one folks!;The Best  . . .
78;40.0;5.0;12.0;721;"Finally a workable pocket tool to play and record! Creative is stuck selling dinosaur recorders with an impossible user interface and the looks of an obese discman, Apple's ipod has copying restrictions and does not record, Rio's Karma is also a non-recorder, Archos offers crude MP3 bricks and set out to make extra money with ""downloadable plug-ins"", and Sony persists shoving their proprietary, overpriced memory sticks and dated minidisc contraptions (still no quick upload of recordings supported) down our throat.  Meanwhile iRiver got the message that consumers indeed have a brain and brings out this slick gizmo - the first serious ipod contender.  And they include everything you might need (mic, headphones, nice leathercase, headphones adapter etc.) in the box. Let's forgive iRiver the ""Made in China"" on this one.  What's essentially missing (please listen, iRiver):\n- recording: voice-activation and auto-shutoff; default settings for one-button-go! recording without having to fingerflick through settings for every new track; a recording meter and the ability to adjust the volume while recording\n- capacity: >= 40GB please! (like the ipod) - it's doable today, and in its dual function as a mini backup drive this makes perfect sense\n- a ""DJ mode"" to check a track via headphone while another one is playing via line-out, and a fader between the two tracks would be great\n- an image viewer or color display would also be fancy but are not essential\n- more thoughtful packaging - careful, you need good scissors and safety gloves to open this box.\nOtherwise well done, iRiver!";Finally a company on the right track
79;31.0;4.0;16.0;738;i've seen this player up close, and i peronally think it looks very nice, especially with the bright background.  oh and the remote control is AWESOME! you can pretty much control almost everything with it, so you can tuck your player away and all you need is the control, yes it'll take about a week to get used to using it, but it'll be awesome once you get the hang of it.  and i've done a lot of reading on it, i hear it has great sound quality.  It's kinda pricey for me so im just thinking of getting the iriver slimx550 for 150 at jandr.  but if i do end up spending the money for a hd player, i'd buy this one hands down!\n(...);gadgetguy

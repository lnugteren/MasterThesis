0;3.0;5.0;5.0;0;Another 5-Star item from Amazon!  My daughter is developing her skills as a photographer.  She recently was given a gift of a Canon camera and was told this telephoto zoom lens would fit the bill for her camera.  Low and behold, it was listed on Amazon.com at a tremendous savings for us!  This item has proved to be everything it said it was and more.  It has made a budding photographer ecstatic, and her parents very grateful because of the great deal and that it met the need of our daughter.;Another 5-Star item from Amazon!
1;10.0;4.0;9.0;59;For a $100 lens, I don't think I could ask for more. I use this for photographing some hawks that live behind my house as well as my friend surfing. The pictures turn out very well if you use a tripod and the zoom is incredible. Some other friends who are also beginning photography have loved using it as well when they tried mine out. It's a little awkward at first to get used to the weight/ length, but once you do, it's no big deal. It's not as sturdy feeling as the metal ones I've gotten to try, but overall, it does it's job (very well for the price). I am pleased with it and would recommend it for a person on a budget trying to get a feel for various lenses :);Just What I Expected
2;18.0;5.0;5.0;68;"First off I'm going to say that I bought this lens used for $100. I read plenty of reviews and most of them talked about how the amount of sharpness gets really low when you get around 300mm. This is true. From my testing, 75-200mm seems to be the sweet spots for this lens. I shot a few pictures out in the woods at 75mm f/4 of my Dad and the bokeh was pretty awesome. I also shot some pictures of birds at 300mm and it's just very unsharp the second you crop. The only way I've found to get good bird shots is to be really close to them. This is very difficult unless you're at a popular park where the birds are fairly used to humans. Here is a picture I took at 300mm and is only very slightly cropped [...] I was only a few feet from this bird. As you can see it's a sharp image due to VERY minimal cropping. It is difficult to fill the frame with these little birds let alone get close to them. Here is another bird at the same exact place [...] This was shot at 155mm, it was at Clingman's Dome in Gatlinburg which is a very popular place which makes these birds fairly used to humans. I put down some nuts right next to myself and it walked right up and took them and that's how I got this picture.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nTakes great portraits at 75mm\nVery inexpensive for what it is\nFairly well built for the price\n\nCons:\nYou lose almost all sharpness once you crop above 250mm\nThe zooming is not very smooth\n\nOverall, who would I recommend this to?\n\nI would recommend this to any beginner photographer who wants to take pictures of their family or friends that may also enjoying wildlife photography. This would also be a great lens for someone who doesn't really care much about photography but wants a nice zoom lens to sit on their porch and take pictures of wildlife from far away (birds, deer, etc)\n\nTL;DR: Overall great value, absolutely worth the buy.";Value
3;12.0;4.0;13.0;139;i needed a zoom for those times when i needed to get close to something that was VERY far away...like the other side of a valley, or 3 blocks away, or at the other side of the park, etc.\n\nin all these situations, I knew i'd most likely be outside in some kind of day light...so, as long as I'm not shooting at NIGHT, then I knew i'd be just fine. the aperture on this lens, like any kit lens, is not very compelling. but, for the price point, and for my lousy budget, this lens filled a need.\n\nI have my 16mm, 35mm, and 50mm lenses, all with f1.5 or f1.8 for serious video work, even in low light situations. so this lens made a nice addition for those other times when i just wished i could get in closer (and had the light to do it)\n\nSo, the actual mechanics and build of this lens: plastic, feels cheap, like a toy, auto focus is fidgety during tight zooms, but that makes sense for any zoom lens really. the good news, again, is the cheap price point.\n\nSo, this lens is great for say, a daytime/sunrise/sunset static shot, which is going to be A LOT of your shots. so you get your money's worth i suppose. I'd never use this lens for serious detailed shots, but hey, at least I have it just in case!;great for what it is
4;5.0;4.0;32.0;140;This is a cheap lens and it does a good job for the price.  The autofocus is noisy and when zoomed in really far it shakes the lens quite a bit. Because the aperture only opens to 4.0/f you need really good light or you'll get a lot of noise in your photos.  Honestly, though, I like this lens a lot.  I use it to take photos of the moon and it is fantastic.;You get what you pay for
5;4.0;4.0;38.0;196;If you are on a budget and on the consumer end of the prosumer spectrum, like me... and, like me, you still want a good, cheap zoom lens. This is it. (Save extra buying the bulk packaging version)\nNow, if you are more on the pro end of the prosumer spectrum, you probably know to look for a lens with USM and IS.\nIf you buy this lens, be aware that you'll have to use your tripod in low light situations... there's no IS on this lens.\nIt's a lens best used outside with plenty of day light, hey... it's an f/4-5.6, so no surprise there.\nGood glass though, I've achieved better pictures with this lens than the with the 35-80 which is also f/4-5.6;Good Beginners Zoom
6;9.0;4.0;21.0;202;"Bottom line up front:  A very good, if underrated, telephoto zoom lens.  Highly recommended for beginner to intermediate photographers.  Best choice for the second lens you purchase.\n\nThe Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM should be a strong contender for the second lens you own for your Canon DSLR camera.  Your first lens was probably a kit lens, typically a standard zoom lens that has a range starting around 20mm and goes to around 80mm, give or take a bit.  You've enjoyed that lens, but you're looking for something else...something with more distance, something you can really zoom in to see the action.  You want a telephoto lens.  (You're also probably wanting a wide angle zoom lens, something that will pull in that grand vista in front of you...that's a different review, but also a good choice for a second or third lens).\n\nSo you start looking at all the different lenses out there, trying to find the best one for your money so you can take those photos you've been dreaming of taking.  But it gets confusing.  So many numbers.  You're just starting out, and you're wanting to make art, not do math problems!  And so many different opinions!  What is best?\n\nSo here's my two cents.  It's biased, like everyone else's opinions here, but I'll try to tell you what I'm thinking and why.\n\nFirst, pick a lens that goes with your camera.  If you own a Canon camera, in the long run you'll be happier with Canon lenses.  I've owned a few other brands for my Canon cameras, but they've sometimes disappointed me.  Canon lenses usually don't.  There are several reasons for this, but the most practical is that your camera is a system.  The Canon camera ""talks"" electronically to the Canon lens and the Canon flash best, so if you're using *any* automatic settings, you'll get the best results using Canon products.  You *can* get just as good of photos using different lenses and different flashes...but you have to do all the work of communicating with the system by using manual settings.  Not a problem if you know what you're doing, but if you're new...you'll want to use Canon products to help with the workload and learning curve.  Even if you're experienced, it just makes everything significantly easier.  So, I'm biased there, but you at least know where I'm coming from.  My wife calls it ""lazy,"" I prefer to call it ""efficient.""\n\nNext you need to think about what you want to do with the lens.  Since you're looking at this lens, you're probably thinking you want something that will give you the ability to take photos of things far away, or at least make something that looks small look a lot bigger in your photo.  A telephoto lens will do this.  For me, at least, this was the perfect second lens option.  Getting futher away from things usually was easier than getting closer, especially with wildlife.  So what kind of telephoto do you need?  For most folks starting out, a zoom telephoto (as opposed to a prime focus telephoto) is a better option...it allows you to zoom in and out, and better frame the photo you'll take.  So you'll be looking for a lens that shows a range of focal lengths (say, picking some random numbers....75mm-300mm).  The trade-off is that you'll have larger focal ratio (f-stop, f-number...it's called lots of things), which means you'll need longer shutter speeds but that's going to hold true for all zooms.  Image stablization will help with that some, but in practice if you're using bright light (like sunlight) I haven't found it makes that much difference and it costs significantly more.\n\nSo that brings us to this lens.  It's an inexpensive telephoto zoom lens compared to other lenses out there.  It's no frills, and does the job.  It's also more light weight than most telephoto zoom lenses out there, which helps when you're holding the lens and camera by hand (remember, higher focal ratios mean longer shutter speeds...meaning you have to be more steady for longer).  Yes, there are ""better"" telephoto lenses out there...but you'll pay more for them.  And the big secret?  You'll not get that much better photos.  Don't get me wrong, I have some ""L"" lenses as well, and they're wonderful...but I don't necessarily get better photos from them.  I've had the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM lens for almost 20 years, and I've taken some amazing photos with this lens.  Why?  Because I take a lot of photos, so I have a lot of practice with it.  It also helps having steady hands (although being a doctor and an expert military marksman means I have some practice there) and/or a tripod, but really there is no substitue for practice.  That goes for any lens, but if you're new to SLR photography, a good inexpensive lens like this to practice with will more than pay for itself.\n\nTelephoto lens.  Light weight.  Inexpensive.  Good quality.  You can ask for more, but you'll pay for it.  This one does the trick and works well.  Great to start with, and the skills you'll develop will translate when (if ever) you upgrade.";Best telephoto lens for beginner/intermediate photographers
7;20.0;5.0;10.0;471;Very good for the price. So you need to buy a tripod, who cares. This is great for what I paid. Photography is an expensive hobby, some can not afford a $500 lens. Work with what you can get. I only have positive results using this tool.;Excellent.
8;11.0;5.0;34.0;879;I am not a professional. I am just a mom. 99% of the photos I take are of my children. Before purchasing this lens, I only had the kit lens and one prime lens. I wanted a lens that would allow me to zoom in a bit so that I could snap photos of my children playing without having to be right up on them. This is the perfect lens for that. I shot my son's first Little League game this past weekend while I was in the stands and he was in the outfield. I got some of the most excellent shots showing his true emotions, because he wasn't posing. he didn't see me right up on him taking photos. I can't afford a $1,000-2,000 lens so this was the perfect price and I have gotten tons of compliments on the shots. I even shot most of them on manual using the sports setting (I have a Canon Rebel). A lot of them were taken through a little hole in the fence.;Great Lens for Mom to Take Pics of Her Son's First Little League Game
9;37.0;5.0;6.0;930;"This is my favorite lens I own; one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's so much easier and more fun when using this lens to get up really close. I think the quality of the lens is great too.\n\nJust know, that it won't be great indoors because the lighting gets off; it's best for outdoor activities.";Love it! Best for outdoors
10;39.0;3.0;6.0;945;"Let's go back about two years ago......I was a junior in college and I had some extra spending money in my pocket. I pondered on what new and exciting toy I should add to my collection for months. Luckily I did not jump on any big investment right away and let myself research new products coming out. I was playing with a couple of my girlfriend's cameras (No I did not have multiple girlfriends at once, just multiple friends who are girls) at the time which is the reason I got into photography. At the time the Canon T2i was not even released yet, but that managed to jump its way right to the top of the list of things to buy.\n\nLong story short I end up buying myself a brand new Canon T2i with the f/3.5-5.6 18-55mm kit lens. I had a blast with it for the first few weeks and months. Until I began to grow into the camera and lens which I felt was beginning to limit my abilities. I began researching more online about lenses and what direction I could go forth. Immediately I wanted the Canon f/2.8 70-200 and I began saving for it. Realizing that it would take me summer after summer after summer to save up for one lens I ditched the idea. (I was still in the ""let's go out and get drunk every night"" mindset, so money was hard to save and come by.)\n\nAfter I managed to save about $300 I did some more research this time finding the Canon f/4-5.6 75-300mm. Walking through Best Buy one day I saw that they had the lens on display and I had to have it. Even though I had seen the lens advertised at prices well below $200 I bought it anyway. As soon as I got home I ripped open the box to reveal the contents inside....a few Canon pamphlets, a Canon warranty card, 2 lens caps for front and back. I was slightly disappointed to find no lens hood, but for $200 I wasn't expecting much anyway.\n\nMy first impression of the lens was that it was pretty heavy and mainly plastic. The only visible metal is when the camera is not attached to the camera; the lens to camera connector is metal. Attached to my T2i the entire camera had to weigh about 3-5 pounds. It felt like a 80% weight increase over the kit 18-55mm. Although it was heavy, it felt sturdy. It felt like if I were to bump into something it would not have broken, unlike the kit lens which I babied because it felt so cheaply made.\n\nPros:\n- Huge focal range\n- 75-300mm essentially becomes a lens with the focal lengths of 120-480mm on a Canon cropped sensor. I'm sure no one in their right mind has ever gone and bought a full sensor Canon dSLR and wanted to actually pair this lens with it.\n- Gives beginners a whole new set of tools to work with\n- Can effectively be used as a cheap macro lens\n- CHEAP\n\nCons:\n- Heavy\n- Slow aperture\n- Slow focus\n- All plastic except for mount\n- Noticeable halos around objects on the farther and closest end of the focal range (chromatic aberration)\n\nAll in all this lens will work for any beginner looking to upgrade and gain a greater focal range. I ran about 10,000 shots through this lens, from sports, to night time star shots, to macros, to landscapes, to portraits. It will do it all. Honestly looking back now I would have given this lens a 5 star review when I first got it. Now that I have seen and used some much nicer glass I can't give it anything more than a 3 , yet it is not a 4 so it will stand on Amazon as a 3.";Great upgrade for beginners with only a kit lens
11;41.0;5.0;6.0;1026;I bought this lens about a month ago and was very exited to get to use it. For the price, it does what it says it does, and works great. The only let down to me was that there is no image stabilization, and considering the focal length of this lenses 75-300mm, it could really use it. And the upgrade to this lens is the IS 70-300mm, but i didn't want to spend $500 just to get IS. Other than that it works perfectly. The sharpness is really good if you're using lower consumer-grade bodies, such as the Canon XS, XSi, T1i, T2i, T3i or the T3. Any others above that such as the 60D, 7D, 5D or any of the 1D models, this lens would not be the right lens.;For the price, the quality of this lens is amazing.
12;32.0;4.0;7.0;1028;"I'm relatively new to DSLR photography, and this is my first non-kit lens (though I have tired other lenses in the store, I don't think that really counts).\n\nSo far, I'm very pleased with this lens.  The zoom is very satisfying...buildings a mile away become a useable size.  I'll just break it down into pros and cons.\n\nPRO- Smooth focus and zoom irises.\nPRO- Good image quality for most of the lens' range.\nPRO- Affordable\nPRO- Provides great zoom ability (75-300), ""completes"" the kit lens (18-55).\n\nCON- Autofocus is kinda slow\nCON- F-stop requires a lot of light when zoomed in around 300mm.  This would be true of any lens, though.\nCON- Images might not be that clean when zoomed in around 300mm.  This could be due to the increased gain or shutter speed, but in general I found I had to work a lot harder to get a crisp, sharp image when I zoomed in at 300mm (again, could be true of any lens, but this is the only one I know).\n\nUltimately, I'm really glad I got it.  I'm guessing other lenses are better because they cost more, but I can't comment on those.";Great for someone who doesn't know better
13;34.0;5.0;7.0;1158;"As of this writing there is a major retailer that has this lense for under $100.00, anyway this lense is excellent. People scream it has no IS, etc... It doesnt need IS unless you are shooting at very low shutter speeds in low light, and if so why are you not using a tripod? I took this out today for a test drive along side my 55-250mm IS lense, and this lense competes just fine with its IS cousin. Seriously unless you just have $$$ to burn on L lenses, grab this one today, especially as if you hurry you might be able to ""target"" that sale price that is under $100.00. :)";Excellent value foe the moola!
14;22.0;4.0;14.0;1301;"My husband bought this to expand a Canon T1i (dslr), that just had the kit lens. No, it doesn't have IS,(400 bucks for a Canon 250mm) no, it's not a (L) lens, (1,500 bucks). But for the price and the expandability it offers it was a good purchase. I kills me to see people pay 150 bucks for a lens, then bash it because it isn't a 1,500 dollar lens. We would all love to have one of those. This is a good lens for what it is, a manual focus on distant objects lens. One way to get around the ""hunting"" on auto focus, is to put the camera on spot metering. And if you want even quicker shooting, just flick the camera to auto, let it do the work. This allows the camera to pinpoint the focus on a single spot. It actually stays on the camera 80% of the time, with the lower 75mm rating on zoom, it's just a little closer than the 55mm kit lenses, but with the quick ability to go to 300mm. One of the reasons I chose the Canon was the ability to use older EF lenses thus saving money and expanding as I go. I still feel it was a great purchase and don't regret it at all.";A great purchase for the novice

17;29.0;4.0;9.0;1501;"I think this lens has gotten a bad rap simply because most people misunderstand its intended use.  If you're looking to get this lens, chances are that you've just bought an entry-level Canon EOS kit (like a Rebel XS or something comparable) and are now looking to move to the next step.  This is a good ""next step"" lens.  No, this is not a top-of-the-line telephoto lens.  However, if you just want a simple telephoto that is inexpensive but will get the job done, this is a good lens.  It's a good lens for capturing faraway subjects (like birds and other animals) without having to get too close, but doing this takes practice (with ANY lens).\n\nFor the money you spend, this is a good, durable lens.  It attaches easily to a Canon mount, and it returns good-quality images.  One of the drawbacks to this lens is that the AF servos are a bit sluggish; since most people use this lens for photographing animals, this can be problematic.  However, as with any SLR lens, this lens can be focused manually.  Although this lens is considerably heavier than a typical 18-55mm lens, it is still lightweight compared to most telephotos.  The zoom is very easy and quick to use, which will be helpful for bird photography.  One use that I have found for this lens is that it is excellent for pet photography if you have outdoor pets.\n\nIf you're in the Amazon trying to photograph the ruby-throated, only-ten-left-in-the-entire-world hummingbird for National Geographic, then you'll probably want to go buy a more upscale lens.

20;46.0;5.0;6.0;1564;I initially bought this lens in a package six months ago from the date of this review with my Canon Xsi along with the EF-s 18-55mm Kit lens.  I must say that this is a great lens and I have used it VERY often (possibly more than my kit lens).  Being one of the cheapest telephoto lenses in Canons lineup, not too much can be expected from the lens, but it does deliver many things.\n\nAs far as image quality, while it can be improved, it still takes great pictures.  I use it for taking pictures of outdoor sports and it has come out with some great pictures.  Using the lens indoors can be a challenge.  Because it is a slow lens, I always carry a tripod around as you will have to slow down your shutter speed to get your pictures correctly exposed.  Before purchasing the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II, I also tried using this lens for some portraits, and was impressed with the results. While it may not have the sharp detail as some other lenses, it can still take some great pictures.\n\nAs for build quality, it is light and plastic.  The front lens element does rotate while it focuses.  Its autofocus motor is not USM, so it is neither fast nor quiet, but it does work well and seems quite accurate.\n\nSometimes, our budget restricts what we can buy and what we can use.  In my case, I bought this lens because it fit my budget and have not regretted that purchase at all.  While this lens may not have the amazing image quality and build of other lenses, it is important to remember that it is your photographic vision and drive that creates pictures.  Even a great photographer with a toy camera can take a great picture.  Don't be discouraged by others who say this lens is not worth the money.  Buy the equipment that fits your budget work with it.

I don't care that it's noisier than the included 18-55 lens, and I've taken some fantastic fully zoomed in pictures with this lens, I have seen no indication of unfocused results...  If you're a ""pro"" and you are buying a $150 lens and expecting $800 results, you might want to revisit your expectations  :-)";This lens has been perfect for me
22;44.0;5.0;7.0;1672;I'm a serious amateur photographer who recently recieved the lens as a christmas present this year. I use it on my Digital Rebel XT and it seems to do a pretty good job as a entry-level zoom lens. I've been testing the lens out for about a month and I have essentially the same conclusions as everyone else: the autofocus is rather slow and clunky but I am still able to nail birds flying past me. The lens is rather slow at f/4 but I've taken some great shots at ISO 100 and ISO 200 by hand with it at 300 mm. I will say, I shoot in RAW and inspect all of my photographs at 100% zoom during processing, I can tell you that the optics of the produce a non-sharp image and tends to have chromatic abberation especially in high contrast regions. Even under the most ideal conditions at 250 mm, f/32 using a tripod, mirror lockup and the self timer with no filter, the picture is not sharp and I believe this is dispersion of the lens glass. I noticed the worst sharpening at 300mm wide open. However, the lens produces excellent contrast and the overall image quality is great. I love having the freedom to zoom in on distant objects. So it doesn't perform as well as a professional lense but as a amateur, I'm happy to have this zoom lens to complement my Rebel XT system.;High Quality Entry Level Lens
23;6.0;5.0;109.0;1754;I see a lot of bad reviews on this lens. I honestly can't see why. If I can capture a squirrel in tall grass 50 feet away, hand held, overcast and in the resulting image I can count the hairs on the squirrels face. The hairs are sub-pixel sized. In other words the lens out performed the sensor. There isn't any thing wrong with the lens. The auto focus selected the subject of the image, not the grass and quickly focused it. Even at full zoom the aperture was sufficient to shoot hand held at ISO400, under cloudy skies. So it's not image stabilized ... Boo Hoo! It also doesn't cost as much as a stabilized lens. You can buy a pretty nice tripod for the price difference between this lens and a stabilized one. Can you get better glass for less, maybe. You can also spend a lot more money and not do better. So unless you are a pro shooting in fast paced environments this lens will do fine. If you are a pro why are you looking at an entry level lens?\n\nSomething else to consider is that the USM, IS version of this lens is really the same glass in a fancier can and three times the price. If you want the bells and whistles go for it. The best value is here in the cheap seats.;Very happy with this lens
24;33.0;3.0;9.0;1816;"I should start off stating that I am a newbie at SLR photography, but with the basic rules underneath my belt of focal length and shutter speeds figured out, I decided I could graduate to this lens.  This is my first external lens purchase for my Rebel 1Ti SLR outside of the 55-85mm stock USM IS lens.  I had read all the reviews for this lens on here first and decided to take a chance with this lens.  I did not see anyone mentioning using this for aircraft or aviation photography, but since this was the least expensive lens, I took the gamble.\n\nThe lens fit my SLR fine and was simple to figure out.  My first test subjects proved to be impressive, and I think make a good case for this lenses strong point!  The pictures were of common household goods such as ceiling fans, my dog, etc.  It is good to know that this lens will function ""well enough"" for those purposes, but I noticed that it would hesitate, and not accurately focus.  It would ""hunt"" for the focus for a few moments, and only rectified by changing the zoom on the lens.  I wasn't too concerned here, as I specifically bought this lens for aviation photography.  I was not concerned with the lack of IS, as I keep the shutter speed fast for the majority of the shots. (1/500).\n\nAfter shooting a few hundred pictures today at the local regional airport, I came home to discover only 4 somewhat usable photos.  Almost all photos were either too soft, too blurry, or too out of focus.  Granted, I did use the auto focus feature on the lens exclusively, but the lens was taking soft photos throughout the various shutter speeds, focal lengths, etc.  I did intentionally vary shutter speeds and f/stops, but all ""action"" shots were blurry, including ones in the action shot setting on my Rebel.  Again, Even with the college class I took on photography, I'm not a pro and I very well may have changed a setting, however, with so few usable shots from today, I'm certain I did everything textbook.  I don't know if stopping it down would have yield any better results, but after doing all the tricks i could think of in the field, I was confident that I would have had at least a set of good pictures.\n\nI must state this, I was aware that the quality might not have been all there due to previous reviews, but as with I'm sure most of us, I cannot justify to my wife buying an L series 70-200mm lens (or better) now, and unfortunately after today's follies, I do not think she will let me ever take that step.\n\nBottom line, this lens would be great for close-up still life (flowers, portraits, macro-attachments, etc) but NOT good with anything of movement or at distances, regardless of settings.  Also, AF is garbage.";Not good for Aviation photos, but might be ok for portraits
25;54.0;5.0;5.0;1856;I purchased this lens a few days ago and have taken many action shots of birds and airplanes already and am very please.  I was concerned by some of the reviews complaining about the lens being slow to focus.  I did not find this to be a problem, however, it does on occasion decide to run the focus all the way one direction and then come back to the proper point.\n\nSome people complained that it randomly decided what to focus on.  To those people I say, READ YOUR CAMERA's MANUAL!  There is an option to select what point in your view your camera's auto focus will focus on and this is NOT a flaw of the Lens!\n\n  When I left my Canon Rebel XS in Full Automatic mode, it decides on the point.  Put it in a more manual mode, pick the point you want it to focus on, and it works fine.  See page 102 of the Canon EOS manual.\n\nBottom line, if you are stepping up from a point and shoot or don't want to spend $500-$2000 on a lens, this is a great buy.;Great lens for the price!!
26;30.0;1.0;10.0;1999;Don't touch/go near this lens. Any photographer with even a modicum of shooting experience will hate this lens. F 4 - F 5.6 is a terrible aperture range and will drive 80% of users completely nuts. Considering that the majority of people who use this lens will be first time DSLR users, it's almost cruel of Canon to push this product when they know you have to be Sven Nykvist to make it work properly.\n\nYes, this lens produces amazingly blurry pictures in any other circumstances than complete, unobstructed sunlight or using a 40,000k HMI or a flash (blech!!!).\n\nI cannot describe how much this lens sucks. I seriously thought I was going blind looking at the pics this lens produced. I even readjusted my diopter, re-calibrated my computer monitor, everything, to try to figure out why my Rebel XT (not a bad SLR at all) was producing such crappy pics. Then I examined the lens and voila. Sadly, some first time DSLR owners who use this lens will blame the camera!!! Then they will get discouraged and drop the hobby.\n\nPS: The 16-55 kit lens is not much better.\n\nMaybe if you're trying to re-create Penthouse photos from 1974 you could save on the vaseline and simply depend on the optics of this lens to create an utterly unsharp, soft image. At least the blemishes on your wife's face will be automatically feathered out.\n\nDid I mention I hate this lens? Save your money for the 1.8 prime (or the 1.4 if you can afford it) because the 1.8 is the best economy lens in the EF series. To get a great lens for the XT/XTI/whatever will be out next week, expect to drop 1000 - 1500 at least.\n\nI don't know how anyone with working eyes in their head who could love this lens.\n\nAlso, it's made of plastic and doesn't have a focus ring. W T F?!?!?!\n\nI'm sure the distance marks on the lens are waaaaayyyy out of wack too but I'm too depressed to even bother with a test.\n\nThere are ways to make this lens produce a decent image, if you accept the limitations of this lens (and there are many) and work within them.\n\nYou can create interesting shots with amazingly shallow focal depths but for traditional landscape/portrait photography, don't even dream about using this piece of junk.\n\nSorry to hate on this lens so severely... but seriously. SERIOUSLY!!!\nI can't even use it, it makes me want to cry. I stick with the 1.4 prime every time, all the time for my Rebel XT.\n\nCanon, work harder or create a EF mount for Zeiss lenses!!! PLEASE?!?!;Terrible Lens
27;8.0;5.0;108.0;2026;"For the price range of $150-200, this lens is the cheapest in the Telephoto zoom lens range Canon offers. The cheaper price is because this lens does not have a quiet-n-fast focusing Ultrasonic motor (USM) and neither does it have an in-built Image stabilizer (IS). Instead it has a comparatively noisier DC motor which is not quickest to focus. Also the lens exterior surface is mostly made up of plastic and appears little cheap compared to the USM version or the IS USM.\nBut in terms of picture quality this lens is not bad at all. In bright light with high shutter speed the lens performs at its best. The pictures come out sharp and clean (please check out the pictures I uploaded). In day light condition and at high shutter speed (1/100 sec and above), you can shoot really good pictures (even without a tripod). But I concede that in low light areas/overcast conditions/cloudy and evening light the lens shows its weakness. You will desperately miss the Image stabilizer function. But if you have a tripod then the lens works even in low light conditions and at shutter speed 1/30 sec or lower and an exposure of 1 sec to 15 sec.\nNow for the whiner's who have been complaining: When you see a Canon Telephoto zoom lens displaying a price tag of $150-200, what outstanding features do you expect in it? As I said before, this lens does not have an IS or USM, then how can you expect it to focus quickly like the expensive ones. Apart from the picture quality and the zoom capacity, it's basically wrong to compare the features in this lens with other advanced & expensive Telephoto zoom lens. Given its DC motor and as a Non-IS lens of course this lens is not meant for Sports photography. If you're a sports photographer then why be stingy and then whine?

This lens has a great zoom, and in good, outdoor lighting takes amazing, crystal clear, colorful shots.  I shoot mainly wildlife.  The detail impresses me everytime I get a shot back. This lens has made me love photography, and constantly strive to be better.  I do not use this lens in indoor or low light situations.  While I have never used a much higher end lens, I am very happy with this one.;Great wildlife lens!
30;28.0;5.0;13.0;2149;Let me say that I haven't used this lens in a few years. I am now using much more expensive L series lenses. I still have the photos that I took with this lens on my hard drive, however, and technically they are great. For the price of this lens they are remarkably great. Very low distortion, no CA and razor-sharp images. I am saying this after looking at pictures just this week, after a few years of honing my photo skills and my photoshop eye. I am very sensitive (some have said too sensitive) to defects that can only bee seen at 100%-200% and I do not see any in the pictures taken with this lens. I have seen many when looking at the pictures from the 85mm f1.8 lens, for instance.\n\nThe lens was mated with a Rebel XT when I took those pictures, incidentally, which frankly it is meant to be. This is not a lens to be mated with a semi-pro or pro body. I'm not sure what the results would be there. They would probably be pretty good with a 40D but with a 5D I don't know. Again with the Rebel they were great, and I think given the cost of this lens it is meant for a camera like the Rebel. For the price this really can't be beat if you are shooting with a Rebel, Rebel XT or Rebel XTi. 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more. It is supposed to be a competent lens for a low price and it ends up being a great lens at a low price.;Undeserved negativity.
31;57.0;5.0;5.0;2248;My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets.  We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.;Great! -This lens took action shots.

It is not an L lens, but it costs a tiny fraction of the price. Note that this lens does not have any image stabilization. An almost identical lens with the simpler USM autofocus, was the first commercial IS lens, it is great, but costs at much as 4X the price.

42;1.0;3.0;1700.0;3061;"No it's not especially if you take into account its intended users. If you use a Canon digital SLR and are satisfied with the kit lens (18-55) then buying this lens can be the perfect next step for you. Practically speaking, you will be able to increase your zoom reach to the point where you can A) photograph birds in moderately distant trees, B) be able to zoom in on the other side of a valley and frame something of your interest. Those are just two examples. One thing you will NOT be able to do effectively with this lens, however, is to take sport shots with it. How so? Consider some of the following weakness:\n\n*At 300mm zoom range the highest aperture is limited to 5.6 (You will have to use very slow shutter speed to snap fast action shots; remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed.)\n\n*The lens size/weight combination makes it hard to hold steady when attached to a camera like the Rebel XT\n\n*Slow and often inaccurate auto focus (I just don't understand why Canon makes a USM version of this lens for $20 more, but never includes it in the triple rebate program)\n\n*Chromatic aberration is significant in high contrast lighting like in full sun (if you do not know what Chromatic aberration means search the term online or check out my review of the Canon 28mm 2.8 on Amazon, but to summarize, it would be a discoloration at the fringes of objects in your picture)\n\nThose kinds of weakness will limit your ability to use this lens in all sorts of other situations/circumstances. As a practical rule to follow, if the lighting is less than ideal this lens will give you a hard time. Meaning, it will be possible to use it, but you may get too many blurry images because of shake from slow shutter speeds. As for what are ideal lighting conditions? That would be full sun with few or no clouds and with the light bathing your subject/object from the front or the side.\n\nSo is this lens that bad? Not really, as with many other lenses, when the lens is coupled with a good camera it still out performs most Point and Shoot cameras. Plus it provides results at par or slightly below the kit lens (18-55). So if you are satisfied with your kit lens, which provides you with a zoom range comparable to 3X zoom (55/18= 3), why not add another lens that will expand your zoom range by another 4X (300/75=4)? Nothing wrong with expanding your horizon!\n\nPS. TWO MORE POINTS ABOUT USING THIS LENS: First, if you're confident you can handhold this lens at slow shutter speeds (I know I can't) then the low maximum aperture shouldn't be a major problem. Second, if you're fine shooting at high ISO (more like 400 or 800) then again the low maximum aperture shouldn't be a problem. The nice thing about photography is that you can do one thing in so many ways, so don't be afraid to explore with this lens!";Is this lens as bad as some people say it is?

Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version.;A Paper Lens
44;36.0;4.0;11.0;3105;Be careful when you use this lens because it does not have IS (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. This is why the lens is so cheap. This is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. If you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. This goes for any lens, but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod.\n\nIt's common sense, but I've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards.;Shaky Hands

46;38.0;3.0;11.0;3148;I tried this lens out when looking for a low-cost telephoto lens for my Digital Rebel XT, side-by-side with the USM version, the IS version, and several L-series lenses in similar focal lengths (the latter being but a pipe dream and way out of my budget at the time).\n\nIn short, if you want a lens with a long reach and have next to nothing to spend, this might be the lens for you.  I'd suggest spending the extra money on the USM version for the slightly-faster focusing--it's really just a pittance more, unlike the IS lens (although not appreciably sharper than this lens).\n\nPhotos are remarkably soft, particularly toward the 300mm end.  If you want this lens for nature and sports photography, be prepared for a lot of work in Photoshop to get something sharp enough to use (and forget about professional-quality prints).\n\nThe focus is very slow, and the lens itself rather slow throughout its range--and particularly at 300mm, where you're going to be locked into f5.6.  This means longer exposure times and/or requires better lighting, which limits its usefulness for capturing action at any distance.\n\nPersonally, I'd save up a bit more or else rent a better lens if you immediately need something in this focal range.  However, if you're okay with the softness--perhaps you're only doing portraiture and want to put your camera halfway across the room?--and can deal with the other limitations, the lens is very affordable.;Pay for cheap, get cheap...
47;40.0;3.0;11.0;3281;I bought this last year for bird shooting and was disappointed.  The photos came out unsharp and blurry even when using a tripod. Full stop down is bad, but it's alright at 200mm.\n\nI cannot recommend this camera unless you are really unfussy about optical quality. It does have a good price tag on it. Rating is really 2.5.;You get what you pay for
48;59.0;5.0;5.0;3283;The lens is clear and easy to use.  I have not encountered any problems.  I took it on a long (over a month) trip where it was subjected to rough treatment and extreme weather.  It came through with flying colors.  Rock solid.;Clear and easy to use
49;60.0;5.0;5.0;3304;I bought this lense nine month ago on amazon for my canon rebel k2. Its a lense for shoot pictures at ball games, landscrape, and parks. Sometimes its a little in foucing. If your looking for a faster lense its the 100-400mm by Opteka also from amazon.;Great lense
50;53.0;5.0;7.0;3322;This is a much better lens than should be expected for this price.  I've had no problems with it, and have taken many great photos that would have been impossible without a zoom lens.\n\nA zoom lens is a must have for every camera bag, and this is an extremely versatile and powerful option.  I recommend this lens highly, especially to ameteur or intermediate photographers.\n\nIt's basic, but it does what it says.  It zooms smoothly, focuses quickly (usually), and takes high quality photos.\n\nThe ability to capture people in their relaxed states without sticking your lens in their face is priceless for great portraits.\n\nI mean, it's a Canon 75-300mm for less than $200!  I couldn't even find a knock off brand that cheap.  Buy it already!;great lens, unbeatable price
51;21.0;5.0;25.0;3645;"No complaints so far with this lens. Using it on my EOS 300. Great looking, sharp images at the lower zoom rates and completely acceptible and actually pretty darn good images at fullest zoom. With my testing so far it's plenty fast as long as you use a tripod at the longest zoom lengths. No prob for me since I most always use a tripod while photographing.\n\nHave not experienced the lens extending out fully when aimed downward like others have. I'd even have to say mine feels ""quite right"" in terms of resistance on the zoom ring.\n\nBottom line, this lens is great deal at this price!!!!! If you can spend more get the IS model or some L glass .....I can't!";Can you really do better for the money?
52;26.0;4.0;22.0;4094;I bought this lens for my Rebel 2000 camera and have been very pleased with the results.  I never use autofocus, but the AF feature when I played with it was very fast and accurate.  I got the best pictures by using an all-around 800 Max film with this lens.;Excellent Lense
53;2.0;3.0;364.0;4593;I have Canon's 75-300mm lens for almost a year and have examined it inside out. Unfortunately, I cannot admit that it's a good lens.\nFirst of all, it doesn't have USM (Ultra Sonic Motor) and though having built-in AF motor, it is anyway VERY slow. And since telephoto lenses in general are for capturing high-speed events (like sport, running animals etc), its low-speed focusing makes it no good.\nSecondly, its light-factor is quite low (4.0 for 75mm and only 5.6 for 300mm) what forces you to use either high-speed film (not lower than ISO400) or to shoot in the bright light (what's not possible everytime you shoot).\nAnd the last, but not less important thing. I'm not good in mechanics, but what I know for sure is that Canon's 75-300mm lens produce unsharp pictures. No matter if you use a tripod or not, the pictures still are very unsharp which is very bad for images, being zoomed by 300mm.\nAnyway, I'd recommend you to buy the lens of the same focal distance but in another configuration: Canon EF 75-300 F/4.5-5.6 IS USM. Although it's a bit expensive and as you see, the light factor is a bit lower, too, it has an USM and IS (Image Stabilizer) what makes focusing drastically super fast and the pictures become more sharper with the help of IS. This lens deserves a high attention. But not this one...;low-class lens
54;7.0;5.0;173.0;4635;I'd just got into SLR photography and the first few months with the 35-90 lens that came with the Canon Rebel 2000 were outstanding.  I never realised there was SO much difference between a point-and-shoot and an SLR.  After reading p on some of the books about photography, I reaslied an important point was getting the right framing and getting close to the subject.  So I set out to look for a cost effective zoom lens that would give me that flexibility.  I tried the cheeper rip off lens in the loal camera store and found their mechanisms stiff and slow focussing.  I stuck my neck out for a canon make lens, and this one jumped out at me.  It's perfect, the shot are crystal clear, the zoom is smooth and the autofocus is just as good as with the smaller lens.  How do they make these lenses so cheap when competing lenses are more that twice the price?  highly recommended for a novice like myself whodoesn't want to sped too much for telephoto zoom capability.  I'm now looking for a canon 2x teleconverter to add to my range.;First Time Zoom lens

57;16.0;5.0;60.0;5064;"I bought this lens about six months after replacing my 20 year old SLR with the Canon Rebel G. I didn't think photography could get any better. It did.\n The first day I used this lens, I was shooting photos of a biplane plummeting at an airshow. Having been used to my older equipment, I thought, ""No way can I hold 300mm still enough, but what the heck, film is cheap."" I was wrong. That photo was crystal clear, and instead of a tiny blur in the midst of sky, I have a very clear image of the plane filling the frame.\n The lens has been responsible for getting me up close in many places since, most recently capturing Al Gore and his entourage on the pilot house of the riverboat that travelled the Mississippi the day after the convention. If you are looking for a versatile lens that gives great results under many conditions, this is it. It really is hard to take a bad photo when using it.";Makes every photo look like a prizewinner

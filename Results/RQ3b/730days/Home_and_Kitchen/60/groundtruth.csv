0;1.0;5.0;19.0;0;"I've had this machine for about 3.5 years now, and I've gotta say I'm still very happy with it.  I don't normally write reviews on things I buy, but today as I enjoyed my billionth espresso I thought this little machine deserves some positive reinforcement!\n\nA few things to note:  I worked in a coffee shop in my undergrad college town, so I had prior knowledge about espresso--what's good/bad, volume, time needed to make good espresso, etc.  I am kind of picky about messes--I hate them.\n\nThe good things:\nFirst, this machine has easy to use buttons on the front that are self-explanitory.  It's easy to use functions are definitely a plus.\n\nSecond, I like the tamper feature on the right side.  Not many people mention this, but that's just one less gadget I have to worry about if I'm using espresso as opposed to the e.s.e. pods.\n\nThird, it's setable volume control is great.  I love how I don't have to turn it on and off manually -- I can start it, and then walk around the kitchen getting my other breakfast items in-line, then come back to my perfect espresso.\n\nFourth, great crema.  I do not know if this is due to the coffee I buy or the machine, but I think it's great.\n\nFifth, two sizes of cages for the coffee...not sure if ""cages"" is the right word--but I'm referring to the fact that I can make 'single' or 'double' shot espresso with just 1 mess (assuming I'm not using e.s.e.).\n\nSixth, the e.s.e. compatibility.  Sure, other machines offer the same compatibility.  I will tell you, potential buyers, that these little mess-free pods are a life-saver for that hint of OCD in us all.\n\nSeventh, easy-to-clean parts.  The water reservoir comes out, the tray beneath the espresso spout comes out, and it's so easy to clean everything -- just throw in the dishwasher.\n\nEighth, the price is unbeatable for the product.  Fantastic value for the price.  I was thinking about 2 years was all I'd get out of it, since I drink a minimum of 2 shots of espresso a day.  Still going strong, and when this guy dies I'll get another one.\n\nNow, I should mention there are some bad things:\n1--due to the compact design, the water reservoir goes empty within a week or so...this can be seen as a pro or a con.  On one hand, old water can get nasty, but on the other, I don't like messing with filling it up (even though there's a hole in the top that I just pour water into).\n\n2--on my model, the steam wand wasn't flexible.  it looks like they've updated it.\n\n3--I'm worried about some potential leaking around the o-ring.  This happens if I'm not overbearingly strong when attaching the espresso basket when I use coffee as opposed to those awesome e.s.e. pods.\n\n4--I don't like the post-espresso leak.  BUT, I have figured what you do is just put your espresso cup up to the drops, and draw them out, this stops dripping.\n\n5--Noise.  I know.  I had to bring it up though.  Espresso machines are noisy, but I had to present this side of things.\n\n6--Delay from steaming to espresso.  If you steam milk for a latte, you should probably know there may be a slight delay if you steam your milk before you pump your espresso.  This is probably because the steam is somehow designated for the steaming, and then if you try to pump espresso, it has to re-route or something.  I don't know, I'm not an espresso machine engineer.  However, it's a little annoying.--solution is to pump espresso prior to steaming OR plan on a slight delay.\n\nEspresso Pods, what am I talking about?\nI'm talking about E.S.E. pods.  You can buy them online (probably on amazon) for around $40-$50 for 150 single shot servings.  They're packaged individually, and they're so clean.  If you compost, they are compostable.\n\nOverall, there's a lot to be said about this machine.  No real reason to listen to me besides I am a tightwad, and only buy things that are a good value.  Also, I like things to be efficient and easy to clean, and this machine covers that as well.  Furthermore, I like things to do what they're supposed to do; and this machine does just that.  Perfect espresso, perfect froth, and a great value.\n\nOnly one word of advice--have some control!  After you have your own espresso machine you might be bouncing off the walls due to the fact that YOU HAVE YOUR OWN ESPRESSO MACHINE!  Pace yourself!\n\nGood luck with your decision!\n\n***Update: July, 2007***\n\nI mentioned earlier that I was worried about the 'o ring' of the machine after a couple of years using it.  You know you need to replace it when the espresso comes out of another area of the portafilter instead of the intended spouts (like around the edges, etc.).  This will happen with ANY machine eventually.\n\nFinally, I had to replace it, which only cost $15 (it's called the ""group gasket"", and that price includes shipping).  Here's what you have to do:\n\nLook at the back of the machine and call the phone number.  When they answer, just tell them you need a new group gasket for your machine.  This is a very large rubber piece that covers more than what you'd think is necessary for the machine.  BUT, as I mentioned before, I'm not an engineer, so I just accept what it is.\n\nThe service dept. is terrible as far as their ""bedside manner"", but I will say, they know what they're talking about.  The guy who you'll probably talk to barely speaks english, and kind of yells into the phone (he will probably say ""you need to take apart the machine!  are you sure it is the group gasket?, etc."") but knows his stuff...\n\nThen, once you get it, you'll have to flip the machine over, and unscrew the basket.  There'll be an upside-down bell shaped thing that is covered with the group gasket, and you'll have to remove it (with a needle-nosed pliers).  Don't worry about ruining this piece, it's garbage.\n\nThen (here comes the hard part), you have to squeeze the new group gasket onto the upside down bell thing, and the surrounding surfaces.  This is pretty hard, but just inch it down.  NO MATTER WHAT: remember the repair guy sent the right size!  It seems like it's too big, but don't worry!\n\nOnce you get it on, put in the empty portafilter and run a few shots, and do some practice runs.  It will ""settle into place"" after you unscrew and screw in the portafilter.  The group gasket creates a seal that the portafilter comes flush with, so they need to get acquainted. :)\n\nSo, there you have it.  I was pretty annoyed with how hard it is to find the part, but I've done the hard work for you, so after 4.5 years of hard use, just plan on spending $15 to replace it.\n\nThe key is: No need to buy a new machine!  I almost got a new one, but figured I'd give this a shot, and it's all set.  I'm hoping for another 4.5 years, and more awesome espresso.\n\nGood luck!";Great espresso machine!!!
1;21.0;4.0;5.0;347;I received the Chamonix as a wedding gift in October of 2000 and it's still running strong. It's gotten a fair bit of use. For the first few years I'd use it an average of three to four times a week. However, I just brought it into the office and many of my coworkers use it, brewing several a day and it's still running strong. I'm very happy with the quality of the espresso and frothed milk and that's saying a lot, as I'm definitely a snob. The only problem I've had with it was an o-ring that wore out -- the one where the metal part of the frothing wand connects with the plastic. It's an odd size and I couldn't find a replacement at any local source, but I bought a larger on and whittled it down and it works great.\n\nIf you're in the market for a sub-$200 machine this is a great option!;Five years and still running strong
2;18.0;4.0;6.0;373;We enjoyed an Il Primo for many years, but we didn't know what we were missing.  This espresso is so smooth you won't believe it!  The unit is not as brain-dead easy as the Il Primo, but you will be rewarded with amazing espresso and meringue-like foam.  It is a bit drippy, like the other reviews said.\n\nEven in you don't buy this machine, you must get a unit with a pump and dual temperature control.\n\nSome additional hints:\n\n- Lavazza is fabulous Italian espresso.  It comes pre-ground, so you don't have to worry about the coarseness of the grind.\n\n- It has a slider for the amount of coffee/espresso it makes, but keep it on the lowest setting - after the first ounce or two, all you are doing is adding bitter flavor, all the good stuff is already in the cup!\n\nIf you spend more, I seriously doubt you are getting better espresso/cappuccino - just features.;Fabulous espresso/cappuccino - a little messy
3;10.0;4.0;11.0;446;I bought this machine used after searching high and low for a machine that was the closest thing to a high end espresso machine without the high end price. There really are few other machines with 12 bars of pressure for under $200 that get solid reviews (I paid $75 used). I'm writing this review because after reading a hundred of them, and then trying the Chamonix, I'm convinced that most of the negative reviews are the result of impatience or unwillingness to experiment. The first day I tried it, I was ready to return it - espresso barely flowed, it was weak, and the machine was a little messy to be sure. But after a few days, it's great. Here are some noteworthy things:\n\n1. As others have pointed out, your grind should be somewhat courser than for most espresso machines. If it's too fine you will not get much espresso to flow (as the manual states).\n\n2. Do NOT tamper the coffee too much. Once again, a hard tamper will restrict flow make you think the machine isn't working\n\n3. The machine is a little messy. Because (by design based on many reviews I've read) the grinds don't end up as a hard puck but rather somewhat watery, when you are ready to dispose of them  you inevitably get a little spillage from the brew head. Also, both the frother and the brew spouts are too short. You can't brew into a real cup and frothing means having to tip the frothing pitcher to get it on and off, but hey, do you want everything for $150? It produces a good espresso shot, decent crema, and is attractive as a bonus. Just be willing to play around with it for a few days for best results.;Solid machine for the price
4;4.0;5.0;33.0;861;"I've had my Chamonix since December 2001, and I love it. I use it for at least three shots a day, and I've only had to take the screen off for cleaning about once a year.\n\nThis is a great machine for personal use. Based on other reviews I've read here, I see that some people are disappointed about some aspects of the machine, which I'll try to clarify:\n\n-The frother nozzle is hard to clean. In fact, I don't clean it, and it hasn't been a problem. If you think about it, you have scalding hot steam coming out every time you froth some milk, so I'm not worried about germs.\n\n-You shouldn't leave the machine on for longer than you need to. This is not an always-on model like my rich friend has.\n\n-You cannot brew directly into most mugs; I use a small enamel cup. Shot glasses also work, but tend to cool the espresso too much because glass has such a high heat capacity. This is not unusual for espresso machines; most commercial espresso places brew into shot glasses.\n\n-The steam nozzle drips like crazy while you're brewing. I keep a spoonrest underneath to catch the drips.\n\n-You have to hit the brew button after foaming to let out the super-hot steam enough that the coffee doesn't get scalded (if you foam before pulling the shots, which I do).\n\n-The basket needs to be filled to the proper level. You should loosely scoop it about 7/8 full, then tamp it with the built-in tamper. You should get a firm but not hard surface on the grounds. If you can't press the top of the basket against the machine, it's too full. If the tamper doesn't make a complete disc on the top of the grounds, it's not full enough. This machine is not meant to be given a hard-packed pellet of espresso grounds, nor is it meant to be used with less than a full basket.\n\n-This machine does not produce a hard grounds puck like most machines. I believe this is because of the kind of filter/gasket combination is has to give a good crema. Therefore, when emptying it between shots, I recommend rinsing it in the sink rather than banging it over a puck can. I never take the basket out of the handle, and I haven't had any problems with it. If you grind your coffee right, it won't clog your kitchen drain. If you're getting a clogged drain from doing this, you're probably also getting bad coffee from too coarse a grind.\n\n-Don't let it run out of water or it makes a horrible sound. I've done this at least five times, but it's never caused damage.\n\n-The shot size is not consistent. I always watch the pull and stop it when it's reached the amount I want.\n\nSo, as you can see, this is not a pro machine, and I'd probably be annoyed by the above characteristics if I'd dropped eight hundred bucks on this thing. But this is an inexpensive machine, and you can't beat that with a stick for a pump machine.\n\nIf you see other reviewers that said this machine doesn't make great espresso, they're doing it wrong, and it's really not hard. You just have to not pack the ground so tightly.\n\nThis review was originally written in July 2004.\n\nUPDATE 10/1/06: This machine is still going strong after nearly five years, and I'm very happy with it.";Know what you're getting, and you'll be thrilled
5;43.0;2.0;5.0;919;I found the Chamonix to work quickly, but the quality of the coffee it produced was not satisfactory.  I currently use a cheap Melitta that makes a much better latte.  I used the exact same grind and fresh coffee beans, so this is not a problem.\nThe filter holds water and leaks when you remove it, and no cup I own will fit under it without taking the shelf off completely. The filter leaked the first time, so I started over with less coffee.  No leaking but watery coffee.  Further attemps with increasing, decreasing coffee and tamp pressure also unsuccessful. I ended up using my old machine and adding expresso to my mug to make it drinkable.\nThe frother is at a poor angle, I can't get any of my tall mugs under it without picking the machine up and raising the entire level of the container.  I tried angling my cup with the machine at the sink edge, and it was still not possible without spilling some of the frothed milk.\nI have shipped this machine back and thank Amazon for making it so easy to do so. I really wanted this machine to be the best I ever owned.;Disappointed in performance
6;46.0;2.0;5.0;1051;I got this as a gift and after two weeks I am returning it. I can't seem to get consistency from it. After reading the manufacturers recomendation of using bottled water and running 3 gallons to flush the metallic taste out, it still tasted bad. I never got the same amount of espresso when I brewed. The frother is at a very awkward angle making it difficult to froth the milk. There is also no cup included and a normal cup does not fit. I had to use a bowl to catch it. I am very disappointed that I have to return my christmas gift and will be going to Starbucks this weekend to look at their Barista models. Also if you read the reviews here, most of the positive ones come from the same reviewer. Many people indicated they had to buy another one 6 months to a year after purchasing this one. My advice, pass this one up!;Not worth the risk
7;9.0;4.0;20.0;1059;I've read most of the reviews on the product and am consolidating the views here:\n1. The machine is made of a fairly sturdy plastic (it does look metallic on the picture).\n2. The space under the brewhead is small. you need to brew directly into either shot cups or espresso cups.  These are not included.\n3.  It is NOT hard to clean.  The drip tray is removable from the main unit.  You can unscrew the nozzle on the capuccino jet.  The  filter holder has filter retainer so you can bang out the grinds and not lose the basket. Grinds due tend to stick to the brew head, BUT if you run hot water through the machine, it will clean the brew head.\n4.  The baskets are somewhat small.  You can barely fit two tablespoons in the big filter basket.\n5.  It is a little hard to use the milk frother because:\n  a.  the tip is about six inches from the ground.\n  b.  The length of the frother is about four inches.  So if you have a large frothing pitcher, you need to tilt the frothing pitcher to steam the milk.\n  c.  b/c of the set up it is also hard to move the frother in a circular direction.  there's not a lot of space.\n  d.  you should not brew espresso simultaneously with frothing milk.\n  e.  you should remove the filter basket when frothing milk.\n  f.  you have to wait about 1 minute after brewing espresso before you can froth the milk.\n  g.  you should also turn on the frother BEFORE you froth the milk.  This will eliminate any built in water (generally the first 5 seconds on my machine is water).  I put a towel under the frother and then i have a hot towel to clean my machine with.  Then i turn off the frother, place the pitcher underneath and then froth the milk.\n5.  I am guessing b/c of the price point that many people buying this machine are new to brewing espresso (I was).  Therefore:\n  a. you are brewing a small amount of liquid into a relatively large ceramic cup.  Therefore, if your equipment -- filter, cup, etc. are not warm, the heat from the espresso will warm up the equipment.  Consequently, the espresso will cool down.  (this isn't such a big problem with brewed coffee b/c the ratio of coffee to the size of the cup is so much greater).\n  b. You need to pre warm your equipment!  This is true of any machine!  This is easy.  Place the empty filter in the machine and brew water into the espresso cup.  Let stand to warm up the ceramic.  (this also cleans the filter head of any excess coffee).  Then discard water and brew espresso.  Your espresso should stay warmer b/c it is losing less energy warming up the cup.\n  c.  I have measured the water temperature in the ceramic cup at 170 F.  (espresso should brew between 190-206 F)  This could be b/c the machine runs a little cold or heat loss in the grinds or in the ceramic.  A better test is to stick a thermometer into a styroform cup and measure the water temp that way. I will report back when i have done that.\n6.  You need to experiment with the grind!  While grinding at home is generally better, I am guessing that if you are buying the Chamonix, you are not willing to spend a lot of money on a decent grinder.  Blade grinders (the kind of grinder you can buy for a Jackson) aren't going to cut it.  The inexpensive burr ginders (the kind you can buy for half a Benjamin) have horrible reviews on amazon.  So get a weeks worth ground at the store.\n7.  Still, i feel the water runs through the grinds too fast.  I think the goal is one oz. of espresso should take 22 seconds.\n8.  The automatic water system pushes too much water through.  More like 12 oz. at the highest setting, rather than 8 oz.  But, you can adjust the water level and you can manually stop the water flow.\n9.  yes, it drips a little bit.\n10.  I have not dealt with the customer service department.\nBrewing espresso well is a bit of an art. For a low end machine (and at this price, that is what this is) you get a decent shot.;Tips on using the Chamonix
8;29.0;1.0;8.0;1101;We loved this espresso machine until it needed new O rings (after only 5 months of use) which were impossible to find.  They were a metric size and virtually impossible to get a hold of.  When we called service they told us to mail the machine to them at our expense and they would fix it and mail it back at our expense and it would take 3 - 4 weeks.  We felt this was unacceptable for a machine not even 6 months old.  We bought a different machine with a much better service promise....and funny, it has never needed service after 3 years.  Save your money.;Great until it needs service
9;40.0;1.0;6.0;1198;When I was preparing to replace my little old braun espresso machine, I thought I did a good job of research.  I read many reviews, talked to people, looked at many different models and finally landed on this one.  What an improvement it was at first.  It made a controlled amount of coffee and steamed milk very nicely .  It did have a little water dripping from the steam wand when not in use, but the owners manual said a few drops of water were to be expected.  After  seven or eight months of once or twice daily use, I noticed that the steam pressure for steaming milk seemed to be waning.  Shortly thereafter, I noticed  a small steam leak coming from  the inside of the machine.\nI still make coffee, although it isn't doing that as well either, but I have not steamed any milk for a while and am looking  hard to find a new machine that will be more reliable.;One year later, it no longer works
10;51.0;1.0;5.0;1250;I loved this little wonder for the first 8 months. It was great! The cofee was strong and wonderful. It wasn't too messy and it was nice being able to make a single cup of cofee.\nOver time it stopped working properly. When I first made coffee it would leave the coffee grounds in the little hopper almost dry from all the pressure. Now the hopper is still filled with water when it says it is done. I turned it in for warranty repair. They didn't end up fixing anything - oh and they called me to let me know that they dropped it while it was in their care so the back plate was chipped.\nSo although it started out great - the fact that it didn't really  make it a year of use means I won't be buying another Briel product anytime soon.;Good in the begining - but fell apart over time
11;38.0;4.0;7.0;1318;This was my first espresso machine. In its price range, it's a 4-star product. (It's not fair to compare it against $300+ machines.) Thus, for what I paid it worked admirably. I didn't have any of the problems that have been mentioned in previous reviews. I would recommend the machine. However, you need to realize that unless you use an unpressurized basket and grind your own espresso beans with a burr grinder, you won't get even close to cafe-quality espresso (IMHO). The unit comes with a pressurized filter. You can buy an unpressurized filter from espressopeople.com for about $14. The one used for the Solis Crema SL70 works great. I also recommend the Solis Maestro burr grinder as it is ...the best grinder on the market under $200. With this combo you'll have good espresso with this machine, and very good lattes.;Good for the $, but use a non-press. filter and burr grinder
12;13.0;4.0;17.0;1425;I too was pleased with the machine during the first 8 months.  It blew my Krups maker away in terms of quality.  However, the espresso stopped coming out, even after descaling.  Out of frustration and curiosity, I turned the machine over and found a screw holding a filter screen in place.  I removed it and the screen was clogged with coffee residue!  I scrubbed it and replaced it, and it worked like new.  I think it had gotten clogged because I had used a great deal of oily Starbucks beans during the first eight months.  Switching to a canned traditional coffee helped alot.;a little cleaning secret...
13;32.0;1.0;8.0;1427;"I knew when we purchased this machine it would be a dream come true if it could last for any decent length of time.  In the beginning it was great but as time past the machine seemed to have more difficulty pushing the water through the coffee.  I've followed the directions to no avail, opening the steam valve over and over,  turning the pump on and off, even releasing the filter holder to release the so called ""air lock"" condition this machine seems so prone to.  Now it takes just as long as getting dressed and walking over to the local java house.  They may boast a ten year warranty on the pump but the bottom line is the pump is just plain weak.\nThis machine has paid for itself but the fact remains...you get what you pay for.  I am now contemplating our next espresso machine purchase.";Expected too much for so little.
14;44.0;3.0;6.0;1433;"We have had the machine for a year after a Briel Lido had  served us well for 3 years.\nBut the Chamonix frothing wand began to leak 6 months ago. I just put a cup under it but then I wondered, if the name of the game is pressure...? I watched the frothing wand leak ""at rest"" and when making espresso. Voila! The leak became much more intense in the latter state.\nCleaning (de-scaling) the machine seems to help but just for a day or two.\nThen I recommended the Chamonix to a friend. She made me an expresso out of her new machine. It was wonderful! Intense and tasty. I realized my machine was turning out something like gas station coffee and I had talked myself into thinking I was still getting true espresso.\nNow the pressure is on me to stop the leak (I have done the New Jersey Mambo once ... and never will again). But when I plug the wand, water sprays from its base. Nope. I won't be getting my full pressure or my good espresso back anytime soon.\nShopping again.";Espresso Quality Goes Down the Tubes
15;54.0;3.0;5.0;1435;"I liked this machine when I first got it: the shots of espresso were consistently dark and hot and had a nice layer of crema, but after a couple of months of moderate (at least twice daily) use, it developed a couple of annoying problems. The first was with the ""crema filter"". It got to a point where coffee only barely came out of the thing, let alone crema, even though I cleaned the filter often. I ""solved"" this problem myself with the help of a straight pin, and it worked fine ever after. THEN -- the frothing attachment literally blew out from the steam pressure, even though I had the ""steam"" knob full-off at the time. No biggie, I thought. I purchased a separate milk frother to take the place of the attachment. Finally, the machine quit working altogether after a little more than a year's worth of usage (and regular cleanings, too; I did take care of the machine). Unfortunately, the only thing the warranty covers for any decent length of time is the pump, which wasn't what failed.";Not the Most Durable
16;26.0;1.0;10.0;1503;I found that it worked okay for the first six months or so, although even then I thought that it was not designed well in terms of being able to clean it, and I was disappointed that the coffee came out lukewarm.  Started going downhill after six or eight months of regular use.  The coffee only flows out of one hole in the filter holder -- I have NO idea why, the filter holder is not plugged there.  So if you're making two demitasse cups at a time, one ends up with almost nothing in it, and the other is overflowing.  Leaks from the basket, and so bad from the steamer tool that I have to keep towels under it.  The coffee is only lukewarm, and the quick froth attachment doesn't flow milk through anymore, just steam (maybe one in five or six tries, the milk will come through).  Also seems very susceptible to air locks, which although they mention that in the instructions so it shouldn't be a surprise, it's still a pain.  I follow the directions to the letter, and have had others try it, and I descale it regularly and keep it clean, so I know it isn't operator error.  If I'm really desperate for a cup, I need to plan on a good half hour to get both milk and espresso, and then they're usually both cold by then.  It's just not worth it.  Service means an out-of-pocket shipping to New Jersey, and the reports I've heard aren't good.  I'm more inclined to just buy a different brand than to hassle with that and hope it works out.  If it worked as well now as it did the first six to eight months, I'd be happy.  I think it was just not designed well for long-term use.;Great when it was new, not so great now
17;56.0;1.0;5.0;1532;Worked great in the beginning.  We loved it.  It did everything that everyone says about it and more.  Great espresso.  Great being able to make cup after cup.  Then...  it broke.  So, I sent it back to the service company in New Jersey.  They sent it back after 3 weeks.  We made one cup, and then it broke again...  Oh well.  Luckily, we still have our old standby [$$$] Braun cap machine that I bought from Onsale Auctions a long time ago.;Avoid  - - Unfortunately...
18;36.0;2.0;8.0;1543;"I bought this machine in November 2001 based largely on the positive reviews here but since then I've noticed that most of the positive reviews of the Briel Chamonix are from customers who have only had it a few days or weeks. My machine worked great for a few weeks. It made excellent espresso and produced a lot of steam. Unfortunately, after a couple months, it started to leak. Not a few drops either. Streams of water run out of every opening and flood my countertop. Then the steamer stopped working. Today, 9 months and numerous replacement parts/repairs later, I finally gave up and bought a new one from Starbucks. I used my old Starbucks machine for 7 years before I ""upgraded"" to the Briel and I never had a problem with it. The construction was exceptional and the customer service unbeatable. The Briel machine is going in the trash. :-(";Very Poorly Made Machine
19;49.0;4.0;6.0;1621;My Chamonix just turned 18 months, and it still functions like new.  That may mean that the steaming nozzle leaks and the no-drip feature is a joke (oh, THAT's why it's got that drip pan under it!), but the coffee still reigns supreme.\nI've been concerned about the comments on cleaning the the silicone/rubber creama filter on the Apollo model, because the same is found in the Chamonix.  Every time I clean the basket, I wonder if the taste is being compromised by not being able to clean that filter.  What I do now is pour hot soapy water into the basket and let it drain completely.  I repeat this once or twice between cups and then rinse it well with very hot water.  I'm suprised how much cleaner it gets.\nMy biggest complaint is how finicky the machine is about tamping.  No matter what the grind (fine, not real fine), too heavily tamped grounds (i.e., more than one light rollover with the tamper) in this machine just block the flow.  If you  run a second shot of water to make the most of your effort, what little that does come out  tastes like burned espresso!  If espresso isn't flowing freely from the basket, dump the grounds and try it again.;This is no 1-year machine -- 18 months & loving it
20;19.0;3.0;12.0;1669;The Chamonix makes great coffee and is very well constructed.  One weakness is that the filter tends to leak easily and is quite tricky to clean, but it makes great coffee!\nNow the problem...........  Briel USA service is the worst I have ever encountered, I needed some spares and they cashed my check but I never got the spares AND you cannot contact them!!\nThis is really, really bad - Briel USA service lets down the whole company!!!;Great Coffee, terrible service
21;41.0;4.0;7.0;1713;"This is my fourth espresso machine, my  third with a pump. My last machine was a Gaggia Expresso, and this machine is better. It heats up very fast. Great crema every time. I love the ability to set the amount of espresso dispensed. The steamer is so powerful, I have to be careful. And the machine is relatively easy to clean. At first I thought it was a little flimsy, compared to the Gaggia, which was a chunk; however, I like the small size, because it fits under the cabinet.";A great, inexpensive espresso machine
22;16.0;1.0;18.0;1715;We have had this machine now for about two months, and the flaws keep getting bigger. It is very poorly designed and impossible to clean properly, which has a major effect on the flavor of the brew. The receptacle for the basket holder loads up with coffee debris requiring repeated cleanings with q-tips (very awkward and messy) and the strainer basket has a permanently placed disk of rubber internally that cannot be cleaned or accessed. I had to use a hacksaw to cut off the bottom of the basket and remove the VERY funky rubber disk, which I threw away. This improved the flavor considerably, but begs the question of why is it there in the first place? Also, the steamer nozzle constantly leaks and is also a pain to keep clean.\nSo if you enjoy spending a lot of time cleaning, modifying and maintaining your espresso machine, get this one. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague!! I would give it no stars, if it were possible.;Don't buy this machine!
23;25.0;2.0;11.0;1738;Let begin by saying this is my second machine. The first machine I had, had a problem with the pump and not shooting out the right amount of espresso. I returned the machine only to find out the same machine was available for alot less money, so I bought another one. Maybe it was just a bad machine I got. I've had the current machine for about 2 months and have experienced the same issue with the pump. Briel's customer service is not very helpful. They want you to ship the machine back to them (at your cost) for them to repair it (no loaner given). Needless to say, I am doing what I can to work around this issue.\nAlot of the features on this espresso maker, makes this machine appealing to someone who spends $135 per month on coffee from the local coffee house. But, read all the reviews before you decide to invest in this machine...;Nice Out of the Box
24;50.0;2.0;6.0;1740;This was my second machine and seemed fine until it broke. I have since ordered one made by Solis... For [this price] this is not a bad machine but one year of service is not what I was hoping for. If you notice most people who rave about the Chamonix have only had it for a short time. The best test of any product is time and this one failed me. ...;The 1 year Machine
25;6.0;4.0;41.0;1741;I purchased the Briel Chamonix as a step-up/replacement for my Krups steamer. After brewing a couple of shots, I realized the flavor I was missing while I was using my trusty Krups.  I feel I've made a reasonable purchase with this machine, with these positive observations:\n- This is a _great_ value for the money I spent.\n- Consistently positive reviews on Amazon (4/5 stars, 56 reviews)\n- Nice compact form\n- The machine heats up very quickly\n- Contrary to a couple of other reviewers' experience, the espresso produced is very hot, with no need to re-heat the coffee.\n- Excellent steam for frothing.\nThese were/are some draw-backs:\n- The distance under the brew-head to the base of the machine is, indeed, short. A shot glass fits comfortably, but nothing any taller.  I need to find a short container that holds two shots because:\n- When making two shots, the dispensor does not fill two individual shot glasses evenly.  The right glass _always_ fills up before the left.  I like double-shot lattes, so I find this an inconvenience.\n- The frothing wand is at a rather odd angle...\nNeutral thoughts and experiences:\n- The package arrived with excessive moisture on and around the machine, packaged inside a plastic bag, just as this web-site and other reviews have noted.  No surpise here.\n- As several reviewers experienced, the stainless steel front panel had come apart from the machine and was laying loose in the box. I attribute this to the aforementioned excessive moisture in the package and probable tempurature swings the package was subjected to before arrival at my doorstep.  I carefully cleaned the machine surface and removed the water droplets from the steel panel (used a blow dryer) and afixed it back to the machine. Seems to be holding fine.\n- Following the enclosed instructions, it took three attempts to prime the pump.\n- Having previous experience with espresso makers proved to be valuable in working with this machine. I think a beginner might not find the instructions very intuitive.;Decent value for the product...
26;57.0;2.0;5.0;1753;The machine makes great tasting espresso with a very nice crema however, the coffee isn't hot.  After calling the manufacturer, I found out that the coffee should be between 175-185 degrees.  My husband and I tested the temperature (for 10 days straight) and discovered it was only between 150-160 degrees.  I called Briel back and he said that we need to let the machine,with the filter holder in tact, warm up for 5 to 7 minutes before we make our first cup of coffee for the day. Well, we tried that and it only raised the temperature to 165 degrees.  Briel said we could send it in to have the thermostat replaced however it wouldn't do any good (because it was the user's fault not the machine...???)  SO...I guess we'll have to heat our espresso up in the microwave if we want hot coffee :-(  - I wouldn't buy this again.;um............some like it hot
27;58.0;4.0;5.0;1763;For years I've been making Espresso with a tiny Krups machine.  I simply didn't know what I was missing.  Well made, easy-to-follow instructions, and easy to use.  Best of all the espresso from this machine is hot enough to drink.  With my other machine I always found myself having to toss everything in the microwave after I was done.  Super hot, super good froth, great steamer, easy to clean...you get the idea.  One drawback:  There's not enough room where the espresso comes out to put a full-size mug.  So you'll have to find something smaller and make the transfer to a larger mug or cup.;Not Perfect, but a SUPER buy nonetheless!!!
28;42.0;3.0;7.0;1773;After reading the other information and reviews of this unit, I looked forward to receiving it and enjoying great coffee. After a couple of days of use, I did have great coffee. However, I also found that the steamer valve leaked constantly, and I was always either wiping up the mess, or putting a sponge under it to absorb the water that leaks out. Also, there is an adjustment provided for the size of cup you wish to fill. This is a great idea, however it has been implemented with a very inexpensive sliding reostat, which was always giving me inconsistent results. At times the cup would be just right, then a minor adjustment would lead to overflow. Further increasing the amount would result in a smaller protion again, etc.\nIn the final analysis, I decided that even though the coffee was terrific, the overall engineering and quality of this unit was not in line with the price, or my expectations. It is on it's way back, and I am now searching for another high quality espresso maker.;Great Coffee - Disappointing quality
29;39.0;5.0;8.0;1818;This is my first espresso machine and I did a lot of research before buying it.  The coffee I make (I love mocha) each morning is just as good as what I used to buy at a famous coffeehouse.;Great Cup of Espresso
30;12.0;4.0;20.0;1846;The Briel Chaminox is eveything other reviewers said it is... use and cleanup are easy, and the nectur that flows is supurb.  HOWEVER there is one minor annoyance... occasionally the machine fails to recycle and fill the espresso dispenser with water, so when you press the espresso-making button you get a discouraging dribble of coffee.  In that case, I've found the only way to get the machine to operate properly is to activate the steam function--release enough steam to froth a small pitcher of milk-- then turn-off the steam, and the machine will usually recycle itself into being ready to deliver water for espresso.  As I say, this is only occasionally...but it is annoying.  Otherwise the Briel Chaminox is a great machine for the money.;One Minor Annoyance But Otherwise Fabulous
31;15.0;1.0;19.0;1891;"I bought this machine in December 2000 based on Amazon customer reviews. I should have known from the moment I opened the box that this would be a poor decision. The instructional videotape in the box was blank,and when we called the 800 number to ask several questions, it seemed the customer service person who eventually answered didn't even know what espresso was.\nAfter 3 months, the foaming wand and the filter area leaked, and required repair at the service center. Now the unit doesn't seal\ncorrectly when you insert handle containing the filter into the machine and coffee spills all over the counter every time.\nThe coffee never tasted particularly good, and the ""crema"" seemed artificially produced by the ""patented"" filter for the mere purpose of the manufacturer being able to say it produces crema ""every time"". If you really want true espresso and good coffee, this is not where you are going to  find it.\nIf you must have machine made coffee with real crema I recommend  spending  the money and buying  a serious machine.  I'm going back to my trusty stove top stainless steel espresso model which produces excellent strong espresso  albeit without the ""crema"".";Spend a little more and buy a different and better machine
32;33.0;4.0;9.0;1915;I have been using the Chamonix Pump Expresso machine for a couple of weeks, and I am already considered a master of Cappucino-making by my wife. We enjoy going to a little French Bistro in the Coconut Grove Village here in Miami because of their wonderful Cafe Latte. Well, I guess they are not going to see us as frequently any more. From the very first time that I used it, I enjoyed the quickness of this machine. It makes expresso fast, with wonderful crema. I was able to make real thick froth, something that had been very difficult with previous expresso machines that I have owned. My only complaint has to do with the fact that there was no video tape in the box, as promised. However, I was able to figure out how to use the machine very fast without having to depend on the instructions. I highly recommend the Chamonix!;A wonderful, easy way to make Cappucino
33;28.0;3.0;11.0;1923;Solidly made, attractive - but difficult to understand. Though it has a setting for 8 cups of espresso, the basket only holds enough coffee for two cups.  If you like strong Cappucino, and you want more than one double shot because you're making two cappucino's - the machine can't deliver. If you want one or two cups of espresso - it'll do nicely.;Great Espresso, two cups at a time
34;34.0;5.0;9.0;1933;I was given this machine as a gift after months of begging for an espresso machine.  From the first time I plugged it in I was thrilled with the quality espresso coming from this machine.  It's practically instant and you'll be enjoying great coffee in no time.  Nothing complex here, it's very simple and easy to learn.  My only complaint is the small space for the cup.  I know this is an espresso machine, so the cups are small, but I like a lot of espresso sometimes, unfortunately anything much bigger than an espresso cup won't fit.  But that's just a minor issue that can be worked around.  If you want good espresso, I say buy it!;Excellent buy!
35;35.0;5.0;9.0;1950;I bought this because I was dissatisfied with the Krups Gusto. The difference between the 2 machines is night and day. This thing makes a great cup of expresso. The frothing attachment seems flimsy but works great. If I had to do it over again I probably would have bought the Briel Apollo for serveral reasons.\n1. It is less money.\n2. The only thing the Apollo doesn't do is automatically turn off (water flow control). In reality this isn't a big deal because by the time you do a little clean up and put away your coffee beans the coffee is ready.\n3. I like having a seperate tamper/scoop. The tamper is built on this machine. The apollo comes with a seperate tamper. (not a big deal just buy a tamper)\nAlso if you buy any expresso machine make sure you have expresso cups! When i bought my first one i had to make a run to the store so i would have cups for the coffee to flow into.;Outstanding
36;45.0;4.0;7.0;1962;We got our machine about 3 weeks ago and I can honestly say it works great.  I have never owned a machine before and had no idea how to use.  Just by reading the instructions, we had our first cup of espresso within minutes.  There are two things that I would change on the machine (minor):  the espresso while at a warm temp is not as hot as I like it, and finally, the frother attachment needs to be a little longer.  I bought a metal pitcher to froth milk, but found I was wasting too much milk trying to fill it up enough to get a good froth.  I found out if I used a measuring cup (glass) and fill only 1/4 c., I can get the froth I need and milk and throw out much less.  The machine is a good buy though for the money and my husband and I are very glad we purchased it.;Well Spent Money!!
37;59.0;1.0;5.0;1962;I was so excited to open the box and try my first capuccino. What disappointment! After half a dozen attempts my husband and I were unable to make a drink that was any warmer than lukewarm. Additionally, we thought it was a hassle to wait for the coffee drink to finish pouring, and then for the water to warm up before we could steam the milk. We were used to doing both simultaneously. Lastly, we had trouble finding two cups small enough to fit under the nozzle. A big thumbs down, ....;unhappy
38;52.0;5.0;6.0;1965;"The manufacturers' description of this machine was extremely accurate.  It produces 2 cups of espresso at once (which comes in handy at dinner parties) and produces a thick, rich, ""crema"" on top.  My girlfriends' mother (who is from Italy), pronounced the espresso, ""The best I've had in 20 years!""  The machine also produces seemingly endless amounts of steam, and quickly froths milk for delicious lattes.  It cleans up very easily and does not take up very much space on the countertop, which is important because we use it so often!";perfect crema!
39;37.0;3.0;9.0;1973;When I first bought this machine I thought it was the very best ever. I had owned 3 $300 machines and 2 machines in the $250 range before buying this one and was suspitious becasue of the low price, except  that the  reviews here on Amazon were so good. It worked perfectly and the freature that we truely loved was the ability to set the amount of espresso to be made and walk away from the machine and not have to worry that the espresso was going to go running up out the cup and on to the counter.  About 9 months in the button to start the espresso going had to be pushed 4 and 5 times to get it to fill up a cup of espresso. We descaled it even though we had only ever used distilled water. We soaked the basket in vinegar, baking soda, denture cleaner, it didn't matter.  I called the only place in the US to fix the thing - in NJ. They charge [$] minimum. Yes, it has a 10 year warrenty on the pump but so what? That just means you don't have to pay for a new pump. It's still [$] and you have to ship it there! After a lot more reserch we just threw it out and bought the very same one again. You have to figure it is a disposable item.  And it stil makes the best cup of espresso with the best crema ever - I would recommend it highly still - just know that  you'll prpbably have to buy another in a year - and it's such a good machine (when it works) that you'll want to.;It broke in less than a year but I bought another one anyway
40;30.0;5.0;10.0;1988;I just received my Briel ES35AB Chamonix Pump Espresso Machine With Auto Espresso Flow and had it up and running in 5 minutes (that included: rinsing the reservoir and attachments, plugging in the electrial cord, pouring the water into the reservoir and turning it on).  Every part of the espresso maker is working wonderfully.  The reasons for purchasing this machine was so I could have a reservoir of water and also to use the espresso pods in order to make numerous individual cups of espresso for our dinner parties.  It is very easy to clean afterwards, and in just a minute or two after turning it on, just put the espresso pod in the pod holder, insert and turn, press the button, and in 20-30 seconds you have a cup of espresso.  I am very satisfied with the product and would encourage others to purchase it as well.;It's a fantabulous machine!
41;14.0;5.0;20.0;2007;We have had this machine for about a week now and are enjoying it very much. It arrived in good condition with a little bit of condensation on the plastic.  The set-up instructions were a little bit confusing at first but I had brewed the first cup of espresso within 20 minutes of opening the box. Perhaps this wouldn't have been an issue had the instruction video been included. However, the machine really is not difficult to operate. I have not had to refer to the instructions after my first time using it.  As everyone says, there is always ample crema. The espresso is rich and never bitter. You wait about two minutes after turning it on for it to heat up and brewing itself takes about 30 seconds (though it obviously depends on how many ounces you brew). The milk frother works pretty well and is not very hard to clean. You open the steam valve for a couple seconds to clean the inside tube, wipe it, and occassionally screw it off and immerse it in hot water. The total cleaning time is about 3 minutes, if you use both the espresso maker and the frother.  The silver-colored plate is coming loose - apparently from the heat - but has not fallen off. The Chamonix is compatible with espresso pods as well, though I have not used them yet. For the price and the features, I give it five stars and would recommend it.;Excellent value and performance
42;53.0;2.0;6.0;2023;Although well built, the single-hole diaphragm does not make crema as well as my other espresso makers. The espresso does not come out evenly, so one cup fills twice as fast as the other.\nIt apears that the coffee pod adapter on the bottom of the boiler interferes with the proper tamping of the coffee grounds, so it's hard to get a good seal. I really cinch the filter holder to avoid leaks. You might have better luck with the coffee bod holder.\nFinally, the measure has a really short handle, so you will have to do a bit of digging to get the grounds out of the can or jar.\nOn the plus side the machine heats up quickly and and is ready to make coffee in just a few minutes, and has lots of steam to froth milk very well.\nUnless you use the coffee pod system, I suggest that you stay away from the dual pod/ground coffee machines.;Perfect Coffee Maker - Not Yet
43;31.0;5.0;10.0;2027;"This is my first espresso machine, but I have been an espresso addict since I lived in Paris and started each day with a ""grande creme"" in the corner cafe. I can't compare this with other machines, but the flavor and consistency of the espresso and cappucino is what I've been driving and paying big bucks for at our local coffee house. The machine is very easy to use, and after a few tries I found the perfect settings for my taste. It does great on the frothed milk for cappucino.  My only problem is that I may have to switch to decaf now that I can drink my favorite beverage at home for pennies a cup!";Worked right out of the box

We use it weekly, clean up is a snap, and our mocha's, cappucino's and latte's are very enjoyable. Our last maker was a Krups and this Briel espresso maker tastes so much better. One added benefit is that you don't have to worry about running out of water when steaming your milk! We love it!;great cappucino, perfect crema, and so easy to use.
45;23.0;5.0;12.0;2063;I ordered this machine the beginning of January and have been using it every day since it arrived. to make wonderful cappacino.

I never buy espresso/cappacino at Starbucks or Java City anymore, because mine made at home is better.  Now if I could just find a great recipe for a frozen mocha.;Easy to clean machine
46;24.0;1.0;12.0;2064;"I bought this machine for my husband for Christmas, based on Amazon's customer reviews.\nAt first, it seemed like a pretty good machine, even though it dripped badly (despite the touted ""no drip"" feature).  It is our first pump machine, so the ability to make lots of steamed milk was a big plus, even though we didn't think the coffee came out as well as our 10-year old bottom-of-the-line Krups.\nHowever, it started malfunctioning quickly.  The sliding 'knob' to control amount of coffee did not work.  Sometimes only an ounce of coffee would come out, sometimes several ounces, no matter how it was set.\nFinally, hardly anything was coming out. I figured it was obstructed, and I started soaking the filter in vinegar overnight.  This would work for a day or so, then no coffee again.  We called the 800 number on the back of the machine, and they said to send it (our responsibility to pay the postage) to New York for repair.\nWe use only filtered water in the machine, and there is no scale built up anywhere.  The machine is 3 months old and looks new.  IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.  I will not be buying this kind of thing online anymore.  It's too messy and inconvenient to deal with problems.  I'm sticking with books and records.";The Short, Irritating Life of the Briel Chamonix
47;7.0;4.0;40.0;2117;"First, to expose my bias -- I am a purist and love traditional Italian espresso, without any ""Americano"" bastardization. This machine brews an outstanding Italian-style espresso, with some of the best crema I've ever had either side of the Atlantic. The temperature is just right; my previous German-brand machines didn't get the water hot enough. It is delightfully simple and straightforward to use. My very first brew was spot on. The price is a true bargain.\nThe Chamonix, however, is not perfect. I join the chorus of complaints regarding the deceiving label claiming an instructional video was enclosed. There is none. This is inexcusable. Fortunately, a video is not necessary for operation of this machine.\nMy front panel is firmly attached.\nI understand there can be residual water from the factory pump tests, so I was not surprised to find it. I have also found it in other espresso machines.\nThe overall feeling of the unit is ""plasticy."" Construction in some areas is on the flimsy side; the Auto Espresso Flow control knob and the metal drip tray grid especially so. I suppose any unit in this price range will be similarly constructed. I just couldn't bring myself to spend $500 on one with more metal, knowing the espresso wouldn't taste any better.\nThe Briel AquaStop System, claiming elimination of most of the annoying dripping found in espresso units, falls far short. The Chamonix drips as much as any of the other units I've owned.\nThe Auto Espresso Flow doesn't impress me. It's difficult to gauge just how much water is going to be delivered. This required a lot of hit and miss brewing. I don't feel it provides any real benefit. I'd rather switch off the flow of water when I say so. Fortunately, this is an option.\nThe ""turbo-jet"" frother was equally unimpressive. Frothing was still on the difficult side. I've never owned an espresso machine that really made frothing easy. I note that the owner's manual mentions an optional Quick Froth Cappuccino accessory. If you intend to froth much, you might want to check the accessory out. Fortunately for me, I usually just brew straight espresso. I found the frother's nozzle to be difficult to remove for cleaning, and poorly made.  But the Chamonix delivers where it counts -- in your demitasse cup!";No doubt -- Excellent Espresso for This Price Range
48;47.0;5.0;7.0;2132;Easy to use, no learning-curve at all, makes lots of Espresso if you want a big boost and always with a nice crema top on it. It could not be easier to use. Thoughtful design allows for easy cleaning. Construction is of a decent looking plastic, but parts of it are made from a metal, giving it the look of a much more expensive machine. This has to be one of the best machines in its price class. The Espresso is at least the same as the stuff at Starbucks and I can drink it before I go to work.;Great Espresso
49;20.0;2.0;13.0;2132;I finally decided to replace my 10+ year old Braun Espresso maker and chose this one after the good reviews I read. Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to its promise. The pump doesn't deliver the right amount of water most of the time. I finally decided to return it after I ran through four pump cycles to get the amount of water I expect to get out of one cycle (sometimes it works right). I've read the directions and I don't believe I'm doing anything wrong. I also don't think the machine is necessarily defective, just of questionable quality. I'll be looking for a different brand next time.;Looked promising, but it was a disappointment
50;55.0;4.0;6.0;2137;This is a great price for a product with these features.  The reservoir and pump are great.  I have used it with the esspresso pods from Starbucks and they work fine.  The double spout isn't so cool though because each side flows at a different rate.  I ended up using a Starbucks esspresso shot to measure and catch.\nThe steamer is great and with the resevoir/pump you don't have to worry about running out of steam.\nMy chrome plate was off when I received it, but I pressed it to the front and it still remains in place 2 months later.;Best product for the price
51;17.0;1.0;17.0;2158;First of all the pump did not work.  I called the help number and they walked me through a repair.  I had to take the machine apart and re-attach the wire for the pump.

52;48.0;4.0;7.0;2158;I found this to be the perfect machine to start with.  I wanted a machine that wasn't too expensive because I didn't know how often I would use it.  I use it at least once a day now, which is more than I used my coffee machine.  It is easy to clean and has a large enough water resevor to make several drinks.  I wish the steaming wand was a bit longer.;THe perfect starter machine
53;11.0;4.0;22.0;2178;This posting is primarily for people who want to buy this and are reading the reports of water condesation inside the plastic bag of the new units.  THIS IS NORMAL.  You just need to follow the instructions to clean the unit prior to first use.\nIf you read the instruction manual carefully enough you will find that water condensation is the result of water pressure testing that every machine apparently goes trhough as the quality assurance. This condensation (and the high rate of incidents of the face plate falling off) can be a problem if you buy this machine as a gift for someone.\nApart from those small issues, the pump, filter, filter holder, frother and all the controls (the imprtant stuff!) are as sturdy as industrial espresso units. If you buy it for yourself you'll have great espresso.

54;60.0;4.0;5.0;2186;This is my second espresso machine. My other is a german brand , with equivalent price.  This machine makes much better espresso, particularly the crema and froth.  Thus far highly recommended.;Preliminary Review, Much Better Than the deutschlander
55;27.0;4.0;12.0;2188;"I recived my machine with great anticipation. Once I opened the box, the metal face plate on the front had fallen off. I'm guessing that the glue doesn't work so well in the cold of the UPS truck?? I stuck the plate back on without any trouble.\nI plugged the machine in and added water. The instructions said that the ""OK"" light would light after 3 minutes. I waited and waited and it never lit. I pushed the brew button anyway and sure enough cold water came out.\nAfter waiting two weeks for this unit, I was crushed to get one that didn't work. Not wanting to wait for a replacement unit, I took the unit apart and discovered that a wire had came loose. I reattached the wire and now the ""OK"" light came on and the water was heated.\nThese troubles aside, the machine makes great esprsso. It brews at the perfect temperature. (I hate coffee/espresso that is so hot it burns your tongue off.) The unit is very easy to use and fairly easy to clean. It's a great unit but after my troubles, I can't give the machine a perfect rating. Maybe I just got a lemon?";Great but a few flaws

The only complaint I have is that I like to use a regular sized coffe cup to hold the 7-8oz brew I prefer.  Most won't fit under the spigot even with the metal tray/plate removed.\nAlso,  after 5 years I finally have a problem with my unit.  I don't know what is wrong but it is dead. It sure has made a heck of a lot of coffe in those five years.  I am going to try to use the warranty (10 years on the pump).\nEven if they don't fix it, I would not hesitate to buy another.

57;8.0;5.0;35.0;2271;This is the fourth espresso machine that I have owned in the last ten  years and it is, by far, the best. Besides making the most consistently  perfect cup of espresso, I find it the easiest to clean and fill.  The tape  that was included with the machine was helpful. You will find moisture  within the wrapping of an unopened machine. At first I thought I had a used  machine but soon found out that all the machines are pressure tested with  water before packing.;A well designed machine
58;3.0;4.0;61.0;2309;"We've owned this Briel model for 3 years, and have used it 4-5 times per day.  It is very convenient to operate and clean.  The viewable water level  lets you know when the water level is low, and the water reservoir is big  enough that one doesn't have to fill it too often.\nMy only complaint is  the difficulty in getting parts (rubber ""O"" rings for the  frothing wand).  Briel needs to improve parts availability in the U.S.  However, the value for money cannot be beat, and so I'm buying a new one  for my office.\nBy the way, the espresso and cappucino is great from the  machine -- good crema and froth.";Good Value -- Can't Go Wrong

The magic ""crema"" disc must do the trick, combined with the higher pressure of ~ 15 bars. Stovetop  machines can't force the steam through the coffee correctly because they  only generate 3 bars (atmospheres). What sold me was the 10 year guarantee  on the pump. If most espresso machines can do the job, I wanted one that  would last.  I looked at machines from $20 closeouts to $2000 commerical  models. This is the lowest priced with the best features. Anything cheaper,  doesn't give you the pressure (except the Briel's Lido) nor the autoflow so  you don't have to hold down a lever. ""Just set it and forget it for a  minute"". Anything more expensive doesn't add much more than aesthetics  and commercial capacity. Oops, gotta go, it's getting cold.";Superb espresso you don't have to climb the Alps for

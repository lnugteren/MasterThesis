0;3.0;3.0;13.0;0;Pro: Lots of words, rarely you can find a word that is not included in this dictionary unless you are working in a very specialized field.  Size is small.  Definition is better than many desktop dictionaries.\n\nCon: Slow processing time, it sometime takes as much as 5 seconds to retrieve a definition.  Key button is small, and not easy to press.  Pronounciation is not very clear.  But you can plug in your own earphone to get better quality.  For most words, you don't see sample sentenses in a definition.  There is no picture in a definition at all.\n\nAnyway this is one of the best on the market for an electronic dictionary. My ideal electronic dictionary should be,\n1. A large collection of vocabularies.\n2. Definition retrieving time is less than 0.5 second.\n3. Color screen, and include color picture in a definition for noun.\n4. Video clips in a definition for verb.\n5. Samples sentenses in definitions.\n6. Pronounciation is clear and loud.\n7. Buttons can easily pressed.;best on the market
1;9.0;5.0;6.0;35;This is a wonderful product and I'm having so much fun and learning so much with this product- I love it that it pronounces words for me!! And I like the part where I can store the words that I am working on to learn the meanings of and the pronounciations!;What a great find!!
2;8.0;1.0;11.0;105;This item worked great except after 2 years the on/off button does not work anymore.  The add-on slot for accessories, say encyclopedia-4th edition, is useless.  The encyclopedia is slow to load.  Looking to by another talking dictionary but will not consider Franklin!;Terrible.  On/Off button not working after about 2 years.
3;35.0;4.0;6.0;151;This is the best & excellent product. Every parent should give gift to their children. I give gift to my daughter. She told me that dad your gift is very helpful to me in study. She is doing biology,and in final semester for graduate.;Excellent
4;24.0;3.0;8.0;175;The definitions are good, it is easy to use and have a good number of words.\n\nAlso you can buy expansion cards if you want to learn other languages from the original website.\n\nBut the Speaking function is useless. The pronunciation is totally different from the right pronounce.\n\nAnd by having the Speaking function it is heavier and bigger to have the speakers.\n\nI returned it to buy the other model without the Speaking: cheaper, lighter, smaller and with the same functions.;All good but speaking function
5;26.0;3.0;8.0;188;It is a good dictionary but the quality of sounds is pretty bad. Also as everybody said it is quite slow, which does not bother me so much as the poor speaker sound.;Just ok
6;34.0;4.0;7.0;204;The collection of vocabulary and thesaurus is terrific, and includes many slangs and idioms. The voice pronunciation is a little robot-like since it is not real recording (that will require larger memory space), but acceptable, and generally pretty good. The delay in searching for a match when the input is not accurate is 2-5 seconds, and navitage back and forth between words is 1-4 seconds. If that is long depends on who you ask. Funny enough, all four-letter words are collected but have no voice pronunciations. Maybe they do not want your co-riders think that you are speaking to them on commuter trains, or they just do not want you to learn how to say them.\n\nThe flap cover is basically a joke. Within 7 days after getting it, I dropped it on wood floor, and that broken the hinge to the flap. I tried glues and none works. I think I will make a cloth bag myself sometime to hold it. I do not feel comfortable letting the gel keys and screen rubbing against my keys in my bag. It feels definitely more fragile than my $10 Sharp calculator, but I could be wrong.\n\nOverall, it is good, and much better than my American Heritage CD, which requires a computer and makes airplane taking off noise every so often. The latter does have real people voice pronunciation, if you care.;Good functionality, poor quality
7;11.0;4.0;13.0;218;This product is okay. It is a good product for its price. However, I have some frustrations over its functionality. Its processor is quite slow. If one types in a word incorrectly, it can take up to good 5-10 seconds searching for the best matching words. Moreover, the keypads are too stiff. It requires too much effort to depress its buttons. My fingers often get fatigued during a long stretch of reading - or maybe I am looking up too many words. Furthermore, its pronunciation function is not reliable. Despite its less than perfect pronunciation, the manufacturer failed to provide pronunciation symbols. Thus, one must rely only on its verbal feedback.  On the positive side, it provides clear and succinct definitions, portability, and durability.\n\nI have another brand of electronic dictionary by SHARP and its functionality and ease of use is phenomenal. It comes with a built-in voice recorder with an expansion SM card slot. Thus enables user to record several hours of voice recording. Furthemore, its processor is super fast and keypads are smooth. However, my Sharp does not have clear and succint of definition as Franklin and its extremely expensive ($375 USD).\n\nIn conclusion, Frankline is a good-buy considering its price.;The processor is as slow as a sprinting snail and the keypads are as stiff as over-starched cargo pants.
8;17.0;4.0;11.0;219;i had mix feeling about this dictionary, bad news first....the dictionary is slow, compared to most hand held electronics today it process at the speed of a snail, almost no action you do will get an instant result, it takes about half a sec to up to 3 secs to see the result, if you don't mind the minor delay then its not a big issue...another thing is the memory...it can only hold 40 flash card words...as a student i find that useless, for a electronic flash cards to even be useful i need enough space for at least 200-300 words...and the design isn't exactly sleek either...it looks like it got dug up by some archeologist, at the same time it's black and white...meaning i was expecting it to be A LOT faster/more memory due to the fact that its made from 1980's blackish/greenish screen\n\nok the good news...number 1 good news is there isn't a lot of english-english electronic dictionary out there....all the fancy, sleek, massive memory, super speed, in color dictionaries are foreign...meaning it don't come with english-english dictionary...also its very bulky and durable...the greenhouse effect can melt the polar ice destroying every living organism on the planet, and the Franklin SCD-1870 Speaking 11th Collegiate Dictionary would end up being the last recorded history of man kind...its also VERY VERY cheap, all the color, web surfing dictionary cost around 300-500 bucks, for under 100 dollars, you get your money's worth\n\nso the conclusion...to the Franklin company i give you 3 and half stars...you guys know what people want...they just want a freaking simple dictionary...SCD-1870 is kinda like the very first nintendo system...when everyone else is playing on a playstation 3...you got the right idea, and a very good start...however if you don't want to get outsourced by the chinese...i'd strongly suggest making it smaller, in color, way faster...and finally AT LEAST double the memory size...else its just a matter of time, and you're asking for it;The truth about Franklin SCD-1870 Speaking 11th Collegiate Dictionary

It is complete with over 400 definitions, their origins, and a thesaurus(500,00 synonyms and antonyms, and if you are not sure of the pronunciation, it speaks it for you.

12;52.0;5.0;5.0;263;I paid about $80 for this--and don't regret it because I'm planning on using it throughout my college years. It's handy if you want to expand your vocabulary, but don't want to waste precious time pouring over a large dictionary.\n\nThe small slanted keys--the main thing that isn't quite appealing to me. I have slender fingers, and can imagine how annoying they may be for males. It is just not pleasant to the touch!\n\nOtherwise, I would recommend it, although the price is a bit steep. But if you take care of it, perhaps you'll think its a worthy investment.;It's A Keeper!
13;14.0;5.0;14.0;304;This is a really good portable e-dictionary to own. I've bought this for for my child to take to school instead of carrying the regular dictionary in book form. Although it's more expensive than many other e-dictionaries out there on the market, you'd truly get what you pay for on this gadget. It makes no sense to own an e-dictionary if it does not contain definitions of words you've entered in it. I had a list of words used to check and compare the sophistication of many e-dictionaries. The word list consisted of advanced science words, medical words as well as advanced collegiate words. This is the only e-dictionary on the market where it returned with definitions for all but one word on the list. The majority of other e-dictionaries failed after the first or second word on my list.\n\nFurthermore, my kid's writing teacher, a retired English teacher, had at first disapproved of using this e-dictionary and recommended buying the book. Well, my kids let her try it out while they're working on an assignment. She came back at the end of class to say that this e-dictionary is really good. Now, how's that for an endorsement of this product!;Top-of-the-line portable electronic dictionary

15;6.0;4.0;30.0;318;"I have the Franklin Speaking 11th Collegiate Dictionary and the PW-E550 Sharp. I've been reading Song of Roland and have been looking up words in both to see how they compare.\n\nHands down. If you plan to use the dictionary for literature written in older English, you want the Franklin; I've searched for many words over the last week, and the Franklin rarely fails me, but the Sharp frequently does not have what I need. Also, I find that words I do not know how to spell can be located more easily on my Franklin.\n\nI love the way the Sharp is packaged--closes up in a nice little box, nice big keys to push, large print on the screen, pronunciation guide included, but no spoken component. None of that makes it worth buying if it fails to have the words I need.\n\nUnfortunately, the Franklin has small keys and a floppy cover. I like the electronic speaking voice, but I'd prefer it include the written pronunciation as well as the spoken. The use of the Franklin, however, is intuitive, where I've had to do more reading of the owner's manual for the Sharp.\n\nI plan to buy each of my children his own dictionary; although I like the Sharp's package better, I will be buying them all Franklins.\n\n--Homeschooling mom";Franklin vs Sharp
16;13.0;4.0;16.0;367;I am extremely pleased with this product. It is extremely helpful when you're not sure how to spell a word, and gives you many options. The speach clarity is great also. I have purchased three of these already. One for me, then my daughter wanted one , and just purchased one for my mother. We are all very pleased! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my vision is impaired from multilple sclerosis, and I wish I could increase the font sizer just a bit larger. The font size is adjustable, just not quite large enough for me.\n\nThis is great item for anyone. I really like typing in sentences and playing it back on speach mode.

I originally experienced some miscommunication with the manufacturer; however, I am pleased to say that they did ultimately resolve the problem.\nThe dictionary is great! It is very convenient to carry around, the Speak feature helps with pronunciation of unusual words, and the e-bookman card expansion feature (to add other e-books)saves a lot of money. I did receive a defective bookman card at one point but Franklin sent me a replacement right away.";Great Product

19;30.0;5.0;11.0;422;I'm a terrible speller, and I've bought several different spell checkers.  This is best one out there.  It not only shows you how to spell the word, but it also shows you the meanings, synonyms, and confusables (words that sound the same, e.g. our/are/hour).  And if you wish, it even pronounces the word for you.  So don't buy a cheaper version.  Buy the best, and this is it.;If you need a spell checker, look no farther, this is the one you want.

Everyone in the family sneaks into my son's room to borrow his 'words'. This dictionary has our highest recommendation. Easy to use and we rarely find a word that isn't in it. The sound quality and clarity of the speech are excellent.;BEST GIFT EVER
21;57.0;4.0;5.0;503;I have had this dictionary over a year. I use it daily. I use such features as a dictionary, synonims and pronunciation. English is a second language for me so those features are very helpful and importamt . Also , I like the way words are explained. They are explained in simple manner. If I have a trouble still to understanding  a meaning of a word I press for thesaurus. Some other time I have a trouble to understand a word in explanation, so I underline it and press a botton for clarification. In addition, I use thesaurus for selecting  words when I write an essay , just replacing the same words with similar in meanings. My children find it useful and easy to use too.

23;2.0;3.0;312.0;530;"I'm a big electronic dictionary geek - I own four of them.  Two of them for languages (Japanese and Chinese) and two for English.  I'm a writer and I am constantly reading and looking up words, and I like to be able to do away from my computer because honestly, who wants to lug around a laptop when they just want to take a book out to a coffee shop?\n\nI own both the Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Speaking Dictionary (with a Concise Columbia Encyclopedia card) and the Sharp PW-E550.  I owned the Merriam-Webster first, then got the Sharp, and actually bought the Seiko Concise Encyclopedia Britannica for a while before I returned that one.  Here's a comparison between the MW and the Sharp, with a brief mention of the Seiko:\n\n- Both the MW and the Sharp have a similar range of definitions.  There are some words I could find in the MW I couldn't in the Sharp (McGuffin), and there are some I could find in the Sharp but not the MW (phylogenic, the Bowery).  I find that the MW tends to have slightly more in-depth definitions and the Sharp one reads a bit more concise and colloquial.  The Sharp provides examples of usage while the MW doesn't.  Both have good etymologies.\n\n- The MW doesn't have a visual pronounciation key, while the Sharp does.  That's because the MW speaks out the words.  This to me is kind of silly because you don't always want to hear the words out loud (like, in a library, or just about anywhere public), even if there's a headphone jack.  What became problematic was that the speaking gizmo on my MW broke after a few months, and now I can't even hear the pronounciation even if I want to.  I just hear a bunch of static when I hit the ""pronounce"" button.\n\n- The Sharp will list all the words possible with each input of a letter (i.e., if you punch in ""a"" it'll list all the words that begin with ""a,"" then if you punch in ""b"" it'll list all the words that begin with ""ab"" until you get to the word you want.  The MW waits until you input all the letters and hit ""enter,"" then it searches until it finds something.  It takes about a second or two for it to find something that is in its dictionary, but if you punch in something with the wrong spelling or it just doesn't know, it'll take a while, maybe five seconds, which gets kind of exasperating, especially once you get used to the Sharp.\n\n- The Sharp, when you turn it on, displays exactly what you had when you last had it on.  The MW always starts with the same default screen.  I love this ability, though there's one slight inconvenience - if you had entered letters before you turned off the Sharp the letters will still be there when you turn it back on, meaning you have to hit ""clear"" to start a new search.  The Sharp has a memory feature, that goes back some forty or so of your last entries, while the MW doesn't.\n\n- The buttons on the MW are hard and they hurt after prolonged usage.  The buttons on the Sharp are pretty soft, which ends up with the opposite problem: you may not push hard enough on them at times or you may push more than one button if you do so hurriedly.\n\n- The Concise Encyclopedia that I got with the MW is extremely painful to use.  It's slower than the dictionary and when you do page up or page down it often goes straight to the previous or next entry.  Otherwise it provides some decent amount of information at your fingertips.  I'm just afraid of the tediousness of it all.\n\n- The leather flip cover for the MW is really flimsy, while the Sharp is neatly self-protecting.  I also like how you can open the whole thing 180 degrees, which is something the Seiko can't do.  The Seiko only opens up to about 135 degrees, which might seem adequate until you get used to the Sharp.\n\n- The games that come with the MW aren't so great.  I like the idea of creating your own wordlist, but it barely takes any, maybe 20 maximum.  After playing with them a bit my first week with the MW, I stopped using the game function.\n\n- The Sharp has a grammar guide that I hardly ever use.  I suppose it could be handy, but it just feels impractical.\n\nFor a long while I carried around both the MW and the Sharp, with Sharp being my first resource then, if I have to, the MW, and if I really have to, the Concise Encyclopedia in the MW.  After a while I just ditched the MW and now I only use the Sharp.  It is a far better experience, and it's become an indispensible tool.  I was excited to check out the Seiko when it came out, but for the price I was quite disappointed.  The user experience, while better than the MW, pales compared to the Sharp.  The entries in the Seiko are great, a lot of information and depth, but most of the terms in there are in the Sharp anyway, just not with as much detail.  For $180, I decided I could just stick with the Sharp for basic concepts on the proper nouns, and head to my laptop when I want more in-depth detail.\n\nOverall, Sharp has converted me.  The MW now sits on my bookshelf like the real, paper dictionaries it tried to replace.";Good, but there's better

I particular like the feature that allows me to learn a word every time I turn the dictionary on.  There are other features, such as games that I don't think are very useful for me.  I like the pronunciation feature that helps me learn how to pronounce new words; unfortunately, the sound is kind of hard to discern.  The sound is a little not natural and smooth.  This dictionary would be better if its covering is made of some metal rather than leather and has a pocket.  I have to buy my own pocket to store the dictionary and backup batteries.  However, overall I like this dictionary.";convenient dictionary
27;59.0;5.0;5.0;569;In order to be able to find the dictionary when I needed it, I bought each of my kids a dictionary too.  They were always borrowing it because of the features for your own personal vocabulary list and speaking spelling bee.  We all love the convenience of not having to use a bulky dictionary when we were reading and came across an unfamiliar word.  We especially love the dictionary's ability to pronounce the words.  I was particularly pleased that I was able to look up the pronunciations of different chemical compounds used in lamination processes in a graduate level chemistry book I was reading.  I can't recommend this dictionary enough for every student.  When my kids start taking foreign languages, I will buy them the module for that particular language to help them with their studies.;Most convenient dictionary ever
28;54.0;3.0;7.0;591;"I just got this item (the more expensive model, by the way), so I have not had much time using the dictionary functions.  However, I have a couple of caveats. First, the screen needs to be backlit more than it is.  There is not sufficient contrast between the background and the type to make it easy to read. It has the option for reading e-books, but I think it would be annoying to try to read this display for any length of time because it is so dull. The ""rolodex"" function is very basic.  It defaults to first name alphabetization. There is no space for email addresses, which is bizarre in 2006.  You can probably fit in more than one phone number, but not identify which number is which if you do.  There is barely space for one address.  I am most disappointed in this device because of the dim readout, but the Fred Flintstone rolodex is a big letdown as well.";"Don't expect much from the ""rolodex"" feature, and the readout is dim."

The cards provide word gender information and examples on how the words can be used.\n\nCons: speaking dictionary for English or Spanish: the sound is not clear at all. It is a little bigger than expected.;Excellent!
30;31.0;1.0;13.0;621;"This product is incredible.  What?  200,000 words?  It also pronounces the word for you.  And... you can hold up to I think 40 words in your own person dictionary - that's what I liked best.  Although I'll admit, for a product that houses 200,000 defined and articulated words, can we do a little better than 40?  You'd be surprised how fast that number is reached.  Then it's a pain to delete them.  But overall a good product.  People like playing with it too, it has games, and all that jazz that people really do enjoy playing with.  I, however, am fed up with the product, after it broke for not once, but the second time.  Granted I kept it in my bookbag (just graduated - penn state - holler) but the fact is I wasn't slamming my bookbag around.  And even if I was, what's the big deal?  It doesn't have a scratch on it, and bam.  The first one broke after my sister was playing a game.  The store said I pryed it open, I'm like ""uh, not really.""  The second one just broke straight up, for no apparent reason.  I'm giving it a 1 star because this product lacks bad reviews and I want the brevety of my complaint to be felt on the stars.  PS.  Subscribe to dictionary.com's word-of-the-day; it's really cool.  Although make sure you read the word every time they e-mail it to you, otherwise you'll end up with tons of words in your inbox and get sick of it.  In that case, delete all the words, and start over.  I've moved on to a dictionary with a mere 130,000 words in it.  It acts as a bookmark as well.  It's a Zelco Bookmark Dictionary II.  We'll see.

My sister has one and after constantly borrowing hers I finally decided to purchase one of my own. In addition to the dictionary and thesauras I really enjoy the games. My only complaint about the dictionary is the words are not phonetically spelled out, but the voice pronunciation helps.;Great!
33;15.0;5.0;21.0;707;I am very satisfied with my dictionary. It has been very useful, not just for definitions, thesaurus, and grammar, but also for pronunciations. Of course, it has a robotic sounding voice, but at least it gives me an idea of how the words are supposed to be pronounced. With a regular book dictionary, I would often have to look up a familiar word in order to exactly find out how another is pronounced. It is also far better than having to carry a heavy book dictionary around the house.\n\nThe keyboard part of the dictionary is fine. It does have little buttons, but I would not want the dictionary to be any bigger in order to accomodate large buttons. The screen is also fine. It is made to be portable. The screen and the keys are made well for the size. I suppose if a person does not like the small keys and the small screen, it is just as well to have a laptop.\n\nThe other thing that I like about this dictionary is that if a word is misspelled, it gives options. As far as being slow, I've not had this problem since I have been accustomed to the old books where flipping pages, and going through the alphabet while looking for the word, is the norm, and takes just as long if not longer.\n\nI've had this little gadget for several months now, and I've been very happy with it. I just hope it will last for years and years just like the dictionary of the olden days.;A very convenient gadget!

He struggles with spelling, and I wanted to help reduce the frustration he feels when trying to look up words in a standard dictionary.  He loves this device! Although it is not a child's dictionary, its features make it usable by even this young boy. He can type in a phonetic spelling and find the correct spelling for words he wants to use in his written work. Even though the definitions may be advanced, he can look up words in the definition instantly! His vocabularly is growing swiftly while his frustration level is decreasing. In addition, he learns new words every time he turns the Franklin on! He and I play the spelling games and have a lot of fun together while learning at the same time. His mother is overjoyed because my grandson can enter his weekly spelling words into the Franklin and practice on his own. Spelling is no longer overwhelming. In my professional capacity as psychotherapist and specialist consultant to families about learning disabilities, I am now recommending the Franklin as an assitive device for children at the right reading level.

40;5.0;3.0;51.0;754;"It's been a long time since I last took the SAT, and increasingly I find myself encountering words that I know I used to know but can no longer recognize.  It turned into embarassment a month ago when I tried to read out a story for a kid and there were half a dozen words I either didn't know the meanings or how to pronounce!  Time to get a dictionary.\n\nSo I picked up this Franklin Speaking Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition.  (That's its full official product name.)  I chose it because of its speaking feature.  I found the price a bit too high, but I was willing to shell out the dough for the Franklin name as well as the venerable Merriam-Webster brand.  (My first real dictionary was an M-W.)\n\nUpon receiving the Franklin and thoroughly playing with it, I find myself both excited and disappointed.  Here's why.\n\nThis electronic dictionary has a lot of features.  It has a dictionary with a claimed vocabulary for 200,000 words.  (But who's counting?)  There's also a 500,000-entry thesaurus.  Then there are lots of learning tools (like an SAT word list) and games (like ""hangman"" and ""letris"").  You can even turn on a setting called ""learn a word"" so every time you turn on the dictionary, a word and its definition are displayed, allowing you to build up your vocabulary randomly.\n\nThe dictionary feature is the one I bought this for, and for the most part it's great.  Each word entry gives you its part of speech, its year of first use (some amazing trivia here!), definitions (of course), some usage examples, synonyms, and etymology.  Most words also have a spoken pronunciation, but no written pronunciation key.  I'm very disappointed that the speech is computer-generated speech, not human-recorded speech.  Last year when I was traveling in Asia I saw electronic dictionaries in the $100 range with real human speech.  The quality was just amazing.  I really wish Franklin had used human speech, or at least provided written pronunciation keys to supplement the poor-sounding computer voice.\n\nYou can view the word screen in three different sizes: small (11 lines), medium (8 lines), or large (6 lines).  Large size is by far the best-looking, not only because the font is big, but it's also smooth.  The other two sizes look too jagged, and there's often a shadow behind the text that makes reading difficult.  There is *no* backlight on this thing, making it impossible to use in the dark.\n\nUnfortunately, I've found a few words -- by no means tricky words or foreign ones -- that are not in this dictionary but I can find on the free Encarta online dictionary (...).  This is very disappointing, making me suspicious of the vocabulary capacity of this product.\n\nOne more thing that disappoints me: the overall build quality of the product is rather poor.  Assembled in Malaysia, it just feels cheap, period.  It's made of gray plastic that ages quickly, and the thumbboard buttons are the worst I've ever used.  (I've used countless PDA thumbboards as well as those in the Treo, Sidekick, Blackberry, etc.)  The buttons are hard tactilely and not very responsive.  The flip cover is a total joke and can come off very easily.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product that cost me 90 bucks.\n\nOn the plus side, this Franklin uses 2 easy-to-find-and-cheap AAA batteries.  I can't comment on the battery life yet since I just got this a couple days ago.  But given it doesn't have backlight, I imagine it should last a few weeks of moderate use.\n\nBecause I did not check out other electronic dictionaries, like those from Casio or Sharp, I cannot do a comparative review.  Let me just say that I regret not having done more homework before I made the purchase.  I really should have compare-shopped.  I took a blind trust in the Franklin name and, frankly, I'm rather disappointed.  For close to $100, I expected more in terms of quality and dictionary capacity.  (I personally don't care for its bell-and-whistle features.)";Decent, but not excellent, and here's why
41;45.0;4.0;10.0;761;I found myself fumbling for the dictionary every time I came across a word that I was not sure of the meaning or usage.  I am embarrassed to say that it happened more that I thought it would.  I also found myself looking up words I THOUGHT I knew only to find they had slightly different meaning than I thought.\n\nFrom my perspective there are only three major negatives\n\n1. the speech portion is not a clear as one would like and more in line with the tone of a very, very early computer generated voice (think of the voice from the movie War Games)\n\n2. While there is some odd sort of way to connect this to your computer it requires mailing in some form and getting an odd non-standard dongle.  While this may not be a big deal for some it would be nice to download an update from time to time\n\n3. The personal word list is great but way, way to limited at approx. 25 entries\n\nIf you can get past those items, it's a great device.;A very handy tool for anyone who reads alot

The screen is bad, pronunciation is bad, and it lacks some major features.\n\nOne is incremental search: while you type the first few letters of a word, it should jump to the appropriate section of the dictionary and show you a list of words that start with the prefix. This is useful mainly because you may not know the exact spelling and try several spellings. It doesn't have that.\n\nAlso you can't navigate through the description. Suppose you have\n\n  word1:  .... description word2 more desc word3\n\nyou should be able to use the arrow keys to jump immediately to ""word2"" or ""word3"" without having to type all of it.\n\nNot recommended.";bad, bad

However, I think it should be mentioned that in order to do the really cool stuff with this unit, (download e-books), you need to have the connectivity kit---and this unit does not come with one.

Nothing but if you want to be picky ""who"" as pronounced by this dictionary sounds like ""flu"" Only in isolation, but in a context i.e. type in & press speak icon ""he who did this deed is a good man"" It becomes unnoticeable. Anyway it's the difficult words you want to know how to pronounce.

I really enjoy this gadget and I'm sure you will too. P.S. don't believe any one that says the words are too small press ""Menu"" than ""Tools"" icon than ""Type Size"" (small, medium, or large) the trade off is the number of sentence lines on the screen i.e. (11, 8, or 6).

56;12.0;4.0;28.0;1098;"Overall: I bought this as a substitute for a bulky paper dictionary - just to look up words as I'm reading.  For this purpose it is nice.  If you want to know how a word is pronounced, however...  well, here's a letter I wrote to Franklin:\n\n===================\n\nDear Sir or Madam:\n\nAs an owner of several Franklin products, I am familiar with the company's commitment to quality electronics.  I recently purchased the SCD-1870 electronic dictionary and generally have been satisfied with the unit.  It is the most extensive handheld dictionary I have found yet, and I have occasion to use a dictionary frequently.\n\nHaving read reviews of the product from several sources, I anticipated that the speaking function would give ambiguous pronunciations.  Thus I was pleased to see (on the product's packaging, figure 1) that a textual pronunciation key would accompany each word (as occurs in all the other electronic dictionaries that I have encountered).\n\n[figure 1]\n\nI now believe that this is not the case, and that the speech function was intended to replace the text pronunciation.  I appreciate the advances in speech technology, but this design leads to several disappointing consequences.\n\nFirstly, pronunciations can be ambiguous:\n\nCh- often sounds like sh-, as in champion.\n\nSecondly, uncommon pronunciations can be chosen:\n\nEschew appears to be pronounced is-`choo, which is the fourth pronunciation listed on the Merriam Webster web site.\n\nThirdly, pronunciations can be incorrect:\n\nHors d'oeuvre appears to be pronounced `or-""duv-r& rather than or-'d&rv, the only pronunciation listed on the Merriam Webster web site.\n\nLastly, no pronunciation may be included:\n\nI had to refer to a normal dictionary to find the pronunciation for hacek.\n\nThe second most common reason I refer to the dictionary is to learn the definitive pronunciation for a word, and while the speech function is passable for most applications, I feel I was misled by the product's advertisement.  Including a pronunciation in the text of each entry would be a definite improvement to the unit for the reasons listed above, and for the increased convenience of not needing headphones in the library or other quiet place.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with the product's expansive lexicon and accurate definitions, and with its expandability and word games.  However, I may not have paid full price had the packaging not depicted the presence of in-text pronunciation.  I appreciate your attention to this matter.\n\n============================";Not bad for a dictionary
57;58.0;5.0;7.0;1110;Put simply, this electronic dictionary has significantly more words than any other electronic dictionary on the market.

Still, the best out there. Leave the big books home.;Excellent!
61;23.0;5.0;22.0;1241;"Let me start off by saying that I have owned both the Franklin SCD-1870 and the MWD-1450.  After using the 1450 for about a week, I returned it to the store where I purchased it.\nI will present this review as a comparison between the Franklin SCD-1870 and the MWD-1450.\nContent:\nThe winner is the 1870.  You know that the 1870 has a larger database by the specifications, but it really becomes apparent when you use the device.  With the 1450, many words are available for lookup, but it only tells you the part of speech.  To find the definition, you have to access the thesaurus for a brief definition with synonyms.  So far, the 1870 has contained every definition that I have asked from it, with the exception of some modified words.  For example, if you search for `ardently,' it will only return that it is an adverb.  If you want the definition, you have to enter the root, or `ardent.'\nOthers have mentioned the 1450's lack of phonetic spellings, which I did find to be a disappointment.  The 1870 also lacks the printed phonetics, but makes up for it with the speaking ability.  On the topic of speaking, the 1870 does pretty well.  It is a little quite, but I think that is a good thing.  I don't have to worry about accidentally speaking a word too loudly in the office.  The synthesized voice is a little hard to follow while reading the definitions due to an unnatural flow.  Some words are spoken with no space between them, while others leave a  second between words.\nThe 1870 has a lot more to offer past the dictionary and thesaurus capabilities, most of which I don't have much use for.  It has a menu for ""Signs, Symbols and Tables"" that lists lots of... well, signs, symbols and tables.  The content varies from the astronomical symbols used to label the planets on a sky chart, to the start-dates of the Jewish calendar, to the books of the Bible, to the elements of the Periodic Table.  Could be useful to some, but I don't find myself needing to access that information very much.\nBoth have some word games, with the 1870 having at least twice as many as the 1450.  They both use cheesy graphics for transitions (winning or losing a game) that you can easily turn off.  Due to the poor screen of the 1450 (see below) I did not spend much time on the games.  The 1870's games are entertaining.  One feature that I miss from the 1450 is a ""Word Learning"" option.  It was sort-of like a ""word of the day,"" except it would give you a new word every time you powered up (I guess you could call it ""word of the session"").\nI will not comment on the organizer capabilities of each device because it is something that I personally have no use for.  I can imagine, however, that this feature would have been helpful while I was a high school student (10 years ago!).\nScreen:\nWith the number of electronic devices incorporating LCD's today, the quality to cost ratio is usually extremely high.  Not so, however, with the 1450.  The screen is MISERABLE.  Aside from the inconvenient screen size, the quality simply sucks.  You have to have absolutely perfect lighting to read the screen with ease; lighting that I do not have in my office or next to my bed at home.  It was my sole reason for returning the 1450.\nThe 1870 on the other hand, has a screen that is clear, legible, and a pleasure to read, and is much larger and more efficient at providing information -that's what I expect.\nErgonomics:\nI initially preferred the horizontal layout of the 1450, but have grown to favor the vertical design of the 1870.  The vertical arrangement makes it natural to hold in one had while navigating the system.  The 1450's keyboard is easier to use since the buttons are larger and spaced further apart.  However, the buttons seem like the printing will wear off very quickly.  On the 1870, the buttons manageable.\nConstruction:\nHere, I would have to favor the 1450 for its cover.  It is hard and opens and snaps shut with ease.  I would have no worries dropping it into my pocket and forgetting that it was there.  The 1870 has a semi-soft cover that just flips around from the front to the back.  It is convenient, but it doesn't protect the screen and buttons as well and the attachment feature seems rather flimsy.\nThe 1450 tries to be high-tech with `touch-screen technology.'  It is a waste.  You can clearly see the wiring lines on the screen that make it function, and you end up with lots of fingerprints and smudges at the bottom of the already crowded screen.  The 1870 uses much more robust dedicated buttons below the screen to access the menu items.\nFor use on a desk, I prefer the 1870.  The 1450 was nice... until you start typing.  While pressing the letters to the outside, the unit rocks side-to-side, which gets annoying.  The 1870 can lay nice and flat, and can easily be propped up for easy viewing as seen in all of the advertising photos.  In this position, it is not practical to enter or scroll through information.\nRecommendation:\nBoth units provide sufficient value to the user.  The MWD-1450 would be more suited for a younger user, perhaps elementary students up to high school.  The hard cover makes it that much more rugged and able to withstand the abuse of a backpack.  Also, children are less demanding on quality and ease of use and are less likely to complain about the poor screen.  From high school on up, the SCD-1870 is the definite winner.  It has a far greater ease of use, many more functions, and a larger content that is demanded at a higher level.\nOverall, the 1450 is OK and the 1870 is GREAT.  Enjoy!";An Extremely Useful Tool - Highly Recommended
62;1.0;5.0;739.0;1282;First of all, let me warn you. There are at least two models of Franklin-Merriam Webster's Dictionary. The cheap one (list price $59.99) is worth less than $20. The expensive one (list price $99.99) is worth $300 or more.\nThe cheap model is a VERY bad deal for two reasons:\n(1) The display is very difficult to read (even configured with large type size).\n(2) It is lacking in vocabulary. What is the point of carrying along a dictionary that ignores the meaning of 100,000 words?\nThe expensive model is a wonderful deal for several reasons:\n(1) The display is excellent even in the small print size. I spend hours playing games and my eyes don't get strained.\n(2) It has twice the vocabulary of the cheaper model (200,000 words) and it pronounces the words.\n(3) It has several powerful dictionary and thesaurus tools and a cornucopia of extra features laid out in a very friendly interface.\n(4) It has several Learning Tools, including the SAT word list, flashcards, speaking spelling bee and a grammar guide.\n(5) You can add words to the dictionary if you want to. It also accepts book cards.\n(6) After looking up a word in the dictionary, you can add it to your personal list and review it as a flash card. What a great idea!\n(7) It has 12 educational vocabulary games that are a lot of fun. Each game  has five levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert and wizard. You can also configure the games to use only the SAT vocabulary.\n(8) It also has a calculator, metric converter, a clock and a databank. Each one of the extras is easy to find and yet do not compete with the dictionary. Every time you turn the machine on it works by default as a dictionary. Perfect!\nOK folks, now the bad news. While the cheap model is easy to find, you won't find the expensive model in most computer stores, even the large ones. So most customers end up buying the wrong model, like I did.\nFor some reason, most shop owners do not leave expensive electronic products on display. If the machine costs around 100 dollars, they hide it in a secret chamber. I bought the cheap model because it was the only one I could find. Later on I ordered the top Franklin model from Amazon.\nAll Franklin models have a similar name. I noticed that some Amazon reviewers who gave this product a low rating were actually writing about a different model. So don't get yourself confused. Make a note of the full name of the top model:  Franklin Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 11th edition Speaking.;Attention!  Make Sure You Buy the Right Model.
63;29.0;4.0;20.0;1339;I got this device as a dictionary book replacement so I can take it with me everywhere. It excedeed all my expectations. The number of words is astonishing. The keys on keyboard, although small, are up to the job. It also includes the voice pronunciation for all the words. The pleasant surprise was the presense of other features, some are useful, some not. For example, it provides words synonyms, antonyms and other related words. It provides correction for misspelled words: in many cases it gives a choice of a few corrections. You can store the words you were interested in. The device also contains various games and other simple programs, such as calculator, currency converter, etc. My only complaint is the size of the screen, which is not very big. Very often the information fills more than one screen so you have to scroll it. The scrolling mechanism is not the most convenient one. I would imagine something like Apple iPod has would be better. But for this price you probably cannot get anything better. All in all it is a portable dictionary that works very well.;Extremelly useful!
64;7.0;3.0;53.0;1402;This little dictionary is very convenient to use, but the display is hard to read. It has black lettering on a dark gray background and there's also usually some glare on the screen from the reading light source. My grandson's Gameboy SP has a much better way of displaying content for about the same price. Franklin should adopt it. No way would I ever try to read a book on this thing (I'd go blind), so forget the book card reader function. The pronunciation feature is nice, except that the electronic pronouncer sounds muffled, as though the speaker had marbles in her mouth. Think Sean Connery or Michael Mc Donald. Sometimes certain consonants are mispronounced. The games were wasted on me and the calculator is too awkward to bother with. I have no need for a clock, currency converter, etc. I wear a watch and hang out mostly where dollars are accepted. I'd rather have common latin and french phrases translated than have all these useless gadgets. Franklin would have done better to focus strictly on convenience for the kind of reader that uses a dictionary. Kids who use dictionaries will use their Gameboys for games. The letters of the keyboard could have been spaced a bit further apart for easier use and avoidance of errors. I have the feeling it was designed for fingers about half the size of mine and I'm a small female. (I also would have preferred the Dvorak keyboard, but I understand that very few people would find that appealing.)\nI'm glad I have this, even though it is hard to read (my main criticism), but I think I paid too much (I paid $99, felt sort of cheated when it went on sale for $89 so soon after my purchase, and truly feel it's worth more like $50). Had I known how hard to read it is I'd have still bought it if it had cost less. Still, it's very nice not to have to search through a heavy, thick dictionary. When I'm reading away from home this is very, very convenient. Okay, maybe it's worth $60.\nI gave it 3 stars, but 3 1/2 would be more accurate. The 5 star ratings threw me off and left me disappointed after my own experience of this dictionary.;hard to read
65;39.0;4.0;16.0;1423;"This is a great translator, have a lot of options and the pronunciation is so clear. The only problem, I think is speed! It's pretty slow specially when you use the ""Back"" bottom.";Great Job!

67;48.0;5.0;13.0;1445;Can't say enought good things about this Electronic Dictionary. I've been waiting for them to get it right and they succeeded! Highly recommended. I keep it nearby while reading and use it all the time.... this one won't sit in your drawer... it's actually useful. Has a great screen that is very close to an actual dictionary entry. Kudos, Franklin... you did a great job on this one! Thought it was a little expensive until I started to use it, now I think it was a bargain!;Electronic Dictionary Done Right!
68;18.0;5.0;28.0;1447;"I just received my Franklin's Electronic 11th Collegiate Dictionary, and already it is indispensible to my activities.  The hand-held user-friendly device is a comprehensive dictionary with voice-activated pronounciation of words and defintions;  additionally, it is a mighty useful and expansive thesaurus.\nSupplementary features include word games, a calculator, a grammar guide, a table of signs and symbols, a currency converter, a World Clock, a BOOKMAN book card feature, and learning tools designed to help a student study for the SAT or increase one's spelling acumen.  It displays confusables, antonymns, homophones, and pre-fixes/suffixes.  Moreover, if you want to use it as a name and address database, there is a program for data storage (and secret password entry, if you desire).\n\nThe letters are arranged like a keyboard instead of alphabetically.  Since the keyboard is too small to prop your hands on (like a computer), it would be my preference to arrange them alphabetically.  I reasoned, however, that the keyboard arrangement (as well as the speaker) is designed to be user-friendly for the sight-impaired.  I only wish that they had designed it both ways, giving the buyer a choice.\nMy only salient complaint is that the optional PC connectivity kit that you can purchase for $7.95 (includes Desktop Software, an expansion card, serial cable,  AC adaptor, and pc software to allow you to download eBooks, magazines, language translators, etc.) is not Mac compatible.\nRegardless, I will keep this literary-friendly gadget velcroed to my personage!";A powerful, portable tool

This is the best feature I like, because it saves me time and energy. As long as it spelled as it is pronounced, the computer will give you choice of words.\n4. Looking for sets of words, just press * plus the starting or ending of the word and you will get list of them. (example: *ile, will give you words from agile to exile!\n5. It pronounces the word.\n6. Very handy tool and lots of clear, down-to-earth definitions.\n7. Very good gift for those who like to read, write, study, or just have fun with words. Remember words have power!;Portable, instant, and lots of definitions- Dictionary!

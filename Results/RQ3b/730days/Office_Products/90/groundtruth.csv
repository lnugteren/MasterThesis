0;6.0;1.0;5.0;0;I've used Quicken since the 80's and relied on it. For the past few years the product has become unreliable but I'm committed as I have decades of history. I would recommend not buying it if you haven't used it before, and look at alternatives if you have. I have issues every day with missing transactions, crashes, inability to balance accounts, failed downloads from accounts, and an increasingly difficult interface. It isn't worth the time to contact support as they simply email common fixes or say they want to understand more about a problem but generally never follow up. In order to continue using it for bill payments you need to upgrade every 18 months or so, but the upgrades either take away functionality or break things that work.;Unless you have committed yourself to Quicken, run away
1;63.0;1.0;5.0;136;"I""ll add my voice to the chorus of boos over Intuit's policy of forced upgrades (or suffer lost ability to download transactions) every 3 years.  It would be one thing if they continually improved the product, but it only gets worse over time: more bloated, more bug-ridden, and less secure.\n\nI upgraded to this version on my PC (from Quicken 2012) a week ago.  In that time, the two credit cards for which I downloaded transactions BOTH got compromised and incurred fraudulent transactions!  I've never had a compromised card in my 40 years of using credit cards (and 30 years of using Quicken)... and the ONLY thing these two cards had in common was my use of Quicken 2015 (I haven't used them both at the same store for months).  Draw your own conclusions.  And keep an eye out on Brian Krebs' security blog to see if this version of Quicken doesn't show up as the next big hit on credit cards (just as Intuit's companion product, Turbo Tax, has on fraudulent tax refunds).\n\nI've been using Quicken since the DOS days when it was a fine product.  Now that it has no real competition, Intuit has gotten incredibly greedy, produced increasingly sloppy code, and no longer seems to care about the customer at all.  As soon as a decent competitive product emerges, I will be casting Intuit aside (Quicken and Turbo Tax Online) forever.  Intuit should serve as a case study in business schools for how to destroy a product.";Terrible Company, Terrible Product, Potential Security Risk
2;68.0;1.0;5.0;149;I've been a Quicken user for years with few complaints. However, I was informed by Intuit that if I didn't upgrade from Quicken 2012 to 2015 by TOMORROW, I wouldn't be able to download transactions from my bank into Quicken. So, I did the conversion, and know this: this version SUCKS! It corrupted the data of one of my two bank accounts, and now does not auto-reconcile. So, the new version is actually WORSE than the old one. Try to find another way to manage your finances - I am.;Don't buy this!
3;69.0;1.0;5.0;149;Buyer Beware!  I have used Quicken for years and years and dutifully upgraded when new versions became available.  This is the first time that Quicken has introduced an onerous splash screen demanding registration and answers to personal survey questions that you absolutely cannot work around in order to use Quicken as a local client.  This happens after your current product is uninstalled and your files imported into this version.;Quicken Deluxe 2015 - downloaded from Amazon
4;70.0;1.0;5.0;157;Question:  What's worse than a financial record system that won't run?  Answer: one that runs but produces wrong answers when you least expect it.  That's the problem with Quicken.  I have been using Quicken since 1995.  Everything seemed to be working well -- with an occasional little problem.  Then, about 2014 the system became very unreliable.  Transfers between accounts disappear.  Account balances in the account register don't agree with the account balance report -- for the same account and same date.  I have concluded that I must find another system to track my finances.;Dangerous unreliable system

Hit the the blue ""Automatic Entry is on"" and turn it off for all accounts. Then the unaccepted transactions were accessible to accept. I have seen this problem mentioned in your user blogs. Your help line service was unfortunately useless on this problem, and requested me to pay for a service contract to have them manually download my transactions into to my Quicken.

I have a very secure password for Quicken online (which I've never desired to use except to activate software).  Now I have to use the very secure password at home, which means I can no longer simply memorize the vault password.  Kind of defeats the purpose.  Having a memorable password means my data isn't safe on Quicken's servers (hell, it may not be safe even with a good password).\n\nOn first run, I tried to upgrade my Quicken 2013 data, but the program hung every time.

I have also used Quicken for years (haven't budged from 2013 due to the horrid reviews on just about every site imaginable, including Amazon, Facebook, etc.  I helped a friend install her new and ""improved"" Quicken 2015 last weekend.  I was absolutely astounded at the number of obvious bugs and issues with the application. Quicken is no longer a quality application, and I would never, EVER recommend it to anyone.  Someone mentioned a class-action suit against them.  I'm sure my friend would be happy to join the effort!  I will definitely NOT be moving away from my ""old"" version of Quicken (apparently it's from an historical time when they cared about quality and customer service!).  I have worked with numerous financial systems, both small and very, very large, but I've never seen such trash as Quicken 2015!";Quicken 2015 is a piece of GARBAGE!
10;48.0;1.0;9.0;206;After about two decades of using Quicken and regularly upgrading, I am kicking Intuit to the curb. I upgrade when I want. Period. The last time was June 2012 for Quicken. There has been nothing in newer versions to make it worthwhile to pay for an upgrade. Intuit / Quicken doesn't like that and tried to strong arm me into purchasing version 2015. Unless it's free, I don't want version 2015. It has nothing for me, but I received notice today that if I don't open my wallet and give them $20, they will take away features from my 2012 version.  I have to upgrade or lose the ability to download transactions. In order to continue using that feature, I have to buy it again? Business must be bad to resort to bullying. I'm jumping from Intuit's sinking ship and looking at other options. If I find nothing, I'll rather use a spreadsheet than go back to Quicken. I know that if you give a bully your lunch money today, he'll try to force you again tomorrow and every following day. Nope, I'm standing up now and saying: Hey Intuit / Quicken, get the * out of here and go pick on someone your own size.\n___________________________\n**UPDATED**\nI rolled over and now have 2015. It's so depressing when they get you by the short hairs. Now here's the funny part. In the teeny, tiny, ittsy, bitsy print, it states that the download feature, that is working for me again (yeah!) is only good through 2018 (whaaaaaat?). Can you dig it? The product I bought is only good through 2018 and then I'll have to buy it again. PLEASE PEOPLE, be strong and hang long, don't go with Quicken. They will own your soul.

12;77.0;1.0;5.0;209;"Intuit recently informed me they will not support connected services for Quicken 2012 after April 30, and offered me an ""upgrade"" to Quicken 2015 for $54.99 (which anybody can buy at Amazon for $42.55).  I've been down that road, and I don't have a reason to jump onto that treadmill again for any price.\nI started with Quicken in 1994 when Intuit made high quality software and supported it, a distant memory.  I now run Quicken 2012.  I spite of many frustrating hours of effort I was never able to get connected services to work.  I managed to get Quicken to connect with some financial institutions, but even then transactions downloaded correctly were outnumbered by duplicate transactions, missing transactions and transactions posted to the wrong accounts.  Neither I nor the financial institutions were able to resolve the problems ourselves or get any worthwhile assistance from Intuit; I just wasted hours trying.  Thus the connected services were and are valueless, so I won't lose anything on April 30.  With less time and much less frustration I set up scheduled transactions with dummy amounts and manually edit them after each transaction is completed; essentially manually entering the transactions with a lot less clerical effort.  For an ordinary Joe Public with an IRA, a few investments I don't actively manage day-to-day, and some bills to pay every month I guaranty that manual method is less time consuming and frustrating than going through the process of debugging the Quicken connected services installation every three years.  After my unsuccessful experience trying to get connected services to work without help from Intuit, I skipped the last two annual Quicken ""upgrades"" and I don't have any problems.\nQuicken 2015 doesn't add any significant capability; reviews indicate connection services usability is still a frustrating crap-shoot; and customer service has actually gotten worse, eliminating all phone support.  So why buy Quicken 2015?  If you have a version of Quicken running and stable, be thankful.  Do yourself a big favor and NEVER ""upgrade"" again.  Let Intuit keep their bug-filled connected services, unless you actively trade and really need daily price updates.  Use your old stable version of Quicken to set up scheduled transactions and edit them manually.  Your cardiologist will thank you.\nAs long as the money rolls in, they just don't care, and neither the product nor the support will get any better.  So, stop ending money.";Quicken Support Issue Resolution
13;27.0;2.0;14.0;210;"This will probably be a lot longer than any of my past reviews, but I want to make sure that others don't have as bad an experience as I did.  I have been a Quicken on a PC since Quicken 99.  I used it for more than 5 years before that on a Mac.  So I am not unfamiliar with the product.  I almost upgraded from my trusty Quicken 2012 day before yesterday when I purchased Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014.  But the bundle wasn't available when purchasing a PC download which I prefer.  I purchased it yesterday when I received an ominous email from Intuit telling me that my automatic download functions would cease to function at the end of April.  Luckily, the PC download version from Amazon was as good a deal (when coupled with Turbo Tax download) as the Intuit ""good deal"".\n\nBacked up my data files to another hard drive before starting and then executed the upgrade program.  Actually things seemed to go pretty smoothly at first.  The only problems I had were a slightly irritating second password associated with Quicken I had never encountered before.  But at the very end of the install, I was pleased to see that the program recognized that I had a separate password associated with the Password Vault that was different from the password associated with my Quicken ID.  I opted to use that password associated with the Quicken ID for both and finished up.  So far so good.\n\nI started quicken up and proceeded to browse the new product and compare what I was seeing with what I was used to seeing.  Given that Intuit had almost three years to fiddle with Quicken I was really surprised how little had changed.  The only REAL issue that I had was the removal of the 2012 check box that allowed you to remove any particular account from the Net Worth calculation.  I found the Separate category performed this function an it seemed to do what I wanted.  I also disliked the fact that the ""hidden"" account aren't really ""hidden"", but tucked under an necessary drop down window.  But again, tolerable.\n\nThe next morning found me using my new Quicken for the first time with my daily budgeting process.  Step one was to download all new transactions to my computer.  At this point things got nasty.  When I started the automatic update, the window popped up for the Intuit ID Password, as I had expected.  Unfortunately when I put in the password, the ""Operation Failed"".  Even though I knew the password was correct.  Just for grins, I entered my Password Vault password... but that failed also.  I tried signing onto Quicken with the Quicken ID and same password and it worked perfectly.  Time to call Tech Support.  I went to the Quicken help page and after putting in my symptoms I got hooked up via live CHAT.\n\nThe young lady on the CHAT line was very bright and quite knowledgeable about Quicken.  The first thing she did was do a Verify on my data file to make sure it wasn't corrupted.  It wasnt.  After a few more tweeks (she was controlling my computer from afar), she declared it was time to bring in Quicken Technical Support.  You can imagine my surprise, since I had contacted her FROM the Quicken technical support website.  She informed me that she was a third party tech and didn't work for Intuit/Quicken.  That didn't surprise me much.  But what she said next totally FLOORED ME!  She said that in order to bring Quicken Support on to help, I needed to be subscribed to one of their support plans that ranged from about $100 to $350, depending upon how long I wanted the plan to be in effect.  This was to support a piece of software that I had just purchased or $41.00 from Amazon.  I really thought there was just a misunderstanding at first, but quickly realized that was not that case.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor at that point.\nAbout 10 or 15 minutes later the Supervisor came on line.  He explained, again, that they didn't work for Quicken (he never mentioned Intuit) and that they were 3rd Party support.  When I pointed out that Quicken was paying them to provide support he QUICKLY said NO that was not true.  Nobody was paying them to provide this support.  I guess the work ethic in Pakistan or India or wherever this gent was is a lot stronger than here in the States.  I didn't have any more to say.\nThe GOOD NEWS is that I was able to fix my problems with Quicken 2015 on my own with a little help from the web.  But I would bet that the average Joe would not have been so lucky.  I don't know how Customer Support in this country sank to the levels that now exist but If there were a decent replacement for Quicken, I would be entertaining it now.  This response is way too long for Amazon to post on the review section but I have seen really long ones before.  I am going to ask them to post it\n\nRobert S.";Problems with Quicken Deluxe 2015
14;78.0;1.0;5.0;210;Intuit has chosen to rip off their customers by requiring them to upgrade to the next higher-priced version of Quicken to get the functionality formerly available in the Deluxe version.

15;55.0;1.0;7.0;211;Don't waste your money on Intuit/Quicken.  It's their official policy to disable the online functionality of their software after 3 years, effectively crippling it.  Buy this now and you'll have to do it again in three years.  They've learned nothing about customer support and they're greedy little @!!%#s.  Just check their own Facebook Page.\n\nThere was the recent fiasco with TurboTax where they cut out major functionality forcing people to upgrade and shell-out for the same level of capability.  Now, I've just received an email saying they're discontinuing all online services for Quicken 2012 such as downloading my bank statements.  That's only three year old!  And it's not even the banks saying they don't want to support an old format, it's Intuit basically deciding that three years is enough use of their software so you should pay them again to continue using it.\n\nFurthermore, if you run into any trouble and need help, know that they do not have ANY phone number you can call.  That's right, no support or customer service. Zero. Nada.  Everything circles back to their forums, which seem to be largely ignored by any actual Quicken employee.  The only way to reach anyone is to go through the motions of purchasing an upgrade until you find a link to chat (IM style) with a sales agent.\n\nI'm fed up with them.  I'll be looking for alternatives and I highly suggest you do too.;Greedy Buggers, Not Worth Your Time or Money

Here is my story:\n\nFEB 2, 2015:\nQuicken has abolished phone support! I just spent over an hour trying to CHAT my way to resolution on a very basic problem that is inexplicably gob-smacking for them. Here is what happened:  My bank changed their log in system and made me select a new username and password.  Once I did that, I attempted to update Quicken, but now it won't connect to that bank.  Something in the Quicken software doesn't like the change and though I can log in to the bank hrough a web browser just fine, in Quicken it won't work.  Now I have to wait 3-5 days for some advanced department to review my log files and get back to me.

18;59.0;1.0;7.0;229;I have been using Quicken for about 10 years. Until the 2015 version, I was a loyal Intuit user. When I upgraded to Quicken 2015 from Quicken 2013, I discovered that you must sign in to your Intuit account and provide personal information such as your mailing address to use the product. I did have my Quicken 2013 version linked to their cloud service and was happy to have that as an optional feature. However, with Quicken 2015 I was unable to install the product or access my local financial data without signing in to a Quicken on-line account and providing extra personal information.\n\nIntuit really broke trust with me by holding my local financial information hostage. I immediately requested a refund and went back to Quicken 2013 until I can find an alternative solution. I am sad that one my long-time favorite brands thought they could force me to provide personal information. What was a great optional feature that I used in Quicken 2013 became the deal breaker for me in 2015.

I appreciate being able to manage all my finances in a single place, download the transactions across all my accounts, and create reports that show how and where I spend my money.  However, what I don't appreciate is being pretty much forced to now upgrade Quicken on an annual basis, whether I want to or not.  I was running Quicken 2014, which I only installed about 6 months ago.  As usual, the endless reminders about needing to upgrade to Quicken 2015 started at the beginning of January.  Unchecking the dialog box that says, ""Remind me later."" is meaningless, since the same dialog box will then come up each time you open Quicken, regardless of what you've checked.  Therefore, to stop that irritation, I went ahead and bought Quicken 2015, which looks pretty much like Quicken 2014 to me.  Which looked pretty much like Quicken 2013.  Intuit should just announce that Quicken is now an annual license and quit fooling around like this.\n\nHere's a useful tip for anyone that is planning to upgrade from Quicken 2014 to Quicken 2015.  If your Quicken password has special characters in it ($, #, @, etc.) CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD TO REMOVE THOSE CHARACTERS IN QUICKEN 2014 BEFORE YOU LOAD QUICKEN 2015!  Otherwise, during the installation of Quicken 2015, your Quicken 2014 installation will be completely removed.  You will then try to open your Quicken data file in Quicken 2015 and you will be told your password is invalid.  You will try it about 10 more times before you refer to the Intuit site for help.  You will then find a lot of useless posts on how to change your password on Intuit.com, but nowhere will you be told that the geniuses at Intuit forgot to make sure that Quicken 2015 can open a 2014 file secured by a password with special characters.  This same thing happened a couple years ago, so evidently their learning curve is low.  Your only option at that point appears to be to dig out your copy of Quicken 2014, open your Quick data file, change your password to one without special characters, save the file, re-open the file successfully in Quicken 2015, then change your password back to something more secure that uses special characters.  That's super-convenient, isn't it?\n\nIf you remove the special characters in your password BEFORE you start the installation of Quicken 2015, it should go pretty smoothly for you.";IMPORTANT: CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD TO REMOVE ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN QUICKEN 2014 BEFORE YOU LOAD QUICKEN 2015!

In fact, you can't even install it if you don't create an account with Quicken.  I am done using Quicken products.  It's bad enough that every few years they stop supporting their previous versions (in fact, 2012 stops working pretty much completely spring 2015), but then, they have the audacity to make us pay full price for their products and don't even offer their customers an upgrade price.  It's a huge ripoff.  There are other financial software products out there that can compete with Quicken and let you opt out of any of the creating accounts, etc.  If you don't mind having all of your finances online as well as your personal computer... well, that's your deal and maybe this is for you.  (And after contacting Quicken they really couldn't confirm or deny that the copy on your computer isn't always hooked to their servers... I don't feel comfortable or secure in this at all).  To be fair, the software works for the most part, but load times are clunky now and there are a lot of hesitations in it when minimizing the window, etc.  This is the case on both my Windows 7 and my Windows 8 systems.

As DOS and Windows upgraded, so did Quicken along with more enticements that made the newer product version much better.  However, I HAD  to upgrade to 2015 over the 2012 version only b/c Intuit was no longer allowing 2012 users internet support/upgrades after just 3 years of use.  After purchasing online and upgrading, the latest version is slower to load and presents the same home screen information as the 2012 version with a few minor changes, none of which I really needed (don't need to know my credit scores by releasing private information to Intuit in order to get something my card company already provides me). All the other key features were already present in the 2012 home screen.  I know software companies have to provide some new enticing product every few years to stay competitive, but I was extremely satisfied with 2012 Quicken deluxe.  Maybe 2018 deluxe will be more incredulous over 2015.;Latest and Greatest?  I don't think so
23;83.0;3.0;5.0;248;"At least once each week Intuit apparently insists on throwing up a window upon startup soliciting me to upgrade my current version of Quicken. This, of course, is incredibly annoying. There's a checkbox that says ""Remind me later"". I uncheck the box because I definitely will not be upgrading for at least two more years, although you never know what sort of anti-customer nonsense Intuit will think of next. Well, unchecking that box does nothing. I continue to endure that solicitation screen showing up every time I open Quicken. Apparently that little box is about as useful  pushing the Close Door button in an elevator. It doesn't work. It's like signing up for the Do Not Call list and still receiving endless calls from telemarketers trying to sell you home alarm systems and viagra. What does that say about Intuit and what does it say about Intuit's programmers? Either Intuit doesn't care that you don't want to receive constant solicitations to upgrade the product and support their executive salaries, or their programmers are so bad that they can't get a checkbox to work. Probably a combination of both.";Remind Me Later checkbox. Seriously Intuit?

I bought 2014 last year and immediately began struggling with it, despite being a 30 year IT veteran who has built and worked with complex software.  While many of the things it attempts to do are elegant in concept, it is a struggle to use them in practice; and there is effectively no support.  I bought 2015 hoping that it would improve things but they have only gone downhill.  After spending hours categorizing all my Amazon transactions for my credit card account, my checking account, for which downloading transactions had quit working, disappeared when I attempted to use their account reset function and Quicken locked up.  I had to cancel out of it to get it going again and the account was now nowhere to be seen.  I went through the process of re-adding the account but it still wouldn't show.  So, I tried to get help.  All that is available is online chat with what is clearly an overseas office.  Between quirks in the English being sent me and there not getting what I told them straightforwardly multiple times (the account is not showing in the account list!) it was very frustrating and I don't blame the person who was trying to help me.  However, the bottom line is the session was a waste of time doing trivial things and Intuit is not supporting this software.  To be clear, I am not trying to do anything exotic.  I have a credit card, checking and savings account.  I am just trying to download transactions, categorize them, and report on them against my budget in a way that is useful to me.  About the reporting piece:  you still are limited to using or slightly modifying one of their reports; there is no truly custom report capability.  Based on my experience I caution you on trying to use this software.  You will find it a waste of time and money.";Run, don't walk....

I have spoken with Quicken about it and their answer is the delete all accounts, loose all old data, and start again.  The amounts in the accounts are always incorrect, I have deleted the accounts from Quicken and then reinstalled the accounts and the amounts still post incorrectly.  It will import correctly from Discover card.  While the product is useful for tracking checks and expenses from checks, the product is almost useless for tracking you net worth.  I have used the product for several years and the problem persists.  I have put up with this because I purchase the product in a package with Turbo Tax.  But now Turbo Tax Deluxe has deleted forms previously included, so I am upset with TurboTax and will no longer use it when I have to pay for Premium.

27;31.0;5.0;13.0;251;I've been a Quicken customer since the very early 1990's. Was very concerned with the horrid reviews of this and a couple prior versions of the same product. Despite the negativity (there's really not much of a choice in this product category), I took the risk and upgraded from Quicken 2012. I'm pleased to say that the upgrade installed flawlessly and converted data from my prior version without incident or loss. The features that I use and rely upon continue to work very well.;Flawless Upgrade
28;60.0;1.0;7.0;254;Having used Quicken for almost 6 years, I should say this is the most horrible upgrade. I absolutely see no changes from the 2013 version. Absolutely nothing. I am glad I did not pay the full amount and bought for this discounted price on Amazon. No changes in the desktop app as well as in the mobile app. They need to make this available on more platforms other than Windows and Mac (Chromebooks etc). Shame on Quicken for asking people to pay money for nothing;Very disappointed
29;61.0;1.0;7.0;255;A little about me so you don't think I am incompetent. I have a masters degree, have used Quicken 2010 for two years, and I am an easygoing and patient man. I am also computer literate. The problem is Quicken, at least this version. As I type this (January 14, 2015) I have the most updated version R 4. I have spent last few days with customer service working on duplicate transactions, transactions not posting, and Quicken even crashing. I have searched the depths of the internet looking for answers, including Quickens online communities, and found that I am not alone with the issues I am experiencing. Rather, my experience seems to be very common.\n\nI have no problem paying $100 or more for this software, I just wished it worked. 2015 is very similar to the 2010 version I had. It is not like they completely redesigned this program, but still they have these fundamental problems? It is unacceptable. But what are we to do because Quicken is the only software that I am aware of that helps us track our finances. Mint.com (now owned by Quicken) quality has dropped of recent so I decided to purchase quicken 2015. My last stint with customer service was around 2 hours and at the end they told me they will have a technician call me in a week because they are unable to further assist me. We will see how that goes. Total hours spent with customer service around 7 hours. I will never see those 7 hours again and now I will have to spend more time with a technician on January 20, 2015.\n\nI write this because I hope some kid or entrepreneur will read this, decide there is a need for a quality product like this, and be a competitor to Quicken. Quickens quality has dropped to such a low level it is sad. I sincerely hope your experience is like the five star reviews some report on here but I just cant see how that is possible. If you decide to purchase this say hi to Ricky or Jane at customer service for me as I envision you will be speaking with them. Best of luck.;Software is not fit for sale as of January 13, 2015.

30;25.0;1.0;17.0;258;"I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I am so fed up with Intuit and Quicken that I am compelled to write this.  I've been using Quicken for nearly 20 years for the most basic, simple stuff:  tracking my purchases and account balances, and downloading them from my bank into Quicken for reconciliation.  No stocks, no investments, no reporting and net worth evaluations, no credit reports, no budgeting and planning.\n\nAs the versions have progressed, Quicken has become buggier and buggier.  It duplicates check numbers that I never entered.  It incorrectly marks transactions as 'cleared'.  Even the scrolling in many windows is just plain confusing (you scroll up, but the window scrolls down).  Contrary to company's name, it has become less and less intuitive.\n\nI have been using the ""Deluxe"" edition, which has way more bells and whistles than I use.  Yet the simpler ""Starter"" version will not let me import existing data from the Deluxe edition, so I have to pay for and use features I don't need.\n\nThe most frustrating thing about this software is that Intuit forces users to pay for an upgrade every 3 years!  They actually disable the functionality that allows us to download transactions from our bank after 3 years if we don't upgrade.  This is extortion.  I've held my nose and paid up for the last few cycles, but am so sick of this abuse of their customers this year that I'm not buying it again (for what would be the 5th time).  Intuit is losing me as a customer with their obnoxious tactics.\n\nI'm hoping that if enough people follow suit, that Intuit will change their policies.  Until then, sayonara Intuit.  If you are still inclined to buy Quicken, be prepared to buy it again in three years.  And three years after that.";"Buggy, bloated software; extortive tactics by Intuit."

No where on the box, or at Intuit's own product page for it, does it tell you that you have to have an INTUIT ID, one that is attached specifically to your Quicken file and your usage of said file.  Intuit apparently ""monitors"" you once you have the id.  Indeed, the HELP file included with this product clearly states that you do NOT have to have an INTUIT ID.  That may have been true in earlier versions, but this product's own help file still contains false and misleading info, info applicable to earlier versions.\n\nSorry, but financial info has no business being ""monitored"" by anyone but the info's owner.  Period.\n\nHaving had my identity stolen/compromised twice since late 2013 (thanks Target and Home Depot - lucky me), I refuse to have anything to do with a company who thinks it has the right to ""monitor"" me and the usage I have of its product, as well as tie my e-mail info directly into my Quicken file.  Add in the fact that Intuit claims ""safety"" of this info - not buying that either.\n\nIntuit - big mistake.  You should be honest in your product descriptions and in your packaging that you are required to give up personal info, and that the info is being constantly ""monitored"" as you use the product.  This is the 2nd major faux paus by Intuit in a single set of new versions - Turbo Tax being the other.\n\nHad I know of this id requirement upfront, I never would have made the purchase in the first place.";"Beware - required to have ""INTUIT ID"" before you can use this product."

While not perfect, it does everything I want it to do and has improved functionally and visually over the years. (How I miss printing checks on my dot matrix printer!)\n\nAfter reading yet another year of generally bad reviews of the newest Quicken, I was reluctant to upgrade. But last night, I took the plunge.

I stuck with the Deluxe version because I do not use mobile options; neither do I use any of the advanced investment tracking features. At one time I was a Premier user, but found it labor intensive to maintain and not very helpful. I have other investment services that provide an x-ray function, so I did not think that this added feature was worth the effort, cost, or risk increasing the features I currently use.\n\nMy install of Quicken Deluxe 2015 went well. All of my Quicken 2014 account data was converted successfully. Registers seem to be fine. My monthly reminders are still intact. My existing password vault still works fine (I do not use the Quicken password). Budget data looks fine. Debt pay down still intact. Investment data seems OK. A reconciliation of one account actually corrected an account balance problem that I was having with Quicken 2014. One Step Update worked. So far, so good.\n\nMy usage background & history:\nI believe I am one of the original Quicken users and have stuck with the product through the years. I stay with Quicken because it best suits my needs. During this time, I have had some significant problems in Quicken upgrades. Since I try to upgrade every year, I have learned to delay the upgrades until the initial onslaught of errors are found and hopefully corrected. Obviously, some upgrades have been extremely painful, others easy and error free. When I read the horror stories on the review sites, I always try to consider what version the user is upgrading from, the features they have had issues with, and the hardware they use before I make the purchase.\n\nWay back, I specifically chose my bank because it had Quicken compatible checking accounts. Use of Quicken is the centerpiece of my financial management and I needed a bank that supported that. I appreciate all of the online bill-pay services and access to financial institution data that Quicken gives me. There are only a few places that Quicken does not connect to, but even then, they sometimes have the transaction download format that loads into Quicken.\n\nMy hope is that Intuit will provide as much loyalty to its customers as we have towards their products.";Quicken Deluxe 2015 installed and runs without problems...
39;65.0;1.0;7.0;273;"I've used Quicken for decades and have come to dread updates, but try to keep on a supported version anyway. This time I'm sorry I did. After spending hours trying to get it working the way I like, I abandoned tracking my investments in Quicken. That's too bad, since I have a lot of history there, but I couldn't find a practical way to continue to maintain that history. Now I use Quicken only as a checkbook program. It still has a convenient checkbook balancing feature, as long as you stick with with manual data entry.\n\nThe basic problem is that, as they try to make it more automatic, they also make it more rigid. When it does something wrong (as just one example, downloading duplicates of probably hundreds of investment transactions I'd already entered), there's no practical way to fix the problem. Quicken assumes the history it created is right and ""protects"" you from yourself by making it hard or impossible to fix the incorrect history.\n\nAnother, smaller problem is that you must enter check numbers in the format they like. My electronic payments don't have check numbers, so I used to enter the confirmation number. It's unclear to me why not permitting that is an improvement.\n\nPayee name auto-complete no longer works for me. Actually, that started with my prior version of Quicken a short while before I updated, so probably it's file corruption or some setting I inadvertently changed, but anyway it's annoying.\n\nThe big problem, though, is what I started by describing.

It's incredibly slow, even on a 2014 MacBook Pro (running Windows 8.1) with a Core i7, 16 GB RAM and SSD drive, which is the fastest machine I've ever owned--and I've worked on a lot of computers.  I'm a 25-year IT professional/developer and this software is an embarrassment to the trade.  I was originally willing to put up with the performance but it can't even reconcile a credit card account from Chase Bank. It's extraordinarily buggy.

When I first installed the software, it would not stay connected with Wells Fargo.  After several hours of working with Quicken help, they decided the problem was my password.  I had an exclamation point in it.  Even though Quicken help stated an exclamation point was ok, the person assisting stated Wells Fargo accounts did not like any special characters.  So I eliminated the exclamation point and it worked, for a while.\n2.  About two months later, the software began to indicate Wells Fargo did not recognize my account name.  I de-activated the account and re-activated it.  Problem solved, for 24 hours.  I repeated this process for a couple of weeks, every day...then other accounts with Wells Fargo began to quit working.  First my mortgage, then my credit card.\n3.  I got on-line help from Quicken, who asked me to go through the same steps I had already gone through.  We then validated the file, then super validated the file, then deleted some of the accounts.  We then went through a process of re-branding the accounts.  Then they asked me to de-activate all Wells Fargo Accounts and re-activate them one by one.  I have about 20 accounts, so Quicken was doing this very slowly.  After a few accounts were re-activated, I noticed one of the accounts was shown as activated, but Quicken did not recognize it.  The response from Quicken was ""Great!""\n4.  The final blow was to create a new account and activate it on one of the existing accounts.  This created the account and downloaded the previous 87 days of transactions.  They then asked me to copy the remaining 9 months from the previous account into the new account.  I explained this would require me to re-categorize the last three months of data entries, many of which were split transactions.  They were unconcerned about the hours of work involved.  They declared it a success.\n5.  24 hours later I did a one-step update and it the new account failed.\n\nI upgraded from Quicken 2010.  I never had problems with it.

This is mostly annoying, as you can still do reconciles ok.\n\nWhen printing transactions from a bank (checking account), garbage values are shown in the report for amounts. This problem I cannot live with, as we balance our checkbook several times a month.\n\nI participated in two multi-hour sessions with Quicken support. I give them an A for effort/patience/politeness, but a D for solving the problems, or even being remotely interested in documenting almost-certain bugs in the software, for feedback to their software developers. After the second session, I uninstalled version 2015 and went back to ver 2012. Fortunately I made this move within a few days of the 2015 update so I had to renter only a few days of transactions.\n\nBottom line: This is the first time in 20 years that I had to back out a Quicken upgrade. I am disappointed in Intuit's quality assurance program. Some heads should roll in their software management.;"Too buggy; had to uninstall and go back to Quicken 2012."
45;86.0;2.0;5.0;299;"Let me preface this with I'm writing this review after having 9 months of bank transactions wiped out.  Transactions that were properly classified, culled and allocated.  How did this happen?  No one knows, all Intuit will ever say is the bank must have changed something.\n\nLast night I downloaded my weekly transactions and it said my main bank account had errors.  I went through the built-in resetting process and before you know it I have about 1000 duplicated transactions.  All the original transactions were reset, the splits and tags were all gone, even the custom memo's.\n\nI should be the software's job to protect the users information from issues like this but if you look back for YEARS, every version this was an issue, Intuit does nothing.  It's the same with there Quickbooks product although its much more stable, they do nothing to listen to the end users.  I would have picked up a copy of Quickbooks if it had the simple cash-flow projecting Quicken has always had, but again after a decade of people asking for it it does not.\n\nYou want to know what the next 10 million dollar app is?  Its not on a phone, its a desktop replacement for Quicken,  Ever since Microsoft threw in the towel with MS Money they've had no competition to gauge themselves against. Some would say go to Mint or some online version but there are a lot of people that\n\na. Don't trust cloud computing with their sensitive financial information.\nb. Actually need the fine grained control something like Quicken can potentially give but fails.\n\nAnyone who's used Quicken over the years can tell you little has been really brought into the product in terms of back end ""fixes"" or UI enhancements.  The software is still buggy, unresponsive and it's user interface is none standard.\n\nHere is my sincere recommendation:\n\nBuy this software for the cash flow projection module.  That's it.  Do not expect to be able to download transactions automatically for the time-savings reliability and expect not to be pulling your hair out constantly.\n\nBuy a 5 year old version of Quicken if you can find it for $10.  Setup your accounts, your account balances and future dated transactions to be able to project your cash-flow.  DO Not rely on it to tell you accurate balances, you have to enter those yourself whenever you reconcile your accounts.  Use Mint or Personal Capital as an aggregator of your accounts so you can stay mobile and see semi-realtime changes.\n\nGood luck and I hope this helps someone.";One of the worst pieces of software ever written.
46;37.0;1.0;13.0;303;I have been a Quicken user since 1997.  Although my 2012 version worked fine, I decided to upgrade in spite of the reviews because I wouldn't be using the new features.  Big mistake since I now have problems with bank account register entry, reconciliation and mutual fund share price update.  The file conversion appears to have been done correctly.  In the register, I added a tag to RMDs that I had previously entered.  After answering the IRA year question (2014), my ending balance for the mutual fund decreased by the total of my RMDs for the year.  I have previously added tags and this didn't happen.  I couldn't figure out how to correct this but recovered by restoring a  backup.  I received my bank statement and went to reconciliation.  During reconciliation I saw that the account difference total did not change as I cleared items.  I discovered that, if you do 'cancel' or 'finish later' and go back into reconciliation, the correct difference is shown and will work going forward.  Another irritation, although minor, is changing mutual fund share prices.  In 2012 the up and down arrows would highlight the entry so you could type over it instead of deleting the entry.  Now it is hit and miss.  These are very basic functions that no longer work as they used to.  The product makes me very uneasy about what I haven't discovered yet and doesn't inspire much confidence.  I worked in the computer field for 47 years and would have been ashamed to have my name associated with a product of this quality.  While checking several FAQs regarding problems, I discovered what sums up the product quality and should be the new product name - 'Sorry'.  Check the FAQs to see what I mean.  I will most likely pursue a refund shortly.\n\nUPDATE.\nMore bad news and some good news.  When you do a search in the bank register YOU MUST CLEAR the search field to be able to see your register properly again.  I printed the register later (preparation for reinstall of 2012) and found payments from positive 229 million to negative 145 million. And for some reason, most of the amounts were $32.00 and $82.00.  Now I have to go to my checkbook to recover my 2012 data.  Two pieces of good news.  One is for people foolish enough to still want it - Quicken dropped their price by $30 (hmm - wonder why?).  The other is that I found my 2012 installation CD - HELLO REFUND.;Save yourself the aggrevation  - don't waste your time and money

49;5.0;1.0;271.0;315;It's been changed this year.  You are forced to sign up for an Intuit account which puts your data on their cloud even if you don't want to.

50;87.0;1.0;5.0;316;I've used Quicken since at least 1998 and can say it's definitely gone downhill with each new version containing added bugs. Do you want previously hidden memorized transactions to not be viewable? Upgrade to Quicken 2011 or early versions of 2012. Do you want the data page on your investments to go blank? Current bug in 2015. The Android app is completely useless to me because you can't transfer to and from savings goals with it, and it's been around long enough now it should be a polished product. Since I use savings goals for moving numbers around for budgeting purposes the app is worthless for me to use for entering transactions on the go. Combine that with the reported bugs with Quicken 2015, including the problem where if a sync from the PC doesn't work properly you may not even be notified before Quicken just shuts down upon closing, and I uninstalled the app and disabled online sync capabilities in the software.  And as of Quicken 2015 you can't even activate the software to use without an Intuit ID and Internet connection! If there were a viable alternative to this garbage I'd jump ship today. I'll continue to watch for said alternative.;Worse with each update
51;23.0;1.0;21.0;320;Anyone who upgrades to 2015 will be FORCED onto the internet.  What Quicken does with your data is not clear and you certainly have no option to NOT connect to the net as opposed to previous versions where you could opt out of internet connectivity.  I do not want to trust anyone with ALL of my financial data and that is what Quicken 2015 forces you to do.  I tried to go back to Quicken 2012, but the data had already been corrupted and that older program could no longer read the data files.  In other words, I would have had to spend the rest of my day uninstalling, reinstalling and then importing old saved data just to avoid connecting to Quicken for the REQUIRED updates and who knows what else that they could then upload from my financial files.  I have been a loyal Quicken fan since they started.  I am now done with them (and Turbo Tax as well) since I do not want ALL of my financial data available online to anyone.

59;88.0;4.0;5.0;343;"I was VERY hesitant to purchase Quicken Deluxe 2015 based on the large number of negative experiences people have reported here on Amazon. I was also hesitant to purchase when the price started out at $75, which is the same price you find on the Quicken site at the time of this writing (Oct 17, 2014). That is simply too much and the reason I knocked off one star for my review. I feel sorry for those early adopters that jumped right away only to see the price drop 33% in a really short amount of time. I suppose they could return the software and re-purchase it for the savings but what a hassle. Ah the challenge of price-timing when shopping at Amazon!\n\nAs far as reviews go for years I've benefited from reading the reviews on Amazon and truly have been influenced on my purchases by all those comments and thought it was time to pay back for all those reviews I've read without contributing so I'm trying to step-it-up and write more of my own. I buy ALL my products for my own use. I have ZERO bias and give my honest feedback on my actual experiences.\n\nIn the case of Quicken Deluxe 2015 I jumped when the price hit $50 which, for me, is a reasonable price for the Deluxe edition.\n\nThe installation went fine, the translation of my Quicken 2013 Deluxe file went fine, the Credit Score worked fine, the mobile app (which I never used before) also went fine (and I really like that app), and, finally, the cloud sync also worked fine. I'm not sure why there have been so many challenges by other users but I do realize that computer systems are complex and there are a LOT of variable between various computer systems so maybe I was lucky.\n\nI am a ""simple"" user in that I use Quicken to have my own electronic record of our income and expenses AND to sync to our banks to ensure we agree. Any fraud will show up FAST if you sync often and keep an eye on things. For me, Quicken Deluxe does the trick (although I was a real fan of Microsoft Money and was sad when Microsoft dropped support for that product).\n\nI'm not a fan of ""sun-setting"" whereby a company discontinues support for software to force an upgrade; however, for me paying $50 every two years to stay current is not really a bad value for software I find so useful. On the flip side I truly do understand if the program is working to YOUR satisfaction it is a disappointment to be forced to upgrade just to be able to continue to sync to your financial institutions. Quicken would tell you ""No problem, you can always reconcile manually"" but, yea, right...why would you do that when you can sync and save a TON of time?!? That's one of the main features of this software, after all!\n\nI personally find this a worthy upgrade for $50. More than that...not so much. I've fortunately experienced NONE of the issues that have been reported here. You DO need some level of tech savvy to work with this, or any other complex program, but overall the experience for me has been much more positive than what most of the people here are reporting.

So, all in all, it's not perfect but it is pretty good.  You can take a look at Ace Money, Money Bank, etc. but overall Quicken offers a better product IMHO.\n\nOverall, I am giving it four stars.  Product is good, basic chat support I would still rate as barely adequate to adequate.  Follow up support is fantastic.  If you are using 2014....I'm not sure it's worth an upgrade unless you need something that was fixed in 2015.\n\nI now recommend the product.  I don't have any issues with it.  Simply put.....it's doing exactly what I need it to do.\n\nWhat follows is my original review from 4 Oct:\n\nSo far....1 star.\n\nDoes it work?  Yes...mostly.  If you run into errors....good luck.  Support is via a community forum or online chat.  The support community is mostly users, but intuit employees do answer questions.\n\nThe chat support.....eh, the advice I got was not only nonsensical, I knew it wasn't going to work as soon as they posted the ""solution"".  I was really one of those moments where you want to say ""Really?  Did you REALLY just say that?"".\n\nThe credit report function, while cool, is apparently plagued by problems.  It actually worked great until I created a new data file.....hasn't worked since.  I noticed that others are havingthe same or other kinds of issues with it.  For me...this ONE feature gave quicken the nod over other competitors products.  So if you are on the boat about buying quicken or XXXXXX...do NOT weigh that feature.  It is broken.  (Oh, the solution to fix it.....restart in windows safe mode and try again...doesn't work, and really WHY would it?  It's a problem on their end, on their server).\n\nIF they actually fix this issue, then I'll come back and update the review.  However, as it stands now....I've marked the date that I have to return it by to get a refund because after dealing with their support, I was less impressed.  Actually I was pissed that they wasted my time when it's clear they do not know HOW to fix it (See comments in the community forum).\n\nDon't make the mistake I did.  AVOID this product for now.";Not Bad
76;1.0;3.0;657.0;356;I truly believe that what they do is grab one marginal new feature such as free credit score and package it with the latest set of bug fixes and call it a paid upgrade. It's truly shameful, especially to users like myself that continue to buy it year after year. Most of the time when I review products I think the 1-star reviews are outlier bad experiences, but with Quicken, this is my third year in a row of a terrible experience.\n\nHere's the way it went:\n\nDay one:\nBack up everything, twice, just to be sure. Make sure Qucken 2014 installer is still around. Even though they say you won't lose your data, there is so much else that could go wrong.\nDownload the update, count to 10, then install it.\nHey, it installed seamlessly and quickly!\nIt seems to start up faster!\nEverything seems to work. Shortcuts may have even been fixed.\nHey, I can now enter a number in my pay check (split), get the error that stuff doesn't add up, and it will actually bring up the right transaction! It used to bring up the next one in the list. Seriously, developers?\nAccounts seem to update. Well, ok!\n\nDay two:\nOh, no, the password vault no longer works!\nTry again, reset the password, try again, research. Oh, no others, are seeing this!\nLog in to a different account. After the second try of this, I'm in again. But now, every time I'm asked for the vault password, I worry it's not going to work again.\nKeyboard shortcuts aren't fixed! I still have to click on the frickin' title bar first. Come on!\nThe budget is still slow, clunky and has a mind of its own. It likes to auto-scroll all the way to the left even though you've selected a cell and started using the keyboard to scroll. I never understood the concept of the separation of mouse and keyboard cursors.\nThe credit score feature seems to work, but there is no way it could be correct. It is just a cheap, inaccurate ballpark estimate.\n\nDon't even attempt to update an account on its own without using one step update. Chances are that Quicken will start the update and hang forever. You will be forced to use task manager to kill the application and pray that it restarts ok.\n\nSo, no real new features, stuff broken so I'm waiting for the endless software updates to once again get it back to usability, and yes, I once again have to enter a bad review, warning others that while Intuit knows that Quicken is pretty much the only option for its long time users, that any potential new customers should be warned that it probably isn't worth it.\n\nThere is no point in trying the mobile version as two years of 15 minute data syncs, missing accounts have led me to just use Mint as a way to view all accounts online or via mobile.\n\nBy the way, I'm a senior software engineer with about 40 years of experience across many platforms. I had to use quite a bit of that experience to figure out how to work around the various issues that exist in this release.\n\n---\n\nJanuary 27, 2015:\n\nAfter about 4 months and 4 software patches, I think Quicken 2015 is a lot more stable. I would say that it still has many quirks and the biggest lesson I've learned is to wait a few months before upgrading in future releases. Many of the quirks are still there and its stability seems to match Quicken 2014.;Not worthy of a paid upgrade, but finally stable after several months
77;66.0;2.0;8.0;358;I haven't used Quicken in over 5 years and already wish I hadn't purchased a copy.  For absolutely no logical reason Intuit have eliminated the ability to import checking information from csv or xls.  Apparently there is a long complicated work around that can be done (with third party programs). It's just asinine that I have to jump through such hoops to import the last 5 years of transactions.  I bought Quicken with the assumption that it would actually save me time versus manually maintaining in Excel, which couldn't be further from the truth thus far.  I expect this to be just the first of many shortcomings I will discover with this software.;I should have heeded the warnings
78;7.0;1.0;88.0;358;"I purchased this product on the 9/22/2014 release date and tried the new features for 1 week.  I soon realized that I had no interest in this latest version.  I decided to take advantage of Intuit's 60-day refund policy and uninstalled the software.  On 9/29/2014, I emailed my refund request, including Amazon receipt, and confirmation request to Intuit eReturns at ereturns@intuit.com.  Three days have passed and I have received nothing from Intuit to confirm that they received my request.  I am beginning to wonder if I will ever get my refund.  1 star for now, and I will update if I hear back from Intuit.\n\n======\n\nThis is my Status Update on 10/12/2014. Since my last post 10 days ago, I re-emailed my refund request 3 times asking for email confirmation and I received nothing. I then forwarded everything to Customer Support as suggested by ""CL"" Quicken Support who commented on my review. I finally received a letter in the mail asking for my receipt that I already sent as an email attachment 5 times. I'm told now that I must FAX or snail-mail my receipt. Intuit has to be the worst company in America. Their strategy is easy to see --- hope I give up, or delay the process beyond the expiration date. If I do not receive my refund, I will dispute the Amazon Visa charge and file complaints with the BBB and FTC. Shame on you Intuit.";Hmmm, Intuit does not confirm refund requests...
79;90.0;2.0;5.0;361;I can't get the Credit Score feature to work - i continue to receive the follow error message -\n\nInvalid Authorization\n\nInvalid Authorization Error\n\nWe encountered a problem while registering you to Quicken. Please sign out and sign in with your Intuit ID to fix the issue and get your credit report.;Credit Score Error Message
80;46.0;1.0;12.0;361;I updated from Quicken 2013.  Unfortunately I was never able to successfully register the product because of a glitch with the software where Quicken would not recognize my Intuit ID.  After chatting over an hour with a pleasant Quicken rep, I was still not able to use the product and finally got locked out of it altogether.  I am returning it for a full refund and going back to Quicken 2013 or 2014.  Frustrating...;Frustrating...
81;47.0;1.0;12.0;361;As with other versions of Quicken, this one too will only last for a few years before the software stops letting you download any new bank transactions.  They do this to force you to buy the same product again at full price if you want to keep on using it.  It's all just a profit ploy from one of the shadiest tech companies around (Intuit).  The new versions have very few actual improvements, mostly just fixing bugs that were added in the previous year's version (which is the case again with this one).  They do this because they know people wouldn't keep on paying to re-purchase the same thing over and over if the software didn't have a built-in self destruct mechanism to make it (mostly) useless after a limit time period.;Warning: Limited time use.  If you buy this now, you'll just have to pay for it again in another 2-3 years.
82;56.0;1.0;9.0;361;Quicken, the software itself is just a glorified spreadsheet. The problem is how the company Intuit builds and bundles its services around the software so is useless if you don't keep re-buying it. You can go to any store on the Internet and you will see most reviews are bad and the reasons are Intuits bait and switch marketing tricks.\n\nI purchased the Home & Business edition in 2009, one of the most expensive Quicken editions. Most features never worked in the first place and buying the software was a pain, Intuit charged my card like 5 times and took 3 weeks to ship the disc product. Their support was awful, some guy in India that had no clue what Quicken. Be aware that Quicken only supports its product for 3 years, this means that all your updating and banking features or any services that actually makes the software worth will not work anymore and you can just delete the software or trow the disc away and buy a new one.\n\nWhen I asked on the Intuit chat how to upgrade they had no idea to the point I was just told to buy a new version. That's right ! This people don't even give you an upgrade price, you need to buy the full version again. Also their advertised mobile app is restricted by US phones alone, so if you happen to travel or be abroad it will not work. Again false advertising from Intuit when they advertise mobile features, since the app will not download or even work since it has geo restriction, in 2014, in a global world that is just ridiculous.\n\nIn the end the software is to painful to use and you will need to babysit it to make it work. To be honest just stick to the plain and good Excel, it will work anywhere, on all devices, you can sync with the cloud for free and have amazing Excel templates you can buy that do even more advanced stuff than any Quicken software can ever do. Properly configured Excel templates is all you need and offers more for years and years to come vs Quicken which removes features every single year.\n\nBest of all, you will not be kidnapped by Intuit and their custom proprietary files and incompatibility with other systems/softwares. In the end you want to stick to something that is open and works everywhere. The reason you cannot find similar softwares is exactly because Excel just works better, faster and is more simpler than any financial software.\n\nIf you thing the graphics are nice and the banking sync features think again. Most of them don't work correctly as reported by most Quicken users and the nice graphics can be replicated in Excel, since Quicken allows zero customization it means it will not fit almost anyone, unless you are willing to adjust your spending and budgeting to how Intuit decides is the correct way for most people. Also, you don't want to put or save your online banking with this company, believe me. I don't trust them enough to send data to their cloud since they hire the worse possible staff on planet earth. Even if their servers/systems are safe I don't trust its employees based on the shady practices from the past. Just Google it.\n\nIf you want to waste your money each year buying a new version then go ahead. The support is the worse possible I ever had in my life. Its clear Intuit outsources this to the lowest of the world because most people on the chat or the phone have no clue about the product at all, they keep asking you over and over the same questions like if they where retard or like if they are making time on purpose, they probably charge Intuit by minutes, so it would not wonder me they make you lose time on purpose as they keep constantly telling you messages to hold on, or I will look the answer, or I'm typing my reply right now, and then they repeat themselves over and over again. After a while they just ask you the same thing you answered 30 minutes ago.\n\nThe impression Intuit is making with its support is similar to how a scam company would work. Actually scammers on the phone have better support than Intuit. Just try going to their website, try a couple of questions on its chat or phone if you don't believe me.\n\nYou don't want to trust your financial data to this people! Don't be surprised if in a few years there is a major banking breach and users affected are using Intuit cloud services or Intuit softwares...You are warned, this guys outsource everything, this includes your data.;You should not trust your financial data to Intuit!
83;75.0;1.0;7.0;362;terrible COMPANY TO DEAL WITH ! If there is any other choice, take it.  No customer support!!!!!  PS Sell their stock short, going to take a big hit in the marketplace.;Horrible !!!
84;38.0;4.0;14.0;365;"Chris gave a good review that summarizes the push to add new features and fix as many old bugs as possible. I will add a review of some features that I know have been requested by customers in the past.\n\n1.  For the lack of a known terminology, those of you who want to enter data in your registers ""upside down"",  that is, new entries at the top of the register instead of the bottom; you can now do this and it seems to work as reliably as the original way. I expect the next round of complaints of this method will be people who want Quicken 'upside down' to exactly match their bank statements line by line.  I can not see how this will happen.\n\n2. One Intuit Password.  Many people have requested less password entry while inside Quicken.  This year if you elect OIP you will be prompted for you Intuit Password when you open a file, and that is the last time you are prompted for it.  You must make your Vault Password be your Intuit ID and you must choose to have the data file password protected with your Intuit ID.  Those two done, you will be prompted when you open a file for use and that is it.  I think for safety, Quicken also requires you to enter your Intuit Id to print your Vault.  I guess that is in case you do not close down the program and go do something else, that another person can not print the ID's and Passwords from the Vault.  That could be a disaster.\n\nThose are the main features that were added this year.  As Chris mentioned many other things that were not working well in 2014 are now fixed and working properly.  The two new features are Credit Score which is available in Deluxe version and the X-Ray Portfolio Analyzer, Powered by Morning Star is available in Premium or higher.\n\nI did not test either of those, as I use Deluxe and do not have investments to test in higher versions.  My personal opinion of Credit Score tracking is that it is a scam, to start with, that many people think is important.  I am a Dave Ramsey guy and could care less about credit scores.\n\n2015 is a solid stable version and I know that many bugs from prior years are on the fire to be fixed in the next few months and have been assigned to development teams.";A Few Feature Requests that are available in 2015
85;85.0;3.0;6.0;365;The software works well if you input everything manually. None of the bank downloads work on any of the Quicken or Quickbooks programs. There are so many errors that you spend less time if you do it all manually. I have been experiencing this for years and thought it was only my problem. But when you talk to other people they all have the same experience. Miscategorized transactions and most annoying, it creates temporary accounts that you cannot edit.;Bank downloads never work properly
86;30.0;4.0;16.0;366;So I had Quicken 2013 and wasn't thrilled about having to upgrade.  In fact, I would've been content to keep 2013 but I wanted the mobile app to go with my new smart phone.  1 star removed just because it's silly my 2013 can't connect to the mobile app which forced me to upgrade!\n\nSo what did I notice first after the upgrade?  Nothing!!  The interface looks identical to the 2013 and at first I was concerned I wasted my money.  But after using it there are at least two distinct advantages over 2013 so far:\n\n1) Credit Score is prominently displayed and updated every 6 months.  I wasn't expecting this, quite a nice surprise.  It's easy to find free credit reports but not as easy to find free credit scores.\n\n2) Mobile app allows my wife and I to see our budget from our phones.  It's a bit overdue to have that feature but alas, it's here.  One of the core values we have for keeping a budget is to change our spending behavior.  Our budget is extremely simple, split into 3 categories:  Recurring Bills, Misc, and Groceries.  For us, all we care about is should we slow down the spending for the last 10 days of the month.  Or, do we have excess money at the end of the month so we can blow frivolously on some stupid piece of furniture.  The point is, we use our budget to modify our spending behavior mid-month.  The mobile app is helping us to do that much better because we can use it while we're at a store.\n\nLastly, I have no comment on whether this software is better or worse than other software programs.  I have only ever used Microsoft Money and Quicken.  Both are pretty comparable.  2015 does everything I want it to.;Credit Score very cool, mobile app adequate.
87;2.0;4.0;480.0;367;"Well this isn't going to be a traditional review.  Year after year people complain about software and then when it comes time to decide to buy a product all they want to hear about is the new features, and then they wonder why companies spend their time putting features instead of fixing bugs.  For the first time in years, Quicken 2015 has two ""main"" new features, that are not subject to crashing Quicken, like most of the major ones of the past.  Their approach this year has been more about fixing bugs, and that is what I care about.\n\nAnd in this vane I'm going to mention a few of the ones I find important over Quicken 2014.\n1) Transfers from IRA/401K accounts now work properly, and can be deleted.\n2) Quicken 2015 now works properly with Windows scaling (also known as the DPI setting), with the exception of the Portfolio X-Ray, which doesn't get scaled.  Note the Portfolio X-Ray feature is new to Quicken 2015, and is only available in Premier or above.  Which of course doesn't apply to the Deluxe version.\n3) The Download Transactions tab no longer open even when there are no transactions to import.\n4) Numerous of the ""focus"" problems have been fixed.  In other words using Alt-Tab and then going back to Quicken the focus is in the right place.  This is also the cause/fix for the shortcut keys not working sometimes.\n5) Many small fixes.\n\nAnd it is my hope we will finally get a patch release cycle that isn't all about crashes and data corruption, so that as time goes on they will make Quicken 2015 even more solid.  I believe that at this point in the release cycle Quicken 2015 is the most stable release since Quicken 2010.";I prefer bug fixes over features.
88;42.0;1.0;13.0;367;"This absolutely sucks. I downloaded it and it doesn't work. Add to that Quicken demands to paid for their chat system immediately after I bought this piece of crap. If there was a lower score than above I would give it - terrible product; a ripoff in purchase and a ripoff in support. I am very disappointed with Quicken, I had been a user of Quicken for twenty years. What a crock!";Complete Crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
89;58.0;4.0;9.0;368;I have been using Quicken for twenty years now. I was hesitant to upgrade right away, because of the major upgrade issues of the previous two versions. But, I did it anyway. Thankfully, the only issue that I have is with registering for the free credit score. I receive an error, but I expect that this will be resolved soon. This is a quarterly score from Equifax.\n\nThe major reasons that I use Quicken is for downloading financial transactions, scheduling bills, tracking investments, managing cash flow in the Calendar, and for the Tax Planner. So far, no issues with any of these components. I do not use the mobile apps. My database appears intact, with no issues regarding mislabeled categories or improperly downloaded transactions.\n\nSo far so good!;A solid release!

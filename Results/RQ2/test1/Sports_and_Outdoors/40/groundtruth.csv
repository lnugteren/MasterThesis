10;1.0;2.0;151.0;62 days, 9 uses!  That's all it took for this umbrella's shaft to crack at the spring mechanism and yield it unusable.  To its credit, the umbrella looks good and functioned well, but the craftsmanship I expected from this item was simply not there.  Researching umbrellas and coming upon the great reviews of this umbrella, I had expected a quality product that would last at least a few seasons.  That didn't happen.\n\nWhen I contacted the company for a solution, they offered to fix it if I 1) sent the umbrella back at my expense which, being an odd shape is nearly half the cost of the umbrella itself AND 2) enclose a check for $10 to get it fixed. That does not strike me as stellar customer-centric service.;Lacks Quality and Durability, Combined with Lackluster Customer Service.
3;2.0;1.0;6.0;I purchased my first Gustbuster Classic in 2007.  It lasted me over 9 years.  Two months ago, I purchased 2 new Gustbuster Classic umbrellas.  I've only used one of them a handful of times, but one of the support beams has already broken.  Given how high quality my previous Gustbuster was, I was hopeful that the manufacturer would stand behind their product and either issue me a refund or send me a new umbrella given that I am outside of my Amazon return window.  The only option they would give me is to pay to have it shipped back to them along with a $10 check to pay for return shipping on either a repaired (if they determined it could be repaired) or a new umbrella.  I bought my Gustbusters on special, one for about $11 and one for about $13.  No way was I going to pay $20 for this.  As of the time I'm writing this, a new one is $30.11.  Even at that price, paying $20 just to have it fixed doesn't make much sense to me.  I hope the other Gustbuster I purchased does not also break so easily.  I will try to update my review once I see whether that one lasts.  Fortunately, Amazon made an exception and is allowing me to return the Gustbuster that broke outside of the normal return window for a full refund.;Broke Quickly and Poor Manufacturer Customer Service
26;3.0;1.0;161.0;"For a premium $40 umbrella that is supposed to withstand the forces of nature, I was disappointed by this.\n\nI've had the umbrella for less than a year and the hook to trap the umbrella closed no longer works.  Now, to keep the umbrella closed I need to manually hold it with my hands.  This makes it extremely inconvenient and difficult to use.  Reading through other reviews, it's clear that many other have had this same issue with the hook.  BIG red flag in my book.\n\nWhen I called to address the issue, similar to others, I've had a poor experience with their ""lifetime warranty.""  I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. With a total cost of ~$20 to me, what kind of lifetime guarantee is that? I can easily buy another umbrella for that price.  The policy makes NO sense on manufacturer issues like this.  On top of it, customer service was not very friendly nor accomodating in dealing with this issue.";Breaks easily

Granted you take good care of it and do not leave it on a bus or train.\n\nThe umbrella (automatic version) is easy to open, is light weight, and above all lives up to its ""gust-busting"" claims of very high winds.\n\nAlthough I do wish it was just a wee bit larger, perhaps 52 inches, it is still large enough to shield most of your upper body in moderate downpours with light winds without having to play umbrella chicken with other folks passing by.\n\nIt is a nice one person umbrella...but not for two.\n\nHowever, for a taller man, the lower legs may still catch some of the rain run off. But not too bad.\n\nWhile I found the quality of the fabric just average, the handle, stick, and ribs of the product feel strong and stable; ready to tackle high winds. Each outer spoke attaches the upper canopy using elastic bands. The lower canopy seems to be more rigid and attached to the main frame.\n\nWhen the wind does get under it, both canopies separate allowing the wind to just flow through the large holes, all while keeping you dry. The elastics let the upper canopy stretch upwards which seems to work the magic preventing the umbrella to invert.\n\nThe reason I am writing this review is because it passed its real test just yesterday when here on Staten Island, New York, we had heavy rain with wind gusts of up to 50 MPH. (the GustBuster claims it handles 55+ winds).\n\nI figured this was a good opportunity to give it a try.\n\nIn between the Supreme Court building and 130 Stuyvesant Pl is like a wind tunnel on days like this. There are always destroyed umbrellas in the garbage bins on either side of the street.\n\nMy Gustbuster did its job impressively while everyone else around me had their umbrellas blown inside out.\n\nBefore the Gustbuster, I had a Hammacher Schlemmer ""wind defying"" umbrella which was sort of ok in light to medium winds (25 MPH or so), but did blow inside out on me twice, the second tearing part of the fabric off the ribs.\n\nSo, for folks who want a true wind resistant umbrella. Go with the Gustbuster. And also keep in mind that the classic stick style has the best overall quality build.\n\nJust don't lean the umbrella into the wind (as if shielding yourself) since this does put pressure on the ribs, and try and keep it half-open to relief pressure and extend the life.\n\nDon't walk into an EF 1 or higher tornado with it either, ha ha!\n\nAlso, the Metro 43 Inch version that I bought as a spare seems a bit flimsy and not as strong as the classic stick version...the parts on the metro feel somewhat cheaper. Didn't give that one the test yet though...\n\nI'm not sure about the larger 62 inch umbrellas.\n\nHope my review was helpful for those considering this product.\n\n=======\nUPDATE! SEE SHORT VIDEO TEST Above (""METRO"" MODEL)\n=======\n\nJust yesterday (3/13/10) we had extremely strong winds here on Staten Island, New York with reported gusts over 65 MPH.\n\nI figured that this was yet another great opportunity to give my 2 Gustbusters another wind test.\n\nMy Classic 48 Inch umbrella performed the same as usual...but it was the smaller 43 Inch Metro that I wanted to test.\n\nAlthough having somewhat of a lesser construction quality, it held up pretty good. The winds on Fox 5 news were reported around 30 to 35 MPH sustained with gusts of up to 60+ MPH.\n\nThe Metro did a very good job at holding together for the most part, but...a very strong gust, probably 55 to 60 MPH I'm guessing, did manage to cause it to finally invert, (not shown in video).\n\nHowever, no major damage occurred and I just faced it back in to the wind to correct it again.\n\nSo, these umbrellas WILL invert, but only in gusts that are extremely high! I live right near the coastline so our winds were some of the stronger gusts. In these cases don't even bother using an umbrella since you're going to be wind-soaked anyway.\n\nOverall, I still rate the Classic stick style at 5 stars (the Metro at 3 1/2 stars due to lesser quality) and trust me that they do perform as advertised. But do expect them to blow inside out in those rare 55+ gusts as it did in my test run.\n\nAfter all they are labeled and wind tunnel tested at 55+ MPH, so that is pretty accurate and honest advertising.\n\nHope this update was helpful!";"My GustBuster ""Classic"" Umbrella Review (VIDEO of ""Metro"")"

37;6.0;5.0;130.0;"I fold, as in, ""I give up.""  I've owned my share of ""wind-resistant"" folding umbrellas and none of them lived up to the claim.  Even GustBuster makes a folding umbrella but I was drawn to this one's classic beauty.\n\nIt's not so bulky that you can't take it everywhere and the canopy is the perfect size for him or her, or in a pinch, him AND her.  The real wood crook-shaped handle gives it a touch of class.  The opening mechanism relies on the proven coil-spring system, but that's where the similarity to other solid-shaft automatics ends.\n\nFiberglas takes the place of metal in the parts that might attract lightning, making the GustBuster light for its size but just as sturdy.  Unzip the two Velcro straps, push the button and two canopies pop open to shield you from the rain.  The raindrop-shaped openings allow the wind to pass between the canopies.  Then aerodynamics take over, forcing the canopies to retain their shape instead of turning inside out.  Elastic straps hold down the upper canopy, eliminating a gap where the rain might sneak in.  A video of GustBuster's wind-cannon testing confirms their claims.  You can see it at GustBuster's website (just tack on the "".com""). Combine this high level of engineering and thoughtful design with GustBuster's affordable pricing on all their umbrellas and it adds up to possibly the best umbrella value.";Classic beauty goes high-tech
21;7.0;1.0;104.0;"This umbrella is really nice.\n\nThe problem with it is it breaks SUPER easily.  I babied mine because I read all the reviews on here before I bought it.  The weakness is where the spindles attach themselves.  It's a point that needs to support alot of stress and the cheap fiberglass spindles cannot do so.\n\nIf you buy this you'll probably be sorry for doing so sooner or later.  I rarely review anything on amazon but thought I would on this so others wouldn't have throw money away.\n\nAlso ""lifetime guarantee"" is complete hogwash.  Guarantee as in customer pays shipping + a $10 surcharge equaling $20.  I'm not willing to throw another andrew jackson to the wind (no pun intended)";Same as everyone else

The trash barrel near my office always has at least one umbrella in it, and my sturdy Totes 34"" umbrella was blown inside out by the wind here.\n\nI am pleased to say the GustBuster has worked perfectly and I am very pleased with my purchase.  I would say I would buy another one, but I don't foresee this umbrella ever failing.  This is an excellent umbrella.";Lives up to its name
13;9.0;3.0;42.0;"I bought this umbrella over a year ago from Amazon. I live in Chicago and needed an umbrella that won't break in the strong winds we get in this city, and this umbrella has done well as far as that's concerned. The canopy is strong and provides plenty of cover for one person, decent amount of cover for two. It holds up well in stiff winds.\n\nHowever, the handle has started cracking on the surface. The handle is advertised as ""hardwood"", but it looks like it is made of a wooden core with some kind of cheap plaster layer on the outside, stained and lacquered to look like wood. On my umbrella the handle has started chipping and coming off in powdery chunks, and it looks like it's only going to get worse. I've put up a picture in the product photos. I really want to like this umbrella but this poor worksmanship in the handle is awful.";Windproof as advertised but shoddy worksmanship in other parts
36;10.0;1.0;62.0;I was excited to have this umbrella on a very rainy, windy day in San Francisco. A strong gust of wind came along and snapped not one but *every* support on the canopy, rendering the umbrella completely useless...and me completely soaked.;Broke completely, almost immediately
6;11.0;2.0;18.0;I've yet to try this umbrella in the rain, but I do have a few comments on it already.  It does feel nice and sturdy, good weight in hand.  There is one glaring issue.  This umbrella is NOT 48-inches in diameter.  If geometry class served me correctly (it has been a while), the diameter is the measurement from one point on on a circle to the direct opposite side of the circle.  I noticed that this umbrella is MUCH smaller than my previous golf umbrella that, when measured was about 58 inches across.  This 48 inches is measured if you were to completely flatten out the umbrella.  Otherwise, from side to side, while open, this umbrella is ~39 inches across.  It's OK sized, but as a person who walks around the rainy NW with a backpack, I need something just a HAIR bigger.;48 inches in diameter...not quite

35;14.0;2.0;39.0;Purchased one last winter.  The design worked very well in high wind conditions.  That was until one day I opened it and the thing virtually exploded on me!  All the stays are held in place at the top with a flimsy twisted bit of wire.  When manufactured there was probably one twist too many.  All the tension provided by the spring action proved to be too much and blam!  Ended up with a useless tangle of nylon material and bent aluminum.  As I mentioned, the umbrella worked extremely well for the few weeks before it died, I'm just reluctant to purchase a replacement unless assured that the quality of construction has improved.;cheap construction
9;15.0;1.0;14.0;"I ordered this umbrella a few months ago on back-order and was excited for it to arrive--I watched the videos and thought this product would be great for my commute. To my dismay when the umbrella arrived, I opened the triangular package (no padding or other protective measures, which others may have commented on already) and opened up the umbrella to find the beginnings of a crack on the fiberglass shaft.\n\nTo be fair, I asked for a re-shipment and received the next in two day's time. However, the second was no better--actually, the next umbrella was exactly the same, with the same chip in the fiberglass. Perhaps every umbrella is like this, but for me at least, this is unacceptable given the price I'm paying. Needless to say I've returned them both.\n\nMy main worry was that the umbrella's shaft would eventually crack fully with use, which is what I saw later in a two-star review by ""The Allen"" on Mar 24, 2015. Based on my testing, the plastic piece that locks into place upon closing the umbrella slides right over this chip, which has a small metal piece protruding from the shaft. After only a few test opens/closes, I could hear the fiberglass very slowly chipping away, which, like I said before, was unacceptable for me.\n\nPerhaps it was a bad batch, but given my experience (and what I've heard from others in the same boat) I wouldn't buy from this company again. I don't normally write reviews at all, but this experience was so bad that I wanted to warn others.";Disappointed, fiberglass shaft beginning to crack, unacceptable
38;16.0;3.0;36.0;Arrived well-packed and promptly.  Appeared initially to be an attractive, sturdy product.  However, the release button soon fell off.  Then the closer clasp went into terminal failure, meaning it tends to pop back open unless it is closed really carefully with both hands.  Frankly, these are attributes I would expect of cheap box store merchandise.  In constrast, I found a few old (30-40 years) umbrellas, when I was emptying my in-law's home that were apparently received as gifts and left there for me to pillage.  They have not failed to function.  Unless you have the personal allowance of my congressman, I would suggest you search auctions and even antique shops for similar older quality made in American products which can still provide you years of service.;A disappointing product
17;17.0;1.0;23.0;The umbrella seems to stand up to the wind quite well once it is open. Closing it again is where you begin to run into problems. The latch mechanism on mine wasn't actually attached to anything, causing it to fall out frequently and making stowing the umbrella quite difficult. I spoke to the manufacturer, who agreed that the product was defective, and agreed to replace it provided I paid ~$20 ($10 of which was a processing fee). It seems like poor business practice to ask a customer to pay ~50% of the original item's cost to replace defective merchandise.;Nice Umbrella, Lousy Company

18;20.0;2.0;19.0;I received this umbrella as a gift, so I'm not sure exactly what vendor it was purchased from. When it's open and in use, it's excellent. It really does hold up to strong wind, and I also like the feel of the contoured wood handle (much nicer than holding a cold, damp piece of plastic or metal in a storm).\n\nThe sad problem with this umbrella is the latch on the shaft that's supposed to keep it closed. It is VERY weak, and the umbrella often pops open unexpectedly. This has caused some scary close calls for me when carrying the closed umbrella, with the umbrella almost hitting children and pets in the face, and popping open in stores and restaurants.\n\nThe worst part of this problem is that I wrote to the Gustbuster company in detail about this problem. (The umbrella came with a warranty card.) It's been over six months, and I have not heard a peep back from them. It's a shame that a product that is almost great has such an annoying flaw. It's even worse that the company doesn't seem to give a damn about it.;Good design, shoddy construction, horrible customer service

I called the company about this and spoke to a man who identified himself as the company president (1-888-(487-8287)) - he was rude, interrupted me constantly, and wouldn't let me even finish a sentence. First he said that that was the standard definition and then he told me that he didn't believe me when I quoted his own website. He did say he would get the website description changed, but that doesn't make selling me an umbrella smaller than described OK\n\nat this point, I'm not going to buy another GB umbrella just because I don't want to give money to a company who thinks it's OK to treat a customer the way I was treated on the phone";"strange definition of ""diameter"""

5;23.0;4.0;6.0;"I bought a black Gustbuster umbrella in 2007. I still have that same umbrella now in 2016. That's nine years. Imagine going nine years without losing an umbrella!\n\n QUALITY \nWhile this umbrella has endured these past nine years, there are a couple of things from my experience that you should know about it. One, when you pop the umbrella opens there is a mechanism near the top that keeps it open. This mechanism works most of the time, but sometimes it doesn't lock into place and your umbrella top goes bouncing up and down until it randomly locks into place. I hope they have fixed this in the nine years since I bought it. Second, the button that unlocks the umbrella, on the shaft right above the curved handle, wore down over time and broke off, affecting the structural stability of the fiberglass shaft slightly [see photos]. This means that the umbrella will open automatically when you un-Velcro it, and when you close it it takes a little effort to hold it in place while you put the two Velcro straps back on. Minus a star for these two issues, but these two things don't affect the functionality of the umbrella, much.\n\nBesides those two mentioned points, the umbrella works fine, and its condition still looks like the day I got it. The fabric looks the same, no seams have come undone, it looks great. The wooden handle looks weathered but is still as strong as ever. The umbrella tip end has worn down over the years from being dragged on the ground, but that has no effect on its use.\n\n WIND RESISTANCE \nGustbuster's wind resistance was the primary reason I bought one. I saw their video testing this umbrella to 55+ mph winds and that impressed me. Their tear drop shaped vents and two layered top construction keeps wind resistance to a minimum. Wind blows and flows right through the holes. During a few extra windy days this umbrella did invert, and didn't break apart. It reverted back to its normal shape like nothing ever happened. Like a boss.\n\n FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS \nAs an Industrial Designer, here's my two cents as to how to improve future models: One, fix the mechanism that keeps the top in place so it works at all times. Two, use better materials for the button and shaft that opens the umbrella up, or maybe use different mechanics. Three, maybe use a waterproof material for the fabric (website says it's waterproof, but maybe they added that later since the time I bought it); that way it will add another selling point: being wind and water resistant.\n\n HOW NOT TO LOSE AN UMBRELLA \nHonestly, I don't know how I managed not to lose this umbrella this entire time. However, one of my tricks whenever I take this umbrella out was constantly thinking to myself, ""this is an expensive umbrella, don't lose it!"", or, ""you're carrying $40 around, don't lose it!"" And thus, that's how I prevent myself from forgetting about it. There were a few close calls of me nearly forgetting it somewhere, but this is still with me.\n\n WARRANTY \nGustbuster offers a ""Limited Lifetime Warranty"". If something happens to your umbrella, you mail it back with a $10 check, and they will send you a new or repaired one. Considering it probably cost $10 to ship it back, the total will likely cost you $20. A new umbrella cost $40. Whether that's worth it is up to you.\n\nThis is a quality umbrellawith the exception of the top portion that locks it in place when you close it, and the button on the shaft to open it. I will continue to use it, and should it eventually fall apart and be irreparable, then I'll probably end up buying another Gustbuster to replace it. Recommended.\n\n*** NOTE ***\nI noticed that this umbrella now has a lot of color options. Check Gustbuster's website for the official colors available for each model.

Last week it rained hard, and my small Totes umbrella left me soaked from my knees to my shoes. I ordered my GustBuster that very day from Amazon. I selected the 48-inch Golf umbrella - which is clearly described in the advert blurb as 48 inches in **diameter**. I considered purchasing the larger umbrella, but negotiating crowded city side-walks with a 60-inch umbrella seemed too dangerous. The umbrella arrived promptly and it appears sturdy in construction and attractive in appearance. However, it seemed much smaller than the advertised 48 inches in diameter and smaller than my needs. I measured the diameter and found it was 40 inches, not 48 inches. It appears that the 48 inches refers to a measurement over the dome, which is not a useful metric and is very misleading. Now I wish I purchased the 60-inch umbrella.\n\nUpdate on 10/1/2010: I just walked to my office through the first really hard rain and wind storm since I purchased the Gustbuster. It did not invert even though the gusts were reportedly hitting 40 mph. As I feared, however, the umbrella dumped the runoff directly onto my legs and shoes due to the insufficient 40 inch diameter. I am soaked from my knees to my socks. Good enough for a shower, perhaps, but not for a downpour.\n\nUpdate on 8/25/2015: In the intervening years, I had my original GustBuster taken from a communal umbrella stand, so I purchased another. I am sorry to say that this one completely inverted in a windy rain storm. The fabric was torn off two of the supports.

14;30.0;3.0;9.0;"I specifically bought this umbrella based on its description of being 48 inches ""in diameter."" Umbrella companies seem to make their products appear larger by stating the ""arc"" size, which is larger than the ""diameter."" However, Amazon specifically states the diameter is 48 inches. The actual diameter of this umbrella is 38 inches at its narrowest point (it's a polygon) to 42 inches at its widest point. The point of using the arc measurement is stupid because, in theory, you could have one of those 1970s bubble umbrellas that has an arc of 100 inches, but a diameter of 30. However, the umbrella is still good for its size. I just wanted a larger umbrella.";Stated diameter is incorrect
20;31.0;1.0;10.0;Great, great umbrella for living in New York CIty. Winds no longer brake umbrela. Something else brakes: velcro ties fell of after couple of uses. Handle very easy to scratch.\nWorst thing, manufacturer wants $10 to get it repaired. Their own defect and they want more money to get it repaired.\n\nDo not buy this low quality product!;Great for wind, but bad quality
28;32.0;1.0;11.0;I bought this overpriced umbrella because it was advertised to beat the winds and it didn't exactly do that. I was in NYC and it gets very windy there..and this umbrella broke from the hinges which push and keep the umbrella open. I have seen other reviews describing a similar problem..the hinges don't appear to be well made with a decent quality material and explains why it broke...what a waste of 35 dollars...\nI would not advise others to buy this. Why not buy a $10 umbrella so you won't have to regret it when it breaks..;Overpriced, broke from hinges in NYC winds
34;33.0;4.0;11.0;Positives: Four months of use in the wind and rain and this umbrella has worked perfectly. Easy to open and close. Sturdy design - it's held up in 40+ mph wind gusts.  Good classic look (my umbrella does not have the large logo that some others apparently to contain).\n\nNegatives: The umbrella's wood handle is satisfactory. From an aesthetics standpoint, a higher grade of wood would really improve this umbrella's looks and would result in a five star rating from me.\n\nSummary: This is a good looking and very functional umbrella. On a personal note, I'm a big guy and this size umbrella works well for me. However, it's a little small for me and a second person. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.;Good Value for the Money
32;34.0;4.0;10.0;"This is a simple umbrella with a classic look. It has a quality build that's likely to last a long time. However, it's also a little bulky, with a wooden, non-collapsible handle, and it's difficult to stand it, even in a corner. I would prefer an umbrella that retained the classic look while being more compact and easy to put down when there's no umbrella stand in sight.\n\nYou might wonder how big an umbrella you need. 48"" is probably a little more than you need as an individual, and a little too small to cover two people.";Classy umbrella
24;35.0;1.0;9.0;I bought one and hey, it broke. One of the ribs busted. So, I emailed and they told me that in addition to shipping, there was a $10 fee.\n\nThat's some guarantee...;Don't Waste Your Money
27;36.0;2.0;9.0;Last year I ordered this umbrella from Amazon - I like the size and like the fact it shouldn't turn inside out in the wind. However the automatic feature didn't work and when I closed the umbrella it wouldn't latch closed (then would spring back open). They come with a lifetime warranty so I contacted the company and they sent me a Return Authorization number. I spent $20 to FedEx it to them for repair or replacement then heard nothing for a month. To follow up I called them and they (a) had no idea where it was(they showed it came in but had no idea after that) and (b) couldn't send me a new black one for THREE MORE MONTHS! What the heck? What a way to run a business! I'd use my other pricey collapsible gust buster but it is manual and too much to deal with in Manhattan rain, getting in and out of cabs, etc. For the price I paid I'd have been better off buying (then replacing as needed) Totes automatic collapsing umbrellas. The Gustbuster automatics are good in theory, but pricey and paired with lousy execution and worse customer service.\n\nBTW three months came and went and still no replacement (during the rainiest season), requiring two more calls.  In order to get something - anything -  I had to settle for a green automatic umbrella which I don't like.\n\nAlso, and this is a personal preference matter, I don't love the curved handle . . .;decent umbrella, not great features, poor customer service
15;37.0;2.0;7.0;Looks very classy, and feels nice and sturdy. I've only used it once, but I live in Chicago and everyone I passed on the street had bent-arm umbrellas. It doesn't even feel like the arms would bend like that on the GustBuster. Great construction.\n\nAlso, the automatic open is great. A little lever makes it pop open and I feel like a classic man.\n\nMy only two drawbacks are that the curve of the handle tip is a little tight to go over my fore arm smoothly, and that it's not the easiest to close the Velcro closure when temporarily closing the umbrella, like when going in and out of stores. I would like a smarter solution here to match the quality of the rest of the umbrella. I also feel like the Velcro will breakdown quickly, which I'll probably have to even replace before the umbrella.\n\nOne concern I did have from the reviews was the mention of big, colorful, gaudy logo. When I received it, I was happy to see that it was minimal and not an issue.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter using this for maybe 10-15 times, the velcro attachments for the sinching wraps are already tearing off. Disappointed in that. Not sure if it can be resewn, but it should have lasted longer than this in all aspects. Everything else is still great.;Velcro tearing off after 15 uses...
31;38.0;1.0;8.0;To make a long story short, the FIRST time I used this umbrella, the stem & one of the spindles holding up the umbrella cracked and broke in a 30 mph wind gust in driving rain.  I was not pleased.;Gust Busted
22;39.0;4.0;7.0;Most of the product's description is correct: it is well-designed and holds up to strong winds.  I was a big fan of mine---until it broke.  I then learned that the warranty is not really effective, which is something you may want to consider.  After mine broke (one of the threads that holds the canape to the spokes failed) I called to have it repaired.  They were happy to honor the warranty, but they demand that you pay for the shipping *in both directions*.  After you find an umbrella-shaped box, mail it to them, and pay them the 10 dollars they require for shipping and handling to get it back to you, you might as well have just bought a new one (not sure if this is still the case, but last I looked they were under 30 dollars).\nFor now, I've just fixed mine with bit of copper wire.  It seems to be holding up so far...;Good umbrella, but the warranty is a lie...
19;40.0;3.0;5.0;"I live in a very rainy city (Pittsburgh) so I get a lot of mileage out of this umbrella. As a graduate student, I wear a backpack and walk about 1.5 miles to and from campus every day, and so one of the major advantages of this umbrella is that I can hang it on my backpack via its crooked handle. For easy access, I hang it through the bottom of the right-hand shoulder strap, so it almost looks like it's sheathed like a sword at my side.\n\nThe umbrella itself works very well against the rain; however, when I click the umbrella shut, it doesn't stay shut. The ""catch"" is very unstable. I have to grip it tightly shut to keep it closed while I wind the velcro straps around it, since they're the only things that work to keep it shut. It's a very sad flaw, because I'm otherwise very happy with this umbrella.";"The ""catch"" mechanism doesn't work well"

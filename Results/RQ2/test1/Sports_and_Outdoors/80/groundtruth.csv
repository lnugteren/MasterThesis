45;1.0;5.0;372.0;"I was hesitate about buying this in the beginning, because some people said it's nice but another half people said it'll broken within months. But buying a super heavy workout machine to put it in living room really doesn't sound a good idea to me, I want a lite weight machine that I can move it around when I need to do so. So I decide to give it a try.\nAfter several months passed, I can say this is a very good quality elliptical machine. And I can understand why some people said it's easy to be broken. Every once a while you have to ""maintain"" this machine by checking if there is any screw loose and you need to tight it up. If you don't do that and let it keeping loose, eventually you'll start to leason some noise and then it's likely to broken.\nAs long as you spend 2 mins each quarter keep it in a good shape, I can see this machine can last for a very very long time.";A good quality of machine
0;2.0;5.0;457.0;Just got the unit. I bought it because it had a design similar to an Orbitrek Elite. Unfortunately both of my Orbitrek's broke after 1 year. The pedal crank on both units started to slip badly making both unusable. Clearly a design flaw.\n\nThis unit was 1/3 the price of an Orbitrek Elite but is better in many ways.\n\n#1 You can actually read the LCD display on this unit while you are using it. On the Orbitrek it was at a bad angle and you had to get off the unit to read it.\n\n#2 Better stability if your floor is not perfectly level. The unit has two leveler screws on the base which are easily adjusted so it will not rock from side to side.\n\n#3 You can adjust the tension better. With 1 turn of the tension control, the Orbitrek Elite went from easy to very hard. On this unit as you turn it, it gradually gets harder. You can go from easy to hard in 5 or 6 turns.\n\n#4 Pedal crank design is different than Orbitrek and hopefully will stay functional with a lot if usage.\n\nLike the Orbitrek it takes up very little space and is easy to move, otherwise, everything else is the same.\n\nPersonally I find elliptical machines that use a bicycle shaft more natural to use. The motion feels very natural like riding a bike. And once you turn up the tension you will start to burn those calories!\n\nThe only downside is this machine does not come with a workout DVD. Guess I will just use my Orbitrek DVD instead.\n\nOh yeah it takes about 30 minutes to put the unit together. The manual could have been a little better, it might take you an hour if you are not good at assembling things.\n\nAnd you may have to adjust the tenion strap just once so that it really does get hard when you turn it to the max. It's easy, just set it to minimal tension, unlock the buckle that holds it, pull it real tight (use a plyers if you must) and close the buckle. It's in the manual, so don't worry, and it's easy to do.\n\nThat's it. Now I'm about to buy a second one for my wife.;First Impressions Exerpeutic Aero vs Orbitrek Elite
77;3.0;1.0;323.0;I was initially very impressed with this machine, its cheap, easy to put together, and for the 40 miles i put on it, it worked well. About a week and a half into it it started sounding like it was going to explode! It started screaching very loudly and making thunking noises, and was getting harder and harder to pedal, while at the same time black shavings were scraping off of something onto our floor. I opened it up and straightened wheel out which was horribly misalligned, but it didn't make any difference, it was toast. Called exepeutic since it was still on warranty, and its the most unprofessional company ever, they told me to take it apart again(even though I told them I did that the previous evening ,but they made me tear it down again), then put me on hold with some horrible morning show blasting ,fellow on the phone was not friendly and not helpful, then after putting me on hold he told me to ship it back to amazon. I told him i got rid of the box and he acted like i was a moron...I live in an apartment with a baby ,wife and myself, i don't have room for excess packaging. but anyway, moral of the story ,the machine started out great, for as shortly as it lasted, then the warranty from this company means nothing, they just pawn you off on amazon. Buy at your own risk, it may not be worth the hassle, stress, and time of dealing with the horrible company and waiting for machines, repacking, resending ,etc ,etc;Less than 40 miles on it and its toast!
3;4.0;1.0;6.0;"Terrible item and experience with Amazon Chat support. The item took about 3 hours to assemble and once done it was completely lopsided and made so much noise- like a freight train in my living room banging from side to side and thumping where the ""air wheel"" is.\nWhile one side may touch the ground the other is sticking about 2"" off the floor- a complete disaster. It comes with ""adjustment screws"" to keep it level but they aren't long enough to even make a slight improvement.\nI contacted Amazon support via chat and was transferred around to India and back for over an hour. They provided absolutely no help or solution other than sending a replacement as long as I disassemble and repackaged it in it's original box- Sure I will spend another 3 hours getting grease all over me trying to disassemble this piece of junk. I would rather roll it out to the curb and watch the bulk pick up truck smash this to pieces for a $90 entertainment fee then have to deal with trying to take this apart- look at the assembly instructions and you will clearly see why I have no desire to even attempt that.\nYou win or lose some when ordering online, this is definitely a loss but more importantly I am disgusted with the way that Amazon Chat Support handled the situation not offering solutions like sending a courier or providing me a large enough box to place this massive piece of crap in.\n\nIf you really feel the need to purchase it get it from Walmart at the same price so you can roll it right back after your finished putting it together.";Wobbly, Cheap, and Loud
69;5.0;5.0;233.0;I bought this because I'm a college student and a single mom, so getting to the gym is a joke when you have a 6 month old. I love it! I get the same results as I do from the one I used at the gym. It has an incline, but it makes it so I do get the same results. I used loctite like one of the other reviews suggest and it works awesome! Nothing has come apart! My only problem is I don't have the stamina I did before I was pregnant, so this thing kicks my butt on a regular basis. If you don't want to spend a lot and need to stay at home more, I would definitely get this one! I live 15 minutes from the closest gym and it's cheaper to have this than go to the gym and pay for an hour of daycare every day plus gas! I'm also 230lbs and it holds up well with my weight so it's very study. I used loctite on anything that needed to stay in place and I have had no problems at all!;Love it
48;6.0;2.0;150.0;The stride length is short, and it feels like I am running downhill on it, so it pinches my toes a bit. I had to tighten a few bolts on it as they came loose after the first month. One of the washers broke apart. I stopped going backwards on it because I am afraid it will fall apart. I am using it on carpet, it is a little noisy. The calorie counter is not accurate. Other than that it has been great, it saves space in the house, and it is fun to work out on for me as opposed to a treadmill, and I am getting in better shape with it. I hope it will last at least a year. I will update at the year mark......\nUpdate. I bought it in November so it has been about 7 months. It broke last month but I've been too lazy to update the review. The belt became loose about 6 months, the shielding material for the belt was partially off. I tightened the belt and sinched it down as per the instructions. However, the belt came loose again within an hour. Without the belt working, there is no resistance and the machine is practically useless. July 26th 2015 checked on belt and it is completely worn out. Posted picture. Don't buy this product. Not even one year.\nUpdate* contacted the manufacturer and they have sent a belt replacement and are very responsive online. It doesn't seem easy to replace the belt as you have to access inside the plastic. I have to figure how to either have tiny hands or take it apart. I gave one more star for the manufacturer being eager to send a replacement and contact thru email.;Short stride, downward angle, poor quality.
1;7.0;3.0;212.0;Was shipped and arrived quickly. Not really to hard to put together if you have common sense. One hand rail is a little shorter than the other & I feel like the foot pedals are a little to inclined, but you get what you pay for - it does do the trick as far as what an elliptical is suppose to do though, so if you want one for a cheap price then this is the one to get. The product could be better but the result for my work out is just what I wanted.;It's okay.
4;8.0;5.0;14.0;I have used this once so far since it arrived today and it worked well. I used it for an hour and felt like I had a really good workout when I got done. The machine isn't overly loud, I didn't need to blast my TV to still hear it. I don't think it's any louder than someone running on a treadmill, but it does have some sound. The faster you go, the louder it is, but it still isn't super loud. For a machine under $100, I am impressed with it. It's fairly easy to move around if you need to move it to somewhere else and does not take up a lot of space. It took my Dad about 30-45 minutes to assemble it and there were no issues. You definitely need to wear tennis shoes on it or your feet will slide around on the pedals. The pedals are at a little bit of an incline when they are up, but if you have shoes on you shouldn't slide around. I saw some reviews mentioning being too tall or too short, I am 5'1 and did not have any issues using this machine. If I run into any issues with the machine I will update my review, but overall I am really pleased with this machine for the price.;I used it for an hour and felt like I had a really good workout when I got ...
51;9.0;5.0;68.0;For under a $100, this really can't be beat.  If you're looking to get a gym quality elliptical, this isn't for you, but if you're looking to get a no frills, space saving, best bang for your buck elliptical, look no further.  I've had family and friends come by and try it out, and they all ended up buying one for themselves.  Hope this helps!;Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
39;10.0;1.0;50.0;Just now putting this together after purchasing it a few months ago. Sorry I waited so long considering this bolt came stripped and now I'm not able to return and I can't use this machine.;came damaged
18;11.0;5.0;41.0;Takes a half hour to put it together. If you want a incline you can adjust it on the bottom. It is easy to\nassemble if you can read.\nAll parts are there and some are hidden in the sterofoam so look closely to find them. Some parts have\na left and right. It is incredible and I recommend it if you want to work out. I was tired of sitting on my\nexercise bike so I upgraded. It is around 60 pounds and mine is black. It is heavy duty and made well. It\ncome with batteries too. I use my pedals just like riding a bike. Never go backwards or you will ruin it.\nAfter a few months you need to oil the nuts and bolts. It has a easy dial tension. It has a LCD display that\nindicates distance, calories burned, elapsed time, and speed. I just love it. If you put it together the right way\nit will last a very long time. It has large pedals with ridges to prevent foot slippage but I slip sometimes. It has\ntransportation wheels for easy relocation but I keep mine in the family room near my TV. The weight limit is\n260 pounds.\nIt has dual action workout arms provide an upper body workout. It is made in China and it is 33 by 19 by 46 inches.\nThe natural elliptical motion eliminates any stress on joints and that is why I bought it. Love it! It has a easy dial\ntension adjustment for adjustable challenges. I started out on easy and worked my way up. It is lots of fun.;Love, Love, Love It!
32;12.0;5.0;44.0;"Arrived quickly, easy to put together. I noticed people were talking about poor quality- but it's $80. For $80 it is a great purchase. I have not experienced any of the wheel fibers breaking apart. I am 5'3"" and weigh 125 and my boyfriend weighs 180 and we both enjoy this elliptical regularly. I also don't think it's loud at all- there is no issue hearing the tv, music etc while using. Great alternative to a gym membership. I do wish that it had an incline";Solid machine for the price- buy it and get healthy now!
33;13.0;3.0;37.0;"1. So many parts to assemble! I wanted to cry when I pulled it all out of the box (see pic). But once it is out of the box there is no turning back! If you've never assembled a piece of furniture this might be too dificult for a first time project. But if you understand how to follow ""part A"" and ""bolt 3"" directions then it is possible to put together alone. It took me a couple hours - with a couple stress breaks.\n2. The reviews that say it slopes forward are correct! My toes felt like they were getting crammed into the toes of my shoes as I used it - painful. So I quickly stopped using it. I ended up getting a 4x4 piece of wood and propping up the front rail to make it feel level. Disappointing to have to make my own modification.\n3. Feels solid. For the price I was worried it would feel cheap - like a bucket of bolts or all plastic. It is neither. It feels very solid and like a steal for such a good price.";Good and bad points
31;14.0;1.0;34.0;I understand the appeal of a cheap elliptical, but I would strongly advise against purchasing this one especially as a holiday gift. Sprained my ankle after the metal bar connecting the left pedal to the left side of the elliptical broke while I was on it. I was willing to pass it off as a freak accident until I came on here and saw someone else had posted a similar review and pictures of the exact same break. It's barely seven months old. I weigh about 140lbs, well under the maximum capacity of the machine. I contacted the company using the provided support email and included the pictures below. So far I've heard nothing back.;Death trap
76;15.0;1.0;54.0;My 72 year old mom was very happy with it for one month, then she told me the chain had broken, now she has to buy another machine.;Chain Broke in less then a Month
36;16.0;1.0;31.0;I didn't buy this from Amazon but I wanted to leave a review to help out and give people the opportunity to keep their hard earned money.\n\nPros.\n1.light weight\n2.wheels (rolls into Corner easily)\n3.fairly quiet\n4.worked up a good sweat after 15 min.\nCons\n1. The stride is so short it's more of a stepper\n2.handlbars constantly get loose and jiggle and are placed stupidly. It felt like I was gripping for dear life.\n3.the body of the machine gets in the way of your workout .my legs were spread apart so awkwardly I started to cramp.\n4.the peddles are placed at an angle or tilt so it feels like you're skiing downward.\n5. The distance , speed, calorie count are all useless/ lies (time was only useful and accurate)\n6. Machine wobbles like crazy feels unstable\n7. You have to use the hand bars or else you might fall off unless you put the resistance high so you can get some type of balance.\n\nI YouTube and even searched for the machine tagged on IG it looked like it had pretty good movement  . I was wrong! I'd be upset if I paid 88bucks for this junk. I'm mad i got my hopes up! I'll stick it out as long as possible and then junk it ..most likely . Save your money !;Save Your Money .....
75;17.0;1.0;47.0;"Ordered this on February 26th and it arrived March 23rd.  They must have had it directly shipped from the oversees manufacturer.\n\nFirst problem is the description and video here says user weight capacity is 260 pounds, but the big warning sticker on the actual product says 250 lbs.  The foot pedals are unnaturally steep which makes you lean forward; they are also slippery, so you end up sliding forward to a point of squishing your toes.\n\nThe movement is not fluid at all on mine, but there is also a grinding type noise coming from the back of it.\n\nWhen you combine the steep pedals and the fixed arms this unit is downright dangerous, if you let go of the arms expect to be hit with them.  All in all this product was a complete waste of money.  I will probably try to return it.";Piece of Junk
73;18.0;1.0;43.0;This thing worked great for about a month.  It started to grind in the front flywheel and the pedal axle started to skip. I greased up the front flywheel. And it turns out the welding had come undone on the pedal axle. The part that connects to the pedal bars. I messed with it.  I fixed it with some good old J.B. Weld and worked fine for about 2 weeks.  I had been using this thing regularly for 3 to 4 times a week for 30 minutes.\n\nThe J.B. Weld worked held. But the front flywheel keeped getting stiff and tight. And it continued to grind.  It got to the point the front flywheel locked up.  I took it apart.  I tired to adjust the nuts and tension screws. It never was the same. It keeps grinding.  I see flakes of metal on the floor from the front flywheel.  For 99 dollars I expected it to fail.  But not so soon.  Dont waste your money.  Spending it on a decent one.  Like I am going to.  When it worked it was awesome.  But when it broke down.  It broke down.  Could not fix.  Not worth the hassle calling and complaining to the company.  Just write a review and help the next person.;Did not last long.
74;19.0;1.0;41.0;I bought this elliptical about a month ago. It was easy to put together and it worked well at first. I use this item four times for about 20 mins per time. On the fourth time the chain broke. I know you get what you pay for, but come on.  Save your money people and buy something else.;Worst item I ever bought from Amazon.
53;20.0;5.0;24.0;I'm a beginner and didn't want to spend a lot of money for an elliptical which may gather dust in my house. I was surprised with the quality of the elliptical - not flimsy and feels sturdy and well built.  No frills - but serves its purpose. Would recommend!;Great Value!
8;21.0;4.0;14.0;There are two problems with this product but they are both somewhat easy to overcome.\n\n1) You feel like you are going down hill. I built a frame out of wood which lifts the front up 3.5 inches and it now feels flat.\n2) It wobbles. Screwing it down to the frame made it feel stable.\n\nOne thing that was annoying during installation is one of the screws is reverse threaded and its counterpart on the other side is not. I noticed a sticker notifying the user of this after I figured it out, but there was no mention of it in the instructions.\n\nEven though it has some quirks, I feel comfortable using it, and I am getting good workouts on it. It is well worth the price.;Worth the price
65;22.0;4.0;29.0;I read all the reviews before purchasing this elliptical and I have to agree with those who were very pleased with their purchase.  It was relatively easy to assemble and is fairly quiet.  I did also notice the same forward lean others mentioned and I remedied that by propping the front bar on a wooden block and now I don't feel as though I'm going downhill when I'm using it.  I did also turn the handles outward rather than inward as advised to accommodate my reach. Overall, for the my purposes (indoor exercise for winter months) it's a great buy!;Great for the price!
21;23.0;4.0;18.0;Great product for the price. Very well packaged. A bit noisy. Make sure to check that your floor is level before placing the machine because mine wasn't so we need to put small books under it on either side. It was difficult to put together but not too bad. Overall very nice product. 4 stars because of the difficulty to put it together and how noisy it is. (Unfortunately my cat couldn't help me put it together. He just was lounging in the way);Great product
22;24.0;4.0;18.0;I really like my elliptical. I don't love it. Here is why: Day 1: it arrived in a jumbo sized box which was almost impossible to open. I get it open and all my pieces laid out. Instructions might as well have been written in chinese. But I'm a pretty smart girl so i studied the pics n re-read the instructions over and over before I got started. 45 minutes later I am on the 2nd to last step. These bolts won't go in for the life of me! After I struggle with it for 30mins I give up.\nDay 2: Friend comes over on his lunch break because I'm thinking maybe this thing needs a mans touch. He gets bolt 1 in less than 5 minutes. Yay! My excitement is short-lived because lunch break is over and bolt 2 is being a real a-hole.\nDay 3: My brother comes over and FINALLY my elliptical is assembled!! Let us rejoice! Except no because this thing moves! Like literally. I am riding this thing and it just inches its way across the room. In weird angles I might add. Just whereever it wants to go. So I placed the long cardboard L shaped peices up against the front and back legs to keep it from moving til i can get a rug or something. Def not made for tiles.\nAll in all I would recommend it because of the price but ONLY if you have someone willing to assemble it for you.;I really like my elliptical

37;26.0;2.0;19.0;A lot harder to set up than the manufactures want you to believe. Right now  deciding if I want to spend all night building this, or let it carry over into tomorrow. Either way a total headache.;A lot harder to set up than the manufactures want ...
24;27.0;4.0;16.0;"I needed a small machine and I didn't want to pay a thousand dollars for it, just in case it became a clothing rack in the corner of my bedroom. I was a little concerned when I read reviews that said it broke after a month or two, but then I read one which explained that you have to keep it well maintained, and that made sense. There are instructions in the manual on how to check the bolts and which areas to keep well lubricated. If mine starts to make a weird noise, I know to get off of it and check for loose screws or whether the machine is level. That's just the deal with any piece of equipment, whether it costs $100 or $5,000.\n\nPutting it together was a workout in itself, but I was able to do it alone, and with distractions from my kids and breaks for my back it took around 2 hours. Had I been in better shape and putting it together while my kids were in school, it probably would have gone much faster.\n\nMy one complaint is the little computer - I have yet to get the stupid thing to stay on just ""time"" or ""distance"" and not keep cycling through all of the options. I'm fairly tech savvy but this stupid little box has me stumped, lol. And yes, I followed the directions. Plus it's so low on the machine that it's hard to see while you're working out. I've taken to just setting a timer on my phone and leaving the little computer to do whatever it wants.\n\nOverall, I'm super happy. The elliptical works well, and is much nicer looking than I expected for the price.";Exactly what I wanted
19;28.0;5.0;15.0;"Ok guys, these is not only inexpensive but it hardly takes up any room at all!!  I was looking for a cheap eliptical that wasn't going to fall apart after a few uses.  Well I'm glad I ordered this. I ve had it for a couple months and it still works great. It's not wobbly at all (I weigh about 130lbs) and it has adjustable tension which is great.  It certainly isn't ""Top of the Line"" but it's worth the price. I think if your over 200lbs, it might be a bit wobbly though.  I love the fact that it has a digital display that shows the distance, speed, time, and calories.  It took me about an hour to put together and I did it by myself.";It's worth it!
14;29.0;5.0;13.0;I read so many reviews of the product before buying it and to tell the truth I was a little bit doubt if I was going to buy it or not.\nBut good thing I did buy it!\nIt takes some time to put it all together though, around 30 minutes.\nIf you are looking for something to help you do some exercise at home because you don't have time or money to go to the gym this is great and fits anywhere.\nI've been working out with this for almost two months everyday for around 40 to 50 minutes  and It's not a great great one like at the gym but it does the good job it is supposed to.\nMy weight is 190 and it didn't break till now lol\nIt makes a little bit of noisy but just put some oil once in a while.;Happy with it!!
47;30.0;5.0;17.0;I was a little skeptical at 255 lbs this might be wobbly or break before I could reduce. Happy to say it handles the weight fine and is much smoother and quieter than I expected and very effective at what it does. I thought it was odd that the handles fit a bit lose and cannot be tightened (odd because everything else seemed to be so well engineered and fitting), In practice this little play in the handles is never distracting. And the workout is unbelievable - wow leg burns! You can work different parts of the leg muscles by how you lean and when the legs are too tired switch to arm pulls or pushes to keep going. I like this a lot and the price sure is right.;Surprisingly GOOD
38;31.0;1.0;16.0;Clumsy, you feel like you will fall forward and the stride is too small. We sent it back.;We sent it back, you probably will too
7;32.0;3.0;10.0;This product is great but not intended for daily use. Mine came with a sticker that stated the weight limit was 250lbs. At the start I weighed 230 and now I weigh 210. This machine broke on my last night. I used it for 2 months, 4-6 times a week for 20-25 minutes a time. I wasn't sure how long it would last at $75 but I was hoping for a little longer than 2 months. Maybe if you weighed 130 instead of 230 it would last longer.;Broke after 2 months of heavy use.
13;33.0;5.0;10.0;This thing is kicking my butt, and I love it! I can only manage about five minutes at a time before the muscles in my legs need a break, but in the two months that I've owned it, I've lost fourteen pounds and 3% body fat. I've still got a long way to go, but it feels so GOOD to actually be working towards becoming a stronger person. I love how it's zero impact, as well. As a fat girl (211lbs as of today), medium to high impact exercises usually make my chest hurt thanks to my large breasts bouncing around (even with so-called high-impact sports bras), but I can even go sans-bra if I want when using this and there's no pain whatsoever in my chest or back!\n\nEven at my weight, the elliptical stays stable - no rocking around or anything, even without a mat. I love the wheels, too, which make it easy to tip and move out of the way when not in use.\n\nI didn't quite realize how much this had started to build up my strength until I had to run down the block the other day. Normally, I don't run. If I absolutely have to, I'd be winded with aching shins after just a few yards. But this time, I'd made it down the block and to my destination before I had even realized I wasn't hurting or gasping for air. Okay, so maybe that's not a big deal for normal, healthy people, but as a fat girl who's always been a little resigned about knowing she'd be one of the first to get eaten during the zombie apocalypse, it was a HUGE deal for me and it made me really proud of myself knowing I was on the right track towards becoming a stronger person.\n\nObviously, this machine is not whisper quiet or anything (since I've seen a few people asking), but it's not that noisy either. You can still listen to music or watch a show while you're working out, but you will have to turn it up a few clicks above your normal volume or use headphones.;This has been a great machine for me! This fat girl highly recommends this elliptical!
29;34.0;5.0;11.0;Its wonderful! Weve had it for a over a week and ive used it daily so has my Hubby. Its small and easy to move but also gives you a great workout! Very happy with this purchase;This Moms gonna loose 20lbs with the help of this!
62;35.0;1.0;15.0;My wife ordered this for herself. It looked exactly like what she needed. When it arrived, it was bigger and heavier than anticipated, but that didn't seem like a big deal at the time. As I unpacked the elliptical, it quickly became apparent that only through years of experience assembling old Erector Sets with missing parts and foreign instructions could I put this thing together. It's made up of a number of odd components with iffy design choices. Even following the instructions to the T, the thing was wobbly and stiff exactly where it shouldn't have been.\n\nUsing the machine was just as unpleasant. The foot pads are oddly shaped and poorly positioned, so there's no comfortable place to stand. That, coupled with the forward-leaning handles positions the user at an odd, front-heavy angle, with foot pads that don't lend themselves well to it.\n\nBut that wasn't an issue for long. After maybe an hour's worth of use, the main wheel of the elliptical locked up. It felt like it was jammed, but there was no easy way to get any sort of a look inside of the machine to figure out the issue. I was able to get it moving again by manually turning the wheel backwards -- unwinding it or something -- until it would then go forward again. The same issue has now happened no fewer than six times in under two weeks. Each time, working for shorter and shorter amounts of time.\n\nIf this locking, jamming issue is a defect of our unit in particular, other issues definitely weren't. The little washers between the arms and the base arm broke almost immediately. It didn't seem to have much of an effect on the handles, but it's disconcerting to see chunks of metal fall away from a brand new piece of equipment. On top of that, screws were constantly finding themselves coming loose. My wife would frequently stop mid-exercise to grab an Allen wrench in an effort to tighten the wobbling bits.\n\nIn all, it's been a really frustrating experience. It's only made worse knowing how much of a hassle this behemoth will be to disassemble and send back.\n\nDon't risk it. It's not worth the trouble. If it were any cheaper, or lighter, I'd just throw it away. Since it's neither, I can't recommend this to anybody.;Clunky, cumbersome, and broken
26;36.0;4.0;10.0;Definitely got more then I expect, the instructions were pretty straight forward. This product works great, I get a nice work out everyday I use it. The little reader is a pain to reset, but for the price, worth it.;Great product for the price

56;39.0;1.0;13.0;I got this in and immediately had issues after setting up. The wheel would keep locking up and sounded like the gears were jammed. Turns out, when they ship it too you, the resistance band inside is set to the highest level (THEY DO NOT TELL YOU THIS IN THE MANUAL). You have to physically lower the resistance before set up. Then after that, chance the resistance to a lower setting on the knob by the consul.\n\nAfter we adjusted the settings (on both resistances), it was much easier to use.\n\nThen I noticed random parts would just start falling out from the inside of the machine. I used it daily for about 30 minutes at a time, and it was falling apart from the inside out!\n\nLong story short, I bought a new, BETTER elliptical machine and I love it!\n\nThis elliptical machine, sucks.;Save your money
5;40.0;1.0;6.0;I agree with another reviewer that you get what you pay for.  I bought this for my wife for her birthday.  I just wanted to get something not too expensive she could use during the fall/winter months in between visits to the fitness center.  Assembly wasn't too difficult.  She used it for about 10 weeks when it locked up and you could not move the pedals and arms at all. I could not figure out how to get it out of its locked state so I contacted support through the form on their website. I got an instant auto-response back.  The service level expectation is 48 hours for a response time.  5 days went by and no answer.  I look up the product manual and see there is a call center number, although email is the preferred method of communication.  No one answers.  I go to voice messaging and leave a voicemail explaining my previous contact with no answer.  I provided my email address so that they could look up and respond to my inquiry.  Still nothing yet  Cheap product and horrible service.  Nothing more to be said.;Cheap product and horrible service
57;41.0;1.0;13.0;I did not like this machine at all. When I was using it it was all I could do to keep my feet from sliding off the foot rest. They are tilted too much and it is hard to stay in one place. I would not recommend for medium to heavy workouts.;not profitable for exercise
28;42.0;4.0;9.0;I'm 130 pounds i needed something for the house because I don't wanna drive to the gym and pay membership. This is perfect for cardio for smaller person.\n My husband is 6.2 feet 180 pounds and doesn't like it. The only thing I don't like is that it's a little wobbly. But it's okay for the price.;This is perfect for cardio for smaller person
6;43.0;1.0;6.0;First off it is really flimsy. Meaning it does not give a smooth motion which makes it hard to want to use this machine for any sort of longer duration. Second the way the foot rests are positioned your feet slide forward which makes it uncomfortable. The timer doesn't reset with each workout either.\n\nI literally used it 2 times for no more than 15 minutes at a time (I just couldn't get myself to use it longer due to the way the foot rests and the motions was) and it broke. It seized up and stopped working. I returned it. I wouldn't recommend this at all!!;Don't waste your time!
12;44.0;1.0;7.0;You get what you pay for.  It does what any basic elliptical would do.  I read other reviews that mentioned that the footpads are too angled, and definitely agree.  This leads to foot migration...and I have to wear shoes to keep from mashing toes.  It's just overall awkward and 5''5.  Kind of noisy, and I've tried everything to get the right hand grip to stop jiggling with no luck.  But for <$100, I honestly wasn't expecting much.\n\nUpdate - during it's 3rd use, it broke, and these pieces fell out of the main cavity.  Tension no longer works.  Do not buy.;Broke during 3rd use
54;45.0;3.0;10.0;I ordered on Nov 29 and received on Dec 4 through Amazon Prime free 2 day shipping. This is my first experience with an elliptical so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. My sister said it's how she lost her weight and I decided to give it a shot. The instruction book was overwhelming to me. It shows every single part separately with lines and numbers pointing to each piece, then a vertical listing of the names to each number. Some of the step by steps were confusing too, but I did it all by myself in about an hour and a half between meal breaks, etc. I used the tools provided. When it comes to attaching the foot pedal to the crankshaft, I had to use the #8 Allen Wrench at the same time as the flat wrench so it would tighten. This was a time I wished for another person with me, but I did it!\n\nTo those who missed the monitor, I found mine in a hole of the styrofoam, white box, taped inside. If I was in a rush, I would have totally missed it. It has a forward slant. I tried to correct by forcing myself to stand up straight against the slant, in so doing, my back started to hurt badly. I put a couple of old white phone books under each side in the front and that fixed the slant, I may get a board later. So far, it is acceptable as far as cheap machines go, but I am looking to upgrade later. I tightened the felt belt cause there didn't seem to be a difference in tension. That definitely worked, I can feel a difference now! If it lasts till I save up the money for my upgrade, then it'll be well worth it. I will update as time goes on to report my progress.\n\n12-17-14 UPDATE\nI ended up returning it to Amazon. Turns out, the felt tension belt has the ability to snap with extended use. I love Amazon!!! They are so great. I got a full return. Now I will invest in a better quality machine. The slant ended up being worse after I raised the front, then it was uneven. The levelers couldn't reach the floor no matter how much I unscrewed them. For those who need this info, this machine is jarring on your back.;MY VERY FIRST ELLIPTICAL!...
42;46.0;5.0;9.0;I absolutely Love this Elliptical machine. At first it felt a little like I was leaning forward, but then as I was getting used to it I straightened my posture, actually leaned a little bit back and it did feel right. Also because of this the feet felt like the toes were being squished at first, but then after you get used to it you can push your feet down with the momentum of the movement and your toes shouldn't go forward. It's harder to explain than actually do. My son has one of these and it's caused him to get in shape in a short amount of time. I think anyone would like this machine.;Elliptical machine is Awesome, I Really love it!!
17;47.0;5.0;7.0;"Perfect for my limited space but no one has really talked about weight loss which is why I bought it. 13 mins kicked my butt because I have been sitting on it for a year after loss of job. My grandsons dorm room is on the third floor (stairs only). Going up them is how my 13 minutes felt. Kept resting then went again. Will at least do another 10 minutes tonight. Issue of slipping forward and toes hurting did not happen because YouTube said use your heels and posture. I'm only 5'1"" so using handles is a stretch but ok. I gained about 20 lbs so I'm about 130 lbs. This is perfect low impact for this 67 year old.\nAssembly was not bad. I did it alone in about an hour. Just read carefully and use diagrams for bolt and washer placement. Also use LOCTITE BLUE 242 REMOVABLE to help with loosening issue.  Will Maintain as directed and see how it goes.\nPhoto shows how well it fits in my little bedroom!!";I think I'm going to love this
20;48.0;5.0;7.0;"I just set it up last night. The instructions were mostly clear, I've set things up before so I believe I'm pretty experienced in that department. It wasn't like IKEA instructions, so that's good. It was in English, without a million pages of other languages. It took about an hour and a half from opening the big 60 lb. box to completion. There were a lot of small parts and things to unpackage so that took the most time. There are 6 steps to it, but those steps are pretty simple to get through each part of them. Once it all was together, I used it and it kicked my butt. The timer is nice to have on it. The only ""CON"" I have about the entire thing and it could just be my shoes, my feet slide forward on the pedals. Maybe I'm supposed to have my toes jammed all the way up to the front, but that's not very comfortable. I think it would be good if I put down some sort of silicone or rubber material on the foot pedals so I don't slide around.\n\nAs per another reviewer on here, I did use Loctite with all the bolts. I used Medium Loctite incase I wanted to return it (Can you imagine disassembling it to put everything back in the box just the way it came to send back? No thank you), but I don't want to return it so that's a relief. I'll post back in a few months and let you know progress and what's working on it and if I still love it. Thanks!";Pro: Price, Ease of Putting Together, Instructions Con: Foot slippage toward front of pedals
10;49.0;3.0;6.0;Initially I was worried that I wouldn't get the elliptical put together but it looked worse than it was. I put it together by myself  (husband was at work) and it took me 90 min. I'm used to gym quality ellipticals so it does take some getting used to but for $100 and being so tiny it is definitely worth it.\n\nCONS)  The metal was discolored & even had some rust on the top part where the monitor mounts & after contacting Amazon I was offered 3 choices....1) return for full refund  2) exchange for a new one 3) get some money back & I really did not want to try to fit it back in the box or put another one together so I chose to keep it. The issue with it doesn't effect how it works, it is only cosmetic.\n\nA few more things I dislike about it...1) it is kind of loud....if I was listening to music with ear buds it wouldn't be noticeable  but I hoped I could watch morning tv & get in a work out but that's hard to do unless I blast the TV....2) the knob to adjust the tension is very loud & very annoying! I hate that there are no numbers it's simple + or - and u turn it in either direction but the dang knob just keeps turning so I don't have a clue if the tension is even moving...I'd like to increase it little by little for a better workout but there is no real way to gauge that. 3) the foot pedals seem to point downward instead of staying flat while using it which hurts my toes/feet\n\nPROS)  it is really light weight & can be easily moved into my living room & back out every day. Even with the issues I have I still think if ur short on space & cash this isn't a bad buy;Not bad.....not great either
11;50.0;1.0;6.0;"I read the reviews carefully before buying this item, and it seemed from other reviews that if assembled and cared for properly this machine would work, so I bought it. While it was packaged well and easy to assemble, it has critical design flaws that make it impossible to use as an elliptical.\nAn elliptical is meant to simulate running. In order to do this it is necessary that as you run, one foot is on the ground and the other is moving forward. For this to work, when one pedal is flat (at the botton of its arc) the other should be tilted upward so that you can push forward with your other foot. However, for this elliptical when one pedal is flat the other is tilted DOWNWARD, making it impossible to propel your motion forward using your feet. While you can still use the elliptical by pushing forward with your hands, a properly designed machine should not require you to do that. The hand rails should be there for balance only, and using them for propulsion compromises the quality of your workout and could result in injury.\nOther customers complained that the stride is very small, which I found to be true. For reference, I am 5'3"".\nIn addition, the unit is very wobbly.\nI've built a lot of self-assembly devices, and I followed the instructions exactly, so I know that is was assembled correctly and that the problems I encountered are the result of a design flaw, not an assembly error.\nI've used many machines, and the elliptical is my favorite. However, coming from a medical family I am aware that some methods of exercise can be more harmful to your body than good. In my opinion use of this machine is likely to cause stress and tension, and will not help you work out the muscle groups that you are trying to focus on.\nI am returning this product. I do not recommend purchasing it, as it is difficult to take apart and repackage for return.\nI would not buy another product from the same manufacturer again.";Basic Design Flaw. Bad Product.
79;51.0;5.0;12.0;Given that this machine is only $99, it's a great deal. It is easy to assemble, with all nuts/bolts/washers in a clearly labeled blister pack and decently-written instructions (a first!). When adjusted properly to its spot on the floor, it's stable with minimal side-to-side wobble when in use (there will always be SOME movement with a small machine like this). Since it's only about 50 lbs, it's easy to move around if necessary. So, all-in-all, IMO it's a great buy!;Well designed, inexpensive elliptical trainer.
43;52.0;1.0;8.0;Bought this elliptical through competitor's website. Worked great for about 3 months.  Recently hopped on it and it broke - the metal piece that connects right stepper to gear/sprocket snapped.  The broken metal gashed my leg - thankfully not deep but still have scar.  I'm about 205 lbs, so pretty sure I didn't overload it.  More alarming is that I left a message at manufacturer's contact number and never heard back from company.  Thankfully, I contacted the competitor who provided me with a full refund on the condition that I ship the unit back to them (free shipping).  The competitor asked if I wanted a new elliptical (same make and model) and I politely declined concerned that the workmanship was terrible.;This Machine Broke, Injured Me and Manufacturer Never Responded to Voice Message
30;53.0;2.0;7.0;Well It was $88 and it works so I guess that's all you can really expect. A few problems with the design...  It's not a smooth motion, pretty jerky, and the tighter you make the resistance the smoother the motion is but then the belt gets hot! The one thing I do like about it is it requires more work on your part to keep going, I feel like a lot of the machines just go with momentum. A big problem, which may have to do with the jerky motion, is the angle of the peddles. It's super uncomfortable and your foot is pushed into the front of the peddle. Talk about uncomfortable. I will use it because it does work and you don't waste time driving to the gym. I have a feeling the belt is going to break very soon since it is working against constant heat and friction.;Jerky motion, poor design, gets hot
58;54.0;5.0;9.0;I love my elliptical exercise bike. This is exactly what I need to get myself in shape. I try to use it every day, sometimes I miss a day. But I am working on it. Wish I gotten the one with the seat, so I can sit when my legs get tired. I put it together myself, I didn't think I could do it, but I did. I'm so proud of myself.;Great Product
15;55.0;5.0;6.0;I've been using this every day since it arrived, which was 19 days ago and I really enjoy it.  Installation was fine. All very clear instructions and easy to do. The screw on the right foot came loose a couple times during use, so I just keep my allen wrenches nearby in case I need to tighten them up. Since the last tightening a week ago, they have been stable. It could be that I simply didn't tighten them enough the first time.\n\nIt was really quiet at first, but now it has started making an annoying clicking sound. I think something inside is rubbing up against the plastic casing where the belt is. I may open it up and see if I can fix it. It's not too bad though, and this unit is over all really convenient and low maintenance. On a personal note, I've lost 12 pounds since getting it. I use it every day for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour (I've also changed my diet). For the price, this machine is great, hence the 5 stars. If were more expensive, I'd probably give it 4 because of the little things.\nI have actually recommended it to real live friends.;Easy to use, effective. Highly recommend.
61;56.0;1.0;9.0;This looks like a good bargain and I guess you get what you pay for. It is very stiff to walk on and isn't very stable. Wish I could get my money back and put it towards a better one.;Flimsy

16;58.0;5.0;6.0;"I'm giving this unit a 5 start review because (and I stress this) it's almost exactly what I expected it to be, only slightly better. After a great deal of research, I came to the conclusion that to get a really good elliptical that would last for years, you have to drop at least $1,500. So we decided to go the cheap route, buy this elliptical and assume it would break after 3 months at which point we'd either get another or do something different.\n\nWe've had it 3 months and it still appears to be working fine and not giving any signs of wear and tear that would indicate imminent breakage. That's almost daily use of about 20-40 minutes. So as of right now, I'm very happy and think we're ahead in this gamble.\n\nHere's the catch;\n\nAfter 3 months of use I've lost about 40 pounds. I noticed that when I first started using this machine, that it would wobble back and forth despite all attempts to steady it.\nAs I lost weight, it stopped doing that.  My wife (I'm writing the review, we share the account) has complained that the machine is steady but she finds that the hand grips are at an awkward distance for her. For me, they seem to be a good distance and I'm comfortable when on the machine now that it no longer wobbles back and forth.\n\nI'm getting the impression that if you're between 5 '4 and 5'10 (my wife is 5 '2 and I think she's just  a bit to short for it) and weigh no more than 160-180 pounds (I was about 190 when I started), that this machine will work nicely for you.  It's a good machine for doing a brisk workout. I wouldn't want to try to do any serious speed workouts on it.\nAlso, for those wondering the little digital readout is absolutely useless (I expected it to be and it did not disappoint my expectations).\n\nBut people, this is an elliptical for $90.00. What did you expect?";only slightly better. After a great deal of research
40;59.0;4.0;7.0;For this price point, my expectations were pretty low. This is a basic, no frills elliptical. It took me about an hour to assemble it, but the instructions were clear and I didn't have a hard time figuring it out. It fits in a smaller space than I expected it to, which is nice since I live in a small apartment. It is pretty easy to move it around. It's a little louder during use than I thought it would be, but not so much that it'll bother my downstairs neighbors. It feels durable, but we'll see. I will update this review if I encounter any issues. Very happy with this purchase so far.;Can't beat the price
41;60.0;4.0;7.0;It's great for what it is--a cheap machine. I had a high quality elliptical years ago where I just breezed through work outs. This one requires a lot more physical strength to get it going than the more expensive ones, but I suppose that ads to the workout. It's loud--I can't watch a show on my laptop while on it, but I can watch a show on the TV where I can turn the volume up. Another con is that the screen where you monitor your distance, time, etc. is pretty low and if you've got poor vision, it's difficult to see.\n\nSet up was super easy and took me (a small framed female) just about 45 minutes to assemble. The directions are not great if you are not a visual learner--there are few words/explanations, but lots of pictures.\n\nOverall, it's a fine machine. It's pretty small and compact. I don't hate it. Now I just have to use it more frequently....!;It's great for what it is--a cheap machine
23;61.0;1.0;6.0;This is complete and utter garbage. I wish I could get a refund for this tremendous waste of money. Broke under the pressure of my tiny 100 pound wife. Don't waste your money.;Broke within 6 months
44;62.0;3.0;7.0;I put this together myself. I'm a 15 year old girl however I am pretty strong but this took 3 hours by myself and was extremely stressful and the manual is impossible to read because it is extremely complicated. So I just gave up on the manual and did it myself which did work out at the end but I had a few extra screws but the machine works just fine with me. Now here are some cons 1) the screws constantly get loose every time you use the machine therefore you have to screw it back on ( with hand or with wrench which is provided and extremely easy to use ) . 2) THIS ONE I AM STILL MAD ABOUT ! the computer thing that tells you how many calories you burned and etc didn't even come !!! It was missing ! Boy was I disappointed ! However you can just Google your weight and how many calories you would burn for a certain amount of time.  They did offer me a replacement but hell no!!! I'm not taking everything apart only to do it again. They also offered me a 40% off my purchase which is what I am doing. This looks extremely unprofessional and that is why I gave a lower rating. So far so good.  The machine is extremely squeaky however but if you are someone older that wants to do something light then this is the machine for you. If you are about 120 and going intense then this is not for u;I'm a 15 year old girl however I am pretty strong but this took 3 hours by myself and ...

It worked great for a week or two and then it started getting louder and louder until it eventually just broke.  Uhhhhh and now I have to take it apart and ship it back.  I'm so irritated.;DO NOT BUY
27;64.0;1.0;6.0;I have previously owned 2 cheap ellipticals. They were literally the same exact model as this one but from different companies. Both of those lasted me roughly 2 years before a minor break. This one, though, has been with me for just a few weeks and busted dangerously. While I was in the middle of using it, the bar that goes along the back right pedal snapped. I could have been seriously hurt. Definitely not a weight issue as more than 100 pounds less than the limit. Fortunately since I bought it from my beloved Amazon I'm able to return it (now I just have to figure out a box since I foolishly threw it away!).;Didn't even last a month :(
72;65.0;1.0;10.0;I made the mistake of being cheap and ignoring the reviews on this. I received thisnabout a month and a half ago and use it 4 times a week at 30 minutes each time. The machine has metal shavings coming off and it isnmaking the screaching and lunking noise other people have mentioned. It is also becoming difficult to use as it feels like it is locking up. Spend a little more and get a nice one that will last more than a month or two. Don't make the same mistake I did!;Don't waste your money
78;66.0;4.0;10.0;"This basic machine is fine.  It was easy to assemble.  The weight of the built machine is refreshingly light.  It works as it should.  The digital display is a little dark and angled for someone a lot shorter than me.  I'm 5'6"".  Unless you have a lamp shining nearby, you may find yourself bending down to read the black numbers on the small screen.  Don't bother spending more on an extra fancy elliptical machine.  The hand grips are comfortable and adjustable.  The foot pads don't move independently from the bars that spin the wheel so sometimes my feet slide down to the front where I feel pressure on the front of my toes.  It's nothing that would deter me from avoiding working out.  I'll just move my feet back a few inches and keep on keepin on.  This model is all you need to get the workout done.  Will I have to eventually replace the nylon strap after it wears thin?  Will I have to take it apart once a year or so to lube up the joints?  Shipping was super fast.  I am satisfied with my purchase.  Let's see if I can remain disciplined enough to work out frequently to truly test the long-term quality of this bargain.  If it lasts a year, then I'll have gotten my money's worth.";An Affordable Fitness Equipment Staple

52;68.0;4.0;7.0;"This elliptical came well packaged.  The instructions were a bit difficult to follow.  Example: remove the 2 washers, 2 washers and 2 washers.  Not a real problem if you've assembled several items in the past, but can be extremely frustrating and/or difficult if you are not used to assembling yourself projects.\n\nThe machine is sturdy and works well.  HOWEVER... the angle of the handles forces you to lean forward if you are of short, or average stature, as they are a far reach from the pedals.  The stride length and width are perfect for a short person, but probably too short for a tall person.\n\nI'm on the fence with this one.  I'll have to rig up boards under the front of the machine to make it safe for me to use. I'm 5'2"" and I simply have to reach too much to reach the handles and this puts in a forward leaning position, which is simply a recipe for injury.  If I were taller, I'd live with the angle of the pedals and be happy with the machine.\n\nThe machine does not take up much space, easy to move around, gives a great work out, and is minimal in noise.";Great exercise equipment IF you are average or tall stature.
35;69.0;1.0;6.0;Bought this earlier this year and it already broke.  The belt was extremely loud.  I would try to use this early in the morning before everyone else was up, but it was very loud and would wake my family.  Very disappointed.;Built poor and very loud
49;70.0;3.0;6.0;"Not bad for the money, however, it is NOT like the ones in the gym.  It's very ""choppy"" and not smooth when you pedal.  the pedals are angled high so your feet slip forward in the foot piece.  I purchased the skid strips and attempted to stick them in the foot piece, it helps some but they will need to be glued in order to stay put.  It's made well, I also have a exerpeutic recumbent stationary bike that is a very nice piece of equipment.

46;74.0;3.0;5.0;I've owned Orbitrek and Confidence Ellipticals. The Exerpeutic is very similar - in fact I would guess they are built in the same factory as Confidence, or at least many of the parts are. However, the Exerpeutic adds some reinforcement under the pedals, which are usually the first to go, as well as some balancing screws as others have mentioned. I didn't find those screws necessary. Also, the arms are installed using permanent bolts, whereas the Confidence used hand screws that needed retightening every use or two. With the pedal reinforcement, this one outlasted the others I've had, but eventually the hole for the bolt wore out and the bolt fell out. Without the reinforcement, usually the bolts break first. All these low end units fall apart, and I had several pieces fall out of this one with no real consequences before this. But at this price, I give it 3 stars for surviving around two years of 30 minute rides about three times a week by a 200 lb. man. At this price I don't mind buying a new one every couple of years. I will probably buy another, but may take a crack at borrowing some parts from my last Confidence model that's still sitting broken on the sidelines from right before this one! Yeah, I could have bought a fancy model for a grand, but it probably would have only lasted 3 years. I've been fairly consistent about doing elliptical for going on 10 years. My secret is to watch action shows. A good show makes me forget I'm exercising, more so than music, and the buzz from the action and the buzz from exercising are mutually enhancing.;A good show makes me forget I'm exercising
50;75.0;4.0;5.0;It is what it is - an elliptical for home use under $100. For that, it is not bad. I have used it 5 times a week for 40+ minutes per time for the past month and it has held up okay. It is a bit noisy since it works off a resistance strap and I have had to tighten the bolts once already, but overall not too bad. The only real negative I have is that the leveling bits keep going loose so about 10 minutes into the workout (every single time), the machine gets out of balance. A minor nuisance but something that could have been avoided by using a known-good leveling mechanism instead of loosely-fitting rounds on the back legs.;Not bad for the price

66;77.0;5.0;6.0;I was a little skeptical about buying an elliptical that was so affordable because my first instinct is cheap=cheap quality. But NOT AT ALL! This elliptical is pure awesomeness and I recommend you buy it.\nPros - Affordable, easy to move, not super noisy, easy to store or small enough that it isn't troublesome to have out, makes your thighs burn like no tomorrow i.e. it works!\nCons - I'm sure there are cons but I can't think of any....\nIf you're hunting for an elliptical, BUY THIS ONE.;OMG I love it!

68;79.0;4.0;6.0;"I've had this machine for about 2 weeks now. It took my fiance about 1 hour to put the whole thing together - he said the instructions were not the best but he was able to figure it out.\n\nI am not one who typically goes to the gym, so I have limited experience with nice, quality ellipticals. However, this one is getting the job done.  Stability is pretty decent - I'm not that worried about it tipping over or anything.  I've used it about 10 times in the past two weeks and it has performed well.  The little ""computer"" is really hard to read, so I just use my phone to keep track of my time.  But it is nice to see at the end of my workout how many calories I've burned and how far I've gone.  Just don't plan on relying on the computer while you work out unless you have super-human sight.\n\nOnly other thing I wish it had would be straps on the pedals to better anchor your feet to the pedals.  Other than that, I am pretty pleased with this purchase.  Quite cheap for the workout I am getting!\n\nWill update it if there are any problems after more use!";Decent for the price

75;1.0;3.0;439.0;I bought this thing to be low impact and help get me active to lose some weight.  I use it for 20minutes a day M-F. I'm averaging 85 steps a minute.  When I bought it I was at 320 LBs with the doctor approved goal of 250 LBs.  I'm a big muscular guy.\n\nWeek 1: 315\nWeek 2: 314\nWeek 3: 308\nWeek 4: 304\nWeek 5: 303\nWeek 6: 299\n\nAll in all I'm pretty happy with my results.\n\nThe size of the thing is pretty small and its really light and easy to move around with 1 hand.  It took less than 10 minutes to put together.\n\nEdit:  The thing broke 2 weeks after I wrote this review. The metal bar on the right pedal snapped in 2.  When it happened I was not injured. I just now saw the comments asking about how sturdy this is.  I don't blame the equipment because I'm a big guy.  While this thing was quick and a good start it didn't last long (2 months). But it got me motivated to do what I needed which was start exercising.;Weight Loss
36;2.0;1.0;225.0;Stepper worked great for a month and the welding snapped right off. I contacted Sunny Health through email and they kept giving me a run around.  Asked me to send picture so I did. They said they cannot open the picture files. The pictures were taken with my phone and they are normal jpeg files. I took more pictures with same phone and sent them again. This time they said they cannot see where the break was on the pictures. I took 20 more pictures from all different angles and resent them.  About 3 weeks after I initiated this process they finally said they will send thereplace parts.  This was 4 months ago and I have not received any parts.... I highly recommend buying a different company's product than Sunny Health & Fitness.  Bad product and worse customer service.....;BAD PRODUCT AND WORSE CUSTOMER SWERVICE
3;3.0;1.0;6.0;When I purchased this product it was a 5 - star. It was a great compact design. It was a great whole body work out. Now two years later the product is almost unusable. The weld on the main bracket has cracked. I am only 160lbs. 5-10 male so this product should have no problem. I would help my experience with this product would steer people away.;This product does not hold up - look elsewhere
88;4.0;3.0;200.0;Hubby purchased this as a surprise for my birthday! OMG, I lost 7 pounds in one week from working out on this little machine. The size was perfect, the work out great. I got so I was looking forward to my first thing in the morning 800 on this as I caught up on the morning news.\n\nSadly, it broke yesterday. The bolt that holds the cable to the fly wheel broke. We cannot find a part that matches it. Sunny Health and Fitness did respond promptly to my email but seem to be giving me the run around with requests to send a picture of the broken bolt...well measure the bolt, do you have the recpt? Scan it and send that to us.\n\nThe recpt. was thrown away when we got this as the place we got it from will NOT refund for any reason at all.\n\nNeedless to say, I will get another stair stepper...just not this brand nor at places like Marukai that will not be flexible with customers.;Great machine...while it lasts
2;5.0;4.0;203.0;It was pretty easy to assemble and sturdier than i thought it would be.  I had bought one without a handle at sports authority years ago but this one was much better.  the steps are plenty big enough for your feet and the whole thing is fairly sturdy.  it is also light weight which makes it easy to pull out in front of the tv to step.  the only thing i wasn't sure about was that there is a pulley underneath and the steps go a bit sideways as well as up and down.  This is good because you can adjust the resistance more than other kinds but it felt akward on my knee joints at first.  now that i am getting used to that aspect i think it is a nice piece of equipment for the price.  no trouble with delivery or anything.;Great little piece of exercize equipment
60;6.0;5.0;134.0;I'm an exercise professional and bought this for home use when we moved to the beach and there were no near-by gyms.  I was a little skeptical because it was inexpensive.  But it's GREAT! It's a solid piece of equipment that has held up perfectly for over a year now!  I also was skeptical that I'd get a good work out from it since some home workout equipment is too easy but it is a good workout!  The tension adjusts easily without having to get off the machine so I can start out warming up with lots of support to make it easy them turn the dial to increase the speed an get a harder workout!  It is extremely light weight and easy to move around.  I was able to move it anywhere in the house I wanted to exercise simply and easily.  I love that it's designed with the foot pedals at a perfect angle to strengthen hip muscles.  It's also a great angle to protect the knees.  I like the way it tracks the number of steps in a single work out and over time.  What an awesome value!  Thanks Sunny Health & Fitness for making an affordable, solid product.;Great Value!!
16;7.0;5.0;57.0;"We wanted a stair-stepper, but didn't have space for a standard one. This solved the problem.  We tuck it in a corner that measures 20 x 20 inches and bring it out when we're ready to use it... it's that easy to move!  It may seem a little ""tippy"" due to its light weight, but that goes away as soon as you put your weight on it. It's really remarkably designed and well constructed. It will have you breathing hard in a few minutes, and the resistance can be adjusted to increase your level of exertion. Due to its small size, it may not be perfect for a large man. But if you're average sized and need a stepper but don't have space for a big one - this is a great quality product for a reasonable price.";A big workout in a small space
52;8.0;5.0;113.0;I am around 163 pounds\n27 years old\n5'4 and this little thing got me tired by even just 30 seconds into the workout. I did not want to give up just yet because I really wanted to get my money's worth. I had eaten two Subway Oatmeal cookies which total 400 calories. I really wanted to burn those suckers off. But with only doing 1442 repetitions in 30 minutes, I managed to burn 205 calories (that's what the monitor read).\n\n**PROS**\n\n1) It will get the job done. I know it's cheap and looks like it's not a lot, but it got my front thighs and my upper butt cheeks on fire. I would love a full and firm butt not only for looks but your butt muscles are the biggest muscles and if those are firm, they really  help out with your metabolism (Or so Leslie Sansone said). I was really tired on the first round but I had to push myself.\n\n2) You can adjust the tension/resistance at the bottom front if you want to push yourself. I had to loosen it. it's really tough work.\n\n3) It's not heavy at all or takes up a lot of room. No, it cannot fold for lower storage.\n\n4) It does record your time, your repetitions, and calories burned.\n\n5) The machine will not reset your progress. So, if you stop working out like to go to the bathroom or answer the door, it will pause until you come back.\n\n6) It does not make a lot of noise.\n\n**CONS**\n\n1) The machine is very simple, meaning there's not a lot to it. For example, there's no place to hold your remote or water bottle.\n\n2) It does not record your heart rate.\n\n3) The manual instructions was a little confusing despite putting it together around 30 minutes. There was a picture in the instructions with all the parts creating a skeletal scene of it, and that was rather more helpful than the actual instructions.\n\n**NEUTRAL**\n\n1) The stem coming up does rock a little, but not much (It could just be the way that I set it together). Sometimes I'm afraid to even lean on it.\n\n2) I'm 5'4 as described earlier, but getting on it makes me feel like I'm too tall. The machine is not very leveled, as if it makes me feel like there was a part I missed that I did not install.\n\nOverall, I love the machine. It's not perfect, but I'm glad I'm getting something out of it. I will continue to give some updates as I go becuase I read that this thing does break apart earlier than expected. So, we'll see.\n\n2/16/14 Update\nI'm continuing on the stepper and you guys have no idea how much my upper buns are on fire. This stuff is VERY tough and I don't even have it on high resistance. It's TOUGH! I don't really feel it as much in my back leg, but rather my front thighs, but the butt area is the worst. That's what makes you want to get off.\n\n3/2/14 Update\nThe stepper is still going strong and the workout is still very tough. I managed to get past 30 minutes and into maybe 45 minutes becuase I played a video game and that really got me distracted from the workout.;Tedious Workout
86;9.0;2.0;114.0;"This just arrived so it's too soon to say, but I REALLY miss my Aspen stepper that lasted forever and would probably still be going strong if I hadn't lent it to my kids who left it out in the rain and ruined it.\n\nPROS:  It was relatively easy to assemble; it's made of steel rather than plastic; it has a built in timer (also a scan, calorie counter and stroke counter), but the accuracy of these things is dubious at best, and I'm not one to use them anyway; it doesn't take up much space and is easy to move.\n\nCONS:  The tension adjustment knob is a joke.  From the easiest to the most difficult setting is so subtle, I barely noticed it.  Even at the most difficult setting, going as fast as I could, I didn't perspire at all; for people who are used to steppers, the twisting motion is a bit awkward, and since it came with no exercise instructions, perhaps there's something I'm missing to the advantages of twisting; at full extension, the handle bars don't go up very high, and they don't move.\n\nIf you're someone just embarking on an exercise routine, don't want to spend a lot of money and don't have a lot of space, this will probably work just fine.  However, for the athletically inclined who already work out regularly, this will probably be a bit of a disappointment.\n\nUpdate:  Have now had this for a while and need to mention that 1) the tension adjustment knob does work but ONLY WORKS IF YOU LET THE STEPPER SIT FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS.  If you try adjusting it without letting is sit undisturbed, you will NOT feel any difference; and 2) the 250# weight limit is a joke.  My husband, who weighs 195, can't use it at all.  If he does, the cable screws (as others have commented) break off.  He's handy, so he's been able to fix it each time, but after 3 or 4 times, he just will no longer use it.  For me, it's not much of a work out, but I do use it.\n\nUpdate a little over a year later:  The cable broke, and the manufacturer has been unresponsive.  So into the trash it sadly goes.  Due to a major design flaw in construction, the cable is forced to stretch, wear down and eventually break with use over time.  A hydraulic resistance system would be a major design improvement.  So if you don't mind a machine that will only last about a year, this stepper is fine.  But if you want something that will last longer, I'd give it a miss.";It's Okay
80;10.0;4.0;103.0;I do like this machine, and after a while of excersizing I'm sweating and my legs are a bit tired. The thing I don't like about this machine is that it's moderately slow and makes squeaking noises as it moves. I excersize 20 minutes then break for 10, and I kinda OD it because I do this from 4:00pm-8:00pm, and 30 minutes straight in the morning. Im in high school, so my hours are pretty flexible. I give it 4 stars, only because it's slow and squeaky. But other that that, I do like it and I would recommend it to anyone:) also,  the assembly was pretty easy, took about 20 mins. This does not fold up, and is awkward to carry. I hope this helped:);Pretty good
33;11.0;5.0;43.0;Easy to put together I love it\nHope to loose some weight;Good stepper love the handle bar
1;12.0;4.0;68.0;Decided I needed a stepper in addition to my treadmill.  I could not afford the Bowflex stepper.  This item was in my price range and meets my expectations. Can get a very good workout, has the readout recording the time, calories, and number of steps.  I am very pleased.;Just as described in the listing
9;13.0;1.0;17.0;"I purchased this at the beginning of January 2017, and today it broke (May2017). The tension cord snapped. I'm 5'7"", 150lbs, so not likely due to my weight.\n\nAlso when you raise tension,  The calorie counter does not take that into account. Additionally there's no way to enter your weight and have a calculate it thoroughly. I would say it's just a random guess.";It broke after 4 months
66;14.0;1.0;38.0;I've owned this product for 35 days and enjoyed it while it lasted. However, it broke and I am unable to return it to Amazon because I have exceeded the return time frame, no warranty from manufacturer (Sunny Health Fitness).\n\n1. I am male and weight 180LBS, product was used for 30-40 minutes a day 6 times per week.\n2. The longer you use it, the hotter the actuators get and the weaker the resistance becomes.  After 30 minutes, both actuators have very little resistance.\n3. Handle bar always gets loose due to hardware backing out, the supplied lock washers do very little to help this condition.\n4. Right pedal broke at the pivot attach point, tube sheared and it's unrepairable.\n5. Don't waste your money if you are planning on using this product for moderate/heavy workouts.;Poor Construction

57;16.0;5.0;34.0;I bought this stepper for my 80 year old Dad. He had 2 knee replcements and doesn't move around very much anymore.  He loves this little stepper, uses it everyday with ease. Thinking of getting one for myself. Love that it has a stationery handle for people who need the stability.;Step Away!
64;17.0;1.0;35.0;Was working great for four months. I was back in shape using this. Then it broke. Came apart at the weld.;was great till it broke.
5;18.0;4.0;12.0;My husband put this together for me.  He said it was pretty easy. Did not take long.  Must say step is short if you do not want to keep hitting the metal bar on bottom.  Do not like how it feels to hit the bottom.  So I try to avoid it and thinking it would be easy, no way.  Its a workout. Hubby told me to start out slow.  Not to go to fast at first.  So I watch TV , go a slower pace and really feel it in my calves.  Even loosing the tension, it is not easy, but do I really want it too easy.  I want to loose weight and watch my shows and exercise.  I would buy it again.;Twister
68;19.0;1.0;32.0;I like this machine,  with the handles is so secure and I can watch tv while exercising, I can really feel my body is working out, my legs are stronger now and its great for cardio. I can use it whenever I want, the price is great for such a sturdy machine, doesnt take too much space in the room , i put it in corner, it is easy to clean, im really pleased ive bought this item!\n\nWell I thought this was a good machine but it just lasted barely 2 month of use, it worked well but i weight 170 lbs and it didntlast enough for the price paid , what a shame :(;Didnt last
8;20.0;1.0;11.0;Broke a few weeks after I got it.  I weigh 180lbs.  This thing is a flimsy piece of crap.;Buy something else.
49;21.0;5.0;25.0;I really like this stepper. It is inexpensive. it was easy to setup, and it does a good job. I decided to go on a diet and start exercising and this was the first thing I decided to buy. I have a realIy small apartment and didn't not want a huge workout machine in my home so I decided to by this little stepper.\nI weigh 170 and I really would like to get down to about 130. I eat really unhealthy, if you saw what I eat in a day you'd wonder how I'm either not dead from a heart attack or 500 pounds overweight. By eating a whole lot better ( which was really hard for me) and using this for about 20 minutes a day I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks. Stepping on a scale and seeing a decrease in weight is such an awesome feeling. I hope to keep going and lose more weight. And if you are reading this and trying to lose weight good luck and you can do it as long as you put your all into it!;Really nice
14;22.0;2.0;10.0;"I loved this thing when it arrived. It is true that it is very hard to pedal, even at the lowest setting, as other reviewers have mentioned (I am in my 20's with strong legs, and walk several miles a week to get to school and to public transportation). But even that is not the reason I'm giving a low review.\n\nI wanted to keep using this stepper. I loved the easy exercise at home, and how refreshed I felt after using it (I have a congenital disorder causing very high insulin, requiring a strict diet and exercise program). Diet alone wasn't nearly enough to get my insulin under control, and this machine was really helping me with insulin-related sleepiness and visceral fat (weight you gain from hormones, only around the middle and not other areas of the body). For reference, I'm 5'4 and about 150 lbs. When I got this, I was about 4 or 5 pounds heavier, I think. I kept having the sensation that the handle bars were in the wrong place; maybe someone taller would find it more comfortable. I kept having to lean forward, which caused lower back pain and knee pain. The back pain subsided as I gained strength - the knee pain did not.\n\nThis stepper is a straight path to a hip and knee injury. I understand that it said ""twister"" stepper, but until you exercise with lateral twisting on your hips and knee joints, you don't realize how uncomfortable it is. I was expecting lateral movement like an elliptical, but it's more like the sensation of someone holding your leg and twisting it clockwise and counterclockwise repeatedly. My boyfriend, who is in extremely good shape from hard outdoor labor 40 hours a week, tried it and couldn't stand how the exercise felt. He said, ""something just seems wrong about how this moves."" I'm now seeing a physical therapist at a top research hospital for joint issues for the first time in my life, and she recommended I stop using it. She said I should use a regular stepper (without twisting) or a reclining bike, or walking in a pool until my hip recovers.\n\nThis is stable, sturdy, and well-constructed/durable, but it is not ergonomic, and that matters much more than I thought it did when I purchased.\n\nIf you have absolutely no joint issues and plan to exercise infrequently, this stepper might be for you.  But make sure you are prepared to take on the risk of possible joint injury.";I loved this stepper, but it's a high risk choice for joints
77;23.0;5.0;25.0;"My heart rate really gets going with this compact little stepper. Construction is strong and sturdy. Assembly was a piece of cake. I didn't bother installing the counter/timer because those things tend to be junk. I bought a digital timer with a magnetic back instead and attached it to the frame.\n\nI was concerned about the ""twister"" part of this product because I didn't know what it was and was concerned it might be something I wouldn't want. The twist just pertains to the angle of the foot pedals. Your feet are not pointed straight ahead. They're angled inward a bit at the toes. It's hard to describe, but it feels more natural than another stepper I had that kept the feet entirely parallel and it works the hips.\n\nAdjusting resistance is quick and easy. Just the turn of a knob.";A real workout
73;24.0;3.0;23.0;It's been 3.5 weeks since I've been using the Sunny Twister Stepper with Handle Bar and I have no complaints that are major yet. Putting it together was not hard. When I started using it, boy, was it hard on my knees. But, after a couple of uses stepping on and off every few minutes I got adjusted to it. I'm able to stay on for 45 minutes straight after adjusting the pressure and finding what's right for me to start with.\n\nBe prepared to sweat. After 5 minutes I am starting to sweat a lot, that's how I know I'm getting my pennies worth with this machine and a good work out. The showing of the calories, time and step does help. It also shows the total steps used since stepping on the machine. I've become so comfortable with the machine that I find myself using my weights to work the upper part of my body using good control while stepping.\n\n* What I don't like is the squeaky noise it makes while in use, which I can live with that. Also the screws at the bottom does tend to become lose a lot so just tighten it once in a while.\n\n***********Update 9/8/2012\n\nThe bolt that holds the cord for the steps broke, so now the steps do not work. It's been a few months so I can say longevity is a D-. I was very happy with this machine, but unfortunately that's come to an end. Im not able to replace the bolt and have to waste money on another machine, not the same machine of course. For future customers to the company, since this is a problem, put a replacement bolt as I have seen others complain of the same issue. Its no good having a product that only last 2 months as you want repeat customers on all your products. I have change my original rating from a 4 to a 3 star rating for the 2 months I had it for.;";0/"
47;25.0;1.0;18.0;"I thought the price of this compact little stair stepper might be too good to be true, and it certainly was.  Bought it in Feb 2014, and it broke by May 2014.\n\nMany other people have claimed it only lasts for a few months or so, and they're totally correct!  DO NOT waste your money; this is a piece of junk that WILL break on you in only a few months!\n\nWhen I first put it together and started using it, I loved how easily portable & lightweight it was.  It worked great for a little while, but it squeaked with every. single. step. and that was annoying, but we put some WD-40 on it and it helped quiet the squeaking, but only a little.\n\nBut then the entire cable that moves the steps up & down just snapped with no warning one day while I was on it.  This cable is crucial to the entire operation of the machine, and so now it's completely broken & worthless.\n\nIn the packaging that comes with the stair stepper, it says to only use the machine for about 10 minutes a day, which is fine if you're just beginning to work out, but I was needing something to give me a good long workout, so I was trying to use it for around 30 minutes each time, sometimes stopping after 15 minutes of use to let the thing ""rest"" before continuing.  This was, apparently, too much for it to take, and it broke.\n\nSo yes, while I did not follow the instructions to the letter, I'd also seen many other reviewers saying they used it for 20-40 minutes each time and it was doing just fine!  So I wonder if their machines are still working now?\n\nSo the point is, this is supposedly an EXERCISE machine that cannot let you EXERCISE on it for longer than 10 minutes or so! Like I said before; it's a cheap piece of junk.  Don't waste your money!\n\nOh, and the return policy is only good for 1 week after purchase.  I just looked it up because I tried to return it.  That's convenient!";"It's an ""exercise"" machine that you can't ""exercise"" on for longer than 10 minutes!"
6;26.0;1.0;7.0;"This worked well  with one very important exception: I could not get the handle to stay firmly in place.

25;27.0;5.0;11.0;You can't get any better than this.  It's sturdy, compact and does its job as good or better than one of those fancy stair steppers costing 10X what this did, $70.  I highly recommend it if you're just looking for a good leg/bottom workout. And for all the reviews saying it is difficult to assemble, my 12 yr old put mine together!;You can't get any better than this......
15;28.0;5.0;8.0;Totally love this stepper!  The hubby and I live in small townhouse so space is limited. I needed something that could fit in our coat closet for storage purposes and its perfect. It only took about 10-15 minutes to set up.  I set the stepper up right in front of my TV and put on a show that I need to catch up on Netflix and work out. I am an introvert and germophobe so I don't care for gyms so I thought this would be perfect to work out on especially it being winter time. I am unable to take my walks that I was taking during the spring and summer and those walks were keeping me in shape.  But since winter had arrived I knew I needed something and this was the answer.;Totally love this stepper
10;29.0;5.0;7.0;This definitely served its  purpose. Got a great cardio work out in (i included a kutting weight sauna shirt and 5 lbs weights for added calorie burn) it was easy to assemble took about 30 mins, very sturdy . In an 40 min workout i burned up to 540 calories according to my fitbit. just what i need when i wanna get a good sweat at home. Fits right in my room doesn't need alot of space;Worth the money
17;30.0;4.0;8.0;I was so excited when I got this stepper and surprised at its quality when it arrived. It took me just a few minutes to put it together and I liked that the handlebar was adjustable.  I actually thought it was a bit small and I couldn't imagine how a taller person would be able to use it comfortably.  I am 5-2 and felt cramped on it, but I needed something small so couldn't complain.\nit didn't take long for it to start squeaking, some times quite loudly even after lubing it, but it was still a great way to workout.  Unfortunately it took me more than 30 days to figure out that the intense pain I got in my poor flat feet was not going to get any better and I was lucky if I could go 10 minutes on it.  If you have fallen arches this one might not be a good choice for you and in my case arch supports only made it worse. I wish the stepper with the standard motion had a handlebar because I need it for balance and I think it would have hurt less than the twister.\nI finally gave up on it after six months and gave it to a friend. All that said, if you don't have any foot problems this one will kick your butt in a hurry and give you a great workout.\nI truly wish it could have worked for me.;Good little machine, but Not for those with flat feet
84;31.0;4.0;20.0;Arrived today and set up in short order.  So far, this feels right for my bilateral ankle conditions, I can keep balance and regulate the depth of my steps comfortably.\n\nI want to thank all the reviewers -- because of their comments, I was especially careful to tighten all the bolts properly and will continue to check that these are tight.\n\nAnd I put the Allen wrench and the instructions (with the bolt numbers, etc.) and the receipt in a baggie and twisted them in place safely on the machine.\n\nWill update if there are problems later.  Right now, big smiles. Price and free shipping, wonderful.;First Day's Review
59;32.0;1.0;17.0;Too bad Amazon doesn't allow you to upload photos, just videos.  I had such high hopes for this little machine. Upon arrival, the shipping box was great, no tears. I opened it to find the actual box containing the product was sound and sturdy and sealed tightly. That's where my satisfaction ended. As I cut opened the inside box containing the product I was dismayed to see something that had clearly been put together and taken apart all shoved inside the box in a haphazardly fashion. There were no directions and no way to figure out how to put the thing together--only parts shoved in a box. My daughter was going to put it together for me. A few moments later I heard her yelling and as I rushed to the kitchen I saw her standing there bleeding profusely from a gash on her hand. Upon closer inspection we realized the METAL base between the feet was actually SLICED--the metal was broken--not at a joint or crease, but on a flat part of the metal. There is only one way this item could be broken so severely and NOT damaged the box---and that is because someone ELSE damaged it and returned it and they just passed a long a broken piece of junk to me. Now I have a package weighing thirty to forty pounds with packaging that I have to manage to box up, retape shut and drive to somewhere to mail it back to amazon AND wait indefinitely for my merchandise credit. I think it's *nasty* to take a defective seriously broken item and just pass it along to another customer. My daughter could have been seriously hurt on this just taking it out of the box. I am livid over a product so cheap the metal actually splits in two  and the company doesn't even pay attention to their returns enough from the last person that returned it and passed along a dangerous and broken piece of junk to me. Can you say TETNUS shot time? All I wanted was a stepper. What I got was a broken piece of crap, inconvenience having to return it, and a daughter that has been hurt because of it.;Huge Expensive Disappointment

20;34.0;5.0;8.0;.  I am trying to build back my legs after surgery. Light enough to set in front of the TV so I use it a lot but can be moved into a corner when company comes.;Perfect for my needs
7;35.0;5.0;6.0;This stepper has a unique movement, which I feel is  better than the other similar steppers.  Because of other reviews I am gentle with the handle bars.  The package arrived in good condition, all parts were included and assembly was easy took 1/2 hour.;Great value on a unique stepper.
30;36.0;4.0;10.0;I loved this stepper before it broke. I had it only for a couple months....\nCheap product unfortunately! I cannot even return it because I am passed the returning period. It makes no sense. I don't weight over 200 pounds so I don't understand how come it broke. It is the second stepper from Sunny Twister that I buy that brakes.;I loved this stepper before it broke
65;37.0;1.0;16.0;The stepper worked fine until it broke after seven months of use.  The weld where the peddle is attached to the rest of the unit broke.  So unless you can weld or want to spend the time and money to find a welder it is unfixable.;Broke in 7 months.
22;38.0;5.0;8.0;For the price, this is really a good little investment. I bought it for my office so I could track my progress, jump on whenever I had a couple free minutes throughout the day, and then be able to tuck it away in a corner when I'm done. It is a lot better quality than I expected. I'm very happy with this little guy.;this is really a good little investment
13;39.0;5.0;6.0;"I purchased this about 2 months ago and use it almost daily. I haven't had any issues, bad parts, or problems with this like other reviews have stated. I LOVE this stepper. I have an adorable but small home, so I don't have room for big exercise machines. This thing is tiny, simple, and does the trick. Very light weight so I can easily move it from room to room. Love that it keeps time, calories, and so on. Takes AA batteries. Is quiet. Also love that you can change the resistance. My legs and thighs have gained muscle and my husband noticed that my ""backside"" (okay, my butt!) Has changed (for the better!). I've lost 15 pounds so far with this being the primary exercise that I use (along with diet changes). Can be used at a fast pace to get your heart rate up.";Simple, Small, Lightweight, Love It
23;40.0;5.0;8.0;Perfect low impact exercise for all ages.  My kids hop on all the time while they watch tv and get a good workout.  My parents (65 yrs old) tried it out and bought one as well.  You can adjust the tension which is a great option for all levels of users.  Would recommend for those people who need something compact, easy-to-use, and not super strenuous.;Perfect low impact exercise for all ages
85;41.0;4.0;16.0;My father experienced 4 massive strokes at the age of 56 in a week period and managed to live but it took his ability to walk or move his arms/hands. It's been a little over a year now and he has full function of his arms and hands once more, he can stand up and slowly walk so he is eventually getting back to normal. To help him I wanted to find something that would be affordable (I'm poor) and work, this seemed to be it and it made an awesome Christmas present for him. It's built very strong and its steady for the price. There is a concern of it falling forward but the way it's setup in his room on the wall makes it not an issue for us. It comes with a little tool to put it all together, I think from opening the box to having it setup took a little under 10 minutes. You do need some leg strength though to use this thing, so if you are in a similar position I would not buy this if they are barely able to stand up. The handle bar on this is actually a lot more sturdy then I thought it would be which made me happy due to the fact it's going to be used a lot by him. If you are looking to get a little more healthy and build some leg strength this will definitely do the job.;Purchased this for my father who is a stroke victim
4;42.0;4.0;5.0;I received this Friday and, after assembling it - which only took me about half an hour (I was on the phone), I have used it four times in the last five days - not counting Friday, when I used it a few times to test how it works.  I use it for an hour/day and begin sweating about half an hour into it.  I have it on the lightest setting and will be adjusting it up when I feel like it.  Right now it allows me to read, surf the net on my phone or carry on a conversation while on it.\n\nIt does make a small amount of noise but not enough to prevent me from enjoying television while on it.  Perhaps applying some oil on the wheel will help.  I'll update this if things change, but for the price, this is the best purchase I have made in a long time.;I'm working out at home!
35;43.0;5.0;9.0;"I have an original straight up-and-down pedal step movement mini stepper and it is ok, but i don't love it..lol\nBut this stepper with the down and slight outward , which is the 'twist', pedal step movement is so much easier on your hip and knee joints. It is a more fluid motion and I LOVE IT :) This stepper has a smoother motion than the regular mini stepper ...It is extremely quiet, compact, smooth, easy to do and fun :) Handle is perfect addition for stability also ;)  I love it so much i just bought my daughter one for Christmas :) AWESOME price with free shipping too! Thanx AMAZON :)";Love it :)
38;44.0;5.0;10.0;I ENJOY WORKING OUT WITH THIS.  I am in my early 50.\nThis may be known as Stepper but it does not involve real climbing like climbing the stairs, more like walking.\nI also have bad knee, usually I can't use staircases to climb up the stairs. I bought this machine to workout and keep fit. This stepper machine allow me to 'walk' in-house during bad weather, at my own comfort pace. Strength from the foot is used on this machine and not the knee. You can control the strength and speed you want. Basically you use your foot to control how fast you want. I use my foot to push half way down and up, so this way it is less strain on your legs. You use you foot and not your knee to workout. I have not get any single sore on my knee at all in fact trim your thigh. Beside, you can always control and stop at your own pace. This stepper has a counter so it allows you to watch how much you did and burn calories, let me to know how much calories I burnt on every exercise. I can do up to 1000 steps, and I lose 5 LBS within a month when I get this stepper. Now, I cannot part with this machine.;Five Stars
18;45.0;5.0;6.0;I've just put the Sunny stepper together without a hitch.  I love the way it feels with the ample sized steps and handle bars for sprint stepping.  It's sturdy and just the right price and size (getting cheaper by the minute).  I'm starting off slow and easy since it takes only a half a minute for me to get out of breath on it.  I bought this mainly so I can do low-impact exercises throughout the winter and in the heat of the summer.  What's even better is I can hide it in my closet when I want it out of sight.  A happy purchase.;Closet stepper
11;46.0;5.0;5.0;I have had this for about 2 months now. I have been using it 3-4 times a week and it definitely makes me sweat. It is definitely now the gym high tech stepper for for $60, it does a great job. For 20-30 minutes and an average of 250 -300 calories, I give it a 5 stars.\nI will definitely recommend its purchase.;Great for the price
12;47.0;5.0;5.0;I really enjoy working out with step machines. When I belonged to a gym, it was easy, but one of those machines cost $1000+ (not to mention, they are way to big for my home. After looking at reviews on this site and others I decided to order it.  It is exactly what I wanted.  It gives a great workout, and you can tighten or relax the tension.  It also has a little computer that shows your time, steps, etc.  I was afraid that it wouldn't be very stable, but I put a yoga mat under this on hardwood floor without a problem.;Great alternative for the gym/Stairmaster.  Good workout for your home!
51;48.0;5.0;11.0;The unit arrived yesterday.  It took about half an hour to put it together - not difficult at all.  Instructions are satisfactory.  It's better built than I thought it would be for the price, has a small footprint, and can be moved around easily.  My wife is used to the Stairmaster at the gym but they cost over $4000 and I was concerned that the Sunny Twister would not measure up.  We recently moved to a condo and the gym memberships at our new town cost more per month than this unit, so I thought I'd try one.  She used it today for the first time, and was quite pleased with its performance and the workout she received.  There are some reviews about the Sunny not holding up, but it seems very well made to me.  My wife is only about 100 lbs, so I think if you are a small person, it will last a long time.  Our initial impression is that it will suit us perfectly since my wife only went to the gym to use the Stairmaster, and this is a lot more convenient - and cheaper too.\n\nUpdate 6/3/14 - Still really like the unit.  No problems with it holding up with almost daily use for 30 min.  Very glad we bought it.\nUpdate 3/7/15 - Working fine in spite of being used 4 or 5 times a week.;Better than expected
40;49.0;1.0;9.0;FRUSTRATED. We knew just by looking at quality of the packaging that this thing was opened and used by someone before us.  That would of been just fine except that nine out of fourteen parts (screws and misc items) needed to put this thing together was missing. That still would have been fine if I was ordering it for myself, but it was a gift for my mom.;That would of been just fine except that nine out of fourteen parts (screws and ...
56;50.0;1.0;11.0;I order this product hoping to burn some fat but it came with a part missing.  After speaking to Amazon's customer service (who by the way were awesome!), I got a new machine except the same part was missing!  I had to return it again.  I just got my refund.  I wasn't about to try for the third time!!!  So I give it a one out of five star because the manufacture doesn't even check to be sure if all the parts are included.;Did even get to try it out
45;51.0;2.0;9.0;The way the steps slightly move outward as you step down force you into a weird stepping motion. Ultimately the motions hurt my knees. It's not a natural motion as if I were to walk up stairs. It's like walking up stairs and sliding slightly outward with each step up, putting and unnatural pressure on my knees. I eventually stopped using this shortly after I got it. I have no use for it because it's not beneficial. Disappointing product. Would not recommend.;It's like walking up stairs and sliding slightly outward with each ...

76;53.0;4.0;12.0;I've only had it a week, so my opinion may change with longer usage. This was easy to assemble, and is lightweight but doesn't feel unsafe or rickety. It does exactly what I need and I get a decent workout. The computer on it is kind of a joke, you can't adjust any settings for age/weight/etc. I have noticed that it squeaks, as other reviewers have mentioned. It's a little annoying, and it's not a consistent noise. I haven't noticed it overheating and I've checked after a 45 min workout. Overall, I'm pleased with this stepper.\n\n4/30/12 UPDATE: This squeaks louder than ever, and all the time now, after a week of regular use. I tried silcone lubricant and it worked for a couple minutes. I contacted the manufacturer today and they got back to me within a couple of hours and suggested WD-40. They said if it didn't work they'd send new hydraulics to me asap. The WD-40 improved the volume of the squeak, but it's still there. I'm going to try it for another day and then I'll ask for a replacement part from Sunny. I'm still pleased with how the product functions and the manufacturer has been great so far about dealing with the issue.;Good value for price
69;54.0;5.0;11.0;"I wasn't expecting a whole lot for the small price, and the box was pretty light when I brought it in from the porch. But after my husband put it together (in under 30 minutes), I stepped onto it and absolutely fell in love! This thing is very well-made and solidly built (I still can't believe that it doesn't weigh very much.) I began using it and after about a week, began to feel better, my knee that used to hurt no longer hurts, my leg muscles are much stronger and I am not out of breath after walking long distances or up hill. Best $72 I ever spent for my health! I love the Sunny Twister and highly recommend it. I am in my early 60s and fairly sedentary. This is just what I needed. The handle bar is great, but I don't hold onto it for dear life; it is just there for balancing. And it is honing my ability to balance better (older folks have a problem with that), when I just lightly hold onto the handle. I am 5'5"" and weigh 150. It is the perfect size for me. A very, very heavy person might not get much out of this, though. But for me, it is perfect.";Wow! Great, solid, little machine!
24;55.0;5.0;6.0;Best stepper that I have used. It is low impact and that is what I need because my joints ache. I have been able to loose weight with this product. And it was very easy for me to assemble. I have very limited space in my home, so this workout equipment works great for me. And the shipping was surprisingly fast. Also it is very affordable. I would not recommend it to someone that is extremely overweight however. My friend ordered it as well, but she was too heavy for it and it broke. And I do not mean that comment ugly or disrespectful at all. I am heavy myself so I was afraid I would break it. But surprisingly it didn't break with me.;Best workout equipement that i own
19;56.0;5.0;5.0;Compact and well constructed.  I have receive mine a few days a go.  Easy to assemble, my husband had it in one piece in just few minutes.  I had my first set of exercise, and believe me it do what is suppose to do.  Great value, I recommend !;Great Value !
42;57.0;1.0;8.0;You get what you pay for. There is no tension setting for the stepping. The range of motion for the step seems too small too, like tiny little steps. I don't feel like it truly works the muscle groups it should for a true stepping motion.\nThe handle bar became loose and wobbly very easily after even little use. It is a very basic unit.;like tiny little steps
28;58.0;5.0;6.0;This is a great compact stair stepper! We were looking for something that was small enough to fit in our room without taking up too much space but not super cheap in quality. This one is great! It fits nicely in the corner area behind our closet door so its perfect! It has a knob to adjust the tension. So you cant just hit a button up or down to adjust but I simply set it before getting on. I prefer the highest setting so its perfect. The handle bars adjust tall enough for my husband and short enough to where even my little guy (5) can get on and use it if he wanted! That is a simple knob adjustment also. There is a small counter to record your steps and time. It will hold the numbers til your next session or you can hold the button to reset and begin again.\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this.. which is really very minor, is that the bolts at the base of the hand bar work loose very easily. But its nothing a little lock tight couldn't fix!\nOverall this is an excellent buy for the money!;Great compact stepper!
79;59.0;5.0;11.0;Great little machine so far...granted i only just put it together and did about 200 steps but already i can feel the burn in my legs. Sooooo...easy to put together, and i never put anything together thats usually left for my husband to do. Took me about half and hour and most of that time spent was threading the computer wires through the tubes. Seems to made really sturdy. So unless it falls apart after a few uses i am one happy camper with this purchase!!!!;awesome little machine
21;60.0;4.0;5.0;It has a very sturdy build quality. From what i can tell it can hold up to a decent amount of weight. It has a decent system for adjusting height and tension. And over all as a workout. Its works. Its not quite as physically demanding as running up a bunch of steps. But its definitely more of a workout then walking or jogging. Harder workout then a treadmill. But not so hard that a person bew to working out cant jump on it and go for a little while. Basically i would recommend this to anyone whose not a serious fitness buff. Because they could find something thats a much harder workout. But if you just want an inexpensive peice of equipment you can jumo on and get a decent workout in the morning or afternoon then this is for you.;For the price you cant ask for much more
31;61.0;1.0;6.0;For some reason my stepper does not count calories. It counts time to 4 seconds, then stops counting anything. I'm not sure what is wrong with it;For some reason my stepper does not count calories. ...
63;62.0;1.0;9.0;I was disappointed with this product overall.  It doesn't offer a very good cardio workout due to the short stride.  After only two months of use the bottom bar is broken.  It isn't worth the price.  You are better off to look for an elliptical.;Broken with 2 months
78;63.0;4.0;10.0;Nice machine.  Good exercise, but it takes a bit to work up to the 10 minutes they recommend.  Tension can be adjusted but for this senior there is no really easy stepping.  Have not figured out the twisting part.  Fairly light weight and can be moved into another room without much effort.;step machine
50;64.0;5.0;8.0;I received this device about one month ago. This is the first stepper device I have ever used. I really like this device. Assembly was simple - just follow instructions carefully. All of the hardware is installed where it will be going after assembly, so you have to remove the bolts from the frame so there is no little bag of nuts & bolts. There is a bag containing batteries, computer cable, cable fishing device, and an allen wrench The only hardware item that is not installed to it's final location on the frame is the tension adjustment knob. That is in the styrofoam piece with the computer. Assembly requires only an allen wrench which is included. I used a small piece of tape when installing the computer cable as the wire kept sliding back in to the lower tube when I was trying to install it on the machine. This is the only thing that is missing from the instructions which would make assembly even easier. When you pull the computer cable through one of the tubes in the handle shaft simply tape it off at the top of the tube until you get the tube installed. They even include an item (cable fishing device) to make getting the computer cable from the step count sensor in the base of the device up through the handle shaft to the computer very simple! I believe this device design and packaging was very well thought out. You will probably be surprised when you see how small the shipping package is. Don't let this concern you because it is small because of the way the parts are placed inside. I bought this device to help with my diabetes. I cannot walk for exercise and am out of shape. I needed a low-impact exercise like stepping. I could barely do 30 seconds on this thing initially. After using it fairly regularly for a 3 - 4 weeks I am up to 30 minutes a day and can see the decrease in my blood sugar and my physical stamina has increased. My goal is to do 60 minutes per day. I weighed ~ 240 lbs which is 10 lbs under the weight limit for this device of 250 lbs. I did read in one review about a guy who weighed 320 lbs and had no problems until after six months. At six month a weld broke. Considering he was 70 lbs over the weight limit for the device I am impressed. I myself now weigh 220 lbs. Weight loss was due to both exercise and a healthier diet. I Bought this particular stepper primarily because of the low price. I wasn't sure if I would actually be able to use one of these steppers and I don't need an $800 towel rack. This device has a very small footprint and is not too heavy to move before & after exercising with it. I keep mine in my bedroom which is only 10 x 10 and contains a queen size bed, a night stand, two bureaus, and an armoire. The bedroom was tight before I bought his device and I thought I would have to keep it outside the bedroom, but, it fits in nicely. I simply move it out of the corner and put it in front of the TV to watch while stepping and move it back when done. The small computer on this device is a big help. It keeps track of time and counts (# steps). I don't believe the calorie count that is reported is correct. It seems low when compared to some formulas I found on line for stepper exercise. I am not sure how much use I will get out of this thing before it breaks, but, I think it looks reasonably heavy-duty especially for a cost of $63.99 including shipping! I was very skeptical about the device's robustness at that price  I was very pleased when I opened the shipping carton up and got a first hand look at the quality of the device. It looks reasonably robust which actually surprised me. I see no reason why this device shouldn't last me quite some time. I have not tried varying the resistance so I cannot comment on that - I am using it with minimal resistance and that is enough for me. I initially purchased this device for evaluation thinking that if I actually used it then I could buy a more expensive one. Now after using this device for a while I don't believe I will need to do that. I believe I should be able to use this device 30-60 minutes every other day for years as long as the device is lubricated regularly. I have not heard the funny noises that a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, but, most of them seemed to be using the device for a longer time than I do in each session. If you are looking for a medium duty stepper that is inexpensive with a simple computer then this device is ideal! I cannot imagine getting a better deal for the money!  This is the first review I have ever written for a product purchased online. I wrote it because I wanted to help people out who are considering purchasing one of these. Do it - you will not be disappointed! That is if you actually use it and don't turn it into a towel or clothing rack. Either way for the cost of $65 including shipping it is worth the risk and I hope this review helped. Happy stepping.;Sunny Twister Stepper with Handle Bar - great deal for the money!
44;65.0;1.0;7.0;Only lasted 2-3 month, used by a 140lbs person. Weld completely broke off.\n\nPlease do NOT buy.;One Star
26;66.0;5.0;5.0;I'll be honest, I felt like I stepped into 1987 when I bought this. But I was looking for a small workout machine I could keep in my bedroom that would work out my butt and legs when I can't get to the gym. This machine does the trick. The resistance is not adjustable, but so far that hasn't been an issue. After 20 minutes, I am huffing and puffing and my legs are BURNING. For the price, its a great little contraption. I like gyms' rotating stairs, and although this doesn't compare, it still gives a decent workout. You can change up the way you use it by moving your feet from the front to the back or by using your tippy toes vs flat feet.;Decent workout
0;67.0;1.0;10.0;I purchased this Sunny Stepper, and I wanted something I could exercise at home. But when I started using it, I felt so uncomfortable on the machine. My knees were touching each other as I was running and I could not take even half steps. In other words it was annoying to use it. So thanks to AMAZON they took it back with no charge to the buyer!!!!;The price is too high for the quality
37;68.0;5.0;6.0;"This thing is awesome! Mine gets used daily, and after about two years just squeaks a bit. It has been through multiple moves (due to us being military, and I bring it on trips when I can!) and is just SO easy! I have many many machines. All very expensive, and nice, but use this the most. It is small and compact enough to leave out in our living room and not be intrusive on everyone. The price is unbeatable, and for those saying it breaks after a couple months who are very heavy people...you would need commercial equipment to handle that type of weight for long periods of time. But for the price, even replacing it every couple months to get your results would be worth it. As a female at 5'4"" and 130 lbs finishing working off the baby weight from #4, it has stood the test of time and moves beyond expectations. I actually came on to get one as a gift :)\n\nUpdated...going on five years with this, and I have no idea how people are breaking this so easily. It is a perfect little simple machine with so many benefits. Despite knee surgeries, a lifelong bad back,and blood clots in my legs, this is a God send. Even my kids and husband jump on it. My little toddler already tries stepping!";Great little workhorse!
27;69.0;4.0;5.0;First stepper had one of the hydro live break after a week. Amazon replaced it for free however and it has been fine for the past month.;Ok for the money (~$60)
29;70.0;5.0;5.0;My last Stepper broke and this one is a replacement for it.  I love this item and use it every day.  I have limited space in a small apartment, so this fits great.;This Is A Great Item.
32;71.0;5.0;5.0;Doesn't take up much room.  put it in front of the tv and get a great work out!  I came back from a terrible illness.  I could hardly walk I started working out a little at a time... After 3 months  Im walking up stairs It made a huge difference in rebuilding my knees hips and legs.;So glad I ordered this
41;72.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased both - handle bar and no handle bar.  The handle bar is suitable for people with balancing problem.  The one without allows me to do rubber band stretching exercises.\n\nIf you have knee and ankle problems like me, you can step half way or twist to reduce stress on knees.  (just playing with it)  Another way to reduce stress on knees is to step, rest, step.  The hudraulic shock absorber won't kick in action until you increased the steps per second rate.\n\nWell design of both exercise machine.  Thanks to the designig team.;If you have knee and ankle problems like me, you can step half way or twist ...
70;73.0;4.0;8.0;I'm pretty lazy when it comes to working out...it's boring, I admit that.  I bought a bike and I can do that while zoning out to some music, but I let my parents use it.  I have extremely limited space so I needed either another tiny bike or something like this because I wanted a treadmill or an elliptical ...or a bike.\n\nIt was pretty simple to put together but pay attention if you are not the type to assemble things because the pieces weren't necessarily put in the box the way the directions were instructing.  I like putting together workout equipment though... it's my favorite part of buying the stuff...and a workout in itself...\n\nThis is tough on the legs if you don't do much movement (which I don't) my goodness.  You have to adjust the tension of course.  I've only had this for a couple of weeks and truthfully right now I can do about five minutes then I have to do something else.  I do have joint problems though and it's not because I'm lazy that's because of chocolate and my inability to not eat it...\n\n  anyway it can be wobbly and again if you don't adjust it you'll be done in under ten minutes be wise on this purchase... I like it but if you're larger than me... you may want to reconsider.  I'm  around 5'3 and I wear a size 8 shoe in women's...and I'm over 180... I got my dad to try it out and he's a pretty tall semi big dude, his feet looked awkward he wears a size 12 and I was scared he was going to fall, he's over 70...and has bad knees...so it's not for the unstable. like I said be wise as to whether this product will fit your size and your body mass...overall I'd say give it a try for the price and the size I'm guessing it can't be too hard to return this if it doesn't work out...;So far it seems to do what it does...
53;74.0;5.0;7.0;It took me less than a half an hour to put this machine together.  Really easy instructions and so simple without any outside tools needed and I am NOT mechanically inclined.  The handlebar is great but remember to tighten the screws at the base again after you use it the first few times as it will get kind of loose with the first use. The size is perfect as it is very small and fits into my small loft easily without sticking out into the living area. I work out regularly and bought this to increase the intensity of my jogging in place in side my house. I jog for 10 minutes and then do the stepper for 5 as an interval program. Even though I am in good shape, the stepper really gets my heart rate going before I go back to jogging for another ten minutes. I work out for about an hour alternating between the stepper and jogging.  You can feel your muscles working right away not only in your legs but surprising for me also in your abs.  You may not get a totally accurate calorie count on the monitor since you do not enter your weight or age but it is close enough. I debated between this small machine and the much more expensive larger Boxflex Treadclimber. This machine may not last as long or have all the bells and whistles of the other machine but it does the job and for the price if it breaks after a year or two I will just buy another.  I love it!;So Far... Great
72;75.0;5.0;8.0;This stepper was easy to assemble. If your mechanical at all you will follow your intuition and the pictures and have it up and ready to use in 20 minutes. It's sturdy, the handlebars are cushioned, there is plenty of surface area in the foot peddles. It's easy to use, just work into it a few minutes at a time adding in minutes as the days & weeks go by. You can workout till aerobic or just take a stroll it's up to you.\nI have mine in front of our three story picture windows looking out over Sedona.  I feel like I'm walking right into the landscape without getting sunburn or frostbite.;Works for me!
58;76.0;5.0;7.0;I purchased this 7 months ago, it was extremely easy to assemble. I have used it almost daily for seven months, it still works great. After 2 months it did develop a slight squeaking noise, which I was able to fix right away with WD40. Had had no problems with it, very light weight and small. Great purchase,;Great purchase,
81;77.0;5.0;8.0;So far I am pleased with this little stepper, it does make some noise more like an airy sound rather than a squeak after you've put in at least 15 minutes on it. As far as the workout intensity it is what you make it, I like to pump my arms or add free weights and do some air punches while stepping. I use it everyday when I first wake up just to get my heart pumping and wake myself up and on those days that it is not fit to run outdoors or I don't feel like being bothered in the gym this machine does a fine job at helping bust a sweat. Set-up was pretty simple and straight forward it took about 15 minutes total. I will say that this machine is the perfect size for someone short like myself I am 5'1 and the bars are at the perfect height for me, but someone taller may find it rather small or too low for their comfort.;Great value
61;78.0;1.0;7.0;"If you read below, we loved this little machine BUT - it lasted a whole 9 months before the welds that hold the foot pedal pivot points broke on both sides.\n\nContact with Sunny Fitness resulted in my being told: ""We have a 90 day warranty which covers any defective or damaged parts, as well as shipping & handling; however, this item is out of warranty""  Item was purchased here on Amazon\non May 28, 2013 and received on May 31, 2013.\n\nI advised Sunny Fitness that I felt this is a true ""manufacturers defect"" and given they would not stand behind this product, I was going to amend my review.\n\nPS - my wife and I are NOT obese.\n\nSorry - but DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCE\n\nOriginal Review from June 2013\n\nThis little machine will kick your butt (literally). Use your own power and resistance.\n\nSturdy, takes up no space, and really get's your heart started.\n\nGreat little machine and great value when compared with what you would spend on a powered stepper that, by the way,\ngives you no more of a workout than this one does.";DO NOT BUY - Sorry to have to change my review
39;79.0;1.0;5.0;This is a second time that I ordered this product. First stepper broke after 6 months so I just ordered another one but to my surprise, this one broke after only 2.5 months. This can't be a coincidence. Both steppers broke in the exact same spot. Very unhappy with this situation. Please think twice before purchasing this product. I certainly don't recommend it.;I certainly don't recommend it.
54;80.0;5.0;6.0;I use the stepper while I am watching T.V. It is small enough to leave out and hop on anytime.;I love it.
43;81.0;4.0;5.0;"Have only had this for about a week and a half, so I can't speak to it's longevity, but I am very happy so far!  After using the Sunny Twister Stepper a few times; I decided that I needed to tighten up some areas with the allen wrench provided, but, beyond that, it has really impressed me (and now feels very sturdy)!  I know that I'm getting a great workout.  I have used it for 45 minutes every other day and think this little guy is a STEAL when compared to my now expired gym membership.  Working out for me is not a social activity; it's honestly just a necessary evil to get rid of the extra pounds and flab!  This is going to do it.  I'm 44yrs old and have yo-yo'd for years, so I know what works.  The assembly was easy, it is light enough to move easily, the stepping mechanism is smooth (with the occasional squeak) and the timer is far better than I anticipated!  Love it!  Buy it!  **Also, I have a bad knee and this machine only aggravates it a tiny bit, much less than walking or running**";Beats a Gym Membership!
55;82.0;5.0;6.0;It arrived quickly. It was easy to put together. It takes up a very small amount of room. It's sturdy and has so far held up to everyday use. I would recommend this to beginners as well as the advanced because of the adjustable resistance. The best part was the price!!!!;Above my expectations
46;83.0;5.0;5.0;Super easy to assemble, took me 15 minutes.  It is very quiet so I can watch TV and use it.  I have the tension set at a medium level and in 3 minutes I could feel the workout on my legs.  It is compact and fits in my little one room log cabin with no problems.  I would recommend this exercise machine to anyone that would like a small, quiet, efficient piece of workout equipment.;Super easy to assemble
67;84.0;5.0;6.0;The stepper came the day after I ordered it.  I was immediately afraid to open and see how hard it would be to put together.  Imagine my surprise when it was almost ready except for handle and computer.  Did I mention I'm near 70?  This went together smoothly and I was using in 45 minutes.  For the price, I thought it would be cheaply made but no it is sturdy enough to hold me (over 200 lbs.) and not even move around.  I will tell you that you can get a real workout if you have not been working out for a while.  It is small enough for me to move around and also hide when not in use. Would be great for apartments. I was looking at more expensive models and this is better, easier, smaller, cheaper.  Did I also say how quiet it is?  I can watch tv or listen to radio and not even a squeak as I work out.  The computer does time, calories, amount of steps.  Love it and would ask people just starting out to try this first.;Perfect exercise
48;85.0;1.0;5.0;I ordered this based on the reviews other people posted.\nI'm in good shape, so that might be the issue.  If you're out of shape then this might do wonders for you, but I used it for an hour and felt NOTHING.  Thank goodness I was watching Breaking Bad while doing it or it would have been a total waste of time.\nNot to mention- when it arrived it was damaged.  You have to assemble it yourself and the metal was literally bent even though it was brand new.  Before I could put it together I had to use my own pliers to bend the metal in a way so that I could assemble it.  I think it's worthless and wish I never bought it.  When I go to the gym I spend 5-10 minutes on other machines (elliptical, etc.) and my legs feel like they're getting a workout.  I felt like I had marched in place for an hour.  Don't waste your money.;Worthless
74;86.0;2.0;6.0;"I loved using this product for the first two years or so.\nIt sat in my living room for a good year before I actually started to use it.\nIt was extremely simple to set up and use; however, once I started using it regularly, I noticed quite a few flaws.\nThe first flaw would be the weakness of the bottom screws holding the the handles up: they loosened quickly and I had to screw them back into place multiple times.\nThe second flaw is the squeaking the machine makes--it takes quite a few steps to get it warmed up.\nThe third flaw is the weakness of the bolts giving to us to secure the metal cord--the one that makes the wheel turn to move the steps. It snapped like a twig after several uses.\nThe fourth flaw is the most disappointing: the machine started to tear. Yes, the metal parts that were welded together, at the bottom of the machine holding the steps to the body, started to break at the seams.\nI am now left with a semi-ripped machine. It is extremely disappointing.";Disappointing
83;87.0;3.0;6.0;Product is fine.  Not crazy about the twister action but may be effective in building stronger hips.  Not good if you have a hip joint problem.;Twister Stepper
62;88.0;4.0;5.0;Bought this stair stepper two years ago and the frame cracked. Looked around and could not find a better deal for the price. My wife used it every day for that two years. So, we bought another one.;Only lthing available.
82;89.0;5.0;5.0;The shipping was fast on this item.  I had recently bought a treadmill and I wanted something else for my legs.  I am very pleased with it. It takes up very little space.  Buy it and you will love it.  It was very simple to put together.;Love it.
89;90.0;5.0;5.0;Yes,,it was a very good pick,,i am so glad i choose this one,,not straining on my spine,,you work out at your own pace,stop when you need to,,and the price was right,,and also takes up very little room,,thank you Sunny;Steppin out in style

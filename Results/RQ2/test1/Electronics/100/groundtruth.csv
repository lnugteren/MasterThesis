35;1.0;5.0;629.0;"If this is your first foray into high-end audio, you're listening at home, and you can afford a decent amplifier, buy these cans before you splurge for any others.\n\nLet me first attempt to burnish my credibility. I've had my HD600s for a few months. I'm not Steve Guttenberg and I haven't heard every system on earth. I have installed a number of 4-figure 7.1 systems, designed and installed my own room correction, and annoyed the Magnolia people at Best Buy by spending way too long running my own demo material through 5-figure Martin Logan electrostats. Also, I didn't spend my youth at KISS concerts, so at least for now, I'm not deaf.\n\nSome cans I've owned or still own:\n\nGrado SR80 (open, dynamic, $100)\nSony MDR-7506 (closed, dynamic, $100)\nOppo PM3 (closed, orthodynamic, $400)\nHifiman 400i (open, orthodynamic, $500)\n\nI compared all of them back to back with these HD600s for many hours through a huge variety of well-recorded material, in all cases with an O2/ODAC. This latter component has ruler-flat response and zero audible distortion; I'm not messing with the output with anything that might favor one can at the expense of another.\n\nMy short take: start with these HD600s. Mixing, pleasure listening, whatever; if your environment allows for open cans, start here. Nothing cheaper is a more complete product in aggregate. You can spend more and get improvements in some areas, but almost always with commensurate disadvantages elsewhere. Plenty of folks with $1500 HD800s keep their HD600s anyway for when they tire of the pointed treble of that otherwise stellar can. Orthodynamics and electrostats can top them in the midrange and highs, but often lose on bass impact.\n\nStart with the HD600s so you can find out what you like. Because it's been around for 20 years as an audiophile benchmark that everyone's heard, you can find endless measurements and comparisons. A sentence that starts with, ""I like my HD600s except for ..."" is likely to bear more fruit than any other reference.\n\nThat in mind, let's talk about how they're designed and how they compare with the others above.\n\nOPEN VS. CLOSED:\n\nHeadphones are just small speakers. With any speaker, you only want to hear one side. The other side makes the same noise at the same volume, but reversed in polarity. If you could magically direct both sides at each other, they'd cancel out. (This is incidentally why it's important not to wire a channel backwards in your home stereo: weird frequency nulls ensue. Desirable nulls, perhaps, if you're inverting a mic feed to make noise-canceling cans.) We therefore need to do something with the flipped signal so it won't pollute the primary.\n\nClosed cans (and conventional box speakers) cover the back of the driver with baffling material to absorb the sound energy. While this approach doesn't want for accuracy or frequency response, it does tend to make the listening space sound smaller. Open headphones (and ""infinite baffle"" speakers) solve the baffling problem by not solving it; they just vent the back of the speaker into a huge space. Great for acoustics (no need to account for backpressure and the like), but at the cost of treating the missionary one seat over to your collection of Eazy-E.\n\nSennheiser assumes you're listening at home with this can, so they've opted for an open design.\n\nBUILD:\n\nThese are not fashion or luxury headphones. The're light and plasticky with a marbled gloss finish that must have been avant garde in 1998. While I've heard good things about the long-term durability of the ear pads, overall quality (box included) seems little better than the pair of HyperX cans I just bought for $60. That middling impression was reinforced a few weeks after purchase when I started getting intermittent cutouts in one channel.\n\nSennheiser supposedly solved this problem eons ago. Their warranty department was responsive, but wanted me to send back the old cable before they'd ship me a new one. (Counterpoint: Logitech's repeatedly sent me replacement Anywhere MX mice with little more than a request and a serial number.) That wasn't worth the hassle. I bought an aftermarket version on the big auction site for $15 that's been reliable for months.\n\nSOUND AND COMFORT:\n\nComfort is excellent. I have a big head and big ears. There's a lot of compression and I had to stretch the band a bit. After that, low weight and plush cups that actually fit around my ears make them easy to forget. The SR80 are on-ear and uncomfortable, the PM3 are on-ear (for me) and very uncomfortable, the 7506 are on-ear and equally comfortable (because they have no clamping pressure), and the 400i are over-ear and equally comfortable.\n\nTreble is very good. Clean, not strident, and neutral or very slightly forward. On par or better than the 400i for most material. The PM3 is noticeably recessed, but otherwise excellent. The 7506 has a somewhat forward mix with at least one frequency peak that can make it sound thin. The SR80 is quite sharp and tiring with trumpets, violins, and so on. This same treble overemphasis can add life to otherwise dull recordings.\n\nMidrange is excellent. The 7506 sounds fairly good, but a bit ""fake"" and radio-ish back-to-back with the others. The SR80 has a large emphasis here suited to solo vocals, but becomes fatiguing quickly on any recording with more than a few things going on, particularly modern rock or pop. The 400i is stellar. The PM3 is almost as stellar, though ever-so-slightly colored. The HD600 has a very subtle, pleasing coloration I didn't catch until I equalized it. Detail resolution is slightly behind the orthos.\n\nBass is very good. Both orthos play a little deeper and with better definition, but lack the HD600's ""punch."" The 7506 is decent here, though not terribly precise. The SR-80 might as well not have bass at all. There's a definite argument for the PM3; I might even prefer that one because, like all good orthos and unlike conventional dynamics, there's less distortion at low frequencies. Very pure, distinct tones.\n\nMy best description of the HD600 is ""euphonic."" There's nothing wrong with the sound. It doesn't sparkle or pound or whatever wine-review description accompanies cans that try too hard. It's the kind of sound that makes you wonder where the last three hours went, the kind that can make some pieces sound almost distressingly beautiful.\n\nFILES AND DACS:\n\nYou can't talk about an output device without a parallel discussion of the signal chain. That includes your audio file, a DAC, and an amp.\n\nThe importance of file format is overrated. No one's ever been able to reliably tell the difference between 44 KHz / 16-bit CD ""Redbook"" audio and any ostensibly better (e.g., SACD, DVD-A) digital format. Surround sound or the limited dynamic range of analog records might be pleasing to some folks, but for pure 2-channel listening, there's no point chasing anything better than a CD.\n\nIn fact, even lossy compression may suffice. Much of the vitriol directed at lossy file formats stems from bad encoders. If you converted your CDs to low-bitrate MP3 with whatever terrible encoder we had fifteen years ago (et tu, Xing?), you'll probably catch some noises you won't like in some material (e.g., a subtle warble in the ring of a cymbal). But modern 256 Kb/s AAC (Apple's preferred format) or 320 Kb/s MP3 encoded in the last five years? The confluence of factors necessary to be able to distinguish it from the original source (trained listener, good hearing, great gear, isolated sound, repeated listening, looking for that specific flaw) is so rare as to be irrelevant.\n\nDACs (digital to analog converters) take your MP3, FLAC, MP4, or whatever digital source and transform it to an analog signal that can be amplified. They're not that complicated; this conversion is very much a solved problem. Or would be if not for the lack of a line-out to skip the amplifier stage in most audio devices, the tendency to bury the poor DAC among other noisy components (read: every motherboard ever), or design priorities that favor subjective impressions over measurements (defensible with an amp, less a DAC). Still, the audible difference between a mediocre DAC and an average one is modest, and between average and great, only slight. If you want a standalone DAC anyway, consider jumping straight to the $125 price range for an ODAC or JDS OL DAC. Both measure well enough never to need upgrading.\n\nAMPS:\n\nAmps have one chief purpose: make the cans play loud enough. Your laptop, phone, iPod, and sound card all have amps already. Whether any particular amp/headphone combination plays loud depends on the sensitivity (dB/mW) of the headphones, their ""ohm"" rating (their input impedance; the electrical equivalent of backpressure), and how much power the amp can output at that ohm rating. Cans with low impedance (< 50 ohms) and high sensitivity (100+ dB/mW) are easy to drive. You can push them to deafening volumes from most any device. Higher impedance cans like the HD600, not so much. They need more power. They need an external amp, whether portable and battery-powered or a metal box at home.\n\nJust for kicks, let's do some math to prove the point. Loudness is all about decibels. Deafening is 120 dB, loud is 90 dB, and libraries are 40 dB. On this scale, things sound twice as loud every +10 dB, but every +3 dB needs double the power. You probably want to be able to hit at least 110 dB for transients. Maybe 115 dB if you don't like your spouse and never want to hear them again.\n\nThe iPhone 6 has pretty typical power output for a portable:\n\nDriving 15 ohms: 45 mW\nDriving 30 ohms: 25 mW\nDriving 300 ohms: 3 mW\n\nThe scale is linear: cut the ohm load in half and (in physics land with spherical cows and amps that don't run out of current or voltage) you double the wattage. These HD600s are 300ish ohms with sensitivity around 97 dB/mW. The iPhone manages 3 mW for a load like this, so we're looking at maybe 101 dB max. Weak sauce, particularly since that's the loudest possible volume and the average volume for most recordings (that aren't Metallica) will be quite a lot lower. (If you raise the average levels with a maxed-out amp, the peaks won't get any louder, but they will clip and distort.) Compare Oppo's PM3: that one does 101 dB/mW with impedance around 30 ohms. With 25 mW from the iPhone, we end up at 115 dB; much more potent. You'd need 63 mW at 300 ohms (about 25 times as much power) to get the same volume from the HD600. (See my comment on 7/12/17 for the calculations.)\n\nAfter power, the amp's next challenge is to not ruin frequency response. That's hard for one big reason: the impedance of dynamic headphones (all of them unless labeled orthodynamic or electrostatic) changes with frequency. It might be 200 ohms at this frequency and 400 ohms at another. If the amp's output impedance is zero, this shift in headphone impedance doesn't matter. If it's more than zero, the voltage sent to the cans (and by implication how loud they are at that frequency) will change over the frequency range. Whatever response curve Sennheiser had in mind (""Ve shall haf 14% less zeebilance""), high output impedance can result in something very different. This is why it's hard to take subjective opinions seriously if you don't know how the headphones were driven.\n\nThere's another benefit to low output impedance: better bass control. Speakers tend to get sloppy and distort at frequencies near their resonance peaks. That manifests as a muddy, definition-smothering bass hump. The best way to prevent this distortion (assuming you want to; some people actually like it) is with electrical damping, the ability of the amp to electrically resist unwanted movement (much like it's hard to spin a motor if you've shorted the power terminals). To keep bass distortion and frequency response changes inaudible, the amp's impedance needs to be, if not zero, at least 8 times less than the headphone impedance. A few inexpensive devices manage this 'damping factor' of 8 with just about every can (e.g., the original Sansa Clip+ that measures 1 ohm), though not many (the various iPhones tend to be 5-10 ohms).\n\nEverything else about amps starts to get subjective. To me, a perfect amp has zero distortion. To the folks buying tube amps, distortion is the whole point. Same thing with deviations to the frequency response curve; best-case, it's flat over the entire range, but if your headphones have a V-shaped response curve to boost bass and treble, an amp that rolls both ends will make them an easier listen over the long term. Many tube amps attenuate the high end; since the classic ""audiophile"" curve has strong treble to emphasize detail, softening that treble peak quite often sounds better.\n\nAnyway, long story short, if the open design of these HD600s didn't already to consign them to home use, their high impedance probably will unless you want to supplement your traveling kit with something like a Fiio E07K. Schitt's Magni and JDS's Objective2 and EL Amp are all very strong choices for a setup tethered to an outlet.\n\nCABLES:\n\nThey don't matter. Buy whatever you want.\n\nThe only electrical characteristic we care about is impedance. Thicker cables have less, thinner cables have more. Provided the combined impedance of the amp and the cable doesn't result in a damping factor below 8, it doesnt matter if the cable can tow a boat or floats in a breeze. An improvement in impedance you cant hear isn't an improvement.\n\nLet's evaluate the stock HD600 cable, a 9-foot pair of skinny 30ish-gauge wires Sennheiser hasn't touched in twenty years. For that length and gauge, we can calculate an impedance of about 0.8 ohms, barely a rounding error relative to the 300+ ohm impedance of the headphones. A typical 10-ohm amp paired with the HD600s has a damping factor of 30. Add the cable and it's 300/10.8, or 28. The difference in sound wouldn't even be measurable.\n\nOutput volume is likewise unchanged. The power reaching the drivers is 300/300.8, or about 99.7%. Itd take a 20% loss to drop the volume by a single decibel. Run the same weedy cable to a 4-ohm living room speaker and youd lose 17% of the amp's power and reduce the collective damping factor to 5, best case. In a room bedecked with acoustic panels, you might just detect a loss in fidelity. In an untreated room, the cable would be the least of your worries.\n\nBetter cables do tend to have more durable interconnects, though they won't sound better unless the old ones were corroded. Neither will balanced cables. Their claim to fame is a reduction in channel crosstalk, but that benefit is marginal for high-impedance cans and further obscured by the even stereo mix of most material.\n\nHD600 vs. HD650:\n\nThe HD600 is one of the most neutral headphones available. Everyone says that about speakers they're used to that don't have glaring response anomalies (and sometimes even if they do), but it's true here: the correction to flatten the HD600's frequency curve is minimal. Music tends to be mastered with a neutral output device in mind; if your hearing isn't unusual, neutral cans are likely to sound good over the broadest cross-section of material. Inner Fidelity's response plot of the HD600 might as well be a genre reference.\n\nThe HD650 is the same experience less some treble. It's constructed almost identically to the HD600; the $100 price difference has nothing to do with quality. Rolling the treble lends a ""warmer"" and slightly less detailed sound that'll flatter music mastered ""hot"" (with compressed dynamic range to make everything sound loud) or with an excessive treble bias. The HD650 also won't draw quite as much attention to themselves. Whether that's better is personal preference. The HD700 and HD800 take the opposite approach: you're getting detail whether you want it or not.\n\nNot all detail is the same. Detail comes from boosted treble or better drivers. Lesser cans favor treble. Bumping the high range sounds clear and vivid on first listen, but quickly becomes tiring. (Bose speaker demos are notorious for relying on this effect.) Better cans opt for more powerful, higher-impedance, lower-distortion drivers (or different technologies entirely as with electrostats) so intrinsically revealing that the manufacturer can use a more relaxed tone curve. The most detailed dynamic cans (i.e., the HD800) have only a mild treble bump (albeit marred by an unfortunate 6K peak). Less, even, than the HD700, which makes do with a less sophisticated driver. It's unsurprising, then, that reviewers tend to find the HD700 a little harsh on direct comparison.\n\nYou could approximate the HD650's tone curve by plugging the HD600 into tubes, but if that's really what you want, there's a better way.\n\nSIGNAL PROCESSING:\n\nHere we enter controversy. Audiophile purists believe in maintaining the integrity of the signal from recording to output. 24-bit audio, SACD, fancy cables, and Class A furnace amps are not out of place in this crowd. I respect the motivations for that view, but I've abandoned it with the HD600 for the better. We've had enormous advances in signal processing over the last twenty years. The HD600 is a mechanical device. It doesn't, and can't, have a perfectly flat frequency response. The cups and driver enclosure impact the sound too much, even if the driver itself could be made perfect, which it can't.\n\nBut if we measure the output curve, we can recreate any frequency response we want by digitally modifying the input. This is DSP: digital signal processing. The software equalizer in iTunes is a basic DSP, as is Autotune and every ""enhance"" button you've ever seen in a music player. The processing is almost never ""free"" (in the sense that it'll only have positive effects), but the benefits can vastly outweigh the downsides.\n\nTo jump straight to the point, a company called Sonarworks has measured and corrected the HD600. The plugin to apply the correction is about $70, and in addition to making the HD600 a legitimate tool for mastering, itll correct any perception that the HD600 is bass-light. Bass impact sounds speaker-like through it. The only corollary requirement is a VST-supporting player like J-River Media Jukebox or any of a dozen VST hosts (e.g., Audio Hijack, Pedalboard2). If you don't like the result, you can emulate a variety of other headphones. Grado GS1000? Sure. HD650? Yep. I hate spending money on things that aren't hardware, but in this case, I'm sold.\n\nIt gets better. After you've installed that, try Wave Arts Panorama5. It's a very powerful binaural emulator that'll take recordings out of your head and put the singer in front of you. Real binaural recordings use a dummy head with physical ears to create positioning cues that can sound wildly more realistic. Panorama (and free, albeit much inferior alternatives like 4Front and Psypan) attempt the same with math. Done well and matched to your ears, it can leave you agog. (""Why is my neighbor pounding on the ceiling? Oh. Wait."") Likewise a program (aptly) called ""Out of Your Head,"" which is expensive because the author measured a bunch of high-dollar audio setups. Want your HD600s to sound (exactly) like a movie theater? That's now a thing.\n\nIN SUM:\n\nTo wrap this novel: definitely try the HD600s. They're often on sale in the low $200s and there isn't a more complete product at that price. For $300 even, if you don't want to bother with an amp, consider the Hifiman 400S. While I preferred the Senns over the 400i, a number of folks rate the 400S slightly better than both despite the price gap. Oppo's PM3 remain a terrific choice if you're on the go, have small ears, and don't want to annoy everyone. Truly though, you can't go wrong with any of them.";HD600 vs. Many Other Headphones

I have tried all 3 with digital and analog sources and with old fashioned MOSFET amplification as well as modern Op-Amp amplification.  Compared to the Grado and AKG counterparts, I do not prefer the sound of these.  The most distinct area these are lacking is in the treble, which lacks the clarity of the AKG's or smoothness of the Grado's.

97;3.0;5.0;329.0;"How can four hundred dollar headphones be a good value?\nConsider it this way: Let's call a CD 10 dollars.

0;4.0;5.0;208.0;This is the best dynamic headphone in the world, and is rivalved only by the Grado RS-1 headphone.  Many studio engineers and audiophile's use these as their REFERENCE headphone...they are a steal for such a high quality headphone.  The Grado RS-1 [costs more], and is definately less comfortable than the Sennheisers.  These headphones have an extremely detailed, open, airy sound, that nears electrostatic sound.  They are also unique in that they suit all types of music very well, they have great punch for rock music, but can perform clasical pieces with all the fullness and detail they were designed.\nIt should be noted these headphone have an impedance of 300 ohms.  Most headphone are 16-32 ohms.  What this means is to get the full potential out of them you will need some type of amplifier.  Headphone.com offers a couple inexpensive sollutions to this problem, as does audioadvisor.com.  Althought they are not true audiophile components, they will greatly enhance your experience with these headphones.  If you are planning on travelling with them, you can almost bet you won't be content with their sound when powered only by a portable CD player.

5;5.0;4.0;35.0;"If you're reading this, you're deep enough into the audio hobby to have realized an important psychological truth about yourself: you can't leave well enough alone. Neither can I. That's why, even after falling head over heels in love with the sound of the HD650, I ordered the HD600. I just had to know.\n\nThe verdict? It's almost too close to call, but for my preferences the 650 is the better headphone. The two have been compared to death online, but if you have the capacity to think for yourself, audio review sites and forums are usually an unsavory if fascinating combination of shilling, self-justification, and ""follow the leader"" parroting of received opinions. Many self-proclaimed ""audiophiles"" have strong opinions about equipment they've never actually heard, which I can't accept.\n\nGiven that, I decided the only way to compare the two headphones honestly was to listen to both myself for hours, going back and forth on a wide variety of recordings. The difference between a good recording and a bad recording dwarfs the difference between lossy and lossless, and the HD600 (more so than the HD650) may end up changing your taste in music because it makes good recordings sound SO GOOD and bad recordings sound SO BAD. In other words, it reveals the ""truth"" of the recording, and sometimes the truth hurtsit's really hard to enjoy The Killers now.\n\nThe fact is that the 600 and 650 are ultimately more alike than different, and the popular insistence that they sound completely different has more to do with what Freud called ""the narcissism of small differences"" than the headphones themselves. If you Google some variation on ""HD650 vs HD600,"" you'll hear over and over that the 650 is ""bassier"" or ""darker."" Not really. There's actually very little difference across this parameter. Piano music presents an exception, but this is rarely what people think of as a bassy genre.\n\nThere are two significant differences. The first is soundstage. The HD650's soundstage is wider, but that doesn't mean it can make a cramped recording sound airy. The HD600's soundstage is more intimate; there's less space between left and right channels, but it's not a huge difference, and I could see people preferring (or at least not minding) the HD600's tighter spacing.\n\nThe most striking difference between the two headphones is in what I'd call ""smoothness."" The best analogy I can think of comes from digital photography. As an image sensor increases its sensitivity, it also increases its noise because you can't amplify a signal without also amplifying noise. There are two rival philosophies for dealing with noise: leave it as ""grain"" or smooth it out. Grain has its devotees, and the advantage of grain is that it preserves fine detail. The disadvantage is that past a certain point it becomes a distraction. The advantage of smoothness, meanwhile, is that it looks superficially nicer. The disadvantage is that when you look closely you won't see all the fine details. Like all things, it's a continuum of compromise. The 600 is the headphone to get if you value detail at the cost of an occasionally unpleasant grainy and even metallic quality to the sound. The 650 is the one to get if you care more about music than sound and don't care if your headphones sand down the sharp edges of your music a bit.\n\nGoing back and forth between the two, it quickly becomes clear that the 650 is the stronger all-around performer: it sounds nicer on more recordings and across more genres. The 600, meanwhile, is the champion of a particular niche: good recordings with lots of micro detail. Want to be able to count how many times the skin of a drum reverberates after it's struck? Want to hear such fine vocal gradations you'll know how a singer felt during recording? The 600 is for you.\n\nMake no mistake: at its best, the 600 produces the most astonishingly detailed sound I've ever heard. Unfortunately, at its worst it sounds grainy, jumbled, and not particularly musical. I'm sorry to report that piano music sounds particularly off on the 600: low frequencies disappear and take the fullness of the keys with them. Vocals can sound oddly recessed, even far away. In general, the 600 seems to fare better with female vocals than male ones, and with strings over pianos. It's absolutely glorious for acoustic guitar, but then, so is the 650.\n\nThe 650's great advantage lies in its ability to bring out vocals like a spotlight. They stand out so clearly and powerfully from the instrumentation that you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite songs for the first time. The effect is really quite incredible: it's like there's a special sonic space reserved for vocals and unpolluted by other sounds. Based on Sennheiser's own specs, the 650 has lower distortion than the 600 and it's clearly a more refined driver unit. Whatever the technical reason, the 650's background is pitch black: sounds rise from and fall back into a sea of silence. Be forewarned: a well-recorded vocal track through the 650 may bring tears to your eyes, and that's why I kept the 650 and returned the 600.\n\nFinally, let's talk about measurements. While there's a valid SUBJECTIVE argument for preferring the sound of the 600, the 650 has an objectively better driver that improves on its predecessor in every way: higher sensitivity, lower distortion, and better power handling. Here are the figures straight from Sennheiser's manuals, which you can find for yourself on the product pages for both headphones at bhphotovideo[dot]com. The terminology used isn't consistent from one manual to the other, but the parameters in question are the same. I've noted these variations where applicable.\n\nFrequency response (-10db): 12  38,000 Hz (HD600), 10  39,500 Hz (HD650)\nImpedance: 300 ohms (same for both)\nSensitivity/""Loudness"" (Sennheiser also calls this ""Sound pressure level at 1 kHz""): 97 dB (HD600), 103 dB (HD650)\nLoad rating (Sennheiser also calls this ""Long-term max. input power""): 0.2W aka 200mW (HD600), 500mW (HD650)\nTHD (Total Harmonic Distortion): 0.1% (HD600), 0.05% (HD650)\n\nIn short, the HD650 will get louder than the 600 because it has higher sensitivity at the same resistance. The fact that it can handle almost twice as much INPUT power is a positive, not a negative; if you turned a decent amp ALL THE WAY UP with the HD600 connected, you could damage or even destroy the drivers. The 650 has enough headroom for more than twice as much input power, but there's little point in driving your headphones loud enough for permanent hearing loss.\n\nAt the end of the day, headphone preference, like any preference, is primarily subjective, and I can't seriously imagine anyone being unhappy with the HD600.";Detail at all costs
86;6.0;5.0;92.0;"I have been building and listening to audiophile sound systems for more than 20 years.  Having listened through Sennheiser HD580s for several years and finding them excellent, I feel comfortable saying that the HD600s are a very significant improvement in clarity and overall sound quality.  The main differences between the HD580 and HD600 appear to be in better reasonance control throughout the entire mechanical system and evolutionary driver improvements.  The HD600s do indeed approach perfection.  Their sound quality is not easily surpassed by $10,000 loudspeakers.\n\nHowever, several caveats are in order.  Like loudspeakers, these headphones do require several days of playing time to break in and open up, particularly in the lower frequencies.  The reason for this is simple physics: when new the suspensions are stiff and need some work to loosen up and allow larger, low frequency excursions to happen more easily.  The may sound a little cool at first, but will warm up after many hours of playing time.  They will also sound clearer.  When breaking them in, don't play them louder than you would normally listen.\n\nSecond, these headphones are extremely revealing of the electronics feeding them.  An audiophile-quality headphone amplifier, such as those made by headphone.com, is necessary to get the best sound of of them.  The source electronics are also clearly audible.  It would be appropriate to use these with multi-thousand dollar D/A converters or CD/SACD/DVD/vinyl rigs.  Used with cheap or inferior source electronics, the sound will be severely limited.  It's a bit like putting ketchup on a $20 steak.\n\nThird, these headphones are extremely revealing of the quality of recordings.  Unfortunately very few recordings, especially mainstream commercial ones, have really good sound quality.  A few audiophile labels have consistently good sound such as Reference Recordings, a few jazz labels, etc.  Occasionally a large record company may have a recording or a track with good sound, but they seem very rare and almost due to random chance.  That's not a fault of the headphones, but of the source material.  It's proof that the quality and resolution of these headphones is extremely high that they can help reveal those differences to the attuned ear.\n\nOther highlights: very comfortable for most people, relatively light weight, free-space equalization, meaning the frequency balance is designed to be like natural sound in an open area.  The latter is part of the reason these headphones ""don't sound like headphones"" and instead sound like real music, along with the mechanical resonance reduction practiced throughout.\n\nVery likely these headphones will not be the limiting factor of the sound quality for most systems they are used in.  Electronics and recording sources are probably a larger factor, which is a sign that these are indeed audiophile goodies.  Given the very high quality of engineering and quality control behind the HD600s, they are a tremendous bargain even at their price.  However, their benefits will not be fully realized in less than excellent systems.";Outstanding headphones
80;7.0;5.0;62.0;"Well, if you're here, then you probably know what you're looking at. If not, let me explain.\n\nThe HD600 was introduced by Sennheiser as the replacement for their highly acclaimed HD580. It was essentially the HD580 Jubilee edition, but re-dressed and re-badged. As such, it shares nearly everything with the HD580 Jubilee, and shares it's drivers with the HD580. The HD600 has been on Stereophile's A list for ages, and hasn't budged despite passing years and many new models from competitors. It has also been the golden standard for neutrality and accuracy in recording studios worldwide.\n\nWhat does the HD600 sound like? Quite simply, it sounds much like the components that you have upstream, but with more weight and body to the sound. The HD600 is uncolored enough that every change in your signal path results in a different sound signature. You hear exactly how your CD player sounds, how your amp sounds, how your cables sound (yes, I know this statement disqualifies me with the audio cynics... well, so be it). In my experience with hi-fi and more specifically headphone hi-fi, I've yet to find another headphone that sounds so neutral, so very ""right"" with everything that I throw at it.\n\nIt is detailed, but presents detail in a relaxed manner. It is very airy and open but doesn't sound thin. It has a strong bass but it's quite clear and well defined. It has a melodic midrange but it's clean and articulate. It has exactly the right tone and tembre on every instrument. And it does it all in a very coherent, integrated fashion. Everything is part of a greater sonic whole, and works together in a coherent fashion to recreate beautiful music. Most prominently, it has a sense of weight and solidity to every sound that is very much speaker-like. I have heard this kind of solidity in other headphones, but in many cases it has worked detrimentally to the music. In this case, it adds a sense of magical realism that's hard to find elsewhere.\n\nYou probably are aware that this headphone needs an amp. That's definitely true. Don't connect it to an mp3 player expecting it to sing, because it won't. A dedicated headphone amplifier is a must. I will also go further than that and say that a dedicated hi-fi source is a must, since this headphone does, once again, sound like it's upstream components.\n\nHere's what I suggest for building a good headphone rig around the HD600:\n\nStart with an inexpensive source with an optical line-out. A cheap Sony D-NE920 will do quite well, or any other PCDP with an optical line-out. Next, get a standalone DAC, either a portable battery powered model like a Headroom MicroDAC (amazing little product) or a full-size jitter-immune DAC like the Benchmark DAC1. Next, if you're going the portable route, get a good portable amp - I use the Ray Samuels Hornet currently, and it's a killer piece of amplification. If you're going with a stationary home DAC, then make sure that it has balanced outputs, and get a true balanced amplifier (Headamp GS-X is a good model, as is the Heardoom Max Balanced, or perhaps a cheaper but still excellent SFT-build balanced M^3). Finish it off with a decent set of IC's (Grover Ultimate Reference is a great inexpensive cable), and replace the dinky cable that came with your HD600's (I like the Moon Audio cables myself). You'll need an XLR-terminated cable for your balanced amp. You can throw in power conditioning if you believe in that sort of thing, but it's really up to you. Lastly, throw on your favorite recording, relax, and enjoy. For this is what the HD600 will do - relax and let the music flow.\n\nI've heard some very serious phones - the Sennheiser Orpheus, Sony MDR-R10, Sony Qualia 010, together with countless less-expensive phones. Properly amped and properly driven, the HD600 can play with the best of them. It's a real steal at the price, but make sure to pair it with quality gear.\n\n****\n\nLet me address some previous reviews.\n\nTo the gentleman who claimed that this sounds muddy next to Stax headphones - I agree. Stax headphones really are unique in terms of clarity, but since they're electrostatic, this is to be expected. However, driven balanced, the HD600 can come close to this sort of clarity, and will be more realistic in terms of tembre and texture. I prefer it in some ways over the SR-007, and I own the SR-404 myself, so I'm no stranger to Stax.\n\nTo the reviewer below who claims that the A900 and MDR-V7506 are better phones: I suggest you get your facts straight. The HD600 is used nearly as much as the V7506 in the studio. I also happen to own the A900, and I honestly cannot say that it sounds just as natural as the HD600. It has an upper-midrange honky coloration that is distinctly artificial. Having played piano for 13 years, I know how the instrument is supposed to sound, and the HD600 is it. The A900 isn't. But, I will agree with you, to some extent, when it comes to the HD650. This latter phone is voiced rather differently from the HD600, and does sound colored to my ears.";The King
14;8.0;5.0;17.0;"It's easy to forget that, next year, the HD 600 will turn 20 years old. Admittedly, audio transducers have a funny way of sticking around longer than just about any other piece of electronics equipment. A line of speakers will, usually, be in production for at least several years. Even when they've been replaced, they usually aren't even close to obsolete, because even mid-fi has gotten pretty far into diminishing returns. But, even in this alternate timeline of audiophile-dom (others might call it an alternate reality, an insane asylum...) the HD 600s are freakin ancient. I can only think of a few other cans with this kind of longevity:\n\nThe Sony MDR-V6; so old that it still has ""for DIGITAL"" emblazoned on the side. A quick trip through audio theory will reveal that this is meaningless, but in 1985 it sounded really cool.\n\nThe Beyerdynamic DT770/880/990; so old that they still have shag carpet earpads.\n\nVarious Grados; so old that it's too late for anybody to admit they sound like trash. Instead, they just mumble something about ""sparkle"" and then go buy something else.\n\nAnd yet, 20 years later, the HD600 is still the headphone that, within headphone circles, everybody talks about and everybody has heard. There's a reason for that: it's not just really good. Purely on the strength of its sound, it stands out as excellent. When price is considered? It might just be the best headphone in the world.\n\nTHE SOUND:\nInevitably, whenever anyone tries to talk about the HD600 or the HD650, someone brings up the ""Sennheiser Veil."" This so-called veil was a kind of muffling of the sound, and the people who complain about it would have you believe that the HD6XX sounds like Apple Earpods.\n\nI cannot state emphatically enough how much the veil does not exist. It is either a product of the imagination of people who wish the AKG K701 was a bit brighter, or the result of people trying to plug the HD6XX straight into an inadequate source, i.e. most phones, MP3 players, iPods, laptops, etc. They need an amp. More on that later. At any rate, these headphones are as veiled as Eva Green in The Dreamers. You. Will. See. erm, Hear. Everything.\n\nThat's both a blessing and a curse. Lesser headphones - even my Sony MDR-V6s, for instance - can mask the flaws in a bad recording. All of those 128kbps MP3s you've pirated because you're a bad person? They're gonna sound awful. If your father-in-law-to-be hands sends you some recordings of his garage band, grab however awful a set of backup cans you need for it to sound good. Because these will tell you the truth. Yet, to a good recording, they are shockingly flattering. If you put garbage in, you'll get garbage out. Give it something good, though, and you'll get magic. I've listened to just about my entire music library with these, and there are a few recordings in particular that really demonstrate how well these shine:\n\n-In the Air Tonight (Phil Collins, Face Value, 1981): On a decent-to-good set of headphones, this song sounds ominous; it sounds cool. Whatever. On the HD600s, it's a religious experience. Sounds swirl around your head. The crescendos and diminuendos blow you away. The vocals sound perfect. Incredible.\n\n-In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel, So, 1986): The entire album is fabulous. Listen to it over and over again. But there's a reason this song is singled out. It's a sibilance nightmare. On my MDR-V6s, it's unlistenable above a moderate volume. Enter the HD600s: there's no hiding how much sibilance there is, but they handle it as gracefully as possible.\n\nEnough ink has been spilled over how these handle classical and jazz (spoiler: fabulously), and their vocal presentation in particular is spot-on.\n\nTHE STUFF YOU'LL NEED:\nTo get all of this brilliant sound, you're going to need a few things. First and foremost is an amp. This can get crazy pretty quick, so first let's draw a distinction: solid state vs tubes. The HD600 has a high enough impedance to really get along with OTL amps (ie, most headphone tube amps). This will color the sound somewhat, get hot, be unreliable, need to warm up, etc. If you want to go down this road, you can. There's also a lot of really expensive solid state amps.\n\nOr, you could just get a Schiit Magni or a JDS Objective2, both of which sound... well... about perfect.\n\nNext, you'll need to think about a DAC. Now, a lot of people just assume they'll need one. That may not be the case. If you have a Retina Macbook Pro, for instance, skip it. You'll never hear the difference between it and whatever you get for 150 bucks. Same deal if you're plugging a (good) CD player or receiver or whatever straight into the amp. If your source is something else, like a midrange PC, you'll need to evaluate this yourself. Unfortunately, I can't help you with that.\n\nIf you decide you need a DAC, there are a lot of expensive options out there.\n\nOr, you could just get a Schiit Modi or a JDS ODAC, both of which sound... well... about perfect.\n\n(Side lesson: The internet audiophile community fights back and forth all the time about whether the O2/ODAC or the Magni/Modi is the better setup. Realistically, their performance is nearly identical. Buy whichever you think looks better.)\n\n(Another side lesson: You seriously probably don't need to spend a ton of money on DACs and amps. The O2/ODAC was designed by some wacky internet crusader who wanted to prove that the performance of the Benchmark DAC2 and HPA2 could be achieved without spending thousands of dollars. From an engineering perspective, this is obviously possible. If you look into this further, you will still find people who insist that the O2/ODAC doesn't sound as good as significantly more expensive gear. Just remember that these are audiophile crazies, who think they need 192kHz recordings because Nyquist-Shannon doesn't apply to special snowflakes. The two most important things in any digital-to-analog system are the input file and the transducer.)\n\nFinally, you're going to need good recordings. iTunes is sufficient. Vinyl is pretty good (repeat after me: vinyl does not sound better than CD, it is objectively worse, a record will only sound great 25 times, and will be the equal of the CD never). CD is your best bet, particularly those mastered before the ""loudness wars"" started up in the late 1990s. However, the world isn't perfect; fear not, the Senns still sound good with stuff that has a compressed dynamic range (within reason). Anything beyond the Redbook CD standard is simply a ploy to get you to spend more money for things you can't hear, and that your dog can't either.\n\nSOME REALITIES:\nThe way that the Senns achieve all this great sound is by being ""open-back"" headphones. This means that, on the side of the driver opposite your ear, there's just some mesh to protect it from damage. This means that you can't really use these outside a quiet environment, because you'll hear everything around you. It also means that you probably won't want to listen to them in public, because it's really difficult to look cool when everybody knows you're blasting the Bangles.\n\nAlso, they're ugly as sin. But they aren't leaving your house, so who cares?\n\nA WORD ABOUT THE HD650:\nReleased several years after the HD600, the HD650 at first glance looks like an upgrade. That... depends. The HD650 is darker and smoother at the expense of detail. That's all. I prefer its sound signature. But, it usually costs between 75 and 150 dollars more than the HD600, and so it wasn't worth it for me. It probably isn't worth it for you, either.\n\nSo, yeah. These headphones sound just about dead neutral, wonderfully crisp, and yet smooth enough that you can listen at high volumes without fatigue. They can usually be had for less than 300 dollars. And for the price, they have no equal. Now we just have to hope that someday the HD800S can be such an easy decision to make.";Goldilocks' Cans
47;9.0;5.0;28.0;"It would seem that my review has turned out to be a sort of comparison of the Sennheiser HD 598s to the HD 600s.  While it wasn't where I intended to go, I think the comparison is valid when deciding if the $200 premium is worth the payout (it is).\n\nI have owned/auditioned a ton of headphones over the years, and I currently have a pretty decent assortment in my stable.  But these HD 600s are probably going to have all those other pairs collecting dust.  About a month ago I had purchased a pair of HD 598s and they were the pair of cans that finally sold me on open phones.  I really like the 598s, and they are excellent for classical, jazz, classic rock, and many other genres music.  However, when it came to listening to contemporary popular music they just seemed to come up short.  The HD 600s are a much better ""all around"" headphone, and well worth the additional $200 (in my opinion).  Their superiority was evident from the moment I put them on and plugged them in.  I played Chris Isaac's ""Wicked Game"" and I literally had a chill run up my spine.  More bass than the 598s?  Yes; but it's not unnatural in any way whatsoever.  It just adds to the richness/quality of the overall sound.  These make everything just sound more real, and they seem to do it almost effortlessly.  After listening to the 600s for an extended period and then going back to the 598's, the differences become more noticeable.  Again,  where the 598s start to struggle, the 600s just power through.  I completely understand why so many people consider these to be some of the best phones ever produced.  I have also been tricked into looking around the room for that noise I just heard only to realize it was part of the recording.  If you need to stick to a budget, the 598s are an excellent choice and a fantastic bargain (just watch and wait for the price to dip).  However, if you can afford the premium price, the HD 600s are worth every penny.\n\nMy listening setup consists of a variety of digital files played from my computer, an Onkyo C-7030 CD player, and a Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  I should also add that I don't use any equalization with my phones.  I messed around running the phones directly off the computer's headphone jack, and I have to say that I highly recommend a good DAC/Amp to get the most out of these cans, as the added power really brings them to life.  And remember that to truly ""Listen"" to these phones you need to be in a quiet environment.\n\nA few other observations:  The 600's clamp quite a bit tighter than the 598s, though they do seem to be loosening up a bit with use.  I think the 598s actually sound a bit wider and a touch brighter, but my 600's only have about 15 hours on them at this writing and like the 598s, I expect them to open up after more time.  I may invest in a better cable in the future, but the included cable gets the job done, and it's more flexible than the one for the 598's (which I also replaced).  I had thought about comparing these to some of my other closed phones for my review, but really, I don't feel that any of them even comes close to these 600s. I've also noticed that with the 598's it is important to find that sweet spot in the volume where the sound really starts to shine, while the 600's play much better and more balanced over a wider range of volume (high and low).\n\nI am looking forward to enjoying these headphones for many years to come.  If you have any comments or questions I welcome them and will try my best to answer.  I did extensive research prior to this purchase, so if I can't answer a specific question I may be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nUpdate 1:  After probably 20 more hours of listening I can clarify my comment about the 598s being a little bit brighter.  On certain pieces when I hear a high-hat cymbal on the 598's, I hear it as one sound, and mostly the sound of the cymbal.  On the 600's you clearly hear the stick hitting the cymbal, and the sound of the cymbal itself.  So, I would say the high end of the 600s may not be perceived as being as bright as the 598's, but it is much more defined, clear, and controlled.";Absolutely Fantastic!
96;10.0;2.0;58.0;All these reviews are correct.  These are the most comfortable headphones you'll ever wear.  They have the cleanest, clearest sound.  But the durability is a terrible problem!  I have two pairs of 580's, and one has been back 3 times and the other 2 times.  The problem is the jacks that connect the cable to the headphone eventually get loose, causing the earpieces to cut out.  Both are now out of commission again.  All the great sound and comfort in the world will do no good if they don't play...  (5 stars for sound, 5 stars for comfort, and 0 stars for reliability);Best - and Worst -'Phones
40;11.0;5.0;24.0;"My road to the Sennheiser HD 600's has been a little long and filled with some interesting twists and turns that have, or so I hope, led me to a better understanding of what are a great set of headphones.  Naturally it is very typical to wish to compare these to other headphones.  After all, isn't that how we so often make purchasing decisions?  We try differing products until we find the one which works best/right for our needs.  So my review is going to work on two fronts:  a review of the product itself, and a review against some competitors I have acquired in the last year in my quest to find headphones that are right for me.  And hopefully for you.\n\nRegarding the HD600's themselves I have mostly nothing but excellent news to report.  Personally, I like the way they look.  The mottled black and blue coloring is different, but not garish in any way.  The large and deep oval ear cups are precisely what one wants for an over-the-ear design.  At 6'4"" I'm certainly sporting a larger head than the average male and fortunately for me my entire ears fit comfortably inside the ear cups.  My ears do not touch the protective cloth over the drivers, but the outer edge of my ear does touch at places around the inside of the ear cup.  This is a minor annoyance and goes unnoticed some of the time. Those of you more average of height and head size will likely never have this issue.  The ear cups themselves are very comfortable, seal well to my head and do not get hot even after a good number of hours of use.  This also means the head clamping  force is perfect for me; I never feel like my head is being squeezed.  Everything about the headphones seems to indicate they are well-made, but I cannot help but feel the plastic seems a bit thin.  Maybe cheap even.  They do not creak and nothing flexes, but it's the only part which lets me down at all about the headphones.\n\nThe included box, while awesome for storage, is clearly not oriented for travel.  But I would argue these aren't portable headphones meant for the on-the-go user.  They do not fold up.  The ear cups do not turn to lay flat.  And considering the amplification needed to properly drive these, using a typical portable music player (your cell phone, iPod, etc.) isn't ideal anyway.\n\nNow for what I consider to be the more important part of how I came to select the HD600: research and listening.  Let's first be clear about something... audio equipment is not unlike some other equipment markets in that you often spend exponentially more money for an item just to gain minor, incremental increases in some important criteria.  To you speaker X sounds better than speaker Y, all other things being equal.  It's likely speaker X costs more.  Most of the time it will cost more, but not all of the time.  But how much more does it cost and how much more quality of sound are you receiving for that additional cost?  It's almost always a matter of diminishing returns... loads more money for a bit firmer bass or slightly clearer treble.  But this is the nirvana for which we seek in audio equipment.\n\nOver the last year I purchased two other sets of headphones:  Grado 80e and Sennheiser Momentum.  Clearly the Grado's at $100 are the least expensive with the Momentum jumping up markedly to $299, while the more recently acquired Sennheiser HD600 hit the $400 mark.  Comparing my first two purchases, the 80e's and Momentum's, the differences were pretty straight-forwarded.  To me the Grado's sounded brighter with good bass and sligthly harsh mids (""smeared"" is the word which came to mind as I compared them in listening tests at home).  The Mometum's sounded more laid back (not as bright) with great bass (that could be a bit smeared itself in the upper bass) and definitely superior mids (thinking men's voices here - became painfully obvious will using a live track from Morrissey between the two headphones).  And so it was I came to find myself using each pair for different purposes.\n\nThe Grado 80e's became my preferred can for classical music (a genre into which I am becoming more deeply involved of late) as I felt, for my personal preferences, the brighter qualities enhanced the instruments typical of classical music, while the bass was more than sufficient.  But when I wanted to rock (or alternative as is more often the case) I broke out the Momentum's.  The accentuated, but not overblown bass, was quite welcome and I noticed less the laid back nature of the treble, especially as I used them more and more.\n\nBut with the also recent purchase of some better home audio equipment (Marantz CD6005 CD player and a SoundEngine D1 DAC/Headphone amp for my computer - listening to ALAC encoded tracks) I found myself thinking both the Momentum and 80e were somehow lacking.  That I wasn't getting everything I could from my music via this better equipment.\n\nFrom all the research I had done previously I elected to spend the money and purchase the HD600.  I don't think I have found a single bad review out there in the Internet sphere.  A few have thought them a little warm or laid back.  But most every review hits upon how, and especially for the money, the HD600s hit all the right notes (sorry).  Having had them burned in for 30-hours the listening tests began.  I had considered this purchase principally for classical music.  I really didn't think I'd get more from them for rock/alternative than I was already getting from the Momentums and so it was the classical CDs came out and I plugged into the CD player.  I also plugged in the Grados to the Marantz A/V receiver, direct mode engaged.  Adjusting for volume as best I could (this is hardly scientific) I played a handful of very familiar tracks from very familiar CDs; swapping back and forth between the HD600s and Grado 80e.\n\nIt too almost no time to hear the difference.  I'll concede that it's sometimes difficult to put into words the differences heard, but I'll try.  The first thing I noticed were the violins.  When a number of them are playing notes together the Grado's sounded smeared compared to the HD600s.  Not unlike a poorly created JPEG from a digital point-n-shoot versus a well-made JPEG from an original RAW processed via Adobe Lightroom.  Details are are lost in the former, but the latter does a far superior job of keeping the detail even in the process of losing information.  The HD600 left me feeling like I was actually sitting there in the room with the musicians.  I'm not referring to placement of the instruments (the HD600 do a good job, but I've read reviews for other cans that do better), but simply how clear, precise, concise and live-sounding are the violins.  Actually, it was true of all the stringed instruments.  The resonance of the strings... their very clear nature... was a welcome and astonishing difference.\n\nGranted, the Grado's are one-quarter the cost and I shouldn't be surprised the HD600's sounded better.  Markedly better.  And I didn't have to listen long or hard to notice the differences.  They are obvious; not subtle.  That said, I can't say I was every displeased with the Grado's.  It was only in comparison to the HD600's that it became possible to hear and understand the Grado's limitations.\n\nAnd like the stringed instruments, voices also became sharper, clearer, more focused.  I had found what I was looking for regarding my classical music interests: a pair of headphones that while generally neutral (which some would consider to be 'flat' and flat has, I think, a negative connotation), are not at all boring or flat.  I feel the music is more alive than ever in comparison to the Grado's.\n\nSo... I also broke out some rock and alternative music (the recently remastered Led Zeppelin discs, some Nine Inch Nails and Pet Shop Boys) to see what the HD600's could do.  Here I feared the Momentum would just kick butt thanks to the fuller bass, but I must say the HD600's continued to impress.  All the good things they brought to mid and higher frequencies (clarity, precision) were still present, but, surprisingly, the bass was rock solid as well. I may hate myself for saying it, but I think the bass was a bit better.  The upper-bass bloat in the Momentum's doesn't appear on the HD600's, which tends to make the lower-bass stand out more because they aren't overwhelmed by the enhanced upper-bass.  I'd still say the Momentum's have more punch and who doesn't like that when listening to rock or alternative, but I could find myself readily using the HD600's just as often for The Smiths, The Cure, Skinny Puppy, etc. as I would the Momentum's.\n\nAnd here I think I have found a most excellent trio of headphones.  Finding one perfect pair of headphones for all needs and opportunities is probably impossible.  But I think I have accidentally stumbled upon a most excellent hat trick of cans that meet my various needs.  I like to listen to music when I'm on the go; I have needs for portability.  And while not truly the most portable of headphones, the Grado's for classical (and still quite reasonable for rock and alternative) and the Momentum's for rock and alternative (I confess I don't like them as much for classical as I do the Grado's for rock and alternative), AND the HD600's for more critical, at-home listening with audio equipment that has enough amplifier ooomph to properly push them.\n\nAdd my name and voice to the long list of of folks who think, dollar for dollar, the Sennheiser HD600 are the best value in headphones out there.";All the very positive reviews cannot be wrong.... and they aren't
20;12.0;5.0;18.0;I use Sennheiser closed back for all my live sound gigs, I have about 6 pairs of HD280's for FOH and keyboard rigs. Never have had a problem, and they are old and abused. While they're good for that, I wanted something I could get a halfway decent mix on that translates well to my home recording monitor setup.\n\nI went with the HD-600 open back design because in my experience, the low mids are not accurate in any closed back design I've used. It's a big deal when it comes to making space for the vocals and especially the bass. With all the positive reviews for this set of cans, I figured all of these people can't be wrong. They're not, and I'm glad I took their advice.\nAfter working on a few mixes on just headphones, mixing in the box, I am happy to say that the spectral balance of what I was mixing on the HD 600's translates extremely well to a pair of Yamaha HS8's with a balanced sub. The thing I'm most happy about is the bass, but the high end is also well balanced (flat), and the vocals sit in the mix just as they do in the headphones. Effects aren't jumping out, instrument levels are sitting in the mix well, and the stereo imaging translates accurately. Two of the songs are basically done with just some reverb adjustments, that's saying a lot.\nI'm really surprised, actually, I think I have found a pair of cans I can really trust.\nSo many reviewers have said they wish they had used these from the start. +1\nBelieve it, start going go to audio church.;Not hyped at all.
93;13.0;4.0;52.0;"These are excellent audiophile headphones, no doubt about it.  Their reproduction of sound is superior, and there is no attempt to render the sound excessively bass-y or to otherwise alter/distort whatever signal the source happens to deliver.  This actually is a mixed blessing, since many contemporary listeners now seem to expect a exaggeratedly bass-heavy sound from their headphones.\nThese are gorgeously made, high quality 'phones, but they are not for everyone. The potential drawbacks to using these headphones are several.  First, the HD600 does such a fine job of amplifying input that it will render all the clearer any flaws in the audio system to which it is hooked up.  Consequently, using these with a very cheap overall sound system can actually backfire.  Second, the impedance associated with these 'phones is very high, so they will not produce much volume when used directly with a portable cd or md player.  You NEED to use a headphone amplifier with any portable or other low-output device.  Third, the design of these headphones is of the ""open"" variety.  This helps in their superior sound reproduction, but it also means that if you are in a crowded room listening to music, everyone around you will know just what you are listening to and may not be as pleased with the experience as you are. If you need isolation, you are better off buying either ""closed"" headphones or else, even better, some first-rate (ear) canal phones such as the Etymotic ER-4's.\nFinally, as has already been pointed out, these headphones are quite luxuriant in their on-ear padding, but as a result they can become uncomfortably hot or itchy to wear.\nWith those caveats in mind, these are still among the best stereo headphones currently made, and if you understand beforehand just what to expect with the HD600's, you will surely enjoy them.";Pricey, well-made, not for everyone

3;15.0;5.0;6.0;I bought these as well as the 650's and ended up sending the 650's back after comparing the two for a couple of weeks. I thought I would prefer the slightly more warm and forgiving nature of the 650's, as I listen to a lot of badly recorded music of all varieties, i.e. rap, metal, punk, various indie and electronic, etc. along with more well recorded jazz and classical, even some audiophile vinyl pressings of various albums. I learned that I prefered the more neutral and balanced sound of the 600's even on average or poorly recorded material. The 650's seemed to color the sound more without making it more enjoyable necessarily, while the 600's made me want to listen more even when the music sounded less than perfect. I find these especially telling when I'm listening to records, as the difference in cartridges and pre-amp setting are very apparent, along with any distorting that occurs due to damaged vinyl or poor setup by me. These actually sound pretty good through my Android phone streaming Tidal, too, although they will benefit from better amplification. The other pair of headphones I use regularly are Grado 225e, and the 600's are a nice compliment to those, a different sound for sure, and one that I prefer 90% of the time that I'm doing any serious listening. The best sounding amp I've heard with these is the Emotiva BasX A-100, but beware, that thing is powerful and almost too much for some sources like my cd transport. My phono stage is somewhat quiet at 38db of gain and works pretty well with it, and of course if you do computer audio you can adjust the volume that way. I constantly want to upgrade other parts of my system, but after several months have been happy with the 600's and don't feel like I need another pair of headphones.;while the 600's made me want to listen more even when the music sounded less than perfect. I find these especially telling when I'm listening ...
99;16.0;5.0;44.0;"Plenty of superlatives have been heaped upon the HD-600s - and for good reason. They almost hint at perfection, and even while that outworldly ideal will always prove elusive, the HD-600s are an livable earth-bound solution. Their most remarkable sonic characteristics are balanced, natural tonality and the presence of remarkable detail and transparency. The sounds coming from these 'phones are of such natural rightness, you sometimes forget you are listening to a reproduced event. Of course, since the HD-600s are so transparent, you'll hear source tape flaws you never noticed before and these can ruin the magical illusion. But don't blame the Sennheisers for revealing the truth.\nPrior to owning the HD-600s, I used the fantastic HD-580s for about one year. One thing that surprises me (well, actually, it doesn't) is how quickly audiophiles pronounce the HD-600s leagues better than the HD-580s. I listened to each set profusely under careful conditions and came to the realization that the HD-580s offer about 95% of the performance of the HD-600s. The most notable difference is that the HD-600s remove a very thin veil of ""sonic haze"" from the music. But they both share the same character and personality and I would expect them to generate very similar test lab results. In my experience, many audiophiles will consider that extra 5% ""a tremendous improvement"". As to avoid being hypocritical, I did enjoy the HD-600s more and decided to keep them over the HD-580s, but take all superlatives and Grand Statements with a grain of salt, as you should in audiophiledom. If the HD-600s are priced out of your league, the discontinued and discounted HD-580s are a can't miss baragin.\nBut even at [price], the HD-600s are a surprising value. A pedestrian pair of bookshelf loudspeakers will set you back [price] and they don't even come close to producing the heavenly sounds of the Sennheisers. And if you aren't a headphone person, time spent with these Sennheisers might change your mind. They did with me!\nI also connect my Sennheisers directly to my Panasonic portable on the go. Sure, an outboard amp would be nice, but who wants all that bulk and weight? Aside from more limited volume, most portables I've used are more than capable of driving the HD-600s with clarity, neutrality and practically no distortion. So don't worry about getting an amp right away...you might find the extra equipment unnecessary.\nThe Sennheisers are my favorite piece of audio equipment. Their sonic performance and portability allow musical contentment late at night, at work, outside, wherever. They are the best [price] I've ever spent on audio.";The best is also a surprising value
43;17.0;3.0;19.0;"For quite some time I was curious as to what was truly out there when it came to good headphones. Being interested in upgrading from my Audio Technica ath-m50 headphones I scoured the web for information on headphones reading numerous reviews and comparisons. The hd600 came up relatively often and was praised for its great value, neutral sound, ability to handle near any genre, and comfort. Seeing it available at $300 down from $400 like new, I convinced myself to go for it.\nThe wait for it to arrive could not go fast enough and amazingly enough this was the first time I have had a product arrive before the estimated delivery date. Finally it was time to spend some time getting used to my new headphones and sizing them up. What I found was really quite surprising.\n\nThe bass was the most obvious difference right off the bat. Coming from the m50's which are supposedly bass heavy and ""v shaped"" in their sound signature I expected the bass to take a back seat with these headphones. Nearly all comments I have heard on bass about the hd600 described it as light, or neutral, most certainly not the bass-head's headphone. At least for me, the low end sounds very present and well represented. Actually for the first time in some tracks I felt like I could properly hear the previously washed out bass line. If this is what bass neutral sounds like I can only imagine the slam in a bass heavy headphone.\n\nThe mid-range is slightly fuller and clearer but I would not say the difference is night and day. As for the treble I notice the least amount of difference. I can say for certain that harsh highs or sibilance are practically non-existent provided the source is not overly so to begin with.\n\nThe deciding factor on me choosing an open backed headphone was my desire for a greater sense of space, an effect I so often hear described by reviewers. To my disappointment the hd600 appears to be lacking in this department almost severely. Switching back and forth between my closed pair and these reveals no significant difference in sense of space. I did account for difference in recordings thinking that maybe I am simply not listening to music that demonstrates an impressive soundstage. After listening to some binaural and spacious recordings I have concluded the soundstage is indeed minimal.\n\nWith these headphones being open I was concerned about their leaking of sound perhaps to the point of annoying others in the same room. Thankfully it is far less an issue than I anticipated. For an accurate comparison, play your music of choice (a little louder than you would normally listen) on some closed headphones with them off your head and point the cups outward. What you hear will be pretty close to these.\n\nSomething odd I discovered is that these headphones actually sound louder than my m50's with the same exact volume level. I have no idea why this is as both the hd600's sensitivity rating and ohm rating are greater than the m50's. I am using these headphones with only my onboard sound on my pc. I was prepared to buy an amplifier to go with them, but I find I get ample volume even with the quietest of tracks. If anyone has any critical comparison experience of these headphones with a stronger amplifier and its effect on the sound I would love to hear about it.\n\nThe comfort on these headphones is fairly mediocre. The pads could stand to be much softer and roomier. Unexpanded the headphones are very small, but they expand quite a lot, more than I could ever see someone needing. The clamp is strong out of the box, so much so if you need to move around for some reason while wearing these they will not be going anywhere. The clamp can be lessened by fully extending the bands and bending just the exposed metal. Bending the plastic along with it would probably cause it to break. Speaking of general build quality and aesthetics, these headphones are not bad at all. They do not exude class or luxury like some others in the same price range, but they are well put together and look great in my opinion. The weakest point is the swivel on the cups. They feel loose and not sturdily attached. The cable included is very thin and does not seem to be of very high quality. I like a thin and light cable myself but if you would like an upgrade, the hd650 cable looks much beefier.\n\nI am faced with a dilemma. I do enjoy these headphones, but do I feel they offer $300 worth of improvement, even spread over their lifetime? I would say no. at the full price of $400 I would strongly suggest trying out headphones in person and consider what things are most important to you in a headphone. At this price point, I feel a high end experience can be expected in all aspects of form and function.\n\nIn conclusion, the merits of the hd600's are seemingly substantially over exaggerated. This is not to take away from their solid performance, but until these headphones reach a price point of $200-$250 I suspect there are better choices available.\n\nEdit: Due to concerns about me not evaluating the hd600 with proper amplification, please take my comments about sound quality with that in mind.\n\nEdit Part 2: It has been quite awhile but I can now update this review after having purchased an O2 headphone amplifier. My findings are on the unfortunate side, as It seems I can't hear any discernible difference in sound quality using the headphones from my  onboard sound v.s my headphone amplifier. I once again tried using them with my Iphone 4 and compared with the amp, but the results were the same. This goes completely against what I've been told countless times, leading me to believe expectation bias for audio must be incredibly powerful.";Sennheiser HD600 Headphone Review:
72;18.0;4.0;32.0;"There have been so many reviews here I almost didn't write one but with the lack of reviews by producers I decided to add one more to the list.\n\nIf you're producing audio like myself you already know theres no replacement for a good set of monitors. That said there's a few reasons you may be mixing through a set of cans.\nMy reasons are that my studio is sometimes mobile and that I'm often mixing in my apartment (I've found that boxers and a t-shirt are a superior choice for studio apparel).\nI'm running an Mbox2 with Pro-Tools 7 (sometimes switch to Nuendo... don't hate me... hush now Abelton users).\nI also use these with my Ivory Keys VST and it sounds pretty nice, I think they add a bit of warmth when compared to a set of Mackies, could be the spatial difference, but I actually like it better through the Senns, a bit more personal I guess.\n\nThat said, I feel pretty happy with the sound from these cans.\nI've been using them for almost a year now, extensively.\nThey're a bit lacking in the low-ends when I push them, but when you pair them up with an analyzer you can usually compensate pretty nicely with a combo of visual and audio reference.\n\nThey are open-ear, so don't expect your vocalists to be using them in the sound booth or you'll be recording the sound coming from the headphones along with the vox. For the producer, the only real place for these is in the mix down if you're trying to be quiet... or your one of those weirdos who uses cans for some bizarre voodoo mixing ritual.(I've heard of these guys but never met one)\n\nThey are definitely more comfortable than some of the other headsets I've tried, Grado's being the least comfortable, Sony's aren't bad.\nSometimes I seem to put them on wrong and my ears start hurting pretty quickly but if I slide them around on my head a bit so my ears are good and centered I can wear them for a few hours before I need to take em off.\n\nI think the most important thing to note here is my experience with Sennheisers customer service.\nRecently I snapped the headset in half, dunno if it was from cheap plastic construction or just lots of use. Regardless I contacted Senn and asked what I needed to do, assuming I'd have to send them in and wait a week to get them fixed. Instead Senn offered to just send me a new headband and I could replace it myself.\nBecause of the modular construction of these cans that will be pretty easy to do and lets me keep using them while I wait for my replacement.\nNeedless to say, that made me pretty happy.\nThe cords firmly snap in and out of the cans via 2 pronged plugs, nice for those who accidentaly step on the cord while they stand up.\n\nOn a consumer level note, if you are listening to MP3's or any compressed audio format in a portable device... or any device for that matter, don't buy these, you're wasting your money.\nI'm not insulting you, I'm being serious.\nThere are cheaper alternatives for compressed audio.\n\nIf you like your music and can't blast your speakers for some reason or the other, then I'd say these are a pretty nice set. Not the best for sound but close enough that the price and comfort make up for the slight difference you may hear in a set of (very uncomfortable) Grado's.\n\nFor those of you who are worried about reproducing the ""original sound"" of a recording, you need to laugh at yourself for a minute and realize that we process those sounds pretty thoroughly before we even bounce them to a track. Compressors, EQ's, Verbs, etc., sometimes before the signal even hits the sound card it's gone through a pre-amp. Aside from that the difference between audio still in the DAW and a bounced track is pretty dramatic. You're just not going to hear what we hear in the studio. Go with what you like.\nSome like it crispy, some like it warm.\nIf you can listen to your favorite track through the headphones before you decide to buy them, do that.\nLeave em on your head for a while see how they fit.\n\nI recommend trying them out if your searching for a set.\nThey work nicely for my purposes.";Good set for mixing and portable studios.
7;19.0;3.0;10.0;"""Flat"", my ass. they are WARM, kinda muddy with a chance of meatballs i.e. hyped 100-200Hz with top-end rolloff. I'm an independent music producer and mix engineer so my perspective is not audiophile or consumer, rather it is ""representation of what I think the music should sound like."" If that sounds biased, it is, biased by a lot of listening, making commercial/pop music, and teching gear for 20+ years.\n\nSignal path for both: Spotify premium >cheap PC soundcard >o2 headphone amp\n\nvs Beyer DT880 600ohm , these have :\n- less 40Hz\n- way more 60-200Hz\n- more or less similar freq resp (different imaging) in the mids\n- way less 4k-15k\n\nThe Senn600's sound just like the 650's I bought 2-3 years ago, and later sold (warm & ""smooth"" & enjoyable, but not enough detail for mixing). People who are splitting hairs between these 2 models have nothing better to do.\n\nSoundstage i.e. the ambient experience here is close and tight, like most traditional headphones, overly sensitive to panned instruments. ENTIRELY different vs the overly open soundstage and clarity of reverbs etc of the 880s. When guitars are panned hard L/R in the Senn's, that's what you hear: 2 clear sources, panned hard. Perhaps not as musically enjoyable as a more active soundstage, but it is ""accurate"" to the mix. Remember, the track was probably mixed on speakers in a room, not on headphones thus SHOULD sound overly defined in ""accurate"" headphones. +1 for Senn soundstage simplicity & accuracy, -1 for boring\n\nThe Beyers create an airy, immersive, bubblebath soundstage around you. From low mids to high mids it is as luxurious as the felt pads on your ears and reveals tons of detail (too much, wait for it). They also hit you in the sub quite easily. However it would be DIFFICULT to hear and transcribe a bass line using these, as there is little representation of the most pitched notes of a bass guitar (~60Hz -250hz)  +1 for Beyer mindless musical enjoyment, -1 for unrealistic imaging\n\nBeyers high end is annoying: you can quite easily hear whether something was recorded to tape or to some digital method. Many Top40 hits that I thought everywhere else in life sounded pretty good showed their true colors with obvious grainy shrill constant high-end noise, revealing a nasty harshness that you're not going to ever hear in your car or maybe even your earbuds. -1 for Beyers going too far in the high end dep't\n\nBut overall the lack of ""bass guitar"" range bass, and overstated top top end i.e. 8k-20k, had me running from the 880's. Note that I burned them in for 4-5 days of various pop music on repeat. This didn't really change their rather shrill character which was unlistenable by my tastes on modern digitally-recorded or cheaply recorded pop music. +1 for Beyers revealing the air band, -1 for it not really mattering unless you're recording Norah Jones/classical\n\nSenn for obviously muddy 100-200Hz -1\nand as many would say ""smooth"" top end (i.e. lack of detail & LPF rolloff) -1\n\nSo:\nSenn600=muddy with traditional headphone imaging. Will keep you from mixing overly muddy, but you might exaggerate top end & reverbs in the mix\n\nBeyer880=bass is pretty much a large one-note sub, but clarity in mids & highs that feels luxurious, as long as you're not sensitive to freq's above 10k, at which point any harshness like digital distortion will become distracting and possibly hurtful.\n\nHope this adds clarity to whether either of these are for mix engineers or not. Answer: NEITHER . Or, you need BOTH.\n-markus, StellarSoundLabs";Senn HD600 vs Beyer DT880 for music mixing
12;20.0;5.0;11.0;I wanted to take the leap to audiophile level headphones without breaking the bank and researched online and found that these were these were highly recommended. I was not disappointed.\n\nI bough this headphone with the schiit magni2/modi and the combo sounds fantastic. I can listen for hours and not get fatigued. The headphones are very comfortable and the sound is pleasant and neutral.\n\nI'm very happy with these headphones and would definitely recommend them.;Fantastic
67;21.0;5.0;27.0;I bought the HD600 refurbished from amazon.com and paired with a xenos headphone amp and an audigy 2ZS (unfortunately). Long story short. You need to replace 1. the stock headphone wire on this headphone and 2. buy a headphone amplifier 3. Also, though not essential, you will gain significant benefits, upgrade your soundcard to the Asus Xonar Essence ST (thereby negating the need for a headphone amplifier).\n\nIm not even kidding. I don't believe in paying big bucks for an amazing cable but there is something wrong with the wire they send you. And yes, I have ordered replacement wire for the HD600 and same problem. I can tell you there is a HUGE difference when I switched wires. All that's required is to replace it with the HD650 wire from sennheiser website and buy the gold adapter. This will actually cost LESS than 30 bucks and less than the replacement wire for the HD600. Best decision I have ever done.\n\nFirst, yes, it's a 300 ohm headphone. You will get adequate amplification out of a normal output but you will completely miss the powerful dynamic capabilities of a dedicated headphone amp and miss some low and high end extension. What The advantage is a complete lack of hiss!\nWhen I first got it for about an year I was thoroughly unimpressed with the sound. Everything sounded veiled, and the high frequencies sounded like they were very veiled. The detail of different instruments, especially quiet details seemed to be gobbled up and not properly produced. Loud sounds were harsh and strained. The detail was not much better than other headphone that cost around 60-100 dollars. However, I noted that even then the sennheissers had a high tolerance to PUSH extreme amounts of volume without clipping.\n\nThis all changed when I bought the HD650 cable based on recommendations. The low end improved and every quiet detail was bought. The headphones became airy and even with great high end extension. The strain and ear fatigue just vanished! In my opinion the quality of the sound improved by about 30-50% depending who you are and how unblocked your ears are!\nAnd the others are quite right. I can already tell that by its effortlessness these headphones will do much better with a more expensive headphone amplifier and a way better source than the audigy 2 (which admittedly is quite a good low cost card). I reccomend the Asus Xonar and a pretty expensive headphone amplifier.\n\nWith my comparison speaker current setup it has the amount of detail pumped out by a Cambridge soundworks megaworks 510D subwoofer powering two (underused) full range Mitsubishi vintage towers which contain a 2 inch tweeter, four 4 inch mid-range woofer and a 10 inch low end woofer.  I would say you would get similar detail that my speaker setup provides from a speaker combination costing anywhere between $600-1300 depending on how you shop.\n\nBass: My sub goes down accurately to 33 hz +/-3db. HD600 bests the 8 inch 180W RMS sub in terms of detail. ABSOLUTELY NO BOOMINESS in the bass. Clear defined bass  but doesn't quite hit the same low end extension and power by a significant amount. Once again, I think this is a problem with the bass control on my headphone amplifier which has a cross over of about 50-60hz which is not very low at all. I believe the sennheiser can reach a full octave lower and louder than it is hitting now upto at least 25hz with accuracy and precision.\n\nMid-range: It gets very close and in cases slightly better than even than my tower speakers. However the full range towers do provide a more pleasing and more detailed mid-range. The presence of mid-range on drum tracks are more pleasing and come through with a good punch while the sennheissers don't quite capture the power of a good mid hit on a drum. Vocal performance though does go to the HD600 with clear and high female vocals. This is saying a lot as when my speaker system is properly positioned vocals float in the middle of the air very naturally.\n\nHighs: HD600 is a clear win. The highs are clear airy and defined while my two inch tweeters come a far far distant second. On the HD600 You can hear significant differences in the cymbals on drumsets according to the song you are listening. This applies to even the egg shakers or pretty much anything in the high end. You can differentiate the timbre of the same type of musical instrument. For instance one flute can be distinguished from a different quality flute of the same kind. Same goes for guitar. Listening to jcwfree on youtube is just an absolute pleasure.\nHowever, I have to say that the HD600's attention to detail doesn't make it an ideal listening environment for Rock music precisely because the sound is so clean and clear and only produces the distortion present in the recording and nothing more. In my opinion cheaper systems that distort under strain is better suited to rock guitars.\n\nAll my mp3 listening had to be replaced to 192kbps-320 kbps because of this amazing preciseness of the HD600.\n\nThe HD600's stregnths are instrumental music. Soft rock, Jazz, and are VERY good on bluray movies. It is VERY hard to these headphones to distort. I have to push my amplifier to the limit and only then it's the low range than distorts. I listen to very loud music and have several noise complaints against me :p and this volume where it clips is too loud even for me. The sennheissers can deafen me quite easily as it stays clear and unstrained WITHOUT boominess until the loudest levels thereby you sometimes don't realize how loud they are until you take them off and go DAMN!\n\nBuild quality is very good. I've had it for three years. Stepped on it, sat on it, thrown it, dropped it from four feet, twisted the headphones (all accidentally) and this thing is no worse for the wear. Also great is that the heaphone cables split and go individually into each heaphone. The entire headphone is replaceable in parts because it is designed to be dissassembled and reassembled. The pads are replaceable all the wires are replaceable. great. Also the headphones themselves are HUGE so keep that in mind and are definitely not suitable for running as they will fly off your very easily if you shake it.\n\nThe pads are also VERY comfortable. Most comfortable headphones I've tried on and they do not feel warm.\n\nA warning though, if you buy these headphones and don't use it with a dedicated GOOD soundcard without buying the HD650 replacement cables (rather than the HD600) and without an amplifier this is what you will experience:\nDecent, unimpressive sound that can be bought by a pair of headphones well below a 100 dollars.\nThe bass is defined though not loud and has a low end extension of about 40-50hz though. Completely lacking any wow factor. The dynamics are on par with a headphone costing about 60 dollars. The high's are recessed and veiled. Everything sounds like it has a veil on it. Soft sounds don't quite get expressed very well. Dissapointing. Also the original cable is very susceptible to damage compared to almost any replacement.\n\nIf you do take the time and money this kind of headphone is meant to be paired with source equipment + amplification worth all the way upto at least a thousand dollars easily.\n\nUpdate: I just upgraded my soundcard and did a bit more research. To get the optimal sound quality for these phones, I use a mp3 software player capable of ASIO or WASAPI playback. For example: foobar with a few tweaks. WASAPI is most easily setup and works if you have vista or windows 7 (you have to use ASIO if using XP). Basically what any of these things are is a way to bypass the windows mixer which actually resamples all your audio from 44 khz upto 48khz and then resamples it back to whatever output it's supposed to be going at. This reduces the sound quality IMO by about 5 to 10%. So it bypasses this and sends the audio signal directly to your soundcard for bitperfect playback.\n\nSo I upgraded my soundcard to the Asus Xonar Essence ST and these are my impressions. There is a quality difference of about ANOTHER 30% at least. More importantly, right now the HD600 SPANKS my current sound system. Yes, this means it's bass output, mid-range output and high's. It's so ridiculous that I'm getting it out of this (relatively) cheap setup. Also, I am noticing a thing I've never heard before called SOUNDSTAGE! The mp3's sound completely different and I can actually sense the kind of room these instruments are being played in. I can hear tiny details like the soft inhalation out of the nostrils. Soft instruments play very clearly far away in the background while a deafening bass track and drums pound out the climax to a song.\nFor instance I listened to TLC-waterfalls and noticed this soft piano track playing which I'd never heard before. On Outkast's ms jackson I noticed all these voices in the background that pop in from time to time softly whispered far away. And for any kind of classical music this thing is just flat out amazing. So much detail. I always thought classical music recordings sounded dull, but oh boy, not now. These things showed me that classical music had POWER and low end! (and high end too!). I don't know how I missed that all these years. Cymbals took on a new meaning. I always assumed that if an instrument was soft it sounded like it was far away and if it was loud it would move closer on headphones. Nope. Far away instruments could get really loud but still stay far away! (I don't know how this is managed but somehow it is). I can notice other things like the singer is standing slightly left to the mike and BEHIND him is a soft violin, while close to my left ear a guitar plays a very soft tune. Audience laughter is something that also took me by surprise because it immediately gave me a sense of the size of the room and the kind of auditorium they were in. I'm shaking my head as I say this because I didn't think headphones could do this.\nAlso transient response really improved. I listened to Los lobos hotel california and some flamenco guitar tracks on this setup and on the audigy 2 it sounded very pleasing and mellow and when the guitar played fast it felt somewhat blurred together. On the xonar the guitar picks became sharp and stood out beautifully. Also when the guitar played fast every note was played out as sharp and clear as day EXTREMELY quickly. So, this just goes to show that the HD600 can really do with pairing up to some REALLY good sound sources.\nOh, and also, what bass is there on the track is there on the phones and it can get REALLY low. Wyclef Jean's gone till november or Matisyahu's live at the stubbs King without a crown put out low clear bass. On the HD600 instead of hearing the low note of the bass part of the song, you actually hear and identify clearly the INSTEUMENT causing the bass. You can even define between the different electric bass guitars effects or low kick drums used.\nSo if you are willing to spend LOTS more money after buying this headphones because you know they are not at their true potential YET, run and buy these. Sorry for your wallet :) Otherwise there are other good headphones out there that don't NEED expensive sets to sound close to their full potential and costs less like the grado SR60.\n\nOh, I listened to an ipod nano 3g using these headphones without an amplifier and they sounded decent, not very loud though and not as much detail came through as I was used to. I listened to some bose quiet comfort headphones (which I think is totally not worth the money,) and without an amplifier the Bose actually sounded comparable though at VERY loud volumes the bose distorted on the deep bass while these did not. However, in a real contest with good sources and amplification, the bose headphones were a distant loser far away on the horizon.\n\nSecond Update:\n(Granted, there is a good possibility that the limiting factor of my current headphone setup is my limiting $130 headphone amp than the headphones)\nI just got some axiom audio m80ti's with a very nice amplifier. It is with a smile that I say, I found a system that sounds better to my ears than these loyal headphones. (BTW, the comparision is unfair. 12 drivers: 4 subwoofers, 4 woofers, and 4 titanium tweeters, six tuned ports, power handling of 800 watts vs two 4 inch dynamic matched drivers, power handling of a few watts.)\nThe sound difference is significant with the axioms and more pleasing. But it doesn't diminish how much of a deal you are getting.\nA xonar essence ST (with inbuilt headphone amp) + HD600 = $400-500.\nA xonar essence + (decent amp) + M80ti's = $1700 (and all the components used were outstanding performers in their price class giving great value for money competing with systems typically worth about $3000.)\n\nThat's a price difference of over a 1000 dollars. It depends on how much you are willing to go. In terms of just headphone to headphone comparison, there are a few that compare at the price range, but just a few, and none that will soundly outperform it to a significant value...and all will most likely satisfy. I think the length and amount of time I put in this review suggest that these phones are something special. Do yourself a favor. You know you want to...\n\nUpdate 3: it's been well over six years now  having owned this. Nothing has broken except the headphone cables I mentioned. I got to put a good DAC on this and while it's not much better than the xonar essence st, I did hear some more details and spacial cues than I had from the essence. This could easily be the headphone you retire with though you will spend lots of money trying to make it sound even better or finding where it maxes out.\n\nI also compared these to the Beats headphones with which the senheissers beat (sorry, I had to) pretty much in every aspect. Also paired it to a emotiva XDA-1 dual differential DAC which has been sounding great. I have written so much about this guy mainly because of what a great deal it is. You will not find PC speakers that can compare to these things. Period.  I changed my rating from four (due to the cable) to five stars because, well, this thing is amazing, and something so small as a cable shouldnt be a factor on its exceptional rating. Im doing these updates several years later because of how six years later, I am still thrilled with these things. SIX YEARS LATER.\n\nUpdate 4: Still going strong. The only thing that has failed is the cords for them multiple times. Everything else performs like it was new and I've put it through much abuse.\nHere's the deal: this is worth it if you buy it refurbished but not for the full asking price of 400. Because of this. For it to sound fantastic you have to pair it up with great gear INCLUDING a really good headphone amp. One that has some serious power and clarity behind it. Right there yyou would spend another 300 at least on the headphone amp putting the price to around 700. There's floorstanding internet direct speakers like tekton design, axiom audio, and other rare units that are really good and simply sound better than this headphone at this price range and a little higher. So, that's my only caveat, it's hard to make these things sound sublime and that's what is irritating is that it can sound fantastic! The entry to that is rather high. So there's that.\nI plan to upgrade my DAC with a better headphone amp and when I do I shall report back. Most liklely I will be taking back my caveat. :) But for now it stands. There are audiophile grade speakers and amplifiers that if you look carefully enough that will be more pleasing on your ears especially if you look in the used market.;Is well worth it with proper equipment and at least HD650 replacement cable
31;22.0;5.0;14.0;It is hard for me to say anything bad about these headphones. Can you do better? Sure. But the performance of these cans places them in one of the best cost/performance ratios I have ever heard. They do everything exceptionally well... Do not expect them to be bass heavy. As an open backed design they are not intended to compete with the bloated bass designs that seem so prevalent today. They are very natural, smooth, and detailed, without bloat in any portion of the audible spectrum. Image is really nice, and the soundstage is convincing.\n\nI've stopped looking for cans. I am thrilled with these.;It is hard for me to say anything bad about these headphones
85;23.0;1.0;33.0;Yes, I burned them in for at least 25 hours. They sounded muddy. Smooth as caramel, but veiled. The bass was heavy and indistinct. The high frequencies were not clean, and not abundant.\n\nHaving listened to Stax headphones for years and years, I know I got used to a superclean, almost clinical sound. But still I cannot believe how completely different the HD600s were.\n\nI borrowed these from a friend, who bought them new and had hardly used them. Frankly, I get more pleasure listening with my Sony MDR-W20G sports headphones that I bought for less than $10.  I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews. I would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing. But the one I heard did not. Not even after break-in.  Never would I consider one of these phones without auditioning them. Perhaps I truly heard a rare, defective unit. But if so, both drivers were defective, because they sounded the same.;Did I get a bad sample? Totally disappointed!
26;24.0;5.0;13.0;"These headphones are game changers. I have an acoustically treated room with studio monitors. For 10+ years I refused to use headphones for listening and audio engineering as I loved the experience of the music blasting in front of me and typically would get very uncomfortable with headphones after a while (maybe I have a big head). That has all changed. Combined with my Asus Essence STX 2, these headphones brought out detail that even my studio-class monitors did not. On top of that, they're so comfortable that I started leisurely listening to all my music with them. Sitting down and listening to my old vinyl records while closing my eyes with the HD600 is an amazing experience. It's already been established just how wonderful these are for mixing and mastering music, but I wanted to emphasize that these headphones have somehow increased my already tremendously high appreciation for music. There's a reason they're so loved.\n\nA few things worth mentioning: if you do not have an amp, you'll have to move on to other options. These run at 300OHM, and will sound terrible if plugged into a casual system or MP3 player. The open back design leaks a lot of sound as well; to the point where I sometimes use the headphones as speakers when I'm too lazy to turn on my monitors. Be aware that whatever you're listening to will be audible to everyone in the room. These are hardly cons though, as these are made strictly for studio/hifi use.";Gamechanger
95;25.0;4.0;35.0;Sennheiser HD600 is one of the best headphones in the market, which offers exceptional sound quality at a price much lower than one has to pay for comparably good speakers. They are often compared to Grado RS-1 or Sony MDR-F1. Although it is extremely hard to find a place where you can compare all three of these top-of-the-line models, those people who had this chance agree that the difference in sound quality is so subtle that it is a matter of personal taste which one to prefer.\nThe sound quality of HD600 has been discussed in several reviews posted before mine. I can only add that the best way to hear the difference is to listen to the classical music or to jazz, where natural sound is paramount. Electronic music will sound good also in much cheaper headphones. There are several things which I learned from my experience that were not mentioned in reviews posted before mine:\n1. Break-in period. As taken from the box, HD600 sounded not better than $7 headphones from a local drug store, and I was very close to returning them. However, I accidentally found on the web that headphones need a break-in period, i.e., they are supposed to play for about 24 hours before they can reach their full sound potential. The sound quality transformation after the break-in period was truly amazing, and the difference between HD600 and cheap headphones became striking!\n2. With a 300 Ohms impedance, HD600 need quite some power. Neither portable CD players, nor computer sound cards can drive them - the volume is low, and the bass is gone completely. This was the only thing about HD600 that I got disappointed with - they can be used only with a dedicated high quality amplifier. It is possible that headphone jacks on DVD and CD players may also be not adequate. I ended up buying a Creek OBH-11 headphone amplifier in order to have something that can drive my HD600 and provides the sounds quality that I expected.\n3. Many people say that HD600 is very comfortable. Frankly, I saw more comfortable headphones. It may be a matter of the head size (I am a big guy), but I would be happy if the pressure on my ears could be reduced. I am getting tired of wearing HD600 after about 40-50 minutes.\nBut the sound IS great !!!;be sure to get a high quality amplifier...
8;26.0;5.0;8.0;"If hearing what the artist intended to put into their recordings is important to you, you need equipment that can squeeze those details out of the recordings.  These cans could be one important (maybe the most important) component of a system that can do that.\n\nWhat the HD600's do well is that they don't exaggerate any part of the sonic spectrum -- part of what this means is that if you are a ""bass head"" you may wish to look elsewhere.  If there is lots of bass in the source material, you'll hear it cleanly and clearly.  If it ain't there, you won't hear it.\n\nThese are over-ear, open headphones.  That means that they totally surround your ear, and that the ear cups are not sealed.  If you turn up your music enough (and it doesn't have to be much), other people can hear what you are listening to, albeit not as loudly or clearly as you can.\n\nIf you intend to use these cans in an open office environment, or to listen to music on a plane -- you've got the wrong product.  You'll need closed cans or in-ear monitors, or something with noise cancellation -- and you have lots of great options.\n\nIf you intend to use these cans in a relatively quiet place where sound leakage isn't going to bother anyone else -- now we're cooking with gas!\n\nBut that's not all.  If you plan on listening to your music off a phone or other portable device, the device won't likely be able to get your music to listenable levels.  You will require some sort of headphone amplifier to get the most of these.  In most circumstances, you will want a dedicated headphone amplifier for these.  I use a Schiit Fulla 2 as a combination DAC (digital/analog converter) and amplifier connected either to my Mac Mini or iPhone 7.\n\nBut wait...we ain't done yet.  If you are listening to digital media, you will want to make sure that your music is encoded with sufficient quality.  128kbps mp3's may not sound any better on HD600's as compared to a lesser headphone.  So, make sure your compressed music is 256kbps AIFF (the Apple format) or 320kbps mp3.  Better yet -- encode your music in either Apple Lossless or FLAC (free lossless audio codec) so you can get the most out of your source material.\n\nWhat do Sennheiser HD600's give you that lesser headphones don't?  Clarity.  Detail.  A sense of space -- a feeling that you are in the room with the musicians making the music and can hear the voices and instruments separately and maybe even from different positions around you.\n\nIf I compare these to the Sennheiser Momentum (over ear, first generation) I hear details like background vocals that are buried deep in the mix, or subtle guitar accents, the mechanical clicking of of the keys while the flute player plays a soft passage, or a singer taking a breath before the next phrase. The Momentums are great cans in their own right and can even catch some of these details, and phones and other portable devices can drive them without the aid of amplifier, but imagine that they are a pair of filtered eyeglasses that can see thousands of colors -- and that the HD600's are filtered eyeglasses that can see millions of colors -- the differences are subtle if the ""sonic colors"" are present in front of you and that you are capable of hearing them -- you can see that hyper-intelligent shade of blue with the HD600's, but it just shows up as some indefinitely pleasant shade of blue with the Momentums.  An exaggeration perhaps, but hopefully it gets the point across.\n\nBottom line, if you have the device/amplifier to drive them, the right place to listen to them, and music that is sufficiently well-encoded you will have the tools to appreciate what the HD600's have to offer.  Are HD600's the best?  Probably not, but you will be hard-pressed to do better without dropping a lot more coin.";Hearing What the Artist Intended
15;27.0;4.0;9.0;Purchased the HD600, Philips X2 and Hifiman He-400s. I kept the Hifiman's after much listening and deliberation. I wanted to like the Philips sound, but didn't. I immediately liked the HD600 for clarity, airiness, and detail at all frequencies - the highs were as clear as I've ever heard. I really appreciated their low-profile look on my head as there was no headband sticking out, and the earcups didn't extend out too far. They were also very comfortable to wear with nice cushioning and a lightweight feel.\n\nWhen I tried the Hifimans, I did not think that they looked as good because of the headband that sticks out and the hefty earcups - they aren't too stylish but I'm not totally embarrassed to be seen wearing them either. The reason I kept them was because I bought headphones with the intent of having listening experiences at home sound more realistic, and like the real thing. For a number of reasons including expense and sensitivity to loudness, I'm going to less live shows. The Hifiman's just sounded more like I was experiencing live music, so I kept them. In particular, bass and acoustic instruments reproduction is very strong and sometimes catch you off guard for sounding more like the real thing than you imagined was possible. The highs are good, but not as smooth or clear as the HD600. If you are buying just for highs, then I prefer the HD600, but for all-around sound I prefer the Hifimans.\n\nI listen mostly to Indie, Rock and Electronic.;Very Good but the Hifiman edged them out in my side-by-side audition
24;28.0;5.0;10.0;"These were my first ""serious"" headphones. I bought them about 16 years ago; back then, if you had $500 (more than $700 in today's money), they were the main  and perhaps the only  game in town. That is, aside from mega-expensive 'phones such as the Sennheiser Orpheus system and the high-end Staxes, the HD 600s were considered an ""end-game"" product, bested by none. Year after year, they'd make the Stereophile list of super audio buys.\n\nI drifted away from the high-end music-reproduction hobby over time, but recently rekindled the passion when I heard and bought a set of Audeze LCD-3f headphones. At almost $2,000, the Audeze redefined (for me) what headphones are capable of, with prodigious but well-controlled bottom-end slam, a fantastic, luscious mid-range (not that the Sennheisers ever lacked in the latter department), and airy, non-sibilant highs. I've since added two even pricier headphones to my little collection (the Hifiman HE-1000 and the Stax SR-007), and am enjoying the hell out of all three of them.\n\nSo that makes the HD 600 obsolete and inadequate, right? Surprisingly, not at all. I found them in a closet last night and spent hours listening to this late-nineties star performer.\n\nAppearance had held up well over the years. Cheap foam often turns nasty and starts to crumble in as little as four, five years, but the ear pads and driver covers on the HD 600 still looked great. Only the foam on the underside of the headband had lost pretty much all its springiness  no flaking though. I had a Diono soft wrap lying around (look for it on Amazon, under five bucks for two!) and installed it on the top of the HD 600 headband. Problem solved.\n\nThe 'phones sprang back to life with satisfying punchiness and vigor, failing at practically nothing. Vocals sounded fantastic, with that typical Sennheiser liquidity and ""realness."" Snare drums and cellos and tube-amped blues guitars, same deal. Niiice, said my brain.\n\nThese are the only dynamic 'phones I have (that is, they have drivers with magnets and moving cones, like the ones in most loudspeakers). On paper they should bite the dust against my electrostats (Stax) and planar magnetics (Audeze, Hifiman), all of which have vibrating membranes for transducers. Those membranes are just microns thick, have way less mass to move than dynamic drivers do, and thus are faster and more responsive to transients like the snap of a guitar string or the sound of a stick on a cymbal.\n\nBut the Sennheisers acquitted themselves very, very well. They still sound fast and euphonic, exhibiting a musicality that is likely unmatched by anything in their price class. Also, I actually prefer the smooth HD 600 highs over the harsh, etched top end of the HD 800, 'phones I auditioned at length recently before I sent them back, and which cost almost four times what the SD 600 does.\n\nNo, the HD 600 doesn't reach the quality level of my reference headphones. Bass is a bit flabbier and softer around the edges. The Sennheisers don't quite have the same micro-detail, or the same ability to transport me deep into the music where I can just float away on a little cloud of bliss. The HD 600s sound a little less organic and ""whole,"" less capable in the bottom register, and less forgiving of poorly recorded music. Bonnie Raitt's breathtaking ballad ""Love Has No Pride"" is diminished on the Sennheisers, as the HD 600s can be prone to a certain scratchiness in the frequency band where the upper guitar strings reside. Granted, it's technically a pretty bad recording, with lots of tape hiss and a metallic brittleness to the guitar. The Hifiman and the Audeze, though, don't hide that fact, but still manage to translate the song in a way that, to me, seems accurate, mostly uncolored, and pleasing. The Sennheisers are not as accomplished in that regard, interpreting accuracy as a license to get a little screechy, and occasionally sounding not completely coherent.\n\nThen there are the plastic materials used on these headphones, ""adorned"" with a faux marble pattern that looked a little Donald Trumpy 20 years ago  and that, like the man himself, hasn't exactly improved with age. Nuff said.\n\nRegardless of their hardly glaring shortcomings, the Sennheisers are an incredible value. When paired with a good headphone amp, they will get you most of the way along the path to sonic perfection. In fact, for most people, the HD 600s will probably be the only home-use headphones they'll ever need or want.";A classic  incredibly good for the money
6;29.0;3.0;7.0;"Disclaimer: This is my first set of headphones since my days of the walkman in the 80s.  I am a bit of an audiophile and I have a pretty capable system for vinyl and CDs/hi-rez audio.  I bought these for use on my computer for editing my vinyl rips.  I have a Schiit Modi 2 Multi-bit DAC and a Schiit Valhalla 2 tube amp powering these.  They're very decent pieces of equipment.  Anyway, I would just say that my impressions of headphone listening differ from many.  You don't get a ""soundstage"" like you get from speakers.  The sound is literally in your head.  And if the imaging is well placed, it's BEHIND your head.  It's just....weird.  And a$$-backwards.  But that in and of itself is not the fault of the HD600s - at least I don't think it is.  What is it's fault is the lack of bass.  I'd read some amazing reviews about how awesome the bass was through these.  I mean, they do kick a little, but they just don't extend nearly as low as I would have expected.  Also, the highs are a bit bright for my tastes.  If I crank them up, every cymbal crash has me reaching for the volume knob FAST.  I love the sound of crash cymbals (I played drums for 15 years growing up, so I know how cymbals should sound) but these make them unbearable in their bright attack.  The reason I'm so hard on these is I literally have better sound listening through my (cheap) Creative T40 speakers.  Yes, they lack lack the bass (it's actually teri-bad).  But the mids and highs far exceed the capability of these headphones.  And with the Schiit, they make them the schiit!  A huge jump up in accuracy from when I had my Creative Audigy Sound Card doing the DA conversion.  The Schiit took a $125 pair of speakers and made them sound like $500+ speakers.  Imaging is very 3D, the sound fuller and the timbre of instruments is almost laughably good for such a cheap pair of speakers.\n\nI compared my SACD layer of Bowie's Ziggy Stardust this weekend.  And the punch of the kick drum and slam of the snare on ""Five Years"" were much more involving through the T40s.  But what the deal breaker was is the timbre.  It sounded much more natural through my T40s.  The HD600s added an edge to it all.  Like enhanced (fake) treble.  It was very disappointing.... Each song had the same kind of traits.  All were too treble-boosted through the Sennheisers.  But in fairness, the bass was much better through them.  Although not deep.  I could go on and on but I'll quit here.";Where's the Bass Everyone is Talking About?

ATM-50 is a favorite of mine when I'm tracking but when mixing the HD600 offer a more accurate view of the sonics. The HD600 are quite bright sounding which helps reveal shortcomings in recordings.\n\nI also have the HD650 which I find more pleasant for listening to music, they have lots of high frequency response but it's not as ""pushed"" as the HD600 seem to be.\n\nThe HD600 are listed as 300 ohm headphones but I've not encountered any situation where they are not loud enough. My Soundcraft mixing console specs recommend headphones 200ohms and higher, the HD600 play very loud when connected to the console headphone amp output.\n\nI like these headphones a lot, the open air construction sounds smooth and open, much more so than with the ATM-50 which have a deeper and more punchy ""rock"" sort of sound. I like both of these models and they both have their place.\n\nWatch the price, when I bought my HD650 for around $312 the HD600 was priced at $379. A couple of weeks later the HD600 were down around $275, so their price fluctuates at times. $300 is about as much as I'd ever spend on a set of headphones regardless of how good their specifications.\n\nIf I could only buy one set I think it would be the HD600 because I like the transparency in the high frequencies for recording applications.\n\nIf I was just listening to CD's and music for fun I'd buy the HD650 because they're easier on your ears for long periods of listening.

The advantage of the 598 was being able to use them without being powered by an amp (The 598 Special Edition also comes with a shorter cable to use for portable devices too). The HD 598 is the best value bang for your buck headphones, still providing incredible natural sounds.\n\nIf you don't mind the trade off and willing to invest in an amp and want a larger soundstage experience, these will be worth the upgrade. However, if you don't want to invest in amp, the HD 598 is still definitely the way to go.\n\nThe prices on these higher end Sennheiser headphones have become way more affordable compared to years ago.\n\nCons:\n- More tighter on the head than the HD 598\n- Two wires, as opposed to having just one on the left side\n- Not for bass lovers (however, that's what you use EQ for to increase bass; the HD650 is said to have more exaggerated bass)\n- These are open-headphones to provide natural sound, so people will hear what you're listening to; they are not made for listening in public places.\n\nIf you want to be even more spoiled and have more breathing space, concert feeling, it's worth the investment. The HD600 seems to be more popular than the 650, as it provides more natural sounds.  The headphones look really nice too.\n\nIs the HD600 twice as better than the HD598? I would say no, especially since you also need to factor in the price of an amp to drive the HD600. If you're looking for your first high-end headphone, the HD598 is good enough, especially for the price. Value wise, the HD598 is the way to go. However, if price is not a factor and you really want to spoil yourself with greater surround sound, the HD600 is definitely an upgrade.\n\nBeing able to hear individual instruments and vocals with greater separation surround sound makes listening to music a real pleasure.

29;34.0;5.0;9.0;Warning: Beginning of a very expensive hobby.\n\nBeware! You're now beginning your journey of what's considered to be one of the most expensive hobbies. These headsets will show you how much detail you can actually hear from your music, but not quite enough to make you feel 100% satisfied. You will be about 90% satisfied... so that you will probably chase after that 10%. This chase will usually result in you getting more expensive amps and DACs, which will lead to getting better headphones because now you don't feel like your headphones do not benefit 100% from your expensive amp/DAC. This cycle will go on and on and on and on... so beware, buyers, and know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nA word of wisdom. If you are planning on using these with your desktop, don't bother getting expensive headphone amps / DACs. Just purchase a high end sound card (sound blaster Z cost pretty cheap. SBZ or better will have absolutely no problem driving these cans). This will save you much trouble in your quest for 100% satisfaction (Which you won't ever be able to obtain of course.... but it'll place you at about 95%. Be satisfied with it and move on).\n\nYou can do the simple calculation based on the sensitivity of this headphone amplifier, and it will show you that you do not need much power to drive these cans.

The stock cable that comes with the HD600 is a bit thin, and over time the left channel gave out. I recommend getting the stock HD650 cable, as it is much thicker and resistant to wear. Taking apart the headphone for cleaning and maintenance is a breeze. You are able to get to and take out the driver within a matter of seconds. The pads come off with just a little pull effort, and snap right back into place.\n\nSound: 8/10\n  As usual with Sennheiser, the mids are absolutely perfect. The highs are very clean and balanced with little distortion. However they eventually do roll off a bit, which leads to a lack of spaciousness that could be found in the higher-end lineup. Bass is there, only just a bare minimum, but it is tight and ""proper"". The biggest problem with the sound is that the sub has significant roll-off, which can be a turn-off for most electrical or hip-hop tracks. If that issue were fixed, it would make no sense looking any further for headphones at this price range. Again, I am not saying the sub is not there, it is just not too impressive.";8.5/10 best headphone I have had the pleasure to use.

Tried with a 600 ohm amp, and the 1000 ohm unit on the Roland VS-100.\n\nI will use them as a reference, but will not mix with them.  One thing is for certain, if your mix sounds harsh or overly bright on the HD600s, you have some major problems in the high frequencies and they need brought down.\n\nPros:  Stereo field is wide and detailed.  Comfortable to wear.  Due to the lack of high end they can be listened to for long periods without fatigue.\nCons:  No top end.  High hats disappear.  Does not handle fast, articulate metal music very well.;In that range they are the best headphones I have heard
33;37.0;5.0;9.0;"General Thoughts: Coming from the Philips X2 this headphone was full of surprises! First of all I could not detect this veil people were talking about. On various forums these can's were described as being recessed sounding; Like you were sitting in the back row at a concert. To me they were the opposite! Everything sounded very clear and crisp to my ears and I felt as though I was on stage with the musicians. These headphones were also characterized as being boring but I found that I can rock out with them! I was also surprised at how easy they were to drive. I have an O2 amp/ODAC and I rarely had to engage the high gain mode to get my desired volume. Very cool.\n\nSound: The midrange is definitely the highlight of these cans. They are in your face and will immediately grab you and pull you in! Both male and female vocals sound very good on these. If you prefer a more intimate midrange then these are the headphones for you! Bass is a bit light but not as bad as I was expecting. Still I would prefer a bit more as everything sounds somewhat thin. The treble was another surprise as I found them to be a little too shouty for my tastes; specifically in the upper midrange to lower treble. Then again I have pretty sensitive hearing so this may not be a problem for others. The sound was very clear and not lacking in energy. The soundstage though was almost practically missing! There was never a moment when a voice seemed to be shouting from across the room or from behind.\n\nComfort: The comfort was good but not great. There's definitely a clamp on these. They do get a little annoying after awhile but then again I have a big head so YMMV here. The X2's on the other hand almost disappear on my noggin'. They are easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.\n\nBuild Quality: Somewhat lacking. It feels like the plastic on the headband will crack under slightest amount of pressure. They feel very cheap to me. These headphones do not seem to be built to last and I could see myself breaking them within a few years even though I'm very careful with my possessions. If they were to fall on tile or a hardwood floor then I could see them breaking or cracking easily. The X2's on the other hand are built like a tank! You'd have to run over those with a car to damage them!\n\nConclusion: All in all these are very nice headphones. They have a reputation of being the gold standard for headphones and though I feel that's somewhat justified I still prefer my X2's. If you get the HD600's then I think you'll be pleased with them. They sound very natural but do lack a bit of the fun factor of the X2's. If you like to analyze your music or do any kind of mixing then these should definitely be on your short list! If it wasn't for the X2's then these might be my go to headphones despite their shortcomings.\n\nUpdate (2/6/16):\n\nWell it seems that my X2's bit the dust. I barely had them for 6 months when the right side driver blew. I returned them to Philips for a full refund as I was within warranty however the new version I procured sounded very little like the original. Bigger but less controlled bass, very little treble to speak of, and an even more distant midrange! Needless to say I returned them to Amazon as soon as I could! Thanks for ruining an excellent headphone Gibson!  I liked the HD600's a lot due to the naturalness of their tone but I didn't care for their somewhat lacking bass and their annoying upper mids. So I decided to give the HD650's a try considering they were very similar in tone and I was totally blown away! They had all the things I loved about the HD600's but with more bass and none of the peaky upper mids! They also have a larger soundstage though not as large as the X2's. The midrange is to die for and these are now my go to headphones for rock! Even electronic music sounds very good on them. So if you're like me and enjoy some bass with your music but still want beautiful mids then give the HD650's a try. You'll be glad you did!";These are legends for a reason!
9;38.0;5.0;6.0;Sennheiser HD 600! What is there left to say?\n\nI spent a year with a pair of Sennheiser HD 650 headphones and while they sound very pleasant and can be used for extended listening sessions without fatigue, I think the pleasant presentation comes at some cost to a neutral presentation. If you look at the InnerFidelity reviews of the HD 600 and HD 650, you can see the HD 600s have the flatter frequency response out to 4KHz. So while the HD 600 headphones cannot make poor recordings sound nicer like the HD 650 headphones can, this is a nod to the good accuracy of the HD 600s midrange and the slight colouration imbued by the HD 650s. If you like the warm sound of single-ended tube amplifier distortion, you'll love the HD 650s. Speaking of amplification, as these are 300 ohm headphones don't plan to get the best from them without a suitable amplifier. Using an Asus Xonar U7 USB DAC/amplifier (compatible with headphones up to 150 ohms) does not provide the satisfying bass of an integrated amplifier (compatible with headphones up to 2,000 ohms). (The Xonar U7 has a much quieter noise floor.)\n\nIf you prefer:\nAccuracy = Sennheiser HD 600\nPleasant Listening = Sennheiser HD 650\n\nPlease note, in practical terms the two models do sound very similar and the differences, while audible, are subtle.\n\nOverall the headphones are comfortable, of good quality and easily maintainable to address long-term wear-and-tear (earpads, etc) issues. Sennheiser has a great reputation for parts availability and there are aftermarket options for those wishing to experiment.\n\nPrevious headphone experience includes: AKG Q701 Qunicy Jones Signature, Grado SR-80 (original with Grado Cushion L), Sennheiser HD 650;The last headphones you will ever buy?
55;39.0;5.0;13.0;"Wow, It's been over a year since I started my Hi-fi journey, quite hard to believe for me. Before I owned the HD600s, I had exclusively been listening to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brainwavz-B2-Dual-Armature-Noise-Isolating-Earphones/dp/B00573S3RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brainwavz B2 Dual Armature Noise-Isolating Earphones</a>. I heard the HD600s for the first time in mid-July, and while I wasn't blown away at the first listen, I definitely knew I needed something other than the B2s, because the treble spike in the B2s was starting to get on my nerves. After doing a bit of research, I finally settled on the HD600s.\nMain equipment used in this review:\n\niPod classic 6th gen 80gb\nObjective 2\nFiio L3/L9 LOD cables\n\nMusical preferences:\nClassic Rock (Beatles, Stones, Steely Dan, ELO, CCR, ect.)\nJ-Pop/Anisong (ClariS,OPs and EDs for Anime)\nIndie (Mumford & Sons, Black Keys, Awolnation, Modest Mouse)\nClassical (Just starting out)\nJazz (Just starting out)\nMetal (Mostly soft stuff like Metallica)\nVideo Game/Anime/Visual Novel OSTs\n\nBuild Quality/Design:\n\nWhile I don't think the HD600s are built poorly they aren't the final word in build quality. The glossy plastic material used for most of the headband feels very sturdy and durable, but the black plastic surrounding the driver does not feel quite as good. That particular plastic looks cheaper, but still doesn't feel too bad. You won't break them with everyday use though.\nThe overall design of the HD600s is very good to my eyes. Most of the pictures online make the blue marble finish seem way brighter than it actually was with my unit. While they don't scream durability or style, it shouldn't be enough for you to discount them entirely yet until you hear them yourself.\nThe cable is detachable and is very good quality. I have not and will not use anything other than stock cables, as I believe they're a waste of money.\n\nComfort:\nThe HD600s are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. Although that doesn't say that much considering I haven't listened to too many cans. The clamping force is average to me, and the headband is very comfortable to me. Even though my ears and head are relatively large, I never experienced any discomfort issues. My ears also fit comfortably within the earpads. As a frame of reference, after listening to the Q701s for about an hour, the headband would start to hurt my head.\nThe velour pads are also very sturdy and don't make your ears feel hot after extended use.\n\nSound Quality:\nWell, this is the big one. So far in this review you'd wonder why anyone would ever spend $400 on a pair of headphones with average build quality and good comfort! Obviously the most important part to many of you is the sound. I will try to do my best to explain the sound, but keep in mind I haven't heard any other headphones in the price range, my closest frames of reference are $150 IEMs.\n\n-Bass:\nThe bass of the HD600s has good texture as well as extension. While sub bass is lacking, mid bass is well controlled and provides a nice punch. Bass is definitely good, although it doesn't satisfy my basshead craving. Instead, it stays relatively contained and provides a nice warmth to the sound without being anywhere close to overpowering.\n\n-Mids:\nThe mids are the focal point of the HD600s, and they are wonderful. All of the instruments sound completely natural. The timbre on every instrument sounds awesome. While with the B2s some instruments sounded a bit weird, and some not completely natural, the HD600 absolutely dominates everything I've heard to date. This is the selling point of the headphones for me. The other thing that sold me on the HD600s was the vocals. While they aren't heavily forward per se, they are very intimate and engaging compared to the IEMs I own. I will discuss vocals more in the soundstage section.\n\n-Treble:\nThe treble of the HD600s embodies a love/hate relationship I have with them. The treble is somewhat recessed compared to the mids, although there are various spikes which I find add a small amount of sparkle to the sound and also make the cymbals crash with some authority. But these treble spikes are only a couple decibels, and so the HD600s will never hurt your ears with too much treble if you're sensitive to treble spikes like I am. Obviously, the advantage to having laid back treble is the reduced chance for fatigue after long listening sessions as I have noted above. However, the treble is also not as detailed as other headphones that have a more balanced treble.\n\n-Detail:\nWhen listening to the HD600s, I often struggle to find microdetails in recordings such as when the vocalist takes a breath, but instrument detail is fairly well done. While I find this somewhat annoying, I find myself not paying too much attention to the small details nowadays, and instead listening to the bigger picture.\n\n-Soundstage:\nThe HD600s are obviously open backed, so the soundstage isn't bad. While I never got the feeling that the sound was too far away from my ears, I don't feel that the soundstage is closed in at all. The soundstage is better than any of the IEMs I have tried. I also feel that the center stage is very well done. Vocals and instruments that are supposed to be in the middle of the soundstage sound much more intimate and engaging than anything I have previously heard. Overall the soundstage is above average, but still not perfect.\n\nMusical Pairings:\nThe HD600s sound awesome with just about any genre you throw at them, whether it be electronic or jazz. The only area the HD600s lack in is genres/songs with a lot of sub bass, which is relatively quiet.\n\nClosing Thoughts:\nThese headphones are simply excellent any way you look at them. While the build quality might not meet military standards, they should last you a long time. Besides, you weren't planning on taking your open back HD600s into combat with you, were you?";Simply amazing sound quality for the money!
98;40.0;4.0;23.0;"I love these headphones. They're light, good looking, and sound great. I can wear them at work all day with no fatigue or stress.\nMy one complaint with them is one I have with all Sennheiser  headphones; the jacks that connect the cable to the headphone eventually get loose, causing the earpieces to cut out. I use dielectric tune-up grease to keep the connection, but I  wish Sennheiser would fix this problem.\nOther than that, they're great headphones.";A very nice, clear set of headphones.
52;41.0;2.0;12.0;Unfortunately, it is not just the sound that one must use to judge a headphone.  The construction is very important. Why?  Because you inevitably throw them around in various ways.  You cannot be careful all the time.  And you may not be the only one who uses the headphone.  They inevitably fall down, or the cleaning lady does something.  This headphone has one of the most fragile holder pieces for the earpieces that I have seen.  Look closely at the construction, and notice the plastic U shaped holder that actually holds the ear piece.  It is very fragile.  If you break the holder, you can try super glue to repair, but that tends to be temporary.  Other fine headphones use metal, or Grado has an alternative design.  When my holder piece broke, the company charged me $150 to repair this vital item, which is so fragile and which does not lend itself to easy repair.  That is why I rate the headphone down.  The basic design has not changed in many years, and it surely needs to be upgraded.  Perhaps with a poor review the company will get the message.;Poor Construction mars very good headphone
13;42.0;3.0;6.0;I hate giving these headphones a 3 star rating. I've been enjoying the HD600 since I received them at the beginning of Feb. 2016, but as of today I can't hear anything out of the left speaker.\n\nI've used them as my daily driver, so it's unfortunate I have to put them to away. They're extremely comfortable and the neutral, quality sound they produced was unequaled by any other headphones I've tried in the past. That said, spending another $300 on a pair of headphones that only managed to last 7 months of use isn't something I could recommend to anyone.;Fantastic sound quality, but very short lived.
51;43.0;1.0;11.0;"UPDATE #2:  I sent the headphones to Sennheiser for repair.  After ""repair,"" the phones exhibit the same problem.  I will contact Sennheiser again because I think it's unacceptable for $400 headphones to have this problem.\n\nUPDATE:  I decided that the creaking was intolerable.  I tried to make a return through Amazon, but that window had closed.  So now I have initiated a repair at Sennheiser, as I think there is a manufacturing defect.  Very disappointing.\n\nWhen I looked more closely at the problem, I saw that most of the noise comes from the two joints where the earpads meet the headband.  Those joints are designed to rotate slightly.  The rotation should be smooth (as it is on my HD580s), but in this case there are about 12 little hiccups in the rotation on each side.  The joints are grinding, and each stutter in the rotation translates as a creak.\n\nINITIAL REVIEW:  I have been using the HD600 for a few weeks, and am disappointed to find them more than a little annoying, unlike my HD580 pair.  First, they seem too tight & press too hard around my ears.  I have tried bending them wide open (carefully), but that hasn't improved how they feel.  Second, there is a lot of structural noise conveyed into my head through my bones -- noise from the ear pads and from the headband.  If I yawn with them on, there's a little cascade of noise. If I move my head at all, there is noise.  The tight fit may be exacerbating this.  I am wondering if different ear pads would improve the situation.  Maybe memory foam?  I don't recall that other people reported this problem, so I'm surprised by it.  It is really distracting, and it's not what I expect from a $400 set of headphones.";Lots of creaking noise (& the fit is a bit uncomfortable)
17;44.0;3.0;6.0;"These sound fantastic.  More natural, clear and detailed than the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro & 990 Pro's I've been using for years.  The frequency response is also much smoother in comparison to the B's.  Listening to high quality music, films and games with the HD 600s is so much more immersive as it feels like I'm in it, rather than having it projected at me, which is exciting and something I wish I had experienced sooner.  However the great sound is where the party ends with *stock* HD 600's.\n\nThese are uncomfortable.  Straight out of the box these things squeezed my head like I owed them money.  Two weeks later - after having a yoga block wear them overnight - the clamping force has gone down a *bit*, but the ear pads are still digging into my head.  The upper cheek bone near my ear canal aches as I write this, but is tolerable in comparison to the headband on these headphones.  These don't have a $400, $300 or even $100 (the Beyerdynamics are $100-$150) headband.  The headband is so poor that if I actually first handled these in person I wouldn't have made the purchase.  It's so bad that when they showed up I had to double check Amazon and Sennheiser's website for photos to verify that I wasn't holding some bootleg cans.  The cheap, plastic headband employs just four thin, tiny bits of foam to rest on the head.  Not even memory foam or some other kind of gentle but responsive material, just thin little strips of generic foam wrapped in polyester that, even after just 15 minutes, dig into the top of my head like a noogie that won't stop.  These are uncomfortable to wear for any reasonable amount of time, and downright painful after a short while.  I can't imagine how bad it gets when the foam wears out.  Really disappointing.\n\nSo the sound is awesome but the initial comfort rivals a batting cage helmet.  What I ended up doing with great, near-OEM success was taking the factory foam out (it slides out as a replaceable strip) and putting a spare Beyerdynamic DT 770/880/990 Pro headband pad around the plastic of the HD 600's.  It completely saved the day.  The upgraded padding surrounds the stock plastic perfectly (if you didn't know any better you'd think they came like this) and the difference in comfort is night and day.  You can find cheap versions that'll also work here on Amazon or on fleaBay for about $12.  More time and money spent on top of an already pricey set of headphones is something to consider (and it may not even end up being comfortable enough for you), but it's been a must for me to even use these.\n\nThe design of these is ages old now but I think Sennheiser would do well to release a ""601"", ""Mark 2"" or something with actual comfort in mind.  Same drivers, same ear technology, just an improvement on the comfort.  Many of their other headphones - including cheaper options - have better builds.  If these were actually comfortable out of the box the HD 600s would be a 5 out of 5 no-brainer for any musician, music or multimedia fan but stock, as-is, without any modifications is 3 stars max.  Because what good are amazing-sounding headphones if it actually hurts to even wear them?";Amazing sound, terrible comfort.
25;45.0;2.0;7.0;Listened for a few days and decided to return these. On the plus side, they do sound better than my Bose noise cancelling headphones, but that's probably not saying much. I'm disappointed by:\n\n1) Comfort - They are too tight and squeeze your head (not adjustable)\n2) Bass - I understand these are supposed to be accurate without having more bass than was intended in the music, but when you listen to something called Bass Cannon and still hear almost no bass there's a problem.\n3) Appearance - They look like $30 gaming headphones, no style at all\n\nNote, used these with a Schiit Modi 2 DAC and Schiit Magni 2 Uber headphone amp.;Lack of bass, comfort, and looks
84;46.0;5.0;18.0;Got these headphones 4 years ago for $200, and have since used them constantly.  Not only are they built to last, but if something does break, you can replace it.  For example, my devil-cat bit through the cord a few weeks ago, so I ordered a replacement cord(Silver Dragon) that can be installed by anyone in a few minutes.  Needless to say, the sound is incredible, and the pads are so soft that I can wear them for hours at a time.  There are many replacement accessories for audiophiles, so the sky's the limit.  The marble-swirl finish on the outside is also a nice touch.  If you wear headphones a lot, you really owe it to yourself to get the best!;Worth every penny
91;47.0;5.0;19.0;"One size rarely fits all, and these 'phones are no exception.  They are a bit like a race horse - a bit picky about care and feeding, but with the right diet a superb performer.\nCompared to my old Grado SR60s, the HD600s need more power to play at a given sound pressure level.  They are ruthlessly revealing - badly recorded tracks sound, well, badly recorded.  Finally, the wisdom on the audio fanatic message boards is that they take time to break in, and I'm finding that they're sounding better and better with more hours on them.\nThe flip side is that when you feed them good source material through a clean amplifier (as I write this I'm auditioning a Rega Ear), the HD600s cook.  You can find yourself with tinnitus after a long session as the volume knob creeps up without the normal distortion cues to back off in the danger zone.  Everyone's head and ears are different, obviously, but I found the ear cups the most comfortable I've worn.\nIt's enlightening to hear the music without any room interaction - no bass reinforcement at your listening room's hot spots, but also no physical ""slam"" from your body's interaction with loudspeaker-driven signal.\nOverall, I'm impressed.  Unfortunately, the price point seems to have crept up, so it's not a causual purchase, and then there are the ancillary commitments - don't expect these thoroghbreds to perform to their limits off a portable CD player or similar device.  But if you're committed to high-end semi-private listening, this product joins a very short list of elite contenders for your consideration.";"Called ""professional"" for good reason"
10;48.0;5.0;5.0;They are heaven for your ears. Went from Hifiman HE 500s to these and what can I say. There are almost no trade offs with the HD 600. You get everything, great mids, highs and a good low end that is not sloppy in any way. They are extremely light which makes them very, very comfortable. Comfort is huge for me, as the HE 500s made my neck sore to the point where I didn't want to use them for fear of the pain coming back. I am using the HD 600 with a Schitt Jotunheim amp/dac and the combo has been excellent. The HD 600 will always be in my possession.;Perfect (almost)
21;49.0;5.0;6.0;These are fantastic headphones. Everything about them is awesome. Mids are crystal clear and crisp. Bass is amazing for open back headphones, and the treble is top tier. I paired them with my Schiit Magni 2/ Modi 2 and they work perfectly together. Would recommend 100%, worth every penny. For $350 they are a steal!;Best headphones under $400
11;50.0;5.0;5.0;"The Sennheiser HD 600 has been an industry standard for a number of years. I purchased the last HD 600 nearly 8 years ago and have purchased a new one now. Although there has not been sufficient time for burn-in the phones are superbly accurate (especially in the midrange: vocals, woodwinds, etc.) as well as in the wonderfully detailed highs (in an odd turn of events I happened to find that the HD 600 was not much less in the highs than my Koss electrostatics). This pair has excellent bass down to 22hz (lost it there) -3db under 70hz. The bass has more impact. Not made for ""bass-heads"", it's clean superb bass is grand. The highs are pristine, string ""sheen"" is superb-the 600 has about all you could want from a headphone. Note: If you wear them a lot I suggest you purchase new head pads and cord once a year as this wonderfully soft material wears down with heavy use. The HD 600 provides an ""in the concert hall"" sound, good sound stage. Have never ever heard or read an unkind word about the HD600s. They are a wonderful (open back) phone and although my 8 year old pair work splendidly am glad to have a tighter ""fit"" back again.l";Industry Standard for a Reason....
88;51.0;5.0;18.0;I recently came across a great deal on Sennheiser HD 600 headphones. These little beauties list for something like... but can be found for a whole lot less if you shop around. When I finally came across a set in my price range (a way whole lot less) I jumped at the chance.\nMy first impression was quality. The HD 600s come in a well constructed and cushioned jewel box of a case suitable for daily storage. The headphones themselves are attractive and of carbon fiber construction. Like all great headphones the HD 600s are of an open design. That means that outside noise will get in and enough sound will escape to possibly disturb those around you. The upside is that an open design prevents resonance distortion from within the headphones themselves. The HD 600s are also a delight to wear. They are light and comfortable enough to wear for hours and even forget that you're wearing them.\nLet me be clear, HD 600 is dead-on accurate and precise with outstanding detail and airiness. In my opinion there isn't anything better (for under...anyway) for listening to all flavors of good music - from a well made recording. The HD 600's will bring out every nuance and detail, and in all probability you'll hear stuff that you'd never known was there. On the other hand a bad recording will be unmasked and sound horrible. Every flaw will become glaringly apparent. Mannheim Steamroller's Fresh Aire III (my favorite test) came to life with a musical quality and airiness, and a solid yet undistorted punch on the drum beats you rarely get from headphones. I've been listening to this album for twenty years and I've heard things with the HD 600's that I hadn't heard since I moved from high quality vinyl to CDs. Equally important AC/DC's Highway to Hell had vigor and life, and Jewel's incredible voice sounded, well - incredible.\nTwo other old favorites, Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water, and Ted Nugent's Stranglehold, displayed way too many flaws to really enjoy. Although the HD 600 is fully capable of deep bass, music that depend primarily on a driving bass just really doesn't cut it on headphones.  That's my opinion anyway.\nIf you're looking for something for your portable or to listen to low quality MP3s keep looking. The HD 600 is way too inefficient to be powered off of a portable (try the HD 497 or Grado S60) even with most readily available portable headphone amplifiers, and way too accurate to listen comfortably to a crappy low bit rate MP3. On the other hand high bit rate MP3s sound pretty good, at least to my ear.\nAnother word about the source. While the HD 600s sounds wonderful from my mid-range receiver, I can't help but think that they will sound even better driven from a specialized audiophile grade headphone amplifier.\nI would classify the HD 600's as a great general purpose and classical/new age headphone that can also deliver on rock and roll. I've read that the similarly priced Grados might be slightly better at rock - bottom line I haven't tested the Grados, but I am impressed with the Sennheisers.\n\nThe Sennheiser HD 600s come standard with a two year warranty, that Sennheiser currently extends at no cost to five if you've purchased them through an authorized dealer.;Outstanding Detail and Airiness
22;52.0;5.0;6.0;"I'm not a total audiophile, whatever makes someone an audiophile.  I don't have a lot of money to throw at products, to figure out what sounds best to my ears.  My first kind of pricey headphone purchase was a set of Grado 325s.  I thought, and still think, they sound swell and I enjoy the soundstage but they sound so tinny with ear-piercing highs.  And no, they are not comfortable at all, becoming fatiguing to both inner and outer ear at around an hour or so.  After reading some super reviews I purchased the Audio Technica ATH-M50x (yes, the super-cool blue and copper colored ones).  After some burn-in time I was thinking that these are on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, with lows coming in at around 45% of the sound coming through, mids at 20%, and highs at 35%.  A little too bass-y for my taste, though overall more pleasing to my ears in all ways than my Grado 325s.  What I found missing was the soundstage of the Grados as the M50x is a closed-back headphone.  Indeed, the ATs actually seemed to sound best, oddly enough, with my iPhone 6S Plus driving it.  Additionally, I have a crappy pair or Bose bluetooth headphones and in-ears, Shure SE215s, and RHA t20i's (the RHAs slightly besting the Shures) but I mention this solely so whomever reads this can see where I'm coming from listening-wise.\nSo for my set up I have a 2015 MacBook Pro pushing sound through a HiFiMan EF2A tube amp/DAC, connected via USB. In addition I have a Dragonfly v. 3 DAC, but I am not utilizing it at this time, as the Sennheiser require an amp, while the other headphones I listed (to my ears anyway) seem not to.  The music I am listening to...The Beatles ""Abbey Road"" and Pink Floyd ""Wish You Were Here"" on CD, and also FLAC files of Bjork ""Biophilia"" and The Lumineers album of the same name.  I have also listened to numerous recordings from my iTunes account at 256 kbps (go ahead and sneer, audiophiles...my HD album collection is just beginning), Lana Del Rey's ""Honeymoon"" and Metallica's black album, for example.  The Senns handled everything I threw at them beautifully, without sounding muddy or exhaustingly high-pitched.  I can tell some difference between the higher and lower-quality recordings, but the HD 600s make even the lower-quality recordings sound better than my other headsets.  The Sennheisers strike the perfect balance of tonality for me, and have an amazing soundstage.  I can't say how they sound compared to other headphones costing much more, but I personally feel I have finally found the headphones that I can be happy with (they're even comfortable!) and will not be searching any longer.";Finally found a great set of cans!
48;53.0;5.0;9.0;"My new HD600 arrived with the sound cutting in and out on the right side. I feared I would have to exchange them but Googled for the problem and came across the Head-fi guide which said this:\n\n""Troubleshooting/Known Issues:\nSome HD 600s are known to ship with the cable inserted loosely. This can cause the sound to cut out of either side when the cable is moved. To fix this, push the cable in hard, not just a little hard, but push it in with the angry fist of a god hard. Once it's in hard, it should stay that way on it's own.""\n\nSure enough when I pushed the cord in hard on that side, it moved further in by almost 2mm, and the sound has been rock stable ever since. I wonder how many people return or exchange these thinking they are faulty when all it would take is one good hard push to seat the cable properly!\n\nNow onto the brief review...\n\nSound: These headphones produce the most natural sound that I have experienced from headphones.  Nothing is exaggerated.  The mids are beautiful.  Vocals sound incredible.  Highs are less sparkly or less harsh depending on your perspective.  Bass is a bit loose when plugged directly into my Macbook Air or phone but tightens up considerably with my Schiit Asgard 2  amp.  These shine on just about any genre with the exception of the sub-bass being inadequate for a small subset of my rap and electronic music (but still great on most rap and electronic and virtually all rock, pop, jazz, funk, soul, classical).  I don't hear quite as much detail with these as with my Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro (250 ohm), but there is plenty of detail there, and I wouldn't call them veiled.\n\nBuild: Light, seems solid, fully modular with parts available for replacement.  Cable is very long, thinner/lighter than some of my other headphones, and seems to resist tangling.  Cable can be replaced like everything else.  Very comfortable on my big head and ears though not quite as comfortable as my Beyerdynamic DT770 and DT880.  The Beyers totally encircle my ears, hardly touching them.  The HD600 is more snug, touching all the way around.  The marbled finish looks okay in person.  From the pictures, I thought it was going to look terrible.\n\nMost headphones in my collection and nearly all popular headphones these days have a V-shaped sound, emphasizing bass and highs.  The HD600 are a wonderful contrast to that, with an overall neutral signature and the gorgeous mids.";The Natural
42;54.0;5.0;8.0;"Well this is the first real pair of headphones I've owned. Previously I wasn't too serious about headphones and had purchased some SOL Republics over-the-ear headphones. There was a customer service guy that recommended them among others like Skullcandy and other sub $150 non-audiophile headphones saying that ""All these headphones are pretty good, just don't buy Beats or your just paying for the name"". Well at the time I thought the Republics sounded good for music like Rage Against the Machine. But after I purchased some quality NHT Superzero bookshelf speakers for my office I noticed that the headphones were completely missing the higher frequencies. Boosting the Highs on an Equalizer helped but it still had a muddy sound to them. So I decided to try some more serious higher priced headphones and see what happens.\n\nI already had a decent Peachtree Audio Integrated Amp/DAC with headphone amp to test them. So as I sat in front of my bookshelf speakers, I plugged them into the headphone amp. I wasn't that blown away thinking the HD 600s sounded slightly better than my other headphones but certainly not worth the extra $250 Dollars. However I noticed right away details in music that I'd never noticed before. Like clearly hearing the squeaking chair of a producer at the beginning of The WHO's 'Don't get Fooled Again'.  I let them keep playing music and burn themselves in while I did something else for about 4 hours. When I came back the bass response was noticeably better and sound was slightly improved but still felt it was not that great of an improvement.\n\nThen I had an major facepalm moment when I realized I was comparing these headphones to my bookshelf speakers. They sounded so much like them that I didn't even realize that I had the memory of the bookshelves sound in my head and not the other headphones. I had been listening allot to my main speakers and not much to my other headphones so that must be why. Needless to say I was pretty impressed when I realized my error. Kind of hate to admit that they sound a little better than my main speakers. The bookshelfs have a slightly darker sound and have a somewhat boosted bass by default that I don't care for. So then I compared the actual other headphones and as I expected muddy bass, missing highs and mediocre at best sound. The other headphones also had a very noticeable noise floor. On the HD 600s there is absolutely NONE! Any background noise you notice through the headphones is either due to the recording itself or the source your hooking it up to. This is great because you can listen to music at low volumes and still clearly hear the music without fuzzy noise interfering.\n\nI was surprised also that my phone was even able to drive these headphones to a respectable medium volume. I expected the volume to be allot lower considering the 300 Ohms rating. However you need an amp to get loud enough to get the full details of the music and the phones amp doesn't have the separation of instruments like my home headphone amp. The Bass and Treble don't fully emerge until you get to a loud volume and I mean LOUD. These can be fatiguing if you want to hear all the details of the music because I find the volume has to be fairly loud to reach 100% potential. Just listen to these at medium volumes compared to loud volumes and you will be shocked. There is a sweet-spot with these headphones for sure. It is great for easy listening 'classical' music, acoustic with vocals, symphonies, light rock etc. People saying the bass is too light on these have got to be kidding. I use a Peachtree Audio Amp and DAC which is considered to be neutral by many and at louds volumes it can be a little overbearing on bass-heavy songs. At low volumes I'd agree that the bass is a little light but so is the treble. It has a good punch without taking over and overwhelming your ears. Not flat in anyway whatsoever.\n\nDefinitely find Open headphones to sound better without the boxed-in sound of a closed headphone. Yes you can't use them in a quiet room when someone is sitting next to you. But what I like is that you can still somewhat hear what is going on around you if you are not listening at too loud of a volume. I'm a mail carrier that cases mail for hours a day before delivering. So at work I can listen to music at low volumes without someone having to throw something at me to get my attention. I much prefer it to closed headphones in situations like these where you are not concerned about critically listening and just want some background music to pass the time. These headphones are also very comfortable and feels like your wearing earmuffs when they are on. My entire ear fits in the headphone without touching the sides of the enclosure, so rarely get soar even after several hours of use. They clamp a bit tight on your head at first but eventually get stretched out and loosen up over time.\n\nNot a fan of the headphone cable that comes with the HD600. After only one week of use and trying to be careful, the headphone signal was cutting out when I flexed the cable. The cable is so thin and cheap and not deserving of these high quality cans. I'm not one of those people that says cable will change the audio quality but it has to at least be built well enough to withstand normal wear and tear. I upgraded to the HD 650 cables which are almost twice as thick and much more respectable. Although it has a 1/4"" plug instead of the 3.5mm plug from the original cable, so you need an adapter for that too. Be prepared to spend about another $25 dollars though on top of your $400 dollar investment(Much cheaper now I guess). I almost wanted to dock a star just for the poor cable but ultimately it's one speedbump in a field of positives.\n\nThese headphones can't match the physical feeling of sound vibrations hitting your body from big speakers. However the big speakers can't match the detail the HD 600s give you being right next to your ears either. Unlike stereo systems with subwoofers needing room equalization and treatment, all you have to do it is put these headphones on for near perfect sound. There is no boominess to the bass and it's very fast and tight. The bass is not overpowering and just right. While the Highs sound very crisp and detailed. Vocals are very lifelike. Nora Jones has never sounded better.\n\nLast but not least these are made in Ireland! Good to know there are still SOME electronics not being made in China. I have no problem paying a premium for something that wasn't made in a sweatshop. You don't need to spend $1,000+ dollars on an Amp/Dac to reach these phones potential despite what people tell you. I use an Objective2Amp/DAC Combo that has really low distortion and doesn't color the sound like many Amps Do and it sounds brilliant. I'm not someone that buys new headphones every month and was looking for a great headphone that would last several years. Hopefully this is the one. :)\n\n1/26 Update: I've discovered after listening to these for awhile that I was actually pushing these headphones too loud. Apparently these headphones are EQed for a more distant mellower sound instead of being loud and in-your-face like headphones I was used to in the past. The bass was not strong until I had the volume very loud and then the treble was almost ear piercing. But if I listen at more moderate volumes the bass is not quite as present but blends with with treble perfectly. There seems to be a pretty small window for the volume not being loud enough, to being to loud to get a full clear sound. The default flat settings are not really suited for music with electric guitar as it sounds a bit faint. It's more for relaxed listening when your browsing webpages on your computer or just listening to musical instruments/vocals. Which is Ok with me but thought I'd tell others so they should know what to expect. You'll just need to change Equalizer settings if you want a more aggressive neutral sound. I like switching between the default warm sound and more bright sound depending on the music.";Amazingly Crisp and Clear

23;56.0;5.0;6.0;First experience with a high dollar set of headphones. Every time I put them on whether it be to watch a youtube video, play a game, or listen to music, it is always mindblowing to hear the level of detail that you get with these headphones.\n\nI would definitely recommend to you if you love to sit and listen to music at home. My favorite thing to do with these is to kick back in a recliner and listen to an album like Closer to The Edge by Yes. I have them paired with a schiit stack (modi 2 uber/ magni 2) and it provides tons of juice to these headphones and they will need it as they have a higher resistance than a lot of other headphones.\n\n10/10 glad I made this impulse purchase.;I would definitely recommend to you if you love to sit and listen ...
81;57.0;5.0;15.0;"The Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I've always been satisfied with merely ""decent"" audio.  Until now.\n\nI'd previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that's now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it's time to rip everything into lossless format.\n\nI cannot recommend these headphones more highly - they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality, though, life's going to get a lot more expensive, as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.\n\nStill, this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow!";Sonic Delight!  But... a Warning!
83;58.0;5.0;15.0;Having been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\n\nEach time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher.\n\nWhether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n\nThe reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song.\n\nIt gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n\nWhen you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass.\n\nCan I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.\n\nAlbums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\n\nIsao Tomita's The Firebird (1976)\nGeorge Harrison's eponymous album (1979)\nSteely Dan's Gaucho (1980)\nJoe Walsh's The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get (1973)\n10CC's The Original Soundtrack (1975)\nGodley & Creme's Consequences (1977)\nSupertramp's Crime of the Century (1974)\nXTC's Black Sea (1980)\nPeter Gabriel's 3rd album (1980)\nKate Bush's The Dreaming (1982)\nEarth Wind and Fire's All 'n' All (1977)\nLevel 42's The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)\nBilly Cobham's Spectrum (1972)\nFrank Zappa's One Size Fits All (1975)\nRingo Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974)\n\nand a truly incredible sounding album from the 90's, Prince and The New Power Generation's ''Symbol'' album from 1992.\n\nAlbums NOT HD-600 friendly:\nTodd Rundgren's Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)\nBlue Oyster Cult's Agents of Fortune (1976)\nPaul McCartney's Venus and Mars (1975 - and quite a few others)\nJohn Lennon's Imagine (1971 - and avoid 1970's Instant Karma like the plague, the piano track will hurt you . .  )\nYes's Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\n\nand surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain't broken.\n\nIf you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600's that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.;Sennheiser HD-600
63;59.0;4.0;11.0;"I have owned Sennheiser's HD555s since 2006. So after 5 years I decided I wanted a bit of an upgrade. By the way - as a sidenote - if you're buying your first pair of ""good"" headphones I would HIGHLY recommend the 555s (although I believe they've been recently replaced by the 558). It's a very good upgrade from cheap headphones and it certainly won't break the bank.\n\nAs for the 600s: I made the plunge and spent what I consider to be an outrageous amount of money on sound (I also purchased the FiiO E9). Overall I spent around $500 on this. Was it worth it? I'm not sure - but I certainly love the sound I get out of this setup. It's interesting though: I didn't really appreciate the sound at first (even after burn in) and I was frustrated that I had spent so much money on the equipment. But when I tried using my HD555s again they sounded TERRIBLE. And that's saying something because the 555s were headphones that had treated me very well for five years. The analogy I'd make is similar to the switch from VHS to DVD. When I watched my first DVD 11 years ago I didn't really see what all the fuss was about. I didn't really see the difference...call me blind I guess. But after watching a bunch of DVDs, switching back to VHS to watch a movie made the difference much more apparent. THEN I started to appreciate the DVD quality.\n\nIf you have money to spend and have already had HD555-tier headphones for a while then I'd say that you should get these. They sound a lot better than the 555s. However, make sure you have decent quality music or they will exaggerate the ""bad"" in the quality. I had to get new versions of a few songs because of this. Most of my music is 200-300kbps and it sounds fine. I don't claim to have super-hearing so I never bothered to get straight 320kbps MP3s or FLAC files. The 250kbps sounds just fine for me.\n\nYou should be aware that these headphones leak WAY more sound than the 555s. It's a bit frustrating (I'm in a college environment) but it's okay. All my friends make fun of me for it (""WHY DO YOU HAVE HEADPHONES INSTEAD OF SPEAKERS IF THEY'RE BOTH LOUD?!?"" haha). It's alright though.\n\nFinally, make sure you get an amp. I like the E9 but have nothing to compare it to.\n\nComfort: 8/10 (very comfortable but they're significantly tighter than the HD555 if you've ever tried that one)\nSound quality: 10/10 (as reference, I'd say the 555s are a 6/10)\nBang for buck: 7/10 (they're damn expensive, and there's no getting around that)";It's annoying to switch back to the HD555s...so it must be good, right?
39;60.0;2.0;7.0;I had to return these. Unfairly praised headphones from a cheapskate company. I tried to like them but the driver is the same too small 30mm junker they use in their cheaper headphones too. 1-1.5k is too steep for a decent pair of headphones Sennheiser and you should be ashamed you don't give any real decent mid-fi options. No sub bass and no stereo imaging because the driver is just too small. Most overhyped brand I have ever seen. 20 years of this and you release the hd650 with the same drivers and a new flavor. Get with the times Sennheiser sell a mid-fi headphone with larger drivers.;Not a mid-fi option like it pretends to be!

My impression: these headphones just starve for bass... Now, this said, I'm not a person who goes crazy about pumping basses all over the head, though I like to have some.\nE17 gives them some major software improvement over built-in EQ, but my D1 doesn't make it. Just to be clear with my review, I am just a starting audiophile and still am having some help from people who know the whole thing better.\nYou would love this to listen to: Classical music, Jazz\nYou would not want to buy this for: Hip-Hop, Rap, R'n'B, Rock-related styles\nIf someone asked me what would I buy instead? I'd look at the Beyerdinamic DT880/DT990 depending on personal taste.

74;62.0;4.0;13.0;As a New York recording a mixing engineer I've had the opportunity to listen to quite a few pairs of headphones.  The Sennheiser HD600s are the clearest, fullest, and most balanced headphones I've heard so far.  While they wouldn't work for a performer in the studio because of the open-air design and considerable leakage, they have become a must-have as a mixing reference, especially when mixing in a new and unfamiliar room.\n\nGrado makes some wonderful headphones that sound nearly as good as the HD600s but the up-against-the-ear design makes them uncomfortable after less than 15 minutes, whereas the HD600s, even with their snug fit, are still very comfortable for long periods of time.\n\nIf you know of a better pair of headphones, I want to know about them!;Great sounding cans
18;63.0;5.0;5.0;These headphones have been stuck on my head for the past two days. Even attempting to remove these headphones leads to severe withdrawl symptoms.\n\nMy first pair of decent headphones was the Sony MDR v6. After using them daily for five years, the padding was flaking off and I decided it was time for an upgrade. I considered the HD 598, HD 600, and HD 650. Even after reading so many positive reviews of the HD 600, I was still very hesitant to spend so much money on one pair of headphones. The headphones came in a large foam lined box. There is a 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter included.\n\nThe headphones are surprisingly light, and have lots of comfortable padding. The head band is adjustable, and each ear cup can swivel from side to side. The oval shaped padding is large enough to fully surround each ear, so your ears will not get squished. I have not experienced any pressure issues that other reviewers have noted, and they are comfortable to wear for long periods.\n\nI have not used a headphone amplifier with this pair of headphones. I have a decent sound card for my computer, and only need the volume at 50%. However, my FiiO X1 needs to be at nearly maximum volume to drive these properly so I would suggest a portable amplifier for mobile listening.\n\nHow do these headphones sound? Clear. Transparent. Crisp. Sparkly. Neutral. Balanced. Immersive.\n\nWords can only say so much. Experience them for yourself.;Buying the HD 600 has been the best decision of my life!

34;65.0;2.0;6.0;If you love bass, these are not the headphones for you. I hear nothing below 80 Hz. I've owned the Denon AHD2000 for over 6 years and they blow these Sennheiser's out, silly me for believing all these good reviews. Even the (I hate to say it because they're a mainstream gimmick but) Beats Studio sound better than these headphones. I now use these for gaming because I have no other purpose for them unfortunately! These headphones aren't terrible, they're well built and look decent (looks better in pictures) so I can't give them a 1 but the bass response is awful.;Not for bass lovers
50;66.0;5.0;8.0;"I have sort of an emotional attachment to these headphones.  I've had them since September 25th, 2011, and I love them/their sound more now than I did back when they were new.  I just figured I'd finally drop in and say some words about this product.\n\nEquipment:\nI have a Bottlehead Crack amp with speedball upgrade.  I also have some nice tubes (about $75 each) plugged into my amp.  I have an HRT Music Streamer II+ running from my computer into my amp.  I've gone through the typical route of entry-level amp/dacs, grabbing the Fiio E7/E9, Electric Avenue PA2V2, and Fiio E17 along my journey of tasty music.  I've heard the Bottlehead Crack with multiple different stock or ""cheap"" tubes, and now with my nice ones that I researched around before buying.  Also, I replaced the cable with the HD 650 cable (mainly it's just more durable imo).\n\nThe Headphones:\nThey're beautifully made.  Their aesthetic is fairly timeless if you ask me, as is true of any well-designed product.  They're stiff and strong, and they really fit well.  I can keep them on my head for about 6+ hours at a time before having to rip them off, which is truly saying a lot.  My ATH-M50's are really uncomfortable by comparison.  I love the velour pads and the memory foam padding, they're really nice and I personally love them, I'll never go with anything but velour earpads ever again after being treated to HD 600's pads. I have since ordered Velour pads for my ATH-M50s and it's a much-needed upgrade in the comfort department.\n\nThe Sound:\nThe sound is *very* clean and balanced, which is what these headphones are known for.  The whole breadth of the music, from the lowest lows to the peaking (yet non-fatiguing) highs are apparent in every song of every genre.  There are no awkward boomy frequencies, and nothing sticks out more than anything else. As an example, times when this is most apparent is during a jazz track with an upright bass. The upright bass is naturally a loose-sounding/boomy instrument where the bass vibrates in and out of different volume levels every time it's plucked. These headphones can tame the loose upright bass, while the piano, drums, and brass have their separated place, playing as a blended ensemble instead of a just collection of instruments. These headphones are very revealing, and it's amazing to come from listening to ""veiled"" headphones (headphones that muck up detail) to this analytical sound.\n\n[Side Note]:\nBefore I broke them in, they sounded a little too ""dry"", aka 2-dimensional, flat or lifeless in a sense, where there's not really any excitement or dynamism to the sound.  It was detailed, but not dynamic or lively.  After breaking the headphones in for 200 hours, they are much better, as are any and every headphone I've ever had.  Breaking-in headphones truly works, I've experienced it with speakers, subwoofers, and headphones all all the same (except earbuds).\n\nIf you're used to a lot of bass, it can *seem* disappointing, but if you give these headphones enough juice through a nice amp and DAC, the sound fills out nicely.  The bass becomes more full, bellowing and resonant, but NEVER overpowering; always tasteful and clean.  Separation of instruments increases, allowing you to hear more pieces of the music at once instead of one wall of sound.  It almost seems like the HD 600's grow additional mini-speakers within the drivers to play each part of a song separately, as that's the best way I can describe it.\n\nIn short, the sound becomes full-bodied and never fatiguing when you give these cans the juice they need to shine.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to spend money on a $300 amp and DAC, seriously.  I baby-stepped my way through, and I'll say that I never really had that come to Jesus moment until I got the Bottlehead Crack amp.  Also, when you're listening for differences or trying to justify that you just bought this amp and are going to ""hear"" the differences, you won't really ""hear"" it.  You can't ""listen"" for more of this or more of that, more bass or more separation, it's honest to god just a feeling.  To me, I felt myself bobbing my head a lot more than I usually did with songs I'd heard many times before, because I was really feeling the music in my head bounce like never before.

90;67.0;5.0;15.0;The HD600s are my fourth audiophile headphone.  The previous cans were the HD265, the SR60, and the HD580.  The sound from the HD580 and the HD600 are very close.  The HD600, however, is a little more detailed and has a better sound stage than the HD580.\nThe only problem with either the HD580 or the HD600 is the quality of the source.  Most PCDPs (personal CD players) sound better with a more forgiving phone (e.g. Grado SR60).  While a PCDPs can drive the HD580 and the HD600 they sound muddy compared to a good source.  Just as you wouldn't expect to run $5000 speakers off a $100 boom-box, the HD600s are more at home with a good amp and a quality CD/DVD/LP player.\nI have yet to hear a speaker system come close to the HD600s mated with a good DVD player and a good headphone amp.  If you aren't using quality sources, don't buy the HD600 (consider the cheaper HD580 {not HD590}).  Plugging the HD600s into most inexpensive receivers will cause the background to be filled with sibilance.\nIf you do buy the HD600s, I would seriously consider investing in a headphone amplifier.  There are great headphone amps for less than [price], if you know where to look.  Or, you can make one for [price].;It's all about the source:
68;68.0;2.0;11.0;I listen to everything - tv, computer, you name it - on headphones. So I was looking forward to an upgrade over my old Sony studio headphones when I bought the Sennheiser HD 600.\n\nThe open ear design is very comfortable, much more comfortable than the Sony.\n\nThe sound is nice on most music and tv, comparable to the Sony with maybe a little more clarity in the high frequencies.\n\nBut when I watched/listened to my first dvd using the HD600, I was upset to discover that they overload horribly during every explosion, engine rumble, or any other loud sound effect. The elements producing the sound begin to crackle and pop and buzz until the sound effect ends - which totally ruins the experience of watching any action movies, which are FILLED with these kinds of sound effects every couple of minutes. Sometimes the finale of an action film has explosive or rumbling sound effects continuously for several minutes.\n\nThe HD600 RUINS movie sound! Do not buy these headphones if you intend to use them with a home entertainment system!\n\nI had to go back to using my old beat up Sony headphones for movies - they cost a third of what these cost, and they actually sound better.\n\nI expected much better of the Sennheiser HD600 for the price.;Good Sound on Music, Terrible for Movies
65;69.0;5.0;10.0;i have been an electronic music fanatic for many many years. techno, house, tech house, progressive house, deep house, etc. i have been producing music for about 3 years. i really wanted a very nice pair of headphones for checking my mixes on as well as for listening to music on without throwing off my ears. my studio monitors are the event opals. i am very picky about my sound. i did tons of research and found a bunch of open and closed back candidates in my price range (up to $500). these were the sennheiser hd600, sennheiser hd650, sennheiser hd25 ii, akg k701, grado sr325is, denon ahd2000, ultrasone pro750, beyerdynamic dt770 and dt7880. i was able to obtain all of them and spent about an hour with each one. without going into tons of detail, i found the hd600's to be by far the best headphones in the group, as well as the best headphones i have ever heard. the 650's are nice too but i found the bass to be mushy (they have more bass - directed to the average person that likes more bass, not the audio engineer). in 2nd place were the denon ahd2000, which sounded great, especially for closed headphones. up next were the hd25's, although i think they would be much better for dj'ing. their sound was much more aggressive and up front. i am completely in love with the hd600's and all i can say is that i HIGHLY recommend them. i finally found a pair of phones i really love! absolutely phenomenal.\n\nPS i would recommend upgrading the cable to the one that the 650's come with. thicker and better quality cable. it's here on amazon: [...]\n\nbest of luck!\n\nEDIT: i also just want to add that getting a proper headphone amp for these is truly vital. they are 300 ohm headphones which is very high impedance so having a discrete amp to power them is of the utmost importance or you really are wasting your money. some cheap options are the Fiio E7 + E9 combo for just under $200. don't get just the E7.. you really cannot hear the difference. if you have a little more cash then the Nuforce Icon HD is $350. to put it in perspective, a pair of HD600's with one of these amps will sound far better than the $1500 HD800's with no amp (they are 600 ohms). it makes a huge difference! oh and it has been months since i initially wrote this review and i am still in love with these headphones. i have used them for working on my music while at home and listening to electronic music, classic rock, classical, and all kinds of videos, etc on the internet. they are incredible!

70;70.0;5.0;11.0;I have had these phones several years now and they are excellent.  I much prefer these for accuracy when compared to the veiled and unnaturally creamy sound of the HD650s which I ended up returning.  The phones are also more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.;Excellent Phones
57;71.0;5.0;9.0;"EDIT 9-20-12:\nI'm now using these headphones with the Dragonfly DAC/amp and the sound quality just shot up by a WIDE margin!  The Dragonfly does wonders for the HD600.  I highly recommend the Dragonfly as a source over the Essence STX and receiver.\nHappy listening!\n\nOriginal Review:\nI've had the HD600 for about a month now and was initially unimpressed with the sound coming out of it.\n\nI have the ASUS Essence STX soundcard (a music lover's soundcard with built-in headphone amp) and hooked the HD600 up to it thinking it would do a good job of driving the headphone like it did for my AGK K702.  The AGK K701/K702 are often compared to Sennheiser's HD600/650 for good reason; they both fall into the same price range (well...used to) and sound great in their own ways.  At first glance, the ASUS soundcard seemed to be doing a decent job of driving the HD600.  Volume was never an issue and clarity seemed good, although it wasn't as clear as the K702.  Unfortunately, the soundstage was a lot smaller than the K702 (this was expected) and seemingly more narrow (tunnel vision like) but it was bigger than the HD598 by a slight margin.\n\nI then tried to burn-in the headphones to see if it would make a difference. (I believe in burn-in since there was a noticeable difference when I burned in the K702)  After about 50 hours of burn-in and regular usage, there was hardly any detectable sound difference from the 0 hour state.  I'm not going to rule out the possibility the HD600 needing additional burn-in time and may update the review to reflect the changes.\n\nThe next step was changing the stock cable to that of the HD650, as was advised by many reviewers here.  The HD650 stock cable is much thicker and durable than the HD600 stock cable.  Did it make a difference in sound quality?  It did sound better, but barely.  It's a cheap upgrade and probably worth having even if it didn't affect the sound.\n\nAt this point:\nASUS Essence STX + K702 = large soundstage, high clarity, low bass presence, great treble and vocals\nASUS Essence STX + HD600 = narrow soundstage, decent clarity, great bass presence, good treble and vocals\n\nI was ready give it 4 stars as I still preferred the AKG K702 and thought it sounded better in all regards except bass.\n\nThen I decided to hook this up to my high end Pioneer Elite receiver.  What changed? A LOT!!!\nThe soundstage got bigger and was much wider (although not as big as the K702's)  Front positioned vocalists and instruments no longer sounded like they were in my face; they were pushed a little further back, making them sound more laid back.  The clarity shot up in quality to rival the AKG K702, making it sound less veiled than before.  I didn't think the receiver would make this much of a difference, since it only made slight sound improvements for the K702, but it did!\n\nReciever + HD600 = large soundstage, high clarity, great bass, treble, vocals, everything\n\nWith this set up, the HD600s are indeed 5 star material.\n\nDoes it sound better than the K702?\nFor songs in most genres, yes.  For classical, choirs, orchestra or anything else that takes place in a spacious auditorium, no.\n\nOverall, the AGK K702 sound great with the ASUS Essence STX and receiver.  The HD600 does not pair up to the soundcard as well and required the receiver to sound great.  Just another example of how your experience will depend on whether or not your headphones pair up well with your arsenal of amp/soundcard/receiver/anything-but-an-ipod.";A Story of How Source Matters
41;72.0;5.0;6.0;As both an audio engineer and recording artist, I use these for checking mixes. They are to me just another means of making sure everything translates properly. I don't find them to be lacking in bass as some people have noted. Nor do I find them to be overly dark as a fellow engineer recently told me. I find them pretty spot on neutral which is what I wanted out of them. I know when something sounds good on these, I've gotten pretty close to my goal. That doesn't mean I would mix with these, but I might check for certain details in the soundstage with these as opposed to my monitors. They have a very accurate soundstage. Indeed, listening to a 32 bit master as I wrote this, I find very little is lacking. And now that they've  lowered the price to $279, you really can't do better at this price point.\n\nBy the way,  I upgraded the stock cable with the ZY, a moderate priced cable that yielded positive results in audio through these cans.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Cable-Sennheiser-Headphone-Upgrade-ZY-044/dp/B00EI8AXYS/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&qid=1439069989&sr=8-17&keywords=Replacement+cable+sennheiser+HD+600;A great pair of reference phones and a great deal at the new price
61;73.0;4.0;9.0;I'm no audiophile and I can't really tell the difference between these and the cheap eh350s in terms of sound quality other than very minor differences. I also can't really tell any major differences between the flac format and mp3 format. With that said, I mainly bought these because my previous headphones were hurting my ears after extended use and I can't wear regular closed ear headphones, what I can tell is that these headphones are wayyyy more comfortable than some of the others I've worn. The headphone definitely has a weight to it but it's not uncomfortable, the headphone also has huge ear cups which relieved me of the ear pains from my last headphones, and people with larger heads might feel a bit of a pinch as the headphones do seem pretty stiff. I suppose comfort isn't exactly worth 300+ dollars for most people but coming from someone who can't wear regular closed ear headphones (something about the sensation of my ears being completely isolated from wearing closed ear headphones gives me a headache and makes me want to puke), I will tell you they're worth it!;:3
27;74.0;5.0;5.0;These headphones are absolutely life changing... They are the best reference open headphones I've ever had the privileged to own.\n\nI currently own philips fidelio x1, Beyerdynamics DT990 Pro and now these beautiful cans. I absolutely cant take these off my head. They make my other spectacular headphones sound just average. I cant wait to put these on my head when I get home to enjoy music as it was mixed to be.;Sound how its supposed to be!
30;75.0;5.0;5.0;My main reference system for work is a Meyer Sound Labs 803/804, which is a real accurate and powerful one, and the very first moment I do listen to the Sennheiser HD 600 Headphones, bring me back when I first open my ears to a new world with the Meyer system. Excellent stereo image, depth, definition, low end consistency and an airy, but natural sound top end. For the price, it's really a bargain what you get if you choose this model. Do not hesitate, if you want to listen to the real thing, without coloration, go for a pair of HD 600.;Do not hesitate if you are looking for accuracy and excellent response.
32;76.0;5.0;5.0;"Having owned my HD 600s for over a decade. 5.......i set them down and tried about 30 pairs of headphones this last year 2014- 2015.

58;77.0;5.0;8.0;"Headphones, like speakers are fairly timeless... They don't really ever wear out provided you take even a little care of them.\n\nHowever, just like any ""chain"" - the quality of the whole, is really only as good as the weakest link.  Not that these are the weak link - likely they will be one of the strongest links in your audio chain - but people talk about using source materials of their MP3's or their iPhones... and really, those are just not high quality sources. Consider that not long ago before portable music became faddish, people used to (actually still do) spend thousands on a good CD player, thousands on their amplification. Now people pair these headphones - which were designed when people spent the thousands on the other stuff - and wonder why they don't ""deliver"" that mystical sound that they see people discuss.  Well, does anyone expect a DVD to look as good as the movie in the theatre? Does anyone expect their photos to look like the photos produced by a medium format camera?\n\nYou have to use a good source - lossless is fine - but you only get about 20% compression,  but then the signal is being processed by ""something"" that may or may not have good specs... Yeah, I know all about that people can't ""hear"" the difference between 320 kpbs and a CD - well then why does anyone produce CD's at the higher bit rate? Well, initially it was to ensure that CD's produced as good a quality as the analog phonograph records - and that was the competition. But, people can hear a difference - obviously - can no one really tell if they are listening to recorded music rather than live? Even if the music is a live recording? Also, a lot of people still prefer the sound of vinyl over digital CD's.\n\nThe other thing these headphones need is an amplifier. They will sound good without one, but they only really start to sound good with an amplifier. It does not have to be an expensive one - there are some cMoy types out there (30 -50 dollars) that will do a reasonable job. But some better amplifiers will do a better job. Why do we need amplifiers with $300 headphones? Seems a waste doesn't it? Well - they have a 300 ohm impedance, and so they are just not efficient, like most of the headphones that are produced today. The Ultrasone Edition 10 ($2800) are 40 ohms for instance...  So, the 600's need a little boost to get them going - but once you have a reasonable source, and a reasonable amplifier - these are still some of the best sounding phones that I have ever listened to. I have not tried the new ultrasones, but I have tried various Grado, Beyerdynamics, AT. I have some Ultimate Ear Triple Fi 10s and like them a lot, but they don't sound like the 600's to me.. My home speakers are Vandersteen 3cs.. they are great - but those too need proper amplification. I like my Vandersteen's better than the 600's but for a lot of other reasons having to do with how one likes to listen to music.\nSo people see this great deal on expensive headphones, and then get disappointed, because they pay a lot of money and they don't sound like they thought the headphones should sound like - bad source, poor or no amplification - yeah - the headphones only sound great when used with good equipment. However, they are great headphones, and if you get a great price, listen to some good CD's on a CD player (even your DVD player at home is probably a good source) - get a reasonable amplifier, and you will be very happy. If you want some great sounding headphones ""out of the box"" to use with your MP3 players - get some with low impedance - the Sennheiser Px 100's or 200s.. Or the Grado 60's or 80s.. they cost a lot less, and you'll be happy about saving the money, and having great sound. But, if you want to have a taste of what the audiophiles listen to with their $20,000 on up  home rigs - this is one of the ways to get close - but you need a reasonable amplifier that is designed for high impedance headphones, and a good music source.. Climbing off my soapbox-  but like many things - expensive things are usually expensive for a reason, and frequently they don't perform the way people expect them to, because they are using them improperly.\nI have owned mine for a couple of years and look forward to using them, and enjoying them for many, many years...";Still one of the best you can get
46;78.0;4.0;6.0;A very good headphone. Though, to my well worn ears, seems to be lacking pristine highs. As a result the soundstage does not have the definition and air that I find in AKG's Q701 or K70x series phones.\nNote: after a decade in 70s Rock Bands followed by 20 years as a recording engineer, also mostly R&R, anything above 5k is seriously compromised to say the least. Hence, I would strongly recommend that anyone getting up in years or who may have abused their ears should compare both the Senn HD600/650s and AKG's Q/K70x series. Older ears may really appreciate AKGs top end!;Great head phone for pristine ears, others should cosider AKG Q701 or K70x
37;79.0;5.0;5.0;I bought my HD 600 headphones in 1997, when they were first introduced (and a lot more expensive). Since then, I have used them nearly every day, carting them around to different parts of the world with different climates and not always, I confess, caring for them very well. They still sound spectacular, fit perfectly, and even look pretty good. I had to replace the cable about 2 years ago--a minor matter--but that's it.\n\nI just gave two stars to a pair of (earbud-style) headphones that sounded great but died after a year of light use, so I thought I'd come over here and celebrate a product with REAL value.;Years of Listening Pleasure: 18 and Counting
92;80.0;2.0;12.0;Headphones are supposed to let you enjoy music without disturbing other people around you. These headphones leak so much sound that I can't listen to music in bed without waking my wife.\nAlso, because they leak so much sound, they create feedback in the recording studio. My nephew tried them and says the volume is much weaker than his Sony phones...;Warning: Don't Buy These Headphones!!
82;81.0;5.0;10.0;I originally was educated about the audio beauty of Sennheiser headphones over 5 years ago, having only experienced the most basic of Sony headphones that you would get at a local electronics store. I was under the assumption that headphones are headphones, what could possibly be different about a pair with a name I had never heard of versus a pair made by an electronic giant like Sony? As I slipped the Sennheisers on my ears, I never looked back.\n\nIgnorance was NOT bliss in this case.\n\nSoon after I got to experience what music is supposed to sound like, I quickly purchased a pair of Sennheiser headphones of my own and have enjoyed them ever since. From their cool, velvety feel to the crispness of audio clarity, I challenge anyone to find a headphone manufacturer that exceed Sennheiser.\n\nMy Sennheisers have given me hours upon hours of sonic joy and I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you give them a chance. Are Sennheiser headphones more expensive? Are Mercedes more expensive? I am sure if you ask a Mercedes owner to give up their keys for a Ford they would laugh at your just as quickly as I would if someone wanted to replace my Sennheiser headphones with a Sony pair from Best Buy.\n\nYou will NOT be disappointed.\n\n***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION;Sennheiser = Pure Audio Bliss
69;82.0;5.0;8.0;There are maybe four or five headphones in the world better than these (including two others by Sennheiser), but those are each much expensive and/or compromised in other ways.  Feel confident buying these without hearing them.  They are simply amazing.  I have bought a total of four sets (two for gifts for family).  The clarity is ear-opening so-to-speak, and will make you realize just how inadequate lesser headphones and earphones are.  They will bring your I-pod to life, and make you start storing all of your music in uncompressed format because you will readily hear a significant difference between different levels of bitrate and compression on most music (if the original source file or master is good enough).  A great way to take one of the few affordable tastes of high-end audio, and decide if you want to spend more on other components.;Your last pair of headphones
71;83.0;5.0;8.0;"After a year+ with Sennheiser's HD 595s and a few days with these, I can tell you confidently that these have improved sound.  They are a bit more neutral and more extended, with tighter, stronger bass as well as better defined highs.\n\nBut I'm not sure they were worth the money, given that I already had a pretty good set of cans in the HD 595.\n\nThey are discernably better (even w/o burn-in) but the comparative listening I've done indicates that the 595s are well within the ""same league.""  Had I had the good sense to test both before buying either one, I would have spent the extra $$ on these.  The imaging (location of instruments and voices) is notably better (though the 595 is very good), and the dynamic range seems to be modestly better (tighter and stronger bass).  But since I already own the 595s, I'm not quite sure about whether to indulge myself by keeping these headphones or sending them back.\n\nI'm darned sure that, if I didn't already own the 595s, I'd be keeping them happily.";"FANTASTIC, but not ""way better"" than HD 595s"
94;84.0;5.0;10.0;I initially bought AKG 501s for Classical Music listening.  Having tried them out for the past year I was convinced that they lacked the low end range needed to represent the music stage.  They are good for vocals and single instruments i.e. harpsichord, violin, guitar but again to restate, the sound stage is lacking.\nNow, having read multiple reviews of the Sens 600, I recently bought them especially for the reason above - I wanted to feel imersed in the music, both wanting to hear the instruments and the deep lows making the stage.  These headphones give me all that.  The individual instruments are heard as well as the AKGs but now the deeper cello and base are heard and felt.  The drums come alive.  I feel the soundstage as I could not with the AKGs.\nMy setup is somewhat portable.  I use a phillips portable CD player connected to a total airhead amp.;Best headphones I have owned
49;85.0;5.0;5.0;"Bought these as a lightning deal in 2011. Price was great. I had heard many wonderful things about these headphones over the years and was eager to try them. I was using Audio-Technica ATH-A900 for 7 years before I bought the HD 600. I haven't used the A900 a single time since I received the Sennheisers. The first thing I noticed was how huge they sounded compared to my old headphones. There were times I would say, ""What the heck was that?"" turning my head thinking something on the other end of the room was making noise, but it was just part of the music coming from the speaker an inch away from my ear. Everything I've played through them has sounded wonderful. I have used them daily for over two years, and there is barely any sign of wear. They are pretty comfortable. I have no issues wearing them for eight or more hours a day. I sometimes forget they are even on. Very happy with them.";Sennheiser HD 600
78;86.0;5.0;8.0;"These are great headphones, given the right environment. The sound is silky smooth, as good as your source material can deliver. Not super efficient, so are better with a home audio equipment headphone jack than  lower-powered portable player outputs (though listenable on these as well). These are best used in a quiet environment, when you won't be disturbed by others, and you won't disturb others. Because these are ""open"" headphones, you can hear sounds around you, and other people can hear what you play on these headphones. This, along with their size and cost, argue strongly against using these as portable headphones - don't bring them on a train or airplane trip.\n\nFor over a year, I wore them 5 - 8 hours a day. They were as comfortable as headphones can be, and I heard all sorts of details in my music that I had never heard before. It would be a shame to waste the quality of these headphones by using them on compressed MP3s, because with these headphones, you may well notice the difference in quality.\n\nNo complaints at all on acoustics, except that I wish I was more often in an environment appropriate to use them. Occasionally the wires get loose, and one side will lose its input, but one can pull the wire out and reinsert it to fix that.";Beautiful Sound, Great Comfort
54;87.0;5.0;5.0;I have been buying headphones for years now, looking for just the right one. It has been a long journey, but I am finally here. The last pair I owned was a pair of Stax electrostatics that was so uncomfortable I could only wear them for half an hour at a time. (It doesn't matter how good headphones sound if they hurt you.) The HD 600 is the last headphone I'll buy. It does exactly what I want with precision, grace and charm, and I can comfortably wear them all day long. Anything above this gets so far past the point of diminishing returns that it would become embarrassing and financially foolish for me to go there.\n\nI am running these with a classic Pioneer Elite integrated amp that has a very nice headphone section. The first sign for me of a good set of cans is when I keep taking them off to check if my main speakers are playing. These are like that... I'm listening late at night and I think I must be disturbing people because the soundstage is expansive and the sound so sweet and full on these things.;End of the Journey
75;88.0;5.0;7.0;These are the best headphones you can buy. They are better than the HD 650.

I paid $275 on Amazon for these phones and was not willing to buy the NEW 650 hd ones for around $60 more at J&R Music world. I have heard they have a hyped up bass response and are not as balanced as the 600 HD.\nIf you don't want to spend this type of money, buy the 595 hd or 555 hd, they will be vey pleasing & comfortable to your ears @ MUCH MORE REASONABLE PRICES!\n\nUPDATE 2/6/2011: Still have these phones and they still sound great. Upgraded cord to 650 heavier stock cord about 2 years ago and they sounded even better. No need to buy anything more than the 600s! I see now that these phones go for $399. This is a lot more than I paid for them.  They are classic but probably not worth $400 bucks. I don't think any phones are worth that much. The search for the perfect phones does not exist. After a certain balanced sound is achieved, and wearing comfort is found, it becomes more about a matter of ""personal taste"" of how good they sound rather than an ""absolute"" better sound! So buy what is comfortable and sounds good to you after trying different types of phones, open air, closed, portables, etc. These 600s worked for me as my main home listening phones for about 30 minutes but then I switch to my portable phones like the Sennheiser PX100, Koss Porta-Pro and Koss KDE/250.  I find them less bulky and more enjoyable for longer listening.";THE BEST @ A SOMEWHAT REASONABLE COST
66;90.0;5.0;6.0;I listen to classical music and sound quality is very important. These headphones had excellent reviews in Stereophile and although not cheap they are not priced outrageously. They were much superior to my previous headphones, Grado 60's and I did have an opportunity to give them a reality test. I attended a chamber music concert where the Brahms first sextet was played. Before the concert I listened to a recording of the sextet using the Sennheiser HD600's. During the concert, when I closed my eyes, I had an illusion of being at home listening through the headphones. I found that the headphones do not require a headphone amplifier.

I have tried other headphones and they don't sound as well, I also tried the HD800s at a store and they did sound amazing, but I could not tell that much difference hearing normal music, so I did not think they were worth the extra $1100 dlls for the small (if at all) improvement.\n\nThe build is a bit weird because they are all plastic (except for the grills) and may appear cheap, but they sound absolutely incredible.\n\nI got them for work and home while playing or listening to music, they are open so I can also hear if the phone rings.\n\nThey are very comfortable to wear for long hours.\n\nOne tip, they are 300 ohm so your computer output might or might not be enough to drive them, your phone or ipad will definitely not power them well. I got a portable headphone amplifier these and they are absolutely amazing.;Could not be happier
60;93.0;5.0;5.0;"Back in the day my friends and I would listen to music for hours on end, and everyone seemed to love it. But there was a few of us that were obsessed with the music and we created listening  rooms in our houses, I remember the big Marantz amplifiers combined with huge JBL and Altec Lancing speakers, Man what a sound, Frampton, Floyd, Hendricks, Zepplin, Supertramp, Clapton  and hundreds more something I could never forget. Then life happens and there's no room for all that glorious equipment, so you move it to the garage then a garage sale. I never thought I'd hear that sound again, but I did, I don't know all the tech stuff but my Sennheiser  HD 600 headphones took me back to my listening room in one small package. My friends are amazed at the music that pours out of them. I have three children, oldest son (32) agrees my youngest son (16) said,""Man, I guess I really never heard music before"". THANK YOU FOR A SUPERB PRODUCT!!!!!";Back In The Day
62;94.0;5.0;5.0;I have had these headphones for about half a year.  i am right now listening to Mozart's Requiem.  the vocal ensemble separation is amazing.  There is a section where the string basses come in with a sforzando, and i can swear i can hear how the bows are heavily rosined, and i know for a fact i can hear the minute splatter of the string on the fingerboard, adding to the color of the sforzando.  i feel like I'm back playing bass back in my high school orchestra (except these guys play a bit better than we did.)\n\nthe statements by another reviewer saying it's like getting a brand new CD collection with these headphones is confirmed by my experience,;is it live or is it sennheiser?
64;95.0;3.0;5.0;If you don't have a headphone amp then don't worry, these sound great without one and even better with one.\n\nBuild quality (0/2 stars):\nI docked 2 stars due to the build quality. Normally I can throw my headphones on the couch when walking into the room. If I do it with thise pair I'm going to break them. When I took them out of the box and put them on, my left speaker wasn't working so I wigged the cable and it start working, then my right wasn't working so I wigged again. They spared no expense at finding a cheap cable to pair these with. This is problem that happens with every pair so don't think you'll escape it (google it if you don't believe me) but if you are like me then you don't care because you can sit still and not tug your cable. For this price you'd expect German or American build quality but you get Chinese.. but we're not buying these because we want solid build quality, we're buying these for the sound.\n\nSound quality (3/3 stars):\nI'm running these off of a cheap $150 desktop headphone amp. These have a great 3d stage, you can hear the cornet guy on the left, the singer in your face and the piano guy somewhere over there. You'll get a lot more detail in the instruments then you'll get with a $150 set of headphones (with or without the amp). Things like hearing the bow rubbing the violin strings, hearing 3 guitars where you only heard 1 before.. great stuff like that. The bass is good and very comfortable for me. I like a low and subtle bass and these aren't as subtle as I like. The mid range is decent but doesn't warrant any praise or elbow drops. The highs are where I feel it with these. They're very sharp, my ears are virgin to the tones this thing comes out with so I've used the EQ to tone it down and save my stereocilia a horrid fate.;Great sound, shoddy quality
77;96.0;5.0;6.0;I have used these for years and I feel that they are truely wonderful, lyrical, sweet, non-fatiguing.\n\nThey are very very detailed without being harsh (a difficult trick). They accurately produce ALL 10 audio octaves 20-20k Hz, and more important, much more important, they are ruler flat, no rolloff in the bass or treble octaves. (Many other components, while claiming 20-20K hz response, have a very uneven frequency response and are rolled off in the high treble and low bass) The highs are sweet and the bass is warm and full without being thumpy. They are also comfortable to wear for many hours. They will show you, with a good amp, exactly what is on the recording, (warts and all if its a bad recording). From what I've heard Sennheiser makes the most listenable headphones in every price class on the market - down to their $25 model 100. I have listened to most of the other brands (without mentioning names) and nothing can touch them.\n\nBeyond measurable stats, they are really MUSICAL and NATURAL. (it's possible to make a product that measures well and sounds dreadful. That show how little the measurments the industry uses actually measure what we hear!)\n\nI have NOT found that the 300 ohm impedience limited their performance. I listened once with a 3 watt vacuum tube amp (yes 3!) and they sounded great, more than adequately loud. I have heard them with Sony walkman, discman.\n\nI have not heard the new model (HD 650) but I imagine it's even better, if that possible. With a good amp and preamp etc, they will give you the sound quality of a pair of high end speakers 100 times their price!\n\nHighest Recommendation. A perenial Stereophile favorite.\nGolden Ears.;best I've ever heard. lyrical, sweet, wonderful
1;97.0;5.0;7.0;awesome quality headphones .. but with that huge price tag, it's quite an investment.  If you want quality over price, go with these babies -- you WONT be sorry!;these things kick -- but the price tag hurts.
87;98.0;5.0;6.0;I bought my Sennheiser HD600 headphones about 3 months ago. I broke them in with about 50 hours of jazz music after which they sound amazing!\n\nRealize that you need a headphone amp for these headphones. I refused to pay $500+ for a headphone amp and it took me a lot of time to find a good, low-cost amp. I finally found an excellent amp in the Samson S-Monitor. They cost just $60 and they offer clean, undistorted output. You can easily spend $500 on a headphone amp but I somehow doubt it'll sound better than the Samson S-Monitor - Sennheiser HD600 headphone combo.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the poor man's alternative for $20.000+ high-end static speakers! What you read in the other positive reviews about the Sennheiser HD600 is true, if you have good ears you should definitely get these headphones. Unless you don't like headphones and can afford high-end static speakers of course.;I am in love with my Sennheiser HD600 headphones!
73;99.0;5.0;5.0;I've been wanting to buy a HD600 for many years because it seemed to be the benchmark for a lot of professional studio engineers and reviewers, not to mention budding audiophiles. But I hesitated because it's pretty expensive in Australia (A$600-700) and wasn't sure whether I wanted an Open headphone. Until recently I only had Closed ones including Sennheiser HD280pro. But I bought Koss KSC75 and Alessandro MS-1 (a tweaked Grado SR80) open headphones and liked the sound. Given the recent fall of the US dollar, I decided to purchase HD600 from amazon - even after a hefty shipping charge of US$54, it still only cost me US$349 (about A$385).\n\nI burned it in for about 200 hours using a variety of source materials including a couple of audio test CDs. I mostly listen to my music collection (re-ripped in either ALC lossless or AAC 256kbps) in my iPod Classic 80G via line-out to my Minibox-E headphone amp (which is a fantastic little amp I got from Head Direct for US$159). (It's not a good idea to connect your amp to the iPod's earphone output. Buy a line-out connector.)\n\nThe HD600 is beautifully built and wonderful to look at. Its clamping force is a bit too strong initially but it gets better with use. It's now one of the most comfortable headphones I tried.\n\nThe sound is exactly what I expected after reading so many reviews over the years. It's very clear, neutral and musical. It highlights any inadequacies of the source material. Low-bit rate MP3s are painful. But it lets you discover your music collection all over by bringing out the details you never noticed before.\n\nI also use it with my computer sometimes. I connect it directly to an external soundcard (Creative Audigy 2NX USB with separate power) and it seems to drive HD600 adequately. I might purchase a dedicated DAC unit later. Also on the wish list is a balanced rig (amp & cable with XLR connectors). It costs about US$2000 but it's supposed to make HD600 sing. The question is whether I can justify the expense to my wife. :);Exactly what I expected
89;100.0;5.0;5.0;I have been a Sennheiser fan for many years and still have the Sennheiser 414s from the 70s (and they still sound great). I wanted a good headphone to go with my Rotel RX-1050 receiver/amplifier because it reproduces sound so beautifully. In the Sennheiser 600s I got what I wanted and then some. They are a sheer listening pleasure. As other reviewers have mentioned, they do not work well with a portable CD player and would need an amp to perform properly. They are execellent with a good home stereo but they do let you hear exactly what is on your source, so with lower quality equipment, they will sound only as good as your stuff (garbage in, garbage out -- don't blame the 600s). These earphones are the best I have ever listened to. They are a joy to use. They fit reasonably comfortably but could get warm with prolonged use. Overall they are an excellent addition to any audiophile's equipment.  My only (minor) gripe is the rather flimsy cable that comes standard.  I am thinking of purchasing the Equinox cable (which has gotten excellent reviews) or making my own custom cable to further enchance the sound of these wonderful cans.;A quantum leap in listening pleasure

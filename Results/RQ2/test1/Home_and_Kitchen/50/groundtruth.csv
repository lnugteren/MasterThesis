45;2.0;1.0;178.0;"I fondly remember growing up with Revere cookware during the '50s and '60s.  It was sturdy and manufactured with care to precise measurements.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the same product.  Apparently, Revere cookware is now being manufactured in some third-world dumpster.  The overall construction is flimsy; it bends and dents easily.  None of the lids fit properly.  The unreasonably thin ""copper-cladding"" was unevenly applied and looks like a roller-coaster ride around the sides of the saucepans.  Revere needs to clean-up its act, or go out-of-business.";A BIG disappointment
2;3.0;2.0;167.0;"The other reviewer is right about old Revere Ware; its great stuff that'll last forever. However, newer Revere Ware, like what's being advertised here, is total junk. I own an old 2qt saucepan and a brand new 4.5qt Dutch oven. The Dutch oven is  flimsy and the lid doesn't fit well. If you want good Revere Ware make sure it's from the USA (not Indonesia, like the new stuff) and OLD. Try yard sales or ebay. The only thing to recommend new Revere ware is the 25 year warranty. That is the only way the old and new products are comparable.";BIG difference between old and new!
0;4.0;1.0;131.0;I ordered this pan beacuse I liked the old RevereWare pan I have had and wanted another.  I received this pan and could not believe how much lighter and of less quality it was as compared to the original RevereWare pan I have had for years.

10;7.0;1.0;27.0;"I had broken the handle off my circa 1980s Revere 2 quart and needed a replacement.  Breaking the handle off my original was my fault realizing that after 30+ years of washing the pot by holding the handle and torquing it to clean; the handle finally broke off.  I ordered this Revere 2 Qt as a replacement.  In comparison to my original, this product is not up to the standards of previous Revere Ware products.  This model is indeed thinner metal than my 1980s set, thus it does not have Revere Ware ""classic"" quality to it; it simply does not compare to my original 1980s model. That is the point of my post.  I can not say anything about the longevity of this particular product, but Revere Ware being prone to warping; I conclude be extra careful with heat and the pot being dry when using.\n\nUPDATE\nThis product is garbage, changed to 1 star.  I noticed the pot was wiggling around while cooking and couldn't believe it had already warped, after only a few uses.  I know these pots and I did not overheat or use dry, its simply too thin material for a cooking utensil.  Oddly I was able to bend the bottom back (that shows how thin), but then when I used it again a LOUD pop occurred and the pot bent back to its warped shape.  I do not recommend this product at all, I am very disappointed in this company.";Lower Quality Revere Ware
15;8.0;4.0;38.0;I ordered this to replace  one that came in a set that was about 25 years old. The handle broke off.  Didn't have the receipt. I was a little weary about ordering this because a lot of people commented that the quality wasn't the same. I measured the side wall thickness. Both measured .040 inch with a micrometer. Which is about 1 mm. Then I weighed each on a digital shipping scale that is regularly calibrated.  And I put the broken handle inside the old pot so both handle would be weighed. Both weighed 1.0 pounds. Looking at the handle and attachment point, they both appear to be identical. My old pot was made in Clinton, Illinois.  The new one in Indonesia.;Just as Good So Far
31;9.0;1.0;62.0;The quality of this pot is complete junk.  I made a mistake of throwing out the packaging and now I am stuck with this POS.  The worst part about this pot is that the interior surface is very rough and covered with dangerous metal residue from poor manufacturing process.\n\nI spent 35 minutes scrubbing it off AFTER the pot was put through a dishwasher.  I am still not comfortable using this for food preparation.  They should pull this terrible product off the market immediately -- it's simply irresponsible for this company to sell this crap to it's customers.\n\nSee attached picture -- the paper towel on the left shows how much metallic residue was on the pot AFTER it came from the dishwasher.

The bottom is so thin that the stamp shows through to the inside, and it is also raised to the touch.  You can pop the bottom in and out with very little pressure.  It looks much like the one I bought in the 1990s, but the quality is very inferior.  I feel that the claim of ""even heat distribution"" is false.

But the one I bought here in April of 2017....The bottom is so thin that you can take your hand and press on it and it moves back and forth and makes a little sound.

49;12.0;2.0;63.0;I ordered 2 of these 2-quart saucepans because I had owned them and liked them in the past.  I only threw them out after letting them boil dry and turn into molten lava.  The pans that I bought in September 2005 were manufactured in China and did not measure up to the past quality of those made in the USA and Korea.  The interiors are oddly rough and the knob on the top of one of the covers has a sharp edge.  These pans are worth the $15.33 I paid for each of them and not a penny more.;They don't make them like they used to

I have read other reviews that complain that the pan is ""light weight"" and ""made in China."" I found this pan to be of the same weight as my old pan with the same rivet construction and copper-clad base. The copper bottom is stamped ""Indonesia"" unlike my old version which is stamped ""Rome, NY.""

11;14.0;5.0;14.0;Ideal Choice of Saucepan\n\nDon't worry about the one star reviews. They almost scared me out of ordering. This pan looks like the real McCoy, has a 25 year warranty, and of course you do not turn the heat up all the way. With care, the pan should be very serviceable and just what I wanted. Thank you, Revere, for still having metal lids. We had a glass lid from another brand blow up on us, so I am banning glass lids from my kitchen for safety reasons. The 3-quart covered saucepan is just perfect for our Revere steamer especially made for it, so not replacing the pan was not an option. Also we find Revere washes beautifully in the dishwasher. When someone (not me) burns food on, it comes clean with SOS or stainless cleaner, unlike many other brands that have been destroyed in our kitchen. So I heartily recommend this product, even for beginner cooks.;This pan looks like the real McCoy
12;15.0;1.0;14.0;I'm so sad that the pot's bottom immediately made a big pop sound and became warped the first time I used it.  I had been using my grandparents' Revere pots for 20 years up until I had to get replacements.  This pot is made in Indonesia, not the U.S...and I noticed when I was taking it out of the box that it felt lighter even though it looked exactly the same.  The directions say  not to use on high heat nor dry heat.  Okay...I wish that had been mentioned in the site of the details of the pots.  What good is a pot if you can't use on high heat?  I'm so disappointed.  It's really difficult to find a 2 quart pot that is stainless steel at a reasonable price.  I thought I had hit the jackpot when I saw these pots for sale.  Thank goodness amazon is the great company it is.  As soon as I put in a request to return the pots, I received an email with a packing label and soon after, a refund.  I truly appreciate that efficiency and service.;Sad
24;16.0;1.0;33.0;"I have used Revere Ware copper clad pots and Farber aluminum pots for 42 years of marriage and two young girls who were hard on the pots.  The Farber aluminum clad pots all buckled from the differential expansion of the aluminum cladding relative to the steal body of the pot.  This took many years of use before all the aluminum clads became useless.  My Revere Ware copper clad pots are all as good as the day we got them in the 1960s!  So two weeks ago I decided to replace the worst of the buckled pots with new Revere Ware copper clad pots. What a mistake that was. Niced and shiny steel pots with a copper cladding for even heating.  After a few day I finely used them both, I put two inches of water in the two quart pot place some frozen vegetables in also.  Within minutes of heating the pot it suddenly buckled worse than any of my aluminum clad pots and of coarse heating took a long time due to the uneven base of the pot.  Unfortunately, I discarded the boxes etc before ever using the pots and now have to determine if Revere will replace. On the bright side my three quart Revere Ware pot has not buckled yet.\n\nHere are two observations, the China made pots from Revere are made of thinner copper and steel components and Revere has lost its reputation for producing quality products.  It is my fault for not having read the prior reviews before considering purchase of these pots.  If Revere is willing to degrade its flagship product of the last century for a little extra profit then how are we to trust any of their products. It is sad to see fine American brands degraded like this.\n\nWith the above said, lots of excellent products come from China, so this is not a China versus US made issue, its about what US manufactures are willing to do in order to make a bit more profit by sending proction oversas and reducing quality standards.  All my current computers and many other high tech items are made in China and they are excellent, this is about Revere Ware and its loss of quality.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revere-3514027-2-Quart-Covered-Saucepan/dp/B00005B5YZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revere 3514027 2-Quart Covered Saucepan</a>";Very Poor Quality
9;17.0;1.0;9.0;I bought this pot because it most closely matches the older Revere cookware that we have, which has a thick metal disk in the bottom.  We've used this pot twice.  I used it the second time and found that the bottom of the pot is thin (it has no metal disk) and is severely bowed out in the middle.  You can pretty much spin it like a top on a flat surface!  I tried to use it to make caramel, and because of the bow in the bottom, all of the heat is transferred to a tiny spot in the middle of the pot.  This makes it nearly impossible to bring anything to a boil, and if you succeed, you will burn the heck out of it in the center, and it will be cold around the edges.  Cooking on a blow torch would be easier.  I ended up having to change pots because I couldn't get the caramel to boil.  The bottom of the pot shows heat discoloration in the very center since that's the only part of the pot that touches the cook top and because you have to turn the burner up so high.  If you push on the bottom of the pot it pops in with a loud ping, and then pops back out when you release the pressure.  Having a copper bottom to distribute heat is great, but it doesn't help in this situation.  Save your money and buy something else.  I'll be throwing this one out.\n\nNote that we never put the pot in cold water when it was hot.;You can pretty much spin it like a top on a flat ...
28;18.0;1.0;26.0;"We were quite surprised at how thin the metal is.  The ""Revereware"" stamp on the copper bottom shows through very prominently from the inside of the pan (!).  It weighs much less than our old Revereware sauce pan.  Is the product just less durable now, or has ""built-in self-destruct so you have to buy a new one sooner"" policy crept in from the auto industry?\n  According to the info that came with the product, it was made in Indonesia.\n  We looked in several local stores but could not find Reverware at all, or could only find large sets, so we ordered it on-line here. Not worth it, it seems.\n  My wife says she won't buy Revereware anymore.";Metal sides, bottom are WAY too thin!
40;19.0;3.0;24.0;Our older Revereware pans are great, and part of the reason they're great is the really heavy bottom, which distributes heat evenly and extends the life of the pan.\n\nThis pan has a nice copper bottom, which is good for heat distribution I guess, but it's disappointingly thin.  It's not the quality it used to be, or so it seems to me.;A decent pan, but bottom is thin
47;20.0;1.0;24.0;Saucepan made in Indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely.  There was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit.  It was in the construction of the pan.  As a long time user of Revere Ware, we were very disappointed in this product sent to us.  We will never purchase another Revere Ware product.  Once burned we will not go back to a second treatment.;Saucepan made in Indonesia
39;21.0;2.0;20.0;This pan is not good quality. It is much lighter than the olds ones that were made in the USA! This is made in Indo-China and that should explain it all. Too bad that a product named after an American Patriot left the US to save money.;Not Good!
20;22.0;4.0;15.0;"As a great many other reviewers I grew up with Revere pots and pans in the house, though not the copper clad. Most of the pots and pans we had growing up had been around so long the handles were falling off or the phenolic knobs/handles pitted from much use, and still they were the ones we used. Yes, the new version is made over seas. No, nothing will ever be as good as the memories of childhood; how can anything be as good as our mothers' cooking! That being said, this product was exactly as I was expecting. It came well packaged without any perceivable damage. The bottom as well as the rest of the pan appear to be of acceptable thickness and quality of material. The lit fits uniformly, no it will not be a snug fit, but Revere has never claimed to have a lid that ""seals"". If I had wanted that I would have bought a pressure cooker. The copper bottom will visibly rainbow as all copper products do. You will have to take special care and use a stainless steel/copper cleaner such as Kleen King to remove the discoloration. I have such a cleaner already that I use for the sink. Use it every-time you wash your pan and you will always have a shiny copper bottom worthy of display!";Revere Review
42;23.0;1.0;17.0;This is a very light-weight pan with a lid that doesn't fit. I washed it just out of the box and left it to dry in the rack. Water spots lifted the copper plating from the bottom surface, exposing whatever the next layer of coating is. I then boiled water in it on my glass top range and the pan wobbled across the range top - the bottom surface isn't flat! Burned my hand on all of the steam escaping from under the lid. Revere should be ashamed of this product - manufactured in Indonesia.;Don't buy this saucepan!

38;25.0;5.0;15.0;This sauce pan is not massively thick, nor does it sport a huge ergonomically designed space-age rubber handle or industrial-size rivets. It also lacks the engraved name of a celebrity television chef. Yet when I fill it with water and apply heat to the bottom, the water boils. The amazing phenomenon of heating also occurs when food is placed in the pan. The finish is shiny, and the lid fits well. The pan and its lid can go in the dishwasher. I ask no more.;Fine Sauce Pan
21;26.0;1.0;12.0;My first Revere Ware 3-quart sauce pan is still perfect after twenty years of daily use.  I love it.  So, I decided to buy another, to have a second.  The new one came immediately, on-time--thanks AMAZON! It was almost visually identical to the older one. But, the inside finish was not smooth like my older model.  It was clearly turned, giving it grooves like an old phonograph record. The new one immediately warped on my glass-top stove.  So, no good.  I can't use anything but perfectly flat cookware on glass-top stove.  Gas stoves, probably OK, except those grooves are bound to be harder to clean than the perfectly smooth stainless steel of my old one.  I tried to find the Revere Ware's customer service on the Internet.  I think it is a brand of World Kitchen, now.  It seems evident to me that the new version is not as good, i.e., more cheaply made than the original.  The manufacturer has either intentionally or unintentionally let a wonderful product's quality deteriorate.  The new pan was manufactured in Indonesia.  I will be wary of poor quality in Revere Ware products in future shopping.  I would recommend avoiding ALL Revere Ware for everyone.  AMAZON.COM however, was great.  I had a return shipping label ready since it came with the pot and Amazon immediately credited my account for this crummy product. Yea! AMAZON.COM is GREAT!  I just wish there was a way to vet products beforehand.;Revere Ware Not What it used to be, but Amazon great!
14;27.0;1.0;6.0;Disappointed because Revere made the decision to have their product made in a thinner gauge steel, assumedly as a cost saving measure. Unfortunately it has already dented because of this. Sometimes decisions like this can lead to company failure. Instead, they should have strived to make their product better.

34;28.0;1.0;13.0;I was so relieved to find my beloved Revere pans online....until I got them in the mail. I have owned Revere pans for 32 years and my youngest pans are 12 years old. I wanted to replace some of the oldest ones, but after seeing the poor quality of these new Revere pans, I am sending them back. When I compared them to the pans in my kitchen, the new ones were lighter weight, thinner handles, and flimsy connections from the handle to the pan. So disappointing. These are a bad buy.;Not the same quality as years before
4;29.0;4.0;16.0;This pan gets the most use of any in my kitchen.  It's got a good depth so that when whisking sauces and gravies they don't spatter over the edge and mess up the cooking surface.  I especially like that there are inserts made to fit this pot, including the steamer which is less of a hassle than the old expandable baskets.  The lid fits nicely even after ten years.  This pan requires a little extra effort to keep looking nice, but a swipe with some copper/stainless steel cleaner keeps it looking pretty much like new.  Some sauces with a high milk content tend to burn slightly at the bottom.  This is a good basic saucepan.;good basic saucepan

16;32.0;5.0;6.0;The saucepan functions very well. Some reviewers don't like that it is lightweight and not made in the USA, but those factors don't bother me since the pan does what I need it to do. I've wanted Revere Ware since I got married 39 years ago, but someone gave me a nice set of Farberware. Then I changed to an expensive, non-stick set three years ago. However, it was heavy, took a long time to heat up, and did not stack well in my cupboard. I found myself using my mom's 65-year-old Revere Ware saucepan (which I received when she passed away) more and more, instead of the nonstick pans. I finally decided to treat myself to a set of Revere, and I added this saucepan to round out the set. True, these pans are a lot lighter than Mom's Revere Ware, but they cook just as effectively. I love that the pans are lightweight, because I have arthritis in my arms, wrists, and hands. I also like the Revere warranty. I had a warranty issue with one pan in the set I bought, and the company replaced it within a few days. I periodically make the copper bottoms of the pans shiny again by coating them with ketchup and letting it sit for a few minutes, then rinsing.

18;36.0;3.0;6.0;I hadn't bought any Revere Ware copper-bottom pans for about 30 years, and the new generation is quite different. The material is lighter-weight and cooks well, and the handle and knob on the lid don't get hot at all. But the downside is, it needs a LOT more care! The pan had to be washed and 'seasoned' (rubbed with cooking oil) before it could be used--and they recommend you 'season' it again, from time to time. Unlike with the older pans, now you have to wait until the pan cools off before putting water in it. And the manual warns that if you put the lid on while lowering the heat, a dangerous vacuum could form, and you can't risk taking off the lid yourself but have to contact the manufacturer. (Talk about inducing paranoia!).\n\nAll copper-bottom Revere Ware pans need copper polish to make them spiffy. But now this one needs non-abrasive steel polish to get rid of the 'rainbow effect' heat-induced discoloration that forms in the bottom of the pan.

Paul Revere was all about the United States of America.  That's number 1.  Number 2 is: I noticed some differences between the made in Indonesia pot and the pot that was made in Clinton, Illinois, namely that the Indonesian pot is lighter in weight, the handle really does look like it would burn more easily and would break more easily than the sturdy handle on the pots manufactured in the USA.  And the inside for some reason doesn't seem to be as smooth.\n\nSo, hopefully, I can somehow find my way to the money it'll take to buy some USA made steel pots from Pennsylvania that I saw in a local shop.

41;46.0;1.0;6.0;"At least one of the reviews referred to the heat conductivity of the copper-bottom pot. Uh, wrong. The thin flash of copper on the Revere pots is for appearance's sake. If you want smooth, even heat you have to find the pots with the aluminum disk bonded to the bottom. Several years ago, Consumer Reports did a piece on this with thermographs of the bottoms of the different types of pot; if you're interested and in particular if anyone wants to argue the merits of Revere's copper-coated pots, it'll take some digging but it's worth it.\nRepeat: copper-bottom stainless is WORTHLESS for evening the heat.";Copper-bottom Revere Ware
25;47.0;3.0;5.0;They don't make Revere Ware like they did 30 years ago. Hard to clean, need to use steel wool. Fast delivery. It says 25 year warranty on the box. It might last that long if you don't use it. Sorry, but it's not a good product. But, a good seller.;fast delivery
32;48.0;3.0;5.0;I had been looking for a 1 quart Revere pot to add to the ones I already had for many years.  I looked in many stores here in San Jose Ca and could not find one.  I checked on line and found one offered on Amazon and decided since I had done business with you before, I felt safe in ordering.  The product came in a timely manner and I have no complaints with Amazon but the pot was not as good as the Revere I had for many years.  It was not made in the USA but in SerLanka or somewhere overseas.  It is not as heavy a pot as my old ones and and the bottom is not smooth but rippled.  I have used it but do not think it will last as long as the ones I have had for over 30 years that still look and act new.;Semi satisfied
3;49.0;5.0;5.0;My mother had one of these saucepans and used it daily as far back as I can remember for everything from boiling potatoes to making gravy.  When she passed away I took it and use it all the time.  It came witha double boiler insert which also got (and gets) frequest use, particularly for melting chocolate.  My pan has to be at least 50 years old, the handle is still tight and the cover still seals.  It's as good as they day Mom bought it half a century or more ago.  What more could you ask?;This is IT!

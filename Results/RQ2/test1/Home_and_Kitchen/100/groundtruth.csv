3;1.0;5.0;533.0;The two best convection toaster ovens I found for the quality and the money were the Delonghi AS670 and the Quisinart TBO-165. After many hours of research I settled on the Quisinart TBO-165. Both have a half cubic foot of space and two rack positions, but the Quiainart offers a drip tray for the fat to drip through for healthier eating. The thing that sold me on the Quisinart was the clock, oven shut off timer and the toast setting memory that Delonghi did not have. The Delonghi has an automatic shut off for toast only. The white Delonghi has a black face plate, but the Quisinart is all white. Some convection toaster oven doors have air gaps all around, both of these brand's doors shut snuggly and both doors open in the down position which is safer than doors that open sideways. If you prefer the Delonghi you'll need to rememeber when to shut the oven off.;Quisinart Tops Out

Stop looking for a near perfect toaster oven.  We, finally, found it.  After five years of aggregation, we've found it.\nTo give you ideas of some of the wasted time, etc.: 1. We literally in a matter of a few weeks bought and returned two toaster ovens.  Then we just settled for the least of the evils we found at Walmart. 2. It lasted about six months until it burned out and we returned it to the mfr. and received a new one.  3. The new toaster oven lasted about a year until one morning it popped and spit sparks.  We actually had never really liked this unit because the controls were hard to read and the heating erratic.  By the way, we had carried out a great deal of research both on Consumers Report's web site and the reviews on the Amazon web site before we ever bought the first toaster oven.\nWell, one more time we researched toaster ovens and reluctantly decided we had to up grade to a more expensive model and so decided to give the Cusinart TOB 165 (This is the white version) a try.  Oh, my gosh!  It is wonderful!  After four months we have not found anything wrong.  It is a pleasure to use it at least three times a day.  It is easy to operate and performs perfectly.";At last a perfect toaster oven
0;3.0;5.0;174.0;"I have a toaster oven graveyard out in my dumpster. I was buying name brands and subjecting them to only moderate use, yet we were going through the things faster than pet goldfish.\nFor my most recent purchase I decided to pay for top quality. I based my purchase decision on my experience with other Cuisinart products and extensive reading of reviews from many sources. I've had my oven for about six months now, and I've been heartily pleased with my selection.\nBesides durability, my chief concern in shopping had been size. It turns out this is even bigger than what I had before--both wide and tall. I can fit Corningware pans with the domed lids and knobs on top. Yet the outer dimensions are quite modest.\nI wasn't sure I would use the convection feature, and in fact didn't get around to it until last week. It produced an excellent roast chicken, and I probably will use it more and more to make ""weekend"" dishes during the week. The additional cost for the convection over the regular was small, so it's definitely worth it even for occasional use.\nThe oven itself functions admirably. I love that it beeps when it's fully preheated, and the heat sensor really does keep it constantly and evenly heated to the correct temperature. I'm using this much more than my regular oven, especially during the summer.\nThe controls are easy to use and well thought-out as far as flow and intuitive functions. The only thing I'm not crazy about is setting the timer--one press for every minute, one for every hour. Gets to be a pain when you're setting 45 minutes. But, that is balanced out by the fact that the timer alarm keeps beeping until you come turn it off. No one little ""ding"" that you miss because you've stepping into the other room for a minute, leaving your food to burn.\nToasting is uneven as noted elsewhere, but this is typical of toaster ovens. Adjusting the rack can help. And honestly, it's really only an aesthetic problem. I do like that the toasting fuction includes a countdown timer so you know how long until breakfast!\nMy only real complaint lies with the broiler pan. Upon first inspection out of the box I was pleased with its apparent quality. But on the very first use it warped, and now buckles significantly on every use. Further, after the first washing I took it out of the drying rack only to discover rust along the bottom edge where water had pooled. I didn't even think it could rust, let alone do it on its first contact with water. I have to think my specific pan is lemon, as for them all to be like this would just be inexcusable in a product of such otherwise impeccable quality.\nAlso, the design team really fell apart when it came to the oven rack on which this pan sits. The rack--at least in one of its positions--actually wraps around the front corners of the pan. This means in order to take the pan out of the oven you have to lift it 1/2"" vertically over the rack. Lift it and whatever's on it, plus whatever hot grease has accumulated, with nothing to grab it by. The other option is to take the rack out with it, which means tilting everything 30 degrees to get it past the stops. Not only is this bad design, it's dangerous.\nBut since I'm not using the pan every day, and since I love everything else about it, I'll still give it five stars.";Great oven, bad broiler tray
90;4.0;3.0;115.0;This is an excellent product except for two glaring problems.  1. One of the most important features of this oven is the timer feature.  That was the deciding feature for us. Unfortunately, the timer fails to do the single most important feature of a timer attached to an oven -- it does NOT turn off the oven when the BAKING or BROILING time runs out!\n2. The manual recommends cleaning the top inner surface (heat reflector) of the oven after broiling or baking.  Unfortunately, there is no practical means of doing this because the top inner reflector cannot be removed for cleaning and the upper heat elements are in the way of cleaning.\nIn our opinion, these are both glaring design oversights in an otherwise good product.;Great product -- except for ...
58;5.0;1.0;72.0;This product worked great...for 3 weeks.\n\nWhen I needed it repaired Cuisinart couldn't or would not send out repair parts to my USA address.\n\nNope. Send it back, at huge expense.\n\nTo make matters worse you can't reply to their email, NO you have to go to their site and send an email by filling in the blanks.\n\nCompare this to Calphalon, Bosch or KitchenAid, all of which I have dealt with in the past 2 years and the message is clear. Don't buy a Cuisinart product if you expect service after the sale. Their competitors make comparable products and actually service their customers so it makes no sense to buy Cuisinart.;Great product.................. horrible service
28;6.0;5.0;47.0;We previously had a DeLonghi toaster oven, which we really liked ever since purchasing it about 13 or so years ago. I liked it so much that my parents bought a similar DeLonghi model a few years later. Unfortunately, their model very quickly developed defective knobs that were positionally indefinite or would stick on - not good folks! Recently, ours developed a sticky knob syndrome. After the second piece of toast catching fire in the kitchen I threw the toaster oven out (regrettably). Its a shame because it did a pretty good job and we gladly used it several times every day. Toast, chicken, fish, roasting vegetables, ... loved it! Hardly ever needed our regular oven.\n\nWe started researching convection toaster ovens. Some of the newer DeLonghi reviews complained of an initial smell that we wanted to inspect for ourselves. The smell concern is indeed mentioned in their manual. This made us seriously wonder what they were imparting into our food over time.\n\nThe Cuisinart had no such issue. It also had glowing reviews. We tried finding it in the stores to get a first-hand sense of the product. Unfortunately we could not find it anywhere.\n\nAfter reading many reviews and considering what Consumer Reports had to say, we decided to get the white Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven. Right out of the box it works great and has ever since! Toast, are you kidding? I've never seen toast so smoothly toasted before. It almost looks like someone used a spray can to paint a browned look on it. Consistent, dependable, precise settings - you know what to expect from it. It even takes advantage of it being previously heated to calculate (measure the temp for you) the remaining amount of time required to toast another piece precisely the way you'd expect it - smart! Efficient that way. It also lets you know when the target temp has been reached - useful prior to baking some things - very nice indeed.\n\nWe've noticed how it seems to bring out more of the flavor of the food (fish or chicken, for example) than what we've experienced with our previous toaster oven. Wow! What an unanticipated plus! We can smell and taste more of the subtle aspects of our food.\n\nThe controls are a breeze and easy to adapt to. The oven produces what I'd call a professional grade result. I really appreciate the thought and science that must have gone into engineering this product to enhance my cooking experience. Its got my glowing vote!!!\n\nTip: I saved the previous toaster oven's rack and crumb tray for potential future use. Turns out that it was an excellent idea. A second rack affords the opportunity of baking twice the items as long as what you're baking can comfortable fit in between them. The old bread crumb tray (stainless steel) is excellent for cooking anything that won't produce much liquid and can benefit from more open space (cookies, roasting vegetables, burgers for example). Buying these items would probably cost $20 or so, assuming you'd be inclined to do so. Reuse and recycle! I love it!;Great Convection Toaster Oven - Extremely Happy With It!
95;7.0;5.0;73.0;After reading the reviews here, I expected to be impressed by the baking features, but disappointed by the toasting abilities.  I wasn't disappointed at all, but then again I don't require that my toast be equally brown on both sides.\nThe owner's manual explains that the goal in toasting is to achieve the ideal combination of browning and dryness.  The Cuisinart TOB-165 achieves this, I think, by not cooking the underside too much.  The result is delicious toast that is not dried out too much, but is firm enough on the bottom to easily spread butter or condiments - such as when you want to use the toast for a sandwich.\nThe ability to defrost and perfectly toast a bagel is truly awesome.  Again, not dried out, but a great toasted taste nonetheless.\nI convection baked a 4.5 lb chicken in an hour.  Because of the convection feature, it was evenly browned rather than the weird birds you pull out of a standard oven that are brown on top but unpleasantly pale on the sides.\nI convection baked small potatoes in 45 minutes.  The insides were nice and soft, and the skin had a good texture.\nI have not had the problems described in some of the other reviews, for the most part.  For instance, my broiler pan has not warped.  I agree it is difficult to remove over the lip of the rack when pulling it from the oven, but you can finesse it with practice.\nThe claim in another review that this oven has no automatic shut-off is absolutely wrong.  This safety information can even be found on the outside of the box, although you have to look for it.  The oven will turn itself off after four hours.\nThis is a wonderful oven to supplement your standard one.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes they had a second oven, but doesn't want to pay to install a wall oven.;Even better than I expected!
62;8.0;1.0;44.0;Do yourself a favor!!!!!!  Do not buy this inferior product!!!  I rated it one star simply because there is no lower rating to assign it. I am totaly shocked that Cuisinart would have this on the market.  The convection oven is fine, but the toaster is absolutely terrible.  My $20 Black and Decker out performed this poor excuse for a toaster.  The bottom heating elements do not work properly, therefore giving you a piece of bread that is half toasted.  If you do not mind turning the bread over two or three times, you might possibly be happy with the results.  Cuisinart offered to replace the product, but what is the sense.  From reading other reviews, most all of the TOB-165's have this malfunction.  Also, you have to pay shipping for the new one.  By the way, do not look for any help from Amazon. They will tell you that it is up to you and the manufactuer to work it out. (I am not sure this review will get posted after that comment.) I am finished buying appliances on line. I have learned my lesson.  My hope is that you will heed my warning and not purchase this product.;Please Read
83;9.0;4.0;44.0;I've owned at least 10 different toaster ovens over the years. I've had my Cuisinart for about 2 years now. It is by far the best one I've ever owned. It hasn't discolored, it still works just fine. Get a clue, people. Toaster ovens aren't meant for baking!\nThis oven works quickly and evenly for roasting chicken and making baked potatoes. It broils well. It's so-so (like all toaster ovens) for toast. Does a pretty good bagel.\nIf you have to have a toaster oven that turns itself off with the timer, get something else, because this one just beeps, but that's enough for me.\nThe convection feature really does speed up cooking and I love all the toast cycles, such as bagel, defrost, 4 slices, etc. The rewarm button is handy as well.\nFor my money, this toaster oven has the most features and is the most consistent. It's not been a problem to clean, either.\nBut geez, make your wedding cake in a real oven. The nature of a toaster oven is that with such a small cavity, it's going to overbrown anything you attempt to bake. I've never owned a toaster oven, no matter how big, that baked well.;Since when can you bake in a toaster oven?
72;10.0;3.0;39.0;Revision:\n\nI posted a mediocre review for this toaster oven after a short time of using it. There are things you learn the user's manual does not tell you.\n\nExample. Toast sucks in it, unless you move the rack to the middle position. Then it is near perfect. Go figure. Logical, but it took a while to figure it out. :-o\n\nAnyway, this thing gets used for EVERYTHING. We use it to cook in place of our oven whenever what we are cooking fits.\n\nAnd the fan noise in convection mode I complained about died down after about three months to almost nothing. Quiet now. Go figure. Guess it needed breaking in.\n\nTwo complaints.\n\n1. No auto shutoff. Just beeps when the food is done. But it doesn't shut off. I don't like that in a small oven. Don't think it is all that safe.\n\n2. Would be OH SO MUCH EASIER to clean if the door was removable. It isn't.\n\nOld Review:\nI have had at least half a dozen toaster ovens.  From the cheapest at $20. to this one at $149.  Every one made LOUSY TOAST.  So, you need a toaster.  This one is no exception.  Lousy uneven toast.\n\nAll the toaster ovens that I had were tough to clean.  No exception here.  The door gets greasy and cannot be removed.  Little bits of food get stuck here and there, and, well, you have an interesting time extracting it.\n\nThe convection oven idea is cute.  Sounds like a helicopter though.  Really, extremely loud fan.  Never heard anythign like it.  I almost never use it because the noise is unbearable in my apartment.\n\nNow, is it a great small oven.  You bet.  I think it works dandy and it is bigger than most of the cheaper units so it holds more.  I have cooked everythign in this, but as with most toaster ovens its specialty is warming up yesterday's pizza.\n\nThe size of this oven, though, can be had at a lower price, around $40-$50.  And the thing has no timer shutoff.  Has an electronic timer that will beep at you to take the food out, but if you forget to turn it off, this thing will stay on until the cows come home, you discover it is on and shut it off or your house burns to the ground.\n\nOne of the best things about cheap toaster ovens is that when they get aggravating enough, too dirty or just plain stop working, chucking them is almost a pleasure.  The cost of this one takes away that advantage of the cheap toaster oven with little to offer except size in return.\n\nSo, if you want a second mini-oven to bake things and reheat, this is a good oven for that, but there are better.  As a convection oven, it makes too much noise, and as a toaster, well, it is abominable.;Definitel worth over a hundred bucks...
87;11.0;1.0;41.0;"I read all the reviews from Amazon.com prior to purchasing this expensive addition to my kitchen.  I am starting to believe that most of the 5 star ratings were written by people who work for Cuisnart.  I have tried every rack position and cannot bake biscuits in this oven.  They burn on top and do not get brown on the bottom.  I have tried other items in this oven and I am very disappointed in the results.  And yes, it is a ""PAIN"" to try to keep clean.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!!!!! I'm giving mine to the Goodwill.  The only thing it does well is broil but there is no timer.  Still you have to deal with the mess.  And forget about toast.\n\nI also purchased Cuisnart's small food processor that has the holes in the cap in which you pour your oil in to make different salad dressings. Don't bother.  The holes that are designed to let the oil slowly mix in are constantly plugging up...thereby making another mess. So..................\n""I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISNART PRODUCTS !""";I agree with all the previous one star comments and more...
39;12.0;3.0;30.0;This is an excellent toaster oven.  Toast even tastes better toasted in this machine -- if you can beleive it.  I was surprised too.  HUGE downside:  the metal tray does not slide out causing you to stick your hand into the hot oven when your toast is done.  I have already burned the top of my hand a few times trying to get the toast out of the hot oven.;Beware of burning your fingers
60;13.0;4.0;32.0;Pros:\nThe small foot print is perfect for the small (and I do mean small) amount of counter space.\nThe three-year warranty is tops.\nThe quality of the baking and 'convectioning' (is that a word?) cannot be beat.  It rules all over a toaster oven.\nAlways go with the solid state digital controls if posible.  This one has them.\nThe temp is 'right on' according to the Taylor oven thermometer.  However, it takes a little longer to reach the temp set than the 'beeps' would indicate.\n\nCons:\nReally should have put a non-stick finish on the drip pan and drip pan top.  Even the RONCO Showtime has that. Of course a good shot of oven cleaner brings it back (but at what cost?).\nThis is a bear to clean.  'Gunk' gets under the door edge and there is no provision to remove the door and clean it.  Thus, the old 'toothpick' routine must be employed.\nShould have built this so that the crumb tray pulls out the front rather than from the rear.\n\n11/05/06:  Have ordered a DiLongi 2-rack convection oven.  It was only $79 so maybe it won't work worth a darn.  However, if it does work, I will faithfully report how much better it does than the Cuisinart.;Probably closer to 4 1/2 stars...
78;14.0;4.0;36.0;"We have owned this oven now for about one half year and are very satisfied with it.  Perhaps its best fit into our life is as a full-sized oven substitute for smaller (actually indeed most) things.  The temperature control is very accurate (measured it, and generally within 10 degrees of setpoint).  We almost always use the convection feature for very even heating.  Perhaps the best example is when baking brownies (a 9x9 pan fits) - compared with out full oven, the brownies are done more evenly, without a tough crust.\nOnly three things keeping this from 5 stars:\n1) that it toasts quite slowly (3 minutes) - but the toast is done evenly, if you like crispy outside and soft inside.\n2) It has a timer, but this simply beeps when the time is up - it does not turn itself off (a shame)\n3) The user interface is straightforward, but contains a few strange quirks. When you press ""Bake"", you have to follow it with hitting the ""temperature"" button if you want anything other than 250 degrees - they could eliminate that button press.\nAll told we are very happy and would recommend it to our friends. And the price is quite good for what you get.";Wonderful even heating, toasts slowly
48;15.0;3.0;29.0;"After reading all the excellent reviews of this product, I had very high expectations. I am somewhat disappointed. I've had the oven for about a month and have made roasted asparagus, frozen waffles, and toast in it, all of which came out fine. However, I have also tried to make scones and cookies and those have not come out well at all. The scones browned very unevenly (despite the convection feature) and I had to use some foil as a heat shield, take them out and put them back in several times, etc. The cookies just cook in their original doughball shape and never flatten out -- they're done on the outside and barely cooked inside. I've tried both baking rack positions and different temperatures and times and got the same result. (Both of these recipes are 'old standbys' that I never had a problem with in my regular oven.) Maybe toaster ovens just aren't the thing to use for baked goods.\n\nThe User Guide does not provide suggestions on when to use which baking position. It provides some recipes and tells which position to use for each one, but does not provide any guidelines. I tried checking all the recipes to figure it out, but some baked goods use the middle rack position while others use the lower rack position, and I couldn't find a rhyme or reason to the difference.\n\nLastly, I find the controls are not that intuitive. I work in high-tech and am a ""usability enthusiast"" and so it annoys me that I keep finding myself pressing the wrong buttons. For example, if I press ""Convection Bake,"" the initial temp. is 150F. I should just be able to press the ""Up"" arrow to increase it, right? No, I have to hit the ""Temp"" button first. After setting the temperature you'd think the oven would start heating, right?  No, you have to press the ""Start"" button, which I sometimes forget to do. These extra steps have tripped me up many times.\n\nI'm a firm believer in having good tools for the job and I own some other high-end appliances. But if I had this purchase to do over again, I probably would buy something less expensive and just expect it not to bake very well.";Poor results for baked goods

12;17.0;5.0;21.0;"The Cuisinart Convection oven with Exact Heat is one of the finest kitchen products I have had the privilege of owning in the last decade (beside perhaps All-Clad cookware and Shun knives). It has literally changed my life and how I eat and what foods I can prepare--and prepare to perfection to boot, my friends!\n\nI live in a bachelor apartment (no stove or oven), which for an active cook is hard. I had been struggling with a Cuisinart Classic toaster oven, and it was hard; burnt foods on the top, raw on the bottom; then after two years of use, only the broil function worked. My faith in Cuisinart products was nil.\n\nIn researching what new oven to buy, I was shocked (and quite dismayed) to find a Cuisinart product so highly rated and loved by it's owners--how could this be, from the toaster oven devils themselves?! I was NOT, darn it, about to purchase another Cuisinart product, No SireeeBob! Let alone one for $150! But the endless glowing reviews here at Amazon and elsewhere on the net convinced me to put the last of my faith in another bout with Cuisinart. The reviews on this oven were just so glowing and up--it was hard to find anyone who had anything bad to say about this product; owner after owner after owner raved over this oven...\n\nWell, I am pleased to report all the accolades for this small oven are true, and my faith was well invested. I can finally bake again! And not just bake, but bake like I have never done before, even with big gas ovens. Chocolate chip cookies, roasted green beans and butternut squash, biscuits, frozen lasagna, whole chickens, home made bread from scratch--it all comes out WONDERFULLY! Browned to perfection, evenly baked--the convection feature and the Exact Heat technology on this oven is nothing short of amazing.\n\nIt has honestly brought a tear to this bachelor's eye to be able to bake anything with confidence.\n\nI roasted a 4lb. whole chicken for my mom on Mothers Day, and she agreed that not only did it look the part of an all over golden brown piece of poultry perfection, but that it's taste lived up to it's looks--juicy and perfectly done under the crisp and crackling but not dried-out skin ( and it cooked in 50 minutes to boot).\n\nI have only toasted one bagel so far, so I do not have the experience to report on the toasting features of this oven, however the bagel did come out very nice indeed, and the oven boasts some extensive toasting features.\n\nI have found the best success with the convection feature by reducing the recipes (or instructions) recommended temperature by 25%, and also reducing the baking time by 25-30%.\n\nIf you are contemplating a toaster-convection oven, despite some horrible experiences with Cuisinart in the past, I wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful and God-send oven with great enthusiasm! You won't be sorry, and in fact, you may come to hate your regular oven, and come to wish as I do that Cuisinart would make a model that was just a tad bigger to accommodate 13"" bakeware...!";Amazing Oven!

It just simply will not toast the under side of the bread, although it does a great job on the top side. Even lowering the rack doesn't help. I talked to Cuisinart and they were no help at all; said they get a lot of complaints and that you should lower the rack to the bottom. Well, I did that, and still no browning.

41;20.0;3.0;24.0;This appliance was great while it lasted.  It makes very good baked potatoes.  Otherwise, convection feature is a waste.  Recipies must be adapted for convection and it is more art than scientific process.  Even convection recipes require adaptation for use in this tiny oven.  My appliance still works, but heat  damaged the enamel around the door over 2 years of use.  The paint is flaking off to reveal metal underneath.

For small meals or children, it's a must.  I love to watch the mouths of my friends fall open when they see how fast I can get a good hot meal ready for my kiddos.

70;23.0;5.0;25.0;"I decided to buy this toaster oven on the strength of it's reviews here,as well as, it's ""cousin"" model (#TOB-175BC) which was ranked #1 by consumer reports. The 20$ off promo and free shipping from Amazon was the selling point for me. (Final cost 110, it lists for 220) The only difference I noticed between the two is that this one is white and the other is black/chrome. The 175BC model is also 50$+ more expensive. I wanted this one primarily because of the convection feature, that's a new technology in toaster ovens. I also liked the removable crumb tray, non-stick interior, and digital touch pad controls.\n\n  I understand these are more expensive than most of the other toaster ovens on the market and that may drive a lot of ppl elsewhere, however Cuisinart has apparently built a quality one here and the 3yr warranty shows they are willing to stand behind it. I agree w/ other reviewers that mentioned cuisinart should've added some insulation to prevent the top from getting extremely hot. If they can do it for regular toasters why not toaster ovens too? Maybe it's a cost cutting thing, but it would make this product safer. I agree that they could have added interior(LED)lights, backlit LCD, and also auto shutoff after the timer expires makes good practical sense. Making it larger than .5 cu.ft.is also good, Cuisinart. I look forward to their next gen. models, hopefully they will make it even better.\n\n  I've read a lot of reviews from ppl complaining about how toaster ovens toast bread. Personally, I don't think that's what toaster ovens should be used for, although it can. I have a regular toaster for that purpose. I mainly wanted a toaster oven because I liked the fact I wouldn't need to use the BIG oven and heat the whole house.(especially important during the summer!) I'm guessing it may even use less electricity, which also is a plus. I sometimes eat frozen foods ,which I bake, and this will be perfect for that. Also great for cooking/reheating pizza up to 9"" and chicken up to 4.5lbs!\n\n  Anyways, hope my review helps. I recommend this model(TOB-165). Happy cooking & Thanks Amazon!";Top Notch toaster oven
88;24.0;5.0;28.0;My large electric oven is terribly unreliable temperature wise.  It's just hot in there.  I did all the shopping around, all the price comparisons and reviews.  I've had my Cuisinart food processor for about 25 years and it's still great so I thought going with the Cuisinart couldn't be a mistake.  And it wasn't.  It's surprising what can fit in this small oven.  I've made breads, cakes, cookies, a chicken, Indian pudding, Irish soda bread and more.  Everything comes out perfectly.  (I don't use it for toast--I have a Rowenta for that.)  You might need a couple new pans or baking dishes, rounder more than longer is the key.  I got some unglazed quarry tiles at Lowe's for 77 cents each and put them on the rack.  You can make a single size pizza right on them and I leave them in all the time.  Why spend ... for a commercial pizza stone?  The oven heats in about 2 min. so easy, so fast.  I use the convection oven when I'm starving and can't wait the extra time of normal cooking.  The touch pad is great.  There's a small learning curve in getting used to it but once you do, you will realize what a waste a big oven is unless you are regularly cooking peacocks, or the hind quarters of buffalos.  No regrets to this purchase and if it lasts half the time of the food processor, I'll be a very happy girl.;Replaces a large oven for 95% of your cooking tasks
99;25.0;5.0;29.0;After going through two DeLonghi toaster ovens (both timer switches failed) I decided to try the Cuisinart, after reading the reviews here. All I can say is that this is the best product of its kind. Very easy controls. Toasting and baking are consistent. And it comes with a great warranty - which I will probably never need. Excellent workmanship and functionality. This is so much better than the DeLonghi it is well worth the price.;Great product
25;26.0;5.0;17.0;Couldn't ask for a better toaster oven. clean up is a breeze- the pans are solid stainless steel, not that teflon crap, and the crumb tray easily slides out the back to wipe off. my mother in law roasted a large chicken in this the first night with the convection feature and it was better than a fancy restaurant. the cord is shorter, but if you read the booklet, that's to prevent kids, pets, etc. from playing with it and knocking th toaster over while cooking (my guess is too many law suits from careless people). In fact they recommend you unplug when not in use. it's long enough, however, to completely spin the toaster oven around to take out the tray, so I don't get the complaint below. I have used it almost every day since we got it and never needed to consult the booklet on how to do something because it's so easy to figure out. everything comes out perfectly, it has quality stamped all over it (now watch it break on me tomorrow!) and looks great in the white color (which is alot cheaper:).\n\nwould definitely buy again, and consider purchasing more cuisinart bproducts because of this great machine- i just hope their customer service is as good as kitchenaid if i ever need to use it.;fabulous. couldn't expect better!
22;27.0;5.0;16.0;I read the reviews, searched the web for information and decided to purchase from my trusted Amazon. The package arrived in great condition, using three boxes for safty. I read the instructions, very simple, set it up on the counter top where it fit perfectly and plugged it in.\n\n1- Made some toast using the toast guide. WOW! I like my toast on the dark side and this thing and its setting guide made a whole new toast experience for me. Good by old toaster, well it's in storage. That feature works perfect.\n\n2- That same night I roasted a nice boneless pork roast, you know the kind where you stick some garlic in. Preheated the oven and set the oven for convection at 350 degrees. The smell began to make my mouth water. I threw in some sliced potatoes, onions and baby carrots sprinkled with some olive oil and salt and pepper wrapped in foil, yes there was room. Results? Excellent. Just remember to let the roast stand for a while so juices stay in. Hint! Use a sheet of foil to line the roasting pan for easier clean up.\n\n3- On to the broil test. Steak, steak and more steak, that's my motto. Placed a nice rib eye on the broiler pan stuck it in the oven, left the door ajar as recommened and turned the steak once. I honestly have to tell you, it's probably one of the best steaks I have ever had.\n\nPros- Style, interior and exterior size, easy controls, does everything it says it will do. and price value. Easy clean up inside and out. I live alone and using the large oven never made sense to me. This is a gem and I haven't used the main oven since having this in the house.\n\nCons- I am afraid my house keeper will take it if I don't keep an eye on her and eventually will have to leave it to my estate when I go, or maybe I'll take it with me.;Totaly surprised
34;28.0;3.0;18.0;This has been a great little unit for 3 years.  However, after a few months, it gets discolored on the top over the door.  After 2 years, the finish cracks and chips.  I am looking to replace it because it's so unsightly.  Too bad, because it still works very well.;Good product - but don't buy white
44;29.0;2.0;19.0;This is a fine oven but a terrible toaster. I read all these reviews about how great this one was, and I do like digital controls. Since I anticipate to use this item 50% for toasting, I am totally dissatisfied that this product DOES NOT TOAST THE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE BREAD! The top is fine, the bottom is practically unchanged. If you set it to a higher toast setting, the top gets too brown before the bottom starts to brown. Happens even if you set the rack to a lower level (I would not set it to the bottommost setting since that's practically on top of the lower elements. The bottom elements do glow orange, only slightly, not nearly as much as the top ones glow. I have read other reviews which had the same complaint but given all the other positive reviews, I chaulked them up to just people who didn't know what they were doing. THEY WERE RIGHT. If you want a toaster that toasts both sides, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.\n\nPS: My other complaint, if you open the door while the oven is working (toast or oven or broil setting), the heating elements do not shut off - very unsafe.;Does not toast both sides!
82;30.0;5.0;23.0;I'm a big fan of doing a lot of cooking in my toaster oven, since I am single and generally cook just for myself. I had an old, large toaster oven and had not been able to find a good replacement for it although I've been looking for years. My fullsize oven is convection and I knew it does a great job with meat in particular, but just hate cooking small meals in there and wasting all that energy. So when I saw this oven, I knew I had to get it! It's a bit pricey, but now that I have it, I don't regret the purchase at all. Hard to pass up with free shipping ...as well!\n\nFirst, it's nice and roomy inside. I think it's as big as my old one, it just doesn't look it from the outside. Looks great on the counter, very modern and built well. The controls look a little intimidating at first, and you will have to read the manual to figure them out, but after using them a couple times, it's pretty straightforward. The toasting features are incredible! I am real picky about my toast and bagels, can't stand them over-toasted and black and this oven did a perfect job with them from the first try!\n\nAs for the convection features, I've done pork and chicken so far and they turned out great. It takes a little getting used to in terms of cooking temperatures and times, but when done correctly, your food will be wonderfully moast and yummy. I particularly like being able to set a timer which will turn the oven off automatically, I've not seen a toaster oven with this feature before, and it definitely help to keep from overcooking food.\n\nThe oven comes with a nice large broiler pan, but you may want to look around...for other toaster oven pans, as once you have this, you will find yourself using it a lot! I probably use mine at least 1-2 times a day.\n\nUpdate - Well, I'm still using my toaster oven almost 5 years later and still loving it! It's easy to clean with a slide-out crumb tray and just works beautifully. I love the convection to do some quick browning at the end of cooking frozen foods and such, and for toasting bagels, muffins, whatever, it just can't be beat. Clearly it stands the test of time and should give you many years of use.;More than just a toaster oven!
71;31.0;4.0;20.0;"After reading all (yes, all of them) the reviews here on the Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven, I ordered it in white and waited with anticipation its arrival. I was pleasantly surprised that the oven was smaller than what I expected. But it is large enough to hold a round pie plate or 7"" by 11"" baking pan, and other baking pans that I have.\nTo date I have baked cornbread, baked a breakfast casserole, convection baked chicken and pork ribs, made toast, re-heated leftovers, cooked a frozen pizza, and baked a quesadilla. It is very possible I will hardly ever have to turn on my other full size range oven. This little oven does it all!\nSomeone mentioned the fan noise? What noise? The fan is so quiet I wondered if it were on at all. I'm trying to get in the habit of cleaning the inside everytime I roast or broil something that splatters. I unplug the oven when finished and open the door to speed cooling. Then after I eat my meal, I clean the oven with a hot, damp cloth when I clean up the dishes. I leave the door open to help dry the inside. I took the advice of a poster here and put the user's manual in the cabinet directly over the oven so it is always handy.\nIf you usually just cook for 1, 2, or 3 - this is an appliance you should have. I can't wait to broil my first steak, cook a whole small chicken, and bake homemade bread in my new oven! And not heat up the whole kitchen when the summer temps hit 94 like they did today!";A gem of a toaster oven!
17;32.0;5.0;14.0;"I purchased this item based on the rating in Consumer Reports as it was the top rated Toaster Oven.  It is so much better than our previous Convection Toaster Oven (a Euro-Pro) which was only a year old that it was not even close by comparison.  The convenience of the digital settings and timer is wonderful and the speed, eveness, and control of the cooking is truly excellent.  It is as fast toasting as a regular toaster which is very unusual for a convection toaster oven.  It is compact on the outside with good capacity on the inside so you get as much or more cooking space without taking up the extra counter space.  It cost more than our last three toaster ovens combined but it is ten times better; in this case you really do get what you pay for.  Highly recommend this item.";Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, White
92;33.0;5.0;23.0;I had never before owned a toaster oven and was relying heavily on these Amazon reviews to help me with my decision making.  My husband wanted a 4 slice toaster and I wanted a toaster oven.  This toaster oven exceeds our requirements.\nIt is extremely easy to use.  My 9 & 6 year old children quickly adapted to it.  They now love to make cheese toast.  Wooden tongs have been helpful to them for removing their toast.\nOn some toaster ovens, the tray automatically advances when the door is open.  This one does not.  A regular pie plate can fit inside.  Its front panel wipes clean easily.\nOverall I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The price was high but I firmly believe you get what you pay for.;First-Timer Goes Top-Of-The-Line
63;34.0;3.0;18.0;This is a good toaster oven for the reasons stated in many of the reviews.  It is does a fine job at broiling and baking, and the convection feature does reduce cooking time.  Unfortunately it fairly radiates heat, both through the glass door, and especially through the top of the oven, to the extent that I am concerned it will eventually warp or otherwise damage the wooden cabinets above (there is no hazard of fire).  I am not convinced you receive much in the way of energy savings in using it as against a larger but better insulated standard oven.  Some inexpensive insulation would have made all the difference.  We also miss an interior light and a back-lit LCD display.  The esthetics of the unit are fairly basic (we have the 175, brushed chrome version), including rather annoying beepers indicating temperature and timing.  Nonetheless, it is quite useful and a worthwhile appliance, and I am pleased with its performance.  Given its price (...), this is an expensive unit.  As a result, I think the average customer rating is a bit high.  Still, I don't think there is anything better on the market, and I am happy to have it.;A decent perfomer, a reasonable value
79;35.0;1.0;21.0;I bought the toaster oven and found the actual oven temp to be 50-75 degrees lower than the setting. I sent it back for repair ($15) and now the real oven temp is 70-75 lower than the setting. I use two oven thermometers, which I calibrate check in the built-in kitchen oven.;lousy temp control
68;36.0;5.0;17.0;"I've owned quite a few toaster ovens over the years but this one is so superior - - it completely blows all of the others right out of the water.  I don't know why I was so surprised at the superior quality; isn't Cuisinart the Cadillac of kitchen appliances?  I've been using mine on a daily basis now for two months.  I was pleasantly surprised that using it in convection oven mode is not noisy.  I have an open floor plan and kitchen is in close proximity to my work area so that could have been something that bothered me....but it doesn't.  My most favorite feature is the timer and the way it functions.  I work at home on my PC and it's easy to lose track of time.  Now I can put something in the oven and forget about it knowing the timer will remind me when it's done.  The small lip on the rack that prevents one from easily sliding a piece of toast off of it is only slightly annoying and easily overlooked in light of all the other wonderful featues.  The first two days I used it, I did find it necessary to refer to the user manual.  But it's basically a piece of cake to operate.  If you read all of my reviews, you might get the impression that I am easily pleased when in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.  When I spend time researching an item before I buy it and pay a decent amount of money, I do expect it to live up to the manufacturers' claims.  My Cuisinart convection toaster oven does just that.";Surpassed my expectations
97;37.0;1.0;22.0;I recently ordered, received and returned the Cuisinart TOB-165 toaster oven for one reason only.  It has no automatic shut off.  That makes it, and almost every other toaster oven on the market, an extreme safety hazard.  No automatic shut off makes this oven and the others, accidents waiting to happen.  Millions of easily distracted latchkey children and millions of forgetful senior citizens are at risk.  If you must have a toaster oven, please buy one with an automatic shut off-timer.  Black & Decker is the only brand I know of that features an automatic shutoff on some of their models. Automatic shutoffs should be made a standard by law.;At any price it's too much money for so little safety.......

2;39.0;5.0;21.0;I absoluetly love this toaster over. I use it just about everyday and could almost do away with my coventional oven!\nThe bagel setting works perfect! I love having a timer on the toaster oven, which I have never had before. It broils steaks deliciously with no splattering and my husband has broild salmon in it and loves it! Really convenient to be able to take out the crumb tray to clean the crumbs away.... It even has a convection setting!;The BEST Toaster Oven in the Whole Wide World!
7;40.0;5.0;10.0;"Produces intense heat quickly, I'm not sure what these heating elements are made of but they get hotter much faster than the $50 oven I had before this one.\n\nMaintains perfect temperature, the heating elements don't cycle on and off at full blast like cheaper ovens, but vary their output depending on the proximity to the target temperature. So instead of overshooting the set temperature by 10-15 degrees and then waiting to overshoot it again when it gets 10-15 degrees below, it inputs just enough heat to maintain the correct temperature, so repeated ""blasting"" is avoided. When your cooking a large item this is a very good thing. When on a cheap toaster oven the temp drops 20-30 degrees, and is repeatedly ""blasted"" back up, that makes it too easy to burn the top of something. Some reviewers have said they are happy to use this more than their full sized oven, and the temperature control system in the Cuisinart has a lot to do with it. A regular oven has a large thermal mass to tamp down on big temperature fluctuations; the metal walls are big enough to store up lots of heat and keep the temp consistent. This oven does electronically what big ovens due with sheer mass, by gradually parceling out heat as necessary so the temp stays consistent, and that is why it does a comparable job.\n\nThe convection feature heats up fried foods incredibly well, evenly heating to make soggy breading crispy again, without burning part of it before other parts get done. I already described above how this oven's ""brain"" allows it to keep temp consistent for such a small oven - the convection fan helps in another way, it distributes heat all around the food to minimize local hotspots, so the sides facing away from the heating elements get more even heat, delivered by circulating air. The air carries heat directed at the top and bottom, redistributing it around the oven for more even heating. Also, steam doesn't rise to the top but instead gets blown around and quickly evaporated. This is great for roasting nuts like almonds that are normally very easy to burn. The heat is so even with the convection feature that I can use it to ""oven fry"" breaded chicken brushed with olive oil and get a nicely browned, flavorful crust all around. Convection also takes about 30% less time to cook.\n\nThe toaster part of this oven also works very well. If the oven is already hot, that is factored into the toasting time and fewer minutes are seen on the countdown timer for a particular level. At first I thought this was a gimmick, but it can reduce toasting time by more than half if the oven is fairly hot, and actually works pretty consistently. I find I can even toast frozen items and they come out crispy, and will heat nicely through from the residual heat of the toasting if I leave them in there for 5 or 10 minutes afterward. Cuisinart's engineers must have spent a lot of time testing this thing.\n\nThere is a tray below the bottom heating elements that can be pulled from the rear, and it is the perfect size to wrap a sheet of aluminum foil around, so any drips and burns are a cinch to clean up. More than a year later, the tray looks perfectly clean underneath.\n\nI'd recommend this oven to just about anyone, my only complaint is the oven timer doesn't seem to shut off the oven when it runs out, it just continues to beep. I'll have to look in the manual and see if I am doing something wrong, but I don't think I am. This one negative is not much compared to the pluses of this oven though, it excels where it counts, and where most other products in this category don't dare to go.";Goes where few other toaster ovens dare to go
1;41.0;5.0;20.0;I've used this great product for the past two-three weeks now and have nothing but praise for it.  So far, I've baked several meatloafs, baked potatoes, casseroles, pizza and Texas toast...all on the convection setting.  My wife has used it several times as well and with great results.  It's done a fantastic job so far.  I mainly bought the Cuisinart for baking and it does a wonderful job especially in the convection bake mode.  The Cuisinart heats up to your temperature setting very quickly.  I really do prefer baking in my Cuisinart rather than my large oven.  It's convenient...quick...takes less time...more energy efficient...etc.  I will only use my large oven for things that do not fit in the Cuisinart.  The convenience of the touchpad buttons makes using this oven a breeze.  It looks great on our countertop as well.  It's very, very easy to use.;A wonderful, versatile convection oven.
77;42.0;5.0;17.0;I bought this unit to use as an ACTUAL OVEN as well as a toaster. This means that I have used it to make breads, cakes, bagels, cookies entrees, you name it -- as well as toast and Pop-Tarts. In all these many uses it has never disappointed. In addition, it makes extremely good toast, which is pretty rare for a toaster oven. There's a reason it costs so much: it is a really superior, high-quality product. I paid more than Amazon.com's current price (because it was a new model), and I don't regret it a bit. Far better than others I have tried. Fully recommended.;The very best.

16;44.0;5.0;11.0;We have had a Delongi Toaster Oven for 4 years and have hated it! I spent two months researching what to purchase and price was not an issue. My Wife and I wanted something that worked well. I read Consumer Reports on various brands and even read reviews here on Amazon. I read every review that went along with this model.\n\nAfter all the research, I finally purchased the Cuisinart TOB-165 in White last month. What more can I say but it works perfectly (except no light.. not a big deal). Every Toast we do works perfectly, cooking in it, the controls, all are easy to use.\n\nI am glad that we spent the money to purchase this model. We had many discounts and certificates to bring the price in half, but even so if I did not have them I would have purchased this at full price, it is worth it.\n\nMany have complained about the toast, we have yet to have any problems. As for heat, well it is an oven! Our Delongi got hot as well. It cooks fast and with easy settings/controls. We read the manual once, and once you understand the Oven, it works well. You can download the manual before you purchase it from Cuisinart's web site as we did.\n\nIf you need an Oven that works well, this one is worth it. I am glad that we purchased it.;Excellent
81;45.0;5.0;17.0;I was initially very skeptical about paying so much for a mere toaster oven.  However, the low end models I used to own were always disappointing.  This Cuisinart, however, is amazing.  Several reviews here say you can't bake with this.  Maybe I don't know how to cook, but I've found baking with the convection setting very satisfying.  Also, the interior dimensions are even larger than I expected.  I was able to fit a FiestaWare pie plate inside.  I've baked muffins and small loaves of bread, and I think they come out wonderfully.  All of the special settings for toast--defrost, bagel, 4-6 slices, also work very well.  With my old B&D, I had to hit the toast button a dozen times to toast two bagels.  With the Cuisinart, you just pick the right setting, and it comes out perfect.  If you use your toaster oven a lot, and could maybe use second, smaller real oven, this product is perfect.  If you're just making toast, it's probably overkill.;Great Product--Worth the Price

Well, that's my Cuisinart TOB-165!!  It is so roomy inside, but you'd never know it to look at it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my favorite cassarole dishes fit in it! And it's really true--4 large pieces of bread fit easily in it.  Six regular slices of Wonder Bread can fit with minimal squishing.\n\nAnd boy can this toaster cook!  It toasts beautifully and evenly.  Tonight we convection baked the perfect little pizza in it as well.  I think my husband is starting to worry at how deliriously happy I am with my new little oven.\n\nIt truly is not only a toaster, but also more real oven space for me!;One Sweet Little Oven
91;47.0;4.0;18.0;I quickly learned to ignore the rack positions recommended in the Cuisinart booklet. This oven does indeed make uneven toast - unless you adjust the rack to the lower position and turn it upside down [convex side up]. I have found the need to get creative with the rack for other baking uses also. Makes a great baked potato in 45 min., but muffins, convection baked according to a recipe in the booklet, were overbrowned in just a few minutes. Have been afraid to try other breads in such a small oven. I think some things can't handle close proximity to heating elements. A sweet little oven if you take some liberties with it.

I have had this toaster oven for about a month now and have used every feature at least once, including the baking of a pie.\n\nThis Cuisinart bakes and toasts evenly due to settings that work ACCURATELY.  I went for so long with an old unreliable Welbilt toaster oven, that it's hard to believe anything can be this easy to use, or have results this perfect.  From a door that actually makes a good seal to the easy-to-figure out touch panel, this oven has it all.\n\nSome people complain about its small size.  Why?  If you need a bigger oven, you can use the stand-up one in your kitchen!  This baby baked a 9"" pie for me with room to spare.  It toasts 2 large bagels easily, and I have also roasted chicken pieces and broiled a few small steaks.  It has many sought-after features, including convection baking.  I'm only 4'10"" tall and I've been teased for my small size, too, so I understand where the toaster oven is coming from!  :o)\n\nNo oven light is another complaint.  Get a flashlight! Ray-O-Vac sells them for about $4.99.  Please don't let that stop you from buying this wonderful kitchen appliance! I have not found its lightlessness (no, that is NOT a word) to be a problem.\n\nCan't say much about the long-term reliability (haven't had it long enough), but for the length of time that I do have it, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT and use it daily.\n\nIs it more expensive than many others? Yes, but it's worth every penny.  It looks sharp (even in the white, which is the color I chose), it's a CUISINART (I'm a KitchenAid and Cuisinart appliance snob), and it works wonderfully.\n\nIf my husband ever throws me out, the toaster oven comes with me.\n\nUPDATE:  It is now November 28, 2009.  After over 4 1/2 years, this toaster oven is still working absolutely flawlessly.  It is used on a daily basis, and I still don't have a single complaint about it. I often use it in place of my full-sized oven.  I remain completely happy with its performance and reliability.\n\n2nd UPDATE: November 8, 2012: I can't believe that this toaster oven is still going strong after 7 1/2 years!!!

I don't know why but food tastes much better when cooked in this oven!  Perhaps it's because of the ""exact temp"" feature.  And the convection feature makes the best baked potatos.  I've been using this oven for 6 months and the only fault I can find is that the crumb tray is removed from the back, so you have to be sure you have enough counter space to turn the oven around to slide the crumb tray out.";It Will Make You A Better Cook
24;50.0;5.0;11.0;After much research online and in-store, I purchased this convection toaster oven/broiler from Amazon based partially on the good customer reviews. I was replacing an old as dirt Black & Decker toaster oven.  I was suprised at how much bigger this oven is than the old one but it isn't too big for me, my husband, or my teenaged kids to carry and put on the counter to use. My family and I have been very pleased with the performance of this appliance. From simple toasting, to reheating pizza, to making side dishes, this oven does it all. I have used it to bake both in conventional and convection modes, toast, and reheat with excellent results. The digital controls are simple to use, even my kids could figure it out. It's great to use on a hot day when you don't want to heat up your kitchen and it saves energy too. I have made baked potatoes (yum), frech fries, mozzarella sticks, bagel bites, cookies, to name a few things. They all turned out great. It is a very versatile kitchen tool and looks great too!;Invaluable kitchen tool!!!
61;51.0;5.0;13.0;Well, I have to say that I personally love this toaster/oven! Listen to the negative reviews-  you can even find some positive points in their reviews- Just don't let them discourage you if you are considering this toaster oven- some of the things they whine about are absolutely silly. I researched for days, pathetically, trying to find just the right toaster oven- from basic ones, to ones with rotisseries-I just wanted the best one for the money. I wanted one that had convection, but one that would not use convection for toasting bread, as this dries the bread out even before the toasting process.. Anyway, I came accross this one and I sure am glad! I just got through making my first piece of toast, and I didn't know that a piece of bread could be toasting to golden perfection from the top crust to the bottom! My old Hamilton beach couldn't do that! I didn't even have to use the direction booklet, that is how easy it is to operate. It has a clock on it and I set it as well with no problems. I don't know what kind of toast the negative reviewers want- this machine toasts light golden brown on bottom, and to your liking on the top! It is a medium size oven- not too big and not to small. The positive reviews don't lie.  What really was my final decision on this particular oven was first the reviews, the warrenty (3 years), and the value- right now Amazon offers 25.00 off of kitchen items, so my total price was 104.99 plus free shipping (says it ends the last of April so you better act fast if you are interested) I just know that I made the right decision for myself. Oh, and by the way, my old Hamilton beach got burning hot on the outside - It is because they are constructed with metal and common sense will tell you that heated metal gets hot, duh! I didn't have to turn my toast over and over to get great results either- and no, these toasters are not malfunctioned- they just get the toast more toasted on one side depending on how you adjust your rack- believe me, there are so many options, you will get it to your personally liking!;Made a Great Decision!!!
73;52.0;5.0;14.0;Keep it clean, with the easy pull out tray, and this little oven will treat you well. We use it 2-3 times on average every day and have never had any problems. We bought it when our regular toaster went on the blink. It does not make five-star toast (that's what a toaster's for) but it toasts good enough for us. Bagels and English muffins are excellent. It also does a great job on cookies. Cook them on a sheet of non-stick foil (my favorite kitchen tool) for easy cleanup. The convection function tends to cook faster on the fan side of the oven but giving your food a turn half way through cooking takes care of that. Don't hesitate in purchasing this little gem. Just remember to thank me when you devour your first perfect bagel.;One Year and Problem Free
33;53.0;5.0;11.0;"We love this thing!  Loaded with features, digital displays, handy controls and the convection oven feature is FAST.  The glass door lets you clearly see whats going on inside - no interior light needed.  Great energy saver when you just need to heat something up but can't or don't want to use the microwave or full oven.  Makes great toast, bagels, frozen waffles, or to bake some muffins.  Very easy to clean with its removable tray. Capacity seems to be sufficient enough for its intended use - we use it numerous times every day.  Quality construction - we have had it over a year and its still runs fine.  This was a great value for the money, plus we got a spiffy free 8"" Cusinart no-stick skillet and free shipping.";A great little kitchen appliance
45;54.0;4.0;12.0;We bought this oven to replace a Delonghi retro with a timer that would turn the machine back on after the time expired. I really like the Cuisinart for making tater tots, chicken nuggets and reheating pizza. It heats up quickly and gives me a beep when it's up to temp. The convection cooking is at least 30% faster as the manufacturer claims and for the items I mentioned, it seems to be almost twice as fast. The convection fan isn't too loud on mine but it does force some hot air into the kitchen, but not enough to make me want to part with the oven.\n\nThe toast isn't perfectly even but it's closer than the Delonghi and I can flip it for the last 20 seconds if I need it just right. It could benefit from an interior light but the other features make up for this shortcoming.\n\nOverall, I am pleased with the product and would buy another if I needed it.;Recommended
84;55.0;5.0;15.0;"I ""SPLURGED"" ON THIS SINCE I AM NO MARTHA STEWART AND HAVE NO DESIRE TO BE.  HOWEVER, WHEN MY TRUSTY OLD TOASTER OVEN FINALLY BIT THE DUST, I DECIDED SINCE IT WAS THE ONE APPLIANCE THAT I ACTUALLY USED, I WOULD INVEST IN A GOOD ONE.  THE CUISINART TOASTER OVEN/CONVECTION OVEN WAS A GREAT CHOICE!  IT COOKS MY FOOD (I.E. LEFT OVER PIZZA, FROZEN TAQUITOS, CHICKEN NUGGETS, GARLIC BREAD, ETC) MUCH QUICKER THAN MY OLD TOASTER OVEN AND REMARKABLY FASTER THAN MY REGULAR OVEN.  I TYPICALLY HAVE TO CUT THE COOKING TIME ON THE PACKAGE BY ABOUT 1/3!  ANOTHER ADDED BONUS- IT DOESN'T HEAT UP MY KITCHEN!  IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR 1-2 PEOPLE, BUT LARGE ENOUGH SO THAT BOTH CAN HAVE THEIR TOAST DONE AT THE SAME TIME.  THE CONVECTION OVEN PORTION WORKS GREAT TOO, BUT I AM STILL LEARNING THAT NEW TOY.  I AM STILL NOT A CUISINART FOOD PROCESSOR MASTER (AT LEAST IT LOOKS IMPRESSIVE ON THE COUNTER WHILE IT GATHERS DUST!), BUT THE CUISINART TOASTER/CONVECTION OVEN IS GETTING A WORKOUT!";QUICK & CONVENIENT!
26;56.0;5.0;10.0;"I decided to buy a small convection oven after watching ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and deciding I needed to find ways to reduce the amount of electricity that I use. Why use the full size oven if all I want to do is bake a few mushrooms?  This little oven has almost replaced my big oven.  I can roast vegetables quickly in it, and even bake muffins.  The room doesn't get as hot as when I use the big oven, though there is some heat that escapes the front door.  It heats up super quickly and cleans easily, too.  I'm very happy with this purchase.";I love it!
15;57.0;5.0;9.0;I brought this about four months ago and love it. As a busy mom who has to cook dinner when I get in from work, it's perfect for chicken breasts or meatloaf on convection, also chicken breasts on broil.  It also toasts perfectly for a [...]picky eater. Glass window wipes clean with a damp cloth, and the outside has stayed white and not gone a yellowy colour. I've had no problems with chrome or paint quality.  Tray goes through the dishwasher and comes out perfectly clean.  It is a little larger than the standard toaster oven, but well worth the counter space.  The timer is a great reminder for me that the toast or whatever has finished cooking.  Also, the convection oven heats up in a quarter of the time the regular oven does--a boon when you are trying to get dinner in the oven quickly.  No complaints from me.;Love it!
42;58.0;5.0;11.0;This has been in our kitchen now for around 2 years. Prior to this, we had a DeLonghi which was also excellent.\n\nLike any new appliance, this one had a small learning curve to understand how to use the timer and adjust the shelf for baking/toasting various items. Since getting past that, it is a push the button and go operation.\n\nHeating has been even as far as toaster ovens go and the convection bake is a nice feature we use on occasion. One thing to be aware, when the timer goes off, don't let it sit there because the heating elements remain hot...it is still radiating heat onto what is above/below it.\n\nIf you wnat to get to know the oven, put a temp gauge in and see what settings equal what temp and where. Bake some cookies and this will also give a good idea of the hot spots. Following that, you know what to expect.\n\nAll said, we are pleased having this in our kitchen and have recco'd and bought this as gifts for friends. No complaints from them. :)\n\nUpdate 8-2017: Still going though pretty ugly now. Paint has yellowed-chipped after all the heat cycling over the years.;Excellent
18;59.0;5.0;9.0;At first, the price was a little off-putting but, having read the reviews, I figured that I had never gone wrong with something from Amazon before...so...I went for it. And am I glad I did! This amazing little oven did a Turkey breast for one for Thanksgiving and has done cassaroles and broiled steaks and brownies and just anything I've asked of it and done them perfectly. When you live alone, why heat up an entire oven to make one small cassarole? Especially when you live in the sub-tropics. I can't say enough good about this oven. It is worth every penny of the price and I'm so glad I bought it.;Amazing Appliance
69;60.0;5.0;12.0;I LOVE my Cuisinart toaster/convection oven/broiler! I've used all of the functions regularly since I bought the oven early last year. The convection oven function alone gets used at least 2-3 times per week - everything works PERFECTLY! It's the first toaster oven I've ever had that toasts beautifully, heats evenly, broils & has the convection oven feature. The timer also comes in very handy! I cannot say enough positive things about this machine!;Awesome & Versatile Piece of Equipment!
20;61.0;5.0;9.0;"UPDATE:\nOne (of the 2) bottom elements in this oven died after 12 years. We discovered it could not be repaired. However, the oven is still being used at my office right now for snack/lunch - 14 years after purchase!\n\nAfter much research and debate, I decided to replace it at home with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Decker-CTO6301-Digital-Advantage-Stainless-Steel-6-Slice-Convection-Toaster-Oven/dp/B000PSW8TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black & Decker CTO6301 Digital Advantage Stainless-Steel 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven</a>&nbsp;because it held a 9x13 inch pan for about the same footprint and was 1/2 the price of the Cuisinart.\n\nWe have used the Black & Decker for about 2 years now. I enjoy having the larger toaster oven, especially during our hot summer months, but the Cuisinart had some great features that I miss - such as a timer that could be used alone or with the oven, a digital time display showing how much longer the toast/bagel/etc would cook, it had a frozen pastry button, it stayed on/off until you cut it on/off - whether or not you used the timer. When the Black & Decker breaks I will replace it with another Cuisinart. I have learned that some things are worth the cost.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nWe have had this oven for over 5 years now.  Our large range/oven rarely gets used in the summer months!  This oven holds a medium-sized cast iron frying pan, a 6-cup muffin pan, 10"" pie plate, etc.  We'd buy another one.  Love it!";5+ Years & Still Working Fine
86;62.0;5.0;14.0;There are not enough words in the English language to describe what a gem this toaster oven is. Not only does it make the most perfect toast, but it bakes evenly fantastic too. I love that it instantly starts to heat and things cook evenly and often taste even better than if I cooked them in my regular oven! The broiler and baking tray are sucha  generous size that now I can heat up enough for both my kids in there instead of having to drag out the huge baking trays and use my conventional oven! I highly recommend it!! Very easy to use and easy to clean. A perfect match to their equally incredible Grind N'Brew coffee maker. I'm now officially sold on all Cuisinart small appliances! Well worth the price tag![.];THE BEST Toaster Oven In The Universe![.]
59;63.0;5.0;11.0;I have used my Cuisinart toaster oven with convection for more than two months.  It does everything perfectly and takes up much less space on my countertop than the Black & Decker unit it replaced.  It is attractive and the touch pad buttons are easy to use and understand. I recommend this unit to anyone who wants to toast English muffins, bagles, reheat leftovers or speed up the cooking of bakable frozen or fresh foods.;Terrific Toaster Oven
74;64.0;4.0;12.0;This is by far the best toaster oven we ever owned. We had 2 others one i don't remember the name of, the last one was a GE, Both lasted less then 2 years, were very inconstant when cooking or making toast (things would burn or under cook with the same settings from day to day)\nThe Cuisinart TOB-165 is by far the best one we ever used. It's very consistant always good results, perfect toast & bagels every time, food cooks even and fast. it has a large interior, we cook a whole dinner for two and it cooks much faster then the big oven, and the convection cook is even faster.\nWe use this much more then the big oven and in summer we can cook without heating up the whole apartment.\nThis oven beeps when it reaches the set temp, No guessing when it's pre heated. I give it 4 1/2 stars i would have givin it 5 stars but when you set the timer it only beeps when the time is up and don't shut off other then that it's the best oven we ever used. The outside gets hot but that's an advantage I put food on top and that keeps it nice and warm while other things are cooking. it's easy to clean inside and out, the controls are sealed and washable.  I highly recommend this toaster oven.;The best toaster oven we ever owned
93;65.0;5.0;14.0;I loved my Delonghi while it lasted but when it came time to replace it I tried the Cuisinart and loved it instantly!  It is perfect for small family dinners, pies and small batches of cookies.  Does not take too much counter space and is very easy to clean.;The best!
67;66.0;5.0;11.0;I purchased this toaster oven because the full size oven where I live is 25-50 degrees too hot or cold, can't even cook a pizza in it.  So, after researching 3 to 4 other brands & models decided on the Cuisinart TOB-165.\n\nSince I have owned it, I use my full-size oven as a cookware storage closet.  The Cuisinart toasts everything perfectly and very evenly.  I have made casseroles, biscuits, broiled meats and it is fantastic.  The digital buttons are easy to use and the temperature is very consistent, no burnt sides or cold interiors.  With the convection controls, it definitely cooks much quicker than a standard oven and wastes much less electricity and heat.  Pre-heating time for 375-425 degrees is about 5-7 minutes.\n\nI'd definitely buy this again as a gift or for someone moving out on their own.;Fantastic toasting and baking results
56;67.0;5.0;10.0;Convection ovens are excellent, just sometimes, it is difficult to find one that toasts well without spending too much money.  This is an excellent buy.  The toast function works wonderfully and quickly.  Even browning, quick and it is slightly bigger than a traditional toaster oven, but not too large.;Excellent
21;68.0;5.0;8.0;First, regarding the comment about the oven only toasting bread on one side: To get both sides toasted at once just make sure the rack is in the position described in the instructions and you'll have no problem.\n\nI bought this oven about a month ago and love it so much that I also bought one for my 87-year-old mother, who likes the fact that she can bake small portions without heating up a big oven. Most toaster ovens we've had in the past claimed to bake but the results were less than perfect. We both love the convection feature, which produces succulent meats - and in less time than with conventional ovens. Try the lemon chicken recipe in the booklet that comes with the oven. It's delicious!;No need to flip the bread to toast both sides
11;69.0;5.0;7.0;We are very happy with this product. We live near Asheville, NC where you really don't need air conditioning, so many of the older homes don't have it. It's fine until you want to bake something in the summer months and then the kitchen can get pretty hot. We have baked a half chicken using one of the recipes in the little book that comes with the oven. The convection oven cooked fast and the kitchen didn't get hot. We plan our meals now around the little oven.;Keeping our kitchen cool
66;70.0;5.0;10.0;I purchased this little gem as I like new gadgets, and was curious as to what a convection oven does.\n\nBasically, using the convection mode turns on a quiet fan that causes the food to cook more quickly.  It's particularly good at getting things crisp on the outside without overcooking the innards - things like french fries and frozen breaded shrimp turn out much better in a convection oven.\n\nOverall, the oven is put together very well - easy to clean, reasonably usable controls once you get the hang of it (a little room for improvement on this).  Construction is good for something this inexpensive.\n\nOne irritating thing is that when the timer goes off in the time cook mode, the oven doesn't shut off - it stays on and keeps beeping until you hit the on/off switch.\n\nHowever, the pluses so outweigh the minuses that I have to give this 5 stars - best toaster oven we've ever owned.;Another Satisfied Customer
98;71.0;4.0;13.0;Oh it is such a shame this toaster oven is out of stock!  This oven really toasts my buns!  As you already know about me, I am not a skilled domestic goddess, but even I could operate this!  It can warm up anything evenly and quickly.  Just the other day I had some leftover pate and toast.  When Marta zaps it in the micro, it comes out all mushy.  Well, I put it in this baby, and I was in 7th heaven with my crispy snack.  After I nearly lit the kitchen on fire with my last toaster oven, I vowed never again!  But this oven has changed my mind.  Only the best is my motto, and this little oven certainly is!;Not too shabby!
29;72.0;5.0;8.0;I was a bit hesitant about buying a hundred dollar (plus) toaster oven but the reviews were great and I was sick and tired of the junk I have had in the past.\n\nThe Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler is a fantastic unit.  Everything I have used it for has come out perfect.\n\nI highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a toaster over.  It is well worth the extra money.;GREAT UNIT
13;73.0;5.0;7.0;I haven't cooked a chicken yet, but I have used most of the other capablilies of this well designed appliance.  I knew from other reviews, prior to buying it, that it wouldn't cook toast as efficiently as a real toaster.\n\nThat being said, I would buy the unit again.  It's one of those things that you'll really like.  It's well made, well designed and doesn't have useless bells and whistles you won't use.  The toaster:  it does a nice job on the top side of the slice, but the bottom side has the lines from the rack.  But here's the plus, as soon as you press the toast button the timer tells you exactly when it will be done, there's no waiting wondering when the 'machine' will give forth your prize.  It may take a bit longer than a toaster, but the consistency, timer, bell and no size contraints make it all worth the extra seconds.\n\nMy impetus for the purchase was our under utitization of the ovens we have.  Like many households, there's just two of us, we hardly ever need the capacity of our two built-in ovens.\n\nBottom line:  if you can afford it, buy it.;Very user friendly
75;74.0;4.0;10.0;Our beloved DeLonghi toaster oven cratered after 18 years of heavy use, so we replaced it with this attractive Cuisinart unit.  The Cuisinart doesn't heat up as fast, but otherwise it is much more versatile.  We particularly like the many different tray heights available (at least eight, counting all the permutations of tray height and broiler pan position).\nThe one shortcoming of the Cuisinart and almost all other new toasters is, as others have pointed out, the lack of an interior light.  We solved this problem neatly by attaching a clip-on booklight to the front door handle.  Not only is the light thus out of the line of fire, so to speak, but one can focus it on the part of the food due to brown first, and, of course, turn the light off when it isn't needed.;Just right with an added light
8;75.0;5.0;6.0;Returned Oster to get this one..  It toasts well and the convection cycle is awesome.  It heats up in minutes and lets you know by beeping when it is preheated.  I bought this so I did not have to heat up my apartment with the gas oven, I'm very happy.  It cooks quickly as well.;Great product
89;76.0;5.0;11.0;I purchased this oven last year.  It has changed my cooking habits.  Its great when you are cooking for two or three.  It is a life saver during the holiday.  I can not do with out it.;Great for the Small family
9;77.0;5.0;6.0;This oven is used for baking, toasting, and some warming. It is much quicker than the conventional oven and does a nice job. We appreciate how it uses less energy and cools down quickly. The large oven rarely gets turned on anymore.;Great oven
47;78.0;4.0;8.0;"I did a lot of searching for toasters before buying this one, and am happy with the purchase.\n\nA few nits:\n\nThe toast does not easily slide out because the metal bar around the wire toast rack is on top, not on bottom. So you have to lift up the hot toast to get it out. Ouch.\n\nThe ""done"" beep is way too loud, and does not seem to be configurable.\n\nThe controls could be simpler.";Very good, but could be a bit better.
5;79.0;5.0;5.0;Great product that does all it says and fast.  Oven large enough and racks flexible in positioning to allow ample size baking pans/glass or stoneware.  A bit tough to clean and my white model makes some stains seem baked on, but I still would replace it with same brand again though in black.  I did find it cheaper in Costco than on-line, so shop around.;Cuisinart toaster/broiler convection oven
14;80.0;5.0;6.0;I have had 5 ovens over a period of years...they either died or perfomed badly enough to dump them.....this oven is easily the absolutely best unit ever....the temperature is as advertised...exact to the degree set...the convection mode is really the only mode I use, it is very fast and does everything I do as well as our 600 buck full size kitchen stove, of course with smaller amounts....cannot go wrong with this unit.....I am so impressed that I will probably buy another one as a spare in the event this one dies and they are no longer available .... the story of my life....;Super duper oven
19;81.0;5.0;6.0;I love toast and make a lot of sandwiches of all with premium breads of all thick nesses and sizes as densities.  My wife likes heavy multigrain breads full of moisture which take forever to toast.  I like the light fluffy bread which toasts much quicker. This toaster oven consistently performs well over this variety of toasts.  We like seeds on the bread exterior to toast enough to release their flavor & this machine does that well too.  I read about 200+ reviews of the leading toasters from many sources.  This toaster received some of the best reviews including, but not often mentioned comments on toasting. I had trouble making up my mind to spend so much on a toaster-oven which would take a lot of counter space and be primarily used for toasting.\n\nI had a 20 year old Black & Decker which performed excellent, but left it in my old house.  I needed a nice looking toaster for the new upgraded house.  Since I am a toast addict I stooped to pick up a new Black & Decker toaster oven at Wal-mart (a store I hate to shop at because everything is junk).  The Black & Decker dried and hardened the toast from the inside out so that when any sign of toasting occurred the bread was now as hard as a brick and as dry as powdered cement.\n\nI purchased the Cuisinart TOB-165 from Amazon and it arrived in a bigggg box in just a few days.  It installed flawlessly & was toasting in 'extradinore' mode without reading any instructions.  Cuisinart TOB-165 gives you a lot of intuitive control over toasting and the results are impressive.  I get rave reviews for my famous sandwiches and the ability to toast the outside of the bread while leaving the inside warm and chewy gives just the right touch to a sandwich.  The Cuisinart TOB-165 is heavy, well build & controls are easy to read, easy for big fingers to adjust and thoughtfully placed.\n\nAdditionally, we have used the Cuisinart TOB-165 to heat pizza, to cook fish sticks and the assorted things a toaster/broiler oven does.  I find that heating pizza first on convection and finishing off with broiling restores the pizza to much better than delivery condition.\n\nOh,  did I mention that I purchased a Cuisinart 2 slice fat toaster for those few times when the bread was small or cooking a bagel.  It heats very quickly and just toasts the outside, nothing more.  You have to watch that one like a hawk or it will burn.  I much prefer the results from the Cuisinart TOB-165 & use it when I want the best results.;Cuisinart TOB-165, a great  & versitile toaster
35;82.0;5.0;7.0;I have bought and tossed quite a few toaster ovens over the last few years. They all shared the same problems. Difficult to use precisely, required constant watching and very uneven cooking. Since I was once again equipping my kitchen from scratch, I decided to do my research. I wanted something that I could use for anything from Bagels to reheating dinner or even cooking dinner. The Cuisinart has it all. It allows me to toast the bagels just the way I like them - just barely browned, at the same time allowing me to reheat anything from pizza to fried foods leftover from the diner. My girl was even able to bake bread in it. The oven heats quickly and maintains an even temperature. The convection option cooks faster and more evenly than traditional Toaster Ovens. Well worth every penny.;Hands Down the Best Toaster Oven I have ever owned.
37;83.0;5.0;7.0;Works great as a toaster and also for baking. Cleans easily. Use ours daily and just love it. Great size for two people.;Great oven/toaster
49;84.0;5.0;7.0;"I first purchased this model as a gift for my mother. Her oven on her stove is problematic, and, since the top works fine, and she seldom cooks, I contemplated getting her a nicer toaster oven, in lieu of a new stove. In addition, my teen-age nieces are often at their grandma's so a nice toaster oven would be easy and safer for them to use. After reading all of the reviews on this model, I went ahead and got it for her. As I suspected, she doesn't use it a ton, but dear nieces do, and I at least know I have something to use when I come home to visit.\n\nHowever, I was so impressed with the reviews, and the oven, that I decided to upgrade my little Black and Decker TOB. It just wasn't big enough to make a nice meal for myself. Being single, it is a drag to turn on the big oven, and heat the entire apartment in the process, in Hotlanta no less. I sometimes like to keep fish sticks and frozen french fries on hand for quick meals.\n\nWell, Amazon.com gave me my excuse to buy this machine. They had a special with 25$ off, no tax, no shipping, so got it cheaper than my mom's. Truth be told, I am a KitchenAid girl, but I do have a Cuisinart ice cream maker that I got as 5 year anniversary at work, it is nice, so I thought one more Cuisinart won't tarnish my KA reputation. Shipping was fast and reliable, as always from Amazon.\n\nI couldn't wait to try her out! So, since I had a craving for Mexican, I decided to cook up some burritos.\n\nRecipe:\n\n1 pound boneless and skinless chicken breasts\n\n1 small jar of your favorite salsa\n\n1 small can of green chilis\n\n1 can of green chili sauce\n\n8-12 oz your favorite Mexican cheese mixture\n\n10-12"" flour tortillas\n\nSour cream\n\nlettuce\n\nSeason the chicken with salt/pepper/chipotle pepper\n\nPoach the chicken in a large skillet in 1-2 cups of salsa on medium-low for about 25 minutes. (If you get the cut up tenderloins you can reduce it to 20 minutes.)\n\nRemove the cooked chicken from pan, but don't throw away the remaining salsa. Wait until chicken is cool enough to handle and shred with a fork, or your fingers. Mix it back in with the salsa, add the green chilis, and more salsa until it is thoroughly mixed and moist.\n\nPut about 1/4 cup of mixture in middle of tortilla and sprinkle with one palm full of cheese. Fold tortilla.\n\nYou should be able to get about 6 burritos, but you can just make up one for now, or two, since we are using our TOB!\n\nLay the burritos on the broiler pan (lined with teflon Reynolds Wrap for ease of cleaning) with the open side down. Spoon several tablespoons of chili sauce over, then another large palm full of cheese.\n\nNow, back to the oven, this was my first time, with no real recipe, so I did it a bit hot. Set your oven to 350 convection. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown and cheese melted. Top with sour cream and lettuce.\n\nYUMMY!\n\nThe TOB cooked the burritos beautifully, the outside didn't get too hot to touch, the oven did not emit a lot of heat, and it cooled down fast. I set the rack on A and it was perfect.\n\nPros:\n\n- The user-interface is very intuitive. I didn't even need to get the manual out to figure things out.\n\n- Love that it beeps to let you know it is preheated.\n\n- The outside didn't get overly warm, that I noticed, or emit a lot of heat.\n\n- Much easier to use than oven, and no bending down, burning yourself on oven racks getting stuff out of the oven. (Great if you have a bad back.)\n\nCons:\n\n- Price - Let's not kid ourselves, it is a bit pricey.\n\n- Crumb tray loads from the back. This was poor design. Why have to move the entire thing around to take out and clean it? I did order a silicone type liner from Amazon so hope that will help get it clean.\n\nSo, so far, I am thrilled with the TOB. It does take up a bit more real estate on the counter, plus keeping it 2"" away from the wall. But, being single, I really appreciate the thought that went into making this small oven to make small meals.\n\nNow I just can't wait to find more pans to fit it!";Great TOB for Singles or small kitchens!

36;88.0;5.0;6.0;This is the only toaster oven I've gotten that has a door that shuts tight. I read the reviews and decided to go for it.  More money than I wanted to spend, but I have had 3 different toaster ovens in as many years.  This oven is a dream for toasting, and roasts very well.  The biggest drawback is there is no interior light;Best ever for toast and small roasting
40;89.0;5.0;6.0;It is easy to clean & use. It evenly cooks food and heats up in no time! I love using for toddler size meals & leftover pizza.;I love it!
43;90.0;5.0;6.0;I purchased the Cuisinart ConvectionToaster Oven/Broilerlast summer and have used it constantly since then.  I only rarely use my stove oven anymore because this little gem does  everything the large oven does, plus toasts evenly, bakes perfectly, broils beautifully, and leaves the kitchen cool.  I'd recommend it highly to anyone.;It's a great toaster-oven
50;91.0;4.0;6.0;I am in the middle of a major kitchen renovation that will take 3 months to complete. We bought this toaster oven to hold us over. It has done that and more. We are very pleased with the speed at which it cooks. It does a perfect job on everything from toast to roast! We've broiled hamburgers, baked biscuits, frozen pizza, french fries, pigs-in-a-blanket, breaded chicken breast, and more. Everything turns out as good or better than when we use our regular oven. The cooking times are drastically reduced when you use the convection option. You can easily watch your food cook through the large, clear glass window. The design is clean and compact. There is only room for improvement in the user interface. Using the front panel to navigate between settings and features is awkward, and not intuitive. You should not have to read directions to operate a toaster oven, but with this model, it is almost necessary.;Excellent Oven - Cooks Great!
52;92.0;5.0;6.0;"I did quite a bit of shopping around before choosing this model, and now I'll never be without a toaster oven again.  I grew up with a microwave, and didn't ""get"" why these were so convienent!!!  I've lived with this model for over a year, and probably use it 5-6 times a week.  It saves me time (convection rocks) and keeps my kitchen cool.";My first toaster oven, now I'm hooked
23;93.0;4.0;5.0;My kitchen is on the west side of my house, in TEXAS!  It is difficult to keep it cool in the summer and turns into a suana if you fire up the oven. I bought my Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven as an alternative. It has been just great. Does not heat up the kitchen at all. I would have given it 5 stars, but mine does not brown as evenly as I would like. I have to stop and turn the item halfway through. Outside of that, it's terrific.;Fits my needs & works terrific.
80;94.0;5.0;7.0;This is the best appliance. It makes great toast and the convection oven works wonderfully.\nThe only thing I don't like is the way the rack sits in the oven -- there is only one position in which it is locked so it won't slide the whole way out without your wanting it to.\nI have never tried to cook a chicken in it but I have made loads of toast, fish, potatoes, etc. and it just works superbly.\nI was very impressed by how well this oven works and would buy it again.;I love mine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
85;95.0;4.0;7.0;"Works great.  I would have given it 5 stars except I wish it were just a little bigger inside; a little higher.  And I wish it would shut off when the timer reaches the end.  I hate watching stuff to see when it's done.\nMakes excellent toast, cooks steak juicy with good control of heat, and cooks a cornish hen just perfect; juicy and tender.\nOverall, an excellent buy from Amazon, with excellent delivery.";Almost perfect
46;96.0;5.0;5.0;We were looking for a toaster oven that could toast the SECOND set of toast just as good as the first - without burning or under-toasting the bread.  This is the one.  Perfect toast every time!  It also performs it's other tasks, baking and broiling in an exceptional manner.  It may be a little more expensive than other toaster ovens, but it is well worth the difference in price.;Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler
53;97.0;5.0;5.0;Prior to purchasing ANY toaster/oven, I reviewed all the comments on the various brands on AMAZON.  Based on the great reviews for this toaster/oven, I purchased it and just LUV IT!  It bakes & toasts wonderfully!!  I use it several times during the day.  One of the reviewers mentioned using a bottle opener to pull & push the tray in & out and it works great.  I hate I waited so long to consider buying one.  Now I don't have to heat up the whole kitchen to make my hubby his favorite sourdough biscuits.;LUV IT!
55;98.0;5.0;5.0;I have finally found a toaster that will toast both sides and it is not only a toaster, but I love the convection oven.  I don't have to start my stove oven up to bake potatoes, etc.  It does so many things that it is worth the price.  I have been through a lot of toaster ovens and this is the best.;"""Wonderful""Toaster & Conv. oven."
64;99.0;5.0;5.0;"Like many others here, I owned  Black and Decker toaster ovens which worked to varying degrees of ""OK"" to fire prone- a kitchen necessity that I had  to replace every couple years.\nAfter debating about spending the extra money I decided to go for the Cuisinart, having read the great reviews here.  I am very happy that I did.\nIt feels kind of like having a Mercedes after owning a Geo.  The oven works great for toast and  bakes well.  The digital panel was easy enough to figure out even without reading the instructions.\nConsidering that I use it just about every day, I can say it was money well spent  and toasting is a pleasure.  I  hope it has a long life too!\n\nUpdate August 2009:  I'm still getting good use from this toaster oven  Often I forego using my big oven, and use this instead to roast  a chicken.  I often use the convection oven feature, which leaves things more moist.\nMaking toast does take longer in this  than using a conventional toaster.\nReally money well spent.";as good as I hoped
96;100.0;5.0;6.0;Incredibly sophisticated!  Much larger interior capacity than anticipated.  Incredible price!  Lovely to look at, too!  Taped instruction booklet to cabinet above appliance until I get the hang of it--practice-will-make-perfect!  ...;AWESOME!  BLOODY AWESOME!!

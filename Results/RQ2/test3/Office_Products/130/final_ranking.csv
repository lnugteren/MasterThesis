0;104;88;0.869163981737028;update i installed the phone link updater from palm s web site and can use my nokia 6102 s wap net connection to surf the net keep in mind how much data you have real net access will eat up say 5mb really quickly so keep track of this unless you want huge phone bills or just get unlimited net access n ni also bought a 1gb sd card kingston it was 30 15 on amazon great deal it works perfectly n ngreat pda i bought mine mostly to keep track of homework since my old pdas 2 visors and a sony clie were dead or dying after months of deliberation between the e2 and the z22 i picked the e2 i figured that it would hopefully last a while so i d get the better of the two n ni love it the screen is beautiful when i look back at my clie sl10 i wonder how i was able to stand using it as my regular pda anyway yeah great screen it comes with a photo viewer which works well a tad slow flipping through photos on the memory card but that might just be my memory card it is n t a particularly fancy one i think it was the cheapest one they had n nthe speaker is amazing it s better than the ones on my ibook it actually has midrange and a bit of bass there s a headphone jack so you can use headphones and everything but it s actually feasible to fill a small room with the sound from an e2 i use realplayer for music most of the time it can multitask occasionally when another app accesses the card the music skips or cuts out for a second but they s expected frankly i m amazed that it can multitask when i want louder music i use tcpmp the core pocket media player it s a 3rd party free open source media player that also plays videos yup the e2 can do video i have n t tried realplayer for video yet and yes you can play two mp3s at once realplayer in the background tcpmp in the foreground nas for other stuff it comes with documents to go 7 with native document support which means that you do n t need to convert documents just stick them on the memory card i have n t actually used this yet so no word on how it keeps formatting but if it s anything like it does normally it s probably better than pocket word on a pocket pc nit has bluetooth i have n t tried it as i have nothing else to try it with but it does work paired it with someone s motorola razr to test it non the topic of connecting to phones i have n t managed to get net access via ir via my nokia 6102 cingular but it can use the dialer app to dial my phone so i can dial any number in my palm s address book excuse me contacts goes off and mutters about how palm changed all the app names to fit outlook oh yeah i can beam photos from my phone it s a camera phone to my palm and then put them on my computer ni m on os x palm desktop works well it s still basically claris organizer there s a send to handheld droplet that converts photos videos etc to send to the palm oddly enough it seems to be able to install stuff in the middle of a hotsync last time i checked it would n t let you queue up anything to install during a hotsync not with this it ll go and install it really cool nanyway great pda if you re really into music i d recommend getting a 512mb or 1gb sd card it does n t come with one i m using the 64mb one i bought for my hp49g calculator not nearly enough space for music nit comes with a universal screen protector which after cutting to the correct size marked on the plastic backing will be very useful for people like me who are worried about scratching their brand new pda none thing to take into consideration is the warranty it s only 90 days 50 at palm s online store will get you a 1 year warranty that includes one screen replacement if you register the e2 before you buy it they give you or at least they gave me a 20 off coupon making it 40 just keep this in mind noverall excellent pda have n t had any problems it does everything i need and probably 20 billion things i have no use for it s cool
1;40;66;0.8646764502325457;last year i purchased an e2 to replace my tungsten e which had become increasingly difficult to turn on and impossible to turn off the power switch died within months of purchasing it and i had to use the function buttons e g the address book date book buttons to get it to come on when even those became iffy i purchased the e2 however i bought the extended warranty for that unit because of the power button issues n nsure enough the power button failed within 2 months i have n t had a chance to return it for service yet because the warranty even the extended third party warranty requires that i ship it off somewhere potentially being without it for up to two weeks this is unacceptable from a service standpoint if you have a pda chances are you rely pretty heavily on it and can not be without it that long if you do purchase such a thing find out if the retailer has any sort of local replacement service n nit has the same very annoying screen hum the tungsten e had i mostly just tune that out n nit locks up and must be reset fairly often when i try to use adobe reader it also locks up at other random times all seem to be when i use third party software i ve got a game card popcap that ran fine on the tungsten e but on the e2 about half the games come up saying need x amount of memory you only have xxx amount free since the available amount is considerably more than the needed amount the games should run must be an os conflict n nthe screen display is great indoors but very very hard to read outdoors in the sun i think that s a problem with pretty much any pda though n non the plus side nice looks screen display is decent lots of applications available battery life usually serves nicely for a full day of out and about i tend to pop the thing out whenever i m waiting anywhere to play games or read ebooks so it gets used heavily n nthe included sync cable is an improvement over the tungsten e in that it s got a button to sync you can plug in your powered off unit and hit the button on the cable rather than having to power up the unit to do it from the screen or having to reserve one of the function buttons for the purpose n ni d consider going with a pocket pc device next time around except my spouse uses a palm also and we want to stay on the same platform n none really major major major omission on the part of the palm os they really need to include tools to help multi pda households share databases the whole family uses the date and address capability and it s a pain to manually keep them up to date we ve tried two third party alternatives groupsync which ran in the background with every sync but was very very wonky duplicated entries constantly and did n t work when we moved to a tungsten platform and syncus which requires us to manually bring up the application which compares differences in the two users and suggests things we should copy from one to the other and makes that easy by providing appropriate onscreen buttons although that requires manual intervention it works flawlessly
2;81;78;0.8579934614324316;i have had absolutely not a single complaint about the e2 thus far and i have been using it for a little over four months now n ni purchased this machine to upgrade from a sony clie nx70v that i found very useful for many years but which had features i just did not find myself needing to use like a voice recorder digital camera and even a moving images recorder all stored on inserted sony stick memory but it was the battery life that was the most frustrating thing about it see below for more n nwhen i was looking for a palm to purchase however my main concern was battery life i only use the thing to look at documents contacts ebooks etc very little text input per se that is done on my laptop or in a pinch from a wireless keyboard a friend gave to me for christmas made by palm which also works quite nicely i do not use it for looking at photos or for wireless networking or bluetooth or email or the internet from a palm it is merely an information organizer n nso i came across the e2 for under 130 in a circuitcity and bought it the thing gets over 16 hours of battery life with the things i use it for i have had no problems with installation or indeed with anything about the machine since then i have not had to soft boot it once and i use it daily n nthe sd slot holds a 512mb card that easily holds the ebooks i normally access over 35 volumes of reference material and many novels non fiction and daily documents sd cards are cheap so this was nice for me n nbut there was one additional thing i was very happy to discover and that is that it plays mp3 files very nicely i have had no problems with the realplayer software whatsoever all i do is copy the mp3 files from my collection on my laptop to an sd card put the sd card in and voila a 512mb or bigger i d imagine though i have not purchased any larger sd cards portable mp3 player i was very pleased with the sound quality too and it goes on like this for over 12 hours comparable to recent ipods and other mp3 players battery life wise n ni am also thrilled with the flash memory feature there do some times when one is just away from an outlet for a long period of time and then thing runs out of juice although i have not had that happen with the e2 yet it did happen with my old clie and that was a royal pain in the neck there were of course tools that came with the machine to recover from this and with some ease admittedly but i still thought a pain in the neck n nso i would recommend this to anyone who does simple tasks as i do but who needs long battery life at an affordable price if you want to do anything else look elsewhere
3;24;129;0.8472454018724019;overall i find the e2 a joy to use the screen is beautiful the processor is fast and the casing looks expensive furthermore the bluetooth hotsync works effectively so i never need to use the cable again i have a light weight computer apple powerbook g4 12 so i do not think it is necessary to have a pda loaded with functions which are often too complex to use and too expensive to buy the e2 like the original idea of the palm pilot is designed to replace the address book memo pads that we must carry plus a few new tricks in a light and relatively inexpensive package the downside of this is the lack of a good carring case with a belt clip the e2 does come with a piece of rubber to cover its screen but this does not offer protection if you need to carry it with you all the time which is something that a pda supposed to do i have this for about one month and so far there is no quality control issue as yet i do find the screen a little numb and not as sensitive as my old palm iii but i can live with that in summary i still highly recommend it
4;73;45;0.8348904023953307;october 2006 my tungsten e which was very satisfactory was showing signs of battery failure so i opted for the e2 i m sorry i did not buy the tx which has a faster processor the e2 has non volitile memory and a different file system it is so slow that it may take 4 seconds to turn on or to change programs i often get an out of memory message palmone did give me good tech support on this i have to do a warm reset the good news here is that the stylus that comes with the unit will work to do the reset on the back n ntoday the e2 failed to do a hot sync or to turn on i finally tried the reset and that solved the problem the palmone site shows that getting close to the 500 number of files limit will create problems fortunately i have less than 200 files n nother than speed between programs and the need to reset about once a week the e2 is doing everything my e did and just as well if you have n t tried the palm sudoku from astraware you re missing a most efficient way to play the game electronically n nupdate 03 01 07 i got tired of how slow the e2 is to respond to simple tasks like turning off and on changing programs and syncing so i bought a palm tx this led to difficulties in getting tx software to work on my windows xp systems i conquered the problems which you can read about in my review on the palm tx i m giving my e2 to a 6th grader who likes sudoku i wish i had bought the tx in the first place
5;41;81;0.8172863099450265;i ve had palms as long as i can remember and now the tungsten e2 at last has bluetooth a beautiful screen good battery life and lots of flash memory all the usual facilities are fast and reliable contacts diary memos to do lists and the bluetooth works a treat i use a motorola razr v3 and versamail built in and all i do is bring up versamail tap get mail and wait while it contacts the telephone on my belt retrieves all the mail and signs off again and i have tomtom navigation which is superb n nhowever i have had some problems n n1 the case is not as strong as the old palms and has to be treated with care n n2 the first two i had were faulty on one the touch screen broke down on day 2 n n3 the new palm os seems to be much less resilient than previous versions much of the old software i downloaded for previous palms causes a fatal exception do n t expect to run all the old games or email programs aol mail runs but tends to upset other programs including tomtom n n4 the connections are inevitably different from the previous versions so you ll probably need a new modem and a new keyboard n nhaving said that i m really fond of it now i m learning how to treat it
6;76;19;0.7850030125869091;i like the palm handhelds in general and have relied on them for years and this one promised a nice combination of features at a relatively low price n nunfortunately the device seems to have been rushed to market too quickly i spend way too much time fighting two awful aspects of the e2 in particular the biggest pain is that the synch cable is the most poorly designed interface i have ever used on any device it is almost impossible to keep it plugged in while it is synching that alone makes the device useless to me on many days n nthe other pain is that the new memory feature while it is a wonderful idea is not quite ready for prime time many otherwise reliable applications crash with the new memory subsystem it is n t fatal since the device does successfully keep its memory after the crash but it is disconcerting and a frequent waste of time n none odd thing i ve taken this unit back several times because of a high pitched whine that it makes whenever it is turned on every unit i have gotten has this problem for some reason i eventually just figured i had to live with it even the demo models in the store make the sound so i figured it was just a universal or nearly universal problem with the e2 design
7;110;14;0.7758498434179336;i just received my palm a few days ago ok actually last night just thought that i d pop in here the place that i ordered it from i ordered it new from amazon i recommend it and give a short and concise review nfirst of all know that i really do like this palm once you get past the installing process and get comfortable with it to any newbies out there there s a few things that i recommend you doing before you get your palm n 1 order an expansion card with it or go to the store and get one you re going to need it if you ll be working with any extra applications like documents to go music etc n 2 get a wireless keyboard if you are going to be typing anything out on your palm like i do i ordered it so that i could work i type long stories and need a real keyboard n 3 get a cover to go with either a leather case or hard case just go with how much you re going to be handling your pda and how much money you ve got to spend the palm does come with a case but of course as usual its a cheapie so i would say that you should order a new one n 4 enjoy it do n t let yourself get stressed out when you get the palm it will probably not live up to your standards for easy to set up and install sync etc but do n t worry if you re at all techie then you ll get used to it and work out all the kinks if you re having problems with something tell someone do n t just suffer through it leave me a comment or go to the palm website there is a special website that you will be able to find in your installation cd or on the box that is especially for your tungsten e2 n nso go live life and take the other bits of life with you in your palm
8;30;52;0.7737467040242677;with none of the plasticky goodness of the z 22 or the mobile chernobyl power of the lifedrive the e2 is an excellent mid range buy i was looking for my first pda to keep me organized as i re entered the job market and eventually got the e2 from the moment it came out of the box my e2 has kept me happy the bright crisp screen easy to use controls good looks and practical software bundle information is password protected and the layout is easy to follow many moan and groan over graffiti 2 which turns movements of the stylus into typed script but i just use the on screen keyboard and do just fine the battery keeps going for several days even with constant use some things to remember n nit is not an mp3 player n nit is a great wasy to store a lot of info on the go combining datebook calendar and phone index into a sharp looking package n ncomes with hotsync cable and recharger but the cradle is worth buying as it will stand the e2 up while charging so you can keep working n ngo ahead and spring for a pda holder of some kind as the stainless steel casing shows wear easily and the screen is far to sensitive for a pocket or purse i have the krusell handit leather case w cilp myself n nthis pda is good for personal light business work and strongly recommend it for a first time buyer
9;98;39;0.7525329067228604;i bought the tungsten e2 to replace my franklin day planner of 13 years and so far so good i am still finding out new features and ways to use it but have been quite satisfied some other reviews had me apprehensive suggesting charging problems etc but a relative s recommendation prompted me to go ahead i have found the battery life to be better than expected having used it for three weeks i have had to charge it weekly with fairly heavy usage over that time from my experience as a new palm user it has been easy to adapt to and use one of these days i will get around to using the software that came with it in order to get deeper into the available features and uses i m glad i made the purchase
10;38;112;0.7477229514246693;two months ago i replaced my well loved t e with the e2 primarily for the bluetooth this has exceeded my expectations and bluetooth become an essential tool for e mail collection on the t e i never succeeded in collecting mail via my gprs enabled phone using infrared with the e2 it astonishingly easy to set up it helps having an old ubiquitous phone i think n nthis newer model e2 still provides the right funtionality right battery life right weight at the right price just some poorly thought out improvements over the previous model n n1 the t e2 is slower than my t e this is really distracting when writing graffiti which i do quite quickly the t e never lagged behind but the e2 does i conclude that this arises from the use of flash memory go back to the other type please n n2 the standard mini usb port on the e2 has been replaced by a proprietory port i liked the usb port i could use my identical canon camera cable for the t e this allowed the other one to stay at work now i carry the cable round with me n n3 the t e2 charger socket why has this changed my old charger does not work with the new unit n n4 the 5 way button navigation has changed in palmos 5 4 perhaps to be more windows like a mistake on the te i could navigate through notepad entries with the left and right edge now these simply move focus between on screen buttons so i have to navigate to the left or right on screen button and press the centre key to activate the button tiresome
11;86;17;0.7396668432490235;i am a very busy facility manager and i need the palm operating system os i believe the palm os is superior to any other pda os and i do not have the time to learn something else this product is exactly what i need badly but it is just too expensive to only last from 6 to 18 months i am painfully aware of this because my fifth 5th one of these always purchased new just quit n ni do not abuse these units i keep them from moisture shock and vibration all i do is use them gently a lot most of the failures have been related to the beeper which i rely on as a meeting or deadline reminder other failures have been battery related the latest failure is the centering procedure for the stylus operation being off too high on the display no matter what i do making the alpha numeric touch screen function impossible to access n nif this product cost less than 50 00 knowing it will only last for months not years i may again consider it i guess i am saying it is cheap junk only worth 50 00 at retail n ni seriously considered some of the sharp and casio models but i need a program like documents to go so i can upload my large database of excel notes which i can search while away from my office i wound up purchasing a like new handspring visor prism for just over 100 00 n nif anyone knows of a reliable color pda that runs the latest palm os and is not expensive please post or comment to this message this information would not only help myself but many others n nby the way i would not recommend wasting your good money on this unit
12;124;40;0.7158811064738221;i use this handheld for nursing school and i ve been able to purchase reference books online use ereader and have all i need for clinicals at my fingertips the handheld is a nice pocket size for carrying but the included case is nothing but a screen cover so i ve had to purchase a case i use an extra 1 gig memory card for all my programs inexpensive way to carry a lot of information i give this a 4 star rating due to the hotsync connection it s a little loose so i ca n t move the unit while syncing or i lose the connection i ve also had to order a cradle for this use which would have been a nice addition to the unit as purchased overall i like this unit but have had to make several other purchases to suit my needs
13;2;7;0.65879360406292;certainly this device is outdated technology compared with what is currently available in smartphones note not from palm they are out of business this product s technology is about 10 years old and dates back to about 2004 n ni have used palm devices from the very first one and it was a product that changed my life i forgot nothing i had the information i needed at my fingertips i was and somewhat still am very comfortable using the palm tungsten note if you are thinking of purchasing one be forewarned it will not work to well with windows 7 or 8 you need to go to the internet and find from user support groups the appropriate software fixes and drivers that will enable it to work with windows it took me the better part of entire day to research the information and get all the ducks in a row so to speak to get it to work flawlessly hence the 4 stars as as opposed to 5 n nfinally why did i buy this when today s smartphones will run rings around this handheld pda i had a smartphone and decided it was a huge pain to operate the touchscreen was always giving me the wrong item not the screen s fault but my big fingers also i really did not want all the information contained within all tied up in a single device i now have a flip phone and my palm tungsten pda
14;71;8;0.6451074831324508;i have had palm devices since they first came out i currently have a desktop pc 2 laptops and 2 ipads i have tried to get away from the tungsten 2e for for years but nothing does what they do nearly a well as they do it they are clearly the best appointment calendar contact list around you will never be late for an appointment again no ipad app on my 600 dollar ipad will quickly setup a repeating appointment in a complex manner like the the 2nd sunday every other month no app will start to notify me with a beep 1 day 1 week 1 hour or minute before the appointment or task and continue to beep me every 5 or ten minutes until i acknowledge it and either silence it with one touch or put it on snooze to remind me again n nsuch a system is only good if you keep it with you so you have it as soon as you commit to a new task and enter it immediately the tungsten can always be in a shirt pocket or purse my ipad can not be if you forget it when you finally retrieve it there it is beeping every 5 minutes for your appointment no ipad app will do that n nit has a great to do list with priority rankings great software so you can enter everything with a keyboard and sync it to your tungsten if you ever run over it with a car get another re sync it and never miss a beat this brings me to durability i have dropped then hundreds of times and always cringe but never did more than scuff them up i have dropped one into a storm drain grate washed them in a front loader with laundry dropped one in my lilly pond and salvaged them all after drying them out one i warped with too much heat because i got impatient and forgot to go back and check on it while drying it out i was still able to hot sync it and buy another n nthey have great battery life if i was going out of town for less than a week i never took my charger i could go on and on but i will jump to the limited short comings n nthe cons they are older technology so less ebooks and less sharing of data no surfing the internet no email etc they have one notorious flaw where the touch screen can get so out of whack that you can not calibrate it this does not happen often when it does just let it run down by running some function non stop then recharge it

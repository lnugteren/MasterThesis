0;17;47;0.7261182285847286;the globe looks great but the stand does n t weigh enough you have to hold the stand down to turn the globe otherwise the globe pushes away as you spin it and the spinning is stiff it s sitting on my desk and i can only allow students to use it with supervision upon request until i figure out a way to put weight on the bottom which adds to the price of the globe i wish i had known this before purchasing and before i threw away the box eek
1;22;9;0.7123996771834623;there is quite a lot of appropriate detail on the globe considering the scale but the detail is not over done which can lead to confusion on some maps and globes as too much information which is really a distraction national boundaries are clear and distinct easy to locate latitude and longitude the features i was seeking are distinct and well labeled the lines match up the ocean floor mountain ranges and other land forms are included and are quite interesting the globe is mounted on a durable metal stand frame if one wants a globe with up to date national boundaries replogle offers discount on a new globe personally i do not find it necessary that a globe contain the latest name or boundary like any map a globe is a document of changing history ni was particularly impressed with the quality and forethought of the internal packaging in the shipping box the globe is securely held in place to prevent movement and damage the internal packaging will also protect the globe from a good measure of rough handling in shipment with this much concern to insure the globe arrives in good condition i am further impressed with the over all dedication of replogle in producing a quality product ni am very well pleased with the features of the globe and the high quality of construction it is a convenient size for a desk and of course it is easily moved about
2;28;46;0.701288103829348;the relief on this globe was off by a good inch when measuring at the equator meaning mountain ranges were in the wrong places the stand was pretty wobbly and it was nearly impossible spin the globe quickly because it was so light and the stand kind of flimsy if you need a quick globe and do n t care about quality this one would work but if you want one to keep for years and to be accurate then buy something more expensive and of a different brand
3;49;23;0.6424450473463242;this is a for the price review good amount of detail for this price point and same globe as used in higher priced models it is the cheapest 12 model with a metal stand that i could find as pointed out by some others the assembly quality is indifferent not all the lines line up but it is not as bad as some pictures others have posted here and the content is still legible enough
4;16;20;0.6379645360033454;the look of this globe is out of this world it is bright colorful and is profiled to reveal mountain ranges there are many other useful features like shipping routes it is large enough for a clear view of even some of the tiniest island groupings the company also gives you the option of updating your globe at lower cost if their are major political changes on the world map it looks great in my den office
5;34;16;0.5772710879139068;came well packaged and quality is pretty good i would n t recommend placing it where it could be pulled off a table or anything since it would likely break but my young kids love looking at it and putting in perspective where different places are i also like explaining day and night to them by turning off all lights in the room except one which represents the sun and then we spin the globe slowly to show day and night
6;47;45;0.5643040221049153;very sturdy globe and easy to read names it s a relief globe and you can really feel the mountains it s for a grandchild and i know she ll learn much from it
7;37;37;0.5296051473482271;it is a decent globe but does not meet my expectation i guess i was expecting too much the raised relief is not that great
8;18;17;0.4986058740049639;l read some of the reviews before buying this globe and i was skeptical about it especially because i read the northern hemisphere was n t aligned with the southern hemisphere but when i got it everything was aligned there was only 1 or 2 longitude s line that was misaligned but you really have to look for it it was about a quarter of a centimeter off not a big deal some people i guess had bad luck
9;8;8;0.4195009739269332;this is a pretty good globe to be fair it is a good gift for a child that has an interest in learning about the world and would like a visual representation n npros the globe has a lot of detail specifically it has the us states which is a feature that is not easy to find for mid priced globes the size is good so the different regions are relatively easy to recognize no need for magnifying glass there are also raised areas to represent mountainous regions which is pretty cool ncon the biggest issue is the huge blue band around the center of the globe which goes through several continents the product picture show the band so there was no misrepresentation by the seller i just did n t realize how prominent it would be
10;2;7;0.3219171615452576;really not much to say we re homeschoolers and use this globe all the time it seems well made great size not so big you ca n t sit it anywhere not so small you ca n t see anything the raised relief is well done i ve tried several other globes and been disappointed so i m speaking from some experience here n ni would recommend this globe it s just good

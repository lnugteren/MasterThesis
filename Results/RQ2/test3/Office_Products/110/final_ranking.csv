0;53;67;0.8871135588536276;before going into my details about this peripheral i need to qualify my remarks i do n t have a lot of experience with photo and negative scanners so therefore i limited myself to 4 stars i do n t know what makes a really great photo negative scanner though from a non expert point of view ease of use and convenience would have to rate high compared to the results i have only done some test scans with the v500 and my initial impressions are that it scans quickly i am using a vista sp1 desktop w 2gb ram an amd dual core processor and a vista performance rating of 5 and my biggest learning curve will be with the software in terms of selecting the optimal scan settings in brief there are three modes home full auto and professional with the professional mode offering the most options one feature that made me choose the v500 besides the price was that it comes with digital ice so that was one of the first things i tested my initial results were disappointing there seemed to be no difference between scans without and with ice i got better results by simply manually dusting my negatives with a soft brush and blowing with a rubber squeeze bulb i even sent an e mail to epson tech support expressing my disappointment and asked for their help while waiting for their reply over the course of a few days i noticed that i had been using my scanner with the usb cable plugged into a hub i reconnected the scanner by plugging it directly to the computer and ran my test scans again voila digital ice worked this time it did get rid of dust on a dusty negative though i would still probably manually dust all slides or negatives before scanning in the future when epson tech support e mailed back they said they could not come up with a solution to my problem i had to tell them that i fixed it by connecting the scanner directly to the computer rather than using the hub do n t forget also to clean the scanner glass and the glass in the scanner lid before scanning this scanner has a maximum optical resolution of 6400 dpi but i do n t know what i would ever scan at that resolution epson provides plastic templates to hold and align negatives and slides for scanning the negatives or slides just have to be placed into the appropriate space you need to be aware of whether the shiny side of the negative or slide is facing up or down the software can rotate the image after scanning the scanning software is smart in the sense that it will separate the images after scanning whether you are scanning two strips of negatives 6 images per strip or four slides at a time the preview window will show each image separately and each image can be tweaked separately speed was not an issue with my test scans though i did not scan at higher than 1200 dpi scanners do n t occupy much shelf space at computer retailers these days and they do n t get much attention lately in the technology news but for those of use who transitioned from film cameras and who have thousands of prints negatives and slides still sitting in shoeboxes albums and binders scanners can not be ignored in making the conversion to digital imagery complete
1;76;24;0.8746245023724921;i still shoot film so i need a scanner that will do a great job scanning negatives and wo n t break the bank so far the epson v500 is making me very happy it s very easy to set up but i wish the included instructions were more comprehensive i spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out why the machine would not scan my negatives as film when i placed the negative carrier on the scanning bed instead i was getting a scanned image of the negative carrier very frustrating after spending about 10 minutes googling i finally found my answer apparently you need to remove the white reflector underneath the top cover which is not mentioned in the instruction guide after this is removed the scanner automatically detects the negative holder and begins scanning the negatives as film rather than a photo the reflector easily slides out by pulling on a tab located near the top edge of the cover n nbefore settling on the v500 i had looked at the v600 and the canon 9000f but chose the v500 for the affordable price and mostly positive reviews plus i did n t really see a difference between the v600 and the v500 except i think v600 has the ability to scan bigger negatives which is not necessary for me i decided against canon because of the cost and the fact that epson has a better reputation for scanners the scan quality is great and any adjustments can easily be done in photoshop now if you re comparing the v500 to a v700 then you need to stop because the v700 costs significantly more so the scanned images should be significantly better but if you re looking for an affordable scanner that produces impressive results the v500 is a great option n ni do n t have any issues with the negative carrier like others do it holds the film and does a fine job when placed in the machine yes it s a bit flimsy but nothing to complain about the software is a no brainer just download it onto your system i use an imac and you re ready to go there are several scanning modes and i always have it set at professional in order to access advanced menus n noverall i m very satisfied with this machine and plan to keep it around for a long time
2;73;18;0.8470233231743635;the following comments were written after i scanned in 3000 photos some slides and one film strip my project involves scanning old family photos slides and negatives my old scanner could n t do the slides and took a really long time on the photos one of the time hogs was scanning groups of photos and having to make multiple copies then crop the individual ones out in a photo editor n nthe good n n1 over three times faster than my old scanner for color photos n2 scans multiple photos to individual files this works really well n3 fast prescan n nthe bad mostly minor annoyances n n1 grayscale b w photo scanning speed is about the same as my old scanner n2 after you define a new folder in the file save browse window simply pressing ok creates an error message about permissions when you try to scan in order for it to work after you type in the new file name you need to click anywhere in the window then press ok n nonce you spend some time trying the various settings it s easy to get into a rythm i found that although the scanner is relatively fast i had time to edit the pictures with an external editor in my case the excellent and fast windows live photo gallery while the next frame is scanning this keeps you busy so no time is wasted although i tried the thumbnail mode on loose photos spaced at least 0 8 apart the photo finder algorithm included the white borders so i had to crop the pictures manually anyway if your pictures are borderless you should be ok because of that i opted to use the normal mode on full pages of mounted photos selecting the crop areas manually in the prescan image this was much faster and i did n t have to unmount the photos the prescan image was shown in a medium size window on my 1920 x 1080 screen and could n t be enlarged to allow more accurate selection of the individual photos you can zoom into the images one at a time but the use of an larger prescan window would be must faster the response of the scanner can lag a bit during the selection process sometimes i had to wait a few seconds to get my cursor back my computer is has an i7 quad processor with a memory of 8 gigs so i doubt it is the computer s fault the ability to name files with a prefix and dash number on the fly saved a lot of time there are tons of image editing adjustments which worked well but for me the necessary settings varied so much between scans that i decided to do them afterward with a photo editor that proved to be faster i scanned a few slides with excellent results except for the borders although the slides fit well into the slide holder the actual image area of my slides varied considerably and again i was forced to crop many images in an external photo editor ca n t a good algorithm be designed to find the edges my film strip scan was an old 110 color negative film and there was no way to mount it in the film holder which seemes to be designed for 35mm film the holder locates the film in the scan area so i placed the film in that space letting it bow up a bit since there was no way to keep it flat with a little help from my photo editor after the images were massaged and colors corrected the results were surprising not great but quite good given the conditions although my computer has both usb2 and 3 connections they were both about the same speed with the scanner although file transfer speed was not a problem for me a tad faster would be helpful n noverall it s a great scanner and i would recommend it if you have a big scanning project
3;82;15;0.8137661285078654;i purchased this scanner after much research in december 2011 trying to find a replacement for a beloved canoscan lide500 that no longer worked with my mac once i d upgraded to lion os 10 7 i knew that i could use image capture or import from scanner to make a scan using my old machine and preview or acrobat but this is a cumbersome process and i often need to quickly scan a chapter from a library book which is laborious work if the scanning process is slow n ni discovered that the epson perfection v500 photo scanner did not work with lion that is i can go through the same cumbersome process with the exception that acrobat wo n t even recognize the scanner after some work i managed to get preview to recognize the scanner but working with it is not easy for one thing it keeps switching the field to a narrow band across the middle of the page despite many efforts to fix this n ni ve spent hours on the phone with epson support which sounds like it s in india they were not particularly helpful and there was apparently no way of even getting an email notification once the 10 7 driver came out n ni just checked again today and finally the new driver is out i am hoping it will work if not perhaps at least this review will be helpful to others having problems n nmoreover one major reason i spent the money on this scanner is because it is bundled with abbyy finereader or a version of it abbyy finereader sprintplus ocr i ca n t access that program because the cd is unhelpfully set up as an installer meaning that it refuses to run because of my os the version of abbyy finereader on the cd might be perfectly compatible with my computer but i ca n t get to it to find out n nfinally the scanner is heavy and clunky it comes with three different cords and takes up too much room on my desk boy do i miss my nice little nearly portable canon
4;55;21;0.8035662700024813;so i personally love film restoration i love watching documentaries on how they do it the process etc so for some time i ve been wanting to get a scanner that was reasonably priced but could deliver the results i was looking for n nlet s get one thing straight if your photo sucks it sucks this scanner wo n t make some ill focused poorly lit severely damaged photo look like high art i get the feeling some people are expecting that out of this scanner also keep in mind film negatives will be extremely grainy that is how chemical film works so do n t expect a smooth glossy image n ni ve gotten some amazing results with the scans from the original negatives details that have been lost or have n t been seen in years patterns on the wallpaper writing on paper pinned to the fridge individual strands of loose hair also you get a bigger picture from scanning the original negative than you do by scanning in the 4x6 print as the 4x6 print is actually a cropped down photo from the original negative n ni ca n t think of a single reason to not use digital ice on every scan of course it makes the scanning process longer but when it cleans up scratches scuffs bends dust you d never know some damage is irreversible i had a few negatives with water damage that scanned in but the area of water damage had become quite garbled nothing the scanner can do on that end n nother features like color restoration grain reduction unsharp mask and backlight correction should be used on an as needed basis not for every photo color restoration should be used on photos that are either hued too blue or too orange yellow and only on those occasions backlight correction when desperately needed should be used grain reduction set to high the photo wo n t be flawless but your results will be much better n ni got this scanner 5 days ago and i have scanned in over 200 strips of negative film since then all the while doing other things on my computer playing graphic intensive video games watching netflix facebook ing etc and it did not affect the processing time of the scanner nor did the scanner slow down my system one bit n nif you are looking for an affordable way to digitize your family photos from the original negatives and see them in a way you ve never seen them before this is definitely the scanner for you n non added note one hour photos there is no point on scanning at a higher dpi when film is rushed to develop in under an hour you lose a ton of quality did you take your family photos on a disposal camera again no need for a ridiculously high dpi i ve scanned in most of my family photos at 2400 dpi and got a good enough quality to print on a 13in x 19in print
5;2;6;0.7759889627049241;i just purchased this scanner primarily to scan my 1000 slides at first i was a bit reluctant because this model is brand new to the market and i was concerned about those inital bugs but i know that epson makes a good product so i took the chance and am i glad that i did it has some outstanding features n1 very simple to set up and then operate i scanned my first photo within 30 minutes of unwrapping the package no problems with the software and the on line user s manual is really easy to follow n2 very fast scanning the scan including preview of photos is unbelievably fast but i was really surprised at the speed of scanning slides a normal scan without using digital ice correction of 4 slides took less than 5 minutes compared to some of the other products i ve been reading about this is lightning speed n3 very quiet when scanning photos you can barely hear it a little more noise when scanning slides but certainly not bothersome n4 offers 3 modes to choose from auto home and professional the auto is the easiest and results in a very good photo the home and professional offer a number of correcting features more with the professional mode i am an intermediate photoshop user and the professional mode was as close to using an editing software as i ve ever seen the scan time slows down a bit when you use these correcting tools but again no big deal once i get the hang of it i m sure it will speed up the amount of time i will need with photoshop n5 digital ice is fantastic this feature is used when only scanning film or slides i first scanned slides without using it the waulity was very good but my slides are almost 30 years old so there was enough noise mostly dust and fade in them to be noticeable something i was resigned to fix in photoshop i then scanned them using ice and was amazed the noise was completely gone and the colors were remarkably restored the photoshop work is going to be a piece of cake n6 the price is unbelievable for what you get i ve seen scanners costing much much more that are n t nearly as good as this one nin summary epson has come up with a real winner i really ca n t find anything negative to say if you re looking for a quality scanner at a great price look no further this is the one
6;3;7;0.7325154132186296;i absolutely love this scanner i can not say enough good things about it after my gran passed we found boxes of photos and negatives of the family wanting to keep these i bought this scanner and i am so happy i did the interface is so easy my mom can use it it can be point and click if you want it to be but it has the technical functions that let you really play with images it renders negatives repairs damaged photos tears and wrinkles etc and can even adjust the color balance of old photos for getting rid of that weird yellow tint on all the photos from the 60 70s i think the only con is that i wish it had more customization features but for me this was the closest i could get to professional equipment without the professional price tag
7;24;8;0.7161615181393084;over the past 37 years i have shot thousands of photographs on print and slide film while i stored them away in a climatically controlled environment with proper image preservation techniques thus many of the color negatives have started to either fade or being the color shift process the only film that is still 100 percent stable after all of these years are the kodachrome slides which in hindsight i wish i would have chosen more often over the years as the film of choice however i tended to chose print film so i could share these treasured images with my friends at the time n ni did a lot of research into image scanners and chose this epson model over several others epson has much better image resolution quality than products from their competitors this unit allows you to choose 35mm color print or slide film or even some of the medium format versions like 680 film however it does a magnificent job on various sized prints n nmoreover i also loved the fact this model came with adobe editing software to help enhance some of the images that have become faded or damaged over the years some really faded photographs from the 1950s look like they were shot yesterday on a digital camera i really feel this scanner was a wise investment and with over 10 000 images that i have been scanned it s still going strong i highly recommend it

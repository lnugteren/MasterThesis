0;5;131;0.8988162103379672;good news bad news i purchased this scanner based on numerous positive reviews i was looking primarily for a negative slide scanner but i did not want to lay out the bucks for a dedicated slide scanner i actually would have considered one of the higher end epsons like the v500 but i was sold on the led illumination and quickstart capabilities of the 8800f for the record i have owned an epson 1650 and an epson 1240u upgrading each time to take advantage of some new capability none of my scanners ranging all the way back to my first plustek has died on me n nfirst the bad news negative scanning is nsg not so good that is not to say that the canon is not good compared to other scanners but it takes about 1 minute to scan a single negative panel at 1200dpi and it takes about 4 minutes to scan at 2400dpi the math works 2x linear equals 4x area after doing a couple of test scans i came to the conclusion that the incremental quality of 2400dpi was not worth 3 minutes per slide for a family photo archive project i was also coming to the conclusion that 1 minute per negative panel would not really work for me n non to the good news i decided to scan 4 prints i took them out of one of our family photo albums and started the scan whoa the machine scanned the photos in the amount of time it took my epson 1650 to do a preview scan the wonders of modern technology i checked the default resolution and it turns out to be 300dpi i had experimented in the past with resolutions up to 4800dpi for family photos and finally realized that 300dpi is sufficient for all normal 4x6 etc size prints i only use higher resolutions for smaller prints n nthe canon guys have fixed every problem i have ever had with a scanner the negative holder does a good job of flattening out curved negatives the lid is heavy which is good so i do n t have to dig out a fat book to help flatten curved photo prints the led illuminators come on instantly so no waiting for the fluorescent lights to warm up and finally it s fast n nlast but not least if you use their scanning utility with the zippy name of mp navigator ex it puts exif information if you store your images in jpeg i have always thought that would be an excellent improvement to scanners n ni have been scanning family type photos for about 10 years now and i have to say that the canon canoscan 8800f addresses every improvement i have dreamed up on my own for flatbed scanners now if they can make a scanner that will scan 4 negatives in 7 seconds i will deem them perfect in the meantime i have to rate them as almost perfect n nthe only reason i give them 4 stars is that i technically purchased the unit to scan negatives and found 1 minute per negative panel to be a slight disappointment for normal print photo scanning i would give them a 5 easily the control panel for amazon does not let me select 4 5 n naddendum n2008 02 02 i have used this scanner to scan some more slides they still take a while but i have the slides what am i going to do the only way to get the exif information is if you use the mp navigator program i have tried using the twain facility with both irfanview and picasa the scans are fine but no exif information i was concerned after scanning some whale watching slides as the 2nd 4th panels would not have the edges of the slides detected well the water was deep blue after scanning slides with landlubber type backgrounds grass dirt etc all of those had slide edges detected properly all i had to do with the whale watching photos was crop to edit out some black borders n nmy epson 1650 would sometimes screw up the orientation of the slide it would decide that a landscape slide should be portrait cutting off the sides or a portrait slide was landscape cutting off the top and bottom it was a major nuisance when that happened and even if i attempted to preview the slide multiple times rotating it for some slides it would never get the image right so far i have not had that problem with the 8800f
1;102;19;0.8888616466739813;we decided to digitalize some of our old pictures i have an agfa snapscan 1212u and love it but after a few hours of scanning it s showing its age the scans take a long time and progress was definitely limited by 90s technology so i did a lot of research on the web it seemed to come down to two scanners for photo scanning canon s canoscan 8800f and epson s perfection v500 both retail for the same price but the epson is much cheaper discounted including on amazon the epson perfection v600 is not discounted and i did n t really see a difference between it and the v500 so i never considered it n nbased on the reviews the 8800f and v500 seemed to be pretty much equivalent but on most reviews the canon usually was the preferred scanner chosen the overwhelming 5 star reviews on amazon seemed to support what others on the web were saying so based on those numbers i chose the 8800f n nok on to my experience the scanner shipped immediately even though i picked free shipping showed up in 3 days from phoenix the scanner itself has a slightly larger footprint than my agfa and not as tall the lid kind of surprised me it is thick with some kind of electronics in it there is a cord in the back connecting the top to the base of the scanner the top is hinged and can not expand so it s not really designed to scan books at least you do n t have to worry about copyrighted material there are a number of scanner function buttons on the front of the lid i do n t plan on using them other than the power button as i prefer to use software to do scanning operations a minor complaint is that the scanner has to be manually turned on maybe there is a way around this i do n t know my agfa turned on automatically when i requested a scan but this is trivial the unit is the standard black and grey and matches dell s xps color scheme as big as the scanner is i wish they would put the power brick inside the unit other than that no complaints about the physical appearance of the scanner n nnow for my practical experience i am running windows 7 64 bit on a dell i7 xps studio 12gb ram 2tb disk space so no issues on power memory or storage loaded all the software without any problems and did the test scan n nthe first thing i noticed was the sound when it scans it is a very high pitched whine not loud but a bit irritating to me on the return there is a noticeable servo whirl sound this is not a quiet scanner my wife was working next to me and asked what was that sound it was that noticeable and unusual maybe i m use to the agfa s gentle humming sound but the 8800f will definitely take some getting used to our hp 7410 all in one scanner is not as loud or irritating on scans n nthe scans are very fast compared to the agfa only a few seconds then it goes through a cycle of cropping sending the scan to a file and finally opening a photo editor as another reviewer has mentioned as it cycles through the steps it interrupts whatever else you may be doing i was going to check my email and when it sent the crop message it took me out of keying my userid i went back and keying in my password it bounced me out again to tell me it was saving the image then it started the photo editor and bounced me to that screen i think they need to work on this irritating feature n nthe scans i have mixed feelings here i tend to put several pictures on the scanner and do one scan for whatever reason on some scans it only returned 3 of 5 pictures scanned on others it failed to separate the pictures and i got 3 2 or 1 scan for the 5 pictures in various combinations the pictures were separated so there should n t have been any issue n nit also put a white edge to some pictures the pictures being scanned are all borderless but sometimes there is a white border on an edge it does n t seem to have deleted anything so i just crop it off in the editor n nother times there is a slight white edge added on a corner with a matching white edge on the opposite corner like the picture is n t straight but the software is suppose to handle this and it does most of the time but sometimes not i got in the habit of only doing 3 pictures at a time to avoid these issues but it still does it even then two of three will be fine it s the third one that has an issue sometimes even scanning one picture has the problem a few times i removed the good scans and rescanned the third picture without even moving it and it comes back fine on the rescan bit of a mystery here n nthe included software the box says it is windows 7 capable so i am guessing this is a current model of the scanner not one from 3 years ago i normally check for a trademark date but there is n t one on the box well the included default editor is arcsoft photostudio 5 5 and after the scan it tries to open it first thing it says is compatibility issues with your version of windows great do n t know if its windows 7 or 64 bit went to the arcsoft site and there it says photostudio is now windows 7 compatible unfortunately that is in version 6 well if you ignore the warning the application does launch and you can use it but i am cautious when it says it is not compatible who knows what may happen or if it crashes after spending an hour fixing a picture you can change the default photo editor easily so it is n t a big deal but something included that is n t useful for me n nadobe photoshop elements is also included it does n t seem to have any issues but it is version 5 the current release is version 8 i do n t mind being a version or two behind but 3 versions old i saw a review of the v500 that said they are shipping with version 7 maybe canon could n t work out as good a deal with adobe i use microsoft s digital image suite for 90 of my photo editing it s simple and does what i need i also have the full version of adobe photoshop so it is n t an issue but another useless software that i wo n t use photoshop elements 4 0 for macintosh is also included for you apple users out there n nthe only other software that may be useful is scansoft omnipage se ocr but i already have and use readiris pro 12 so i have n t tried the included ocr i guess there are other programs included but i m not real familiar with them and probably wo n t use them n ni went back to re read the reviews on the scanner it was then i noticed most of the reviews for both the 8800f and the v500 seem to be more focused on scanning negatives and slides i may have been mistaken in selecting this scanner for just scanning old pictures i tried scanning color negatives and it does a great job there but be aware it is very very slow compared to regular photo scans the scanning window said it would take 7 minutes to do 4 pictures it did take a while i do n t think 7 minutes but a very noticeable amount of time the white pad on the lid must also be removed and the negative holder 35mm looks like it will only hold 4 strips my main purpose is for photos and maybe the occasional negative so this is n t an issue n noverall i guess i am pleased with the scanner it is fast for picture scanning and the scans appear fine it works for what i got it for picture scanning and speed the scans are a bit softer than the prints and the color and exposure are a bit off but i m sure these can be corrected with software settings and definitely with a photo editor i will keep it rather than return it to try the epson but i can not in good conscience recommend it as highly as others the short comings in the software alone need to be noted i m sure the epson is just as accurate in the scans and has its own issues i sought a perfect solution to all my scanning needs and got a little less than that maybe my expectations are too high
2;92;96;0.8597628237432878;i was faced with the task of scanning about 1600 mounted 35 mm slides and felt i had to go with a big ticket scanner for for such a project reading reviews on amazon and elsewhere lead me to believe a much less expensive alternative might do the job i have been more than pleased with the canon 8800f like many others i gave a lot of weight to scan speed at a resolution of 2400 dpi it takes about four minutes to scan a batch of four slides but the limiting factor is the time it takes to pull the slides from their carousels and replace them after scanning so the scan time is not as great a factor as i thought and you would be amazed at the number of four minute chores you will find around the house while the scanner does it s thing i do n t use the scanning software to enhance the images at all but wait until a large batch is scanned and then use either the arcsoft or photoshop elements software that came bundled with the scanner to make modifications the unit is a terrific bargain with this software i m very pleased with the quality of the images produced nis there a downside yes unless i m missing something file management is frustrating if i run a session saving the scans to a folder in my pictures the program assigns numeric file names to the images in consecutive order great but if i then close the program and come back the next day i am unable continue with new file names where i left off the program starts from number one as though this is a new project very frustrating would i buy this product again yes definitely
3;20;59;0.8560284261364037;i have done some semi professional photography and have hundreds of 35mm negatives and numerous color positive slides and was in need of a film negative slide scanner for a marketing venture i did countless hours of research on the net and at manufacturer s websites funds were limited and i was torn between the canon canoscan 8800f and an espon 500 or 700 what sold me on the canon is that there was a lesser percentage of negative reviews than there is with the espons so i bought it and have given it a try and i must say that it was money well spent n njust so you know my computer setup is an emachines w6409 i m running windows xp media center addition sp3 and have all of the required updates it s a pentium 4 cpu running at 3 00ghz and i added more memory total 1 37 gb of ram i ve also installed a pioneer dvr 113np dvd burner with lightscribe and use it as my master with the stock dvd burner set up as the slave n nthere is a learning curve with this canon as there is with any new piece of equipment or software and yes scanning can take awhile and is dependent on the chosen scanning resolution i got fantastic results when scanning my sunset color positive slides in 4800 dpi with autotone off unsharp mask on remove dust and scratches high fading correction none grain correction low and backlight correction none these settings are in the scangear s software advanced mode i m currently scanning color negatives in 2400 dpi with equally good results i have a scan running as i write this review actually i ll try to include some photos that i ve scanned if it s possible to do so n nthe software that came with the scanner is ok and it does the job however i did have to delete and reinstall the scanner and drivers once because the scangear and or the driverscanner was freezing up on me as for software i m not a big microsoft fan but i very much like the microsoft digital image 2006 editor which i have as a trial it does what i want and need so right now when i scan a set of slides or negatives i have the scangear software open up the included adobe photoshop elements 5 00 for a quick visual review and to save the photos in the appropriate chosen directory i ll later edit in the ms digital image 2006 editor program n nin agreement with other reviews regarding the film holders yes they are a bit flimsy just use the gentleness and care that you d use for your priceless film slides and photos and you ll be fine n ntip nwhen i first used the scanner i got the following error ncannot scan for these reasons nthe original may not be set correctly nthe protective sheet may be put in place nthe lock switch may not be released nscanner driver will be closed ncode 2 178 0 nwell the original was set correctly and the scanner was not locked i scratched my head i knew that i had removed all of the protective plastic too upon searching canon s website for this error i found that there s a solid plastic backing on the inside of the lid that needed to be removed perhaps this is in the manual but hey i m a guy grin n ni m very happy with this scanner i think you will be too

5;15;132;0.8490009865430647;i ve owned many scanners i recently purchased this item to replace a canon 8400f that i wore out scanned 15 000 photos over a period of 15 months ni ve used the 8800 for a week now about 300 scanned items and i am nso impressed with the quality of the scans that i am planning to rescan nmost of the photos again yes the sharpness and color fidelity imparted with this scanner are so good i consider it worthwhile to redo about a years work of archiving ni started by rescanning some of the photos to see how the new scans compared with those from the 8400 i had used for my archives most comparisons showed the raw scan of the 8800 to be superior and never less than equal to the 8400 i really liked the 8400 i love the 8800 n nthe scanner is very fast the final scan of a 4x6 photo takes about 3 4 seconds i do about 100 pictures in an hour even with the need to tweak some using the canon navigator software you can do multiple pictures in one pass but i like to look at each picture individually and crop it as i scan none useful tip is to use the advanced mode and set the paper size to fit nthe most common size of your photos my typical photos are 4x6 or smaller so i use the 2 l landscape that creates a 7 x5 scan template i e the scanner only travels about 1 2 way down the platen each scan both saving ntime and potential wear and also eliminates the need to zoom to get na good size picture displayed for tweaking and cropping n ndid i mention that i love this scanner

7;135;89;0.8220785831619823;i ve worn out two flatbed scanners and one parallel port slide scanner over the years my sister had purchased the canon canoscan 8800f recently and loved it so i took her word and ordered one it s is the best i could have hoped for the 150 dpi setting is fast the 300 dpi setting is very fast compared to my scanners in the past the 600 dpi does bog down but i really do n t need my routine family photos scanned in this high of a resolution so i stick to the 300 dpi pretty much and the scans are excellent quality and color the software is amazing in the past when i ve laid like 4 6 photos on the glass then i ve had to separate each of them by cropping and then save this software separates the photos for me and i can just zip through saving each one using ctl s putting them all into one folder and then renaming them all using windows explore the slides are slower to scan but much faster than my previous scanner and the software also separates each slide for me also if a photo is washed out or fading the software has some awesome fixes for all sorts of problems one b w that was almost faded out totally was repaired like it had just been developed all details could be seen so i just ca n t praise this scanner enough or the software i went ahead and purchased the 2 year replacement warranty since i use a scanner a lot but have a feeling this scanner will prove to be hearty i also found amazon com had the best price on the scanner so i m happy with my purchase and i m plowing through the family photos and slides so much faster than in years gone by
8;24;87;0.8030307635460652;first of all flatbed scanners are difficult to find in retail stores neither best buy nor circuit city had them i reveiwed the most recent consumer reports testing of flatbed scanners in which canon scored as a best buy for the under 100 model i came down to two models the canon and the hp the hp model was lower in the consumer reports ratings but far higher in cost about 450 but it could scan more slides at a time for further research i went to hp s and canon s web sites for each of the models that was a big help i settled on the canon and i have not been disappointed i am extremely pleased with my purchase i have scanned about 1 000 black white photos that were 40 90 years old i have scanned about 20 slides i am scanning photos at 600 dpi slides at 2400 3600 dpi small contact prints from the 1930s 1940s were easily cleaned up with the enhance tools which removed dust spots the magic wand button on the tool bar gives one the ability to improve and restore original contrast and sharpen the photo from a variety of choices the result is a beautifully restored photo the same holds true for old color photos and slides 20 60 years old many color photos showed signs of fading and loss of color these can be restored to their original quality as described above slides are a longer process but you can do 4 at a time one problem was figuring out how to do slides you need to open the scanner lid and remove the white backing by pressing the button at the top of the lid then lay the slide holder down on the glass
9;17;95;0.7912974438018031;updated 12 aug 08 i used this scanner for 14 hours one day and it did n t flinch i was more tired than my scanner but a few tips since beginning to use this particular scanner n1 invest in flatbed scanner cleaning supplies this is crucial to keeping excessive noise from being added to your scanned image use a dust remover air bulb or compressed air plus clean the bed frequently another tip if you are scanning a large number of photographs or in my case old 1900 s type wash hands frequently keep finger tips clean or as i state below invest in nylon gloves to handle photos n2 i m scanning film negatives and color positives that are very fragile and one broke brittle while moving it to the scanner my only suggestion is to use archive quality gloves for old negatives and glass mounted photos n3 buy and use a film cleaning solution and handle each one carefully i know that goes without saying but i ve found a lot of bw shots have fingerprints on their face and they add more noise to end item n4 i m not promoting anything but i m using a photoshop plug in noise ninja to control excessive noise gained through scanning and kodak roc for color restoration processes this saves me hours of color matching and testing swatches i still need to adjust for some but this saves me hours of computer time n5 i ve surpassed 2k scanned photos so far and it s still working like a charm i have another 1 2 million to go n5 120 film negatives have become a problem perhaps it s due to age but i m running into difficulty getting the scanner to recognize them it s been hit and miss i suspect the top side scanning lamp may not be wide enough or bright enough to sense the negative nafter 919 scans of various kinds of media i have a mixed bag of reviews beginning with 35mm slides and negatives works great black and white 120 size came out great it took me a while to make 120 work work though the carrier was too small for large format 4x6 so i had to improvise and that took a lot of time once i learned to use large format then i tested it with 110 negatives no luck with those these are too small for the scanner to sense and i pushed the capabilities of this scanner overall it worked as designed quick and fast ni also used the advanced simple and multiscan settings and they worked perfect nscanned documents looked like the originals after scanning and printing nin summary i used each setting and they worked flawlessly my request to canon is to add a carrier for larger format film it would make it easier to scan ni used this with a mac new version and it works really great if i really get technical and want professional grade reproductions that s when i go to photo labs but those visits are rare this is a great scanner for the price and it did everything i asked without failing or crashing nfor mid range scanning and non professional photo work this is a great scanner but if you are a professional and demand lab perfect photos this may not be what you want but for my use semi pro and commercial work this is perfect for my use

11;50;14;0.7675588488946491;i purchased this scanner from amazon and received it almost immediately after every 3 4 scans it would not work and would give a message that i had to restart the scanner it would then work for another 3 4 scans and then i would have to restart it again i did everything to correct the problem finally i called canon tech support they were very good and supportive they could n t solve the problem and after an hour and a half decided that the hardware was bad and sent me a replacement it did the same thing i later read that one reviewer said this scanner does not work properly with xp and canon never updated the software to fix the problem i returned the one to canon and the other one to amazon when it worked the scans were excellent canon support was great and amazon was good about a refund that is the only reason i did n t give it all zeroes i bought an epson scanner from staples and it works beautifully in addition to costing less

13;109;47;0.7581680226590698;i had about twelve carousels of 35mm slides that i rescued from my parents basement a few years ago and i ve been looking for a high quality film scanner ever since i found other film scanners for less at some other places but i kept reading review after review on how bad the output was scans were very dark or just not sharp i read the reviews for the canon 8800f here on amazon and was amazed at how everybody was fanatical about the quality of this scanner i purchased this scanner from amazon last week it arrived yesterday and i quickly and easily hooked it up to my computer within minutes i had scanned my first batch of slides and i was floored at the quality the images looked fantastic and very bright it looked as though i had scanned a photograph in obviously the scanner will only faithfully reproduce the condition of the slide but the included software does a great job at color correction removing scratches and other special effects i m scanning my slides at the highest possible resolution 4800dpi and it takes about 7 9 minutes to complete the process but it is worth the wait n ni m having a blast looking through years of slides and reliving memories if you have 35mm slides or negatives you absolutely must get this scanner right now

15;143;67;0.7435461560961386;i placed the order on april 14th and received the scanner via free shipping ups standard on the 16th outstanding set up and installation was a breeze works so much better than my old hp scanjet 5300c my first session of use was the scanning of 75 old b w photos scanning was simple and straight forward never a single problem during use for approx 1 5 hours the only thing i noticed was that there were the scattered white dots as others had mentioned mostly all were in the dark gray or black solid areas so overall i was a bit concerned as they were very noticeable i wiped the scanner glass and this did not help at all however once i imported the jpg files into my photoshop program all of the white dots were gone i am not sure if it is a reading problem of the software scanner or what but for me the solution was simple enough convert to photoshop files and no further problems overall i am very happy with this purchase especially with the speed of delivery absolutely no need to upgrade shipping that s for sure
16;52;6;0.7344565563111453;i needed a quality scanner to digitize 1700 slides for archiving the canoscan is a well designed and solid scanner but the slide insert held only 4 slides which meant a lot more scans i also noticed a glitch in the software involving how the scanner decided the picture area of the slide the actual photo area of my slides had a wide variety of aspect ratios since i did n t want to have to go in and manually adjust the scan size for each slide i wanted to set a larger default and then crop the photos later in a photoshop elements n ni contacted customer service about this and after over an hour of troubleshooting on the phone the rep told me that this was a glitch in the software and since it was n t typically an issue for customers it was n t something being fixed in future updates i must say appreciated the honesty of the customer service rep and the time and effort he spent trying to get to the bottom of the problem if nothing else the customer service made feel great about the prospect of buying other canon products in the future n nin the end i did return the scanner and picked up an hp model scanjet g4050 that held 16 slides at a time and did n t have that problem i m satisfied with that one n nwhile the canoscan did n t work for my particular need i did play around with the scanner and thought it was a reasonably priced and overall good quality scanner
17;29;50;0.7219566822591871;pros great image quality resolution quick and quiet ncons mechanical longevity after about 20 days of significant use over the course of an year the glass platten came unglued i was scanning mostly slides film and photos no books so no extra pressure weight on the platten nstrangely the platten is not supported by anything underneath it is simply suspended from the plastic frame by glue the glue is still tacky therefore its strength may have been affected by room temperature however the whole time the scanner has always been at home and not exposed to more than 80 deg f nwith the platten hanging on one side it contacts the scanner head and causes it to stick or the drive belt to skip with major noise and wear on the plastic gear i reattached the platten with superglue and it works but will likely be a temporary fix i would be extremely careful loading the platten in any way especially since the plastic suspension frame is flexible and loads the glue in shear a simple support on the underside of the glass would have eliminated the issue
18;55;7;0.7184313104616501;i have a macbookpro running os x 10 6 4 the software included was slightly outdated and did not work for this operating system however it took only a few minutes to download the updated version and i was up and running i love the fact the you can scan two strips of 35 mm film at the same time and then select only the scans that you wish to save the ability to rotate the images if you should happen to place the film strips in backwards or upside down is also very time saving
19;40;10;0.6830575735980164;we have liked canon scanners in the past and this canon canoscan 8800f seems to be living up to canon s reputation for quality products that work well with macs i chose this particular model to replace 4 aging agfa scanners at our school in part because it came bundled with some ocr software i was very disappointed to find that the ocr software canon included was a version that was a couple of years old and not compatible with the mac os 10 6 i felt there should at least have been a disclaimer to that effect but instead we had to wait to find that out until the installer of the ocr software failed i had to spend another 90 dollars to get that software piece from a third party vendor that meant the very good price we found through amazon was n t such a great price after all other than the ocr problem the scanner is very good the no wait scanning made possible by using led lamps is very much faster than our old scanners that is something important when you have a line of students in your class waiting to scan

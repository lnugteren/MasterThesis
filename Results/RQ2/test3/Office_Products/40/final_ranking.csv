0;5;10;0.8276591130093732;as an obsessive compulsive middle management suck up i knew that i would ultimately own a palm of some sort deciding which pda to purchase proved extremely difficult nfirst wince devices were ruled out they re just too darned expensive to justify being able to listen to media files and have your batteries run out every other day because of the power drain from the color display plus i m sick and tired of windows i wanted something new nthat leads to the palm platform next question palm or handspring i asked a friend who bought a handspring about a month ago do n t do it he said i spend more time fixing this thing than i do using it for any relevant purpose nwell that left the 3com palm series now do i get the palm iiix the palm v or the palm vii nthe palm vii is just to darned expensive it s up there with the wince devices and i just do n t have the need or the desire to be able to 1 click stuff from amazon com while i m in the middle of the sahara if i m going to shell out that kind of money i may as well get a cassiopeia or whatever it is called ni liked the looks of the palm iiix but i had to wonder why the palm v was consistently outselling the iiix nafter a little research i ca n t believe that anybody would shell out another 100 for a palm v your hard earned b franklin gets you a smaller fancier case and no capacity for memory expansion i settled for a palm iiix a leather case some styli and tiger woods golf and ending up spending 250 ni no longer need to carry around the 10 pound paper organizer that used to store my life history and marked me as obsessive compulsive or just plain disorganized i can take notes and schedule meetings on the bus and i can play a round of golf without leaving the comfort of my own bathroom george jetson and sigmund freud would be proud
1;29;25;0.789935728908519;i have had a palm for the past two years and found i can not live without it it is not only the built in applications which make my life easier but the thousands of 3rd party applications available for free or next to nothing on the internet which expand the use of my palm to something i use 20 times a day there is software which will allow you to track your banking and merge the data with quicken or other banking software store maps look up a zip code or area code download entire books play games create shopping lists and with a modem even let you surf the internet or send and receive e mail and faxes i even have my entire cd collection of over 600 cd s stored by artist title and song name which i converted from a spreadsheet and stored on my palm when i go to the record store to find new songs i can instantly see if i have a particular song on another disk the endless expandibility via 3rd party applications is probably the palm iiix best feature
2;14;6;0.7552989296050032;it s a great machine and i m glad i purchaced the iiix i ve seen the v and the vii and the iiix is the best i do wish i had waited a little longer for the color version but that does n t really matter for me because i use the midi software more than anything else the memo pad is cool too i take notes in class and print them out with my desktop comp i also have a color cover and that makes it look brighter the backlit screen is great n i also researched the handspring visor but the color display was hard on the batteries and the memory says it s upgradable but i have n t seen any proof yet nso buy the iiix if you do n t care about color and if you need the extra 2 megs
3;17;9;0.7489931901159356;it s been about a month since i got my palm iiix since then i m more organized than i ve ever been i decided to get myself a palm pilot for two reasons i hated having to manually update my monthly planner whenever a new year rolled in things like birthdays anniversaries etc another reason was because i wanted all my contact information to be in one single place i had these info spread out all around me like a wild fire some at home at work in the bathroom ah just kidding on the bathroom but you get the point right with this palm i can have upto 12 000 people in my address book i have 100 so far and i ve been telling people that the 10 000th person to go into my palm address book gets free dinner from me ha nnow then the reason i bought palm iiix over visor and other palm products was due to various reasons i did a intense research to find out which product would best fill my needs visor had the cool design going and maybe cool features like modules that can be added to turn your visor into mp3 players etc but from what i found out these feature were not being fully utilized just yet maybe in one more year someone said the reason i went w iiix over other versions e g v vii was because it had 4 megs of memory plus the price was right ni ve downloaded a lot of programs and installed them into my palm w ease ni ve only had a problem once and that was when my palm was hotsync ing w my computer and something happened and it kind of froze however i was able to soft reset easily by pressing that little button in the back noverall this is an excellent all around product even for a first time user like me n bingolian
4;32;23;0.6826962836511289;i bought palm iiix last semester it was very helpfull for me i was able to keep track of all my home works and dead lines this think actually pumped up my gpa if you are a student just go for it its very easy to use and has a lots of free applications and games in the internet even better this thing has a flash rom which means the os is upgradable the upgrades are also free in the net not only that you can also share information with other palm iii v or vii organizers through the ir transmitter for this price you ca n t get any thing better
5;20;5;0.6260895455079631;first i have to agree with the electronics fan from chicago although my palm got the date right some of the pixels on the screen would stay lit no matter what program was running at first the customer care center with palm accused me of dropping it or something physical damage they told me it would cost me 100 us to have it replaced i assumed a new unit this really irrtated me when i bought it dec 99 it worked fine when i replaced the batteries once i started to have problems like this eventually after some serious pissiness on the phone with representitive they offered me a used unit i sympathize with the electronics fan after all it does n t even feel like mine call me crazy but i bought mine not someone else s so far the used palm has worked fine but i would really like them to fix their mistakes for us insted of shipping off the other misfit products to their customers

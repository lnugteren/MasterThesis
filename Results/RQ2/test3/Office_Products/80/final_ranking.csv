0;40;53;0.8485537514287097;our office has been urging us to use microsoft outlook planner scheduler to schedule all of our meetings and appointments i was originally keeping appointments in the old franklin day planner however there was no way to synchronize the franklin planner with the outlooks scheduler hence i missed a lot of meetings the palm v has been an excellent tool to coordinate this ni looked at the psions however they were very big and cumbersome as compared to the palm v size does matter if i wanted a laptop i would have gotten one the compact size of the palm v is a major benefit and the fact that it synchronizes with my pc makes this great ni have several problems with it however the first is when the palm v is in my pocket the cover sometimes closes on the buttons on the front and you hear a clicking sound i am sure this kills the battery let alone annoying i have looked into a hard case but now you start to get back into the larger size issue the other problem i have had with the palm v is that the touch sensitive screen has lost its touch it got to the point where i could not even use the palm v at all it was not responsive to any touch of the stylus it just locked up i eventually had to reboot and it seemed to have cured the problem but it is slower than when i first purchased it and still is erratic in its touch repsonse has anyone else had this problem i have almost gotten to the point where i have quit using it maybe the psion will win out noverall i think it is a helluva tool as long as it works
1;13;74;0.8376294381017964;this small peace of equipment has made life much easier for me in the past months while in meetings i can take notes with the grafitti option i can immediately add tasks to my to do list while still in the meeting this small friend reminds me to call home writea letter or to make a phone call while busy working i write letters compose email when the issue comes up and send them in the evening appointments my secretary makes in my desktop computer are automatically transfered in a matter of seconds to my palm v and vice versa so that we have the same appointment information i can go on for some time but in short i ll say this is an improvement of working life i have never experienced before and it is beautiful too i have a few wishes though maybe the screen could have another type of lighting in the future and maybe the company could add sketching options it would be nice to see the grafitti letters forming like in some other palm computers i have seen you have five stars and four stars i would like to give it four and a half when the improvements i mentionde will be implemented it will be a five star for me other palms i have seen i rated only three because they are bulky and the display is not as simple as that of the palmv and the problem with the batteries is for always over with your palm v
2;48;35;0.8228875692033288;i received the palm v as a birthday present at first i thought that it would take forever to learn how to enter information using the graffiti language but within a couple of hours i had mastered the basic letters and most of the symbols i am not a sale person or one who keeps track of any business type of information i planned to use the schedule and the expenses the majority of the time i found that the handbook for the palm v is very user friendly and most quesitons could be answered by use of the handbook the only complaint that i have that you can not edit the categories under the expenses type or add any expense type it is strickly aimed at the business persons it would be great to be able to add or delete expense types other than that this is a great tool for any person and really easy to learn how to use the cost is finally coming down to make it worth buying do n t pass this up for any reason give it a try i know that you will get hooked just like i did of the palm v
3;7;57;0.7873102417149557;i finally decided to spend the extra for the palm v and give my old palm iii to my dad afterall i loved the styling but more importantly wanted the slimmer size nunfortunately when you use the hard cover that comes with the palm v and put it in your pocket it causes the power button to turn on and then the up down key constantly clicks huh nso then i went out and got the hard case a rip off if you ask me causing the palm v to be just as thick as my palm iii that left me wondering why i bothered spending all that extra money to get a palm no smaller than the one i already had ndad can i get my palm iii back
4;45;9;0.7778470014898397;over the last years i went from a nokia communicator phone pda to a nec mobile pro 400 windows ce and ultimately to a palm v actually palm iii with a v upgrade i must say the palm is n t my favourite among the above mentionned pdas non the plus side nthe interface is very pleasant to use it is small in size and easy to write while standing unlike keyboard devices the hot sync synchronizes seemlessly with your address book email etc and there are many software available as well as website where you can subscribe to channels or download information straight to the palm non the minus side nalthough it is a nice device to keep diary and track of your expenses etc the lack of keyboard means that to enter any long piece of text is laborious consequently it you are expecting from your pda to be able to say type an email or some notes while on the road this is the wrong device there are many software around but if you examine it more closely many are not very powerful for instance i was very pleased to be able to download a map from mapquest but without the ability to zoom or search the map it is of limited use palm users are often excited by the possibility of downloading email from the inbox with my previous nokia communicator i could download and send email from the internet using my regular isp unlike palm vii which requires a proprietary system subscription so to download emails from my pc only fails to appear as a very useful to me i was also irritated by the fact that by default it download all emails in the inbox folder of outlook while synchronizing which i had to delete one by one i know it is possible to buy a keyboard but the keyboard being too large to be carried i do n t see the point of that nconclusion nif you like elegant and simple to use devices i e if you are a mac user for instance the palm may be for you especially if you intend to use it mostly to keep your address book and diary if you seek a pda also to type notes use interactive maps and generally expect more than a electronic diary i would recommend a psion windows ce or the wonderful and versatile nokia communicator phone
5;39;43;0.7563834898594208;i have been using the palm iii for a long time and then switched to the palm v this gadget is really the best except for one thing i could n t download my data to my new g3 macs and powerbook technicians say the g3 s do n t have a pc card to accomodate the mac packs i wonder why what i do instead is download them in my old powerbook 1400c nevertheless it still is a great gadget and i never leave home without it
6;77;26;0.7259835736161325;this was the worst thing i ever bought i thought it would help me to get organized like the name suggests but instead all i found was hours of trouble trying to get this thing set up once i finally got it working it said it downloaded my mail but all it did was succesfully delete a letter from my boss it included the deadline for a project that i never recieved thus i did not make the deadline and was fired i was completely disorganized for weeks while i tried to get a hold of everything i lost i think that the people who named this combobulation machine an organizer should read the english dictionary an organizer is one that organizes not one the disorganizer and deletes my e mail apart from that this thing would not run any of the games i downloaded from it and it also kept losing all of the memos and stuff i put on it maybe if the makers would have made a more stable os i would have been able to recommend this product

11;71;2;0.4537975356806497;this was one of palm s real groundbreaking handhelds with it s sleek case and low weight still a great handheld but only has 2 mb of memory and lacks the sd slot that the new palms are being manufactured with if you just need a calendar and address book this will do it but the m100 will do just about the same with albeit a much smaller screen the backlight on the palm v is woeful like the backlights on all palms but is not needed too often

0;95;94;0.9053645896024504;i have had the portable scanner for several years i use it to scan all my receipts for personal use i also use quicken the original software proprietary system of filing was ok but not great i was able to use it to handle all of my receipts 5 10 a day the software recognition at that time was not great requiring me to edit all of my receipts but i learned how to use it n nupgrading to the 5 0 the software filing system that now comes with the scanner has been more frustrating than any other software experience other than quicken s biyearly extortion this takes the cake with quicken you begrudgingly pay the fee because in the end the program still works and even with all the problems and the fact that it is not perfect you always know you can get by with it n nnow the scanner with the new 5 0 software seems to do a much better job of recognizing the information on the receipt and getting it correct however the filing system and program is far from intuitive requiring a significant amount of time reviewing the instructions even then again it is not intuitive and also it is cumbersomely slow n nif you have 100 receipts in a folder you can count on the program taking over 20 seconds to load this means that switching between folders is time consuming and frustrating accidentally clicking a folder with 2 300 receipts will have your blood pressure up and your anger at a maximum as there is nothing you can do until the computer loads the entire folder each folder is loaded as you click on it again and again so if you go from one folder to another you must wait each time n nit is a great concept but the software based on my use and based on my readings of what professional software developers have to say on the internet is nearly worthless unless you are only storing a few receipts a month n ni wanted this program to easily search through years of receipts in order for me not to have to go through hundreds of receipts by hand in multiple shoe boxes of receipts when i need a receipt for a return i wanted to search it on the computer and find where it is to make getting the original easier just having the receipts on the computer does not help as most stores will not accept a printed copy of the receipt for on line purchaces and warranty it is useful if transmitting a copy of the receipt will work however i find most still want you to mail the original this means you still must have a hard copy in a filing cabinet and an antiquated filing system to parallel this computerized version still the concept and how i used it worked pretty good however the new software makes the supposedly easy time saving task a herculean effort after spending all the money on the product and years of use i find that a good file cabinet with folders works much better and easier than the new 5 0 upgrade or rather what is currently being sold n nhere is what i want to be able to do with the system i want to double click on the icon and have the program boot immediately i want to take the receipts from my wallet and scan them quickly into the scanner i then want to review my receipts from an un reviewed folder and migrate them into the proper folders this was the way the older program worked i want to switch back and forth from folder to folder and have the folder already loaded and available like the old program or quicken so i do n t have to wait for each folder to load each time i do n t want to have to limit my folder sizes because the program takes too long to load a folder with more than 10 receipts these are the things i want from a system but sadly the new 5 0 upgrade and program that is sold with the scanners today does not deliver n nas a stand alone portable scanner it has given me years of trouble free use so far i really have nothing bad to say about the actual physical tool i appreciate the improvements in receipt recognition with the 5 0 upgrade as it is rather good however the program is just not intuitive it is not easy and it is frustratingly slow and cumbersome to the point of annoyance n nthe one star rating may not be totally accurate as there are good things to say about this but in the end the negatives make this nearly unusable as an efficient way to digitally file receipts and i could not in good conscience get someone to invest the time and effort into a new filing system that does not make their filing easier you still need hard copies of receipts for just about everything but the irs the old physical filing cabinet and folders worked great for probably over 100 years and being you still need it i cant say the effort of digitizing the receipts with this system is worth your time and effort the way it currently stands
1;56;55;0.9018197492102233;i rarely write reviews but this unit does not do what it says it does and i d like to save another potential buyer from going through what i did if all you want to do is scan and organize papers i think that this unit would be fabulous once you get it installed and start using it this is not a quick or easy task however if your goal is to export i would not buy this unit since that is my purpose i m returning it n ni bought this with the intent of scanning charge receipts from my business and exporting them into quickbooks the box and information say that neat will do this i hate this task and i thought the money would be well worth the time savings n ninstallation the box comes with version 4 of the software however version 5 is out so you are directed to the internet to obtain it as prior problems have supposedly been fixed their website is slow freezes and often links you to a non functioning page after multiple tries i was able to download the software it directs you to disable any internet firewalls or anti virus software seems easy but firefox did n t have a pull down menu for this had to go to help and finally found out how to do this the time required for this was my ignorance and not neat s however the same might be true of others as well n nusual policy to close all other programs during installation of a new program was followed finally ready to install and it freezes and crashes my computer windows xp and my wireless mouse multiple times i had to endure many restarts of my computer most had to be without proper shutdown and by using the on off switch on my computer and unplugging and plugging the usb connection to the computer for the wireless mouse three hours later it finally installed n nstarting i m pretty intuitive and usually start using a program and exploring menus without a problem however menus are not intuitive until you read the directions again this is more time invested once reading the directions i have to admit it was no problem using the machine but it was cumbersome the first thing is that although the scanning is pretty quick it takes a while for the software to convert the data into a viewable receipt perhaps the best thing is to scan in a bunch of receipts then go do something else while it works and come back later i wanted to see if it exported properly before i invested a lot of time scanning if you do have to go away and do something else while it is processing the scans it takes away from the time saving purpose of using neat n nthe next problem is each time you export a receipt you have to drill down to tell neat where you want it to export this involves many clicks from my computer all users shared documents documents and settings shared documents quickbooks company etc you ca n t set any or preferable locations then you have to choose the account from neat software to the account in qb s each time takes a lot of time batching the exports is definitely the way to go to make things efficient but still not as much of a time saver as i thought it would be especially when you have to keep selecting the accounts in qb s n npractical use this is where the neat fails miserably i have an account in quickbooks where all the charge receipts go they are listed with the vendor date purchased and the account that they go into e g office supplies hardware software etc when neat exports them it exports them as bills to pay so are under accounts payable and not in the charge register under the account that i selected to get that information you have to then go to accounts payable therefore it is an extra step to go to accounts payable to see the detail to make sure it was correct as well as to look at it for analysis on another occasion although that s not the way i record i qb s i could live with that if it meant that i did n t have to enter all those receipts another problem was that it would n t export credit card refunds it said it would not import because the amount was under 10 it seems absurd not to be able to export credits i did n t try to import and charges under 10 so i do n t know what it would do there n nhowever the final thing that killed the deal was that the exported items all come in with the date exported and not the date of purchase i tried several different things checked online forums help but there was n t anything about correcting this there is no live help help and customer service are only available by email i got an email back that says they will get to me when they can given that i went through all the menus help info and user forums my conclusion was that there appears to be no fix for that if i have to go into each receipt to fix the date i might as well just enter them n nconclusion the problems using this to export to quickbooks make is such that it just does n t do the job there are multiple steps to define the program to export to each time define the account to go to each time then go to accounts payable to view the details of the export and then to change the date on the transaction in addition you have to enter any refunds or credits manually and not through neat as it wo n t export them this kills the whole idea to create efficiency and save time
2;53;52;0.8972535823814216;i inserted the cd and got an error that the external program can not be run ok so i opened windows explorer and double clicked on the setup file it started up and i had the option to click a button to get the latest version off the web the browser opens and i get another error can not process your request at this time great n nwell i manually navigated the website downloaded the software and started the installer the first thing i get is a warning saying the recommended screen resolution to run neatworks is 1024 x 768 after installing please modify your screen resolution to get full screen capabilities of the application really 1024 x 768 sorry neatworks but i do n t have a ten year old monitor the most common laptop screens today have horizontal resolutions of 1600 and above and the desktop i was installing on has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 i m not about to make all my other programs look enormous just to accommodate neatworks n nthe install takes a long time and various windows appear near the end a message box appears that says installing neat adf scanner 2008 driver 2008 is n t that three years ago i thought i had bought the latest version of this scanner anyway the rest of the install went fine when i started the software it did say copyright 2010 so it appears to be only one year old n nof course when i started it again it complained that it wants 1024 x 768 screen resolution and warned me that my resolution was lower than this even though my resolution is 1920 x 1080 no matter it does n t seem to affect anything n nwhen you first run the software it plays a tutorial video which is helpful and not too long i recommend watching it n nanyway i scanned some test receipts and they scanned in fine you do have to press the scan button on the scanner for each scan it would be nice if it would just keep scanning as you feed in more receipts but the big problem was that i could n t find the image files after the scans were complete after some digging around on their website i discovered the horrible news there are no image files n nthat s right this scanner does n t save the scanned images as image files on your hard drive here i was thinking that s what scanners are supposed to do but this one does n t it seems this scanner is integrated with the document management system i e the software that comes on the cd scans are imported and stored inside a database that s part of this software but they re not available to you on your hard drive i even searched my entire c drive to see if there was some temporary folder where i could find these images unfortunately they were nowhere to be found n nmore digging on their website and i found out that the only way to get image files is to select the image in their software program neatworks and choose save current visible image as unfortunately you have to do this one by one yes there s no way to just export all your scanned receipts as image files you can multi select receipts that have n t been filed yet and export them to pdf but they get saved as a single giant multi page pdf file n nso if you want a very expensive scanner that stores all of your data in a proprietary database format and is completely useless as a normal scanner go ahead and drop 180 on this product as for me i m taking advantage of the amazon guarantee and returning it n nps the software uses an activation key and only allows you to install it on two computers this is completely unrealistic for any small business that needs to share the scanner it s portable after all among several employees if you want to spend 180 and buy a separate scanner for every two computers you have then this one s for you
3;115;114;0.8883682748511916;i have used the portable scanner for about 2 years it scans reliably i can scan one document right after another without getting jammed up nthe software pulls the document in evaluates whether it s a receipt document or business card this works fairly well many larger receipts are judged to be documents but they can easily be dragged and dropped into the receipt column n nthough the process takes a long time backups are fairly easy to do the software is unusable during the time the backups are being made the backups can lock up my newer and fairly powerfull pc but it s temporary n nthe receipt ocr is fairly good it does make a lot of mistakes but i m sometimes amazed that it s found the right date or total amount then sometimes it makes a weird mistake like 5468 when the total is 45 i ve accepted the fact that i have to make corrections to each receipt it also remembers receipt names and if you ve put a name in previously and have to correct another receipt just putting the first few letters in the name line will bring the entire name up n nwhy they did n t use this same technology for the name line in the document section is a mystery i have to enter the full name in most of my documents whether or not i ve entered the name in the system before n nthe file organization in this software is also a mystery the company touts the software for organizing your receipts and documents and offers lots of training however i have found no training explaining their filing system it is simply a puzzle to me i assume that the company believes that everyone will simply figure it out on their own n ni have figured it out for myself but my system does n t work well the company s instructions are of no help the system seems to rely too much on memory of which mine is deteriorating n nwhen i put in a new receipt or document i have to find a folder to put it in the folders ca n t be nested like all good folders on all other computer programs are i click to select the folder and a small screen what s with these small screens comes up showing only the first 6 folders i ve created i can click to make it full page or i can scroll through the small screen so i am presented with a page full of folders and have to search the entire page to find the folder to put the document in well if i d organized my folders better i could find it easier so i reorganized my folders another time consuming exercise it s like a huge puzzle and i m not so good with that kind of puzzle i did improve it but still find like minded receipts and documents filed in different places and it still takes a long time to file a new receipt or document n nwhen filing a new receipt or document what s with that tiny review screen i ca n t read a thing on it so need to enlarge the document in the screen but the window wo n t enlarge to full size like most windows do i have to click click click on the plus sign for the document to enlarge then i have to scroll to search for the date or amount when i find it sometimes i realize i need to enlarge it further when i click on the plus sign again the document repositions to the top left corner and i have to start all over in my search n nthis company advertises that they will help me organize my life i agree that they do but they certainly make me organized in a disorganized way please neat can you focus on making my job of inputting and retrieving data quick and easy i know it s not that easy for you to do but that s the point you re supposed to do the hard work so that it s easier for us that s what we pay you for n nnow you want me to upgrade to neat 5 but i do n t know if i can trust you i would do it if i could keep my 4 software unmolested so that i can be assured my data is safe the horror stories i ve been reading do n t give me enough confidence in your ability to make my life easier
4;76;75;0.8487085022566904;smart tip for all users download the software from neat s site and install you re sure to get the latest version that way when you install you ll be prompted to sign up for a 30 day trial of neatcloud which sounds fine but once i saw the monthly price i d be charged i opted not to go further this cloud option is really for the extreme neat freaks those of you who live for organizing and would get a thrill from accessing your receipts anytime anywhere including on your mobile devices i m not one of those people there is of course something to be said for keeping your receipts safely stored off your computer but at the price of a deluxe fast food meal every month it seems a bit costly that said using the scanner to take care of my messy habits is all i need and i can back up neat s documents to my time machine and dropbox n nit s as simple as can be start up neat s software feed a receipt into the long slit of the scanner and press scan neat takes care of the rest including reading as much of the receipt s contents as possible it was generally able to pick up most clean clear text but had trouble on any receipts that printed even the slightest bit blurry that s easy enough to fix just click in the box select the text and retype the amount n nfrom there neat lets you organize the receipts into folders that you can set up for your needs pretty much just like you would in the finder as a mac user i would assume it s similar for windows users there are also smart folders but i have n t quite worked out how they function the software itself is noticeably scant on details about how these work or how to make custom ones n none strange note for mac users i ca n t for the life of me figure out why the neat software wants needs access to contacts in my address book weird perhaps i can send my receipts to them n nwhat s also nice is the unit is tiny and comes with a soft sleeve in which to store it so it can be neatly stored out of the way all in all it s a pretty thoughtful system that i will be putting to much greater use to get much more organized in the future
5;94;93;0.8347085658142018;we have three of these and i use them on nearly a daily basis to file almost everything from receipts to copies of important papers the database software is easy to use and provides a backup functionality that every user should take advantage of on a regular basis i have needed to run restores a few times when my pc died in the middle of a session and the database ended up in an unusable state n nmy biggest gripe is with the absolutely abysmal customer support provided by this product one of my scanners has a fault each and every time i have reached out to them i get back the same link to the same web page telling me how to clean the scanner even if i mention in the ticket that i already cleaned the scanner the warranty for the scanner is not worth the paper it is written on or the electrons you scanned it into and many of the so called service plans you get from vendors like staples insist that you exercise the manufacturer warranty first n ni like the product if neat ever resolves my tickets with the broken scanner i will happily upgrade my review to four stars but since they do n t honor their warranties they get two
6;16;15;0.7926452893699095;never ever ever use this product the software is poorly designed and extremely buggy it worked slowly for a little while then suddenly just stopped let me explain the basic setup n nthe way the neat software is designed is that you have the neat desktop program that you open and run you scan receipts into and can edit the information then you have to sync it with neat cloud which is basically an online mirror of the desktop software then from the neat cloud you can send those receipts to quickbooks now once you send the files to quickbooks they are locked on neat cloud you can never edit them or unlock them not even digging around through menus it s designed so that you do n t have that option i understand making it difficult for users to accidentally duplicate data that has already been sent but forbidding your users from editing their own data completely n nthis is where the funny part comes in after having entered a thousand or so documents it suddenly would n t sync with the neat cloud every time i tried it would prompt do you want to turn on sync then ask me to sign in i entered my password and hit save the box goes away but nothing changes if i try to sync it just prompts me to sign in again well i still had about 105 documents on the neat cloud i had n t sent to quickbooks so i thought i would send those over i selected all but one of the first page so 99 items and hit send nothing happened it just sat there with the page dimmed i refreshed it after about 10 minutes sometimes the page just sticks and upon refresh the files are sent locked and the files were n t locked so it had n t gone through i tried it once more same result i selected just two files and sent them 2 5 minutes later i get the your files have been sent confirmation finally it worked i up it to 4 files and try to send it nothing after 10 minutes refresh and they are n t locked i do a quick check of quickbooks and low and behold neat cloud sent my receipts several times so much for preventing duplicates now i have to comb through 450 receipts looking for 100 duplicates to manually delete each once n nand the desktop still wo n t sync with neat cloud n ni struggled initially setting this up as it is not very intuitive but blamed any issues on there being a learning curve now i wish i had never purchased this and wasted so many hours on it n nupdate so the syncing problem was fixed by paying to upgrade to the premium neat cloud service 14 99 per month glad to know that if i want to continue using this scanner to work with quickbooks online i have to pay a monthly fee the locking problem however has not gone away it sent 43 items to quickbooks but did not lock those items on neat cloud additionally for negative amounts credits it showed those files as locked as if it accounted for them in quickbooks now i ca n t send them to quickbooks i get an error saying it ca n t be less than 0 that s good to know because apparently all along it locked those files but never actually sent them and it did n t tell me that n nat this point i m not sure whether i want to get my money back or have the satisfaction of smashing this piece of junk with a baseball bat

8;20;19;0.7419765468009385;i have been using neatreciepts for 4 years now and have been pretty happy with the product version 2 and 3 were not difficult to install setup and use i had no major problems then i decided to upgrade big mistake the version 4 x software is not compatible with earlier versions of the software they provided a migration utility that will not work without the previous versions database installed guess what you have to uninstall the previous version to install the migration utility all of your old data will either be gone or you need 2 computers 1 running version 2 3 and the other running version 4 you can not call technical support you must email them the email response is about 3 4 days and every time i email them their response is to try again with the uninstall and reinstall wtf ok so i do and guess what it still will not work so i have to wait another 3 4 days for them to tell me to try again and make sure i disable my antivirus guess what i did but now i have to wait another 3 4 days i think there support email system is just canned responses from a bot the cost of this product should be 29 99 since there is no technical support clearly this company is not interested in keeping old customers i used to endorse the product version 3 to my colleagues now i have changed my tune i am telling every person at every conference and business meeting i attend stay clear of neatco and neatworks paperport can do most of what neatworks can and is much less hassle if you are already a customer do not under any circumstance upgrade unless you do n t care about any historical data let s all vote with our do n t send any to neatco you will be sorry
9;25;24;0.735024744835807;i purchased mine at costco good choice since i m going to return it as soon as i can nthe actual scanner is small and comes with a nice travel case and a usb cable that s all you need nhere s the issues i ve had with this scanner nthe usb connections is totally flaky could be a bad cable but this is the first time i ve had issues with a usb device nthe feeding mechanism is bad it s supposed to grab the paper but it does n t work with small receipts and as it scans it bends most of the scans nit has drivers twain and others you could use with other utilities but there s no utility to change settings so you re stuck with basic 200dpi and b w so faded receipts will not scan nalong those lines the ocr software works ok but i ve had problems with dot matrix printed receipts they scan as blank pages and there s nothing that i can do about it nthe quick scan utility stopped showing the previews of scans it does still count them and load to neatworks nthe software itself seems logically organized and helpfull but i found it to be highly frustrating and difficult to customize it s designed to make things easy for you and it uses it s own database to store your scans i m used to saving my scans as pdfs it does do pdfs and tiffs and although it does batch scans if one receipt will not scan blank page you re screwed you really have to try to work around the software which is not easy noverall i just need a portable scanner with a driver utility that s it this thing does more than that which would be ok but you re pretty much stuck using it with it s own software and i do n t have the time or interest to learn

11;9;8;0.6650812780351959;i received an advance release of this product at wwdc08 in june 2008 and i ve been playing with it ever since it is top notch in every regard the hardware is small and only uses the usb port no need to find an a c plug the software is even better as it grabs data right from the scanned receipt no need for retyping in most cases n nthis is a high quality product and feels like something apple has made as even the packaging is tidy and well organized n ni highly recommend this over the currently offered shareware solutions the software is really top notch and the scanner is portable enough to fit in a laptop bag easily
12;32;31;0.6530025359449818;neat has done a good job of packaging and marketing their products but poor product performance and lack of software support make them a poor choice for a scanner solution n nthe hardware is reasonably well designed but their software specifically the capabilities and accuracy of their ocr is very weak compounding the problem is a business model that requires you to keep buying new versions of their software they do not release updates to fix the problems they call each fix a new release and require you to buy it n nmy recommendation is to look elsewhere or wait for version 10 0 they are on 4 0 now perhaps by then it will be a good product

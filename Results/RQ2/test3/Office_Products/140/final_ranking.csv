0;19;29;0.8269555230743024;i am very new to coloring and using colored pencils i was actually eyeing the prismacolor premier set and ran across these during my search the thought of using these as pencils and then with a wet brush was appealing i did have to practice using these and watched several youtube videos on using these properly and to their best advantage i was a little worried at first because i was n t getting the effect i wanted but with a little practice i now have a better feel for them i absolutely love these pencils after coloring with them as pencils you add a lightly damp brush over the color and you get this amazingly intense rich color you have to be careful not to use too much water as it takes just a damp brush to get the effect i have also used these by just rubbing a damp brush on the tip and painting on my page these are great and i love using them n ni almost took a star off because the set i got did have a duplicate pencil which meant i was missing one but after using these i figured i would just go buy the missing pencil and keep the 5 star rating because i think these are amazing n nthe attached picture was colored using these pencils and the prismacolor premiers the trees land and sky were all done with the inktense pencils i tried to create the same type of tree with prismacolors but could n t so i really was excited to be able to do it with these of course there are several artists out there that could create it with regular pencils but sadly i am not an artist just a mom who wanted to color with her daughter and use come really cool tools
1;22;41;0.8258673461769895;i bought these as an alternative to watercolor pencils my first impression was that they were really creamy for this type of pencil they were also highly pigmented and super vibrant n ni then swatched all of them out and realized that one of them is actually an outliner pencil so really you only get 23 colors n ni did some opacity testing with them as well on the top i colored full strength and did not set the pencil on the bottom it is the pencil full strength with water on top the bottom swatch started out the same size as the top so you can see that they move around really well after water is applied to the pencil n ni also did some permanency testing i took some paint directly off the pencil lead with my brush and let it dry i then took a wet brush to it and tried to move the color around the teal and fuchsia did well the tangerine and the sun yellow moved around a bit but not nearly as much as the prismacolor watercolor pencils i use n nthe only reason i docked a star is because of the included outliner pencil i do n t really outline and if i do i use other pens the price is also a little high amazon is the cheapest place i have found them even compared to using a coupon at the big box craft stores
2;40;128;0.81787318354061;the art rebel that i am i wanted to try something more exciting than regular colored pencils i draw a lot of faces and combine different mediums like watercolor and a layer of pastels and add fine details with pencil i was very happy to see that these derwent pencils which are really a form of ink blended in so well with the watercolor i was doing and after it was dry stayed in place even when the paper was wet i also found that i can take a wet brush rub it against the pencil tip and get instant wash to apply to my painting i just love this product derwent is of superior quality and well worth the money if you buy it here on amazon its a lot cheaper than in the art store while the inktense have a deeper more intense color it can be lightned by adding the color with a brush or just buy a set of derwent graphite pencils they are much lighter and good for a lighter wash
3;88;86;0.7917035260501127;i really like this set as it introduces me to water colors i am glad i purchased the 72 count as the variety of shades is fantastic the results look so professional and you would not know whether this was a pencil or mixed color in a palate there is however technique involved with these pencils i have learned to very lightly lay down the color and to layer to produce depth instead of leaning heavy on the paper i use a canson 140lb paper and find the combination works great these pencils sharpen well i am very happy with this product
4;46;57;0.7861945714308892;i like the pencils but i found that these pencils you have to wet them first to get the colors to come out they are not like any other pencils i worked with i really love a charchol pencil that is number 6 b soft and comes out where i can see my work in but with this product i find that this can not be seen that well as far as the sharpening them be careful you do not sharpen too much you will lose most of the color they do work well when its not so pointy i do also love the intense blocks when wet your colors come out amazing i use it mostly on silk dries fast and you can heat set the iron and no steaming so you can use right away and its permananet this set and the derwent instense blocks are very good for traveling i travel alot so i need something that i do not need to use color dyes with that have easy access to do on the plane or at my destination but still have the control to play or draw whenever the mood sends me
5;16;11;0.7781904095209987;i own the inktense blocks and got these because i did n t like the idea of whittling sharp points on my blocks i thought i would n t need the whole set i would just use a few here and there when i got them i decided to use them on their own and regretted not getting the whole set for the most part they are really smooth i can lay them on the paper with the lightest touch i only had troubles with both yellows in the 36 set they were a bit stiff it could be my perception they are bright so it took quite a few layers to actually see them and when i washed over them they were intense i was able to make a large wash before i ran out of ink n nthese are defiantly intense a little bit of these go a long way i do n t think i will ever be able to use up even one i got through my first test painting without needing to sharpen any n ni have attached a test run i did with just the inktense pencils i used three colors bark a warm black has a purple look sun yellow and shiraz a cool almost alizarin red this set has a very bright orange that did n t work for this project so i mixed my own i laid yellow down first and went over it with shiraz i used a water brush to mix them on the paper and they made a nice dark orange it worked out okay but mixing on a palette with paint or the inktense blocks is more controlled option shiraz has a low tinting strength i almost accidentally washed away my orange and was stressed at the idea of a second attempt n ni do think these pencils have a slight chalky look to them i am willing to live with the chalky look it is n t that noticeable and will probably be diminished when i find the right paper i used my sketch canson xl pad which does n t bring out the best color in paint but it s nice solid paper n nhere are some tips for using these any water soluble pencil really successfully n1 use a water brush or a stiff scrubber type brush not a soft sable n2 do swatches first n3 find the low tinters and high tinters so you can get your mixes right n nthat s it and good luck
6;98;25;0.7670011194681706;got these from amazon prime day for a good deal love how intense the colors are one touch with a damp brush and the solid colors melt one thing i ve found is that it works better on paper that is n t so rough and you should n t drag the pencils on the paper with a heavy hand a light touch will do the color tends to get caught in the texture of heavy watercolor paper and it takes a bit of digging with a wet brush to get the gritty texture to smooth out for the attached swatch i had to flip my watercolor paper over to work on the smoother side even then you can see some grain left over i think these pencils will work very well with smooth watercolor friendly paper like midori traveler s notebook and hobonichi techo
7;8;32;0.761260160225638;the derwent inktense 36 pencil set arrived in perfect condition following some reviewers suggestions i immediately marked the tray with the numbers and color names of each pencil in its slot to keep them in order n nnext i made charts to show each pencils strokes in both dry and wet samples thanks for the tip mary ingold nsome pencil points do not look like the color put on paper sherbet lemon mustard and tan pencil points look green some dark pencil points such as sea blue and teal green are brilliant when wet charcoal grey and indian ink are cooler than the warmer ink black n nfor the charts i cut out pages from a pentalic hardbound sketch book since the pages were white and smooth the paper buckled however with the slightest addition of water using a pentel arts aquash water brush purchased on amazon i was careful to moisten rather than flood the pencil marks the colors spread easily and smoothly but use heavier paper than all purpose sketchbooks for your artwork n nthe black outline pencil which is not a watercolor pencil wo n t be affected by the addition of water however it can smear when coloring with other dry pencil marks around it see the ducks face in my picture in small areas it would be better to apply the color as a wash rather than a dry pencil followed by a wet brush n nwhile trying to photograph the pencils with the charts i had trouble with the round barrels causing the pencils to roll on the slightest incline of the surface finally i put them on the carpet which held them in place a small washcloth or piece of fabric could help to prevent rolling and dropping of pencils n nthese pencils offer the best of both worlds the control of drawing and painting without any mess or waste nill post my charts although the colors may not be as brilliant in the photos due to lighting
8;79;35;0.7453308481653325;i love these i got them for my daughter as a gift but i decided to give them a try myself absolutely gorgeous colors and workability they work well on primed canvas i would try them on a finer canvas for portraits though because the rougher canvas makes it difficult to detail properly making an under layer with washed acrylic would be best so that the white does not show through brush quality definitely matters too i used cheap synthetic brushes and they only smear the ink around causing the texture to appear gunky especially after adding a few layers high quality watercolor brushes would probably be a smarter choice i did a few pieces with a combination of copic markers and acrylics when using on canvas you have to be careful not to smear it around with too much water and it s best to allow each layer to dry a bit before adding another i have tried them on arches cold and hot press papers and the colors are quite vivid i am going to use them for sumi ink drawings and watercolors on the arches paper very nice product these would make an excellent gift for those who love to use colored pencils and mixed mediums
9;21;6;0.7102941813669968;warning this is an in depth review i am writing this for people who really want to know details about these pencils if you prefer a shorter summary see section marked the bottom line n ni am torn on how to rate these pencils as a watercolor pencil they are bright and intense and are nicely colored as a permanent ink pencil that stays put once it has been activated with water and dried well that is another story because that is how i purchased these i am rating them based upon that premise since that is what makes these pencils unique according to their description n nwhat is this set of pencils like nthis is the entire set of inktense pencils i have spoken with someone who knows the art field in ways few do and i was told that derwent was re formulating the inktense line of pencils i think i know why more on that later n nthis set of pencils comes in a tin box which has a nice cover on it it does snap into place but there is no hinge the inside has two rather flimsy trays where each pencil rests you have to remove the top tray to get to the pencils below mine came arranged by color which was nice there were no colors missing and no doubles either n nwhat was the quality of the pencils like ni know that there has been some question about the quality of the pencils in this listing but in my case the pencils were good quality one has a split in it but for the most part they were fine an all tips were ready to use they came shrink wrapped and in brand new condition n nhow do these pencils perform nnow here is where the problems start first of all there are many different surfaces to use watercolor media on but in this case the ink takes it to another level supposedly the box advertises that these pencils can be laid down and once laid down they can be activated with water and moved around the surface once they dry they are supposed to be permanent and not move around or muddy when you paint over them n ni have tested every single color of these pencils i have swatched them and drawn them out to a very slight wash i left them in place for a week without touching them when i went over them gently with a plain water brush not sopping just wet enough i was very disappointed to find that they smeared as badly as watercolor pencils do this was on high quality watercolor paper without a heavy layer of gelatin on it n nthis is not supposed to be the way that these work i was very disappointed as watercolor pencils these perform as expected but that is not how they are advertised as working n nhaving said that i will say that there are different surfaces that i am going to try these on i plan to use them on silk scratchboard and experiment with other porous surfaces to see how these behave on high grade watercolor paper they are not permanent once activated even if they were drawn out to a light wash that is disappointing n nstorage ni wanted to mention here that i moved these to the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href soucolor 120 slots pu leather pencil case with zipper rose red dp b01nbiacem ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 soucolor 120 slots pu leather pencil case with zipper rose red a nbsp in which they fit perfectly these pencils tend to be a bit fatter than other watercolor pencils so i wanted to point that out in case that was a concern n nwhat you should consider doing ni highly suggest that you get a watercolor paper spiral bound pad does not have to be huge to keep swatches in if you have not already these pencils look very different in lead when they are put down on paper and then when you add water to them n non this pad choose a page to put your inktense swatches on and make small rectangular swatches start from very intense to the left and then lighter to the right leave room to draw the out with water to the right n nonce you have labeled the color swatch with a technical pen permanent then you take a little water brush or water in a regular brush and draw the pencil out to the right making sure to draw it out to a very light wash let these swatches dry then when you want to use these pencils you can refer to your chart and know exactly how these will look once activated with water in various intensities n nthe bottom line nthese are advertised as being permanent once activated with water and dried so much that you can paint over them without smearing that was not my experience the colors are bright and have a distinct texture to them much brighter than many swatches online appear if used as watercolor pencils they are fine but if you are depending on them not to smear i would caution you about these i have only used them on watercolor paper of high quality which did tend to brighten the colors regular thinner mixed media paper dulled them down a bit i plan to test them on other surfaces like silk or scratchboard to see their permanence it is possible that other porous surfaces might give me better results n nmy rating nthese have three stars only based upon their failure to stay put on watercolor and mixed media paper i will test them further on silk and scratchboard and update this review should i find a difference in performance as i said at the beginning someone who is very familiar with art companies and what is going on told me that they are reformulating the inktense pencils i am not sure if the reason is the smearing as i experienced or not
10;10;19;0.6962999631456144;i am so pleased with these pencils it takes a little while to get the hang of them but once you do they are amazing the ink dries permanently and does n t go through the pages of my adult coloring books they arrived perfectly also i wish there were more greens in this set but i can buy them in open stock attached is the first picture i colored with them i followed along with a youtube video
11;120;80;0.682819760029322;these watercolor pencils performed as advertised the color is very intense they also blend beautifully with each other i have been an oil painter for over 40 years but lately i have been trying various water based media i have been disappointed with the difficulty of blending for example a sunset sky with these media i was able to use these pencils to make overlapping horizontal stripes from yellow to purple on arches hot press board i then blended them with a wet foam brush and achieved a sky that was outstanding and would rival any done in oils i intend to order more of these pencils and hope that they offer additional colors
12;81;79;0.6657302456893089;i really like these pencils but they could be improved they have very intense colors as advertised they are excellent if they have the colors you want however they lack a full range of colors they are short on the reds and pinks and generally the warm colors they do have a wonderful selection of cool and dark colors also the colors on the back end of the pencil do not match what you get when you use them on the page you have to make your own color chart or sketch them on a piece of scratch paper to see the actual color you will get they do have wonderful colors especially in the dark range they are a wonderful addition to a larger more complete set of watercolor pencils
13;36;38;0.6551545623757787;loving this beautiful coloring book for adults the cover has a slipcover both of which are able to be colored and the slipcover may be colored inside and out the pages are a very nice weight although they are printed on both sides and markers may bleed to the other side the art is amazing and beautiful and i may end up buying a second one to color differently and yet a third to keep pristine and unmarked just for the beauty of the drawings
14;42;17;0.6408606467115195;these pencils are phenomenal wonderful rich pigment when water is added i am looking forward to using them in my adult coloring books i have included a picture of all the colors in the 72 set the wide range of blues and greens are appreciated for coloring landscapes definitely a good decision to buy the 72 set
15;39;27;0.5912222052644189;wow love these very intense colors i ve used other watercolor pencils but these are the best will definitely be buying more colors i do not care for a regular paint brush with these waterbrush works best for me if you do n t know what those are i have attached a picture for tiny spaces you can wet the pencil to color in they are well worth trying
16;72;10;0.5317663575857766;i m so happy that my hubby got these for me for my birthday i started using these when i became bedridden and could n t do the metal work that i loved i taught myself how to draw instead and i ve fallen in love with these since i have always wanted the full set and losing my old smaller set when we moved gave me the opportunity to do so the price was also amazing so much cheaper than going to our local art supply store

0;120;111;0.9137873473054453;well there have already been a good number of really in depth fantastic reviews here for this printer so there s no need for me to rehash everything that has been said at the same time i just wanted to put my two cents in and add one more positive review to the list n ni ve wanted a laser printer for years i rarely ever print in color inkjets are painfully slow and the cost of cartridges for inkjets we all know it s gouging to say the least i ve also always wanted a wireless printer previously i had an old bulky hp all in one and i never had enough space anywhere within cable length it was always in the way i ended up hooking it up printing what i needed to then unhooking it and storing it in the closet until next time inconvenient to say the least n nso i know my requirements are a want it to be a laser printer and b it really would be nice if it were wireless n nup until recently laser printers were just out of my reasonable price range and the whole wireless printer trend did n t really pick up until the last year or two it seems to get the two together you were certainly not going to break the sub 100 price point on top of that at the cheaper end of things you were n t going to get a high quality printer n nthis all changed the moment i saw this one here i d had my eye on it for about half a year but it was still 150 and my clunky old printer still technically worked happened to be at a national retailer and saw they had it on sale for 99 and was excited i got on here and read the reviews and all looked good n nreceived it as a gift set it up and i am very pleased that this is not the piece of junk that i always expected would be had at this price i ll just go over some bullet points and reiterate what some of the other reviewers have pointed out in places n n1 it does have 3 interfaces usb ethernet wired and of course the gem wireless n n2 this thing is fast it can come out of power saving mode and have your page ready to go in i would estimate roughly 5 seconds n n3 it has multiple management interfaces once you get your ip address and all set you have the built in web interface like a lot of the business laser printers just go to the printer s ip address in your web browser you also have some software that is downloadable from their website called bradmin light which will do some basic maintenance configuration functions you can also get some info from the print monitor which i believe can be disabled for those who hate huge popup windows that talk and turn a simple print job into a multimedia display ehem hp what happened to the normal windows print queue n n4 as mentioned the toner cartridge that it comes with is a starter one which supposedly will do 700 pages you may want to consider putting the printer into toner save mode where it just basically does what other printers would call a draft copy just lighter lettering but perfectly fine if it s just for you to read or reference n n5 duplexing is just an added bonus it was n t something i really needed but it s a good paper saver and i have n t had any troubles with it like some have reported possibly try a heavier weight of paper maybe the paper is too thin light and when it goes to duplex it catches up somewhere also someone mentioned duplex paper curling there s actually a feature that you can enable that is supposed to prevent or reduce that n n6 i d recommend getting the latest drivers from the brother website as the latest version was only released less than a week ago it also has the ability for firmware upgrades but mine was already at the current revision out of the box n nso if you re looking for a compact wireless fast and seemingly high quality printer this is one of the best you re going to find for this price if the high yield toner is 40 something dollars that s two inkjet cartridges the high yield toner cartridge is supposed to last roughly 2 500 pages if you re not a super heavy printer that s forever i m happy with the product and i would definitely recommend it to a friend do not regret the decision at all n noh there is one important thing to know about laser printers if you have never owned one or really worked with them much their sleep and standby modes do n t use too much power but they have one crappy feature and that is the working load or how many watts they use while actually in running mode it can be as much as 500w or more depending on the size of it in my house which has crappy electrical work done it has always seemed it will actually flicker the lights in the room when it kicks into gear or when it s first powering up this can be a bit annoying because of this huge peak power usage it s not recommended to plug them up to a ups battery backup at least on the side that actually has battery surge protection it would be fine on the surge only side hooking it up to a consumer ups battery side could cause anything from it going into undervoltage warnings to premature death of battery unit from the constant high draws just a little knowledge i ve picked up working with them look in the notes specs for peak usage energy watts or something like that and it should give you a better idea but if you have a lot of stuff on the same circuit as the printer do n t be surprised if your lights do a really quick flicker when this thing goes into motion
1;42;29;0.9027656207823805;i just got my printer today it prints fantastically and is a heck of a lot faster than my epson inkjet i am a laser printer fan from here out so in reviewing the printer it s great and setup on my dell laptop was a snap n nas for interfacing with my wife s mac that s a whole different story as many have mentioned and as disclosed in the product description the included cd rom does not have driver installation for any software newer than snow leopard 10 6 anyone using lion or newer needs to go onto the brother website and fairly easily install the drivers i am runnning 10 7 5 and there was an additional software update available by just running my apple software update tool it prints fine when connected via usb to the printer n nhere s where people seem to run into issues when printing wirelessly let me be clear there is an issue with apple 10 7 printing wirelessly however it is not an issue with brother or the printer a bit of light internet research will show you that when people upgraded to lion 10 7 their wireless printing capabilities went haywire i ve seen people mention issues with every type of printer imaginable with our old epson the same issue came up when we upgraded so the blaming of brother for network issues is misguided it is an apple issue and as i write this at 2 30am i ve been trying to find an answer to the problem for the last 4 hours with no luck people have mentioned that apple seems to pass the buck when it comes to issues with this they gave up on 10 7 bug fixes a long time ago as of right now i m not sure where to go with this and it looks like it is n t going to be resolved tonight n nas a long time loyal apple fan i have to be honest that i m a bit dissapointed i have never once had an issue like this they are usually reserved on a frequent basis for my windows machines all that aside i wanted to provide a review in reponse to some of the criticism brother is receiving regarding this issue i will update my post when if i can resolve this issue n n update n nafter hours of tinkering i figured out how to fix it to start from the beginning of the install n n1 go to the brother usa com homepage and find your model n2 download the applicable drivers for your software n3 run the programs one is an installer the other is a wireless network setup there should be two other firmware programs as well n4 run your apple software update n5 install the new software for the printer n6 restart the computer n7 it should have printed already when the printer first booted but you need to have the printer ip address you can access it through your network configuration or go to the printer in preferences and it should show it there n8 write down the printer ip address n9 if you have n t already pulled up your printer in system preferences pull it up hit the button on the left hand middle side to erase your previously installed printer you re not undoing anything you just did you re just removing the old version and asking your system to recognize the new and updated version of the printer n10 now that you have erased the device click the button to add a device the printer was n t immediately recognized under the default tab at the top so i went over to ip kept the protocol as lpd and typed in the printer ip address in the address line the name populated below and i added that device n nnot sure if this is a permanant fix or if i just screwed around enough and got something to be able to print but now i can send docs from my mac just fine feel free to leave comments and i ll try to respond if you have questions i m not an it guy just someone who is too proud to let a machine beat me
2;110;59;0.8965948768449954;i have been using the brother hl 2270dw printer for a few days i am very happy with it n nthe packaging was easy to open and i was able to remove the printer from the box by myself in the past it has been a two person job one to hold the box and one to lift the printer out n nthe set up was easy and took only a few minutes the instructions are clear and well written drawings are included and accurate the on screen set up is one of the best i have seen brother has done an excellent job creating the set up instructions using this as wireless or with a cable has been trouble free n nthe ability to duplex easily could n t be any better it is easy to switch back and forth when necessary any changes needed to be made in the printer settings are very easy to do because brother has made it easy to get to the right place and the screens are well organized n ni read reviews on amazon and other websites before buying this printer and two things were brought up many times noise and paper curl n nthe noise this printer makes is not an issue to me the noise is different from other printers i have used but i do n t think it is any worse than any other printer n npaper curl is more about the paper than it is about the printer yes the printer does affect curl but some types of paper will curl more than others i worked in the printing industry for many many years and some types of paper were never a problem and other types of paper were nightmares n ni am still using the starter toner cartridge that came with the printer the prints are clean and crisp after i use the regular cartridge i bought with the printer i will review it i did note in some reviews complaints about having to change the drum and cleaning the corona wire these are parts of printers whether a printer fax copier that wear and get dirty and they need to be replaced and or cleaned from time to time n ni have looked at the user manual and troubleshooting guide both of these are very useful the manual is well organized and well written the troubleshooting guide is clear and easy to use n nmy decision to buy this printer was made partly because of the reviews and partly because of price the price for this printer is about 30 40 less on amazon than it is in the stores in my area also the toner cartridges are almost 20 less on amazon i also compared the cost of other toner cartridges for other printers i was considering and the cartridges for this printer are slightly less per page than others on a per page basis it does n t make much difference however long term it will add up considerably n ni would recommend the brother hl 2270dw to anyone needing a good but relatively inexpensive laser printer n nupdate 06 12 2012 i finally replaced the starter toner cartridge that came with the printer i do not print a lot but i do print everyday the starter cartridge lasted about 5 1 2 months for me i find that impressive replacing the cartridge was simple and the new cartridge which i ordered when i ordered the printer is working fine this is another reason to recommend this printer
3;44;27;0.8928599240737358;edited july 28 2013 to add nwell i ve googled the crap out of fixing the crooked printing issue no joy then i removed the printer s toner drum and replaced it making absolutely sure it was fully clicked in on both sides that did help fix the crooked printing some it s still not perfectly straight which i think it should be but it s passable overall and remember i ve only been using this printer for one day so far this machine works fine i ll review more as time goes on n noriginal review july 27 2013 my 2 year old canon bit it last week and since i was sick and tired of shelling out a small fortune for inkjet ink every year i figured i d check out a laser printer instead i figure we rarely used the color on the inkjet anyway and it was a big ol pita to keep the ink supply up n nafter much hemming hawing gnashing of teeth and wringing of hands as well as reading no kidding over 50 reviews on every brand of laser printer under 400 i finally decided on this one n ni went to office max to get it yes i paid a little more than if i had ordered it on amazon but i m so gun shy about printers that i wanted a store to be able to take it back to if something went horribly wrong so i paid 149 plus the extra 50 for a 3 year extended warranty because although i think extended warranties are mostly profit centers for retailers i do want some recourse if when something goes wrong in the next three years which it s likely to because all printers are seemingly built in china by four year olds using the cheapest quality components and when a squirrel farts they stop working but i digress n nwe re a mac household and without going into excruciating detail if i had wanted to run this printer using a usb directly to my laptop it would have worked immediately because it did when i tried it that way you just plug it in and it works but i did n t buy a wireless printer so i could hard wire it to my computer right so i pop the install software disc into my laptop drive and the software would n t work on my macbook pro running os10 8 4 mountain lion awesome n nsoooo i went to the brother website and tried to download the wireless setup wizard software i chose my operating system from a list clicked download and although the software worked to a point when it came to the window to choose my wifi network that i wanted to connect the printer to it would not respond nothing clickety clickety clickety click nothing i had to force quit the process and just for fun i started it over again with the exact same result so close yet so far drat n nsoooo then i call the office max essentials support phone number 877 max ctrl which comes with the 50 3 years extra warranty surely they can resolve my issue nope they cheerfully say they ca n t help me because they do n t offer service or support advice for apple machines that would have been nice to know when i was at office max but okay back to the drawing board or the draw ring board if you re a brit n nthen my sweet husband gets a flash of brilliance it occurred to him that we each run two different version of apple os my laptop runs 10 8 mt lion but his is still on lion 10 7 n nso on his laptop we go back to the brother website and download the wireless setup software for os7 5 and kablam it works like a freakin charm step by step all the way through easy peasy like a piece of cake we re able to configure the printer to get onto our home wifi network n nonce the printer has been configured to be on the network we each take our laptops and go into system settings print scan add printer and kablam there s the brother printer showing up waiting to be added to our machines just as pretty as it can be we select the printer it adds to the existing list of devices then we right click it to make it the default and call it a day n nthe whole thing took the better part of an hour however had the brother install and wireless setup software not had the mac os8 bug it would have literally taken ten minutes to get the thing configured so if you re running os8 good luck heck we probably could have borrowed someone s pc just to get the printer onto our home wifi network but thankfully the os7 software worked fine n nas for print quality it prints pretty quietly and the quality is crisp and clear but every printed sheet comes out slightly askew i have loaded and re loaded the paper into the tray but printing is still not straight and it s starting to piss me off i ll research to see if there is some print head alignment thing i can do to fix that n nalso i like that you can go into the printer preferences and set all kinds of default settings such as toner save 300dpi rather than the default 600dpi turn on or off duplex printing etc remember that on a mac to set default printer preferences you must actually be in the process of printing a document to set those settings and before you hit print you click the dropdown menu that says presets and select set current settings as default that will hold your new settings as defaults also i gave my custom settings a name just so i could be sure it was using them every time i printed n ni will update my review when i learn more about how to fix this crooked printing thing
4;4;41;0.8883645532772518;after going through another 56 set of inks on my inkjet printer i decided enough is enough i do n t need to print documents in color and i no longer print photos at home because costco and walmart are cheap and easy and better this brother laser printer was my solution n ni give the printer high marks the print quality can be set at three different levels and the two highest levels are superb also it duplex prints both sides and does a good job at that printing envelopes via the straight through path is easy and has made my label machine less useful n nas with so many tech units it s the setup that is the hassle i am a mac person sure i ve used pcs at work and when i have to but i much prefer the mac os the first indication that there was trouble was when the included setup disk refused to install the printer drivers because they were outdated there was no link to update no advice nothing so i went to the brother site and after digging around through their horrible ui i found the necessary updated drivers downloaded and installed them but that was only the start of the hassle n nthe user manual is horribly confusing to say the least when it comes to setting up the wireless networking at least to me i suggest you ignore everything in the manual regarding networking let me give you mac users some hints so you can avoid the wasted time and frustration i experienced n n update june 2015 apple s os x now includes printer drivers for most manufacturers so step 1 may not be necessary if the setup prompts you for a driver google the printer model number and you should find it quickly note after nearly 3 years i continue to receive personal thanks for this review i m grateful i could help so many people n n1 after you ve unpacked the printer installed the toner and paper and printed a test page go to the apple web site and search for brother printer drivers apple has all the latest drivers for download free n2 download and install the drivers n3 insert the cd that came with the printer and open the utilities folder do not use the start here osx icon n4 in the utilities folder click on wireless device setup wizard n5 in the next window setting up wireless click no then next n6 in the next window click checked and confirmed then next you do n t need to read the stuff in that box n7 in the next window make sure temporarily use usb cable is selected then click next n8 connect a usb cable from your computer to the printer n9 in the next window you will see the setup software searching for wireless signals in your area make sure your network is visible then select it n10 in the next window input your router s wireless access password twice as requested note if you have an apple airport do not enter the airport pw but your wireless access pw if they are the same no worries n11 unplug the usb cable to the printer n12 click through to finish and you are done n update aug 2014 nmany have commented that to make their printer work they took an additional step here it is n13 be certain the printer is on go to system prefs printers scanners if you see a brother printer in the pane it is likely the wired version setup placed there automatically during the setup process delete it then hit the button and add the wireless version setup your computer will find should you ever want to revert to a wired setup you must go through this step again with the printer connected via usb cable n nyour brother is now set up to print wirelessly and you can put it anywhere you like n nif brother would make the setup apple easy i would give this printer 5 stars it s a 5 star printer but a zero star setup experience
5;19;107;0.8835985731914745;this is an excellent little printer clear fast and hassle free n nthe installation went smoothly for attaching it to wired ethernet network i have n t tried wireless or usb so i ca n t comment there although two things were a bit ambiguous about the instructions first the matter of how it s connected to the network refers to how the printer is connected to the network never mind that your computers may be connected wirelessly to the router the printer s connection is all that matters here secondly even though you may have an infrastructure central router based network choose peer to peer as your network type n nthe software installation was a bit surprising while most manufacturers embed a pile of useless software and some rather annoying add ons like browser toolbars the brother allowed a clean and minimalist install it was quick and efficient and it worked just a solitary icon on the desktop that directs you to support if you need it n none aspect of the printer driver that is rarely touched upon in the reviews is the booklet mode i ve often wanted to print items in a reduced size format that could be carried about easily i tested the function and chose a 15 page pdf document to print i merely set the printer driver for booklet automatic and it printed perfectly all of the pages in order ready to fold and staple this is normally something you have to fiddle around with in a word processor to achieve for better or worse the driver reverts to single page printing upon completion i like that i do n t want to send a stack of invoices to the printer and have them inadvertently printed as a booklet n nanother nice feature that s been overlooked is that the printed pages are delivered to the tray face down in other words in order no more sorting them or having to print in reverse order as is the case with ink jet printers n nthe thing is blazingly fast typically done with a job before i reach for it print quality is very good ninety percent of my work is in monochrome or could be so by having a dedicated black and white printer will save me a great deal of supplies most color printer drivers do n t give you an option of using the black only i m sure everyone has experienced printing a flashy web page with a color ink jet printer and have the pages come out laden with ink and noticeably damp from printing all of the useless advertising and background colors even more maddening it now refuses to print a black and white document claiming the yellow has run out with this monochrome printer you do n t have to worry about it n na number of reviews have commented on it s power consumption first there s the allegation that it s draws so much power that the lights dim in the house the problem here is that your building needs to have it s wiring upgraded in any case the printer should n t be plugged into a circuit that also supplies room lighting n nnext there have been comments that it s not really energy saver seemingly because the power led remains on in dimmed mode when it s sleeping in fact in only uses 0 9 watt when it sleeping 2 8 watts with wan on that s a lot less most modern appliances such as tv s or microwaves far less than a high speed modem or router it needs to consume some power in order to keep it s connection to the network on standby you can change the status of the power indicator to off when sleeping in the software if it makes you feel better but why bother you can save a lot more energy by vacuum cleaning the coils beneath and behind your refrigerator i know you have n t done that lately n nfinally it s been stated that it draws 1 000 watts while printing well inrush perhaps but let s do the math based on the 1 000 watts in most cases 1 000 watts for an hour s time would cost you about ten cents ignoring the time you d spend reloading it with paper and at 25 pages a minute your cost in energy would be 0 00666 cents per page 0 0000666 pretty cheap all things considered n nit does exhibit a slight curling of the paper particularly when using the duplex mode i switched to 24 lb laser paper to combat this and noticed an improvement in print quality as well there is an option in the printer s software that supposedly will reduce paper curl i have n t tried it because i feel that the manufacturer would not have the default set to off unless there are performance issues associated with it s being on n noverall i m very pleased with this printer for what it s designed for a soho environment it ca n t be beat
6;5;117;0.8794709010757278;this is a nice compact laser printer with good build quality n nwireless was essential for me i ve been waiting quite a while for a wireless laser that had reliably great reviews i unpacked the box removed the plastic strips scanned the quick start guide plugged the printer in and everything was great so far i then downloaded the newest drivers from the brother website drivers on included cd s are usually 3 12 month old for my windows 7 x64 and windows 7 x32 laptops executing the driver programs walks you through setup in the past for wireless products i ve found you usually have to first set them up on a wired ethernet or usb connection then change things over to wireless i decided to test the technological development level and go straight to wireless setup starting with the 64 bit machine this consisted of inserting the tip of a pen you could also use a paperclip etc into the wireless setup button hole telling the printer to start looking for a router then i ran downstairs pushed held the wps button on my wireless router telling it to start looking for another device in one minute they met and fell in love that was it the driver installation software on the wireless 64 bit laptop detected they had a successful partnership and moved on to the final screens windows 7 had installed the printer with all of the advanced menus and controls i then installed the driver on the 32 bit laptop and it auto detected the successful partnership without touching any hardware very simple install and wireless printing was ready to go n ni never bit with the wireless inkjet offerings as the long term operating costs of inkjets are crazy i ve been refilling the toner cartridges on laser printers for years running them for so cheap it s amazing if this unit just had laser printing and reliable wireless it would be a fantastic deal however it has many features which are totally surprising this review is already too long so i ll just say that the auto duplexing is great what is even cooler is the booklet feature i m holding in my hand a 20 page pdf that i selected booklet in the options while printing it printed on both sides of the paper reduced the pages to half sheets arranged the pages in the precise complicated order and output tiny stack of five sheets from 20 i folded the stack in half and viola a perfect booklet that is more convenient to travel with and uses one quarter of the paper i m not sure you can know how cool this is until you actually have a booklet in your hand so buy this machine now and see for yourself n none final caution the supplier i normally order bulk toner from does not yet have the formulation for this printer i m sure they will in time but for now you might actually have to buy the tn450 replacement cartridge which runs at roughly 2 2 cents per page once the 700 page starter cartridge is exhausted n ni ve only had this printer for a few days so hopefully it lives up to my current expectations and retains its 5 star rating to be honest these things are going for less than a hundred on sale coupon at office supply stores and at that price point just straight laser printing with wireless is a great deal

9;14;4;0.7784816152265231;i bought this from a retail officedepot outlet officedepot and officemax are the only websites that seem to carry this printer at the moment and only officedepot would actually let me order it and it turned out my local officedepot store actually had exactly one of these in stock which i promptly purchased n nwhy it s perfect for what i needed n n wireless to eliminate cable clutter enable locating it in the most convenient spot and enable printing from my girlfriend s laptop from anywhere in the house n n it s a laser printer so it prints faster and cheaper than an inkjet of course there s no color but if we need that that s what a specialized graphics photo printer is for this is just for text and things that do n t require color or extremely detailed graphics which is 99 9 of what i print the text and graphics are perfectly crisp though do n t get me wrong n n it s got auto duplexing so you do n t waste half the blank back side of your paper when you do n t need to and do n t have to waste time manually flipping the paper with printers that only do manual duplexing saves space time and money n n easy to set up via the included cd assuming you re not totally clue less with computers you ll need a usb cable to go between your computer and the printer or an ethernet cable to go between your router and the printer to set up the wireless for the first time no there s no lcd screen or any way to set it up without your computer but you ca n t expect things like that in this price bracket n n it s cheap only printer in the 150 price range i could find that s laser with wireless and auto duplexing n nthe only reasons i docked one star from the rating n n no third party toner is available yet brother made new toner cartridges for these 2200 series models and finding even that toner is tough so there s no ultra cheap third party toner available yet that i can find but even with the brother toner cartridges it runs about 3 5 cents per page with the regular cartridge or about 2 5 cents if you get the high yield still pretty good n n officedepot is the only place you can seem to find this printer anywhere at the moment i dunno if they got it early if this model is delayed or discontinued before it s even really come out and i m a bit afraid i ll end up having a printer i ca n t find toner service for at all n nbut assuming i m supposed to have it this is the perfect home home office small business laser printer highly recommended once you can actually find it
10;10;12;0.7183744120725275;my wife and i homeschool our children and we print a lot we wanted something that was b w could duplex print front and back was wireless and was fast we have an old hp laserjet 4 that was n t wireless was heavy big and did n t duplex plus the front rollers were having issues and would cause paper jams it was time for something new n nthis model fit the bill and the refurb price fit my wallet we ve had it for about a month now and its been great setup was n t bad but the web gui is not super intuitive and looks like minimal effort went into the design i d have given it 5 stars if that was better still setup did n t take too long and once it was on the network and the print server was running i was off i was even able to set it up to work with my synology nas to work as a remote print server we re super happy so far print speed is good even with duplex its a little noisy but what printer is n t wakes and warms up quickly and i love the flexibility of the wireless i plan to go the cheap route with replacement toner vs a whole cartridge when the time comes if i remember i ll update my review to let you know how that goes
11;23;3;0.7049278132135363;i bought this from the local staples because it was in stock and the same price but it s a royal pain in the butt to set up for wireless i highly recommend the usb option and once it was set up the duplexer mangled 4 out of every 5 sheets the main reason i got this printer was because of the built in duplexer and so this was really disappointing i am going to return it to staples and perhaps get another one to see if the duplexer was a one time issue but now i m worried that the duplexer will crap out after my return period ends which would annoy me no end

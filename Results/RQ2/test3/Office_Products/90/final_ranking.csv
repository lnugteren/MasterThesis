0;37;49;0.8320431182363415;i have been a quicken user since 1997 although my 2012 version worked fine i decided to upgrade in spite of the reviews because i would n t be using the new features big mistake since i now have problems with bank account register entry reconciliation and mutual fund share price update the file conversion appears to have been done correctly in the register i added a tag to rmds that i had previously entered after answering the ira year question 2014 my ending balance for the mutual fund decreased by the total of my rmds for the year i have previously added tags and this did n t happen i could n t figure out how to correct this but recovered by restoring a backup i received my bank statement and went to reconciliation during reconciliation i saw that the account difference total did not change as i cleared items i discovered that if you do cancel or finish later and go back into reconciliation the correct difference is shown and will work going forward another irritation although minor is changing mutual fund share prices in 2012 the up and down arrows would highlight the entry so you could type over it instead of deleting the entry now it is hit and miss these are very basic functions that no longer work as they used to the product makes me very uneasy about what i have n t discovered yet and does n t inspire much confidence i worked in the computer field for 47 years and would have been ashamed to have my name associated with a product of this quality while checking several faqs regarding problems i discovered what sums up the product quality and should be the new product name sorry check the faqs to see what i mean i will most likely pursue a refund shortly n nupdate nmore bad news and some good news when you do a search in the bank register you must clear the search field to be able to see your register properly again i printed the register later preparation for reinstall of 2012 and found payments from positive 229 million to negative 145 million and for some reason most of the amounts were 32 00 and 82 00 now i have to go to my checkbook to recover my 2012 data two pieces of good news one is for people foolish enough to still want it quicken dropped their price by 30 hmm wonder why the other is that i found my 2012 installation cd hello refund
1;21;41;0.8192936342390457;i purchased quicken deluxe 2015 for windows from amazon i run windows 7 i upgraded from quicken deluxe 2014 i stuck with the deluxe version because i do not use mobile options neither do i use any of the advanced investment tracking features at one time i was a premier user but found it labor intensive to maintain and not very helpful i have other investment services that provide an x ray function so i did not think that this added feature was worth the effort cost or risk increasing the features i currently use n nmy install of quicken deluxe 2015 went well all of my quicken 2014 account data was converted successfully registers seem to be fine my monthly reminders are still intact my existing password vault still works fine i do not use the quicken password budget data looks fine debt pay down still intact investment data seems ok a reconciliation of one account actually corrected an account balance problem that i was having with quicken 2014 one step update worked so far so good n nmy usage background history ni believe i am one of the original quicken users and have stuck with the product through the years i stay with quicken because it best suits my needs during this time i have had some significant problems in quicken upgrades since i try to upgrade every year i have learned to delay the upgrades until the initial onslaught of errors are found and hopefully corrected obviously some upgrades have been extremely painful others easy and error free when i read the horror stories on the review sites i always try to consider what version the user is upgrading from the features they have had issues with and the hardware they use before i make the purchase n nway back i specifically chose my bank because it had quicken compatible checking accounts use of quicken is the centerpiece of my financial management and i needed a bank that supported that i appreciate all of the online bill pay services and access to financial institution data that quicken gives me there are only a few places that quicken does not connect to but even then they sometimes have the transaction download format that loads into quicken n nmy hope is that intuit will provide as much loyalty to its customers as we have towards their products
2;27;16;0.8133713071513978;this will probably be a lot longer than any of my past reviews but i want to make sure that others do n t have as bad an experience as i did i have been a quicken on a pc since quicken 99 i used it for more than 5 years before that on a mac so i am not unfamiliar with the product i almost upgraded from my trusty quicken 2012 day before yesterday when i purchased turbo tax deluxe 2014 but the bundle was n t available when purchasing a pc download which i prefer i purchased it yesterday when i received an ominous email from intuit telling me that my automatic download functions would cease to function at the end of april luckily the pc download version from amazon was as good a deal when coupled with turbo tax download as the intuit good deal n nbacked up my data files to another hard drive before starting and then executed the upgrade program actually things seemed to go pretty smoothly at first the only problems i had were a slightly irritating second password associated with quicken i had never encountered before but at the very end of the install i was pleased to see that the program recognized that i had a separate password associated with the password vault that was different from the password associated with my quicken id i opted to use that password associated with the quicken id for both and finished up so far so good n ni started quicken up and proceeded to browse the new product and compare what i was seeing with what i was used to seeing given that intuit had almost three years to fiddle with quicken i was really surprised how little had changed the only real issue that i had was the removal of the 2012 check box that allowed you to remove any particular account from the net worth calculation i found the separate category performed this function an it seemed to do what i wanted i also disliked the fact that the hidden account are n t really hidden but tucked under an necessary drop down window but again tolerable n nthe next morning found me using my new quicken for the first time with my daily budgeting process step one was to download all new transactions to my computer at this point things got nasty when i started the automatic update the window popped up for the intuit id password as i had expected unfortunately when i put in the password the operation failed even though i knew the password was correct just for grins i entered my password vault password but that failed also i tried signing onto quicken with the quicken id and same password and it worked perfectly time to call tech support i went to the quicken help page and after putting in my symptoms i got hooked up via live chat n nthe young lady on the chat line was very bright and quite knowledgeable about quicken the first thing she did was do a verify on my data file to make sure it was n t corrupted it wasnt after a few more tweeks she was controlling my computer from afar she declared it was time to bring in quicken technical support you can imagine my surprise since i had contacted her from the quicken technical support website she informed me that she was a third party tech and did n t work for intuit quicken that did n t surprise me much but what she said next totally floored me she said that in order to bring quicken support on to help i needed to be subscribed to one of their support plans that ranged from about 100 to 350 depending upon how long i wanted the plan to be in effect this was to support a piece of software that i had just purchased or 41 00 from amazon i really thought there was just a misunderstanding at first but quickly realized that was not that case i asked to speak to a supervisor at that point nabout 10 or 15 minutes later the supervisor came on line he explained again that they did n t work for quicken he never mentioned intuit and that they were 3rd party support when i pointed out that quicken was paying them to provide support he quickly said no that was not true nobody was paying them to provide this support i guess the work ethic in pakistan or india or wherever this gent was is a lot stronger than here in the states i did n t have any more to say nthe good news is that i was able to fix my problems with quicken 2015 on my own with a little help from the web but i would bet that the average joe would not have been so lucky i do n t know how customer support in this country sank to the levels that now exist but if there were a decent replacement for quicken i would be entertaining it now this response is way too long for amazon to post on the review section but i have seen really long ones before i am going to ask them to post it n nrobert s
3;61;32;0.8071745689809899;a little about me so you do n t think i am incompetent i have a masters degree have used quicken 2010 for two years and i am an easygoing and patient man i am also computer literate the problem is quicken at least this version as i type this january 14 2015 i have the most updated version r 4 i have spent last few days with customer service working on duplicate transactions transactions not posting and quicken even crashing i have searched the depths of the internet looking for answers including quickens online communities and found that i am not alone with the issues i am experiencing rather my experience seems to be very common n ni have no problem paying 100 or more for this software i just wished it worked 2015 is very similar to the 2010 version i had it is not like they completely redesigned this program but still they have these fundamental problems it is unacceptable but what are we to do because quicken is the only software that i am aware of that helps us track our finances mint com now owned by quicken quality has dropped of recent so i decided to purchase quicken 2015 my last stint with customer service was around 2 hours and at the end they told me they will have a technician call me in a week because they are unable to further assist me we will see how that goes total hours spent with customer service around 7 hours i will never see those 7 hours again and now i will have to spend more time with a technician on january 20 2015 n ni write this because i hope some kid or entrepreneur will read this decide there is a need for a quality product like this and be a competitor to quicken quickens quality has dropped to such a low level it is sad i sincerely hope your experience is like the five star reviews some report on here but i just cant see how that is possible if you decide to purchase this say hi to ricky or jane at customer service for me as i envision you will be speaking with them best of luck
4;25;34;0.8012278371279513;i rarely write reviews on amazon but i am so fed up with intuit and quicken that i am compelled to write this i ve been using quicken for nearly 20 years for the most basic simple stuff tracking my purchases and account balances and downloading them from my bank into quicken for reconciliation no stocks no investments no reporting and net worth evaluations no credit reports no budgeting and planning n nas the versions have progressed quicken has become buggier and buggier it duplicates check numbers that i never entered it incorrectly marks transactions as cleared even the scrolling in many windows is just plain confusing you scroll up but the window scrolls down contrary to company s name it has become less and less intuitive n ni have been using the deluxe edition which has way more bells and whistles than i use yet the simpler starter version will not let me import existing data from the deluxe edition so i have to pay for and use features i do n t need n nthe most frustrating thing about this software is that intuit forces users to pay for an upgrade every 3 years they actually disable the functionality that allows us to download transactions from our bank after 3 years if we do n t upgrade this is extortion i ve held my nose and paid up for the last few cycles but am so sick of this abuse of their customers this year that i m not buying it again for what would be the 5th time intuit is losing me as a customer with their obnoxious tactics n ni m hoping that if enough people follow suit that intuit will change their policies until then sayonara intuit if you are still inclined to buy quicken be prepared to buy it again in three years and three years after that
5;29;26;0.7879249434002491;away from this software you are better off using a spreadsheet i bought 2014 last year and immediately began struggling with it despite being a 30 year it veteran who has built and worked with complex software while many of the things it attempts to do are elegant in concept it is a struggle to use them in practice and there is effectively no support i bought 2015 hoping that it would improve things but they have only gone downhill after spending hours categorizing all my amazon transactions for my credit card account my checking account for which downloading transactions had quit working disappeared when i attempted to use their account reset function and quicken locked up i had to cancel out of it to get it going again and the account was now nowhere to be seen i went through the process of re adding the account but it still would n t show so i tried to get help all that is available is online chat with what is clearly an overseas office between quirks in the english being sent me and there not getting what i told them straightforwardly multiple times the account is not showing in the account list it was very frustrating and i do n t blame the person who was trying to help me however the bottom line is the session was a waste of time doing trivial things and intuit is not supporting this software to be clear i am not trying to do anything exotic i have a credit card checking and savings account i am just trying to download transactions categorize them and report on them against my budget in a way that is useful to me about the reporting piece you still are limited to using or slightly modifying one of their reports there is no truly custom report capability based on my experience i caution you on trying to use this software you will find it a waste of time and money
6;59;21;0.7740536259716769;i have been using quicken for about 10 years until the 2015 version i was a loyal intuit user when i upgraded to quicken 2015 from quicken 2013 i discovered that you must sign in to your intuit account and provide personal information such as your mailing address to use the product i did have my quicken 2013 version linked to their cloud service and was happy to have that as an optional feature however with quicken 2015 i was unable to install the product or access my local financial data without signing in to a quicken on line account and providing extra personal information n nintuit really broke trust with me by holding my local financial information hostage i immediately requested a refund and went back to quicken 2013 until i can find an alternative solution i am sad that one my long time favorite brands thought they could force me to provide personal information what was a great optional feature that i used in quicken 2013 became the deal breaker for me in 2015 i will still synch to the cloud but i will not use a software product that blocks access to my personal financial data locally
7;77;15;0.7476234203972142;intuit recently informed me they will not support connected services for quicken 2012 after april 30 and offered me an upgrade to quicken 2015 for 54 99 which anybody can buy at amazon for 42 55 i ve been down that road and i do n t have a reason to jump onto that treadmill again for any price ni started with quicken in 1994 when intuit made high quality software and supported it a distant memory i now run quicken 2012 i spite of many frustrating hours of effort i was never able to get connected services to work i managed to get quicken to connect with some financial institutions but even then transactions downloaded correctly were outnumbered by duplicate transactions missing transactions and transactions posted to the wrong accounts neither i nor the financial institutions were able to resolve the problems ourselves or get any worthwhile assistance from intuit i just wasted hours trying thus the connected services were and are valueless so i wo n t lose anything on april 30 with less time and much less frustration i set up scheduled transactions with dummy amounts and manually edit them after each transaction is completed essentially manually entering the transactions with a lot less clerical effort for an ordinary joe public with an ira a few investments i do n t actively manage day to day and some bills to pay every month i guaranty that manual method is less time consuming and frustrating than going through the process of debugging the quicken connected services installation every three years after my unsuccessful experience trying to get connected services to work without help from intuit i skipped the last two annual quicken upgrades and i do n t have any problems nquicken 2015 does n t add any significant capability reviews indicate connection services usability is still a frustrating crap shoot and customer service has actually gotten worse eliminating all phone support so why buy quicken 2015 if you have a version of quicken running and stable be thankful do yourself a big favor and never upgrade again let intuit keep their bug filled connected services unless you actively trade and really need daily price updates use your old stable version of quicken to set up scheduled transactions and edit them manually your cardiologist will thank you nas long as the money rolls in they just do n t care and neither the product nor the support will get any better so stop ending money
8;51;22;0.7317257595118422;i ve been using quicken since it originally was introduced many years ago i appreciate being able to manage all my finances in a single place download the transactions across all my accounts and create reports that show how and where i spend my money however what i do n t appreciate is being pretty much forced to now upgrade quicken on an annual basis whether i want to or not i was running quicken 2014 which i only installed about 6 months ago as usual the endless reminders about needing to upgrade to quicken 2015 started at the beginning of january unchecking the dialog box that says remind me later is meaningless since the same dialog box will then come up each time you open quicken regardless of what you ve checked therefore to stop that irritation i went ahead and bought quicken 2015 which looks pretty much like quicken 2014 to me which looked pretty much like quicken 2013 intuit should just announce that quicken is now an annual license and quit fooling around like this n nhere s a useful tip for anyone that is planning to upgrade from quicken 2014 to quicken 2015 if your quicken password has special characters in it etc change your password to remove those characters in quicken 2014 before you load quicken 2015 otherwise during the installation of quicken 2015 your quicken 2014 installation will be completely removed you will then try to open your quicken data file in quicken 2015 and you will be told your password is invalid you will try it about 10 more times before you refer to the intuit site for help you will then find a lot of useless posts on how to change your password on intuit com but nowhere will you be told that the geniuses at intuit forgot to make sure that quicken 2015 can open a 2014 file secured by a password with special characters this same thing happened a couple years ago so evidently their learning curve is low your only option at that point appears to be to dig out your copy of quicken 2014 open your quick data file change your password to one without special characters save the file re open the file successfully in quicken 2015 then change your password back to something more secure that uses special characters that s super convenient is n t it n nif you remove the special characters in your password before you start the installation of quicken 2015 it should go pretty smoothly for you
9;64;39;0.7055561860785671;i wanted to get the new year off on the right foot with some budgeting and financial planning so i bought quicken 2015 to help me so far all i ve gotten for my money is a lot of frustration and headache i ca n t figure out why banks as big as the ones i bank with are either not even on the list of available institutions or simply wo n t connect some work fine others just do n t exist and the online help for this product is a joke i wish i d saved my money and just started keeping a handwritten spending log it probably would have been about the same amount of work
10;45;12;0.6589834849890159;i worked in accounting for years then got my masters in computer information systems i now work in financial systems consulting i have also used quicken for years have n t budged from 2013 due to the horrid reviews on just about every site imaginable including amazon facebook etc i helped a friend install her new and improved quicken 2015 last weekend i was absolutely astounded at the number of obvious bugs and issues with the application quicken is no longer a quality application and i would never ever recommend it to anyone someone mentioned a class action suit against them i m sure my friend would be happy to join the effort i will definitely not be moving away from my old version of quicken apparently it s from an historical time when they cared about quality and customer service i have worked with numerous financial systems both small and very very large but i ve never seen such trash as quicken 2015
11;22;14;0.580261235195767;have been using it for decades but suddenly it is now requiring me to sign in to quicken com in order to use the program i do not have any desire to share my private financial data with intuit this is incredibly offensive
12;62;10;0.5465718990996581;this is a review sent to intuit for a download problem associated the 2015 version of quicken give this fix to your tech department one of my brokerage account would n t update transactions into the register prompting that this institution does allow transaction downloads the flag noted that i had transactions to accept but there was no place to accept them even in the to do list i had to go to accounts list and hit edit hit the the blue automatic entry is on and turn it off for all accounts then the unaccepted transactions were accessible to accept i have seen this problem mentioned in your user blogs your help line service was unfortunately useless on this problem and requested me to pay for a service contract to have them manually download my transactions into to my quicken without actually fixing the software glitch i m very disappointed with that response hope you fix this program problem in an update soon so we can automatically have transactions entered into the register in the future
13;40;7;0.5222156291673139;we have used quicken since it ran on dos 20 or so years it was good then and intuit was good but in recent years the software has gotten bloated and seems buggier and worse ith every release why do n t they just debug it and make it work right we d still be happy to pony up 40 to intuit every three years but just make it work nwe upgraded from quicken 2013 to this and again it s worse nwe are looking at moneydance and gnucash and will switch soon ngoodbye quicken we had some good times but it s over now ntwo stars for old times sake

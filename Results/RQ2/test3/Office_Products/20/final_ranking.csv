3;1;4;0.5761984004754604;this bag will work just fine for what i wanted it for i read many reviews before purchasing and i d like to clarify things i still had questions concerns about this is not an extra large bag but the demensions do n t lie it is what they say they are i do n t have an extra large bible that i needed to fit in it and my standard size bible fits perfectly because i do n t have an extra large bible and because i m not using this case as a jacket cover for my bible i wanted more of a carrying cas i can use the flaps as pockets for my notebooks and devotion book as well as tucking my bible in the other side there are 2 holders to keep pens as well i even through my small clip board in there which i keep all of my church s weekly bulletins zipped it all up and have everything i need for church or bible study all in one case exactly what i was looking for i did n t give 5 stars because i do find the quality of the case to be a little plastic like but not enough to return it or not use it and it was really inexpensive and i also think the design of the zipper is poor and it s hard to get started when you re ready to close all things considered i would definitely recommend this item to keep you organized and ready for your study

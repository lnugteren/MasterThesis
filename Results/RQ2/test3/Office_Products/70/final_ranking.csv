0;5;43;0.8783066799405587;it s been a long time since i last took the sat and increasingly i find myself encountering words that i know i used to know but can no longer recognize it turned into embarassment a month ago when i tried to read out a story for a kid and there were half a dozen words i either did n t know the meanings or how to pronounce time to get a dictionary n nso i picked up this franklin speaking merriam webster s collegiate dictionary 11th edition that s its full official product name i chose it because of its speaking feature i found the price a bit too high but i was willing to shell out the dough for the franklin name as well as the venerable merriam webster brand my first real dictionary was an m w n nupon receiving the franklin and thoroughly playing with it i find myself both excited and disappointed here s why n nthis electronic dictionary has a lot of features it has a dictionary with a claimed vocabulary for 200 000 words but who s counting there s also a 500 000 entry thesaurus then there are lots of learning tools like an sat word list and games like hangman and letris you can even turn on a setting called learn a word so every time you turn on the dictionary a word and its definition are displayed allowing you to build up your vocabulary randomly n nthe dictionary feature is the one i bought this for and for the most part it s great each word entry gives you its part of speech its year of first use some amazing trivia here definitions of course some usage examples synonyms and etymology most words also have a spoken pronunciation but no written pronunciation key i m very disappointed that the speech is computer generated speech not human recorded speech last year when i was traveling in asia i saw electronic dictionaries in the 100 range with real human speech the quality was just amazing i really wish franklin had used human speech or at least provided written pronunciation keys to supplement the poor sounding computer voice n nyou can view the word screen in three different sizes small 11 lines medium 8 lines or large 6 lines large size is by far the best looking not only because the font is big but it s also smooth the other two sizes look too jagged and there s often a shadow behind the text that makes reading difficult there is no backlight on this thing making it impossible to use in the dark n nunfortunately i ve found a few words by no means tricky words or foreign ones that are not in this dictionary but i can find on the free encarta online dictionary this is very disappointing making me suspicious of the vocabulary capacity of this product n none more thing that disappoints me the overall build quality of the product is rather poor assembled in malaysia it just feels cheap period it s made of gray plastic that ages quickly and the thumbboard buttons are the worst i ve ever used i ve used countless pda thumbboards as well as those in the treo sidekick blackberry etc the buttons are hard tactilely and not very responsive the flip cover is a total joke and can come off very easily i m very disappointed in the quality of this product that cost me 90 bucks n non the plus side this franklin uses 2 easy to find and cheap aaa batteries i ca n t comment on the battery life yet since i just got this a couple days ago but given it does n t have backlight i imagine it should last a few weeks of moderate use n nbecause i did not check out other electronic dictionaries like those from casio or sharp i can not do a comparative review let me just say that i regret not having done more homework before i made the purchase i really should have compare shopped i took a blind trust in the franklin name and frankly i m rather disappointed for close to 100 i expected more in terms of quality and dictionary capacity i personally do n t care for its bell and whistle features
1;12;59;0.8323879563398403;overall i bought this as a substitute for a bulky paper dictionary just to look up words as i m reading for this purpose it is nice if you want to know how a word is pronounced however well here s a letter i wrote to franklin n n n ndear sir or madam n nas an owner of several franklin products i am familiar with the company s commitment to quality electronics i recently purchased the scd 1870 electronic dictionary and generally have been satisfied with the unit it is the most extensive handheld dictionary i have found yet and i have occasion to use a dictionary frequently n nhaving read reviews of the product from several sources i anticipated that the speaking function would give ambiguous pronunciations thus i was pleased to see on the product s packaging figure 1 that a textual pronunciation key would accompany each word as occurs in all the other electronic dictionaries that i have encountered n n figure 1 n ni now believe that this is not the case and that the speech function was intended to replace the text pronunciation i appreciate the advances in speech technology but this design leads to several disappointing consequences n nfirstly pronunciations can be ambiguous n nch often sounds like sh as in champion n nsecondly uncommon pronunciations can be chosen n neschew appears to be pronounced is choo which is the fourth pronunciation listed on the merriam webster web site n nthirdly pronunciations can be incorrect n nhors d oeuvre appears to be pronounced or duv r rather than or d rv the only pronunciation listed on the merriam webster web site n nlastly no pronunciation may be included n ni had to refer to a normal dictionary to find the pronunciation for hacek n nthe second most common reason i refer to the dictionary is to learn the definitive pronunciation for a word and while the speech function is passable for most applications i feel i was misled by the product s advertisement including a pronunciation in the text of each entry would be a definite improvement to the unit for the reasons listed above and for the increased convenience of not needing headphones in the library or other quiet place n noverall i am pleased with the product s expansive lexicon and accurate definitions and with its expandability and word games however i may not have paid full price had the packaging not depicted the presence of in text pronunciation i appreciate your attention to this matter n n
2;28;57;0.7894843318072594;this is the first electronic dictionary i have ever owned i have always used a bulky book dictionary and was biased in favor of the old tried by true method i checked out several electronic dictionaries before i spent a bit more money in choosing franklin s scd 1870 n ni never understood the advantages of carrying a 200 000 word dictionary in your pocket this little machine is a wonder the dictionary application as expected is just fine and dandy it s the other functions that wow me thesaurus learning tools word games grammar guide signs symbols tables astrology biology chemical elements etc a clock and a calculator and your own word list a feature i use while reading a book if i run across a word i do n t know or unsure of it is added it to my word list which enables me to review at a later time get the correct definition and see how it can be used in a sentence you can also buy an attachment that allows you to hook it up to your computer and if that s not enough you can plug in one of the many bookman electronic cards thus your machine metamorphoses into an entirely different product like magic n nthere are way to many applications to go into here but rest assured if you are a word freak enamored with the english language then franklin s little machine is for you after a few hours you will wonder how you ever got along without it n na great gift for a student son or daughter or just about anyone else for that manner
3;44;29;0.7871319299716949;the small size and light weight of this dictionary make it easy to carry everywhere so it is convenient to use i particular like the feature that allows me to learn a word every time i turn the dictionary on there are other features such as games that i do n t think are very useful for me i like the pronunciation feature that helps me learn how to pronounce new words unfortunately the sound is kind of hard to discern the sound is a little not natural and smooth this dictionary would be better if its covering is made of some metal rather than leather and has a pocket i have to buy my own pocket to store the dictionary and backup batteries however overall i like this dictionary
4;57;24;0.7516079973439951;i have had this dictionary over a year i use it daily i use such features as a dictionary synonims and pronunciation english is a second language for me so those features are very helpful and importamt also i like the way words are explained they are explained in simple manner if i have a trouble still to understanding a meaning of a word i press for thesaurus some other time i have a trouble to understand a word in explanation so i underline it and press a botton for clarification in addition i use thesaurus for selecting words when i write an essay just replacing the same words with similar in meanings my children find it useful and easy to use too i love the this dictionary
5;59;30;0.7150037765143714;in order to be able to find the dictionary when i needed it i bought each of my kids a dictionary too they were always borrowing it because of the features for your own personal vocabulary list and speaking spelling bee we all love the convenience of not having to use a bulky dictionary when we were reading and came across an unfamiliar word we especially love the dictionary s ability to pronounce the words i was particularly pleased that i was able to look up the pronunciations of different chemical compounds used in lamination processes in a graduate level chemistry book i was reading i ca n t recommend this dictionary enough for every student when my kids start taking foreign languages i will buy them the module for that particular language to help them with their studies

11;14;16;0.6658981927900174;this is a really good portable e dictionary to own i ve bought this for for my child to take to school instead of carrying the regular dictionary in book form although it s more expensive than many other e dictionaries out there on the market you d truly get what you pay for on this gadget it makes no sense to own an e dictionary if it does not contain definitions of words you ve entered in it i had a list of words used to check and compare the sophistication of many e dictionaries the word list consisted of advanced science words medical words as well as advanced collegiate words this is the only e dictionary on the market where it returned with definitions for all but one word on the list the majority of other e dictionaries failed after the first or second word on my list n nfurthermore my kid s writing teacher a retired english teacher had at first disapproved of using this e dictionary and recommended buying the book well my kids let her try it out while they re working on an assignment she came back at the end of class to say that this e dictionary is really good now how s that for an endorsement of this product
12;52;15;0.6516884499471978;i paid about 80 for this and do n t regret it because i m planning on using it throughout my college years it s handy if you want to expand your vocabulary but do n t want to waste precious time pouring over a large dictionary n nthe small slanted keys the main thing that is n t quite appealing to me i have slender fingers and can imagine how annoying they may be for males it is just not pleasant to the touch n notherwise i would recommend it although the price is a bit steep but if you take care of it perhaps you ll think its a worthy investment

14;10;20;0.6296798083878337;this is an updated review i originally experienced some miscommunication with the manufacturer however i am pleased to say that they did ultimately resolve the problem nthe dictionary is great it is very convenient to carry around the speak feature helps with pronunciation of unusual words and the e bookman card expansion feature to add other e books saves a lot of money i did receive a defective bookman card at one point but franklin sent me a replacement right away
15;11;10;0.5920357569547527;this product is okay it is a good product for its price however i have some frustrations over its functionality its processor is quite slow if one types in a word incorrectly it can take up to good 5 10 seconds searching for the best matching words moreover the keypads are too stiff it requires too much effort to depress its buttons my fingers often get fatigued during a long stretch of reading or maybe i am looking up too many words furthermore its pronunciation function is not reliable despite its less than perfect pronunciation the manufacturer failed to provide pronunciation symbols thus one must rely only on its verbal feedback on the positive side it provides clear and succinct definitions portability and durability n ni have another brand of electronic dictionary by sharp and its functionality and ease of use is phenomenal it comes with a built in voice recorder with an expansion sm card slot thus enables user to record several hours of voice recording furthemore its processor is super fast and keypads are smooth however my sharp does not have clear and succint of definition as franklin and its extremely expensive 375 usd n nin conclusion frankline is a good buy considering its price
16;32;13;0.5152114118678266;positive n n1 the dictionary is adequate for my needs and it functioned well n nnegative n n2 the cover is very flimsy it broke off and fixing it myself was impossible this particular design part needs improvement n nan additional improvement n n3 if even at the cost of extra weight it would be very nice to have the ability to light the screen

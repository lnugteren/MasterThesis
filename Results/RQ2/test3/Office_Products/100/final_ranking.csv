0;81;79;0.7735780682641752;i have so many black cables from various computer and electronic items many of those cables i do n t even remember what device they are for so i decided i needed a white marker to label them these markers are gray which is fine for labeling black stuff the ink dries fairly fast n nthe one problem i have with these markers is that they are not fine point like it says on the package the writing comes out pretty thick and i was n t pressing that hard i tried writing the number 6 which is supposed to have a dot in it and the letter b which is supposed to have 2 dots in it but all those dots were filled in since the marker is so thick when you re trying to label black cables there really is n t much space for you to write on so you need a fine point marker unfortunately these are not fine point n nedit it s now a couple weeks after i got these and the ink on a cable i had written on has smeared so it is not permanent like the product description says
1;25;98;0.7682217278541655;when i first discovered the sharpie permanent fine point markers i became an instant fan i am still a huge fan of these markers for labeling freezer and storage bags and cardboard boxes however some 3m post it flags which i use a lot are just too small for the fine point markers for that i use the ultra fine point markers n njust like the fine point markers these markers seem to last a long time if you take care to cap them as soon as you are finished with them you also need to be careful not to get the tips wet or to damage the tip but as long as you do not drop the pen on its tip it is reasonably durable i have seen a few people crush the tips of these markers including a couple that were borrowed from me sigh by pushing on them too hard but generally these are people who should be using a ball point pen anyway n nwe have tried a lot of different pens and markers for writing on plastic and have had limited success many pens seem to take forever to dry or will not mark on plastic magic markers work but they are too wide and have an unlovely smell so far sharpie permanent fine point and ultra fine point markers avoid these problems and provide sharp print for nearly all labeling needs in fact i will warn you that you should take care what you write on because once you have used the sharpie it can be nearly impossible to get the ink out n ni will also concur with another reviewer who pointed out that the ultra fine point sharpie can be an artist s instrument while my sketches are not what i would call art the very fine point permits a lot of detail and even shading effects to provide more ability try using the sharpie fine point and the sharpie ultra fine point these two pens give you quite a drawing arsenal
2;61;12;0.703114538875314;i am a sharpie devotee i use them for my artwork that is mostly pen and pencil drawings i do a lot of fine detail work and use these ultra fine point pens what is nice about sharpie is their consistency for color with the exception of these special 24 packs they put out every once in a while this particular order was the 80s glam color when they do these specialty series for lack of a better name they basically give you nineteen of the traditional color of pens and trade out five of their normal colors for five brand new color introductions with the 80s glam color series the specialty colors are as follows n n power pink n racy red n super sonic yellow n jet set jade and n brilliant dove n nsince i started with sharpies i have just stuck with them over the years there are still a few issues i have with the sharpie brand i wish they would code their pens with either a color name or number because as you change from one pen type it another i e fine point to ultra fine point a few of the colors are so close you can not go by the color of the cap to match colors since there is no name or number you end up going to a scrap piece of paper to ensure you are picking the equivalent matching color this taking your eyes off of the art piece you are working on i also wish there was one more level of pens smaller than the ultra fine point the ultra fine point still leaves a lot of ink on the paper if your pen rests for even a moment in time the ultra fine point pen will puddle they are really only good for drawing as they simply bleed through standard college rule paper

4;53;24;0.689114468766805;i love me some black ultra fine point sharpies the only thing better than an ultra fine point black sharpie is a box of 12 ultra fine point black sharpies especially at this price the permanent ink combined with the awesomely ultra fine tip is what people adore about these marker pens very simple but very powerful these are kind of like the little black dress of mark making the ink is fadeproof the barrel is comfortable to hold the marker pen seems to be filled with a never ending supply of deep black ink and the tips spring back time after time i can use one sharpie for weeks without ever worrying about the tip flattening out sharpies can write on an incredible variety of surfaces even writing on fabric the writing is clear and readable assuming it was legibly written ha there is a reason sharpie ultra fine point permanent markers are a classic and i do n t see that changing anytime soon these are the best ever
5;65;28;0.6736559702101789;these markers come in very pretty colors i like to color in adult coloring books and these work very well for most books i have a couple of books that these bleed outside the lines on but on other books they work great depends on the quality of the paper i guess they do bleed through to the back of the page too but i keep something under the page to absorb the excess they have lasted well too they have a great fine point which makes them good for small parts of the designs as long as they re on good paper at least overall i m very well pleased with them
6;18;5;0.6113502805057731;i bought these to use in my coloring books they are vibrant and wonderful they do bleed a little through the paper but i have one sided coloring pages anyway as a precaution i also add 2 blank sheets of paper behind the page that i m currently coloring i m so glad i purchased these and i will be purchasing more when i need to replace them n n a data hook product link linked class a link normal href sharpie permanent markers ultra fine point assorted colors 24 count dp b002766v3k ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 sharpie permanent markers ultra fine point assorted colors 24 count a
7;35;6;0.605286572537511;i love these sharpie pens they are great with my spirograph because they are such a fine point and write so easily but do n t smear at all i use thick paper i used watercolor paper for a while then switched to a pad of thick paper from the kid s craft section at t arget so there is no bleed through
8;58;10;0.5665171128553427;received these tonight i was hoping to be able to use these in my disc bound arc system but these bleed badly i find the arc and tul paper to be good quality and i rarely have ghosting and never bleed through using a different set of sharpies and fountain pens these have a strong odor too
9;74;20;0.5532580334724246;these are the best for writing on black plastic i use them to write on each power block electric adapter plug as soon as i get something new it is so nice to know what device each plug goes to very clear and easy to see i also used them to write power and volume next to the buttons on my dads black tv he had dementia and would lose the remote and could n t figure out which button was which n ni also bought two more packs for christmas presents

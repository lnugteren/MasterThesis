0;13;22;0.7221122521830287;i could n t find the dimensions of the little arms that hold the book but i can tell you that there is less than 1 5 of space between the arm and the back i have a 4 5 text book i wanted to set up but if i divide the pages into thirds i can get it to work it s alright but not what i really wanted the construction is solid and it s a nice stand just a pain for thick books
1;2;19;0.7171360574564603;i purchased this product in the expectation that it was rather large per the picture showing a big book resting on it unfortunately it only holds books at a depth of 1 5 inches which is useless for the programming books and other textbooks i own also the stand does n t have a lock it is instead combined with the page holders on the front to create a rather cumbersome mechanism the lack of any real helpful adjustments also made this purchase a regretful one if you are going to use books of any real thickness look elsewhere as i know i just wasted 10
2;21;5;0.6841046983743727;i was very happy with the price of this book stand n ni have been using it with a spiral bound paperback book i end up having to balance a clipboard behind the book to hold the book up so i can read it the pages are also very hard to turn i have damaged the bottom of my pages by using this book stand n ni am going to purchase the plastic 11 one from fellowes which is also highly rated i have that one at school and have been very happy with it n ni do not recommend this book stand for books it would probably work well for a tablet computer or ipad or something i will hold onto it in case i buy another product to use it with
3;12;14;0.4727404095065289;not good for paperbacks there is no support in the back so the top half corners of the book fold back it s also not stable unless your in the middle of the book when the pages distribute the book weight evenly i would would look elsewhere
4;9;3;0.4034296755875231;this is so bad that i need to write a review so people stop wasting money on this and go for one of the other stands i have 3 different stands from amazon i had two foldable book holders from the harvard bookstore years ago which were amazing even for heavy overpriced physics books with atrociously short shelf lives i ve since found the stands on amazon mighty bright fold n stow sadly they got lost at some point i bought this fellowes stand as an add on from amazon beware this thing simply is n t designed to hold heavy or even normal books the foldable prongs are just too close together for this stand to bear any significant weight i ended up shelling out the money and bought one 10 mighty bright as well as an 15 actto book holder from amazon the actto takes up a little more space in my bag but it really is worth it even better than the mighty bright well built and as i write this review it s propping open a hefty 900 page hardback 9 x 12 science textbook i read elsewhere that the fellowes stand has been around for some 35 years to my knowledge books were just as thick heavy back then so i do n t know how it managed to sell before the age of the tablet which is all this stand is good for bottom line this cheap stand is exactly that if you re looking for a book holder skip this one and spend a bit more on a stand that s worth it
5;4;4;0.38948753811749437;ordered this for my son who does home school it makes it easier to look at his text books while he s doing his work it holds large school books 11 x 8 and up to about 2 inches wide its sturdy and easy to use it s very simple and it is small when not in use so it s also easy to store it was an awesome price and i would recommend it to anyone

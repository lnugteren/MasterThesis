0;41;35;0.8695297438966282;after reading the reviews posted on this product a bunch of fine reviews too i must say there seems to be a very wide range of opinion concerning this electric pencil sharpener after reading both the good and bad reviews it would almost seem like we are all talking about two completely different products i am not sure why this is happening and can only speculate i suspect that it is a combination of things ranging from customer s different expectations all the way to some major quality control issues at the factory where ever that is where the sharpeners are made n nbe that as it may i can only tell you my personal experiences with this particular product i had and have an earlier model of this sharpener here on my desk it has given me about eight years of very dependable services of late though you can tell it is suffering from old age and is about to give up the ghost when these machines became available on vine i jumped at the chance n nthe price here is quite reasonable for what you are getting these are not industrial type sharpeners they are for light office use and i do not recommend them for use in places such as schools there are reasons for this first they are noisy unbelievable noisy as a matter of fact having a bunch of kids destroying perfectly good pencils for seven or eight hours could quite well drive you to distraction to say the least secondly these sharpeners are designed to do the work for you by that i mean you are suppose to gently but firmly place the pencil in the sharpener and let it work for you kids do not like to do this they will invariably cram the pencil in as hard as their little hands will allow and see how much pencil they can eat up before you tell them to stop that is just the way kids are always have been always will be if you put too much force on the pencil you will find that the point comes out quite lop sided with wood going all the way to the tip n nnow that being said when i first opened this sharpener i immediately sharpened 24 pencils that i had in my desk this sharpener is extremely fast and delivers a very very sharp point the down side here is that the exposed wood on the tip is a bit rougher than i like i suppose the single blade versus the double grinders found on hand sharpeners makes the difference this is a minor problem though and is more a personal thing than anything else n ni like the fact that this sharpener is electric rather than battery sharpeners eat up batteries at about the same rate they eat up pencils n ni liked the rather long cord it was much longer than my old model had which had created some problems in the past i also like the sleek look of this thing i also like the fact that it is heavy enough that you do not have to bolt it down somewhere i liked the fact that this machine did not break ever other point as it sharpened n nnow i do a lot of drawing and sharpen most of my drawing pencils by had using a knife this is particularly true of my colored pencils i am old it was the way i was trained and i have no intention of changing it should be noted though that if you use this machine or any other electric pencil sharpener that you may have a problem with some of the wax based leads in some of the colored pencils they can cause clogging that is the nature of most sharpeners n nthe reason i am giving this one four stars rather than five is due to the noise level and the fact that every so often you find that you get a lop sided tip this was probably my fault but i feel the machine should have been engineered to cover up my stupidity and ineptness n nnice sharpener for the money hope it lasts as long as the last one n ndon blankenship nthe ozarks
1;19;25;0.8019098532460033;i have 2 children in school homework is done with pencils and it s done every day it seems that we never have a sharp pencil when we need it i keep all of the pencils in one place but i pull out pencil after pencil after pencil and never seem to have a sharpened one when i need it we have several small plastic pencil sharpeners but they always seem to be lost honestly sharpening pencils by hand every day is tedious and annoying i decided i wanted an electric pencil sharpener so i turned to amazon i was shocked by how pricey that are after reading many reviews on this one i decided to make the purchase i ordered another item from amazon last week it still has n t arrived but this one came in about 2 days shockingly fast shipment i plugged it in and started sharpening pencils it is very fast and the pencils have a nice sharp tip i did notice that it tends to leave a bit too much of the wood on one corner fairly consistently but i just fixed this by rotating the pencil one time while sharpening i sharpened nearly 30 pencils and it took me less than 10 minutes at the most and several of the pencils were brand new and being sharpened for the first time i am very pleased i filled the shaving container and emptied the contents with no difficulty at all i am very impressed by this little machine and the price is much lower than any of the others with good reviews i like that it has a plug because i do n t want to have to replace batteries that is about as tedious as sharpening pencils by hand so i love the plug i would definitely recommend this product to anyone with school age children it is not just for business customers it s for anyone that uses a good old fashioned wooden pencil
2;32;42;0.7422137628290717;revised 1 2 2008 i ordered the hunt boston 1800 electric sharpener from shoplet and received the x acto xlr electric pencil sharpener in talking with shoplet s customer service department the amazon link is attached to the x acto product in shoplet s inventory x acto as well as hunt boston are now elmer s products inc brands i tried to research on the web whether the hunt boston 1800 is still made it is unclear this maybe the only model currently available n nshoplet issued me a full refund of the product and let me keep it we have are not heavy pencil users and have only sharpened 10 pencils so far but these are fine the pencils have pin sharp points occasionally with an unsharpened pencil the sharpener s auto shutoff does not activate and i pull the pencil out to check if it is sharp but other than that the unit is working fine
3;45;17;0.7173469471639723;received this sharpener today works well sharpens to a fine point it is not as shown on amazon xacto must have bought out hunt boston i will keep it as not one of the reviews i read complained about the ability of this sharpener to do its job for the money i ca n t complain workmanship appears to be adequate not spectacular i bought this to replace a panasonic i have owned since 1962 which is still running however the draw to remove the debris is slightly cracked the panasonic had two hole entrances one for large the other for small pencils this sharpener only has one the drawer does not hold as much debris as my panasonic therefore the only downside i can foresee is having to empty it frequently the price is very reasonable as battery operated ones i have tried at the same price do not compare in any way shape or form a safe purchase even if the photo on amazon is of an earlier model has anyone notified amazon of this discrepancy the amazon rep who reads this and all the other reviews prior to publishing comments should be picking up on this
4;11;21;0.7100219326516558;oh the madness we used to live in before i bought an x acto electric pencil sharpener n nin those days our four kids would sharpen new pencils using those handheld manual sharpeners that student stores sell for 89 cents and would then relegate the pencils to a drawer once their graphite tips broke off over the years this has led to quite an impressive collection of broken tipped pencils n n oh you need help with your math homework let me just get a pencil got one nope got one nope got one nope got one nope n ni finally grew frustrated enough to just order an electric sharpener i chose the x acto model based on price and reviews we have not been disappointed now this is not a top of the line model because it does feel a bit flimsy and when you insert a pencil too firmly into the sharpener the motor does slow down in protest but it gets the job done every time n nit gets the job done n nand now i have a drawer filled with sharp tipped pencils ready for eager young minds to use well not the minds per se but fingers controlled by the mind you know what i mean and when those pencil points grow dull my children know that our trusty x acto electric pencil sharpener is there that s right trusty n nthe madness is gone a calm serenity has enveloped our household thanks x acto
5;9;34;0.6876076747170133;coming from a family of educators we tend to be very picky about our pencil sharpeners we like them solid and efficient quickly driving the 2 down to a fine and sharp point without wasting much of the pencil length poorly designed sharpeners are horrible and often require you to constantly grind the pencil down before achieving an adequate point you will not have that problem with this pencil sharpener the x acto electric pencil sharpener is well built durable and finely tuned to meet your lead sharpening requirements the pencil is quickly sharpened to a fine exact point without being wasted disposal of the grind is easy with the removable trap we ve owned many of these sharpeners over the years and this one is the best so far highly recommended
6;16;6;0.6449597794043164;this x acto electric pencil sharpener was a good purchase it was purchased to replace another x acto model 1800 pencil sharpener that lasted about three years we are using it in our home but it sees pretty frequent use due to our having three elementary aged children after about six months this pencil sharpener is holding up well it sharpens well it does not make too much noise and it has a pretty strong motor for the price this was a great buy and after having some duds the x actos have performed better for us than the other electric pencil sharpeners we have tried in this price range our experience has been about a three year lifespan with the motor being the thing that goes first nsome minor nitpicks the motor will periodically stop mid job if you are sharpening a few pencils at a time presumably to keep the motor from overheating or becoming too taxed after a short respite it starts up again but that can be kind of annoying also the plastic on this units construction is thinner than the prior model we had bought just a few years ago lastly and most annoyingly emptying the tub of shavings is somewhat messy due to the vertical tub design noverall this unit was a decent purchase for us and should be for anyone needing assistance with light to moderate pencil sharpening duties nhaving owned the x acto 1800 prior i would go for that one if i were buying again as it felt and operated a bit more substantially and emptied cleanly the 1800 is a few dollars more but it is worth it in build operational quality ngood luck with the first day of school approaching we will surely test this sharpener s fortitude assume it continues to perform admirably if there is no update n nupdate 11 13 15 while the sharpener works very well and can handle a lot of usage emptying it is a royal pain that will undoubtedly require you clean up around it after removing the shavings
7;28;10;0.5168661426098541;awesome pencil sharpener always sharpens my pencils perfect i bought this for my kids i ve purchase many cheaper hand pencil sharpeners and they always seemed to do a half way job or most likely break my pencil lead right before i d finish sharpening the pencil n nonce i got this thing i have never had a messed up pencil from sharpening them it s so fast and no mess all shavings go into a removable collection bin this is perfect highly recommended

0;17;12;0.8610164140779072;the cuisinart convection oven with exact heat is one of the finest kitchen products i have had the privilege of owning in the last decade beside perhaps all clad cookware and shun knives it has literally changed my life and how i eat and what foods i can prepare and prepare to perfection to boot my friends n ni live in a bachelor apartment no stove or oven which for an active cook is hard i had been struggling with a cuisinart classic toaster oven and it was hard burnt foods on the top raw on the bottom then after two years of use only the broil function worked my faith in cuisinart products was nil n nin researching what new oven to buy i was shocked and quite dismayed to find a cuisinart product so highly rated and loved by it s owners how could this be from the toaster oven devils themselves i was not darn it about to purchase another cuisinart product no sireeebob let alone one for 150 but the endless glowing reviews here at amazon and elsewhere on the net convinced me to put the last of my faith in another bout with cuisinart the reviews on this oven were just so glowing and up it was hard to find anyone who had anything bad to say about this product owner after owner after owner raved over this oven n nwell i am pleased to report all the accolades for this small oven are true and my faith was well invested i can finally bake again and not just bake but bake like i have never done before even with big gas ovens chocolate chip cookies roasted green beans and butternut squash biscuits frozen lasagna whole chickens home made bread from scratch it all comes out wonderfully browned to perfection evenly baked the convection feature and the exact heat technology on this oven is nothing short of amazing n nit has honestly brought a tear to this bachelor s eye to be able to bake anything with confidence n ni roasted a 4lb whole chicken for my mom on mothers day and she agreed that not only did it look the part of an all over golden brown piece of poultry perfection but that it s taste lived up to it s looks juicy and perfectly done under the crisp and crackling but not dried out skin and it cooked in 50 minutes to boot n ni have only toasted one bagel so far so i do not have the experience to report on the toasting features of this oven however the bagel did come out very nice indeed and the oven boasts some extensive toasting features n ni have found the best success with the convection feature by reducing the recipes or instructions recommended temperature by 25 and also reducing the baking time by 25 30 n nif you are contemplating a toaster convection oven despite some horrible experiences with cuisinart in the past i wholeheartedly recommend this wonderful and god send oven with great enthusiasm you wo n t be sorry and in fact you may come to hate your regular oven and come to wish as i do that cuisinart would make a model that was just a tad bigger to accommodate 13 bakeware
1;30;82;0.8577834703939151;i m a big fan of doing a lot of cooking in my toaster oven since i am single and generally cook just for myself i had an old large toaster oven and had not been able to find a good replacement for it although i ve been looking for years my fullsize oven is convection and i knew it does a great job with meat in particular but just hate cooking small meals in there and wasting all that energy so when i saw this oven i knew i had to get it it s a bit pricey but now that i have it i do n t regret the purchase at all hard to pass up with free shipping as well n nfirst it s nice and roomy inside i think it s as big as my old one it just does n t look it from the outside looks great on the counter very modern and built well the controls look a little intimidating at first and you will have to read the manual to figure them out but after using them a couple times it s pretty straightforward the toasting features are incredible i am real picky about my toast and bagels ca n t stand them over toasted and black and this oven did a perfect job with them from the first try n nas for the convection features i ve done pork and chicken so far and they turned out great it takes a little getting used to in terms of cooking temperatures and times but when done correctly your food will be wonderfully moast and yummy i particularly like being able to set a timer which will turn the oven off automatically i ve not seen a toaster oven with this feature before and it definitely help to keep from overcooking food n nthe oven comes with a nice large broiler pan but you may want to look around for other toaster oven pans as once you have this you will find yourself using it a lot i probably use mine at least 1 2 times a day n nupdate well i m still using my toaster oven almost 5 years later and still loving it it s easy to clean with a slide out crumb tray and just works beautifully i love the convection to do some quick browning at the end of cooking frozen foods and such and for toasting bagels muffins whatever it just ca n t be beat clearly it stands the test of time and should give you many years of use
2;23;70;0.8382442622905992;i decided to buy this toaster oven on the strength of it s reviews here as well as it s cousin model tob 175bc which was ranked 1 by consumer reports the 20 off promo and free shipping from amazon was the selling point for me final cost 110 it lists for 220 the only difference i noticed between the two is that this one is white and the other is black chrome the 175bc model is also 50 more expensive i wanted this one primarily because of the convection feature that s a new technology in toaster ovens i also liked the removable crumb tray non stick interior and digital touch pad controls n n i understand these are more expensive than most of the other toaster ovens on the market and that may drive a lot of ppl elsewhere however cuisinart has apparently built a quality one here and the 3yr warranty shows they are willing to stand behind it i agree w other reviewers that mentioned cuisinart should ve added some insulation to prevent the top from getting extremely hot if they can do it for regular toasters why not toaster ovens too maybe it s a cost cutting thing but it would make this product safer i agree that they could have added interior led lights backlit lcd and also auto shutoff after the timer expires makes good practical sense making it larger than 5 cu ft is also good cuisinart i look forward to their next gen models hopefully they will make it even better n n i ve read a lot of reviews from ppl complaining about how toaster ovens toast bread personally i do n t think that s what toaster ovens should be used for although it can i have a regular toaster for that purpose i mainly wanted a toaster oven because i liked the fact i would n t need to use the big oven and heat the whole house especially important during the summer i m guessing it may even use less electricity which also is a plus i sometimes eat frozen foods which i bake and this will be perfect for that also great for cooking reheating pizza up to 9 and chicken up to 4 5lbs n n anyways hope my review helps i recommend this model tob 165 happy cooking thanks amazon
3;6;28;0.8361429229311471;we previously had a delonghi toaster oven which we really liked ever since purchasing it about 13 or so years ago i liked it so much that my parents bought a similar delonghi model a few years later unfortunately their model very quickly developed defective knobs that were positionally indefinite or would stick on not good folks recently ours developed a sticky knob syndrome after the second piece of toast catching fire in the kitchen i threw the toaster oven out regrettably its a shame because it did a pretty good job and we gladly used it several times every day toast chicken fish roasting vegetables loved it hardly ever needed our regular oven n nwe started researching convection toaster ovens some of the newer delonghi reviews complained of an initial smell that we wanted to inspect for ourselves the smell concern is indeed mentioned in their manual this made us seriously wonder what they were imparting into our food over time n nthe cuisinart had no such issue it also had glowing reviews we tried finding it in the stores to get a first hand sense of the product unfortunately we could not find it anywhere n nafter reading many reviews and considering what consumer reports had to say we decided to get the white cuisinart tob 165 convection toaster oven right out of the box it works great and has ever since toast are you kidding i ve never seen toast so smoothly toasted before it almost looks like someone used a spray can to paint a browned look on it consistent dependable precise settings you know what to expect from it it even takes advantage of it being previously heated to calculate measure the temp for you the remaining amount of time required to toast another piece precisely the way you d expect it smart efficient that way it also lets you know when the target temp has been reached useful prior to baking some things very nice indeed n nwe ve noticed how it seems to bring out more of the flavor of the food fish or chicken for example than what we ve experienced with our previous toaster oven wow what an unanticipated plus we can smell and taste more of the subtle aspects of our food n nthe controls are a breeze and easy to adapt to the oven produces what i d call a professional grade result i really appreciate the thought and science that must have gone into engineering this product to enhance my cooking experience its got my glowing vote n ntip i saved the previous toaster oven s rack and crumb tray for potential future use turns out that it was an excellent idea a second rack affords the opportunity of baking twice the items as long as what you re baking can comfortable fit in between them the old bread crumb tray stainless steel is excellent for cooking anything that wo n t produce much liquid and can benefit from more open space cookies roasting vegetables burgers for example buying these items would probably cost 20 or so assuming you d be inclined to do so reuse and recycle i love it
4;40;7;0.8327774767633379;produces intense heat quickly i m not sure what these heating elements are made of but they get hotter much faster than the 50 oven i had before this one n nmaintains perfect temperature the heating elements do n t cycle on and off at full blast like cheaper ovens but vary their output depending on the proximity to the target temperature so instead of overshooting the set temperature by 10 15 degrees and then waiting to overshoot it again when it gets 10 15 degrees below it inputs just enough heat to maintain the correct temperature so repeated blasting is avoided when your cooking a large item this is a very good thing when on a cheap toaster oven the temp drops 20 30 degrees and is repeatedly blasted back up that makes it too easy to burn the top of something some reviewers have said they are happy to use this more than their full sized oven and the temperature control system in the cuisinart has a lot to do with it a regular oven has a large thermal mass to tamp down on big temperature fluctuations the metal walls are big enough to store up lots of heat and keep the temp consistent this oven does electronically what big ovens due with sheer mass by gradually parceling out heat as necessary so the temp stays consistent and that is why it does a comparable job n nthe convection feature heats up fried foods incredibly well evenly heating to make soggy breading crispy again without burning part of it before other parts get done i already described above how this oven s brain allows it to keep temp consistent for such a small oven the convection fan helps in another way it distributes heat all around the food to minimize local hotspots so the sides facing away from the heating elements get more even heat delivered by circulating air the air carries heat directed at the top and bottom redistributing it around the oven for more even heating also steam does n t rise to the top but instead gets blown around and quickly evaporated this is great for roasting nuts like almonds that are normally very easy to burn the heat is so even with the convection feature that i can use it to oven fry breaded chicken brushed with olive oil and get a nicely browned flavorful crust all around convection also takes about 30 less time to cook n nthe toaster part of this oven also works very well if the oven is already hot that is factored into the toasting time and fewer minutes are seen on the countdown timer for a particular level at first i thought this was a gimmick but it can reduce toasting time by more than half if the oven is fairly hot and actually works pretty consistently i find i can even toast frozen items and they come out crispy and will heat nicely through from the residual heat of the toasting if i leave them in there for 5 or 10 minutes afterward cuisinart s engineers must have spent a lot of time testing this thing n nthere is a tray below the bottom heating elements that can be pulled from the rear and it is the perfect size to wrap a sheet of aluminum foil around so any drips and burns are a cinch to clean up more than a year later the tray looks perfectly clean underneath n ni d recommend this oven to just about anyone my only complaint is the oven timer does n t seem to shut off the oven when it runs out it just continues to beep i ll have to look in the manual and see if i am doing something wrong but i do n t think i am this one negative is not much compared to the pluses of this oven though it excels where it counts and where most other products in this category do n t dare to go
5;81;19;0.8280006992727575;i love toast and make a lot of sandwiches of all with premium breads of all thick nesses and sizes as densities my wife likes heavy multigrain breads full of moisture which take forever to toast i like the light fluffy bread which toasts much quicker this toaster oven consistently performs well over this variety of toasts we like seeds on the bread exterior to toast enough to release their flavor this machine does that well too i read about 200 reviews of the leading toasters from many sources this toaster received some of the best reviews including but not often mentioned comments on toasting i had trouble making up my mind to spend so much on a toaster oven which would take a lot of counter space and be primarily used for toasting n ni had a 20 year old black decker which performed excellent but left it in my old house i needed a nice looking toaster for the new upgraded house since i am a toast addict i stooped to pick up a new black decker toaster oven at wal mart a store i hate to shop at because everything is junk the black decker dried and hardened the toast from the inside out so that when any sign of toasting occurred the bread was now as hard as a brick and as dry as powdered cement n ni purchased the cuisinart tob 165 from amazon and it arrived in a bigggg box in just a few days it installed flawlessly was toasting in extradinore mode without reading any instructions cuisinart tob 165 gives you a lot of intuitive control over toasting and the results are impressive i get rave reviews for my famous sandwiches and the ability to toast the outside of the bread while leaving the inside warm and chewy gives just the right touch to a sandwich the cuisinart tob 165 is heavy well build controls are easy to read easy for big fingers to adjust and thoughtfully placed n nadditionally we have used the cuisinart tob 165 to heat pizza to cook fish sticks and the assorted things a toaster broiler oven does i find that heating pizza first on convection and finishing off with broiling restores the pizza to much better than delivery condition n noh did i mention that i purchased a cuisinart 2 slice fat toaster for those few times when the bread was small or cooking a bagel it heats very quickly and just toasts the outside nothing more you have to watch that one like a hawk or it will burn i much prefer the results from the cuisinart tob 165 use it when i want the best results
6;48;65;0.8008211586446454;updated at the end of this review on november 28 2009 and again on november 8 2012 n nding ding ding cuisinart has a winner i have had this toaster oven for about a month now and have used every feature at least once including the baking of a pie n nthis cuisinart bakes and toasts evenly due to settings that work accurately i went for so long with an old unreliable welbilt toaster oven that it s hard to believe anything can be this easy to use or have results this perfect from a door that actually makes a good seal to the easy to figure out touch panel this oven has it all n nsome people complain about its small size why if you need a bigger oven you can use the stand up one in your kitchen this baby baked a 9 pie for me with room to spare it toasts 2 large bagels easily and i have also roasted chicken pieces and broiled a few small steaks it has many sought after features including convection baking i m only 4 10 tall and i ve been teased for my small size too so i understand where the toaster oven is coming from o n nno oven light is another complaint get a flashlight ray o vac sells them for about 4 99 please do n t let that stop you from buying this wonderful kitchen appliance i have not found its lightlessness no that is not a word to be a problem n nca n t say much about the long term reliability have n t had it long enough but for the length of time that i do have it i love it i love it i love it and use it daily n nis it more expensive than many others yes but it s worth every penny it looks sharp even in the white which is the color i chose it s a cuisinart i m a kitchenaid and cuisinart appliance snob and it works wonderfully n nif my husband ever throws me out the toaster oven comes with me n nupdate it is now november 28 2009 after over 4 1 2 years this toaster oven is still working absolutely flawlessly it is used on a daily basis and i still do n t have a single complaint about it i often use it in place of my full sized oven i remain completely happy with its performance and reliability n n2nd update november 8 2012 i ca n t believe that this toaster oven is still going strong after 7 1 2 years i want the same one in stainless but how can i give this one up if it s still working perfectly
7;9;83;0.7975827316033535;i ve owned at least 10 different toaster ovens over the years i ve had my cuisinart for about 2 years now it is by far the best one i ve ever owned it has n t discolored it still works just fine get a clue people toaster ovens are n t meant for baking nthis oven works quickly and evenly for roasting chicken and making baked potatoes it broils well it s so so like all toaster ovens for toast does a pretty good bagel nif you have to have a toaster oven that turns itself off with the timer get something else because this one just beeps but that s enough for me nthe convection feature really does speed up cooking and i love all the toast cycles such as bagel defrost 4 slices etc the rewarm button is handy as well nfor my money this toaster oven has the most features and is the most consistent it s not been a problem to clean either nbut geez make your wedding cake in a real oven the nature of a toaster oven is that with such a small cavity it s going to overbrown anything you attempt to bake i ve never owned a toaster oven no matter how big that baked well
8;99;64;0.7386871720990088;like many others here i owned black and decker toaster ovens which worked to varying degrees of ok to fire prone a kitchen necessity that i had to replace every couple years nafter debating about spending the extra money i decided to go for the cuisinart having read the great reviews here i am very happy that i did nit feels kind of like having a mercedes after owning a geo the oven works great for toast and bakes well the digital panel was easy enough to figure out even without reading the instructions nconsidering that i use it just about every day i can say it was money well spent and toasting is a pleasure i hope it has a long life too n nupdate august 2009 i m still getting good use from this toaster oven often i forego using my big oven and use this instead to roast a chicken i often use the convection oven feature which leaves things more moist nmaking toast does take longer in this than using a conventional toaster nreally money well spent
9;72;29;0.7172055299118391;i was a bit hesitant about buying a hundred dollar plus toaster oven but the reviews were great and i was sick and tired of the junk i have had in the past n nthe cuisinart tob 165 convection toaster oven broiler is a fantastic unit everything i have used it for has come out perfect n ni highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a toaster over it is well worth the extra money

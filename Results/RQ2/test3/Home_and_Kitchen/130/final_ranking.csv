0;54;67;0.8735523826779514;i have used centrifugal juicers for years or not used them cleaning the centrifugal juicers was a real pain and even though i loved juice i made juice less and less because of the cleaning process n ni purchased this masticating juicer about a year ago and it works beautifully i actually use it all of the time because to clean i just pop off the juicing assembly break it down to its components in the sink rinse off and store on my drying rack until next use usually the next day or two sometimes i have to wipe down the chrome motor housing that the assembly attaches to it s really just that simple to clean n n10 year warranty njuices veggies wonderfully with lots of juice njuices most fruits wonderfully too ncleans up really quickly and easily nruns quietly and smoothly nlooks good on my counter n10 year warranty n nnormally i do n t make so much juice at once but i currently have sick people in my home so last night i juiced about 8 oranges and one whole pineapple due to so much soft fruit i had to clean the screw twice during juicing due to stoppage i ve not had this problem with just oranges btw that was the most labor intensive juicing i have done in an entire year of use and i use it at the very least twice a week but sometimes 3 or 4 times a week 99 of the time running the soft fruits or veggies first and following up with harder ones works like a charm and that is no exaggeration n ni ve made some of the healthiest and tastiest juices just by throwing together a bunch of veggies i also made a veggie juice last night using an apple a lemon a small cube of ginger broccoli carrots tomatoes and celery no recipe just picked out some veggies i wanted delicious throw in a squirt of tabasco and make it a bit spicier if you like i have never made a juice i did n t like though that is probably possible n npomegranate juice do n t get me started on how good that is hint fill a large bowl with water break apart under water seeds sink peel and pith float strain juice drink happy dance n ni ve juiced beets carrots squash spinach cucumbers celery broccoli tomatoes turnips apples grapes pomegranates pineapple oranges lemons grapefruit pears and some i forgot n nthis is an easy fast solution to achieving better health for yourself and your family easy to use cleans up quickly cheaper than most of this type and a 10 year warranty if you re strictly a fruit juicer then you may and i stress may want to go centrifugal but veggies and fruits or just veggies you ca n t go wrong with this i would even use this for just fruits because the juice quality will be better and if you have to stop and clean the screw it wo n t take any longer to use this juicer than it would to use and clean up the centrifugal one when you re finished with it n ndo n t forget to put all of that pulp in your mulch pit you will have fat and happy earthworms who will make the best soil for your garden which recycles that unused pulp and puts it back into something you can eat or juice
1;40;93;0.8646328406797535;we have a very simple philosophy if an appliance is a pain in the hindparts to clean you ll dread using it the next time to that end we upgraded many of our appliances in our kitchen with both speed energy efficiency and easy cleanup priority specific to this review the omega 8005 juicer is almost perfect i paid with a email coupon via november 4 2008 n non top of our refrigerator is our hamilton beach big mouth juicer which is a centrifugal juicer strapped to a jet engine and leads you to believe its the kitchen version of a work shop bench grinder as are many high rpm centrifugal juicers i give my big mouth the one point i can not give the omega 8005 speed n nthe omega 8005 is a change of pace and requires a considerable amount of time with preparation of your fruit and vegetables which must be cut into smaller pieces to accomodate the chute that said with the exception of carrots which the big mouth does a better job the pulp is considerably drier but neither is it completely dry but nevertheless i was impressed at just how dry it is n napples oranges cranberries pomergrante arils ginger cucumbers ginger superior carrots very good pineapple good unripe to fresh poor over ripe n ni ve yet to use the pasta and nut butter attachments but i have made sorbets and every frozen fruit i ve ran through it from frozen strawberries to frozen bananas is superior n nthe omega 8005 has been exactly as many user reviews say it is and to those who have negative reviews with the exception of patience with prepping the food i have none n ncleanup is a dream no other way to put it i use the juicer twice a day and there is no comparison between this juicer and my big mouth not that the big mouth is a that bad if you clean the little devil up right away n nquality of juice i was surprised that there is some foaming but the mesh screen does what its suppose to and does separate foam from the juice there was no distinction between my big mouth and the omega when it came to carrots but everything else the comparisons definitely favor the omega 8005 n ni should note i own the black and chrome juicer and am aware there is no difference between the 8003 and 8005 mechanically other than aesthetics there s no secret that dark colored appliances are more forgiving to the eyes than white we have kid who shortcut their kitchen chores n nprice of the juicer is as of november 4 2008 is minimum at every website i searched i knew their were two websites that offered email rebates while doing my research a tip to those who use craigslist their were some very very good deals around the country but shipping handling made the difference between my purchase and it very little difference but if you can find the juicer in your backyard consider looking there n ni ca n t give the juicer a 5 rating it s not a cheap juicer but neither is it the most expensive and prep is n t for those who are impatient i do give the juicer a 4 5 if i could or a 9 on a scale of 10 n nthe 10 year warranty ease of cleaning and the style juicer it is and the variety of things you can do with it were the points which gave it the nod
2;8;116;0.8545108286748038;do n t drink the koolaid of the negative reviewers of this juicer such as s shrivastava do you want a design with blades such as the breville 800jexl that will dull with time or one that uses a tough dual stage single gear that s easy to clean n ni bought my omega juicer 8005 2 months ago off of ebay for 140 00 used only a few times n ni juice carrots mainly mixed in with apples oranges and grapes i play basketball every week and the energy boost i get from the carrot juice is tremendous n nthe juicer is extremely easy to clean i can clean all the parts in less than 3 minutes anyone claiming it s hard to clean is lazy or works for a competing brand or both n nyes you do have to cut the vegetables but so what i knew that when i bought it i buy the largest carrots and after cutting them up the omega juicer handles the pieces very easily i have never clogged up my juicer n nit is recommended that when juicing more than one kind of fruits and vegetables that you should feed half of the carrots first and then feed in whatever other vegetables or fruits and then finish with the last half of carrots to help get everything out n nthe juicer comes with two plastic catch basins one for the juice and one for the pulp and yes the basins will stain over time but so what i do n t leave them out on the counter anyway and yes if you are making more than about 24 oz of juice you will have to empty the catch basin of pulp before your finished i think i can handle a few steps to the trash can to empty this out n ni also juice for my wife and 3 of my kids and i do n t find it difficult at all the negative reviews are completely baseless and quite absurd n ni also have never tipped the juicer when utilizing the plunger to feed the vegetable parts the one reviewer who says they do obviously has n t read the instructions or is exaggerating beyond belief n nand contrary to the distortions of one reviewer the juice does not come out warm especially if your vegetables are kept in the refrigerator before use think about it how can a juicer that rotates at about 3 600 rpm omega warm something compared to a juicer that rotates at 13 000 breville rpms n nagain do n t drink the koolaid of the negative reviewers they have no clue what they are talking about n nbuy this juicer with confidence
3;18;121;0.8535167194153255;i bought this juicer back in december and i absolutely love it it takes seconds to assemble and take apart all the parts can go into the dishwasher clean up is super easy it just takes a few seconds to rinse each piece under running water there s one attachment that has two screens that have to be cleaned out and at first i thought it d take forever to get the pulp out of them but it does n t you just run the brush included over the screens a couple of times and they re clean the whole thing is really very simple n nmy other concern with this juicer was juicing leafy vegetables i was n t sure that they d juice well but they do i ve juiced romaine spinach parsley beet greens cabbage collard greens chard kale they all come out great in fact everything i ve juiced has come out great i ve juiced everything from canteloupe to beets to pineapple to carrots apples all citrus fruits celery garlic onions berries kiwi pears broccoli stems sprouts etc i ve also made nut butters with this machine n nthe juicer has never made a mess is pretty quiet and does n t take up a ton of counter space not any more than my toaster n ni saw a comment from someone else who said that the plastic stains easily when juicing beets and carrots i see how that could happen but what i do to stop that from happening is whenever i juice beets or carrots i simply soak the plastic parts mainly the pulp and juice containers in hot water for about five minutes as soon as i m finished making my juice as i said i ve had mine since december and there s not a stain anywhere on it if you rinse the parts when you re finished using them to make a dark colored juice they ll never get stains on them n ni have no complaints at all about this juicer it s true that the feeding chute is small and produce needs to be cut into smaller pieces before juicing i guess everything is a trade off i d rather spend the extra 5 minutes chopping than to have a machine that will break down on me is loud does n t juice as well produces warm juice due to high rotation or makes a mess on top of everything else this machine has a ten year warranty on all parts and labor you ca n t beat that n ni d recommend the omega 8005 to anyone who wants a high quality long lasting juicer
4;42;61;0.8513208894533819;i do n t think you can really compare the omega masticating auger juicer with the breville centrifugal juicer they are 2 different kinds of juicers n ni ve been a juicer for years i have both juicers it s the omega that stays on my counter and get used almost daily i use the breville when i want to do a lot of one thing like all apples or all carrots nbut mostly i use the omega because it is slower less oxidation and it cleans up faster than the breville and you can make nut butters soak some raw cashews and push through amazing and smooth or make my own tahini or grind up soaked dates and nuts and some raw cacao and make my own healthy raw candy the new vertical omega masticating juicer does n t make nut butters it says n ni prefer no pulp and with either juicer i always strain my juice through a nut milk bag a fine mesh cloth n many strain their juice during a healing juice fast for lightening the load on digestion n nsome people complained of the small opening and that you have to cut things up smaller to go through yes but when i make a quart of juice its a meal and you have to spend a little time making your meal i suppose i m used to it after using it all the time i put all my veggies in a bowl my favorite green juice kale ginger apple celery cucumber wash them cut the ones that need it juice it then use the same bowl to put the mesh bag in to pour the juice in squeeze and pour into a glass and yum n nomega slower and quieter and easy to clean easy to assemble and makes nut seed butters and wheatgrass juice nbreville faster and louder takes a little longer to clean and put back together nboth make great juice nbut i love my omega more n nwhat ever juicer you use you get a gold star for juicing
5;61;44;0.8448586650897739;i ve owned the omega j8005 juicer for about a week and am very pleased with it i ll update after i ve used it a while n npros very good w greens easy assembly and disassembly relatively quiet easy cleaning great warranty 10 years and looks n ncons slower at juicing than a centrifugal juicer does n t handle the really tough fruits like pineapple w skin have to cut the plants into small sizes to fit into the hopper slightly less juice from carrots and apples than my breville n nit s a masticating juicer which means it tears mashes and presses the plant matter with an auger to separate the juice and fiber i ve found that it provides more juice from leafy green veggies kale dandelion spinach etc than my breville elite 800jexl the omega is relatively quiet as well i can carry on a conversation or listen to the radio while juicing it cleans very easily some running water a quick brush around the parts with a little soap and a drain board is all i need the omega s assembly and disassembly are also very easy it takes about 10 15 seconds for videos of these juicers in action go to youtube and check out rawfood s videos btw i have n t yet used it for pasta or nut butters which apparently the omega can process n ngiven that it s a masticating juicer and not a centrifugal juicer one that has a very fast spinning blade plate that spins around and rips the plants apart it s slower at juicing compared to my breville it takes about 5 times as long to juice carrots and 4 times as long to juice greens like kale not only does the breville tear though the plants faster than the omega the hopper is also about 2 5 times the size so you can fit more in at a time and though it has a powerful motor the design of the omega is n t built to handle really tough plants like skin on pineapple n nin summary the omega will probably be my more used juicer because i prefer a heavily green juice it s easier to clean is quieter and i ll be more likely to just make a glass or two with it as the mood strikes me on the other hand i ll use the breville for when i want to juice larger quantities and or use harder tougher veggies fruits n nadvice if you want more greens and softer fruits veg make smaller quantities 8 32 oz at a time live in a space where you need really quiet then the omega may be a better option however if you really like carrot apple turnip pineapple juice and or want to make a couple liters for the day then a centrifugal juicer like the breville may be a better option n nhere s to your health
6;56;17;0.8435864393248867;i ve owned this juicer for about a year it is the best juicer i ve ever had for juicing leafy greens and green juices are where it s at n nthere is no such thing as the perfect juicer for all juicing jobs and do n t listen to anyone who says there is i own an inexpensive citrus juicer a centrifugal juicer for soft fruits such as melons and i have this one for juicing my leafy greens it juices all your greens herbs wheat grass so efficiently n nhowever this baby also juices apples pears beets carrots ginger peppers cucumber celery and fennel anything firm like a champ n nthe chute is a little smaller in diameter than some other juicers so i have to cut apples pears cucumbers and beets into more narrow pieces to get them down the chute but it s a small price to pay for the easy cleanup i ca n t tell you how easy this baby is to clean it comes with a heavy duty toothbrush looking tool that is used to scrub the small screen clean in a flash n nusing this juicer makes me want to juice the slower masticating design gives a higher juice yield and the super easy clean up is worth mentioning again it comes with everything you need including 2 nice size containers to catch the juice with another screen which screens out any foam which is a nominal amount and the dry pulp tip put a produce bag in the pulp container for an even easier clean up and what you re left with is no foam juice my containers are not made of cheap materials i do n t put them in the dishwasher i wash them by hand immediately after juicing and i ve never had a problem n ni ve also used the blank side to make ice cream using frozen bananas and strawberries yum you can also make nut butters but i m losing weight and nut butter are n t currently on my diet plan ca n t wait until they are n nsuper smart design the 15 year warranty on this baby for the price you ca n t beat it n nupdate it s now 2014 and i m still using it all the time still love it it runs like a champ and is still great for green juicing and we re still making the frozen banana and strawberry soft serve ice cream
7;87;18;0.835492786019264;i ve owned this juicer for about 6 weeks now and have juiced fruits in it and many many vegetables and it has juiced everything that i ve fed into it albeit not all with the same effeciency if you are looking for a juicer to juice leafy greens this is your machine it will eat through kale lettuce spinach with a vengence the pulp is dry and the juice is good this machine also shines with harder root vegetables as well like carrots n nwhere it struggles is with softer fruits and vegetables i juice a lot of cucumber however if i do n t push through the occasional celery stalk it will start to back up the same thing occurs with softer fruits i did try juicing some oranges in it which it did juice however i would have been better off cutting the oranges in half and squeezing them into a glass if you push through some more fibrous stuff while you are juicing the softer fruits and vegetables you wo n t have any problems n none last thing this juicer does produce a good amount of pulp it comes with a strainer which i use while i am juicing however because of this it does slow down the process a bit when it becomes clogged i do though because i do n t like much pulp in my vegetable juice on the plus side it does n t produce much foam n nregarding setting up and cleaning it takes very little time i can have it set up and juicing in under a 30 seconds while it takes me around 5 7 minutes to clean everything after i have finished n nall in all i am very happy with the machine it seems very sturdy and solidly built and comes with that 10 year warranty which brings a bit of consumer confidence to the table
8;28;15;0.8252867135867679;this is an excellent juicer for green vegetable juice fruits do n t juice very well the fruit pulp will tend to clog the screen and you will have to stop and rinse the screen it will remove a good amount of juice from fruit but it is a chore because it will not juice fruit very well is the reason i gave it only 4 stars that is a con another con is the feed tube size it is only a little over 1 inches in diameter i have found if i julienne all the hard veggies and chop all the leafy greens and mix it all together before i feed it through it works much better those are the cons and what prevents this juicer from being a 5 star because let me tell you how wonderful the juice is if you go through that little bit of work nif prepped properly the veggies go through without problem and no clogging i can make a gallon of green juice without cleaning the screen i buy all my produce and make my juice the same day yielding the freshest and highest quality juice this juicer produces very little foam and minimal oxidization occurs when i store it in mason jars for 3 days i even drank the last jar on the fourth day and it tasted fine the flavors mellow as it ages probably not a good thing but i can tell it still packs a very nutritional punch even after 3 days in the fridge i do this because i am a full time student and i work part time juicing every fourth day saves me so much time it takes me less than 3 hours to wash prep juice and clean up my machine and mess ni am taking in so many servings and varieties of vegetables i would normally never consume my green juice recipe includes cucumber celery carrots parsley spinach kale chard watercress asparagus apple and lemon i was sure it was going to taste nasty but i love it it is very energizing like a natural energy drink ni have lost 22 lbs in 16 days eating mostly raw vegetable and fruit i have more energy and i feel healthier i am convinced this is a much better way to live by being an example for my girlfriend she is now starting to juice my kids even try my juice but prefer the fruit juices if you are interested just check out youtube and you will find tons of help ni bought the breville blender on amazon for my fruit i make fresh fruit smoothies with almond milk in the blender and juice my veggies so far it has been an amazing journey and i invite you to try it out yourself
9;76;83;0.8244159002758299;i researched juicers for months before taking the plunge i had the money saved up for a greenstar but the ease of cleaning ultimately drove me to the omega the cost savings was just a bonus n ni read the review about plastic shavings getting into the juice but after seeing the machine i realized that even if that was happening which it does n t it would only take a couple revolutions and then the plastic would be shaved down to the point of not touching the metal and therefore not getting in the juice any longer my auger does n t in any way touch the metal so this is certainly not a problem that is consistent with this juicer n nyes the only drawback is that you have to cut most produce an extra slice thinner but you more than make up for that in your clean up time it is a little slow compared to something like a breville but juice comes out without much foam and nutrients intact it takes about 10 seconds to clean the whole shebang and that in itself motivates me to juice more often n nour daily juice looks something like 2 carrots 1 apple a head of romaine 1 cucumber a cutting of wheatgrass 1 zucchini and then we end with a few sticks of celery to pull it all through we have all types of produce in our morning juice and it handles it all like a champ
10;46;12;0.7715686138641622;oooooooooo mega j8005 five five five five nthe greatest greatest greatest greatest juicer juicer juicer juicer ever ever ever ever ever n nsince joe cross and phil staples convicted me of my fatitiude in fat sick and nearly dead i ve felt overwhelmed about being in the shape i find myself round and thought man i got ta do that juice fast diet and change my fat habits n nso i broke down and bought a juicer n nbut not just any juicer no no i bought the omega j8005 five five five five i m pretty sure when you say it it s supposed to boom and echo for a minute n ntook it outta the box and the first thing i noticed after the angels stopped singing was how securely it was packaged nfirst the shipping carton was the perfect size and shape for the retail carton inside nsecond inside the retail carton the omega j8005 five five five five was expertly packaged every single piece and part was bubble wrapped and securely placed in the box ntaking it out and laying out all the pieces i was thrilled to find it looked exactly like the unit in all of the you tube videos that previous owners had made that i watched to decide upon buying this one n nit went together with zero difficulty nseriously zero difficulty if you have problems assembling this thing stop immediately and call someone smarter than you to do it you are doing it wrong nthis thing is nearly idiot proof nalso as an added bonus the instruction manual is very clear to understand and for those of you who attended missouri public school like me has plenty of great pictures for step by step instructions n nthere are four thousand and one reasons a nutritionist dietician m d or one of your friends who has been juicing for 10 years might tell you to buy a different brand or kind of juicer they have really good reasons nutrient content enzymes temperature of juice and such but for me it boiled down to this na vitamix costs as much as a kidney or an appendage nthe juicer joe and phil use in the movie was 100 more than this one nthe omega j8005 five five five five was less expensive than the high end juicers more expensive than the cheapest omega juicers and had 300 positive reviews out of 330 or so guess what trigger pulled and with prime i got it here before i ordered it so fast n nnow i m juicin it up awwww yeah n ni stuffed it full of three bunches of kale and some celery this baby was begging for more that s right i juiced i juiced good and long and nearly keeled over from a huge tummy ache and even though i was so into cramming every last solitary veggie from my crisper into my brand spankin new omega j8005 five five five five and seeing how well it worked i did two bad things i let the juice container overflow which holds four cups up to the tippy tip top and i ran the juicer for i dunno like a hour straight which if you re an instruction manual reader you would know is big no no because it says 30 minutes continuously max n ni love my juicer i do n t care who knows it i do n t care if your juicer runs faster longer jumps higher and can run for more than 30 minutes according to its manual my juicer rocks n ni m very satisfied n noh and it also makes noodles nso if i lose a g jillion pounds and can have spaghetti again i m gon na mash up some sauce and have you all over for an italian feast n not really
11;17;7;0.722037921129658;darn i ordered this juicer the omega j8005 may 18 2015 received it 9 days later and it broke the next day on its maiden voyage juicing a little wheat grass after throwing away several days worth of grass i received a new replacement part the screen and used it for a couple of weeks before it broke again same part so i decided to return it yet now amazon informs me that the return window has closed for this product as of yesterday june 27 thus my opening exclamation n nthere s something seriously wrong with this juicer which is weird because i had an omega j8003 several years ago and it worked very well using what appears to be the same part to bad i sold it to a friend n nand yes i know what i m doing no way am i overfeeding the chute i never even used the plunger to squessh it down just hand fed it a little at a time the part is clearly defective or maybe its the barrel that is not holding the screen tight enough and letting it expand until it cracks the sound it makes when self destructing is obvious n nmaybe they will send me another one still i wish i had bought something else maybe another 8003 either way i m greatly disappointed with amazon for having only a 30 day return window that begins on the day you bought it instead of the day you received it that s just outrageous nshame on amazon com
12;84;9;0.6971808641446149;just buy the blendtec blender instead and save yourself the headache that this juicer gives you you re looking at about 35 50 mins to prepare juice and clean up the feed chute is has to small of an opening to get your vegetables in there the catch containers are small so you ll end up constantly draining and throwing away mulch the motor gets the juicer hot not sure if this is good or bad but it s annoying this beast is heavy as hell and takes up too much space and lastly there are too many pieces n ni wanted this juicer for two years and was very disappointed with the amount of work you got ta put in to get some juice it s annoying very annoying n ncheck out the blendtec juicer when i saw the demonstration at cotsco my mind was blown at the simplicity compared to these other juicers i m in the middle of returning the omega one because i ve been using my blendtec juicer and having a great time n nsorry for the rant but for 300 i was really unimpressed with the omega
13;1;5;0.690463499892205;i used to have an acme centrifugal juicer i thought i would never like any juicer better than the acme because it made good juice and was very easy to clean the only drawback to a centrifugal juicer is it wo n t extract much juice from leafy green vegetables and wo n t juice wheatgrass ni got this omega 8005 juicer because i wanted to be able to juice greens and wheat grass as well as root vegetables i read on a forum that this new omega juicer is the best there is for under 400 this omega juicer is even easier to clean than the acme which is a big issue because in the long run you wo n t use a juicer if its a hassle to clean and it squeezes all the juice out of anything i put in it the pulp comes out very dry it is super quiet too and the acme was loud nthe omega runs at a low rpm so it does n t kill enzymes and stuff like that so its supposed to make healthier juice than a champion or centrifugal juicer nits a pleasure to use i make juice every day now i love getting all the nutrients that i need regularly it helps my body recover from surfing everyday nthe juicer is very well built and very simple it seems like it will last a long time and it has a very long warranty nyou can tell that i love this juicer eh n nedit it s now 2009 and i ve had this juicer almost five years i still use it just about every day i still love it the juicing screen started to wear out a few months ago i emailed omega and they sent me a new one for free they certainly stand by their 10 year warranty i am comforted to know that if anything else should happen i still have five more years of no questions asked replacement

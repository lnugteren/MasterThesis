0;26;73;0.890171790618564;i really love this desk i bought it in black and it fits in well with my other espresso colored wood furniture in the room since i am using it in my dining living room i opted to mount it a little higher than recommended so that i could transfer a dining chair to the desk when working on the computer i chose this desk because the location where i wanted to place it in my combo room splits between tile and carpet and a non floating desk would not sit level in that location i did n t even know that floating desks were an option when i stumbled upon this desk and it serves its purpose well n nmy husband a mechanic was able to put it together and mount it on the wall by himself in less than an hour it comes with a bracket that mounts to the wall and it fits onto the bracket for easy mounting and removal the center section of the desk fits our 27 imac perfectly but we had to forego the additional moulding that fits across the top of this section designed to hide the mounting bracket from view no problem though because the monitor fits so perfectly that it hides the bracket anyway there is a box under the desk portion in the back which holds a surge protector and hides it from view since we did n t have an outlet directly behind the desk we simply drilled a hole in the side of the desk to run the cord through for the plug n nthe desk was very slightly damaged during shipping it got a small scratch on one of the large wing panels on the side but it came with a wood pen and after a quick touch up it looked fine i would recommend this desk to anyone
1;16;50;0.8810801975753043;very solid wall desk for sizing the newer thinner 2012 27 inch imac will fit in the main opening perfectly with just a bit of room on each side i did take the top middle section finishing piece that hides the wall rail and leave it off i did n t leave it off because i needed room for the imac but i put the piece on the bottom just on top of the aluminum stand to hide the cables as simple as that nothing more to buy past that there is a box to keep the power strip and excess cable i used that for a power line conditioner and a power strip with the power adapters that power my accessories basically this is the cleanest look that i could get for my setup n nnow for the potential deal killer for some keep in mind that this is a fairly heavy desk the desk is very solid but your wall may not be it comes with 3 screws to mount to wood studs i did not think about this i usually have metal studs which there is a work around but not where i mounted it because i think that satan himself must have designed the building they mounted the drywall to bricks i decided to take this as a plus and got concrete brick anchors basically specific screws i got the set from buildex tapcon that came with the correct drill bit in the box to minimize issues it was about 17 after blindly drilling away a few did not hold that is because i hit mortar no problem just drill another hole an inch or two away i used about 10 screws total which should net me over 500 pounds of holding power n nthis unit literally has a rail single piece of metal that you mount to the wall then place the unit onto that that s it nothing else holds it while i was putting it up i was fairly unsure but once i got it up to it the rest was easy i had to pound the desk down to seat it properly in the rail system word of advice i now know back the screws up just a bit and do n t tighten fully until the unit is in place then tighten the screws after it is up the way that it is designed lets you have access to the screws while it is up as long as the screws do n t magically back out of the brick this will never come down accidently fyi in the manual they recommend only to mount this on wood studs n nbasically it is particle board and mdf the mdf is the main desk surface which reduces vibrations unlike my ikea piece covered by thicker black veneer it is similar to how flat pack furniture was made before ikea it is more solid than almost any ikea piece today they are a canadian company and seem to make better stuff than even higher priced items it was packed so well that there was multiple spots of damage on the box but not to the product that said i do wish they had a solid wood model option even if it was a higher cost but this is the best wall mounted desk i could find and the price is very good for what you get would purchase again
2;77;57;0.8405791178834053;this fit perfectly in a small unused corner of my living room now i can computer in warmth next to the fire in the living room instead of in the siberia of the bedroom if you have a cordless drill driver and an open space of about 8 x8 you can put this together in about an hour and a half i was even able to hang it on the wall by myself by balancing it on my office chair and rolling it into position then raising and lowering the seat height until it was just right that part would have definitely been easier with two people though it does n t have a lot of extra storage space obviously but all i needed was a spot to put my all in one computer with wireless keyboard and mouse and for that it s perfect i did have to use the jigsaw to make the opening in the shelf below about one inch wider to fit a small apc ups 550g the shelf was designed for a power strip only but after widening the opening the battery back up fit perfectly now to sweep or vacuum i just wheel the chair out of the way and go no legs or cords in the way i love it
3;11;45;0.8370965291435911;did a lot of researching before finally deciding on buying this desk after reading all the comments i was afraid of getting the wrong color or have missing parts but all my worries disappeared when i opened up the box everything was there and even had extra parts left over my small desk i had in my bedroom took up too much room years ago i had purchased a floating shelf and loved it i finally found the desk to match looks like they were made for each other put the desk high enough so the arms of my chair fits underneath and if i wanted to stand it would n t be too awkward now my whole area is compact but yet have plenty of room for stuff i put the desk together by myself and it was kind of hard for me but after several attempts i got it together two people is needed to hang unless you a strong person it took a while to get used to the desk because i had the sensation it may fall in my lap it s been two weeks now and i am already used to the height the only con i have is that the depth of 19 is almost not enough space for a monitor and keyboard but this will only help me to keep the desk clutter free
4;69;25;0.82423616932118;i like the desk it opened up some space in the alcove that i use for my desktop the alcove is small and was formerly used to house an organ by the previous home owner i did have to modify the vertical space on the left end of the desk to allow me to put my computer tower it was a bit too narrow i repositioned the vertical piece and shortened the horizontal piece in the center i have a great deal of experience in woodworking and furniture design if you have a computer without a tower no problem nassembly took about two hours without my personal modification i suggest using a power screwdriver and a nut driver with a proper allen wrench bit i also used a rubber hammer to seat the pieces that cover the mounting hardware do n t use a steel hammer you ll damage the formica veneer nthe overall design is solid and braced well to prevent it racking off square it went together with no problems i bought some storage cubes at a dollar store to add some storage for disks paper etc that you need for the computer it also has my printer on top of the cube because there s no room for the printer on the desk overall i m pleased especially when you consider the price i could n t build it myself for that price
5;41;69;0.8215234659219834;this desk is pretty fabulous it did take a little while to get here even though is is prime but i ca n t hold that against it n nit arrived with all the pieces including hardware and instructions and took me about an hour to put together working on it casually i was n t setting out to break any installation records nothing is labelled or marked however so once i opened up the box i did have to go through and check off each piece as it was listed to ensure i did have everything it also comes with a furniture marker in case you make any scratches during assembly which i thought was very cool n nit comes with a metal bracket that attaches to three studs in your wall with some heavy duty screws once the bracket is installed on the wall the desk simply hooks on to the bracket it is amazingly sturdy it is listed not to exceed 100lbs which is an amazing amount of weight for a desk to hold n nit does n t looks cheap or chintzy it looks like a nice piece of furniture i appreciate the top shelf as i am able to put a lamp up there that illuminates the whole surface of the desk rather than a lamp in one corner of the work surface
6;19;18;0.7890226555217893;this was an awesome idea for my daughters room as she needed a bigger floor footprint since buying new and bigger bedroom furniture i love the size of the desk the amount and placement of the cubbies and that is it big but not to big it was fairly simple to hang a little heavy but not that bad however when i received the desk i found that the parts were not all there i was able to hang it missing a nut for the main hanging bracket and affix the cover board missing 2 plastic pegs of the 3 needed that hides the hanging hardware i had to jerry rig until the manufacturer sends the missing hardware parts this is not long enough to be able to use all 3 hanging screws as it comes 3 inches shy of a standard studded wall so make sure you double screw 2 screws right next to each other in the same stud it if only using 2 studs or it will feel a little less stable n so 1 no star for the missing hardware and 1 no star for the fact that it does not secure the hanging bracket to the hanging bar so if you were underneath it cleaning and bumped it hard enough it could lift off the hanging bar and fall on you
7;76;42;0.7867404800283525;i like the desk it takes up so much less room than my old one and i can get under it easy to pick up things that fall or to clean the floor the bad part is it is a 2 man job to put it up and i found out the builder did not put the studs in where they were supposed to be i put a paper chalk board in back on the wall i even found a stool that fit perfect and is the same color but not on amazon
8;33;29;0.7268741376781674;desk was an easy install and looks great i love it it saves a lot of space and yet still has enough room to get things done n nonly bad thing is once its hanging up it s hard to get the cables to come in and out of the small space in the back of the desk meant to hide everything so if you add things to it afterwards it s a pain to get the new cords inside
9;10;41;0.7048999560165845;i really like this desk it opens up the floor underneath my desk and makes it looks so clean the cords are kept hidden away and tidy i put mine in a corner where a normal desk makes it seem so dark but this desk brightens it up and is very functional there is a short horizontal piece behind where you keep the monitor you can see it in the pictures and this covers part of the hanging system but i have found it very useful by purchasing peel and stick dry erase board and attaching it so that now it s a mini dry erase area great for little notes and inspirational quotes
10;23;38;0.6992614518109845;the desk is cheap but when comes in it is very nice wood and comes with everything needed to make it even look nicer i have gotten so many compliments over it after putting it in my room the only annoying thing was finding the studs to hook it up to but other than that the desk came so nicely and it is incredibly convenient to use and looks modern so many benefits with not dealing with desks that have broken legs or the space to put it or someone always walking by and kicking it accidentally this is just hooked on and good to go
11;45;11;0.6745057694579528;this desk is really tiny for an adult to work on the side compartments will only fit small accessories so do n t expect to take out the shelves and put in your tower there s no easy way to add speakers to this desk unless you have really long auxiliary cords n ncheap non solid wood the paint is already coming off where my i use my mouse i think i ve only used it for a month my parents sell furniture so judging from the material you would get expect to get something much nicer for the price range i m waiting for a more a well known company to manufacture this style of desk so i can replace it n nthe three stars are for style it does look pretty on your wall i just wish it was bigger
12;15;33;0.6559876224407865;my fiance and i go to school and deal with a lot of paperwork we used the laptop on the couch and bed but after a while it got uncomfortable so we decided to get a desk after browsing thru a few options we came across this one modern look and wall mount we just finished redecorating and this was exactly the perfect fit our only problem was how were we going to mount this but we took a chance and ordered it anyway the package arrived fast nothing missing and everything was in excellent condition it was fairly easy to assemble the instructions go thru everything you have to do step by step when it came to the actual mounting we had a minor set back we had no stud finder but no big deal we ordered one on amazon for less then 10 nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href ch hanson 03040 magnetic stud finder dp b000ikk0oi ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 ch hanson 03040 magnetic stud finder a nbsp the instructions recommended mounting the desk on three studs but where the desk would look perfect we only found two so we took the chance and set it up we have had the desk set up for a month or two and no problems its very sturdy and we are pleased with it we also bought a track light that sits right under the top shelf for night uses nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href ritelite lpl704 battery operated 12 led under cabinet track light dp b000r9p4ge ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 ritelite lpl704 battery operated 12 led under cabinet track light a nbsp our desk is mounted right next to one of our 55 gallon fish tanks and i love looking over at it while working
13;35;31;0.5950181049875873;this unit has made a huge difference in our home office did not realize just how crowded we were until we installed the desk one side of our office now looks great so much so that i just ordered a second unit to clear up the other side n nassembly can be a bit taxing but they tell you up front that this is a two person job pay very close attention to the different types of bolts used throughout the assembly the parts description is very detailed and if you put everything together as instructed you will have no parts left over assembly time for two fairly intelligent folks is about 90 minutes if you have questions there are videos and tech support to take you through it very well supported product n nphoto attached is moments after install still organizing
14;17;9;0.40502550916552066;great desk do yourself a favor before hanging it go to home depot for a couple of heavy duty hex screws the provided screws were n t strong enough to drive into the stud and broke we mounted it higher and bought a counter height bar stool my teen loves her new study area
15;55;12;0.34640452933191307;sturdy functional and neat design arrived quickly and decentently priced has a hidden shelf area for cords the top shelf is wide enough for office supplies not wide enough for things like a printer though

0;36;18;0.8141100767146513;i had n t bought any revere ware copper bottom pans for about 30 years and the new generation is quite different the material is lighter weight and cooks well and the handle and knob on the lid do n t get hot at all but the downside is it needs a lot more care the pan had to be washed and seasoned rubbed with cooking oil before it could be used and they recommend you season it again from time to time unlike with the older pans now you have to wait until the pan cools off before putting water in it and the manual warns that if you put the lid on while lowering the heat a dangerous vacuum could form and you ca n t risk taking off the lid yourself but have to contact the manufacturer talk about inducing paranoia n nall copper bottom revere ware pans need copper polish to make them spiffy but now this one needs non abrasive steel polish to get rid of the rainbow effect heat induced discoloration that forms in the bottom of the pan i m beginning to think my new pan requires more care and maintenance than my cat even so i do like the way it cooks
1;10;43;0.8073475873877936;i was happy to find this item for sale but it is of such poor quality that i am returning it the bottom is so thin that the stamp shows through to the inside and it is also raised to the touch you can pop the bottom in and out with very little pressure it looks much like the one i bought in the 1990s but the quality is very inferior i feel that the claim of even heat distribution is false disappointing for corning n nall the good reviews seem to be from 2005 and earlier
2;39;33;0.7761432916286072;the seller was quick and purchase arrived in excellent shape however i was disappointed with the product not the seller i ordered this saucepan as a replacement for an old revere ware pot i had for a long time the difference between the old one and the new one is obvious the new revere ware is not as sturdy or as heavy as the original pot it feels like a thinner pot with less copper on the bottom so would i buy revere ware again probably not that s a shame it used to be such a good name in cookware
3;26;21;0.7728138882892522;my first revere ware 3 quart sauce pan is still perfect after twenty years of daily use i love it so i decided to buy another to have a second the new one came immediately on time thanks amazon it was almost visually identical to the older one but the inside finish was not smooth like my older model it was clearly turned giving it grooves like an old phonograph record the new one immediately warped on my glass top stove so no good i ca n t use anything but perfectly flat cookware on glass top stove gas stoves probably ok except those grooves are bound to be harder to clean than the perfectly smooth stainless steel of my old one i tried to find the revere ware s customer service on the internet i think it is a brand of world kitchen now it seems evident to me that the new version is not as good i e more cheaply made than the original the manufacturer has either intentionally or unintentionally let a wonderful product s quality deteriorate the new pan was manufactured in indonesia i will be wary of poor quality in revere ware products in future shopping i would recommend avoiding all revere ware for everyone amazon com however was great i had a return shipping label ready since it came with the pot and amazon immediately credited my account for this crummy product yea amazon com is great i just wish there was a way to vet products beforehand
4;23;42;0.770020729575075;this is a very light weight pan with a lid that does n t fit i washed it just out of the box and left it to dry in the rack water spots lifted the copper plating from the bottom surface exposing whatever the next layer of coating is i then boiled water in it on my glass top range and the pan wobbled across the range top the bottom surface is n t flat burned my hand on all of the steam escaping from under the lid revere should be ashamed of this product manufactured in indonesia
5;22;20;0.7581700134646857;as a great many other reviewers i grew up with revere pots and pans in the house though not the copper clad most of the pots and pans we had growing up had been around so long the handles were falling off or the phenolic knobs handles pitted from much use and still they were the ones we used yes the new version is made over seas no nothing will ever be as good as the memories of childhood how can anything be as good as our mothers cooking that being said this product was exactly as i was expecting it came well packaged without any perceivable damage the bottom as well as the rest of the pan appear to be of acceptable thickness and quality of material the lit fits uniformly no it will not be a snug fit but revere has never claimed to have a lid that seals if i had wanted that i would have bought a pressure cooker the copper bottom will visibly rainbow as all copper products do you will have to take special care and use a stainless steel copper cleaner such as kleen king to remove the discoloration i have such a cleaner already that i use for the sink use it every time you wash your pan and you will always have a shiny copper bottom worthy of display
6;32;16;0.7346397055183159;the saucepan functions very well some reviewers do n t like that it is lightweight and not made in the usa but those factors do n t bother me since the pan does what i need it to do i ve wanted revere ware since i got married 39 years ago but someone gave me a nice set of farberware then i changed to an expensive non stick set three years ago however it was heavy took a long time to heat up and did not stack well in my cupboard i found myself using my mom s 65 year old revere ware saucepan which i received when she passed away more and more instead of the nonstick pans i finally decided to treat myself to a set of revere and i added this saucepan to round out the set true these pans are a lot lighter than mom s revere ware but they cook just as effectively i love that the pans are lightweight because i have arthritis in my arms wrists and hands i also like the revere warranty i had a warranty issue with one pan in the set i bought and the company replaced it within a few days i periodically make the copper bottoms of the pans shiny again by coating them with ketchup and letting it sit for a few minutes then rinsing works great
7;46;41;0.7001496654902531;at least one of the reviews referred to the heat conductivity of the copper bottom pot uh wrong the thin flash of copper on the revere pots is for appearance s sake if you want smooth even heat you have to find the pots with the aluminum disk bonded to the bottom several years ago consumer reports did a piece on this with thermographs of the bottoms of the different types of pot if you re interested and in particular if anyone wants to argue the merits of revere s copper coated pots it ll take some digging but it s worth it nrepeat copper bottom stainless is worthless for evening the heat
8;30;13;0.6784919688155767;this pan is lighter weight 1 5 oz than the older one we own the older one weighs 12 375 oz the new one weighs 10 875 oz on the outside of the old pan there s a distinct joint or edge where the copper bottom meets the stainless section on the new one the copper part looks almost like a thin coating of copper or just copper color was applied n ni ve used both to heat milk for oatmeal it s much easier to burn the milk when using the new one i m not thrilled with it the reason i bought the new one was so my cooking process would be the same regardless of which pan is available to me that does n t appear to be possible with the new pan bummer
9;14;11;0.5832556413473973;ideal choice of saucepan n ndo n t worry about the one star reviews they almost scared me out of ordering this pan looks like the real mccoy has a 25 year warranty and of course you do not turn the heat up all the way with care the pan should be very serviceable and just what i wanted thank you revere for still having metal lids we had a glass lid from another brand blow up on us so i am banning glass lids from my kitchen for safety reasons the 3 quart covered saucepan is just perfect for our revere steamer especially made for it so not replacing the pan was not an option also we find revere washes beautifully in the dishwasher when someone not me burns food on it comes clean with sos or stainless cleaner unlike many other brands that have been destroyed in our kitchen so i heartily recommend this product even for beginner cooks

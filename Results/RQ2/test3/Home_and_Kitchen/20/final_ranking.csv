0;13;18;0.7977995052898548;i bought this whisk because my old one finally broke 2 of the wires popped out when i was browsing for a new one i did n t really know how the whisk was measured this one is the 11 inch model but i did n t know from what to what was included in that measurement now i know the measurement is from one end to the other tip and not just the metal part for anybody else who might be in the dark about this i am thrilled with this whisk i also have a silicon covered whisk which is not so great especially when stirring pudding that you have to stir forever i am not a fan of the instant no stir type that silicon covered whisk leaves a thick coat of pudding sludge on the bottom of my pan because it is n t actually scraping the pan like a metal one i like that these wires are shaped in an elongated manner instead of a more puffed out shape it seems to get the job done very well i guess my old whisk was really junky but this one is great also the rubber handle is comfortable to hold i do n t find the length too long either something that is actually an issue as i am a petite person short and long cooking tools are too difficult to deal with
1;3;17;0.7908438888545453;not only is this my favorite whisk it is truly well made while making a custard filling for caramel eclairs you know those magical eclairs in the simply irresistible movie i found that the balloon shape and the way the wires adapt themselves to the shape of a saucepan was highly desirable n nfor one thing you do n t want any clumping in a sauce or custard and things do tend to get clumpy if you ca n t get into the inner edge of a saucepan with a bit of pressure you can whisk into every inch of a saucepan this is not always possible with a plastic whisk which is definitely not as flexible n nthe handle on this whisk makes it easy to keep a grip and oxo is known for their ergonomic considerations i think of it as an almost suede rubber that is not only comfortable to hold it allows your hand to grip the handle more firmly n nnow the reason the 10 stainless steel wires are so sturdy is because they are sealed into the base with a clear resin material this also prevents food from building up and i throw this whisk in the dishwasher without fear n nif you bang the wires against your hand you can see how sturdy this whisk is and i can almost imagine that somewhere in the world someone is using this whisk as a musical instrument n nwhen the cookbook says whisk this is the one i d highly nrecommend n n the rebecca review
2;18;15;0.6981062404596892;i love all the oxo good grips kitchen utensils because they are so comfortable to use i use this little 9 whisk a lot for small jobs it is perfect for mixing up a little thickening for gravy whisking a few eggs to use in recipes when baking or for scrambling eggs a larger whisk wo n t fit in measuring cups or small bowls n nsince i have arthritis in my hands i find the oxo good grips kitchen utensils to be the most comfortable on the market one little bit of advice is to rinse the whisk immediately after using to make clean up easier i made the mistake of letting food dry on it a couple of times and it made cleaning it more difficult i highly recommend this whisk for all cooks
3;8;6;0.6003479971544987;all oxo products are a dream to use so the whisk was a very welcome addition to my kitchen stash the handle is so comfortable that it makes each and every whisking job a breeze the only reason i give it four stars rather than five is the fact that i have difficulty cleaning the small ripples on the handle

6;5;11;0.5236882151610939;this is a good little whisk but is smaller than i expected i thought the wire spindles were 9 long but the utensil is 9 long from tip to tip the small 9 whisk is still good for limited applications like scrambling eggs and mixing salad dressings

0;12;94;0.9287198688820437;i ve had this coffee maker for about a year now given the wide variety of opinions i thought i d contribute my 02 n npros n n it really makes good coffee n ni m scratching my head at the reviews who say the coffee is weak n nthe grinding chamber is admittedly a bit small for those who like a lot bolder cup than i do i have no problem brewing my standard amount 8 cups of coffee at 1 heaping tablespoon of beans per cup for a total of 8 heaping tablespoons this is very standard and to me produces a very flavorful coffee the grinding chamber can probably handle about 12 heaping tablespoons but not much more than that some may find this ratio weak and if they brew 10 cups they may not be happy about the lack of grinding room n ni have never tried to make small pots of coffee due to the thermal carafe keeping the coffee warm all day and extraction efficiency usually being higher from what i know with larger batches so maybe there are some issues in the 1 4 cup mode n nnote i always grind my coffee home roast these days and i always use the included gold filter i do not know the result of not using the grinder or using standard paper filters i do n t use the timer either so i ca n t comment on how that works n n the thermal carafe really works well provided that you fill the thermal carafe with piping hot water from your faucet and use that to brew it will keep coffee hot for several hours without going into burnt territory this is idea for me it means i can brew a very large pot that will last the entire day if needed n n ground coffee is messy but i ve never seen a case where it is n t i ve wondered how many of the reviewers have dealt with grinding beans before ground beans oily gummy particles i ve personally found this an easy machine to clean for a raw bean machine most of the parts are dishwashable and the fact that they seperate out makes it easy to scrub the raw oils off if you want about the only parts i do n t dishwash are the carafe itself which i ve found a good oxygen based cleaner does well on if needed and the gold filter the machine itself only needs mild cleaning every now and then n ncons n n the grinder is loud well i have n t had a grinder that does n t have high volume personally but it s definitely something it would be nice to see more engineering on to quiet down n n there are a lot of parts to deal with the part list may seem daunting a grinder basket grinder lid coffee basket coffee filter coffee filter lid carafe carafe lid all are necessary if you combined a regular drip coffee maker and a regular grinder you d get roughly the same thing still one time i brewed coffee while forgetting to put the gold basket in the machine result coffee spewing out the basket and a wild mess i do not mind the number of parts for the most part because this allows for the dishwashable nature of the design however it could be a problem for those who do n t want to fiddle a lot to produce their cup n n the water tank is a bit hard to read as far as the numbers go n n steam is allowed to come up and interact with the grinding chamber this is more of a mess issue than anything else the grinding chamber can become pretty sticky if you brew more than one batch without cleaning it up first i do n t do that since due to the thermal carafe i can brew one large batch for the day and be done in most cases n nconclusion i tend to like this coffee maker on the grounds that it brews a very nice cup of coffee nicer in terms of clean taste and allowing the subtleties of the lighter city style roasts coming through than many of my older machines and it is a lot less messy than my old system i m certain that there is a lot of room for improvement as far as grind and brew designs go on this machine the water tank and grinder location design could be improved plus a bigger grinding chamber would satisfy the strong coffee folks more n nthis is definitely not a 1 star machine it s very good for what it s claim to fame is maintenance wise i ve had no problems with this machine at all since i got it last year it just takes a lot more to brew coffee than other machines but to me the coffee is much better than standard drip n nmy only other thoughts are wondering how other grind and brews fare the grind and brew from capresso for instance seems to address a lot of the cuisinart model s faults and although it costs more i would say it is definitely worth considering over the cuisinart considering the reviews the melitta mill and brew might be an option since it s a lot cheaper and supposedly easier to clean however the reviews seem to indicate much more mechanical issues so it seems you get what you pay for in construction quality i m not aware of others
1;14;34;0.9184794240936297;after my beloved thermal barrista from starbucks died i immediately went on a hunt for a new machine i did n t have any particular brand in mind although i knew i did n t want a mr coffee but i did have few major criteria my new coffee maker absolutely had to n n have a thermal carafe n n be constructed durably enough to withstand near constant use abuse n n not have a hotplate n n have a pause and serve feature the easiest criterion of the bunch as it seems to be standard nowadays n nwhen i started shopping i assumed it was my lucky day immediately upon entering the store i spotted a coffee maker display standing proudly like an oasis and immediately the cuisinart grind brew caught my eye i m embarrassed to admit that i did absolutely no research on the machine before laying down 149 00 plus tax for this sleek and gorgeous sludge making machine n nyou see this one stood proudly on a display next to other cuisinart machines in a section devoid of any other coffee makers in retrospect i feel cheap and manipulated marketing geniuses successfully steered my purchase with product placement at the time i was giddy with the thrill of finding a coffee maker that not only seemed to meet my standards but was also beautiful and caressed my fantasies of never having to clean grinder dust from my counters again n ni only briefly considered my previous self declared all in one ban i also remembered that i already own a perfectly good grinder or two and do n t actually need another one still i dismissed my objections signed the credit card slip tucked the box under my arm and away i went n nthat was two days ago n nlet the buyer s remorse begin n nwith hands trembling in excitement or coffee withdrawals i m not sure which i unpacked the machine a positive point set up was user friendly and intuitive basically although i never thought i d say that about a coffee machine given that mr coffee is truly plug and play excuse the out of context references i m a computer geek by nature i plugged it in inserted the charcoal filter in its in tank holder discovered instantly where where the coffee beans go not earth shattering in the grinder perhaps poured the water in the tank and hit start n nthe machine responded n n beep beep beep beep n ni opened it up peeked in at my beans and water and hit start again again the machine beeped a response i stood patiently waiting for the grinding to begin trying to convince myself that the beep was just to warn me it was about to start grinding i was wrong n nto be fair to cuisinart this was a simple case of user error and i remembered the advice i gave my parents when they were pulling their hair out over some piece of new fangled electronics when all else fails rtfm read the friggen manual i grabbed it and went to set it on the counter to read it the manual helped although not as expected as i moved the grinder lid aside to clear counter space for the manual i realized that the cap probably belonged on the grinder and not on the counter sure enough lid in place the machine stopped beeping n nin place of the beeps the sound of a ice cube filled blender and one with dull blades and an overworked motor at that invaded my kitchen i ripped the plug out of the wall i had to have done something wrong i ve been grinding my own beans for 15 years and i ve never heard a grinder that loud i picked up the manual again and flipped through it after being unable to find any troubleshooting advice to fix an insanely loud grinder i plugged the machine in again and let it rip n nnot only was the grinder loud it went on grinding for an extraordinarily long time holy cow i was sure this thing had ground my beans much too fine for a drip machine but again i was wrong the grind was fine although not at all adjustable and the coffee began to brew n nwhat s right about this machine n nin an effort to highlight the good too let me tell you that the coffee was n t horrible it was n t the best coffee i ve ever had but it did n t make me gag either it was a little weak even using the maximum amount of beans the machine could hold but that s probably because it took longer than optimal to brew and the coffee maker suffers from the same problem most drip machines suffer the water was n t hot enough when it began pouring over the grounds no i did n t actually stick a thermometer in it that was just a guess to be honest the coffee is n t any better than a 14 99 mr coffee could brew oh darn i was supposed to be highlighting the positive n nlet me try again n nokay the thermal carafe it was the only reason i chose this machine over the one right next to it the cuisinart grind and brew without the thermal carafe n nso was it worth the extra forty nine bucks yeah to be honest probably no hot plate no burnt coffee sadly though i have a few complaints about the carafe as well it keeps the coffee warm enough for a four hours or so and if it was the first of its type i d tried i d be satisfied but my only point of comparison is the aforementioned barrista and they do n t compare the cuisinart thermal carafe is double insulated and probably kept the coffee warm for nearly as long as the barrista keeps the coffee hot but the lid construction stinks the barrista lid is thick thermos like and actually seals when not in use the cuisinart s carafe lid is flimsy plastic and i imagine the difference between hot and warm could come from heat escaping through the thin plastic and from the unsealed hole the brewing coffee is meant to enter into and pouring coffee from this thing takes more effort than should be necessary the pot has to be tipped almost 180 degrees and the coffee still does n t actually pour it tinkles out i actually thought i was doing something wrong and that maybe the lid needed to be turned to the unlocked position to pour n nvery important it does n t pay attention failure to heed this warning will result in coffee dumping in your cup on the counter down your pant leg and all over your floor thankfully unless freshly brewed it wo n t be hot enough to burn you but it still makes a mess turning the lid to the unlock position while pouring will ummm unlock the lid that is the lid will fall off now i know this seems like common sense especially since that s how you turn the lid to take it off and fill it with coffee but when you ve been waiting not so patiently as you watch the coffee dribble out of the pot and into your cup common sense sometimes escapes you and you look for troubleshooting options just learn from my mistake here n nand finally n nabandoning all pretense of telling you what i like about this machine i ll move onto my number one complaint after the coffee is brewed your grinder will be wet not just condensations but dripping wet the first time i saw it i thought someone had poured the water over the beans instead of into the tank and i was looking suspiciously at my children who are much to young to drink coffee or even try to make a pot alas they were innocent and the folks at cuisinart were guilty although instructions directing you to wash the grinder thoroughly after after use are clearly printed on the lid of the grinder i would have thought had i thought much about it when i bought it that after every other use would suffice maybe one day i could forget and it d still be usable but nooooooo every use means every use i m just too lazy for this machine n nas a result it s going back and i ll actually shop around before replacing it
2;27;103;0.9050875000810276;i ve had my dgb 600bc for over a year and use it almost every morning i find that it makes excellent coffee using a blend of 50 french roast and 50 medium roast beans that stays hot for several hours there are a few points i d like to dispute from some of the negative reviews n n1 the coffee is n t strong enough it must be something about the beans used the quantity of coffee brewed or the palette of the drinker i ve never found a drip coffee maker that will make super strong coffee when making fewer than 5 cups use the cycle extender which will hold the water in the grounds for a longer period of time and strengthen the brew we were out of our medium beans yesterday so we made a full pot of french roast it was too strong to drink n n2 the coffee is n t hot enough user error should be considered although it is possible to have a bad heating element remember this is a thermal carafe if the last thing in the carafe was cold water the inside will be cold and you ll lower the temperature of the brewed coffee warm the carafe with hot water before starting the brew cycle or setting the pot up to turn on automatically we make coffee at 8 am or so on weekends and it s still steaming hot when we pour the last cup two hours later n n3 the grinder is too loud well i must say that the first and last morning i used the timer function the grinder woke me up it also scared the daylights out of my cat who was sleeping on the counter next to it it was a bonus that it broke the cat of his counter sitting habit in reality i do n t think it s louder than any other grinder it s just that it s a startling noise first thing in the morning we ve decided that we do n t really need the timer function but if you do and if your bedroom is near the kitchen you may want to close your bedroom door at night or set it up the night before and push the on button as soon as you get up n n4 it s too hard to clean there are 7 components of the pot to clean the two piece grinder the basket insert and lid and the pot and its lid that s three more parts than the standard coffee maker it s true that the grinder must be rinsed after each use as steam from the brewing coffee makes any bean residue in the basket clump and i tend to at least rinse all the pieces well after each pot if i do n t thoroughly wash them compared to grinding beans separetely where the grinder does n t have to be cleaned every time it s used you re probably looking at 1 minute of extra effort a day on the other hand you do n t have to wait while the coffee beans are ground then transfer them to the coffee maker so it probably does n t take any additional time at all to clean and dry the grinder and basket lid one lesson i ve learned is that it is crucial that 3 pieces the two pieces of the grinder and the lid of the basker be bone dry when the pot is reassembled for brewing if the beans get wet while being ground or sliding down the chute into the basket you will have a clumpy mess on your hands the other pieces do n t require the same rigorous drying i ve even left the basket unrinsed between pots n noverall if you are not looking to make stand your spoon up in it strength coffee do n t mind making sure the necessary pieces are dry can remember to rinse the pot with hot water before brewing and can tolerate the sound of an average bean grinder you ll find this cuisinart gem makes good flavored hot fresh coffee if any of these is something you do n t want to do you may want to look at other coffee makers or perhaps an espresso machine
3;1;74;0.8968107920569225;ye gads i forgot all about the fierce partisanship amongst purchasers that this wee little machine invokes last year i dutifully combed through all of the reviews and was almost pursuaded to look to another machine thank the stars i was not like many i was won over by the lure of 1 the thermal carafe 2 the auto grind brew feature and 3 the shininess i also trusted the cuisinart name and had been previously pleased with the brew central i noted however that many writers were highly displeased with 4 the noise and 5 the mess so after a year here are my experiences n n 1 the thermal carafe rocks out loud yes pre heating the carafe seems to keep the coffee hotter for longer but on the crazy work mornings that i use the auto grind brew function i do not pre heat and find no need to as i am out of the house at light speed note that the coffee is still scaldingly hot people seem irritated perplexed at the slowness with which coffee is dispensed from the carafe as well as the steep pouring angles necessitated by the carafe i am not at all disturbed by either however a relative in need of immediate coffee discovered that one can get faster pouring by just removing the lid which defeats the awesome vacuum packed thermal hotness but seems a likely remedy for those with a fundamental aversion to slow pours as far as weird geometry issues i have nothing to offer n n 2 the auto grind brew is very convenient it has always worked flawlessly for me and really amazes and pleases guests who may rise before residents n n 3 it is damn shiny n n nb i have a lot of stainless in the kitchen and through trial and error have found that the method stainless steel cleaner keeps it all damn shiny and keeps me from going stark raving from the constant buffing and rubbing n n 4 the noise really not that unusual for a coffee bean grinder i did not notice that it was any louder than other grinders if the grind portion of the auto grind brew is waking one too early i would imagine that one could either pregrind or use ground beans and just skip the grind function while it is intriguing to imaging a space age machine with stealth grind mode i would urge potential buyers to neither expect silence nor let lack of silence keep you from buying this machine n n 5 the ire over the mess was what nearly kept me from purchasing this maker and i completely forgot about the issue until just now when i re read some of the reviews i guess that i do n t understand what mess they mean there are seven parts to this thing that i clean carafe lid filter basket lid and grinder base lid i rinse the carafe and filter with hot water and clean the rest with hot soapy water it all takes approximately 2 5 minutes i never have to clean the rest of the machine i usually tilt the top loader lid open to let condensation out after brewing is done i occasionally wipe the inside of the machine down with a damp cloth i have replaced the water filter a couple of times but altogether clean up is not that big of a deal maybe others are not getting a tight enough seal on the the grinder parts n nsummary i have had this machine for over a year and have never had a single problem with it it makes delicious hot coffee i was almost deterred by the problems that others have had with it but am glad that i opted to take my chances i gave it four rather than five stars because so many people have had problems with it even though i have not experienced these problems the negative feedback must nonetheless be taken into consideration n ncheers n n currer bell
4;108;39;0.8812518850855994;delicious coffee restaurant taste stays hot beautiful too the only reason i did n t give this coffee maker 5 stars include two episodes of flooding the counter my fault both times 1st time forgot to put the paper filter in the basket and the 2nd time i overfilled it which is easy to do because there is no site glass and you ca n t see the numbers on the inside of the filling tank this should be improved by now i would imagine i am updating this on 6 6 09 and i originally wrote this review 1 16 2006 shortly after buying it the grinder is loud and has to be cleaned and dried between brews so i just do n t even use it anymore i buy ground coffee now and it s delicious stay true to the instructions i ve never had a coffee maker flood the counter before until now so be careful when filling the reservoir now i use a pitcher marked along the side to denote a perfect fill every time tips preheat the carafe while your filling adding coffee etc fill the pot with hot water and let it sit there for a minute or two and your coffee will be delicious for hours if you do n t think this could happen to you get it i did n t return it just became more disciplined with it i got it on sale so do n t have much money in it and it does make superb coffee im more careful now and the flooding has never happened again since using a premeasured pitcher to fill the reservoir a note on temperature hot nice and hot if you remember to preheat the carafe i get up at 4 45 make coffee and hubby gets up at 6 15 he still has hot great tasting coffee when preheating carafe if you use the program mode you obviously ca n t preheat the carafe and the coffee is n t hot enough for him so now i just make it when i get up and always preheat the carafe for about one minute while filling and adding coffee a great cup of coffee but cuisinart has some additional engineering to make this pot perfect i have owned this pot for 3 plus years and i m not sure if we ll buy another one the heater will no longer brew the whole pot so i have to push the 3 4 cup button to get it to brew all the water in the reservoir it takes too long to brew these learned experiences is why the pot does n t get 5 stars i am quality manager and will be sharing my 3 plus years experience with cuisinart quality professionals in hopes they will listen to me and fix these problems if you can get it on sale go for it but i would n t pay full price if you are easily frustrated do n t get it if you re easy going and want a great cup of coffee using these tips will help you enjoy this item if you choose to go ahead heh it can be like a test of your will determination and demeaner will it win out or will you enjoy
5;24;45;0.8557610122940441;have never written a review before but after reading all the reviews here had to add mine the first one i had the filter drawer popped open during grinding the first time it happened i pushed the button and went into the other room came back for my nice fresh cup of coffee and the ground beans were everywhere as well as the water boy that s not fun at 6am so after that i stayed there for the first few seconds of grinding and when it happened again for the third time in 3 weeks i brought it back and the second one has not done this to date i read one review that someone uses duct tape to hold the drawer in not sure why she does not return it and get another as that is not normal after reading all these reviews i found the solution to my second problem the gooey residue that gets under the grinder and gets in many places i have read the steam is causing this and to open top after grinding i think i will pull out the grinder as well as it is not needed after that point i thought there was a washer or something missing from the bottom part of the grinder i will give it a try tomorrow am i also get grinds in my coffe not allot but a few n nok now with those problems i still give it a 4 because the coffee is so damn good i have had grind and brews for 5 6 years so am used to washing all the parts no big deal it takes all of a minute i do it in the morning and leave all pieces upside down in the dish strainer the other issue i read is the temperature of the coffee i get up early and do n t have to work in the winter so i have 3 cups over 3 hours the first two cups are plenty hot enough but after 2 hours when i pour the third cup i have to zap it for 20 seconds to get it back to hot enough
6;52;7;0.8315271248891184;after reading some of the reviews on this coffee maker i was a bit nervous about purchasing it i went ahead and bought it anyway and i am so glad i did this is without a doubt the absolute best coffee maker i have ever owned if you are a true coffee lover and the taste of coffee really matters to you this is the coffee maker for you this coffee maker has every feature you could possibly want other reviewers have said there are a lot of parts that have to be cleaned this is true but that does n t matter to me as the taste of the coffee is absolutely superb other reviewers have complained about the noise of the coffee grinder c mon folks it s a coffee grinder it s not supposed to be quiet i ve never owned a quiet coffee grinder other reviewers have complained about the way the coffee maker beeps if you do n t assemble it correctly be glad that it does the coffee maker must be assembled correctly to work properly when it beeps just take a look at the way it s assembled it s not hard to see where you went wrong if the taste of your coffee matters to you this is the coffee maker for you if you could care less about the taste of your coffee then purchase a mr coffee all i know is that i do n t have to stop at starbuck s anymore as my coffee from home is now the best
7;78;32;0.8303412050007183;this coffee maker can be a little tricky to figure out loud and prone to finger prints however if you are willing put up with all that you will be rewarded with a very good cup of joe n ni almost returned this machine in the first week somehow i did not place the carafe under the spigot properly subsequently the coffee spilled all over the counter however that was the first and only time n nthere are extra parts that need cleaning i estimate it takes about three minutes total to clear everything and get ready for the next pot n nthe carafe will keep your coffee piping hot all day long however you will have to fill it with hot water first to get it hot before the coffee brews n npersonally i like getting large bags of whole beans at costco for about it s economical ends up tasting great and i do n t get grinds on the countertop anymore n ni use disposable coffee filters i find that it makes a smoother cup than the gold filter n nall in all this coffee maker is not for everyone it s for those who are willing to expend a little effort in the pursuit of the perfect cup of joe
8;56;48;0.7997730571441374;i bought my grind brew factory refurbished i have thoroughly enjoyed the coffeemaker it has leaked the secret is to assemble all the parts before setting the carafe in place no more leaks the lid leaks when you get to the bottom of the carafe i take off the lid at that point and continue pouring with no problem i do n t have a problem with cleaning i use a bottle brush to clean out the grinding spout i run a cloth over the inside after brewing i do n t find that troublesome the coffee tastes great i love the timer and never thought anything about any noise the grinder makes what s the big deal i never expected a silent grinder i had guests that were so impressed they are going to get one too to each his own
9;50;6;0.7751432759497783;the coffee grinder sounds like a siren going off if you use the grinder option which you wo n t as i ll explain in a minute n you ca n t fit enough beans in the grinder to make more than 6 cups of reasonably strong coffee which ends up only being 2 good sized mugs n when you grind the coffee gets thrown all over the inside of the grinder and the tube leading to the filter which then becomes saturated as the steam from the water condenses everywhere n as a result of the above you literally have to clean out the entire inside of the grinding tube n so if you grind you end up washing the grinder cover the tube to the filter the filter cover the filter itself if you use the gold filter the filter holder itself and of course the carafe itself you will get tired of this in a big big hurry hence you wo n t use the grinder n so you end up not grinding but you still have a pretty mediocre coffee maker you can put a bit more ground coffee into the filter my guess is you ll end up using paper filters but if you try to make a full pot of strong coffee it ll clog and run all over the counter and the inside where the carafe sits and it s a pain in the neck to try to clean inside there this coffee maker clogs and overflows more than any i ve ever used n ntruly this is just a disaster of a coffee maker many many other choices for less money that work far better
10;3;4;0.7633851297308856;i read a lot of negative reviews here but then i read a lot of positive as well what i can tell you is that i absolutely love this coffee maker and it has actually made a positive impact in my life you might think how can a coffee maker impact your life well keep reading n ni bought this coffee make 6 months ago i have had several other coffee makers but never one that actually grind the coffee for you i always bought preground coffee and put it in the machine and then added sweetener or creamer to make it taste good well i decided to make a change in my coffee drinking and try the fresh ground approach and this was the coffee maker i chose to use first i bought packaged coffee beans and this was a nice coffee but then i realized there were stores around me that allowed me to buy and blend and mix my own coffee beans i even found a place that will let me roast my own beans i have tried coffee s from around the world and learned to really appreciated the true flavors of fresh coffee i no longer use sweeteners or creamers i savor the flavor of good coffee there is something special really sitting down and just taking time out of the hectic day to just enjoy a good coffee even when i first wake up i sit back and relax and let the flavor and smell of the coffee get me going coffee has become something i enjoy rather than just a quick shot of caffeine to get me going i sat back the other day and watched the fall leaves come down in the yard while sipping on a mellow hawaiian blend i actually take my coffee with me to work in a thermos because it is so much better than work coffee and it helps actually to relax me so if you want to really appreciate coffee then this is a great coffee maker if you just are in it for the caffeine rush in the morning and trying to get by then maybe this is not the one for you n nthen a couple of the complaints here i will address as well first off it is noisy while grinding yes it is i wo n t tell you that it is n t it is grinding coffee beans for pete s sake what do you expect it is no louder than a hand held grinder or anything like that most people probably notice the noise because they set it to go off in the morning and everything is louder then i personally set it to start grinding about 1 minute after my alarm goes off i tend to hit snooze at least once so this way my alarm wakes me up not the grinding i do hear it in my bedroom but again it is grinding fresh coffee also this grinding phase is only for about 20 30 seconds after that you hear nothing n nsecond people complain about cleaning you do need to clean all the parts that come into contact with the coffee pretty much every pot this takes me all of about 5 minutes for each pot of coffee that s it just 5 minutes to make sure i have fresh brewed and wonderful tasting coffee you do not need to scrub everything between pots you can just rinse the carafe and rinse the filter area because it is just going to get wet again so they do not need a scrub and dry then rinse the grinding container and then wipe dry with a paper towel and you are good to brew another pot i do give it an actual scrubbing on the weekends to remove the oils from the coffee and any powder left up in the grinding area under the lid as there is some fine coffee dust up there and easier to clean out regularly than let it build up n nthen people complain about it pouring slow well this is a carafe after all which is personally a very nice design i do not ever have to worry about burning or scalding the pot by putting an empty coffee pot back on a hot machine this carafe will keep the coffee hot for hours and warm way into the evening if you need it to pour fast like when i am getting ready to go to work and fill my thermos i just remove the lid and it pours as fast as you can tip it
11;37;17;0.7110997859456257;the grinding mechanism is very loud and it will serve as an alarm clock as well as everyone else has mentioned it s very time consuming to take apart and clean each time this maker which was replaced by cuisinart in march has started cutting off just like the other two the unit will beep after 2 3 minutes as if it is finished it will eventually brew a pot of coffee if you start it at least 45 minutes prior to when you want it we ve contacted cuisinart about this paid the 10 00 shipping fee each time and have received 2 replacement coffee makers over the past 3 years changing the charcoal filter and decalcifying with vinegar has no bearing on the problem i suspect that cuisinart is shipping out reconditioned units each time it s getting rather annoying and i definitely would not recommend this machine however it does brew great coffee if you can wait long enough and put up with the aggravation this was a gift and my sister who has the same has been using hers for years without any difficulty at all however we re considering other brew and grind options

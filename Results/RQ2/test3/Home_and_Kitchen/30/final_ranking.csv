0;24;25;0.6430544974394894;i love this baking stone it bakes wonderfully and i love that it is non toxic however the first one i got was broken it was easily replaced the second one i received broke within 2 weeks it got a hairline crack in the middle of the handle and when i picked it up it literally just tore in 2 pieces as easily as a piece of paper i do n t know what happened i really want to love this and i really want to replace it with another but i am leery of this happening again i do n t know if i just got a lemon or if this is normal with stone baking ware this is my first piece of stone baking ware so maybe i did something wrong i love this stone so much that i ll probably order another and try again third time s a charm right

2;13;11;0.6152660063470019;it grinds beans quickly and efficiently it is very hard to use it will not start until you twist the top to the start marker nit is very hard to turn my wife does n t have the strength to operate it it is very messy when you open the top so you have to open it nover the canister or you will have coffee grinds all over the place this makes it even tougher because it is so hard to twist open or close

4;27;13;0.5506381553741934;whether you need extra dinner forks for your restaurant catering business or just to have on hand for those special occasions these are excellent quality each four tined fork sharp is 7 2 8 long with a simple clean design to suit any venue from simple to formal although not stated they appear to be a standard 18 8 stainless which should provide corrosion resistance n nthey are not the type that easily bends washes up quite nicely the best way to take care of flatware is to warm by hand and immediately buff and dry when done this keeps water spots from forming and will keep these dinner forks looking nice in between use they come in individual sleeves and can be tucked back in them for storage n nthese forks are quite a good value for what you are getting perhaps you could be nine dozen plastic ones for the same price but why buy disposable when you can get the real thing for a reasonable price i love the simple pattern the heft of the stainless and tines that do n t bend when they are used very nice set of forks for anyone to have on hand n nsample provided for review
5;10;10;0.4984932802639444;the company is called coffee art and it s true that if you want a coffee grinder that looks like a space ship this one is pretty arty n nhowever if you want a cup of coffee i d suggest trying something else n nthis grinder follows in the extremely popular form over function philosophy that has made apple a gazillion dollar success unlike apple however the manufacturer clearly did n t do any user testing on their design before they went into production let me explain n nthe lid is the stainless steel dome above the black band in the picture the lid is twisted to remove or replace it has a bayonet style lock unlock mechanism after putting in your coffee beans you replace the lid and twist it clockwise until the indicator points at the lock icon you do n t have to twist it very far maybe 20 degrees of rotation n nthe only catch is that the part you twist is basically the top of a stainless steel ball there s literally nothing to grab except round smooth steel you thought opening that jar of mustard was hard hah this lid will see your mustard jar and raise it 6 old jars of aunt betty s marmalade n nfortunately it s not like people grind coffee beans in the morning when they need a cup of coffee and there s no grounds and i ca n t get the lid to line up with the ing thing with the other ing thing why is it doing this to me n ntl dr if you want a manual dexterity small motor skill challenge first thing the morning by all means get the coffee art coffee mill n nif you actually want a cup of coffee go buy grounds from buckies or else some other grinder oh and by the way if you really like coffee do n t get a blade grinder they all do a crap job of grinding coffee get a proper burr grinder they cost more but they re worth it

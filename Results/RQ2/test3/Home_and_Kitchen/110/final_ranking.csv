0;29;58;0.8502703435802828;i have been researching and looking for a memory foam mattress for many years however i tend to be somewhat of a label junkie so i thought a temperpedic was the only way to go unfortunately i just could n t justify paying over 3000 00 for one so i have stalled and stalled and finally i saw these mattresses on amazon i love the savings that amazon will offer and after reading every review about this mattress i decided i would give it a try for the price i decided that really i could n t lose if it did n t work for me i would not be out an extreme amount of money and could possibly resell for almost or equal to what i paid for it nfirst of all to all of you reviewers my deepest thanks you all were pretty much right on in your evaluation of this mattress secondly i do n t think i have been this happy with a purchase in a long time when i wake up in the morning my back is really stiff and many days when i roll out of bed i feel like i have been hit by a mac truck i have to be careful how i walk until i limber up and then i can resume my normal range of motion now i can get out of bed and walk normally and feel like i have already gone through the warm up process of my morning i have no pressure points at night i am not lifted off the bed when my husband rolls over and when my 75 lb dog jumps on the bed i do n t even feel it ni love this mattress i could n t be happier with it and i could n t be happier with the price i do have the same issues with the oder of the mattress but as time goes on that has lessened and i have put dryer sheets between the bed pad and sheets to freshen the smell of the mattress and that has helped tremendously ni do n t find the mattress to be to warm that could be because i prefer to sleep in a cool bedroom and sleep with the windows open but i still feel the mattress breathes when the mattress arrived the trucking person helped me bring it into the house but i unpacked it by myself and let it de compress for the amount of time recommended and it expanded to the full 14 inches nfor once with the help of other reviews not being a label junkie has paid off
1;37;73;0.8331751315997353;for many years i have had different mattresses i am a side sleeper which sucks because i wake up in the morning and i have no feeling in my arms i have also had consistent back problems through the years no matter how much i spent on a mattress the back pains would never really go away for long i purchased this mattress because i had always wanted to try memory foam and the price was great i sleep wonderfully well on this mattress and wake up without the loss of feeling in my arms so worth it the mattress had a weird shape for a couple days maybe even a week or so and it also smelled like chemicals but it eventually smoothed itself out and the smell went away i weigh 200 lbs some of the people who complain about this mattress weigh 350 pounds i ca n t advise you if that is the case maybe stop eating potato chips and go for a walk from time to time this being said the mattess absorbs it does n t bounce around so if you are looking for a great mattress to bounce about like a pogo stick while havin sex perhaps you should invest in a trampoline
2;106;75;0.7914186235909887;i needed a new mattress i had a traditional coil spring and it had developed the compression body curve and i had very bad back pain it was less than 6 years old and lasted well i have health problems and spend a large amount of time in bed i am a big guy so i was concerned that a memory foam mattress might not be the best idea n nfirst lets talk about the negatives which are minor 1 you will sink in and it is difficult to turn i am a big guy but this would be less of a problem for a lighter person but it will still happen now from my research this is true for the vast majority of memory foam mattress so be prepared for this unless you have serious physical limitations you can and will adjust the nice thing is that you find that you do not toss and turn as much 2 when you get out of bed you sink a little again this is a characteristic of memory foam mattress but not a real problem 3 this mattress is so comfortable that you can actually end up sleeping in a position that will cause you to be sore or stiff in the morning again you will eventually adjust these are all minor and while they say you need to give these mattress 30 days so you adjust to them i think it depends on the individual n nnow for the positives which out weigh the negatives 1 comfort if you are coming from an innerspring mattress you will notice that these mattresses support you all around and yes you are literally cradled in comfort 2 as i mentioned above tossing and turning are greatly reduced it was not uncommon for me to wake up 6 7 times a night to turn or adjust on my old mattress even when it was new i have broad shoulders and i use a cpap so i wake up to turn now it is maybe 3 4 times a night on a bad night usually just 1 2 times and sometimes none 3 i sleep deeper and wake more rested with significantly less pain and stiffness n nin closing i would highly recommend this mattress especially if you are a larger person or couple
3;35;22;0.7897659802153445;so i got this mattress back on march 2013 it was a great alternative to the much more expensive sleep number bed i used to have i have fibromyalgia and sleeping on a regular mattress was so painful no matter how nice it was in the beginning it was great firm but forgiving and plush after about a year my now ex husband s spot was starting to sag i guess you could say we would turn it to get on different parts of the mattress the cashmere cover washed awesome stayed soft but i noticed by about two years my sides were also sagging in that butt hip area of your body i also started getting really bad night sweats and the bed under me would heat up so hot you could feel it with your hand never had a mattress do that before i tried different cooling mattress covers toppers and egg crates and nothing helped i changed to wicking sheets and pillowcases and even the bottom of my pillow would be super hot i know memory foam can get warm but this was way beyond that now i ve owned it 3 years and every position it sags so bad i would even turn it sideways instead of flipping it all the way around to wear different spots but even my 6 year old felt it i mean you ca n t flip it upside down like a regular mattress but you turn the head to the feet etc i ve gotten over my night sweats but it is still incredibly hot under me especially if i have been sleeping hard it causes me pain to lay on it now because of the sags i got firm neckar i knew it would soften up some but this was way more than that i do n t think i would purchase this again because a it gets so hot and b the sagging issues starting at only a year c i have attached a picture of what the bottom of the mattress where i slept i guess when i was having night sweats looks like it never got wet from anything else
4;39;97;0.7887368243579053;i waited over a month to write this review i was confident buying this mattress because it had great reviews it was shipped quickly and came right to my door i actually was able to use the box as added protection between the frame slats and the mattress it was a perfect fit i have to say since the first night i have had no back pain it s a miracle it is a firm bed but very comfy i do n t find it any warmer than the previous mattress there was a slight odor when i first opened it but it was not overwhelming and was gone in a couple days love love live this
5;47;33;0.7864704939648723;wow the best mattress ever it was delivered right on time during christmas break i helped the ups lady take it off the truck and get it in my house i could n t wait to get it in our bedroom it is very heavy but we were able to get this king sized mattress upstairs my husband and i opened the box and placed the mattress on our existing box spring we used our hands to tear the plastic off because we did not want to cut the foam as soon as the plastic comes off the mattress will begin to expand we let it gas off for the 48 hour period we slept on the old mattress for two nights ugg double h but honey when we went to bed sunday night it was an awakening my husband and i never slept so good prior to getting our new memory foam mattress we tried several mattresses in a store the only thing that i got was a neck cramp and an ab workout as i tried to hold my head up from the pillows this mattress was well worth it this mattress just meets you as you lie down it contours to your body and you feel yourself sinking slightly because of the price we were able to order memory foam pillows and 1500 thread count sheets we use to have to get out bed on saturday morning because it was painful to sleep in now neither of us wants to get up
6;25;24;0.7592635717585683;i could n t write a review that would express how much i love this mattress it is the best matress ever i was super nervous to buy a mattress over the internet but i am glad every single night that i did it has far exceeded my expectations it was delivered fast did n t have any memory foam odor expanded to full size within a couple hours and has been one of the best things i have ever bought we have been sleeping on it for about a month and i could n t be happier neither my spouse or myself suffer from back pain in the mornings anymore i have plans to buy ones for each of our kids i would definitely buy it again it s awesome
7;38;11;0.7568522964663063;a bit firmer than i expected but it is hard to tell if the mattress will get softer over time which would be a good thing when i ordered the mattress i was torn between medium firm this mattress and plush n nwhen it is time to change out other mattress in the house i will get the plush version to see if we would like it better n nsome of the reviews indicated the mattress was much thinner than 14 inches but that was not the case for mine i got two of them and they both expanded to some where between 13 13 5 depending on where the measurement was taken i can see the manufacturer claim 14 since there could be spot where the thickness is 14 n nwe did let the mattress lay in a well ventilated room for almost a week before we lay on it n nexcellent value for what i paid the price was is fluctuate quite a bit depending on when you purchase
8;48;21;0.7133245927004827;does lucid want to challenge me on this i do n t understand it says 14 but i have 12 1 2 with proof of picture 5 days after unwrapping i did not see where i could contact the seller directly using amazon so i will be forced to contact amazon directly and dispute this box that came to my door look like it had been rolled down a full flight of stairs in the empire state building it was bad i could look completely in the box by just lifting the left side n notherwise i would have given this product a much better review if i got what i paid for i did not spend over 850 on a mattress only to get 12 1 2 inches however the bed is comfortable as advertised and i believe meets exactly what it is explained in the product page other than the thickness amazon or lucid feel free to contact me and make things right and i will go a head and change my product review thank you
9;27;20;0.6765979052996314;what a buy have been sleeping on it for two weeks best sleep in years the mattress keeps you firmly in same position it is not too soft and not too hard comes in a box shrink wrapped cut the bag and away it goes takes about 24 hours for it to be large enough to sleep on the fumes were strong we had to leave windows open in room then the fumes linger under the covers for a few more nights ncompared this to the sealy ten inch we bought for a grand this is equal in every way
10;59;15;0.6420929190656404;finally and real memory foam mattress we bought a coil and foam mattress at costco with great reviews in the industry after 2 months the mattress lost its memory yesterday we received our lucid it was the only one we found with a warranty and now we know why it is great we did not wait the 48 hours to use and within 6 hours we were in dream land with a firm mattress yes thre was a smell when we opened the package but after 4 hours wer did not notice it anymore but even if there was we would accept it as the quality was exactly what we where looking for nif you want a mushy soft marshmallow mattress dont buy this but if you want a firm mattress that will give you a good night sleep aside from other activities i strongly recommend this one
11;84;41;0.6398129708986214;i bought this after recommendation by my friend who said its a good quality product for the price it did n t take much long after unwrapping the delivery package to regain its original size also compared to other reviews i did n t find any odor from day 1 i ordered for a firm mattress and this initially felt like medium firm or medium but after allowing it to settle for 2 days it was the firmness that i needed i would recommend this product
12;72;28;0.40210657436473385;bought from amazon in 11 2012 was ok for a year and then just got worse and worse where you actually sleep will be very soft and gummy and any area you do not sleep on remains rock hard no way in heck woulf this mattress last 25 years feels like fraud to me its not like it gets abused either very disapointed contacting lucid for refund
13;5;9;0.38099482165247106;this mattress is amazing i have no hip or back pain anymore i will be replacing all mattresses in my house with these

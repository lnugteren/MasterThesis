4;1.0;5.0;10.0;"Dear Amazon,\nMy wife and I looked long and hard before we finally located a countertop oven that appeared to be exactly what we wanted - the right features; sound recommendations, etc.  After we purchased the item, we were not disappointed  -  ease of operation, quality of performance; and, it looks great, matching our other appliances in the kitchen  In addition, it has knobs, rather than buttons to push. Like many  other seniors, we are somehow more comfortable operating  things by turning knobs,  rather than pushing a button - seems to allow a bit more control.  So we would wholeheartedly recommend this product - especially for senior citizens.\n\nFinally, when you check in your records, you will notice that a couple of months after we purchased this appliance,  we actually ordered 2 more.  Living in an adult community of all senior citizens, we're giving this item as holiday gifts  to  2 of our closest friends in the community.  Can one give a more solid endorsement than that?  .\nDavid";Highly recommend
3;2.0;5.0;365.0;"I bought this product at Sam's Club the other day. The product is great and I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a rotisserie. Having a regular toaster oven and a convection oven in the same unit is a great bonus! The unit comes with two wire shelves, two pizza racks (like cookie sheets but with holes in the bottom; great for Hot Pockets) that fit on top of the wire shelves, a 1"" deep backing pan, a wire rack that fits inside the backing pan, two rotisserie forks (for holding the meat on the spic), a rotisserie spic, and a rotisserie handle (for lifting it out of a hot oven).\n\nInstallation: A piece of cake. The unit comes packed in Styrofoam with the shelves and pans inside the unit; the rotisserie accessories came loose in the box but bagged in plastic. All I had to do was to wipe it down, wash the racks, and plug the box in.\n\nPerformance of the toaster oven: It toasts but boy is there a lot of room in here.\n\nPerformance of the convection oven: Never having used one before, I was surprised by the fans going off in the oven. But it did its job well cooking a pair of Hot Pockets to crispy perfection in just a little more time than the microwave. Homemade pot pies also cook very well.\n\nPerformance of the rotisserie: Great! I've cooked a beef roast and a Rock Cornish Hen and they came out so flavorful, tender, and juicy. The fat melts off this way and the drippings end up at the bottom. Make sure to cover it with a piece of foil. The unit says it can do up to a 7  lb. bird, but I've only tried up to 4 lbs.\n\nCleanup: The bottom pan slides out for easy cleanup.\n\nOverall I recommend this unit. Although I've never had a rotisserie or a convection oven to compare it to, it is world's better than my toaster oven. It is also  the price of the George Forman unit plus adds more. How can one go wrong?";Top-notch
68;3.0;5.0;327.0;"Actual rating 4 1/2 stars.  A half point deduction for door misalignment.  The door doesn't seal like it's suppose to.  It's not really a seal but a much larger gap than allowed.  Either the the frame or the door is slightly warped.  A minor error, however, as it still bakes near perfectly and I didn't detected any real heat escaping.  I still consider the build of the oven very good.\n\nI tested all features and they work excellent.  Convection is very good and cooks much faster and is quiet.  Much more quiet than the Toastmaster convection which was extremely noisy!  This feature is also handy for quick warm-ups or making bread rise.  The rotisserie also works very good.  You must tie the the chicken up well, however.\n\nThe timer does not exactly stop on zero.  It seems to go on 2 minutes or more.  Again, a minor thing.  Just compensate for this.  It could be because the timer is also the on\off switch.\n\nUsing a drugstore temperature gauge I found the reading between the gauge and the oven off by about 25-50 degrees.  However, everything cooks excellent using the oven degree markings.  No undercooked items.  In fact, this thing cooks much faster than recommended time in most recipes, sometimes much faster!  For instance, on its rotisserie feature I found a 3 1/2 pound chicken could of been done about 15 minutes (or more) earlier than the recommended 2 hours!  A roll recipe I found bakes about 25% faster than the recipe called for and I didn't even use the convection feature for either!  (Note: The oven degree reading and the drugstore temp gauge reading were the same when using the convection feature.)\n\nOne caveat: I did find the the broil feature slightly weak for red meats, (it more like bakes it) but it did cook the fish nicely (crisp skin) at near exact recommened times.\n\nWhen using this oven over 400 degrees the sides and top of the oven gets hot, including the controls!  I must note this oven has no insulation of any kind.  It also has no oven light, but one is not really needed, but it would be nice.\n\nIncludes a pamphlet type cookbook that is only a guide, but it does give sample recipes for every feature.  Enough to get you started on what it is capable of.  Includes two racks, a roast pan with separate grill rack, and a aluminium pizza pan with small holes througout.  For handy cleanups the bottom of the oven can be easily pulled out and washed.\n\nTo give you some idea of its size, it can handle a 12"" pizza, two if you have another of its pizza pan.  (Though I never tried it).  The rotisserie can handle up to a 5lb chicken.  The oven a 7lb roast chicken.  The oven interior is about 12"" front to back (not including curved glass door), about 13"" side to side, and about 10"" from top burner coil to bottom burner coil, with each coil about 1/4"" to 1"" away from the metal surface respectively.  The roast pan that comes with it has an inside dimension (excluding the lips) of about 11 1/2"" by 9 3/4"".\n\nOverall, a very good small oven for the price.";A Very Good Small Oven
2;4.0;4.0;242.0;This is not a $500 Cuisinart, but then it's not $500. I found mine at Macy's for about thirty percent less than most retailers, and at that price it was certainly worth trying. I bought mine to replace a fifteen year old toaster oven that I often found myself pushing beyond its limits. (It also caught fire while toasting frozen lumpia, but that's another story)\n\nPlusses? Inexpensive, large capacity, room to cook a small turkey or a couple loaves of bread without heating up the big stove. Minuses? It's kind of lightweight. The rotisserie won't handle much of a load. It's slow to heat up, especially compared to the typical toaster over. And it won't make toast.\n\nBut overall, it's not a bad deal, and if you entertain with a small kitchen- as I do- it's pretty useful.\n\n---\n\nFollowup: I've had this oven for two and a half years now, and it's still in almost daily use. You can't say that about too many inexpensive products these days.;Pretty good
1;5.0;5.0;138.0;"Pros: This oven serves me quite well for all of my baking and broiling needs.  I like that you can choose between bake and convection bake so that you don't have to use the convection feature if you don't want to.  When using convection the fan is nice and quiet.  I like having a timer so that I can leave the kitchen and not worry about burning something.  The timer bell is perfect - one solid ding that you can hear from another room.  Having two racks is great since you can have two things going at the same time.  My oven is on a cart at eye level and several people have commented on how good looking it is.  The way the crumb tray slides out easily without even opening the oven door is the most convenient I've ever seen.  I've had my oven for 2.5 months and so far I am as happy as can be with it.  I've made all kinds of things - homemade rolls, Christmas cookies, Mahi-Mahi fillets, pizza, roasted veggies, just to name a few, and everything turns out good.\n\nCons: The instruction booklet is laughable, it contains no useful information at all.  I want to buy a convection cooking cookbook, mostly to learn how to dehydrate stuff.  If you are a toast lover you will need a separate appliance for that because this oven is too tall to cook both sides of a slice of bread at once.\n\nMy oven came with one pizza pan, one baking/broiling pan with rack, two oven racks, and the rotisserie kit.  I have not used the rotisserie feature yet.\n\nUPDATE - May 19, 2007 - here it is well over two years later and the oven is still working perfectly.  So glad I picked this one.\n\nJuly 24, 2009 - Still going strong as my only oven!  Only one thing showing wear and that is the door handle.  It's loose but still attached.  I hope it holds on!!\n\nBy the way - I can make toast with this oven after all - I use the top rack in its highest slot, set the oven on ""broil"" and when the top of the bread is toasted I turn it over to do the other side.  It would be easier to have a toaster but my kitchen is so small I don't know where I'd put one.";I love it
62;6.0;3.0;107.0;Yes I loved my oven at first and bragged about it all the time.  It bakes bread, roasts chickens, cooks frozen fries nice and crisp, but the convection feature was what I loved... it gave the chicken a nice crisp skin, made the pizza taste like you'd get at a pizzaria... but it quit after 3 months or so.  So now it just bakes and broils.  It does that well, so it's still a nice oven, but disappointing to have a non-convection oven again.;loved it at first...
0;7.0;5.0;111.0;"I love this oven!  You can reheat fried foods with the convection oven to get things nice & crispy instead of soggy, like a microwave.  In fact, it is good enough to fry without oil, such as spraying sliced potatoes with Pam & then convectioning them until they are crisp outside & tender inside.\n\nThe Rotiserie is a little small (it only holds 4 pounds) and you need good cotten string to tie wings & anything else that may flop when turning.  But the food comes out a nice golden brown while being juicy inside.\n\nHowever, you can sit a 7 pound roast on top of the roasting rack and still have vegetables in the roasting tray.\n\nThe Pizza tray also works well with cookies, but make sure you flatten the pizza dough just before cooking if you plan to use the convection setting instead of the bake setting, since it makes breads rise higher as well as cook faster.\n\nMy only complaint was the instruction manual.  Having been advertised as having a ""Toaster"" feature at Sam's, it didn't have instructions for making toast.  I called the help number & learned that after preheating for 10 minutes, you can 'broil' bread on the top shelf for 2 minutes, turn over & cook another 2 minutes for toast.  You seem to need to preheat the oven for 10 minutes for most cooking tasks.  The Outside of the oven becomes hot enough to melt plastic left on it while cooking, so only set metal on top of it (like its accessories).";Better than the book!
64;8.0;1.0;61.0;"Thia little oven -- and I mean ""little"" -- takes up a lot of counter space, but provides very little usable interior space. I'm looking for a replacement for my ancient Farberware that would hold THREE 9 x 13 pans or a whole chicken. The inside of this oven is SMALL, SQUARE, and usable only with the included small square pan that is too small to hold the juices from a small roast chicken. If all you do is re-heat 12inch pizza, well, then, it's probably a good buy for the price. BY THE WAY, READ THE RETURNS POLICY CAREFULLY -- THERE'S A RE-STOCKING FEE even if the product description is misleading.";Not quite as described
42;9.0;1.0;48.0;Ordered one of these based on the reviews.  Talk about shoddy construction.  The outside walls are thin metal - pressing with a finger could dent.  Edges of the metal are not smooth and don't meet together well.\n\nWhat others said about Hot - it gets really hot.  Being that it is tall, can't have it under a upper cabinet - as the cabinet bottom gets blazing hot.\n\nReturned.;Hot & Shoddy
69;10.0;5.0;55.0;"This appliance is great for those that don't have a full-size oven or want the effeciency of a small convection oven.  It fit's a lot more than a toaster ""oven,"" so it can actually be treated like an oven.  It works great for beef, poultry, breads, cakes, pizzas, and just about anything you can cook in a large oven.  Having never used a convection oven, it does wonders for meats- but don't use it on breads (including pizzas) or cakes, though, because the outside will cook much faster than the inside.  My only complaint is that the pizza tray warps initially when it comes in contact with a frozen pizza every time it's used, but after the pizza heats up the tray flattens out again.\n\nThis appliance is really a lifesaver as a college student, since I can actually come close to re-creating ""home cooking"" (granted, it's not my mom cooking, but OK).  One more thing- this really is like an oven, so it really doesn't work for toast.  I recently purchased this from a local Target- which actually was only $70.  There really is no home appliance like this in the market- just large ""toaster ovens,"" and fortunately there doesn't need to be!";Truely a one-of-a-kind appliance!
65;11.0;4.0;48.0;With the approach of summer, the fact that the temperature reached over 90 degrees here, and I didn't want to cook with my regular oven, I bought my first convection oven, the Hamilton Beach Countertop convection oven.  The instructions state to warm the oven for 10 minutes before first use to get rid of any odor/smoke tendencies.  I didn't detect any odor or smoke. My first time cooking with the oven was a 2 lb. roast.  I used the timer and after one hour on convection, the roast was done.  The meat was juicy and tender.  I was amazed at the even cooking and the fast cool down of the oven --in just 10 minutes I was able to clean it.  The oven does emit warm air up to a foot away from the glass door, I didn't feel any heat coming from the sides or top, they are hot to the touch. Still this was way better than having my regular oven on when the outside temperature is over 90 degrees!  The inside of the oven is very large and comes with 2 racks which can be height adjusted, a rotisserie assembly, broiler pan with rack, and a pizza tray.  I would have given 5 stars if the oven had a continuous cleaning interior and the broiler tray were non-stick.;Cooks Great -- Better Than Expected
59;12.0;5.0;41.0;I normally don't write reviews-- infact, this is my first. I just HAD to give a review because this oven is FANTASTIC ! I feel like a child at Christmas OVERJOYED with a PRODUCT that EXCEEDS it's DESCRIPTION !I purchased it because I wanted an oversized one. Not having used a convection before, I had no idea what I was missing ! It arrived today and I just tried it with a frozen pizza. The convection REALLY DOES BAKE FASTER. Whereas it would have taken 12-15 minutes to bake in a regular oven ( 15 in my previous counter-top oven), the pizza was done a bit before 10 minutes with the convection. I realize that I'll have to watch the time on all convection baking not to overbake-- because it bakes so much faster. I was THRILLED to find that it has a 500 degree  temperature setting-which was NOT advertised-- because I like to bake my own fresh, vegetarian pizzas and you ideally need 500 degree Temp. I had researched all counter ovens previously to find one with a 500 degree setting and could not-- only the ovens well over $300 and even some of them don't. The oven in style is just GREAT, too-- it looks and handles like an expensive one. And, the door is GLASS so you can see inside. EVen if the oven was NOT a convection, the style and  OVERSIZE features permit you to use it in place of your regular  --which is what I wanted. 10 STARS and a, truly, DELIGHTED customer !;FANTASTIC OVEN!  IT's a JOY !
24;13.0;4.0;23.0;"Couldn't help but notice how the whole exterior quickly got too hot to touch. Little or no insulation inside meant it wasted a lot of heat; though if it's a cold day it's not really wasted, it's helping to heat your house.\n\nI read some reviews claiming this oven burst into flames; well just how does metal and glass burn? Probably some people should stay away from hot, as well as sharp, objects.\n\nAlso read about ""quartz"" heating elements; it has regular heating elements.

An interior light would be nice at times but a flashlight works.\n\nAll the functions work properly though the lower rear heating elements glows a little fainter on the right few inches.\n\nComes with two 12.5""x12.5"" pans and one grill that fits the pans, two slide-in grill racks, rotisserie forks/shaft and hot-chicken-removal thing that lifts each end of the shaft.\n\nI'm not much for cooking so I can only say that this oven really beats the old microwave for cooking frozen pizzas and hot pockets; not quite as fast but the crusts now get crisp and firm instead of soft and doughy and I can do 2 pizzas or 6 hot pockets at a time.\n\nOuch! Careful wiping the bottom under the crumb tray; sharp edge, nasty cut.\n\nAfter a year and a half the timer broke; I can wind it but it just unwinds right away so I'm using a battery powered digital timer with it.";great little oven
67;14.0;5.0;33.0;"MY REGULAR OVEN MALFUNCTIONED JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAY SEASON. I PURCHASED THIS HAMILTON BEACH COUNTERTOP CONVECTION OVEN OUT OF DESPERATION. I AM ADDING ANOTHER 5-STAR RATING FOR THIS SMALL APPLIANCE BECAUSE OF IT'S GENEROUSLY-SIZED OVEN CAPACITY, EASE OF USAGE, CONSISTENT HEAT DISTRIBUTION, AND EXCELLENT VALUE. I USED BOTH THE BAKE MODE AND THE CONVECTION MODE THUS FAR. THE BAKE MODE WAS USED FOR BAKING BROWNIES IN AN 8X8X2"" PAN. THE BROWNIES WERE EVENLY COOKED AND PERFECTLY CRUSTED WITH NO OVER-DRYNESS. THE CONVECTION MODE WAS USED FOR A ROAST TURKEY BREAST WHICH RESULTED IN AN IMPRESSIVE UNIFORM BROWNING TO THE SKIN WITH NO OVER-BROWNING OR DRYNESS TO THE MEAT.

37;15.0;1.0;21.0;"We knew the price was very, very reasonable, & were prepared to pay more, but expensive isn't always the same as good. We'd read the reviews & done the research. We were so excited to find a convection toaster oven which would accomodate not one, but two 12-inch pizza plates. Couldn't wait to get it out of the box. Our priorities were: making toast, warming and/or baking, augmenting our stove's single oven for entertaining. Well, it may have worked for the latter two - if it wasn't a fire hazard! The glass door handle was glued onto the frame & wobbly, not secured by screws nor clamps. On one side, there was a full 1/4"" gap between the door & metal housing & the door would not close flush. Of course, there is no gasket. Anything made of a flammable material sitting over the unit, such as a cabinet, could conceivably become overheated due to the heat escaping from the gap. As for the first job, well, just forget that. This item does NOT make toast, unless you preheat for several minutes, then turn the pieces over half way through - too much trouble! Finally, there is no way to know when the unit is preheated. So, you better invest in an oven thermometer or be a good guesser. It will be shipped back out of our home as soon as the Post Office opens.";Why Can't It Be Big AND Good?
61;16.0;4.0;26.0;I really like this little oven. The food I've made is good and tasty. The meat is very juicy when using the convection feature. I also use it to make yummy caramel rolls. They are high and fluffy. The convection feature is also quiet. I was a little surprised at that. The rotisserie works. I used it today to make a 4 lb. chicken. Tasty and juicy! What I don't like is the squareness of the inside. Only square or round pans go inside, no 9 X 13 cake pans. Also the instruction manual can be a little vague. More recipes would have been nice. Clean up is easy. All in all, I am satisfied.;I Like It!
50;17.0;4.0;20.0;"I moved into an efficiency apartment about 1.5 years ago.  A major down flaw of the place is the fact that it does not have a full kitchen!  WHAAAAAAAT?  A person that loves to cook without a way to cook?  All I had was a hot plate?\n\nBLASPHEMY!\n\nI needed a way to actually cook.  ""Is there a such thing as an oven that does not take up the room as a regular oven?""\n\nEnter this oven.\n\nThe little kitchenette is small on top of not having an oven or stove.  I looked at the Cuisinart version of the countertop oven but it was more expensive and it did not have the convection feature.  I rolled the dice and went with the lesser name.\n\nI usually wait a while before I make my opinion hence 1.5 years later.  This oven has saved me from going crazy and choking people because I could not cook.  The convection feature is great!  A few times the fan did get a little noisey but a simple cleaning fixed that right up.  I have used the rotisserie many times.  I will advise you that if you are making a full sized chicken you use some twine to tie up the legs and wings.  If you do not do this they will (and if the bird is large enough) drag the pan and sometimes stop the motor from turning the bird.  When making roasts be sure to try to get the ""spit"" as centered as possible.  Some of the best roasts I ever made were in this oven using the rotisserie feature.  I do wish it came with a way to make Kebabs or possibly a basket as the Ronco rotisserie oven.\n\nThe Drawbacks?:\nBaking:\nI like to bake as well as cook meals.  If you are baking anything of any importance be ready to loose a shelf!  I will tell you why.  Since this oven is basically a large toaster oven it has the same heating elements that a smaller toaster oven has and works the same way.  The door does not seal too well so a lot of the heat is lost.  This makes the elements  almost in constant ""ON"" mode when you are using the oven.  The elements are just to rods on the top and bottom of the oven.  If you try to make a cake, or pie, or an item that requires an indirect heat in order for it to turn out right.  I am not saying you can not bake in this oven!  My solution was to use the included baking pan or one of the pizza trays on the top shelf.  Yeah yeah this only gives you one shelf to cook and and it increases the cooking time if you have, let's say a two layer cake or two pies, but it is very worth it.  You can either have a cake that takes twice the amount of time but turns out perfectly or you can have a cake where one of the layers has racing stripes from the elements.\n\nToaster Oven:\nNo can do.  The oven has too much space to be a genuine toaster oven.  I have a true toaster oven when I want the speed and direct ""heat"" of a toaster oven.  It really does not make great toast because of this so I also have a true toaster, I mean come on now, toaster ovens do not make great toast either.\n\nAll in all I love this oven.  I use it every single day.  It has saved many a people from being choked out as well!  The few flaws the oven has does not compare to the benefits that this oven provides.  If you are thinking about buying this oven you need to stop thinking and purchase it... it is calling your name!!!";Life Saver... LITERALLY!!!

The oven  worked great at first, I loved the rotisserie, convection, etc.  Then the convection  fan stopped working, but the  other functions seemed ok, so we kept using it.  Apparently this oven is made very cheaply, with cheap materials and low quality standards.  The cord seemed ok,(  I always check before I plug anything in)  but it was not.  Suddenly  while I was cooking  dinner  there was a popping sound and flames shot out from the cord.

This is the fourth convection/toaster oven that I have tried since last November. Since its now March that's trying out a new one every month. I've gone through 2 Black & Decker ovens, a GE, and now a Hamilton Beach.\n  I started back in 1995 with a little Black & Decker toaster oven. It was a bit on the small side but I got to where I was using it more than I did my microwave - since I'm a bachelor that's saying a lot for a toaster oven - then the toasting function on it died putting me on this quest to find the perfect Convection Toaster Oven. I found right away that there ""ain't no such thing"" as a ""perfect toaster oven"", with Convection or not.\n  First of all for looks or style, this one is ok. Not great, but not too bad either, but it's a bit on the blocky side. Kinda like an oversized kids toy building block and it does take up more counter space than most of the other convection toaster ovens do. The oven door is made of glass and curved out just a little. This helps to break up that flat sided cube look. The top edges are rounded and the side panels have a slight bulge with vent slots that also help to remove that ""cube"" or plain box shape blah look.\n For its construction it is pretty well made. The sides and top are double walled and the back might be, its heavy enough material that it's hard to tell if the back is doubled or not. This helps it to contain its heat inside of it instead of heating your kitchen or whatever room you are using it in.\n  The crumb tray is easy to slide out and has raised sides to help from spilling it or dumping it where you don't want to and only where you do want too. It is also made of heavy material that will not be easy to bend or warp like some of the other brands do.\n  Inside the oven it has several slots to put the trays in giving you several height choices for what you are cooking. There are four levels for the racks, two above the rotisserie and two below it. The top two levels would be for toasting or broiling, all though; it doesn't have a setting for toasting like most ovens of this kind have. What I also like is that the groves are a tight enough fit that you can slide the wire oven rack out a good distance without it tipping down very much and allowing whatever is sitting on it to slide off. This makes it easy to check on whatever it is that you are cooking. A couple of the other toaster ovens I've tried if you slide the wire rack out with something on it you have to watch it or it will be all over you, the counter, and the floor. Along with anything and everything else that's close enough.\n  Now for its down side. The temperature control is way off! And I mean waaaay off! Like anywhere from 75 degrees over what you set it for to more than 150 degrees over!  It averages around 100 to 125 degrees over what its set for. So if you really want this oven for some reason or other, be sure to get a good oven thermometer and placed so that you can see it.\n  If it wasn't for it getting way hotter than what its set for I would like to keep this one. For one thing I'm getting tired of looking at these things trying to decide what one to try next, just to have to take the thing back and start all over again. Now it's got to the point that it's a personal challenge or ""My Personal Quest in Life"". I'm going to find a toaster convection oven, with or without a rotisserie or an inside light, and one that everything actually works like it's supposed to, if it's the last thing I do!\n  All I want is a toaster convection oven with a built in rotisserie, and a inside light. I would like one with a separate button for the convection fan so that I can choose when to use it, or not to. It needs to be big enough to hold a 12"" pizza &/or a 9""x12"" baking pan with handles. And most important of all, have an accurate temperature control that will get to and hold the temperature that I set it for with a timed auto shut off! Now is that asking too much? If anybody knows where I can get one like this please let me know!\n\nI forgot to add in my above review that no matter what setting I used the top heating elements are on all the time. So when baking a pan of something, like scalloped potatoes, I've had to cover it with foil to keep the top heating elements from broiling it or toasting it till its burnt. When selecting Broil or Rotisserie the bottom elements turn off, like they should. But when using the Bake setting the top ones should not be on but they are. Also the flip side of going way over the temp setting and getting way too hot I found that's only when it empty or cooking something small. With a pan of scalloped potatoes in it, it had a hard time getting hot enough to cook them. I set it on 400 and after half an hour it finally got up to 350. So its a big time spazz and going back, like the others.\nI'm going to try the Oster TSSTTVMNDG Digital Large Capacity Toaster Oven next. Maybe it will work better.";Another one that wasn't worth bringing home or taking out of its box
27;25.0;4.0;11.0;This is a great oven due to it's proportions that allow larger items than most of the tabletop convection ovens I've seen advertised because it's more square than rectangular.  It has baked enamel inside so no fumes from teflon-like coatings.  An aspect which I found hard to find in these types of ovens. This is more an oven than a toaster oven because the elements are too far apart for two sided toasting.  Putting it on broil at 375 degrees crisps bread on one side.\n\nMine is still running after 4 years.  The temperature could be more accurate but I bought a cheap oven thermometer that I can see through the glass front to make any adjustments.  The front door has warped some and doesn't hang completely straight anymore but it's negligible.  From the tiny purposeful door stop on the left, it looks to have been designed to not seal completely but I don't feel much heat escaping the front. You cannot put anything on the glass door when it's open.  My counter is too short to allow the door handle to support the door when the oven is open and this may have contributed to the door hanging crooked in the end by stressing the hinges. You aren't supposed to put anything on the door while it's open either but that turned out not to be an issue since I always put my items on the stove or hot pad.\n\nI have mine under a cabinet and the warmth from the top has not affected the cabinet at all.  The front gets warm but the sides do not.  The rotisserie would only be for small things.  I found that you had to be sure a small chicken was put on securely with nothing hanging or it would sag and drag on each revolution. A large roaster would be awkward.\n\nThe convection aspect works really well for baking. I hope to use it for dehydrating in the near future as well.  A good dehydrator with metal racks and metal box, to avoid plastic fumes, is really expensive and the merchants aren't eager to tell you a convection oven like this will do the job at a much lower price.\n\nOne of the grills conveniently insets into the baking pan. I used the grill with the pan so much it wore through to the copper underneath so I would use a special scrubbing sponge to prolong it losing it's coating. I still use the grill.\n\nIt has a wind down timer. Sometimes turning it to the end then to the time I want will help it ding at the end.\n\nIt's almost funny but despite it's minor foibles with the door, timer, and temperature, it's actually a straight forward useful oven at a great price.;A great convection oven for the price.
49;26.0;5.0;14.0;"I purchased mine from another source other then amazon and paid only $85.00 (including taxes). I love the fact that you can bake, broil, and do a rotisserie chicken. Some people from other reviews have had trouble with the heating elements, mine seems to work just fine, it actually cooks a little faster which I will need to adjust my recipes accordingly.  We are temporarily living in an RV while we are in the process of moving from NC to OH...and since I do NOT like to cook in our gas oven (cooks unevenly and hard to broil anything! so slow to cook!) , I needed an electric alternative to my oven.  I bought this one and so far, I'm pleased with it. It's BIG so be prepared to have an area to use it!! I use mine on top of my stove, it'll be more of problem when I need to use the burners on my stove and cook in this oven (!?!?!? what to do !@?!?!?) . Gas is so expensive, I'm glad I can use an electric oven in my RV, it saves money in our propane tanks! *lol* Also, be prepared that the sides of the oven will get very very hot, but once done cooking, the oven cools down very quick, good for those hot days and don't want to heat up your house.  Also, the electrical cord is rather short, it needs to be right near an outlet or you'll need to get an extension for it. Again, it's bigger then most convection ovens but you can cook two 12"" pizzas at the same time!!! I love mine and can't wait to cook more and more in it! I just baked my first chocolate pudding cake in it and it came out DELCIOUS! Yum!  P.s. it will NOT fit a 13""x9"" pan but will fit a brownie sized pan 11"" x 7"".";Awesome Product, love mine!
66;27.0;4.0;16.0;"I like the way this unit cooks.  It is even and crisp. However, the unit power light burned out after two uses.  The timer also doesn't work unless you choose ""stay on"", making the timer useless.\n\nI'd have to say for the $60.00 price tag it is still a good oven.\n\nYou get what you pay for.";great cooking, little attention to detail
53;28.0;5.0;13.0;I just love convection ovens having owned a Faberware for twenty years. When it was cashiered, I did research on Amazon.com for a replacement. The Hamilton Beach seemed the best and I have put it to the test for almost two years. It is slighly smaller than the Faberware(not made anymore) but does have a rotisserie which works wonderfully. I put whole chicken fryers, chicken breasts, and 3-5 lb pork loins on it. Mouth watering good!! It does cook much faster than an oven and because of this and it energy savings my oven is never used. Two minuses would be the door opens down from the top and not from the side so you run the risk of dropping something on it and breaking it and it also does not seal well but does not seem to affect cooking.  Controls are easy to use and read.  Comes with plenty of racks and trays. Works just great for baking also. Im very pleased with it.;big value for little bucks
16;29.0;5.0;9.0;We bought this oven about 18 months ago. It isn't pretty, it could use some insulation and a tighter door, the rotisserie is cheesy but we love it for baking. We are two old frugal people with a small high altitude kitchen. I bake our weekly bread, two loaves at a time, no problem. Cookies are quick on the convection setting and you can't bake more than you should eat in one sitting. Cake mixes take a little work to perfect but baked potatoes, beef jerky, quiches, pies, even drying fruit, it's all good.  We park the oven outside for summer baking and love the way it helps heat the kitchen in the winter. Not as noisy as our last fancy Bosch $1500 convection range and the automatic turn off is nice. We weren't sure we could live without a regular oven but with this and a couple counter top burners so far so good.;Great Little Oven
8;30.0;1.0;8.0;I purchased this oven just over a month ago in order to replace my excellent, but now worn out, 15yo+, Farberware Convection oven.\n\nThe Hamilton Beech Convection Countertop Oven is nice looking out of the box, but that was it.\n\n3 Attempts at using the Hamilton Beech Convection Countertop Oven demonstrated that I could cook food faster in my big electric oven than I could with this thing.\nLet alone experience the time savings I did with my previous countertop convection oven.\n\nAnd that turns out to be the least problem.\n\nI am surprised the Hamilton Beech Convection Countertop Oven is even allowed to remain on the market. It is a fire hazard!\n\nYou can not place the side walls of this oven near anything flammable or meltable. Nor on the top, or over it. So forget about placing it near a painted drywall, or under a cabinet.\n\nEven worse, just from touching a side of it, a curious child could receive a first degree burn in the blink of an eye!\n\nDO NOT BUY!;Terrible & Dangerous
18;31.0;2.0;9.0;This was our first convection oven.  We heard great things about them and decided to buy one.  I can say honestly with no hesitation that I preferred the regular, smaller counter-top oven that this replaced.\n\nIt is large and it's convenient to be able to put in a couple trays that can also fit in the dish washer.  That's about the only thing that's good about it.\n\nNow I list what I think are major design flaws:\n\n[*] The glass front is amazingly bad for letting out heat.  I can feel heat coming out of the thing several feet away.  They should have used some type of shielded front.  I don't even want to think about how much energy is wasted baking something for a couple hours in that thing!\n\n[*] There are dead spots in it where the air doesn't circulate with the convection.  I have put biscuits in there a few times.  With the convection on, the biscuits in two of the corners burned while the others remained raw.  Unacceptable.  I don't know if this is typical of convection ovens, but it wasn't good.  If I were designing this thing, I would've put some smoke in the thing and let it whisk around like they do in air tunnels.  It should always flow well.\n\n[*] There are no shields over the heating elements!  Just about every toaster oven in the world has a plate in front of the heating element so it won't blast food right in front of it.  No such luck with this thing!  If you put anything near the top, it burns in moments.  Plus since the glass front dumps all the heat out, the elements remain on for pretty much the entire time.;Terrible experience
36;32.0;3.0;10.0;I have owned this oven for many years. Purchased mine at Sams or [...]. It worked well for about two years. Food cooked in this oven came out tender and juicy. Unfortunately, the door on mine went from closing without really sealing, to usually not closing at all. I have been using tape to keep it closed for a couple of years now, but it still allows a lot of heat to escape. I have looked at several other brands, but their doors don't look much better. I am now looking for a new oven that is smaller as I don't want to leave it on my countertop, and this one is quite large and heavy for putting in a cabinet.\n\nPROS: If you are looking for a large convection oven that you can use as a rotisserie too, look no further.\nCONS: Cheap door construction lets a lot of heat escape. This also means that food tends to cook more towards the back than the front of the oven.;Nice oven, bad door design.....BIG
55;33.0;5.0;12.0;I've been having this oven for more than 4 & half years now. Absolutely love every feature of it. I don't quite understand bad reviews for this product. How could this be compared with $30 or $40 ovens. This is a keeper. It is so quiet, easy to clean. It heats up your food in minutes with nice convectional feature. Of course, every product has its good & bad sides. But  I haven't found one in the past 4 & half years. This product will meet your expectations & beyond.;ABSOLUTE A KEEPER
48;34.0;1.0;11.0;"this is without a doubt one of the worst purchaces i have ever made;i was replacing a Farberware convection over, saw this on sale, it looked good , so i bought it. One week to the day the fan sounds like someone sticking a screwdriver in it, what a racket, the temp is way off , almost 50 degrees, and the timer iff almost 10 min, when it works. Buying this oven would be throwing your money away in my opinion.";poor choise
6;35.0;1.0;7.0;"I did a lot of research, and read a ton of reviews, and felt confident that purchasing this countertop oven would be the best choice.  I was SO wrong.  When I unpacked the oven I noticed that it was a bit flimsy, but obviously things are not made today like they used to be.  It's a pretty oven, and looks great on the countertop.  But when I used it for the first time I noticed a LOT of heat coming from the door area.  Upon further inspection, I saw that there was a 1/4"" gap between the frame and the door that ran all along the top of the door, and on the right side of the door.  The door is pinned onto the frame, and cannot be adjusted.  Needless to say, I certainly don't want to be using the AC and heating the house (via a defective oven) at the same time.  This oven is obviously defective, and will be returned to Amazon.  I am very grateful that Amazon makes the return procedure so easy.\n\nUPDATE (August 1, 2011): A friend of mine told me that she recently bought this convection oven and was also very disappointed with it.  There were no 1/4"" gaps between the frame and door (like mine), but apparently it would burn the back section of the food, and the front portion would be almost cold.  We have come to the conclusion that based on the wonderful reviews from a few years ago, Hamilton Beach must have made a MUCH better convection oven at that time.  If you look at the more recent reviews, there are many people who are unhappy with their purchase.  My friend also commented how cheaply the oven is made, and compared it to an Easy Bake Oven.\n\nMy recommendation is...don't waste your money.";Very Disappointed
33;36.0;1.0;9.0;I bought this oven frm PC RICHARDS because they no longer carried The fabulous Farberware convection oven. Took it to a demo at a school and proceeded to make puff pastry sugar straws. Set the oven to stay on, convection, 450 degrees and inserted the 2 included trays with silpat liners and puff pastry straws. 10 minutes later, The top straws were burnt to a crisp and set off the fire alarm. The bottom tray barely cooked. (30 minutes later the fire department declared it was safe to return the building).\nI continued the demonstration, however, this time I assigned a person to watch the oven.....Again, same results...burned top tray, raw bottom tray. Repeated one more time, same reults. To call this a convection oven is ludicrous. This oven maybe large by toaster oven standards, but in reality one may only cook one tray at a time. Who needs such a big bulky product to cook 1 tray?\nThankfully, PC Richards accepted the return. Good riddance to old trash!;Set the school fire alarm on
5;37.0;1.0;6.0;The first thing I used this oven for was cooking 2 pizzas. Don't bother as they won't cook evenly unless you rotate them halfway through, or one will be cooked on top, but not on bottom, and the other is opposite. I didn't have problems with rotisserie, convection cooking, or broiling. The timer was loose though, and I couldn't tell how long it would run. Then, several months later, it just died. No power at all, no light, no heat, no fan, no rotation. I guess I won't be considering Hamilton Beach again in the future.;Works ok, for its short life...
46;38.0;5.0;10.0;This is an AWESOME oven!  We have the world's smallest kitchen -- boiling an egg is enough to give you heat stroke ... and our HOA Rules prohibit the installation of a vented fan above the stove.

14;40.0;3.0;7.0;"The oven itself is spacious, and big enough for a couple of 12"" pizza pans.  We use it outside on hot summer days in Dallas, when we don't want the heat in the house to make it harder (more expensive) on the air conditioning.  As far as the rotisserie, it broke after 2 uses.  Motor assembly for the R is very flimsy with very small plastic gears.  If the food on the rotisserie bar gets jammed for even a short time, this feature will probably break. Also, if the ""load"" is at all unbalanced, the rotating motion is not smooth at all.  I could not locate any replacement parts as the motor is made by some obscure company in China.  If you really want a good compact rotisserie oven I recommend that you look elsewhere, especially to the Rhonco products.";Wimpy rotisserie, don't count on it. Oven OK

With my regular full-size oven, convection cooking cuts your time by several minutes; but, with this oven, it takes several minutes longer. As several have mentioned, rotisserie works only with a VERY small chicken or hen. Satisfied with the oven (baking) part, gave up with the rotisserie and convection.

41;47.0;5.0;8.0;"I bought this oven a little over a month ago from walmart.com with site to store delivery. It's cheaper but takes 3 weeks to arrive at the store. It doesn't come with a pizza pan but two shallow baking pans. More like cookie sheets. They're aluminum so the heat makes them curl up when you use them. They work fine though. I cover them in foil to make cleanup easier. I baked a 5# chicken on the rotisserie. It came out nice and tender. It took 3 hours and I used a pop-up so I wouldn't overcook it. I didn't have the weight of the chicken centered, although I followed the instructions. Use kitchen string to tie the chicken real tight. I used dental floss (that was all I had)and couldn't get it tight enough. The chicken legs and breast kept hitting the pan underneath. I finally took the pan out and just let the crumb tray catch the drippings. It just barely contained the drippings. Everytime the breast was in the down position the rotisserie hesitated before continuing on it's rotation. When the breast was in the up position the rotisserie sped up a bit. It didn't affect the cooking at all but I imagine it could wear on the motor after awhile. I baked a ""Freshetta"" pizza and it turned out better than when I used a regular oven. More moist. I used the convection setting for that. I've also baked asparagus and that turned out real good. I baked a frozen enchilada on convection and didn't allow for the shortened cook time so I overcooked it. After using the oven and letting it cool it was easy to wipe down. I really like the oven.

12;49.0;3.0;6.0;"I bought this toaster oven from Amazon in October, 2009, for $78.26 and it has gotten a real workout - used at least 2 to 4 times per week since then.\n\nFirst, the specs. This is a big unit with a footprint 18""W x 13.5""D x 12.25""H but you will need plenty of space around and over it as it gets very hot on the outside. The interior is 12.25"" by 12.25"" with an interior height of 8.75"" from the bottom shelf up to and touching the top heating element. There are 4 shelf positions. The oven came with two shelves, two 12"" square pans with 1/2"" lips (which make good cookie sheets), one rack that fits inside the pans, plus a rotisserie and lifter. The oven will easily fit a 10"" pie pan or corning casserole dish but not an 11 3/4"" baking dish because of its end protrusions. If turned with the handle kitty-cornered, a 10"" cast iron skillet with a 5"" handle will fit. It's perfect for two loaves of bread and a cast iron dutch oven will fit with the shelf at the bottom position. According to customer support at HB, the oven has a non-stick coating that is not teflon. There is a crumb tray at the bottom that slides out for easy cleaning\n\nI compared the temperature settings with a thermometer from Walmart and the settings appear very accurate. As has been noted by others, there is a small gap at the top right corner of the door. Breads and cookies seem to brown a little more at the right back corner, but not so much as to be a problem or necessitate moving food around while baking. Although I have never used the rotisserie and only used the convection setting a few times, I have used the bake and broil settings for many, many items: yeast breads, quick breads, cookies, muffins, casseroles, barbecue ribs, barbecue chicken, roast chicken, cornbread, baked beans, pot roast, roasted veggies, broiled tomato cheese sandwiches, baked eggs and, of course, pizza and it handled them all equally well.\n\nI would have given the HB a rating higher than 3 stars except for two problems. As mentioned, the outside gets very hot and would have to be kept well away from any young children and might not be a good buy for the very elderly. And I know from experience that plastic bread wrappers should not touch the oven when it is in use. In addition to the exterior heat, there is no shelf stop for when the shelves are pulled out. Worse, when the shelf is out about 3 inches, it dips down in front about 1/5th inch. When handling a 10"" Corning dish filled with baked beans or casserole, it worries me that I might pull the shelf out a little too far or too fast and have the dish slide on out giving me a lap full of scalding food. I've never had a toaster oven before, and don't know if this dipping is a common problem.\n\nWould I recommend this oven? Yes, with the above cautions. And as I will never cook 2 pizzas at the same time, an oven of about the same square footage, 13"" x 11"" or 14"" x 10"", to fit baking dishes or small roasting pans would be more useful for me.

56;50.0;5.0;9.0;Owned this oven for over a year now. Holds it temp, and the timer is within a minute of being correct, which is about all you can expect from a dial type timer.  Easy to clean, and comes with plenty of attachments. My only problem, I got it just before a move and lost all books and info packs that came with it during the move.\nBefore it died, I had a very nice pizza oven, but is unit cooks pizza much better. Crusty, but chewy crust, and the pepperoni is just browned about the outside edge.;Excellent Unit
15;51.0;5.0;6.0;I bought this despite warnings in other reviews about generated heat, temperature, etc, and I'm delighted with it! I had feared the kind of uneven baking you get with even good toaster ovens, but that is not an issue with this oven at all.  It bakes perfectly, and the temperate is spot-on, or at least is completely in sync with the two different oven thermometers I put in there to check it out.  (I haven't tried the rotisserie function yet, but that wasn't a factor in buying it anyway)\nNow my regular oven can return to its regular function (since it sucks juice like crazy, and heats up the house, I rarely use it -- prefer to store my pots and pans in there).  So yes, I recommend this counter-top heartily and without reservation!;Exactly what I wanted
20;52.0;5.0;6.0;2018:I have now owned this oven for twelve years. I use it a lot. still works like new.\n\nI purchased this oven in December 2005 - it's now March 2018 and works like new: I use this item almost everyday. I bake, I roast, I cook frozen food, I reheat. I have some pryex glass baking dishes (8x9.5)that fit in easily.;owned more than 12 years
47;53.0;5.0;8.0;"I received my first convection oven (Cuisinart) as a gift about 5 yrs. ago, but my family outgrew it. After purchasing and returning the Cooks oven from JC Penney, I was desperate to find another convection oven. This oven was a great choice. The slide-out crumb/drip tray makes it very easy to keep your oven clean. The heavy gauge baking pans (two, 12 X 12 in.) don't warp when heated like most. The motor is whisper quiet. I hate timer dials that tick--this one is so quiet, you hardly hear it ticking. The exterior of the oven gets very warm; however, it cools off very quickly after it's turned off. There is so much room in this oven and it hardly takes up any counter space. I first seen it at Kohl's for $149.99, but purchased it at Kmart for $89.99. By the way, it wasn't even on sale! You won't be disappointed by this oven.";The Best Little Oven
22;54.0;4.0;6.0;"We haven't had a ""toaster oven"" in awhile, so after a few years of listening to complaints I decided to look into a multi-function toaster oven/convection device. When I saw this one included a rotisserie too I was very interested. After reading the reviews it seemed like a solid choice for us. We've had it only a few days but have used it every day. Let me tell you, on hot days like today the little oven saves us from being overheated in the kitchen, even when it's on roasting a chicken for 3 hrs! We've made two chickens (one baked, one rotisserie) and they were great. The one we used with the rotisserie came out so juicy! At first there was a complaint that it didn't toast, and no there aren't any instructions specifically on toasting but we figured it out so it finally meets the toaster oven requirement! We've used it to make baked apples, cookies! Replaces our need for the big oven! I'd recommend getting one if you are interested in these uses.";Great multiple function oven choice
26;55.0;5.0;6.0;This is a very handy oven that works for me in the summer time when I don't want to run the big oven. This is my second purchase of this particular model. The first one lasted 5 years before the knob/thermostat went out. The performance outways the negative. Like that the shelves are adjustable and that you can fit two items in it at the same time. The other brands you could barely fit in one dish. Personally I'm a big fan of Hamilton Beach products and I would recomend this oven to anyone who really cooks.;Very good oven.

30;57.0;2.0;6.0;This is a pretty good oven, but it's very limited on how high it will go in convection mode, as the power is too limited. I've found that it will not go higher than about 325 no matter where the temperature is set, and how long you preheat. The coils stay red hot (an issue with anything on the top shelf) and the temp never goes any higher. It's also too underpowered to really broil anything.;Probelm with max temp on convection
31;58.0;4.0;6.0;"I have had this oven for a few months now. It's higher than a typical toaster oven but it fits on a kitchen counter under cabinets with about 5 inches to spare. It is well insulated and doesn't get too hot on the outside or back. It's best feature is the convection setting, which I use most. There's no point in using the non-convection setting because the convection fan serves to circulate the heat rather than let it rise to the top. I have found that food cooks quite fast using convection. I was able to fit a 12 lb turkey inside and it cooked very rapidly and tasted great. I don't use the oven in my stove anymore. I haven't tried broiling anything yet because my Foreman-type grill cooks so well and quickly. I did try the rotisserie setting and it worked but I don't plan to use it much because a 5 lb chicken took over 2 hours to cook. I'd rather roast a chicken using the convection setting and save electricity. The oven has 2 removable shelves and can cook two 12"" pizzas at once. The main weakness of this oven may be in toasting, because it's height means that, when using the center shelf, the heating elements are relatively far from the bread. It is not billed as a toaster-oven and the directions don't describe toasting. However, I am satisfied with the toast made using the convection setting. Yet someone who likes well-done toast may not like it because to really brown the outside, the bread would have to be in long enough to get pretty dried out. I personally like the light, crisp toast it makes. One minor drawback may be the imperfect fit of the door, leaving a small gap at the top that probably loses some heat. All in all, I'm pretty happy with this oven.";A very good oven
13;59.0;5.0;5.0;We love this oven! We had it in 2 days even though we selected the free shipping option. Amazon is amazing! The oven came to us in tip top shape and was simple to set up and use. The first thing we did was rotisserie a 4lb chicken and it came out so moist. It was the best chicken we have ever tasted. We tend to use the convection setting the most as it is quick....but you do have to adjust the settings. It took us 2 batches of corn bread to get it just right. Cookies turn out great on convection...made oatmeal cookies and they only took 5-6 mins total and were fluffy and golden brown..not burnt on the bottom like my regular oven tends to do. I would recommend this oven to anyone that is single or has a small family and wants the convienance of quick, effecient cooking without heating up the whole house! Oh, I should also note this oven is super quiet! Even the convection feature is quiet. It's great and easy to clean too!;Great Countertop Oven
51;60.0;1.0;7.0;I did not buy this from Amazon-bought it from Kohl's,  mainly for the rotisserie. The rotisserie feature does not work the way it is supposed to. The chicken drags every time it turns. It is very hard to use the rotisserie ensamble in it self- it is junk.  This oven is not big enough to have a rotisserie in it. They also should put a light in it. I have had this oven for 2 months-Thank goodness I only paid Seventy some dollars for it. I would not buy it again. Also-I work alot of food events, working with roasters, I should have known better to buy this oven-I don't like Hamilton Beach Brand Their roaster oven is very hot-hard to control-my least favorite brand. But it is very cheap usually\n$ 40.00 on sale. I would buy Nesco or Kenmore any day over Hamilton Beach.;It is ok for an oven-the rotisserie in it is not good
17;61.0;5.0;5.0;I absolutely love this oven.  I wanted something small and economical, as compared to my large oven.  Since getting it I have not had to heat up my cavernous, energy inefficient, oven yet, it has not disappointed me.  It has cooked pies, stuffed peppers, mac and cheese and other meals quicker and much more efficiently then my oven.  Having two racks was a nice addition as I have cooked two things at the same time with no problem.  I figure I will only need my large oven for the holidays, to cook a turkey or large pans of food, and that will be it.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!;I love this oven!!!!
39;62.0;1.0;6.0;I purchased this oven toaster because I needed a small appliance to cure my polymer clay beads in, and thought this would do the trick. Unfortunately the door did not close properly, there was a gap when the door was closed through which the heat escaped. Consequently, the oven did not keep a constant temperature, something which is of utmost importance when curing polymer clay. The oven was also very tinny, the sides got uncomfortably warm. Unfortunately, althogether an unsatisfactory product for me. I have used other toaster ovens before for the same purpose and never had these problems.;Not satisfactory for my needs
40;63.0;5.0;6.0;"I bought this because I live in a studio that gives me a counter top range but no oven.  I saw it got some good reviews so I thought I would give it a shot.  Best thought I had in a long time.\n\nI have never used the rotisserie in the oven at all - don't cook anything that would need it.\n\nI have baked, broiled, roasted, braised in this oven now for almost 3 years.  I have never had a problem at all.  I have baked 2 loaves of bread in the pan, baked bread on the pizza accessory in a round loaf and a mini Italian loaf, baked cakes and brownies.  All came out just the way they should.  Reheating pizza with the convection control is excellent and it does not get dried out hard as it does in the microwave.  Did a big Moroccan tagine in a tagine clay pot in the oven with no problem.  I have cooked in glass, clay, tin foil and open on the pizza sheet and on the pan with the rack and all worked with no problems.  Stuck a tinfoil tray on the bottom shelf and put hit water in it when I baked bread to add steam to the process and that worked as well.\n\nOnly complaint is finding the sheet pans or  baguette pans to fit items that are too long.  The oven is approx 12x12 inside so you have to take that into account.  That is the reason for the mini Italian loaf.  The regular pan for it was 17"" long and thus would not fit.\n\nOverall I have to say that you will not find another oven at anywhere near this price that can even come close to what this little workhorse will do.  Highest recommendation.";The little oven that could  - does
54;64.0;3.0;7.0;I bought this at Sam's Club 2 1/2 yrs ago and it was a dandy little oven. A few of my friends bought it, too. Over the past three weeks, we've had a problem with overheating after setting at 325F or 350F, resulting in burned tops of food. The convection feature is questionable. I haven't continued to use that because I didn't see an appreciable difference in time saved or quality of cooking. Next purchase will be without convection. At least this performed well for more than two years.;Lasted 2 1/2 yrs.
23;65.0;5.0;5.0;I bought this over a year ago to replace my other toaster oven that broke after less than a year. I use it most every day for making lunch (pizza bites, french fries etc.) and for dinner if it's small enough to fit in there. I rarely use my oven now so it saves us a ton on AC and on electricity to heat the big oven and it is so much quicker to get to temperature. We use the broiler most of the time but we have used the rotisserie quite a few times and it works great as well. It has been so handy to have an extra oven for the holidays as well. I love the two racks and the ability to put in a full size pizza. I'm not crazy about the pans that came with it (never use the broiler pan) but I do use the flat pans which are OK if you line them with aluminum foil and spray with olive oil. I bought some round Pyrex dishes that fit well in it and I use them all the time. My little boy loves his french fries and I love being able to give him crunchy fries without all the grease and mess not to mention within 10 min from frozen. Buy it if you have the counter space and can keep little hands away (it gets crazy hot on the top and sides) you won't regret this one!;Love it would buy it again!
29;66.0;2.0;5.0;I am extremely disappointed in the oven.  I do not like the fact they say not to use foil....as it interferes with the browning...it does not seem to cook as fast as my old convection countertop.  (it was a faberware and I loved it....took all size pans,) this one is very limited on sizes....and  does not seem to cook as fast as my old  Faberware.  Perhaps I am comparing too much but I had it over 20 years, it finely gave up...and although I paid slightly more it did all the jobs you could ask for.  This oven does not...have not tried the roterisserie and doubt that I will.  Again I would not purchase this the second time...and the reason I did not purchase a Faberware convection was because Amazon did not have one.  Be wary of if..and plan to be disappointed.;disappointment
38;67.0;4.0;5.0;"I've had this oven for SIX YEARS, and it has been a Blessing for one with limited mobility, such as myself. It has operated worry-free, cooking my meals to perfection without supervision, especially when I am unable to be in the kitchen, so I rarely use my full-size oven any more. The convection feature requires a good power source to work safely, but it performs extremely well. It did especially well this past Thanksgiving when my out-of-town guests were arriving and the turkey still was not quite done. I turned on the convector, and wow, the turkey cooked fully in 1/3 the amount of time.\n\nPros: It can cook up to a 10 pound turkey; Cooks multiple items in the oven simultaneously; Accepts all types of baking dishes; Energy Saver: Oven cools off as the cooking process ends; The timer is easily heard from several different rooms. Excellent for people with mobility issues: Easy to turn knobs, good visibility through oven door; place on countertop for easy input/retrieval of food.\n\nCaution: Works like regular electric oven. Use quality potholders and oven mitts to avoid burns.\n\nI plan to buy another Hamilton Beach model when this one needs replacing.";Time-Tested, Quality Product
44;68.0;5.0;5.0;I've had this oven for about two years now and it is probably the most used thing in my kitchen.  It's also a real bonus, having an extra oven for large cooking jobs like Thanksgiving dinner.  We use it for cooking just about anything.  The only negative thing I have found is that the temperature is not accurate.  However, I have a small oven thermometer resting on the rack inside and it is easy to regulate.  One big plus -- having two racks to cook on.  Most of the other toaster ovens have only one.\n\nIn summary, if it stopped working tomorrow, I'd order another one right away.  We love it.;Love it!
52;69.0;5.0;5.0;I bought this oven when I moved into a very small apartment with only a hotplate and microwave for cooking.  I used it to make casseroles, pizzas, banana bread, chicken, fish, etc. and it worked very well for me.  Now its my back-up oven but I have never regretted buying this oven - I definitely got my money's worth!;My only oven for 2 years
58;70.0;5.0;5.0;"great mutiple baking options; heats quickly; has a timer or a stay on feature; very lightweight oven and is easy to lift or move; easy for a group to use, such as in an employee lunch room; WATCH OUT though, as the outside metal surface areas of the oven also reach extreme heat as you're cooking.

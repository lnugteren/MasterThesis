0;58;31;0.8729213747925959;i have had this oven for a few months now it s higher than a typical toaster oven but it fits on a kitchen counter under cabinets with about 5 inches to spare it is well insulated and does n t get too hot on the outside or back it s best feature is the convection setting which i use most there s no point in using the non convection setting because the convection fan serves to circulate the heat rather than let it rise to the top i have found that food cooks quite fast using convection i was able to fit a 12 lb turkey inside and it cooked very rapidly and tasted great i do n t use the oven in my stove anymore i have n t tried broiling anything yet because my foreman type grill cooks so well and quickly i did try the rotisserie setting and it worked but i do n t plan to use it much because a 5 lb chicken took over 2 hours to cook i d rather roast a chicken using the convection setting and save electricity the oven has 2 removable shelves and can cook two 12 pizzas at once the main weakness of this oven may be in toasting because it s height means that when using the center shelf the heating elements are relatively far from the bread it is not billed as a toaster oven and the directions do n t describe toasting however i am satisfied with the toast made using the convection setting yet someone who likes well done toast may not like it because to really brown the outside the bread would have to be in long enough to get pretty dried out i personally like the light crisp toast it makes one minor drawback may be the imperfect fit of the door leaving a small gap at the top that probably loses some heat all in all i m pretty happy with this oven
1;3;68;0.8659202076935382;actual rating 4 1 2 stars a half point deduction for door misalignment the door does n t seal like it s suppose to it s not really a seal but a much larger gap than allowed either the the frame or the door is slightly warped a minor error however as it still bakes near perfectly and i did n t detected any real heat escaping i still consider the build of the oven very good n ni tested all features and they work excellent convection is very good and cooks much faster and is quiet much more quiet than the toastmaster convection which was extremely noisy this feature is also handy for quick warm ups or making bread rise the rotisserie also works very good you must tie the the chicken up well however n nthe timer does not exactly stop on zero it seems to go on 2 minutes or more again a minor thing just compensate for this it could be because the timer is also the on off switch n nusing a drugstore temperature gauge i found the reading between the gauge and the oven off by about 25 50 degrees however everything cooks excellent using the oven degree markings no undercooked items in fact this thing cooks much faster than recommended time in most recipes sometimes much faster for instance on its rotisserie feature i found a 3 1 2 pound chicken could of been done about 15 minutes or more earlier than the recommended 2 hours a roll recipe i found bakes about 25 faster than the recipe called for and i did n t even use the convection feature for either note the oven degree reading and the drugstore temp gauge reading were the same when using the convection feature n none caveat i did find the the broil feature slightly weak for red meats it more like bakes it but it did cook the fish nicely crisp skin at near exact recommened times n nwhen using this oven over 400 degrees the sides and top of the oven gets hot including the controls i must note this oven has no insulation of any kind it also has no oven light but one is not really needed but it would be nice n nincludes a pamphlet type cookbook that is only a guide but it does give sample recipes for every feature enough to get you started on what it is capable of includes two racks a roast pan with separate grill rack and a aluminium pizza pan with small holes througout for handy cleanups the bottom of the oven can be easily pulled out and washed n nto give you some idea of its size it can handle a 12 pizza two if you have another of its pizza pan though i never tried it the rotisserie can handle up to a 5lb chicken the oven a 7lb roast chicken the oven interior is about 12 front to back not including curved glass door about 13 side to side and about 10 from top burner coil to bottom burner coil with each coil about 1 4 to 1 away from the metal surface respectively the roast pan that comes with it has an inside dimension excluding the lips of about 11 1 2 by 9 3 4 n noverall a very good small oven for the price
2;25;27;0.8507393556715338;this is a great oven due to it s proportions that allow larger items than most of the tabletop convection ovens i ve seen advertised because it s more square than rectangular it has baked enamel inside so no fumes from teflon like coatings an aspect which i found hard to find in these types of ovens this is more an oven than a toaster oven because the elements are too far apart for two sided toasting putting it on broil at 375 degrees crisps bread on one side n nmine is still running after 4 years the temperature could be more accurate but i bought a cheap oven thermometer that i can see through the glass front to make any adjustments the front door has warped some and does n t hang completely straight anymore but it s negligible from the tiny purposeful door stop on the left it looks to have been designed to not seal completely but i do n t feel much heat escaping the front you can not put anything on the glass door when it s open my counter is too short to allow the door handle to support the door when the oven is open and this may have contributed to the door hanging crooked in the end by stressing the hinges you are n t supposed to put anything on the door while it s open either but that turned out not to be an issue since i always put my items on the stove or hot pad n ni have mine under a cabinet and the warmth from the top has not affected the cabinet at all the front gets warm but the sides do not the rotisserie would only be for small things i found that you had to be sure a small chicken was put on securely with nothing hanging or it would sag and drag on each revolution a large roaster would be awkward n nthe convection aspect works really well for baking i hope to use it for dehydrating in the near future as well a good dehydrator with metal racks and metal box to avoid plastic fumes is really expensive and the merchants are n t eager to tell you a convection oven like this will do the job at a much lower price n none of the grills conveniently insets into the baking pan i used the grill with the pan so much it wore through to the copper underneath so i would use a special scrubbing sponge to prolong it losing it s coating i still use the grill n nit has a wind down timer sometimes turning it to the end then to the time i want will help it ding at the end n nit s almost funny but despite it s minor foibles with the door timer and temperature it s actually a straight forward useful oven at a great price
3;47;41;0.8397787313073211;i bought this oven a little over a month ago from walmart com with site to store delivery it s cheaper but takes 3 weeks to arrive at the store it does n t come with a pizza pan but two shallow baking pans more like cookie sheets they re aluminum so the heat makes them curl up when you use them they work fine though i cover them in foil to make cleanup easier i baked a 5 chicken on the rotisserie it came out nice and tender it took 3 hours and i used a pop up so i would n t overcook it i did n t have the weight of the chicken centered although i followed the instructions use kitchen string to tie the chicken real tight i used dental floss that was all i had and could n t get it tight enough the chicken legs and breast kept hitting the pan underneath i finally took the pan out and just let the crumb tray catch the drippings it just barely contained the drippings everytime the breast was in the down position the rotisserie hesitated before continuing on it s rotation when the breast was in the up position the rotisserie sped up a bit it did n t affect the cooking at all but i imagine it could wear on the motor after awhile i baked a freshetta pizza and it turned out better than when i used a regular oven more moist i used the convection setting for that i ve also baked asparagus and that turned out real good i baked a frozen enchilada on convection and did n t allow for the shortened cook time so i overcooked it after using the oven and letting it cool it was easy to wipe down i really like the oven i use it every couple of days
4;63;40;0.8386867901160268;i bought this because i live in a studio that gives me a counter top range but no oven i saw it got some good reviews so i thought i would give it a shot best thought i had in a long time n ni have never used the rotisserie in the oven at all do n t cook anything that would need it n ni have baked broiled roasted braised in this oven now for almost 3 years i have never had a problem at all i have baked 2 loaves of bread in the pan baked bread on the pizza accessory in a round loaf and a mini italian loaf baked cakes and brownies all came out just the way they should reheating pizza with the convection control is excellent and it does not get dried out hard as it does in the microwave did a big moroccan tagine in a tagine clay pot in the oven with no problem i have cooked in glass clay tin foil and open on the pizza sheet and on the pan with the rack and all worked with no problems stuck a tinfoil tray on the bottom shelf and put hit water in it when i baked bread to add steam to the process and that worked as well n nonly complaint is finding the sheet pans or baguette pans to fit items that are too long the oven is approx 12x12 inside so you have to take that into account that is the reason for the mini italian loaf the regular pan for it was 17 long and thus would not fit n noverall i have to say that you will not find another oven at anywhere near this price that can even come close to what this little workhorse will do highest recommendation
5;13;24;0.7506973695266652;could n t help but notice how the whole exterior quickly got too hot to touch little or no insulation inside meant it wasted a lot of heat though if it s a cold day it s not really wasted it s helping to heat your house n ni read some reviews claiming this oven burst into flames well just how does metal and glass burn probably some people should stay away from hot as well as sharp objects n nalso read about quartz heating elements it has regular heating elements other people should stay away from the review button n ngetting basic product info nowdays is like pulling teeth ninterior 12 5 inches deep 12 5 inches wide 10 inches between top and bottom heating elements 1500 watts nexterior is about 19 5 inches wide 14 inches high 17 inches deep with the handle in front and some odd plastic hooks protruding from rear the footpads are 10 inches apart front to back and 16 inches apart side to side this oven is going to make nearby objects hot n nnice big clear glass door has me worried i m going to ram a pan into it thinking it s open an interior light would be nice at times but a flashlight works n nall the functions work properly though the lower rear heating elements glows a little fainter on the right few inches n ncomes with two 12 5 x12 5 pans and one grill that fits the pans two slide in grill racks rotisserie forks shaft and hot chicken removal thing that lifts each end of the shaft n ni m not much for cooking so i can only say that this oven really beats the old microwave for cooking frozen pizzas and hot pockets not quite as fast but the crusts now get crisp and firm instead of soft and doughy and i can do 2 pizzas or 6 hot pockets at a time n nouch careful wiping the bottom under the crumb tray sharp edge nasty cut n nafter a year and a half the timer broke i can wind it but it just unwinds right away so i m using a battery powered digital timer with it
6;23;21;0.7250664489928463;this is my 2nd hamilton beach 31197 with convection and rotisserie i had the 1st one for 10 years n nput a 5 pork or beef roast on the spit season to taste and let the rotisserie do its magic put in one or 2 8x8 baking pans for cake or brownies and prepare for a treat n nbroil steaks burgers sausages or bacon using the large tray and wire rack that come with it n nwant to bake 2 12 pizzas enjoy n nthe caveats n ndo n t have the rack toooo high for broiling or you will get flares of flame do n t panic if that happens just switch it off and lower the rack a notch n ndo clean well after each use let it cool down to room temp and then use soapy water and a sponge to wash and a wet rag to rinse 2 3 times then wipe dry stay away from the scrubbers and chemicals this thing sits right up there on your counter top which makes it easy to access and keep clean n nthe unit will get hot of course so be sure cloth and paper are not on or against it while in use n nfor some the fact that it does not make toast will be a drawback for me the purchase of a 10 toaster is worth it to have all these other attributes n ni suspect i ll be looking for another of these in about 10 years
7;29;16;0.6961183264665742;we bought this oven about 18 months ago it is n t pretty it could use some insulation and a tighter door the rotisserie is cheesy but we love it for baking we are two old frugal people with a small high altitude kitchen i bake our weekly bread two loaves at a time no problem cookies are quick on the convection setting and you ca n t bake more than you should eat in one sitting cake mixes take a little work to perfect but baked potatoes beef jerky quiches pies even drying fruit it s all good we park the oven outside for summer baking and love the way it helps heat the kitchen in the winter not as noisy as our last fancy bosch 1500 convection range and the automatic turn off is nice we were n t sure we could live without a regular oven but with this and a couple counter top burners so far so good
8;61;17;0.5629796116733047;i absolutely love this oven i wanted something small and economical as compared to my large oven since getting it i have not had to heat up my cavernous energy inefficient oven yet it has not disappointed me it has cooked pies stuffed peppers mac and cheese and other meals quicker and much more efficiently then my oven having two racks was a nice addition as i have cooked two things at the same time with no problem i figure i will only need my large oven for the holidays to cook a turkey or large pans of food and that will be it love it love it love it

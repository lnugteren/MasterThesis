0;49;75;0.905666036291664;i do n t know what i did before lunch without mr bento i take that back i do know i carried my lunch in gladware containers inside a crumpled up wal mart bag n none has to remember that as this is a japanese product the manufacturer had the interests of japanese consumers in mind when designing this product this lunch jar is made for the typical japanese lunch which usually contains soup rice preserved fish or meat and some pickles you are n t going to find foods that will spoil easily in their lunches such as dairy and many japanese use complimentary pairings to keep food from spoiling ie packing foods with natural antibacterial properties with those that are more perishable it is really quite interesting that being said this does n t mean that mr bento is less than ideal for the western lunch in fact it is quite to the contrary n nthere are workarounds to the problem of the western lunch i have tried a few times to combine hot and cold combinations in the same lunch jar and it has simply never worked for me here s the technique anyway some advise filling the jar up only halfway with boiling water and filling the bottom two containers with boiling water and letting them sit while you prepare your lunch you then heat up your food to go in the bottom two containers until it is steaming hot dump the water out of the containers and immediately fill them up with the hot food and seal the lids tightly you are then supposed to take a small kitchen towel and place it between the top two and bottom two bowls your cold food goes in the top two i find that the laws of physics overrule here heat rises and cold sinks therefore you wind up with a lunch pail full of lukewarm food i have found that it works out better for me to go all the way hot or all the way cold if you have a pail full of hot food and use the boiling water technique mr bento does a decent job keeping your food warm but it wo n t be steaming hot at least not in my experience most of the time this is just not an issue for me anyway because i usually put my mr bento in the break room refrigerator when i get to work however occasionally i float to a different job site which has a microwave but no fridge in this case i keep all the food cold in mr bento and just nuke the applicable containers at lunch time i find this the most convenient method for me it is a lot easier to keep food cold than hot due to the generous size and amount of the mr bento food containers i usuallly have more room than i need for my lunch what i do is buy those blue ice packets that have individual cells think the size of an ice cube on large sheets you can cut out each individual cell and have a nice little size packet of blue ice i find that i can fit nine of these into the larger of the two non insulated containers the second one down from the top then i have the bottom two and the very top container for my lunch i pack everything in the containers and keep them in the fridge overnight except for the container packed with ice which gets stored in the freezer i even keep the outer stainless steel container in the fridge so it stays nice and cold in the morning i just assemble everything together which takes less than a minute and i m out the door whenever i open my lunch five hours later it is alway still cold n nas i mentioned before i find that mr bento has ample room for my lunch i usually reserve the bottom two containers for my lunch components and the top container holds an afternoon snack the beauty of mr bento for me is how creative it has made me become when packing my lunches i know this sounds corny but for me lunch is more than just lunch now it is an experience i look forward to packing my lunches every evening and challenging myself with new ways to fill mr bento most of the time it is just leftovers but i am always looking for little things to sneak into my lunch i have found that i am eating a lot more vegetables simply because the many containers lend themselves so well to variety i usually put cut fruit in the top container or cheese and crackers for a snack the mini baybel cheeses and laughing cow cheese wedges are perfect for this i usually have a salad in the soup container and an entree in the bottom container sloppy joes and other sandwiches work perfect with mr bento the bottom largest container is the perfect size to hold a hamburger bun the filling goes in the soup container and you just assemble it at lunchtime i have even done soft tacos many times simply put your hot fillings in the soup container your lettuce tomato etc in the bottom container and sour cream salsa etc in one of the other containers just wrap your tortillas in some plastic wrap and they fit perfectly inside the fabric case wrapped around the outer lunch jar you can do the same for burritos wraps and pita sandwiches there is also a pocket on the outside where you can keep packets of salt and pepper soy sauce hot sauce etc i keep a packet of emergen c in mine my mr bento came with chopsticks but i do n t find this to be a problem at all sometimes i use the chopsticks especially if i am having noodles but when i need western utensils i simply replace the chopsticks with a fork and or spoon wrapped in a napkin works perfectly n nmr bento is also very stylish looking i like the black carrying case with strap it compliments my bag and business attire very nicely it certainly looks a lot nicer than toting into the office a crumpled up wal mart bag with gladware inside n noverall mr bento is a very versatile product and accomodates my lunchtime needs very nicely
1;71;39;0.8994637987309263;at the time of this review i ve just finished my first lunch from it if i feel so inclined i ll certainly add more notes to this in the future after it s gotten some heavier use so far though so good n ni ve been losing some weight and i want to keep that up i also found out recently that for work i m going to be moving from the building that i m in which has a cafeteria into a different building without a cafeteria i ll be needing to bring my lunch then it s far too costly to keep going out to lunch every day that all said this product has 2 purposes for me portion control for weight loss and eating healthier and money savings since it s so much cheaper to make your own food than to go out and eat not to mention gas parking issues as well n ni received the container on monday dec 31 2012 and washed it yesterday to use today jan 2 2013 last night before bed i put the following items into it bowls are from bottom up n n 1 bottom soup 9oz bowl a slice of smoked pork loin that i made monday n 2 lower middle main 15oz bowl bean soup that i also made on monday n 3 upper middle large side 10oz bowl some chex mix n 4 top small side 7oz bowl some smoked apple slices that i made on monday n nif you actually read that above you will see my mistake the bottom bowl is meant for soup not the top one i read everything too just did n t retain and last night i was hungry for soup so i wanted it in the biggest bowl what s good to know is that although there was some spillage there was only very little i carried it upright for the most part but when i got into my car to come to work i threw my laptop and the lunch bag into the back seat so it was on its side for about 45 minutes in the car the gravy in the bottom bowl did not spill even a drop though so it looks like that bowl will be great for liquids tomorrow i ll switch the containers that the loin and the soup are in there s too much food anyway n n heat retention nplease see the notes below that i ve taken straight from the zojirushi web site but not on the amazon page on this product n n heat retention after 6 hours 153f n cold retention after 6 hours 50f n color lemon yellow apple red gun metalic silver n n rating is based on water at a starting temperature of 203f 95c n at a room temperature of 68f 20c n rating is based on water at a starting temperature of 40f 4c n at a room temperature of 68f 20c n nfirst i m assuming they used the bottom soup bowl for this it definitely had the best heat retention for the 2 bowls that it s intended for soup and large main bowl my pork loin was still really warm and the soup was warn but not as much after i packed the bowls i put them into the refrigerator without the main container this morning i took the tops off of the hot food bowls and put them into the microwave for a couple of minutes making them hot but nothing crazy like the 203f they listed above i put the lids back on and put everything into place into the container and left shortly therearfter that was about 7 10 am i got to work and left the lunch container on my desk not in the refrigerator until about 11 30 am when i got hungry so 4 hours 20 minutes i d say all together the soup bowl kept the pork loin about 80 as hot as it started and the larger bowl kept my soup about 60 as hot as it was for me this is good i do n t like food to be super hot anyway and like i said i did n t start off with it at some crazy heat anyway n nas far as the top two containers they were both pretty much room temperature inside as advertised as they were snacks i was n t trying to keep them cold note that only the bottom 2 containers will retain heat or cold levels at all the top two are not insulated and are intended to maintain temperatures that are found outside of the unit i ve read that heating or cooling the lids ahead of time also help to retain temperatures you desire i ll try that myself too n n size weight nso i ve seen some reviews where people are complaining that the size of the thing is too large and others that say it s too small some say it s not heavy others say it is way too heavy obviously this is going to be a perosnal choice and i d rather give you some details and let you make your decision based on those not other people s opinions that may not be your own n nfrom the zojirushi web site ndimensions w x d x h 6 x 5 3 8 x 8 3 4 inches n nthe width of 6 is at its widest point which includes the clips on the sides the depth of 5 3 8 must be the smaller area without the clips but that s not correct the width of the tube itself the top and the bottom is just 5 the 8 3 4 height is not correct it s actually 8 1 2 tall not a big deal i know but i m trying to be literal here i have no idea why their dimensions are off but i m sure my ruler is n t wrong n nto me the size of the thing is perfectly fine but i knew how big it would be based on reading reviews and seeing the dimensions listed i do n t mind that it s acutally slightly smaller than advertised either the listed weight is 2 07 pounds including the bag per their web site i did n t weigh it but sure that seems right with the food that i put in it i d think i added less than 1 2 a pound so 2 5 pounds total for lunch i do n t see that as a problem whatsoever plus the bag is very handy and has a long strap which has no problems carrying the weight n n cleaning nthis is one of my main concerns with this and i ll probably just have to deal with it i cleaned out the soup bowl a little while ago after i started writing this review in fact and it washed out very nicely and easy the soup was dark the bowl was white and there s no stains or any leftover residue that was hard to clean up i ll take care of the others when i get home but that s where the concern is normally with any lunch i may bring it s in separate containers from rubbermade or ziplock or whatever those can go in the dishwasher so clean up is a breeze this stuff is n t supposed to go into the dishwasher though which is the one thing i do n t like since i only have one of these i would n t be washing it in the dishwasher every day anyway but i wo n t be bringing this to work every single day and just because it s a little more sanitary i do like to wash things in the dishwasher now and then to make sure it s very clean for instance i bring my coffee cup from work home once or twice a month just to run it through a cycle i do n t have those options with this which is probably why i have 4 stars instead of 5 n ni really do n t understand how something can be microwave safe holding starting temps just over 200f per their own web site ca n t handle a dishwasher now a quick online search of dishwasher temperatures show that they are generally in the 140 150 range but that dishwashers with heating elements can bring it up quite a bit higher if you have them dry the dishes themselves i do n t do this because it really does n t seem to actually dry the dishes anyway you d think a warning like dishwasher safe top rack and air dry only would suffice but i have to wonder if there are other reasons another reviewer on this product here said they lost the valve on the soup bowl because they always wash the parts in the dishwasher so i d think it does work fine in the dishwasher but do n t take that statement as the truth from me please i may try it out myself just to see and if i do i ll add a comment to this review later to let you know how it went n n overall quality nthis is a big plus this unit seems to be made extremely well the clips are strong and the lids stay on tight the large main container and soup bowl lids were a little tough to take off but i did screw them on tight n nthe spoon probably easily looked over is actually pretty nice for an addon or value added item i like that it comes with a hard plastic cover that snaps on plus there s a place for it inside of the bag as well which helps it to stay in place the bag comes with it another very nice feature that i really do n t think i d expect them to put with it honestly i d expect most companies to add it as something you can buy for another 10 or whatever so kudos to zojirushi for these two things n n final words ni really do like this lunch container so far and the only issue i have with it as i stated above is that the containers are n t dishwasher safe at least they say they are n t but they re microwave safe just does n t make sense othewise it s a fantastic product and i recommend it to anyone who thinks they d use it that is after all the key right n n d
2;23;131;0.8764379950132984;i like to eat healthy home cooked food when travelling and for such occassions mr bento is great the quality of this product is fantastic as is the case with all zojirushi products i own it s nice they have started to offer instructions in english mine were japanese only and unfortunately i did n t know that you re not supposed to microwave with the lids on or put containers in the dish washer many thanks to the reviewer who shared those notes n nthe insulation on this product is great it ll keep food warm for more than 4 hours i ve enjoyed warm meals during long plane flights with the bento it may not keep things hot but certainly warm it can also alternatively keep things cool n ninterestingly the lid of the device is thin plastic and is not insulated so the insulation is most effective in the lower compartments which traditionally would hold soup and rice n ni have had some challenges trying to have both warm and cold items the ability to keep chilled is great if you make a meal the night before put it in the fridge then use the keep cold capability to keep food cool for the commute to work then warm the food at work however the lack of insulation at the top for example may allow hot food to get cold on a cold day or cold items like a fresh salad to get hot on a hot day hot and cold together is likewise a major challenge as the heat from the lower items will cause the upper items to get warm again making it quite difficult to have a hot item with a salad n nnot suprisingly the mr bento seems best suited for the traditional japanese type of meal soup in the bottom rice in the next level and some pickled vegetables eaten at room tempurature above that for such a configuration it works perfectly but for some more american style meals there can be challenges n nthe use of plastic for the containers is unfortunate because it s porous that means the containers may take on the color and smell and flavor of the foods placed in them particularly if the food is strong like a rich indian curry for example also when heating the foods or placing hot foods various toxic and cancer causing chemicals from the plastic may leech into the food it would therefore be really nice if this could be made with stainless steel containers instead of plastic n nthis review is intended to give a feeling for some aspects of the bento all challenges and concerns aside i ve had my mr bento for several years and am always grateful for it becuase it makes it possible to carry food in a very convenient way and thereby to eat well when travelling
3;88;62;0.8731327760751583;leave it to the japanese to innovate sack lunches n ni purchased this lunch kit after seeing a co worker many years ago with a nissan version i have a zojirushi rice cooker so i know they make quality stuff after re reading the reviews between the mr bento and the nissan version i bought the mr bento b c of the volume of favorable reviews as well as other tangibles such as the carrying case spoon and the cool design n nproduct wise i am very happy despite some negative reviews about it not being insulated i really do n t understand what they are talking about we have an electric water kettle that i fill up the night before to about 4 cups when i go downstairs for breakfast i flip the switch and take my bento containers out that i want to heat up in the microwave i ll eat my yogurt or breakfast in the meantime when the water is done i ll pour the water into mr bento and allow it to sit for about 5 to 10 minutes at the tail end of the water time i ll microwave my food for about 2 3 minutes then i ll dump the water and put the food into the container i have had some late lunches 2 to 3pm on occasion and the food was still warm hot hot enough to eat n none thing you ll notice is that you will think that you are not eating enough but once you dig into your own lunches you will probably not be very hungry you can pack alot of food perhaps we americans are so used to being overfed when we buy lunch outside n nin terms of design here are my two gripes 1 the bottom most soup container can be a real bear to open sometimes esp when it is damp and or tightly closed 2 i wish the top closable dome lid was metal like the body of the mr bento plastic dome cheap similarly i wish the latch clasps were metal plastic wear n nthe nice bag is a great value add if you ca n t tell there are two extra pouches sewed onto the outside great for sauce packets or mid meal snacks n ntips 1 i cut out an old metallic bubble type car shade into a circle and use it as an insulation barrier for the hot and the cold food personally i think it makes a big difference if you do the same make sure that the circle is slightly bigger than the cylinder itself so you get a good seal 2 cut your food into bite sized pieces cutting anything inside these containers is not easy esp the taller one on that note i purchased a boker snacpac as someone recommended b c of the portability of the entire utensil set the knife is the only good thing about it the spoon is useless for anything but stirring a french espresso in a little cup the fork is way too narrow so i just use the supplied mr bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice 3 if you have foods or sauces that you think might stain consider lightly oiling the surface with your fingers or use saran wrap to line the inside which is what i do n nspare parts yes they do have them and for just about every part including container lids i will post up the reply i received from a nice zojirushi representative at a later date n noh yeah i have been losing a little weight b c now i am in control of my meals not to mention with gas prices the way they are now every little kind of money saving activities like packing lunch helps in the end
4;40;83;0.8674857308902102;before buying mr bento i ve searched all the other lunch boxes offered by amazon and analyzed how i would use it being an engineer these things interest me i chose mr bento over the thermos model since i really liked the idea of having hot and room temperature food all in the same container from reviews of the thermos brand it keeps all the containers warmer than mr bento i liked it so much after a week of use that i bought a second one so that i can pre pack dry food for multiple days n nthermal capacity is really good when i pre heat the sleeve and bottom two containers with boiling water with bottom container full of near boiling liquid soup it is still very hot five hours later and keeps the main container warm enough without hot soup there bottom two containers are warm but not as hot as i would like it to be when i m not packing soup i would fill the soup bowl with boiling water which keeps the main container nice and hot n nthe top two smaller pop top containers are meant for room temperature food though the bottom of the two gets a bit warm i found that using a micro fiber towel cut to fit to separate between the hot and cool containers help the upper containers stay closer to room temperature without the towel separation my tomatoes and cherries packed in the bottom of the two pop top containers out of the refrigerator gets a bit warm i have not yet used it to pack cold food in all the containers but would expect to be perform better than hot food application due to lesser temperature difference n ni did find that soup bowl gets a bit hard to turn when tightened hard and when the container is wet but found that pulling on the top as opening helps upper two pop top type containers are better sealing than the reviews indicate n ncarry bag is definitely very cool and functional though it makes me swing it around as i m carrying it containers do n t leak if used per manufacturer s directions it allows me to pack some health bars and napkins as well as put a fruit packet or one additional pop top containers on top and close it up making it almost five container mr bento for long days in the office it can be used to carry real spoon if you are not happy with the spork imho not as nice as using a real spoon spork is very nice stainless steel made in japan and great back up when i forget to pack utensils n nafter using for over a month would agree with other reviewers that this is really a great item and would last quite a long time with mr bento nissan thermos full of home roasted americano style coffee i m ready to hit the work hard at the office and do n t have to worry about keeping my stomach happy to those home packing to lose weight trying to eat healthier meals or just sick of cafeteria food or fast food mr bento will be a great investment
5;1;93;0.8623545415134898;it s a great lunchbox if you adapt your menu to it n nfirst the description n nthe lunchbox is a thermos jar with a non insulated plastic top there are four containers that fit into the jar in a specific order n n the bottom container is a insulated bowl it has a gasket sealed screw on top insulated side walls and a small vent for pressure the most insulative of the bunch it is designed for soup or other liquids n n the next container is the biggest it has a slide and lock insulated top n n the third container is notably smaller and has a tupperware like pop top n n the fourth container is smaller yet and has the same top n nyou stack the containers in the jar and then clip the top on with little side clips the whole thing then goes in a nice nylon carry bag that also has a pair of chopsticks in a narrow plastic box there are little pockets on the side for extra sauce packets or condiments or i pod video s to watch while your eating lunch n nthis unit is optimally designed for the japanese style lunch a soup rice entr eacute e and pickled salted vegetables normally you d put your soup in the bottom container fill the middle container up with rice your entr eacute e would go in the third and the veggies in the fourth since the soup and the rice container both have insulated tops they stay warm the other containers are not insulated and neither is the top this allows some heat coming off the bottom two containers to escape so that your veggies are at room temperature understanding this is important its not supposed to keep the entire meal at the same temperature its supposed to keep one part hot and the other part at room temperature n ni ve found that in real use the soup container stays steaming hot the stuff in the rice container stays warm but not hot the stuff in the top two containers heats up to room temperature maybe a little bit more n nnaturally you do n t have to use it as designed soup rice entr eacute e veggie but departures require a little bit adaptation and creativity you need to balance both amounts and what you want to keep the hottest vs coolest also if you have access to a microwave at lunch it kind of makes this not quite as useful since you could just heat your food up there as opposed to heating it up in the morning before you go you could use the whole thing as a cooler everything remains cold cool till you heat up what you want that might be a better way to go if your using it for the office n nthe size of the room temperature containers is not large enough to handle american sized sandwiches and breads so if your looking to take that traditional lunch box stuff this is n t the best unit for that n nif your looking to make the most of this unit you might check out some bento box cookbooks they give receipies and menu sets more in line with what this is designed to handle in particular i enjoyed the book bento boxes by naomi kijima n n a data hook product link linked class a link normal href bento boxes japanese meals on the go dp 4889960732 ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 bento boxes japanese meals on the go a n ni ll cook something up out of that and thrown in a packet of instant miso soup for a japanese style lunch n npros n ncompact and efficient use of space it all goes in the tube no bag full of different containers n nallows for two temperatures in the same container allows for flexible combinations n nlots of interesting comments from your co workers n ncons n ncleanup is a bit of a pain not dishwasher safe the soup top is a little tricky at times n nsoft plastic will eventually pick up strong smells stains n ntwo temperatures in the same container requires a little creativity does n t keep everything uniformly hot cold n nconclusion n nas long as you understand how it works and adapt it s a great product might encourage you to cook a bit more healthy food and eat more vegetables
6;65;34;0.8503990947794997;okay people seems like there has been a lot of folks giving this a low rating because they did n t know exactly what they were getting when they bought the mr bento not the product s fault because someone misread or did n t read the description or even the instructions on how to use it properly so maybe this can help clarify as to what the mr bento can and can not do before someone buys it n nthe bowls are all bpa free plastic only the outside of the jar is stainless steel the description is a bit misleading i do n t believe any of the zojirushi lunch jars have stainless steel lunch bowls would n t be microwavable if they were n nthe containers are not leakproof with the exception of the soup container and the lids can not go into the microwave these were the reasons why i only gave it a 4 star rating it would be nice if zoji could come up with a model that does have all leakproof bowls we can work around the no lid in the microwave aspect n ni ve tested all 4 bowls and although the soup container is leakproof would n t recommend letting it roll around loose or play catch with it just to be on the safe side granted i would n t do that with any of my other leakproof containers either n nthis is either a hot or cold container that means you can either keep a hot meal warm or a cold meal cold not both together some common sense here folks put a hot item next to a cold item in an insulated container will not keep each item hot or cold the review that said it allows for two temperatures in the same container is technically true but he does n t say that it will keep them the same temperature as when they went in sorry there is just no way around the physics so if you want a hot and cold meal but no way of heating up the container s this will not work for you there are other ways to do this one suggestion i ve added at the end of this review n nmy husband s lunches usually contain some part that needs to be heated up so i use mr bento mainly as a cold jar works great because i no longer have to put an ice pack in his lunch bag to keep his lunch cold what i do is put together his lunch the night before put all the containers into the jar and everything goes into the fridge in the morning pull it out into the bag and off he goes fruit salad and side salad stay cold and he just heats up the main dish and or soup n nlunches vary small side container has some kind of small side pickles veggie salad stuff this is a very small container holds only 7 oz that s just less than a cup n nlarge side container is not a whole lot bigger than the small side just a bit more than a cup holds usually a fruit salad wo n t hold a lot of whole larger type of fruit such as strawberries or large grapes i just cut the larger pieces to fit more in n nthe main bowl not leakproof contains some kind of protein sometimes steamed white rice depending on the meal this is the largest container of the four and holds 15 oz just shy of 2 cups do n t expect this to hold a steak and be used with a steak knife and fork not how it was meant to be used nor is it meant to fit a whole sandwich in it it s a mr bento not a mr sandwich container n nthe soup bowl leakproof does n t always get used but i ve put rice porridge and an additional salad or more rice if i need to use the main bowl for the protein this holds 9 oz just a bit over a cup n nhere are the capacities of the containers for reference listed in the order they come out of the jar top down n nsmall side bowl 7 oz nlarge side bowl 10 oz nmain bowl 15 oz nsoup bowl 9 oz n nyes this is not for anyone who need larger meals zorijushi does have bento jars with larger bowls the classic bento has a main bowl that holds 20 oz and a side bowl that holds 14 oz with the same size soup bowl if you need an even larger main bowl the classic stainless lunch jar will hold up to 27 oz almost 3 5 cups n nfor someone who want both hot and cold items together one suggestion is using zoji s single food jar for hot which holds a good 25 oz then use one of the smaller bentos like ms bento for the cold items yes more containers to lug around but you might be able to fit both jars in a larger insulated bag n ncheck out zojirushi s website for more details on all their lunch jars you can even do a compare on the different models that s what i did before buying this model
7;108;54;0.8286617600680266;the zojirushi mr bento is an excellent product so long as you have the information you need to know what you re getting and how to use it n nwrapped in an easy carry bag you get the mr bento jar and a spoon though i prefer to carry chopsticks this jar is somewhat thermos like but it s not meant to keep coffee scalding hot for hours it s meant to keep a japanese lunch ready from morning to lunchtime a role it s perfectly designed for inside the mr bento jar are four serving dishes the bottom bowl is intended for a soup or broth and has a screw on lid for that purpose the next and larger bowl is intended to keep rice warm and has a non spill proof top two smaller bowls are intended to hold an entree protein and a side item vegetables these items are not dishwasher or microwave safe as the food is intended to be prepared warm in the morning and served as it is at lunch the bottom soup bowl keeps the rice warm which in turn keeps the meat at a good temperature which in turn does n t get warm enough to hurt your vegetables it s a pretty smart system really n nsize seems an issue at first glance the jar is only about six inches wide and a little taller and the bowls therefore fit into an even smaller space the total serving space is 41 6 ounces and most westerners will scoff at this it s easily only half the space of a traditional lunch box however the wonderful secret of this jar is that this space is actually enough room to fit a meal fit for front line combat troops if you know how to use it n nconverted to millileters the standard measurement system for bento capacity this jar contains 1 230ml of food in a standard japanese layout the size of a bento roughly corresponds to the calories contained thus this bento can contain about 1 200 calories if all you re filling it with is the standard soup rice meat veggie layout the same containers could easily store chili sandwich steak dessert skyrocketing the calorie count thus mr bento can easily hold a full 2 3 times the calories a child would need for a meal and well over what any adult should need your problem using the jar therefore is n t trying to cram a meal into it it s realizing that you actaully need to underfill it a little to eat healthy and oh how you ll rethink your portion sizes once you see the difference n nthere are a few downsides to mr bento that are worth mentioning first up is the obvious problem of the format the soup jar is the only really spillproof unit so you re a little limited in how you can mix up your foods the system is also designed so the food shares heat as described above if you want to mix hot foods and cold desserts in the same container you re going to have to do some experimentation to see how much the heat transfers through the day although it s easy to build a reverse temperature system with a cold soup up to warm meats or etc there s also the non dishwasher safe bit which may or may not be an issue for you the small vented lid for the soup can be a little hard to pop out and clean but if you use chopsticks like me the solution is obvious n nas many have suggested this is an excellent alternative to other ways of carrying lunch search up any of the fine bento cookbooks amazon offers and dig in you ll spend a little bit extra time and thought in food preparation to use this item but when you do the health and energy and focus benefits of eating with this system are just too good to pass up
8;124;56;0.8250289101440254;i think i was attracted to the idea of the mr bento mainly because of its neat look i really hate shlepping a shopping bag of mismatched tupperware and reused cool whip tubs the size is comparable to a 2 liter of soda possibly shorter as previous reviews have mentioned the carrying bag must be utilized as there are no handles the containers are an unappetizing grey which quickly turn orange in the presence of ketchup i now use either fast food packets of the stuff or a reusable cupcake liner for acidic condiments the soup containers retain heat relatively well the entree container not so much even when you follow the manufacturer s instructions and preheat containers in hot water nother reviewers claim that this is ideal for the traditional japanese lunch which may be true i tend to eat a great deal of indian and middle eastern food which i do not recommend in the mr bento as it will absorb some of the flavors and you can no longer use a container that once held a curry dish to hold cottage cheese down the road unless you like a curried cottage cheese n non the bright side someone in the forum contacted customer service there are no bpas in the plastic so at least it is non toxic n ni do believe that it could be useful for exactly what it was intended for a traditional japanese meal but it is not versatile enough to meet my needs
9;47;51;0.7884455441574604;we had purchased the ms bento for our toddler s day care lunch which is a perfect size for a tot not a ms unless you re on a diet so we thought of getting this one for my husband to take food to work npeople complain it is bulky and it is but what can you expect if you want to bring rice soup an entree and some dessert the top to bottom hot to cold design notion is very good if you want a varied lunch rather than just a sandwich or salad nhowever it is so cheaply made that on week one the thermal lid that covers the rice container where we usually put the actual entree popped by popped i do not mean it came off the container the lid itself is a brittle plastic shell holding a disk of plain styrofoam this is your insulation and the top of the plastic cylinder came right off during washing it did n t even take a hit letting the styrofoam out we have been unable to fit it back with glue or any other means so now the biggest container in this set is absolutely useless nfurthermore as some other reviewers said the plastic it s made of is very hard to clean and retains odor while this is true of many plastic containers whatever plastic they are using here seems to hold on to oil even more than usual it takes so many rounds of soap and hot water to clean the containers well that it makes me feel guilty to use them nat this point this whole bulky set is gathering dust in a corner of our pantry we have substituted the nissan stainless steel 10 oz containers for our warm stuff they can not go in the microwave but you if you preheat with hot water for five six minutes before putting your food in the food will be hot until lunch and fit fresh plastic containers of different sizes which include icepacks fitting the lids for our yogurt desser other cold stuff that might need refrigeration this makes a flexible set and combined with an insulated lunch bag it has proven easier to fit in our bag the zojirushi is great in volume but i think the cylindrical shape is what makes it truly impossible to fit in your bag and we have more options to pack our lunch by the way the fit and fresh stuff cleans more easily if that is a plus for you ni am still happy with the ms bento for my toddler although we are trying to move away from it because it is also hard to clean
10;9;18;0.7519616224734198;i bought mr bento for my husband and he has been using it since sept 2015 he works outdoor so this comes handy for the sole purpose of keeping the food warm i do n t mix cold and hot food together so this review is purely on hot food also keep in mind we started to use it when the summer was really hot till now n ntips n n1 to keep the food warm up to 6 hours or so pour boiling water into mr bento minus the containers cover and leave it for 5 minutes after 5 minutes pour the water out and wipe it n2 heat up the containers with food inside in microwave the containers are microwave safe leave the lid out occasionally i forgot and takes me awhile to get them open n3 stack the very hot containers into mr bento n npros the containers may look small but they are surprisingly can feed reasonably big man n ncons they are not leaked proof especially the big container you still can get away with soup or curry in the bottom container just make sure it s really tight n noverall i think it s a good buy
11;94;26;0.7196400052529381;after having this lunch jar for two days i discovered one of the containers leaks i was surprised and i contacted customer service at zojirushi they informed me via email and via phone the container in question was not designed to be leak proof not only that but the two additional containers in the set of 4 were also not designed to be leak proof wait it gets better the soup bowl is designed to release stem enabling water to escape and collect in the stainless steel container the stainless steel container does not have a seal allowing the accumulated water to escape n nin an email from customer support i was told to just make sure the jar never sits on its side and leaking should n t be an issue to think i bought a lunch box that leaks by design n nif you buy this know it leaks and nothing can be done to prevent it
12;76;13;0.6552623822445106;this product is perfection my husband really needed a lunch container and we re glad we went with this one i can easily pack a full course meal with this including soup it s really a great option for anyone who works in a factory this thing can take a beating my husband works 12 16 hour shifts overnight in a hot factory which stays plenty hot overnight despite it being 50 degrees outside if i pack it with cool food it stays cool if i pack it with hot food it stays pretty hot i d say it works well for at least 4 5 hours because that s usually when my husband gets his lunch break n npros n really great compartments and sizing i can fit 2 nice sized chicken breasts a ton of rice with veggies miso other soups and fruits in them n great insulation n takes a bruising my husband has dropped it more than once and it s perfectly fine not even a ding on the thing n ncons n it is not for a kid i have no clue why some people complain that it s too small but trust me this thing is not for your 5 year old this packs plenty of food for a hard working 5 10 180lb man so i see no reason for anyone to complain about it that said it may be a con for some people who are looking for something for their kids they sell a mini version of this here on amazon just look it up n the soup container can be reeeeeally hard to open it s easy to overtighten it so be careful n it s pretty heavy for a lunch container might be a little annoying for some people plus it s kind of tall so it might not fit well in a crowded office refrigerator if you opt for cool food and choose to put it in one n noverall it s great it s worked 100 perfectly for us and we really dig it 3
13;34;10;0.44301575334853227;the bentobox actually worked well as described but the carrying bag that came with it was severely worn out after literally two uses that s the main reason that i m not rating it 4 star

1;64;8;0.7376444165119761;i m so glad i bought this mat this is a replacement for another one i had purchased about nine months prior i bought a fabric one and realized quite soon after using it that they eventually go flat and i mean flat that mat is now in front of the back door in photo i wanted to buy one of these from a local store but they were really pricey 60 and up i just was n t ready to spend that much because i was not sure if i would like it n nso i decided on this mat i knew which color i wanted but then could not decide on the length i was not sure how a long one would look in my kitchen because of its size at this point i realize i could have used the long one but this mat is easy enough to move when you need to i stand in front of the sink for dishes and then i cut veggies on the left side of the sink so i do move it when i do the chopping n none thing i have noticed is that it does periodically move i mean only a fraction of an inch but you can look at it in two ways it is not completely stuck to the floor but then again it is not going to mark your floor either n na couple of criticisms i read in the other reviews was that people trip over it and that they had creases in the mat when delivered let s talk about the creases none my mat came completely flat in a large box i m not sure if possibly someone ordered the super long one but my 20 x32 came in perfect condition and it was the exact color that was in the picture as far as people tripping over it they must not be picking up their feet when they walk i have n t tripped over it yet even if you have a fabric mat you would trip over it if you do n t pick up your feet in fact with a fabric mat you run more of a risk of falling because you could catch your foot flip it up and then fall this mat will not flip up at all even if you drag your feet n nit works like a charm my back and feet feel great when i am standing for a while doing things at the sink and counter and the mat is holding up beautifully the other nice thing over a fabric mat is that any spills are easily wiped up so far all pros and no cons
2;11;17;0.7094017257849115;i just received this in the mail today and the quality of the material and its functionality in our kitchen are great so far the thickness and softness of the material feel wonderful under the feet n ni took off two stars though because the color mocha does not look like the mocha as advertised the color is a ruddier shade of brown and i would not have selected this color if i knew this beforehand these photos are untouched and actually what the mat looks like on our kitchen floor at this moment i took off a second star because the delivery of the mat was late and did not arrive on the day amazon prime it was supposed to arrive

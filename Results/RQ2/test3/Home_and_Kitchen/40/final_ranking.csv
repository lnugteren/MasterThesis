0;10;27;0.7695868915242817;i knew in my gut that if cooks illustrated endorsed these there had to be something wrong sorry guys but the emperor has no clothes virtually every ci recommendation i ve ever come across for a product with which i have personal experience has left me bug eyed and shaking my head incredulously imagine my relief and delight upon learning that others in a yahoo group to which i belong share my feelings n nthese cuisipro measuring spoons are no exception however at the price i paid for them i wanted to believe in spite of the fact that ci endorsements make me and my wallet hightail it to another product page stupid me n nmuch has been made by previous reviewers about the quality of these spoons and as it turns out they re quite right hence the two stars they re very heavy and are nicely finished as well but the fact of the matter is that unlike my cheap o plastic spoons four of these tablespoons do not measure cup in any of my measuring vessels only some of which are produced by the same manufacturer and all of which are equal to each other a level teaspoon of dry matter measured in the cuisipro spoons deviate from my other spoons by several grams when weighed a not insignificant amount to make matters worse they re not even accurate among themselves three teaspoonfuls do n t equal a tablespoon two teaspoonfuls do n t equal teaspoon and i think you get the idea by this time pathetic n nto add insult to injury they re fastened by not one but two rings wow these spoons seem to be undergoing an identity crisis and so are held together as though they re keys you not only have your basic ball key chain but your difficult to remove key ring as well say goodbye to your nails as you ponder why cuisipro could n t pony up with a pop open binder ring like the one on my wonderful amco measuring cups n ni m very very disappointed with these spoons i ve wanted some heavy stainless spoons that would fit a spice jar for a long time and at the last minute swayed by the reviews and the price i decided against the amco and went with these i wanted to make sure i got my 2 in before requesting a return label these are going back nflamers and fan boys on your mark
1;34;37;0.7112243200826882;for years i have used inexpensive plastic measuring spoons it was time to put them aside and find better quality spoons n nthe price and design of cuisipro measuring spoons were the selling points once i had started to use them i liked how they felt in the hand nice balance and weight i enjoy using the measuring spoons in the way that using a quality tool increases the enjoyment of the experience of cooking
2;15;10;0.689026883800234;this set is heavy duty as other reviewers have reported at the same time the metal is roughly finished in parts with uneven surfaces and some sharp edges i have n t tested the volumes but the spoons are n t perfectly symmetrical and so there s a good chance the measurements might be a tad off n ni decided to keep the set since i like the heft and it s good enough
3;19;18;0.6569323540413263;the spoons are solid and heavy the engraved quantities are clear and easy to read the polishing is sub par all the edges are uneven and lumpy a few of the spoons have ugly black pitting
4;1;8;0.5841412502993565;the spoons in the advert have nice smooth and polished edges the spoons we received the entire set have notably rough and pitted edges i suspect that the high ratings may have been deserved at one time but it looks there is a developing problem with quality control

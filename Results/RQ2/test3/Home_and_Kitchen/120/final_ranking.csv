0;8;98;0.9243938504578205;i purchased the wagner power steamer for one reason to clean grout i recently purchased a house built in 2003 the previous owners did not clean anything the kitchen is full tile with larger grout lines i thought the grout was brown but that was before i started using the wagner steamer on it the kitchen had several areas of the grout that was almost complete black the section behind the cooktop was completely covered in grease with a yellowish red hue we tried oven cleaner and it did n t make a dent in the grease n nso with that said i set the steamer up and used one of the black brush attachments on the small steam wand after 10 minutes or so i had a technique down that worked extremely well i would say i spent about three hours cleaning all of the grout lines on my kitchen tile including the back splashes that go to the bottom of the cabinets the grout went from looking brown black to light grey it literally looks like it s brand new the grease melted away like it was nothing it does take a bit of elbow grease but the steam does an incredible job of cleaning n nit also worked well in the shower to remove mildew and soap scum from the grout however my area has very hard water and it will not remove hard water stains so for some people i have a feeling that the grout gets dirty and then caked with hard water deposits the steamer can not get through this layer so it can not clean the grout i used a pummace stone in conjunction with the steamer and had much better results it also cleaned vinyl flooring and other items around the house well for the price i paid it more than paid for itself on the very first day my mom laughed at me and thought i had bought another tool that would n t get used she commented after i finished the kitchen of my new home that it was one of the coolest cleaning items she had seen in a very long time if you use it for it s intended purpose i think you will be more than pleased if you have hard water deposits do n t count on this to blast them away n ni also tried the flooring attachment and it works but at a slow pace you re better off with a standard cleaner and a scrub brush on a pole this tool is more about focused cleaning on a small area and it excelled for me in that role

3;81;42;0.9009717183457485;first i am very impressed with the quality of this steam cleaner from the moment i opened the box it was one of the most excellently packaged products and as i pulled each piece out each part was so solid well built i was really impressed by the construction of the unit the main unit itself seems so solid and tight the cap for the steam chamber fits so snugly and easily screwed and unscrewed with its brass threads it is clearly ready to build a lot of pressure where i expected some cheap parts such as with the hose and extensions they are clearly very heavy duty the extensions to turn into a floor mop were heafty when i expected cheap plastic i was impressed the hose was quite long too one funny thing not shown in the picture is that there is nowhere to coil the hose and it is much more than you see in the picture it helps you reach places easily but you will have to just coil the hose around the unit or something n nyou can fill it for up to 55 minutes of continuous steam but it claims it can run further depending on attachment it takes 5 15 minutes to heat up depending on how much water you put in i just turn it on and do something else and come back and it is ready then it can run steam continuously at least until you want to move it to another location further from the plug with the long hose you can reach a lot of places but due to the power needs the power cord will not let you use it all over your house without unplugging and moving it however you can easily do just that unplug move it plug back in and it maintains nearly all of its heat and steam in the move and is ready nearly instantly n nit does hold onto heat and steam for a while so when you are done you turn off unplug and have to empty the steam into a sink and wait at least 15 minutes before opening the cap because even the cap itself will be extremely hot so to refill if you need more you will have to wait so fill with enough to do your cleaning and consider taking a break if you need more to cool down refill and heat back up you also have to empty the unit after use this is primarily because it gives you dire warnings not to overfill and you would n t know how much water was in it already the measuring cup to fill is well marked gives you the run time and fill lines and is easy to fill the unit without spilling emptying the unit requires you to lift and turn upside down over a sink which is slightly awkward but not troublesome there is no separate drain probably due to the precision needed to limit holes to maintain steam in the chamber you can run the unit dry and it is designed to overhead and automatically shut off and is supposed to reset automatically after cooling but you know when you out of steam and can just stop on your own i ve run it dry but did n t wait for it to shut itself down n nas for cleaning it definitely helped me clean some things easily but still does n t perform miracles it easily got some spots off the lenolium floor that my swiffer and other shark steam mop could n t pick up and got some rust off a glass shower door it could completely clean test sections of my very marked up dirty kitchen lenolium with some scrubbing for a while but it probably took off the finish too so i am still just testing that it took a lot of elbow work out of removing grime from kitchen tile backsplash it did n t work instantly but with some reasonable motion of the attachment brush on the tile while taking turns to wipe away and rub with a dry towel it cleaned 100 times faster than soap and water that i tried on the same area a week before i also steamed some really dirty horizontal blinds and worked wonders on them with about 20 minutes of cleaning i had to use the nosel directly against it and it melted off much of the grime but i think the blinds were already permanently marked up by age anyway so there are still some spots but it did wonders on the blinds if done carefully i steamed directly against them a few rows at a time while wiping with a towel be very careful not to burn yourself by accidentally wiping while you are still steaming i used the scrubber on tough sections they are not new again but a ton better n nso i am happy with the unit it is excellently constructed and makes some jobs a lot easier physically i did n t try the floor attachment yet i am happy with my shark steam mop for normal mopping between swiffering the shark heats in 30 seconds and is better suited for routine cleaning i think this is my unit for hard core twice a year cleaning n nupdate i tried the floor attachment it works but does n t seem as easy as and does n t clean any better than my nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href shark deluxe steam pocket mop s3501 dp b0028mb3hm ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 shark deluxe steam pocket mop s3501 a for floors i much prefer just picking up my shark deluxe steam mop which does an equal or better job on floors but feels faster easier with this you wrap a pad or towel they give you around a brissle based brush with some strong clamps to hold the towel on it seems a lot more rigid because it wraps around some really hard brissles and did not work miricles but did pick up stuff i did go back with the nossle attachment and tried to scrub my whole floor which is an impossible job and really damages the lenolium they tell you not to scrub hard on non tile anwyay so i am still happy with my purchase i will just use it for certain cleaning tasks that it is a lot better at than floors

5;75;23;0.8880346056626479;i bought this a few months ago and i love using it the first project was cleaning the grout on my tile floor it still took some scrubbing and ammonia but flushing it out with the steam cleaner made the grout super clean i clean my tile and hardwood floors every week with it and it does a much better job than a mop we never use the mop anymore you can see the dirt come off onto the cloth it gives off more than enough steam for my projects it is easy to use and compact to store i really like using it and am becoming a cleaning freak with it however i tried it on my grill but found that it took too long using a garden hose cleaning solution and a large grill brush was much faster n nsome design cons 1 the swiveling wheel on the unit is at the back instead of the front so it bangs into furniture and walls when i pull it along by the hose it is most annoying to me 2 there is no way to wind up the cord so i have to use a rubber band the cord could be another 6 ft longer 3 the towel it comes with is hardly adequate you ll have to buy more or improvise with rags 4 i wish it also came with a medium size brush head 5 after 3 months the o rings to the handle broke and fell off allowing steam to escape between the handle and any attachment you attach to it i called customer service right away and the rep arranged to send me a couple of replacement rings no questions asked when i returned to the unit i discovered the leaking steam must have melted the attachment release button on the handle and it just fell out i called customer service again and another rep arranged to send me an entire replacement handle again with no questions asked i was very impressed with the easy service but i also wondered if broken o rings with subsequent damage to the handle were a common problem and that is why there was no questions asked about how old the unit was nonetheless once i get the replacement parts i m excited about going back to cleaning with it n nupdate the replacement parts came within a couple of days it is working fine but after 4 months of use i noticed the extension tubes flexing more when i need to scrub my floor more firmly sometimes i worry about them breaking at the joints so i have ease off the pressure they should be more sturdy

7;2;97;0.8790748541781174;first let me say i am an agonizer analyzer i read all of the reviews out there on amazon and the web that i can find i was down to this the shark vs wagner steamers both seemed similar in reviews i saved 5 bucks by purchasing the wagner i received it 1 day earlier then expected i opened the box and dug in yes i am also a person that does n t necessarily read the instructions until i ca n t get something to work that is guess what everything worked without reading the instructions note to the wise it is probably best if you do i have since gone back to ensure i was operating the machine safely and correctly n ni love it when people say in their reviews that they could n t stop cleaning stuff it is soooooo true these are the things i have cleaned so far 3 kitchen sinks i could n t believe how clean they became they are all stainless and shining like mad i really do believe they are clean enough to eat out of them not that i would i have granite counters with this itty bitty grout between the sinks and the counters i did n t realize they used white grout oh my gosh they look like they were just put in and they are 11 years old n nwhat else yes i did n t stop there i went over to the stove it is stainless steel with gas fixtures and iron grates do you know how many cleaners i have purchased for the black metal top that have never made it look like it was really totally clean many many many this machine did it and i honestly have to say i did n t put any real elbow grease in at all it lifted stains that i thought were permanent it also removed a burn mark in the stainless steel which had been there for at least 3 years with a lot of scrubbing that did n t take it away and after using the machine it was really only a matter of wiping a little water residue away n ni really like the length of the handle hose i left it on top of one counter and was able to walk around the kitchen without worrying if the yellow beauty was going to fall off the counter or not reach where i wanted to take it got ta love it n nok the above were only a few things that i cleaned in the first 15 minutes of opening the box i probably could have cleaned more but i figured i would save my joy for another day n na few other comments i read a review that it was loud to operate the machine itself does n t make any noise it is n t like a motor is going while you are trying to clean the only noise that is made is the high pressure steam coming out of the nozzle what do these people really expect hello it was music to my ears because of the clean up it was doing i can imagine that you would n t want to be locked in a small closed in space for long but hey it did n t take that long to see it sparkle n nthis truly is a great investment fun to use with fantastic results n nyahoo
8;4;92;0.8762368433568862;i originally came here to amazon to buy a steam mop after seeing a popular informercial i do n t trust infomercials so i came here to read reviews about the product i eventually discovered that instead of a steam mop for just my floors i could get a full steam machine that will do the entire house n ni am so glad i did not get just a steam mop i would have missed out on the true power of steam five minutes after opening the box i had assembled the machine and was filling the tank with water the steamer heated up quickly and i began steaming i was excited to see what it could do and it did n t dissappointed n nthere are 2 things in my house that i absolutely hate cleaning they are the glass enclosed shower stall and the jacuzzi tub so i started steaming there n ni have a 3 sided 8ft high glass enclosed shower stall that i dread cleaning it is dreamy to look at but a nightmare to clean using glass cleaners was a tedious chore it would take over an hour to clean all that glass and it still left streaks in the glass n nthe wagner cleaner did the same job in less than 10 minutes using the squeegee attachment and no streaks my glass stall was perfectly clean and beautiful using just steam i am excited because now i can clean the glass shower more often instead of avoiding it like i have been doing n ni then went to clean my jacuzzi tub this is what prompted me to write this testimonial i have n t used my jacuzzi in 3 years because of how difficult it was to clean the jet nozzles after using the tub the jet nozzles in the tub became clogged with soap scum and dead skin after only a few uses and the only way to clean inside those small jet nozzles was with a swab stick talk about tedious n ni was so exicted to see the wagner steamer power through that grime in seconds and leave the jet nozzles looking brand spanking new n nthis alone was worth the purchase of this product for me i have n t used it on my floors yet but at first glance the floor attachment is a bit small for me i have a lot of square footage to cover so i wish it was bigger and i wish there were replacement towels but all in all just based on the way it cleaned the glass shower and the jacuzzi jet nozzles this is a priceles warrior in the battle of the grime i do n t know how i got along without a power steamer all these years n n update nday 2 of cleaning i discovered my cat has being using my new sofa as a urinal i decided to try the steamer on the urine stains i was not sure what to expect but i was amazed and suprised at the result the urine smell dissapeared without the use of any chemicals leaving behind a near perfectly fresh scent the fabric was black so i can not comment on whether or not any visual stain was obliterated but this result with pet urine was exciting enough for me to amend my review
9;97;58;0.8317850363571013;i ve had this machine a couple of months now and i really love it my favorite uses for it so far are cleaning the bathroom and my tile floor i take everything out of my bathroom soap dispensers on the counters shampoo in the shower etc and then i just blast steam on everything the bottom of my shower floor never looked so clean it does take some extra scrubbing the first time because you do n t realize how much soap scum is built up until you actually get on your hands and knees and really look the steamer helps to get all the stuff loose and then you can get a scrubber sponge and get the rest out same with the counter tops bathtub and comode my bathrooms have linoleum and they were just gross i hate linoleum did a great job getting those clean although the heat took off the wax finish but i do n t care i can mop that back on it did an awesome job on my tile floor i have about 1000 square feet of tile in my house my tile has groves in it and dirt gets trapped in side it takes time to steam each one the first time but i was able to get all the dirt out of the grooves and now i just use the floor feature everytime i want to clean the floor have n t mopped or used chemicals on the floor or in the bathroom since i got this little beauty ca n t wait to try it on other things
10;23;8;0.8286478147554144;i purchased this item on it s good reviews and probably should have taken a closer look at the negative reviews the day it showed up i was totally excited to see if it was as wonderful as most people have said about steam cleaners i was less then thrilled at the results i started looking online for an answer did i expect too much was i using it incorrectly n nin the end i had amazon ship another one i m glad i did thank you amazon s customer service for being quick and courteous now that i know how to navigate through customer service i really am confident about my future purchases so i opened the second one and sure enough there was a huge difference in the performance of the product n nthings i noticed about the first unit that made me question it s performance was the water condensation in the power switch it still happened in the second unit but not as bad secondly my first unit made steam but it did n t seem hot enough there was a noticeable difference with the second unit if the tool is touching a surface and creating steam the surface should be somewhat hot to the touch afterwards thirdly the light kept going on and off way too often and i was getting way too much water although you usually get water even with my working unit i just make sure i get the steam going over a sink first a general gripe i have n t heard from anyone else is that both units smelled like burning plastic when i first used it it still smells that way i m assuming it s whatever voc s the product has i hope the smell starts to go away with repeated use of the system n nmy biggest test was to get some puke out of my minivan it definitely helped the situation my concerns with down the road echos many others where i can see running into a problem with the hose in the future and having no way to replace it i also wish there was a way to keep some of the attachments on the unit although i understand the design is to make it small and compact trying to keep track of the squeegee the steam brush the little nozzle pieces might be difficult with my children around if not a way to keep the attachments on the unit then possibly a way to retract the power cord or some sort of good method for coiling the hose around the unit
11;29;22;0.8267805809106619;i bought this steamer over a year ago and have used it several times my favorite use for it is to clean the window sills and base boards the kitchen and the tile grout i have white grout dumbest idea ever and the steamer cleans it really well though i still have to get down on my hands and knees and wipe with a bit of vigor it still sure beats the toothbrush and bleach method i read many of the bad reviews on this machine and without trying to be snide i have some simple answers to people s woes always use distilled water in the machine any hard water minerals will eventually cause damage to the inside mechanism never pour more water into the machine when you first run out of steam the inside chamber acts like a pressure cooker and is extremely hot therefore if you pour water that is cold or even tepid you are risking serious damage to the chamber not to mention yourself before you open the water gasket after use always make sure to turn the machine off and keep the steam nozzle locked to the on position this allows any steam that might be trapped inside to escape through the nozzle and not through the gasket which could potentially cause a burn if you simply can not wait for the machine to naturally cool down before adding more water you must microwave the water you will be adding until almost boiling this will not only avoid possible damage but will also speed up the heating process so when you are in the middle of a project you decrease wait time until steamer is ready remember that this steamer is here to help decrease the need for chemical cleaners and does a fine job in very little time i am very satisfied with my choice and recommend to others looking for a good priced machine the only true negative for me is the cord it does not have a place so i just have to wrap it around the steamer when i put it away slightly annoying
12;40;60;0.8120087875642692;i write reviews for the same reasons i read them to point out things that a potential buyer should consider before purchase n nthis steamer could be a 5 star product but it has a few deficiencies that take away from its usefulness n ncapacity as with any steamer you have to fill it and then wait until it heats up before using this unit has a 16oz capacity which is good for about 10 minutes of use once empty you have to wait fro the unit to cool down and then repeat the process so those 10 minutes of steam take about 30 minutes n n correction 9 2009 ni ve been informed that the capacity is 48oz 3x16oz cups i ll stick with my 3 star rating though 3 times more water would me much longer heatup time n end n nease of use you should n t leave water in the unit when not in use also you should n t add more than the max capacity 16oz so you should start with an empty tank so you know how much water goes in the filler hole is behind a door at the top of the unit and they provide a small funnel to help fill it but to empty it out you have to turn the whole steamer upside down no an easy task add to that the fact that the steam hose and electric cord are fixed so you have to lug the whole mess around with you that s about 8 10 feet of hose and 12 or so feet of cord they do n t have any way to coil either or help make it easier n neffectiveness i use mine to clean bird cages and if you hit a pile of dried bird poop with a pressurized stream of 200 degree steam it just melts away so hit it with the steam and wipe it off and you re done but the main reason to do it with a steamer is it disinfects whatever you steam same reason you cook meat to over 160 degrees n ni have n t used it on wall paper but i would suspect that it would be quite time consuming even the box claims that it is 20 faster with the steamer so an hour of scraping would take 48 minutes of steaming add in the refilling cooling waiting to heat up times and you d probably spend twice as much time using this steamer as elbow grease n nso if you re a parrot owner this is much better than those seen on tv units and in my opinion worth the extra cost it is also much easier and more effective than scrubbing so you ll be more prone to clean your cages thoroughly n ni am happy with this purchase
13;54;20;0.6880493444116452;i bought this unit because i have close to 2000 sf of ceramic tile and a recalcitrant little dog best feature for me is the ability to clip a microfiber cloth on the scrubby head i use to steam clean the floors i also like the small jet head type attachment for cleaning the shower door tracks and icky corners

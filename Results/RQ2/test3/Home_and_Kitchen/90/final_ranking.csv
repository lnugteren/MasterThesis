0;2;87;0.83651338667333;i love this waffle maker it s like the ones our mom used not those cheesy seeming plastic things they re making now it s also got a lot of excellent features that make my life easier ni ll mention right now that this is a very hot waffle maker they make the plastic ones to be cool touch i ll trade the cool touch feature for the sturdier design of this versatile machine i m being careful and have n t burned myself yet but it s something to consider if you d like your children making waffles my ten year old could be careful enough but i keep my five and eight year olds away nthe waffles this machine makes are great they freeze well too the family is very happy when the light goes of the unit is ready to make waffles pour in the batter and the light comes on again wait for it to go off and the waffle is done however i usually go on instinct and sometimes pull out the waffle before the light goes off nthe open grill feature makes wonderful pancakes and fried eggs i have a big family and it s nice to have two pancakes cook at a shot without taking up all my stovetop i can have bacon and eggs on the stove and the pancakes on the waffle maker i can also have a heart attack if i keep eating all these bacon and eggs nthe sandwich feature is nice i can cook two grilled cheese sandwiches at one time getting me out of the kitchen quicker some advice cheese might drip out the side of the sandwich just keep the sandwich away from the back of the unit where the cables run in and the mess just wipes off no problem the sandwiches cook far more uniformly than they do in a pan on the stove they taste great nthis unit cleans up easily and changing the grills from waffle to flat is easy i recommend it over a lot of more costly models if you want more value for your money this is the most versatile waffle maker i ve found and all the features actually work
1;67;55;0.8239026302689256;it gets four stars only because the exterior gets so hot else it s a five star product i requested it as a christmas gift after cooks illustrated gave it a top recommendation n nthe nonstick has been as advertised non sticky i use plain vegetable shortening crisco at the beginning of a waffle session and i m set i wonder if those who have had problems were using an aerosol spray like pam which are known to cause stickiness on non stick surfaces n nit heats up fast enough and cooks the waffles evenly n ni ve not used the griddle side but i would anticipate the same issues when flipping the iron griddle that i always had with my parents west bend the first few items after a flip are more likely to stick thus more shortening was needed i let the shortening bake in for a few minutes to sort of season the grids and the iron was good to go n nas for the customer who wanted an audio signal when the waffle was done sounds good but i ve never seen a model with that feature and what is the sensor is it a timer or a temperature sensor i open the iron when the waffle has stopped steaming and it s done when using different types of batter yeasted vs chemically raised pumpkin vs plain etc it can take longer oatmeal waffles in particular are very slow to cook
2;53;19;0.821227894526472;all my life my parents had a square metal waffle iron it had reversible plates that turned into a griddle and could be submerged into water for easy cleaning the pattern on the waffle side was small and made little crisp wells for syrup not fat wells like a belgian waffle that get soggy i like lots of butter and syrup and need a waffle that holds up then i went to college i searched for 4 years to find a waffle maker like theirs and finally did i ve read some other reviews and thought i give my opinions and responses to others n n proper use for great waffles n1 i understand that it has non stick plates but it is essential to use cooking spray with this iron i ve seen several bad reviews because the cook did n t use cooking spray i always use spray and have great results n2 there is a customer picture of a waffle from an iron that did n t heat evenly to address this the iron has a waffle setting i use the hotter end of that setting that being said you must wait around 5 minutes for these heavy duty plates to properly heat then get a little water on your finger and sprinkle a few drops on the plates they should sizzle and bubble rapidly you are ready to cook n3 another photo showed the waffle stuck to the top of the iron once again use cooking spray also do not try to lift the lid until the maker has stopped steaming this will keep the waffle from pulling apart also adding an egg to the waffle batter helps it cook n n proper care for a long lasting waffle maker n1 when finished making waffles wait until the plates have cooled to clean them use very hot soapy water and submerge the plates wash with a non abrasive wash cloth and rinse with hot water then take a towel and thoroughly dry both sides of the plates including between every groove wipe the cooled waffle iron down and replace the plates n2 do n t use metal on the plates please i use a fork and pick the waffle up from the side i never let the fork touch the plates n3 on the front of the maker are small metal clips that hold the plates in place be gentle and do n t abuse these n ni love my waffle iron my parents still have their older model from circa 1970 and i hope to have mine as long i have never had any problems out of mine please use with caution as all parts of this iron a very hot and remain so for a considerable amount of time after use n nhope you enjoy yours as much as i do
3;10;34;0.8061817376153394;i ve just looked over the other one star reviews to see if maybe there is a some trick to what i ve started experiencing but alas it seems like i m part of a trend i bought this griddle waffle maker because after about 8 years my previous waffle maker shorted out it made great waffles every time this product had the promise of doing that as well as being an all around griddle king it looks very similar to one i grew up watching my dad use n nwell this product ai n t one of those do n t fry eggs on this thing because you ll end up with scraped up egg roadkill it makes good grilled cheese sandwiches and hash browns though but n nthe waffles yes i love waffles a lot in fact this thing worked great about three times the time was right and the waffles came right out but all of a sudden something changed and instead i get a sad view of the interior mid section of my waffles like some breakfast autopsy scene i have to thing take the metal grill plates out and soak them because the waffle batter is heat applied to both grill halves it seems almost no amount of oil pam will work now i suspect some horrible chemical film is sprayed on the metal along with whatever excuse for non stick coating and it wore off on the food so its now a metal piece of junk n nwhy is it so hard to find a decent waffle maker these days
4;7;60;0.8058956689007326;this is a great waffle maker every time we make waffles they flip right out just like they re supposed to we have n t had any of them get stuck or had any of the disasters frustrations that we ve had with other waffle irons it s actually easy to make a waffle again can you imagine i think the reason why is that the teflon is good and it gets hot evenly n nafter you get it my recommendation would be to follow the directions that comes with it just before preheating brush on some vegetable oil like it says to do i guess you can use spray but we ve found the oil at first works best after that you wo n t need anything at all for the other batches also be sure not to mess up the teflon coating by washing it while it s still hot let it cool off completely or by using utensils that will scratch it up like metal forks and scrubbers if you take care of this sensitive teflon it will take care of you i think it says not to put it in the dishwasher so you probably do n t want to both plates top and bottom are completely removable and they re really easy to clean with a basic sponge do n t use the scrubby side of the sponge though you wo n t need to anyway n nwe ve made waffles several times already and they ve been perfect every time it does get really hot but that s a good thing we ve also flipped it over to the grill side and that s great too we ve made quesadillas grilled cheese sandwiches and burgers for burgers it has a trench like thing around the border of the grill that the fat collects in you ll need a little cup or something to catch it where it supposed to drip out n nif you really want it to drain the fat away fast like a forman type grill just put something under the back left leg to tilt it a bit do n t put something under the leg that could catch fire though again say it with me it gets really hot we ve been placing it on our stove top when we use it if you have sensitive counter tops do that too n nif you make a sandwich keep the grill open and flip the sandwich as needed otherwise your sandwich will get really flat i think that s it it really is one of our better purchases lately and so we take good care of it oh and adding a nice amount of vanilla extract to your waffle batter makes them delicious wife said to throw that in happy waffle n
5;39;17;0.7976988764842594;we ve used our new waffle maker a few times now and it s great before choosing it i did read all the reviews and took them into consideration but bottom line this was exactly what i wanted had one just like it years ago we oiled the waffle plates before using it the first time and have never had a problem with sticking the waffles come out perfect they are not thick waffles like the belgium ones these are just old fashioned waffles much easier to make breakfast since this makes a larger 4 square then the belgium waffle makers the only thing i can see that many reviewers pointed out is that the two clips that hold the front of the griddles in place are not the best looking at the picture on the box i could clearly see that these clips just were n t finished they were n t bent the way they should be so i took care of that with a pair of needle nose pliers now they are tight like they should be so the quality of things these days is not the best my old one most likely was made in the usa must sturdier but all in all this works well and hopefully will last for a few years there are n t very many that have the removable plates which make it easy to wash
6;76;26;0.7967336758917745;for years i struggled with a low end plastic waffle iron wanting an upgrade one of my cooking magazines recommended black and decker s as being a good quality on that i ordered this item i have to say initially it was a good unit although somewhat flimsy i liked that you could flip the griddle plates for waffles or pancakes it gets very hot and made nice crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside waffles the first time out i was so happy at first but now after nearly a year of occasional use the iron sticks so bad nothing can be pried from its surface the so called no stick coating is worthless pancakes must be scraped from the griddle and waffles just forget it they have become one with the the iron until submerged in hot water for a few hours i give up on this iron now i m looking for another better one and do n t think i did some crazy thing to damage the surface either nope just washed it with dish soap and hot water after each use ca n t for the life of me figure out why its sticks so badly now such a shame too
7;49;16;0.7746428562719965;i was so excited to find this item that i loved making grilled cheese sandwiches and waffles on when i was a kid i have a small kitchen now so having one gadget that performs multiple functions was also a plus my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when i received it and noticed how lightweight an cheaply made it seemed to be understanding that materials have changed in the past 35 years and heavier does n t always mean better i decided to keep it and give it a try unfortunately one of the hinges was not assembled properly and the top would not stay upright i contacted amazon and requested a replacement which was very easy and hassle free when the replacement arrived i checked the hinges which seemed fine the grill plates were loose and did n t fit perfectly but what the heck my mouth was watering for the grilled cheese sandwich from my childhood it worked good enough and i decided to keep it well since then i have made two more grilled cheese sandwiches and had two mornings of waffles and looks like that is all i get the top plate of the grill will not stay attached to the cover it does however stay attached to the waffles when the top is lifted it seems to be an issue with the clip that is supposed to keep it in place i tried adjusting the clip a bit to no avail it is past the return deadline so 60 bucks down the drain i guess at least i still have my childhood memories i strongly suggest you do not buy this product
8;50;13;0.7451396864278315;after owning this waffle maker for over 1 year i ve finally had enough and am throwing it out it s big it s bulky it s heavy and takes forever to heat up if using as waffle maker it takes 7 8 minutes to heat up if using as griddle try infinity that part you can plan ahead for as long as you know it i suppose you can make your batter while this piece of junk pre heats n ni ve burned myself and had to scrape bits of waffles off this thing more often than i can count and yes i did read and follow all of the instructions i am german after all the metal outside coating has no insulation whatsoever so it gets crazy hot really bad idea if you have kids i ve even burned my fingers on the black parts where you lift the top on the medium waffle setting n ndifferent waffle recipes are hit or miss i always make sure i use adequate oil in my batter but i ve found that some recipes stick you end up with almost burnt outside waffles that are stuck to the plates while the inside is n t cooked on the medium setting mind you using recipes from magazines that have clearly been tested n nhaving removable plates comes in handy when you have that kind off mess on your hands ever scraped bits of half burnt half cooked waffles off one of these with a wooden chopstick not fun unfortunately the removable plates have a tendency to come off the top part even when they re clipped in properly just because they are freakin heavy and the clip is weak then you end up trying to lift that heavy ass plate off your waffle trying not to burn yourself n nthis thing is just poorly thought out and not safe to use i will buy a german brand next time
9;19;6;0.6926714117206653;hi n nhad a little trouble at first i had the grills for the waffle maker placed in the wrong slots so they were n t releasing probably i later found out that it was the recipe that i use to make this non dairy healthy waffles that make it stick rising of a normal waffle mix helps for easy release even with that recipe for healthy waffles being a little stressful this works like a complete dream i loved it so much i made a month supply of waffles haha n this waffle maker is a major improvement from what i first started with this waffle maker makes it enjoyable to make waffles now when you get it in your home you re going to notice that it is really thin and it s going to feel cheaply made because of that but it is not tt will tell you do not touch the top of the waffle maker when in use and you do not do that the coil is right there they could have supplied it with a thicker housing to compensate for the heat it gives off the grills are really easy to clean you re going to want to pay attention to the placement of the grills because i have noticed that it matters if not they are going to fall out of the slots
10;47;10;0.6380485815132799;i really like this waffle maker we have three in the office we bought a forth because there was no overfill catch on one two were single mini waffles i looked through all the amazon reviews on popular highly rated waffle makers via 3rd party sites i was struck with hesitation after seeing most amazon reviews for these items the last couple of months are all one star n nwe just bought a second one of these it makes great waffles the removable inserts are secure we did n t have any problems with the latch because we carefully put them on and take them off we pull the metal latch back a bit and then release it we had no problem with heat we rubbed oil on initially with a paper towel one more thing that was great is the waffle maker is hot but it has several handles that are not out of our previous three only one had a handle that did n t get extremely hot after 3 or more batches n ni hope this is helpful for anyone like me that was confused by all the one star reviews i gave it four out of five for price easy of use great waffles but it is on the slow side we make 10 20 batches so we just bought a second one to speed things up
11;31;7;0.6117690845738534;hate this waffle maker this black and decker 3 1 waffle maker looks like the wonderfully efficient toastmaster 3 1 griddle i owned years ago the plates on this griddle do not stay locked in place and dangerously keep falling out when attempting to close not good when they re hot i tried pressing the mechanism tighter to no avail the waffles do n t even taste good because the griddles down compress enough and the waffles are n t crispy i m stuck with this poor quality inefficient waffle iron do not recommend this brand or refurbished appliances from seller i own a small cuisinart waffle iron and a krups which are excellent but always liked a 3 1 black decker misses the mark the refurbished appliance is a waste of money

0;6;33;0.8567417229959517;i purchased the briel chamonix as a step up replacement for my krups steamer after brewing a couple of shots i realized the flavor i was missing while i was using my trusty krups i feel i ve made a reasonable purchase with this machine with these positive observations n this is a great value for the money i spent n consistently positive reviews on amazon 4 5 stars 56 reviews n nice compact form n the machine heats up very quickly n contrary to a couple of other reviewers experience the espresso produced is very hot with no need to re heat the coffee n excellent steam for frothing nthese were are some draw backs n the distance under the brew head to the base of the machine is indeed short a shot glass fits comfortably but nothing any taller i need to find a short container that holds two shots because n when making two shots the dispensor does not fill two individual shot glasses evenly the right glass always fills up before the left i like double shot lattes so i find this an inconvenience n the frothing wand is at a rather odd angle nneutral thoughts and experiences n the package arrived with excessive moisture on and around the machine packaged inside a plastic bag just as this web site and other reviews have noted no surpise here n as several reviewers experienced the stainless steel front panel had come apart from the machine and was laying loose in the box i attribute this to the aforementioned excessive moisture in the package and probable tempurature swings the package was subjected to before arrival at my doorstep i carefully cleaned the machine surface and removed the water droplets from the steel panel used a blow dryer and afixed it back to the machine seems to be holding fine n following the enclosed instructions it took three attempts to prime the pump n having previous experience with espresso makers proved to be valuable in working with this machine i think a beginner might not find the instructions very intuitive
1;9;15;0.8505757658481963;i ve read most of the reviews on the product and am consolidating the views here n1 the machine is made of a fairly sturdy plastic it does look metallic on the picture n2 the space under the brewhead is small you need to brew directly into either shot cups or espresso cups these are not included n3 it is not hard to clean the drip tray is removable from the main unit you can unscrew the nozzle on the capuccino jet the filter holder has filter retainer so you can bang out the grinds and not lose the basket grinds due tend to stick to the brew head but if you run hot water through the machine it will clean the brew head n4 the baskets are somewhat small you can barely fit two tablespoons in the big filter basket n5 it is a little hard to use the milk frother because n a the tip is about six inches from the ground n b the length of the frother is about four inches so if you have a large frothing pitcher you need to tilt the frothing pitcher to steam the milk n c b c of the set up it is also hard to move the frother in a circular direction there s not a lot of space n d you should not brew espresso simultaneously with frothing milk n e you should remove the filter basket when frothing milk n f you have to wait about 1 minute after brewing espresso before you can froth the milk n g you should also turn on the frother before you froth the milk this will eliminate any built in water generally the first 5 seconds on my machine is water i put a towel under the frother and then i have a hot towel to clean my machine with then i turn off the frother place the pitcher underneath and then froth the milk n5 i am guessing b c of the price point that many people buying this machine are new to brewing espresso i was therefore n a you are brewing a small amount of liquid into a relatively large ceramic cup therefore if your equipment filter cup etc are not warm the heat from the espresso will warm up the equipment consequently the espresso will cool down this is n t such a big problem with brewed coffee b c the ratio of coffee to the size of the cup is so much greater n b you need to pre warm your equipment this is true of any machine this is easy place the empty filter in the machine and brew water into the espresso cup let stand to warm up the ceramic this also cleans the filter head of any excess coffee then discard water and brew espresso your espresso should stay warmer b c it is losing less energy warming up the cup n c i have measured the water temperature in the ceramic cup at 170 f espresso should brew between 190 206 f this could be b c the machine runs a little cold or heat loss in the grinds or in the ceramic a better test is to stick a thermometer into a styroform cup and measure the water temp that way i will report back when i have done that n6 you need to experiment with the grind while grinding at home is generally better i am guessing that if you are buying the chamonix you are not willing to spend a lot of money on a decent grinder blade grinders the kind of grinder you can buy for a jackson are n t going to cut it the inexpensive burr ginders the kind you can buy for half a benjamin have horrible reviews on amazon so get a weeks worth ground at the store n7 still i feel the water runs through the grinds too fast i think the goal is one oz of espresso should take 22 seconds n8 the automatic water system pushes too much water through more like 12 oz at the highest setting rather than 8 oz but you can adjust the water level and you can manually stop the water flow n9 yes it drips a little bit n10 i have not dealt with the customer service department nbrewing espresso well is a bit of an art for a low end machine and at this price that is what this is you get a decent shot
2;1;8;0.8430400948663387;i ve had this machine for about 3 5 years now and i ve got ta say i m still very happy with it i do n t normally write reviews on things i buy but today as i enjoyed my billionth espresso i thought this little machine deserves some positive reinforcement n na few things to note i worked in a coffee shop in my undergrad college town so i had prior knowledge about espresso what s good bad volume time needed to make good espresso etc i am kind of picky about messes i hate them n nthe good things nfirst this machine has easy to use buttons on the front that are self explanitory it s easy to use functions are definitely a plus n nsecond i like the tamper feature on the right side not many people mention this but that s just one less gadget i have to worry about if i m using espresso as opposed to the e s e pods n nthird it s setable volume control is great i love how i do n t have to turn it on and off manually i can start it and then walk around the kitchen getting my other breakfast items in line then come back to my perfect espresso n nfourth great crema i do not know if this is due to the coffee i buy or the machine but i think it s great n nfifth two sizes of cages for the coffee not sure if cages is the right word but i m referring to the fact that i can make single or double shot espresso with just 1 mess assuming i m not using e s e n nsixth the e s e compatibility sure other machines offer the same compatibility i will tell you potential buyers that these little mess free pods are a life saver for that hint of ocd in us all n nseventh easy to clean parts the water reservoir comes out the tray beneath the espresso spout comes out and it s so easy to clean everything just throw in the dishwasher n neighth the price is unbeatable for the product fantastic value for the price i was thinking about 2 years was all i d get out of it since i drink a minimum of 2 shots of espresso a day still going strong and when this guy dies i ll get another one n nnow i should mention there are some bad things n1 due to the compact design the water reservoir goes empty within a week or so this can be seen as a pro or a con on one hand old water can get nasty but on the other i do n t like messing with filling it up even though there s a hole in the top that i just pour water into n n2 on my model the steam wand was n t flexible it looks like they ve updated it n n3 i m worried about some potential leaking around the o ring this happens if i m not overbearingly strong when attaching the espresso basket when i use coffee as opposed to those awesome e s e pods n n4 i do n t like the post espresso leak but i have figured what you do is just put your espresso cup up to the drops and draw them out this stops dripping n n5 noise i know i had to bring it up though espresso machines are noisy but i had to present this side of things n n6 delay from steaming to espresso if you steam milk for a latte you should probably know there may be a slight delay if you steam your milk before you pump your espresso this is probably because the steam is somehow designated for the steaming and then if you try to pump espresso it has to re route or something i do n t know i m not an espresso machine engineer however it s a little annoying solution is to pump espresso prior to steaming or plan on a slight delay n nespresso pods what am i talking about ni m talking about e s e pods you can buy them online probably on amazon for around 40 50 for 150 single shot servings they re packaged individually and they re so clean if you compost they are compostable n noverall there s a lot to be said about this machine no real reason to listen to me besides i am a tightwad and only buy things that are a good value also i like things to be efficient and easy to clean and this machine covers that as well furthermore i like things to do what they re supposed to do and this machine does just that perfect espresso perfect froth and a great value n nonly one word of advice have some control after you have your own espresso machine you might be bouncing off the walls due to the fact that you have your own espresso machine pace yourself n ngood luck with your decision n n update july 2007 n ni mentioned earlier that i was worried about the o ring of the machine after a couple of years using it you know you need to replace it when the espresso comes out of another area of the portafilter instead of the intended spouts like around the edges etc this will happen with any machine eventually n nfinally i had to replace it which only cost 15 it s called the group gasket and that price includes shipping here s what you have to do n nlook at the back of the machine and call the phone number when they answer just tell them you need a new group gasket for your machine this is a very large rubber piece that covers more than what you d think is necessary for the machine but as i mentioned before i m not an engineer so i just accept what it is n nthe service dept is terrible as far as their bedside manner but i will say they know what they re talking about the guy who you ll probably talk to barely speaks english and kind of yells into the phone he will probably say you need to take apart the machine are you sure it is the group gasket etc but knows his stuff n nthen once you get it you ll have to flip the machine over and unscrew the basket there ll be an upside down bell shaped thing that is covered with the group gasket and you ll have to remove it with a needle nosed pliers do n t worry about ruining this piece it s garbage n nthen here comes the hard part you have to squeeze the new group gasket onto the upside down bell thing and the surrounding surfaces this is pretty hard but just inch it down no matter what remember the repair guy sent the right size it seems like it s too big but do n t worry n nonce you get it on put in the empty portafilter and run a few shots and do some practice runs it will settle into place after you unscrew and screw in the portafilter the group gasket creates a seal that the portafilter comes flush with so they need to get acquainted n nso there you have it i was pretty annoyed with how hard it is to find the part but i ve done the hard work for you so after 4 5 years of hard use just plan on spending 15 to replace it n nthe key is no need to buy a new machine i almost got a new one but figured i d give this a shot and it s all set i m hoping for another 4 5 years and more awesome espresso n ngood luck
3;10;11;0.8275170636669955;i bought this machine used after searching high and low for a machine that was the closest thing to a high end espresso machine without the high end price there really are few other machines with 12 bars of pressure for under 200 that get solid reviews i paid 75 used i m writing this review because after reading a hundred of them and then trying the chamonix i m convinced that most of the negative reviews are the result of impatience or unwillingness to experiment the first day i tried it i was ready to return it espresso barely flowed it was weak and the machine was a little messy to be sure but after a few days it s great here are some noteworthy things n n1 as others have pointed out your grind should be somewhat courser than for most espresso machines if it s too fine you will not get much espresso to flow as the manual states n n2 do not tamper the coffee too much once again a hard tamper will restrict flow make you think the machine is n t working n n3 the machine is a little messy because by design based on many reviews i ve read the grinds do n t end up as a hard puck but rather somewhat watery when you are ready to dispose of them you inevitably get a little spillage from the brew head also both the frother and the brew spouts are too short you ca n t brew into a real cup and frothing means having to tip the frothing pitcher to get it on and off but hey do you want everything for 150 it produces a good espresso shot decent crema and is attractive as a bonus just be willing to play around with it for a few days for best results
4;24;54;0.77549172733687;i bought this machine for my husband for christmas based on amazon s customer reviews nat first it seemed like a pretty good machine even though it dripped badly despite the touted no drip feature it is our first pump machine so the ability to make lots of steamed milk was a big plus even though we did n t think the coffee came out as well as our 10 year old bottom of the line krups nhowever it started malfunctioning quickly the sliding knob to control amount of coffee did not work sometimes only an ounce of coffee would come out sometimes several ounces no matter how it was set nfinally hardly anything was coming out i figured it was obstructed and i started soaking the filter in vinegar overnight this would work for a day or so then no coffee again we called the 800 number on the back of the machine and they said to send it our responsibility to pay the postage to new york for repair nwe use only filtered water in the machine and there is no scale built up anywhere the machine is 3 months old and looks new it just does n t work i will not be buying this kind of thing online anymore it s too messy and inconvenient to deal with problems i m sticking with books and records
5;54;23;0.7720628710539778;i liked this machine when i first got it the shots of espresso were consistently dark and hot and had a nice layer of crema but after a couple of months of moderate at least twice daily use it developed a couple of annoying problems the first was with the crema filter it got to a point where coffee only barely came out of the thing let alone crema even though i cleaned the filter often i solved this problem myself with the help of a straight pin and it worked fine ever after then the frothing attachment literally blew out from the steam pressure even though i had the steam knob full off at the time no biggie i thought i purchased a separate milk frother to take the place of the attachment finally the machine quit working altogether after a little more than a year s worth of usage and regular cleanings too i did take care of the machine unfortunately the only thing the warranty covers for any decent length of time is the pump which was n t what failed
6;36;26;0.741850104841152;i bought this machine in november 2001 based largely on the positive reviews here but since then i ve noticed that most of the positive reviews of the briel chamonix are from customers who have only had it a few days or weeks my machine worked great for a few weeks it made excellent espresso and produced a lot of steam unfortunately after a couple months it started to leak not a few drops either streams of water run out of every opening and flood my countertop then the steamer stopped working today 9 months and numerous replacement parts repairs later i finally gave up and bought a new one from starbucks i used my old starbucks machine for 7 years before i upgraded to the briel and i never had a problem with it the construction was exceptional and the customer service unbeatable the briel machine is going in the trash
7;18;10;0.7186552840622997;we enjoyed an il primo for many years but we did n t know what we were missing this espresso is so smooth you wo n t believe it the unit is not as brain dead easy as the il primo but you will be rewarded with amazing espresso and meringue like foam it is a bit drippy like the other reviews said n neven in you do n t buy this machine you must get a unit with a pump and dual temperature control n nsome additional hints n n lavazza is fabulous italian espresso it comes pre ground so you do n t have to worry about the coarseness of the grind n n it has a slider for the amount of coffee espresso it makes but keep it on the lowest setting after the first ounce or two all you are doing is adding bitter flavor all the good stuff is already in the cup n nif you spend more i seriously doubt you are getting better espresso cappuccino just features
8;2;7;0.5819158700384021;perfect espresso first time and every time virtually fool proof but then growing in my foolishness the magic crema disc must do the trick combined with the higher pressure of 15 bars stovetop machines ca n t force the steam through the coffee correctly because they only generate 3 bars atmospheres what sold me was the 10 year guarantee on the pump if most espresso machines can do the job i wanted one that would last i looked at machines from 20 closeouts to 2000 commerical models this is the lowest priced with the best features anything cheaper does n t give you the pressure except the briel s lido nor the autoflow so you do n t have to hold down a lever just set it and forget it for a minute anything more expensive does n t add much more than aesthetics and commercial capacity oops got ta go it s getting cold

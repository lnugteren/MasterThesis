0;53;76;0.8576541109852733;i ve only had it a week so my opinion may change with longer usage this was easy to assemble and is lightweight but does n t feel unsafe or rickety it does exactly what i need and i get a decent workout the computer on it is kind of a joke you ca n t adjust any settings for age weight etc i have noticed that it squeaks as other reviewers have mentioned it s a little annoying and it s not a consistent noise i have n t noticed it overheating and i ve checked after a 45 min workout overall i m pleased with this stepper n n4 30 12 update this squeaks louder than ever and all the time now after a week of regular use i tried silcone lubricant and it worked for a couple minutes i contacted the manufacturer today and they got back to me within a couple of hours and suggested wd 40 they said if it did n t work they d send new hydraulics to me asap the wd 40 improved the volume of the squeak but it s still there i m going to try it for another day and then i ll ask for a replacement part from sunny i m still pleased with how the product functions and the manufacturer has been great so far about dealing with the issue
1;73;70;0.8575423324174184;i m pretty lazy when it comes to working out it s boring i admit that i bought a bike and i can do that while zoning out to some music but i let my parents use it i have extremely limited space so i needed either another tiny bike or something like this because i wanted a treadmill or an elliptical or a bike n nit was pretty simple to put together but pay attention if you are not the type to assemble things because the pieces were n t necessarily put in the box the way the directions were instructing i like putting together workout equipment though it s my favorite part of buying the stuff and a workout in itself n nthis is tough on the legs if you do n t do much movement which i do n t my goodness you have to adjust the tension of course i ve only had this for a couple of weeks and truthfully right now i can do about five minutes then i have to do something else i do have joint problems though and it s not because i m lazy that s because of chocolate and my inability to not eat it n n anyway it can be wobbly and again if you do n t adjust it you ll be done in under ten minutes be wise on this purchase i like it but if you re larger than me you may want to reconsider i m around 5 3 and i wear a size 8 shoe in women s and i m over 180 i got my dad to try it out and he s a pretty tall semi big dude his feet looked awkward he wears a size 12 and i was scared he was going to fall he s over 70 and has bad knees so it s not for the unstable like i said be wise as to whether this product will fit your size and your body mass overall i d say give it a try for the price and the size i m guessing it ca n t be too hard to return this if it does n t work out
2;30;17;0.8562621007330447;i was so excited when i got this stepper and surprised at its quality when it arrived it took me just a few minutes to put it together and i liked that the handlebar was adjustable i actually thought it was a bit small and i could n t imagine how a taller person would be able to use it comfortably i am 5 2 and felt cramped on it but i needed something small so could n t complain nit did n t take long for it to start squeaking some times quite loudly even after lubing it but it was still a great way to workout unfortunately it took me more than 30 days to figure out that the intense pain i got in my poor flat feet was not going to get any better and i was lucky if i could go 10 minutes on it if you have fallen arches this one might not be a good choice for you and in my case arch supports only made it worse i wish the stepper with the standard motion had a handlebar because i need it for balance and i think it would have hurt less than the twister ni finally gave up on it after six months and gave it to a friend all that said if you do n t have any foot problems this one will kick your butt in a hurry and give you a great workout ni truly wish it could have worked for me
3;54;69;0.8493202466009643;i was n t expecting a whole lot for the small price and the box was pretty light when i brought it in from the porch but after my husband put it together in under 30 minutes i stepped onto it and absolutely fell in love this thing is very well made and solidly built i still ca n t believe that it does n t weigh very much i began using it and after about a week began to feel better my knee that used to hurt no longer hurts my leg muscles are much stronger and i am not out of breath after walking long distances or up hill best 72 i ever spent for my health i love the sunny twister and highly recommend it i am in my early 60s and fairly sedentary this is just what i needed the handle bar is great but i do n t hold onto it for dear life it is just there for balancing and it is honing my ability to balance better older folks have a problem with that when i just lightly hold onto the handle i am 5 5 and weigh 150 it is the perfect size for me a very very heavy person might not get much out of this though but for me it is perfect
4;9;86;0.8356875872037308;this just arrived so it s too soon to say but i really miss my aspen stepper that lasted forever and would probably still be going strong if i had n t lent it to my kids who left it out in the rain and ruined it n npros it was relatively easy to assemble it s made of steel rather than plastic it has a built in timer also a scan calorie counter and stroke counter but the accuracy of these things is dubious at best and i m not one to use them anyway it does n t take up much space and is easy to move n ncons the tension adjustment knob is a joke from the easiest to the most difficult setting is so subtle i barely noticed it even at the most difficult setting going as fast as i could i did n t perspire at all for people who are used to steppers the twisting motion is a bit awkward and since it came with no exercise instructions perhaps there s something i m missing to the advantages of twisting at full extension the handle bars do n t go up very high and they do n t move n nif you re someone just embarking on an exercise routine do n t want to spend a lot of money and do n t have a lot of space this will probably work just fine however for the athletically inclined who already work out regularly this will probably be a bit of a disappointment n nupdate have now had this for a while and need to mention that 1 the tension adjustment knob does work but only works if you let the stepper sit for at least a couple of hours if you try adjusting it without letting is sit undisturbed you will not feel any difference and 2 the 250 weight limit is a joke my husband who weighs 195 ca n t use it at all if he does the cable screws as others have commented break off he s handy so he s been able to fix it each time but after 3 or 4 times he just will no longer use it for me it s not much of a work out but i do use it n nupdate a little over a year later the cable broke and the manufacturer has been unresponsive so into the trash it sadly goes due to a major design flaw in construction the cable is forced to stretch wear down and eventually break with use over time a hydraulic resistance system would be a major design improvement so if you do n t mind a machine that will only last about a year this stepper is fine but if you want something that will last longer i d give it a miss
5;22;14;0.8321906026106137;i loved this thing when it arrived it is true that it is very hard to pedal even at the lowest setting as other reviewers have mentioned i am in my 20 s with strong legs and walk several miles a week to get to school and to public transportation but even that is not the reason i m giving a low review n ni wanted to keep using this stepper i loved the easy exercise at home and how refreshed i felt after using it i have a congenital disorder causing very high insulin requiring a strict diet and exercise program diet alone was n t nearly enough to get my insulin under control and this machine was really helping me with insulin related sleepiness and visceral fat weight you gain from hormones only around the middle and not other areas of the body for reference i m 5 4 and about 150 lbs when i got this i was about 4 or 5 pounds heavier i think i kept having the sensation that the handle bars were in the wrong place maybe someone taller would find it more comfortable i kept having to lean forward which caused lower back pain and knee pain the back pain subsided as i gained strength the knee pain did not n nthis stepper is a straight path to a hip and knee injury i understand that it said twister stepper but until you exercise with lateral twisting on your hips and knee joints you do n t realize how uncomfortable it is i was expecting lateral movement like an elliptical but it s more like the sensation of someone holding your leg and twisting it clockwise and counterclockwise repeatedly my boyfriend who is in extremely good shape from hard outdoor labor 40 hours a week tried it and could n t stand how the exercise felt he said something just seems wrong about how this moves i m now seeing a physical therapist at a top research hospital for joint issues for the first time in my life and she recommended i stop using it she said i should use a regular stepper without twisting or a reclining bike or walking in a pool until my hip recovers n nthis is stable sturdy and well constructed durable but it is not ergonomic and that matters much more than i thought it did when i purchased n nif you have absolutely no joint issues and plan to exercise infrequently this stepper might be for you but make sure you are prepared to take on the risk of possible joint injury
6;8;52;0.8169522413882752;i am around 163 pounds n27 years old n5 4 and this little thing got me tired by even just 30 seconds into the workout i did not want to give up just yet because i really wanted to get my money s worth i had eaten two subway oatmeal cookies which total 400 calories i really wanted to burn those suckers off but with only doing 1442 repetitions in 30 minutes i managed to burn 205 calories that s what the monitor read n n pros n n1 it will get the job done i know it s cheap and looks like it s not a lot but it got my front thighs and my upper butt cheeks on fire i would love a full and firm butt not only for looks but your butt muscles are the biggest muscles and if those are firm they really help out with your metabolism or so leslie sansone said i was really tired on the first round but i had to push myself n n2 you can adjust the tension resistance at the bottom front if you want to push yourself i had to loosen it it s really tough work n n3 it s not heavy at all or takes up a lot of room no it can not fold for lower storage n n4 it does record your time your repetitions and calories burned n n5 the machine will not reset your progress so if you stop working out like to go to the bathroom or answer the door it will pause until you come back n n6 it does not make a lot of noise n n cons n n1 the machine is very simple meaning there s not a lot to it for example there s no place to hold your remote or water bottle n n2 it does not record your heart rate n n3 the manual instructions was a little confusing despite putting it together around 30 minutes there was a picture in the instructions with all the parts creating a skeletal scene of it and that was rather more helpful than the actual instructions n n neutral n n1 the stem coming up does rock a little but not much it could just be the way that i set it together sometimes i m afraid to even lean on it n n2 i m 5 4 as described earlier but getting on it makes me feel like i m too tall the machine is not very leveled as if it makes me feel like there was a part i missed that i did not install n noverall i love the machine it s not perfect but i m glad i m getting something out of it i will continue to give some updates as i go becuase i read that this thing does break apart earlier than expected so we ll see n n2 16 14 update ni m continuing on the stepper and you guys have no idea how much my upper buns are on fire this stuff is very tough and i do n t even have it on high resistance it s tough i do n t really feel it as much in my back leg but rather my front thighs but the butt area is the worst that s what makes you want to get off n n3 2 14 update nthe stepper is still going strong and the workout is still very tough i managed to get past 30 minutes and into maybe 45 minutes becuase i played a video game and that really got me distracted from the workout
7;6;60;0.8098399279458787;i m an exercise professional and bought this for home use when we moved to the beach and there were no near by gyms i was a little skeptical because it was inexpensive but it s great it s a solid piece of equipment that has held up perfectly for over a year now i also was skeptical that i d get a good work out from it since some home workout equipment is too easy but it is a good workout the tension adjusts easily without having to get off the machine so i can start out warming up with lots of support to make it easy them turn the dial to increase the speed an get a harder workout it is extremely light weight and easy to move around i was able to move it anywhere in the house i wanted to exercise simply and easily i love that it s designed with the foot pedals at a perfect angle to strengthen hip muscles it s also a great angle to protect the knees i like the way it tracks the number of steps in a single work out and over time what an awesome value thanks sunny health fitness for making an affordable solid product
8;68;37;0.79497897321416;this thing is awesome mine gets used daily and after about two years just squeaks a bit it has been through multiple moves due to us being military and i bring it on trips when i can and is just so easy i have many many machines all very expensive and nice but use this the most it is small and compact enough to leave out in our living room and not be intrusive on everyone the price is unbeatable and for those saying it breaks after a couple months who are very heavy people you would need commercial equipment to handle that type of weight for long periods of time but for the price even replacing it every couple months to get your results would be worth it as a female at 5 4 and 130 lbs finishing working off the baby weight from 4 it has stood the test of time and moves beyond expectations i actually came on to get one as a gift n nupdated going on five years with this and i have no idea how people are breaking this so easily it is a perfect little simple machine with so many benefits despite knee surgeries a lifelong bad back and blood clots in my legs this is a god send even my kids and husband jump on it my little toddler already tries stepping
9;74;53;0.7912904908535302;it took me less than a half an hour to put this machine together really easy instructions and so simple without any outside tools needed and i am not mechanically inclined the handlebar is great but remember to tighten the screws at the base again after you use it the first few times as it will get kind of loose with the first use the size is perfect as it is very small and fits into my small loft easily without sticking out into the living area i work out regularly and bought this to increase the intensity of my jogging in place in side my house i jog for 10 minutes and then do the stepper for 5 as an interval program even though i am in good shape the stepper really gets my heart rate going before i go back to jogging for another ten minutes i work out for about an hour alternating between the stepper and jogging you can feel your muscles working right away not only in your legs but surprising for me also in your abs you may not get a totally accurate calorie count on the monitor since you do not enter your weight or age but it is close enough i debated between this small machine and the much more expensive larger boxflex treadclimber this machine may not last as long or have all the bells and whistles of the other machine but it does the job and for the price if it breaks after a year or two i will just buy another i love it
10;45;18;0.7568588120716665;i ve just put the sunny stepper together without a hitch i love the way it feels with the ample sized steps and handle bars for sprint stepping it s sturdy and just the right price and size getting cheaper by the minute i m starting off slow and easy since it takes only a half a minute for me to get out of breath on it i bought this mainly so i can do low impact exercises throughout the winter and in the heat of the summer what s even better is i can hide it in my closet when i want it out of sight a happy purchase
11;47;12;0.7408113089090559;i really enjoy working out with step machines when i belonged to a gym it was easy but one of those machines cost 1000 not to mention they are way to big for my home after looking at reviews on this site and others i decided to order it it is exactly what i wanted it gives a great workout and you can tighten or relax the tension it also has a little computer that shows your time steps etc i was afraid that it would n t be very stable but i put a yoga mat under this on hardwood floor without a problem
12;28;15;0.7328440250857221;totally love this stepper the hubby and i live in small townhouse so space is limited i needed something that could fit in our coat closet for storage purposes and its perfect it only took about 10 15 minutes to set up i set the stepper up right in front of my tv and put on a show that i need to catch up on netflix and work out i am an introvert and germophobe so i do n t care for gyms so i thought this would be perfect to work out on especially it being winter time i am unable to take my walks that i was taking during the spring and summer and those walks were keeping me in shape but since winter had arrived i knew i needed something and this was the answer
13;58;28;0.7200830692280087;this is a great compact stair stepper we were looking for something that was small enough to fit in our room without taking up too much space but not super cheap in quality this one is great it fits nicely in the corner area behind our closet door so its perfect it has a knob to adjust the tension so you cant just hit a button up or down to adjust but i simply set it before getting on i prefer the highest setting so its perfect the handle bars adjust tall enough for my husband and short enough to where even my little guy 5 can get on and use it if he wanted that is a simple knob adjustment also there is a small counter to record your steps and time it will hold the numbers til your next session or you can hold the button to reset and begin again nthe only negative thing i have to say about this which is really very minor is that the bolts at the base of the hand bar work loose very easily but its nothing a little lock tight could n t fix noverall this is an excellent buy for the money
14;43;35;0.7026261509383861;i have an original straight up and down pedal step movement mini stepper and it is ok but i do n t love it lol nbut this stepper with the down and slight outward which is the twist pedal step movement is so much easier on your hip and knee joints it is a more fluid motion and i love it this stepper has a smoother motion than the regular mini stepper it is extremely quiet compact smooth easy to do and fun handle is perfect addition for stability also i love it so much i just bought my daughter one for christmas awesome price with free shipping too thanx amazon
15;7;16;0.6158915798260131;we wanted a stair stepper but did n t have space for a standard one this solved the problem we tuck it in a corner that measures 20 x 20 inches and bring it out when we re ready to use it it s that easy to move it may seem a little tippy due to its light weight but that goes away as soon as you put your weight on it it s really remarkably designed and well constructed it will have you breathing hard in a few minutes and the resistance can be adjusted to increase your level of exertion due to its small size it may not be perfect for a large man but if you re average sized and need a stepper but do n t have space for a big one this is a great quality product for a reasonable price
16;29;10;0.5264096039815513;this definitely served its purpose got a great cardio work out in i included a kutting weight sauna shirt and 5 lbs weights for added calorie burn it was easy to assemble took about 30 mins very sturdy in an 40 min workout i burned up to 540 calories according to my fitbit just what i need when i wan na get a good sweat at home fits right in my room does n t need alot of space
17;46;11;0.4476309754096754;i have had this for about 2 months now i have been using it 3 4 times a week and it definitely makes me sweat it is definitely now the gym high tech stepper for for 60 it does a great job for 20 30 minutes and an average of 250 300 calories i give it a 5 stars ni will definitely recommend its purchase

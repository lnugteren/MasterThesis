0;3;14;0.7926722609660822;i grew up with a bongo board which is the same as the balance board except the base ie the thing the board rolls on is terrible it comes in multiple pieces of circles you have to assemble to make it the wood shreds when you roll on it it also does n t feel very stable i wished i had spent a couple extra dollars and gotten the all plastic one or the pivet board we have n t even really used it because it makes a mess and i am scared it will break this is one item i may have to bring back i loved my bongo board growing up and it was so much fun i thought it would be fun for my children too unfortunately i picked the wrong one
1;4;13;0.778346818914187;i love this balance board i got it for myself an adult and i use it to supplement other workouts it really gives your ankle leg muscles you do n t ordinarily use a great workout it s challenging but not exausting i have set it up on the carpet in front of the tv and once i m on it s hard to stop i also put down an old bathroom mat underneath to protect the carpet i imagine it would be a lot more challenging if it were used on a hard flat surface like linoleum or wood but do n t have that option in my house the wheel part of my board came in the box fully assembled so i m not sure what happened with the reviewer below who had to assemble this piece herself do n t know how durable it is since i ve had mine less than a year but so far so good a word of warning if you have little people or curious pets in the house make sure they are well out of the way since you can lose your balance quickly and send the board flying out from underneath you overall highly recommended
2;14;7;0.60958637706728;this toy is exactly like the indo boards that are almost twice the price it is so much fun for anyone but it is also wonderful for skateboarders surfers dancers any athlete and anyone who wants to improve thier balance physical therapists often use a board and a foam roller to help patients i would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 8 but you can hardly seperate kids from them is a great ab and thigh exercise you can do while watching tv make sure to try on a carpet surface first board can shot out suddenly if you lean over to far need at least a four or five foot open space to do it safely
3;9;4;0.538324685213107;although this product shows a wheel underneath the board what is actually there is a series of wood cut out circles and squares that you assemble alternately yourself this construction is wobbly and does not result in a tight wheel the board is hard enough to balance on from side to side without the added instability

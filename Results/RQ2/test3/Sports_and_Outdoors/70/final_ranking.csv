0;7;68;0.8857252514108486;this is my initial review on the bag i will add a followup review after a 3 day backpacking trip next weekend n npros quite a few generally happy with initial inspection nlots of adjustments na decent number of pockets and options for storage example would be a mesh velcro pocket on the face of the bag good for maps energy bars etc nstraps seem to be of decent overall quality and there is what looks like a sleeping bag sleeping pad strap near the bottom of the bag there is also two straps on the very top of the bag that seem like they could be used to strap something down nice to have the option to securely strap some gear to the outside of the bag n2 mesh water bottle pockets on either side could n t tell by the product description or pictures but they are there phew nbright yellow rain cover is located in a nifty pocket at the very bottom of the bag nice feature na few loops on the outside for strapping things down nholds up to a 3 liter bladder with an exit whole and clips to keep in reach nseems to be of durable build and quality field tests soon n ncons only one real con for me two cons if you are taller nsleeping bag compartment is small well actually its initially more of an issue with it s opening i have a decently small winter bag that i ca n t fit in when its in it s stuff sack at all if i take the bag out of the stuff sack and stuff it into the compartment it just barely fits nice to know that it could though for me i will most likely use the straps on the outside of the bag to hold my sleeping bag i have hooked it up and it seems to work pretty well almost like it was made to hold a sleeping bag 4000ci is not that much room for a winter backpacking trip so having my sleeping bag on the outside will create a decent amount of space for say my clothes sleeping pad and cooking gear in the sleeping bag compartment if you are someone who must have a sleeping bag compartment this will work for summer camping but a winter sleeping bag will be very tough to fit in the one and only con for me but big enough to deter some people if you are someone who does n t mind sticking the sleeping bag on the outside where it would work out just fine in the bag s straps then this con is not that much of an issue nnot for tall people this bag seems to fit me ok but i am not a very big guy i m about 5 9 5 10 and it is a close fit i think it will work just perfectly for me but if you are above 6 ft or anything beware then again i am pretty new to backpacking and this is my first pack n noverall nin the end i bought this smaller bag over the cheaper and larger cuscus bags because of the many reviews those had with cheap build quality they get a lot of space with their big bag but have a lot of issues with bag quality i sacrificed some space for quality and extra features i am a little disappointed by the small backpack compartment but if i have my pack on the outside this bag should work quite perfectly i d say for summer camping this bag is perfect and for winter camping if you can stick your sleeping bag on the outside this bag is near perfect i will do an update in about a week after i give this bag a good hard test n n4 5 stars for not being 100 perfect but an overall good bag n nupdate nwent for my november 3 day backpacking trip and this bag performed perfectly was comfortable and carried all of my gear with ease i was able to pack up everything and more the pack worked as good as i hoped it would and with the sleeping bag in the straps on the outside it was a non issue no complaints no problems this bag is awesome great deal love it
1;26;53;0.8584229352938244;i bought the teton sports explorer 4000 in august i needed a new pack as i was getting back into backpacking had a trip coming up this fit the bill cheap fit my size 6 3 260 lbs linebacker type build big enough to hold my gear i have been thoroughly impressed with the pack so have my friends who i go backpacking with my pack has gone with me on 5 short trips 2 3 days since i have bought it is going on at least 1 more before the year is out n nthere are a lot of good things to say about this pack it rides really nice on my back with the support stays you can get it to fit really comfortably pull them out have someone bend them to your back then put them back in the spots the panel that separates the sleeping bag compartment from the main compartment can zipped open so you have a top bottom loading pack in other reviews i have read complaints about the sleeping bag compartment if you have a down bag no problem fitting it in i have a slumberjack ultimate 30 long bag it is a synthetic bag which does n t compress as much as a down bag it is about as big of a bag as i can put in there a warmer weather like a slumberjack 45 will flip right in just fine a comparable down bag will fit just fine but mine takes a little jockeying but not too much n nthe compression straps on the outside are big enough to hold a decent sized tent the top will hold a sleeping pad without a problem if not you can remove the straps or just pull them flat the vertical compression straps work well to shrink the height of the pack makes it feel smaller than it is when out on the trail n none particular feature i like is the fact that behind the side pockets there is a pass through for trekking poles tent poles tripod monopod or whatever else you need of that general size shape the pockets that this slides behind are floated so you do n t lose the ability to use the pockets this is just a smart design the larger side pocket left side can fit my water pump katadyn hiker pro in it s bag the right side has 2 smaller pockets that holds emergency rain gear fire starter kit granola bars cliff bars cards camera etc just fine the bottom of the 2 pockets is a little tough to use if you fill the top pocket on the right side you can not access these pockets with the pack on your back n nthe lid is not removable for a fanny pack or day pack which i do n t like but it works well it has a rather large top pocket that you can put in anything you need to grab that you do n t want buried in your pack i have put a group first aid kit toiletries etc in there that you need there is a privacy pouch on the inside of the top which is perfect for keys wallet phone etc anything you really do n t need when you are out on the trail but want no chance of losing n nthe rainfly covers my entire pack with a tent on the outside bottom if i had the tent something on top it would n t cover everything with the rainfly being bright yellow it also would work well as a flag if you are lost in the woods it can detach by undoing the buckle n ninside i am able to fit a compression dry bag jet boil thermarest prolite plus pillow food bag bladder jacket and whatever else i need it does n t fill it up my sleeping bag goes in the sleeping bag compartment my tent hangs off the lower compression strap i hook rope on the back daisy chains there is plenty of room left my pack hauls about 30 34 lbs every time i go out it does it without a problem i feel like i am hiking with a lot less on my back n nso with all those good things i just said why did i not give it 5 stars my third trip the rainfly zipper broke it still slid back forth but the actual zipper handle came off fortunately i found it some of the zippers do n t move as easily as i would like i wish it had a pair of hip belt pockets but it does n t come with them when you are hiking it can squeak i have also found that i have to keep pulling the shoulder straps tight as the pack keeps loosing up over the distance of a hike the buckle holding the sternum slipped loose on the shoulder strap but i just rethreaded it on it works fine it has verticle compression straps but i wish it also had horizontal compression straps yes these are all minor no not a one of these would keep me from buying this pack n noverall it is a well designed pack it does n t weight too much it is n t an ultralighter it is a fantastic pack to get out to the great outdoors in this pack will get you there back it will also let you figure out what you want in your next pack for the price you really ca n t beat it
2;5;49;0.8472932350170893;i recieved this pack a few days ago and to be honest i was concerned that it would n t adjust to fit me i am 6 3 tall and did n t see many reviews about tall people this pack more than adjusted to fit me it had room to spare i actually have it one notch below the max the great thing about this pack is that my wife 5 4 can also wear the same pack and for that reason we will be ordering a second pack n nbesides the height i felt this pack was more than adequate for capacity i read many reviews about the small sleeping bag pouch but i was able to fit my summer bag 40 tent stakes and tent rainfly in the pouch with room to spare i will just strap my tent poles on the side which has straps specifically for that purpuse i do have a large winter bag which would be snug but i would definitly strap that on the outside with all the extra straps this pack has this pack has hidden pockets just about everywhere which is nice when you have lots of gear you want to get at without unpacking everything n ni started stuffing all my things in this pack to see what kind of balance it had and it felt great and was very sturdy i posted a picture on here to see it on a tall person but please note only had it 3 4 full i will try and update this post after i use it on the lake superior hiking trail this fall n nlet be honest though the real reason i bought this pack was for the price wow great pack for the money you could almost compare this pack to a 300 pack from rei i hope that teton keeps the price low and they will sell a ton of these
3;29;55;0.846541314898005;this is a funny review for me to write had i written this a few days earlier it would be much more positive the story goes like this i took the sports explorer 4000 on a 4 night backpacking adventure in the olympic national wilderness the bag performed admirably throughout the trip once adjusted properly the bag was extremely comfortable on my 6 2 skinny male frame it survived nearly 40 miles of hiking up and down mountains climbing over downed trees and several river fords i give the bag five stars for its performance during that trip n nthe reason i am giving it only two stars is because a week after i returned from the trip i was removing the backpack from my car using the main shoulder strap when i pulled to lift it up the strap s seam ripped and completely separated from the backpack i found it slightly hilarious that the bag could stand up to the backpacking trip but could n t handle being lifted out of my car also i am very thankful that this did not happen while on my trip as it would ve made the long hike significantly less enjoyable n nall that being said i really want to like this bag it performed great when i needed it to and maybe it will for you too i am not sure if i just had a bad bag or if all the seams are defective regardless i encourage you to give it a try as it is a great bag for the price assuming it does n t break but be warned if a major rip like i had happened on the trail you could find yourself in some trouble in the woods
4;46;33;0.8399520862643636;while there are many better more expensive packs than this there are also many more expensive packs that do n t touch this i particularly like the adjustable torso length on the back spine the lumbar belt and adjustable straps this pack can fit most people very comfortably considering the heavy load you can carry the straps at the top bottom can accommodate a tent bag or something else n npeople have remarked the sleeping bag compartment is small but i disagree i have a compression bag that fits in there along with an inflatable sleeping pad and i could probably stuff more any sleeping bag meant for backpacking will almost definitely fit in here yes a winter bag that small is very expensive but that s what it s for it should be noted that the sleeping bag compartment also has a zipper so you can access the bottom contents of your pack from there if necessary n nthe pockets on top and sides are of good quality and are great for quick access items its also very nice that the side pockets have space behind them so you can slide tent poles etc behind them even when full into the pack for whatever you need n nthe main compartment is of good quality and this pack is big enough for most trips if you pack it right no complaints it also has a rain fly that had no trouble covering my backpacking tent strapped to the outside in addition to the whole pack the fly is removable if desired and also bright yellow for emergency purposes n noverall for the price this pack is extremely high quality i ve gone on several treks with it and it has held up wonderfully
5;12;58;0.8343617642600151;first of all this was my first hike and i knew about it a year in advance for the reservation due to our large group 30 and the well known phantom ranch with that said i had plenty of time to research browse compare at nearby stores academy sports dick s cabela s and bass pro shop online pricing reviews for the price the size and the good reviews nothing compared to the teton 4000 at 57 free shipping the grey was cheaper at 6 less than the blue not sure why i wanted the grey anyway i was pleased to receive it within a week of ordering when i first received it i noticed the tag small booklet that came along with it it gave a brief instruction and description of every part of the backpack very helpful for my hike i was able to fit a 4 man tent sleeping bag at the base compartment where it was intended mess kit a point and shoot camera and a dslr camera on the side zipper pockets 3 available 2 on one side 1 on the other along with 2 mesh pockets on each side for water bottles portable stove with butane flashlight knife extra clothes snacks sleeping mat and flip flops total weight about 45 lbs it was snug but the strap and the stiching held up well i gave this a 4 out of 5 star only due to the shoulder straps digging into my shoulders i adjusted it to have most of the weight supported by my hips but that still did n t help my solution was to release the sternum strap and have the shoulder straps more open and parallel to my arm pit or shoulder ball joint hope that makes sense this relieved the soreness but after a while i had to relieve my shoulder ball joint and strapped the sternum once again just to even it out i notice one thing with other hikers with the high dollar backpacks was the shoulder straps having more width and cushion this would probably help the teton 4000 get my 5 star overall i was very happy with my purchase and i would recommend this internal frame backpack thanks for reading
6;13;6;0.8336569559139266;i m a big guy 6 1 260 pounds with a 21 5 torso length and a 44 waist this pack fits although the chest strap will be too tight come winter when i have to layer up this pack is well made and comfortable to wear and it s large size is perfect for multiple day outings with my dog if you utilize the attachment straps on the top and bottom you could easily use this pack for a camping trip that lasted a week or longer depending on the gear you take i can pack a naturehike 3p 3 person tent with footprint 10x10 chill gorilla tarp 3 inflatable pillows static v luxe sleeping pad food for myself and my dog sawyer mini filter 3 litres of water cook kit fire making kit small first aid kit folding saw mora knife 3 headlamps small led lantern battery bank cordage collapsible dog bowls sleeping bag and two complete changes of clothes with room to spare internally so the rain cover fits i use the bottom loops to secure my dog s sleeping pad although the rain cover would n t cover it completely it s easy enough to slide it inside of a garbage bag to keep it dry if i did n t have to dog supplies i could pack in two weeks worth of food and clothes with no trouble the side pockets allow you to slide hiking poles fishing rod ax hatchet folding saw tri pod or other similar items behind them to hold it securely to the outside of the pack although not all of it at the same time all in all it s a great pack for the price n nmore importantly teton s customer service also deserves 5 stars and reading customer reviews about their customer service was the main reason i chose to purchase a teton pack here s my experience with them n nthis was my first adjustable pack and my gf misunderstood what i was asking her to do when measuring my torso and we got it wrong the first time i ordered the scout 3400 which turned out to be too small so i had to return it no problem there that s when i ordered the explorer and the first one i received was what i would call a factory second it was obvious that bag was overlooked by qc it had threads hanging off of it all over the place one strap was sewn on backwards the zipper in the lid would n t zip completely closed and would work it s way open about 3 inches just from walking around with the pack on and one of the shoulder straps was frayed badly i contacted teton again about this pack provided some photos and they sent a replacement the very next day no questions asked on top of all that i mentioned in the email to teton that the chest strap is pretty tight and they offered to make me a custom extension for the strap n nas far as i m concerned this is a company that knows how to take care of their customers and stand behind their products 100 they ve earned my loyalty and respect and i would not hesitate for a moment to recommend them to anyone i know personally this is one company that you can truly buy from with confidence that they will be there for you when you need them to be awesome
7;20;32;0.82876680124142;update i received the new backpack a within the week and while i have yet to test it on a real trip anywhere it is doing a great job of lugging all my things through road trips and airports nothing has broken yet but i will be sure to inform you all if it does and the actions i will take n ni bought this pack a month ago about and took it on its first trip last weekend i had planned an 8 mile round trip hike with a camp stop in the middle this pack was very comfortable and carried all the stuff that i needed and all the stuff that i may not have needed but took anyway we made great time both days and had a blast at the end of the hike back about 200 ft from the car thank goodness the load lifter strap broke and i had to lug this now awkwardly balanced backpack the rest of the way n nwhy 4 stars then n nbecause i went straight to the teton website and complained as a consumer i have the right to make my issues known and ask for an appropriate response and on teton s contact page i did just that i received an email about 5 minutes later telling me that my complaint had been acknowledged and that i needed to send photos of the broken strap once i sent the pictures i received profuse apologies about the broken strap and was assured that a new pack would be sent at this exact minute it has been 15 minutes from my original complaint and i already have a new backpack on its way here for free that s customer service
8;39;36;0.8243383312502377;after all the reviews i read and i read them all the good the bad the in betweens i decided to get this because it was affordable and had mostly favorable reviews first thing my straps have not broken so maybe teton did something about the weak strap stitching from previous models to rectify that issue i have also never over stuffed the bag when i load up for a week long trip i bring a bunch of stuff sleeping bag pad tent or hammock cooking pot ceramic bowl collapsible bowls chop sticks spork food clothes wire fishing line 550 cord cooking stove and fuel med kit fire kit and i m sure i m forgetting something and my bag weighs 33lbs when it is all packed in 47lbs if my cat is riding on top my cat has not damaged the bag with his sharp claws and i have never had any issues with anything there is plenty of room for everything you might take i bring along 2 nalgenes and use a 3 liter bladder which is a little hard to set up and feed through but it works fine and everything else i take and i have never been out of room the pockets are deep and spacious the two pockets on the top cover are great i use one for my med kit and the other for food this bag is very well priced and worth every penny if you compare this bag to the bear grylls bag of the same size this bag will win in ever category and you ll be paying a lot less i would recommend this bag to anyone who wants to try out the internal frame i was external for years and this is my first and only internal frame bag but does n t want to spend a lot of money on something they may not like or anyone who likes to camp with their kids this is an awesome bag
9;21;66;0.8204173507363189;this backpack is awesome this is the first internal frame pack i ve purchased and it s freaking sweet reading the reviews i decided on this one due to some reviews saying it worked for tall people short people can use this too the shoulder straps are adjustable i never thought a backpack could do that but the whole shoulder strap contraption actually shifts up and down giving a great fit for anyone 6 5 like myslef and 220lbs to shorter i m guessing kids could fit super comfortable with it but i m not just talking about straps leading from bottom of backpack to the pit area thoes adjust too but the whole thing does never seen anything like it n nthe only thing bad about it i can think of is the sleeping bag compartment is too small i just unzipped the seperater thing making it one large bag which i kinda like cause it forces me to get a smaller and more lightweight bag for the hiking and snowshoeing oh and the inside compartment barley fit my huge 35 snowshoes n nthis is freaking sweet for the price freaking sweet i used it on one miserable snowshoeing trip so far and it held up great i packed too much stuff making the snowshoeing trip horrible first time ever snowshoeing learned my lesson but my back and shoulders were comfortable with this bag the waist strap helps a ton and with big plastic clip to gether things it was super easy to do up and undo with gloves on time will tell on the zippers and fabric and plastic clip to gether things hold up but from the first abusive trip and from just looking at it i m sure it will i would for sure buy again n nhope this helps the tall people on their purchase we need to look out for each other

11;25;18;0.8077141009234872;ok pack for the price did have a couple issues with it though the aluminum internal frame parts have rubber caps on the ends of them and one of the velcro straps that holds them in was not closed when i received it so what had happened was the frame was pushed up out of the rubber cap on the bottom and would not go back in this caused the frame to stick up past the point the velcro could be closed after about an hour of messing with it i eventually got the frame rod back in its rubber cap and solved that the second issue came when adjusting the pack the bottom cross strap that you wrap the shoulder strap adjustment around just was barely sewn in it is n t an issue for me because i did n t actually need the very bottom one but it is something to consider otherwise i have used it backpacking in the midwest and in glacier national park and i find the pack to be comfortable and well balanced it really does a good job with airflow to your back so you do n t end up soaked this pack is a bit large i m 5 9 10 ish and i have it at nearly the smallest setting the pack itself is incredibly roomy can fit pretty much everything you need for a multiple day hike other than the two issues i had which for me were not a big deal the pack has served well and we will see if it lasts as long as my old kelty guide that this replaced
12;57;52;0.8015998130228513;i originally purchased the teton sports explorer 3500 backpack and that one too is a great pack but i have to carry a sleeping bag roll mat tent water food clothes cook wear ect i decided to give the 3500 to my wife as it was a bit tight with carrying the tent on there i then purchased the 4000 for myself and could carry all the extra equipment i needed including the tent so that to lighten my wife s load also like the other reviews said it was a really tight push putting my sleeping bag in the bottom compartment which you do not have to do as you can open the zipper inside so that you can put it through the top of pack i just prefer to keep it seperate i am 5 10 and either pack fit my back as everything can be adjusted on both packs but my wife is about 5 2 and the teton 3500 fit her better due to the actual size compared to the teton 4000 being slightly larger in capacity hope this helps with your decision
13;9;19;0.7937112050187325;used this pack for a 3 day 20 mile hike i had the pack loaded with 33 lbs of gear the pack worked great with no problems at all once strapped on it was solid with no sliding or moving we made 42 waist deep and very cold river 39 degrees crossings so the pack staying in place was a must we took out the bars and bent them to the contour of my back which worked great no rubbing on shoulders or hips the only thing i wish you could adjust is the position of the chest strap with my body frame it was a little high but still worked was nowhere close to choking me but i like it a little low was it a game changer no the sleeping bag area is to small for a winter bag which i had so i stuffed my tent and ground cover in that part had sleeping bag in bottom of main area loved all the attachment points on the outside i had a fly rod and vest attached to them as you can see in the picture i had it loaded to the max

15;35;12;0.7682587153272018;serious review just received packed and have n t taken on a hike yet but it seems really well designed and sturdy i loaded it up to the brim and hit about 45 pounds total about 20 of my body weight it was tight but it all fit has a lot of options to adjust for your height and preferred point of balance and i ve never bought my own backpack like this before so maybe this is standard on all of them but the zippered pocket at the bottom for your sleeping bag is a great idea not 100 sure the included attached rain cover will fit over wide objects strapped on like tents or sleeping mats n nslighty less serious but not really review feel free to bail out here i bought this backpack as a bug out bag i m a middle to low class suburbanite concerned about emergency preparedness for the first time in my life thanks to the current political climate i just bought a full set of camping equipment for the first time in 25 years my main reasons for picking this bag were its affordability carrying capacity sturdy design and frankly that the green and black will blend into the woods better if society turns into an 80 s sci fi flick these next few months best scenario i ll discover a love for recreational camping in middle age worst case i miiight survive or leave a good cache of supplies for someone else to n ni m telling you all this because i want to share my gear list so you understand what this pack will hold and maybe look into getting similar stuff for yourself over prepare folks so you re not scrambling around like the poor unsuspecting people during katrina n ngear that will fit in this here bag and cost about 1000 total including this here bag n n ultralight sleeping bag in stuff sack n two person tent strapped to top n swiss camo heavy duty rain poncho n aluminum mess kit titanium spork n lifestraw n two collapsible heavy duty plastic canteens folded up n 3 day emergency 3600 calorie food bar pack n 30 day supply of freeze dried food in resealable mylar packages n seed vault in resealable bag 15 000 heirloom vegetable seeds n emergency id credit card passport and money cache n small first aid kit bandages tourniquet cpr mask gloves protective eyewear n 100 feet of 550 paracord n magnesium firestarter n 1 dozen game snares n 6 automatic yoyo fishing reel snares n roll of fishing line hook sinker swivel kit n disassembled slingshot and a bag of 100 metal ammo balls n map of my state n large bottle of permethrin insect repellant n small bottle of seam sealer n large bottle of waterproofing spray n folding camp grill n anker folding solar charging panels n hand crank radio flashlight charger with solar cells n collapsible solar shower bag n tool sharpening puck n ground tarp n trowel n microfiber quick dry towel and hand towel n vanity medical kit including travel versions of camp suds potassium iodide tablets for radiation sickness prevention shampoo deodorant shaving cream razor toothbrush toothpaste some basic cold flu meds ibuprofen tweezers nail clippers unbreakable camp mirror two bars of soap 50 q tips a single pack of tissues a roll of toilet paper with the tube removed squashed flat n neverything i could fit was put into individual ziploc bags with the air squashed out for water protection i ll also be carrying a few tools on my belt a full sized axe in my hand a compass in my pocket and an extra canteen on a carry strap with water purification tablets in its pouch i m a big guy in good shape and the pack feels heavy but i think i could manage it and there are obviously nonessentials i could remove to lessen the weight n nto be clear the goal is to survive and be able to shelter eat and drink if i ca n t achieve these through normal means this is n t for long distance hikes unless absolutely necessary just get to a safe place and hunker down i ve got basic supplies to see me through the first 30 days while i adapt to a lifestyle of scarcity and tools to get food and water after i m not planning to pack extra clothes wearing full body realtree camo with layers i can remove and tie to the pack because if i need this bag for its intended purpose clothes will be the least of my worries there are various other standard camping hiking luxuries i ignored for the same reason n nand like i said hopefully in a few months or four years i ll be able to have a good laugh about how over the top this all was and i ll be an avid recreational camper still using this trusty old pack i ll update my review as i use the pack on weekend camping trips so yeah good backpack so far and good luck out there everybody
16;67;51;0.7656134121558463;i plan on doing some serious camping style traveling and this pack can take me to the moon and back i was so surprised by the quality because of it s price i assumed that it would n t be so great other web sites with similar products like rei had packs in the range of 300 i bought a 3 liter nalgene get a grip water bladder to go inside and it fits perfectly the pack even has a velcro strap to hold the bladder in place along with the inner pocket i was worried that this might be too big for my small female frame 5 4 100 lbs there are so many straps to adjust just about everything to make it fit your body just right
17;3;5;0.7461413408732195;i just received my pack this week i ve loaded and unloaded the pack a few times trying to tweak my load for a 3 day 63 mile florida trail hike from lake okeechobee to hobe sound ocean to lake trail the materials all appear very durable i thought the stitching in some areas would be reinforced a little better like another pack i own but it still seems solid and i do n t see any potential issues the zippers are strong the sleeping bag compartment at the bottom is roomy and the waist belt and shoulder straps are comfy the main compartment side pockets and pockets in the top rain flap are very functional the two aluminum stiffeners are sturdy and well placed the rain cover is completely integrated rip stop material lined for waterproofing and seems perfectly suitable for a torrential downpour n ni have one complaint my waist is 32 inches but i have the waist belt cinched tightly this is kind of concerning you can lose weight during a long trip and may not have a lot of room for adjustments if you have less than a 30 inch waist this probably wo n t work for you fortunately i have a 30 31 waist when i am working out regularly and doing a lot of cardio so it should be fine for me unfortunately my recent workouts are limited to carrying a baby throughout the day and heavy reps curling 12oz ipas n ni ll update my review if i run into any issues after three days of hard use n nupdate 02 07 2018 the pack held up like a champ it was extremely comfortable the waistband and shoulder straps felt great my only wish is it were a pound lighter but its just fine for me i cant justify paying double the price when i do n t have the chance to hike long distances regularly im very glad i bought this pack

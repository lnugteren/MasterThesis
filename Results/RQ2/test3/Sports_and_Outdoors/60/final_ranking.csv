0;49;30;0.782177624708062;this knife is amazing the build quality is everything i expected and so much more my only complaint is the poorly placed rivet on the leather belt loop that some have identified as a possible irritant to the smooth wooden handle n nthere have been some user posted modifications to the belt loop construction that look simple enough to perform i have n t seen any scrapes on the handle yet but i will definitely be looking into the mod just because i want to preserve the beauty of this knife n ni was very surprised with the sharpness of the edge even right out the the box i used this knife in my first processing of a backyard chicken that decided he wanted to crow instead of egg laying and i was very impressed with the ease i had in performing the delicate cuts during skin removal and cleaning since i consider myself a beginner in preparing animals for food i definitely noticed a huge improvement in capability when using a higher quality sharp knife vs a low quality blade that could n t hold an edge to save it s life
1;35;31;0.7654179733002257;this is one of the best hunting knives i have ever touched it is a beautiful knife very heavy solid it is a buck knife which is one of the best money can buy they give you a forever guarantee on the knife not a 1 year not a 20 year not even a lifetime but forever this knife will be handed down to children and grandchildren n nthe blade on the knife is a great length for a deer hunting knife it seems to hold a sharp edge very well and is a good thick steel which wo n t wear out as quickly the handle is a very nicely polished orange colored wood which looks very nice the knife feels very comfortable in my hands i m 6 4 and have good sized hands n nif you take care of this knife it will last through yours and many of your grandchildren s lives

4;4;8;0.7208668705128646;this is buck s best selling model for a good reason it exemplifies the original buck philosophy make a strong utilitarian durable and attractive knife that will superbly undertake its designed purpose i purchased my first buck knife 40 years ago aside from cosmetic blemishes it is as good as ever and am pleased to say that this one is just as good as that knife still made by hand in el cajon california still with a thick and sturdy leather sheath imported now but saddle grade none the less this is an exquisite piece of cutlery besides being an inveterate outdoorsman i am also a chef and am very choosy about my blades i never bought a buck 119 in my youth because in my view it was too big and i also did n t have the disposible income to spend on it simply it is handsome well balanced and a true classic that feels good in your hand it s the 57 chevy of hunting knives and considering inflation a lot less expensive than it used to be i have over a hundred knives of every sort but his one fills a special void in my middle aged life it s perfect do yourself a favor you know you want one so buy one you wo n t regret it

7;54;57;0.674575119985789;knife arrived dull with an uneven edge i ll never buy a another premium grade knife without be able to physically check the edge i wanted a large sharp hunting knife for the upcoming moose season and what i got was a very attactive dull knife that i ca n t get to take an edge i thought i was safe buying from buck but i guess quality is a thing of the past
8;36;17;0.6735268665387217;i do n t think i ve ever held a better knife the weight and balance are on point the grip fits my hand and that cutting edge is phenomenal it s cut through hide and meat on game animals tarps card board thick leather and even other metals there was a job i had taking apart cattle straps and the cutters we were using just were n t doing the job so i asked my superior if i could use my blade i sure am happy that i did cut through everything we were taking apart like butter and still retains its edge to this day the lifetime warranty is another plus as well as sending the knife to buck to get it sharpened if you ca n t do it yourself for 7 n ni plan on buying another one so i can keep this one strictly for hunting you ca n t go wrong with this knife
9;15;21;0.6707116811449201;at first glance this is a good looking knife i observed a botched job on the blood groove very shoddy i could have done better myself i m tempted to return the knives not to mention i can see a future problem with the rivet in the sheath rubbing a hole in the wooden handle sad thing is i bought two of these knives and they both have poor workmanship in the blood groove s the more i think about it the more likely i will return them for a full refund i ve got kabar knives with better quality also a couple schrades with great workmanship for about half the price

13;13;11;0.624683486930065;unlike many people on here for me this knife will probably never skin a deer or any other animal i probably wo n t be wandering off into the wilderness bear grylls style in fact the most action it will likely get is opening amazon boxes n nall that said this is a really beautiful knife incredibly solid great weight n ni ve owned a smaller buck knife before but it always bothered me that the handle was a shade too small for my hand this seems like more of a full sized knife to me very sharp incredibly well made seems like an excellent quality for the price n ni enjoy the warm look of the wood and brass even though i would normally choose a more modern look the old school vintage look of this knife really did appeal n ni thought it was cool that this was a commemorative knife for their 75 year celebration the little logo on the handle is well embedded and does not get in the way n ncould not be more pleased with the knife to me these guys clearly know what they are doing and have a great range of products
14;60;4;0.583115436899835;i bought it because i need a sharp knife i use it for opening packages gardening but not as a steak knife i keep it sharp it s beautifully balanced and comes with a leather case
15;12;5;0.5787046521187227;i have had this particular buck knife for going on about 15 years now it has never failed me has withstood more abuse than i can recollect and through it all has scarcely a blemish and an edge that is still sharp enough with which to shave i have many other knives k bars from my usmc days gerbers pumas case other bucks and all are awesome but this one is very near and dear to me for all it has been through and all it continues to deliver n ndo yourself a service and pick one of these up there is simply no better knife for the money this is one you will hand down to your grandson
16;28;6;0.5136695068008398;this knife is of an excellent quality if sharpened correctly the blade can hold a sharp enough blade to shave with it is perfectly balanced very durable with a thick cross section around 1 8 already sharpened by the manufacture very sharp but not razor sharp and very attractive on your belt or in your hand the leather sheath is of the best quality this is the best knife i own it is worth every penny
17;16;3;0.4237604910048302;i owned this knife close to 40 years ago i really sacrificed at the time very expensive for me then it was stolen about 20 years ago and i have just replaced it due to getting back to the outdoors nthe knife is the same high quality sharp workhorse that it was back then nthe sheath is even of a better quality on this new one thick and indestructible na great gift for the person that demands quality and dependability at an affordable price

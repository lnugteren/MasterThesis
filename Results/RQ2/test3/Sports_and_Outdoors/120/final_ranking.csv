0;34;14;0.9057366868663613;sorry for the super long review here is a short summary and if you want to read the entire life story of my water filter you are welcome to it below npros nhigh quality filters that work really really well nthe pitcher design is well thought out nonly change filters about once every 6 months n ncons nexpensive filters nhave to change the filter immediately after the meter reads 006 about every 6 months nrough edges on pitcher nthe push to dispense spout is a joke n nthis filter is pretty darn good before i purchased it i found several independent studies on the internet including one done by my alma mater that all agreed that zerowater is the best pitcher water filter out there now that doesnt mean this is a super filter or anything like that it is designed to take clean potable water and remove any remaining impurities it is not designed to filter dirty or contaminated water you will clog your filter there are other very good filtration systems out there designed for applications like that n none of the things i really like about the design of this filter is that the filter actually screws into the top of the pitcher and there is a rubber o ring that makes sure you have a tight seal the o ring is part of the filter assembly a new one comes with each filter so you do n t even need to worry about the o ring wearing out over time this design ensures that all the water from the top reservoir has to go through the filter before going into the main body of the pitcher bottom reservoir where you can pour it out this is one of the main reasons why i switched from britta to zerowater i took a look at how my britta filter was working and i noticed that only about half of the water was going through the filter the other half was actually going around it into the bottom reservoir since the filter on a britta is a drop in design the size of the filter has to match the size of the hole in the pitcher exactly if not water will flow around the filter and not much will go through i threw away that filter and tried a new one same problem so i started looking for a better designed water pitcher n ni have owned and used this zerowater pitcher for two years and i definitely think it is the best yes the filters are expensive especially compared to brita filters but with my tap water and usage level i only need to change filters about once every 6 months for the performance and the fact that britta filters are supposed to be changed every 2 months i find that pretty reasonable your mileage may vary depending on how bad your tap water is and how much water your family uses n nthe one bad thing about this filter when the reading reaches 006 on the included meter change the filter as soon as possible not because that level of minerals in the water is suddenly dangerous but because in my experience it is the first sign that the filter is starting to go bad and when the filter goes bad it does so quickly taking regular readings it is my experience that the meter reads 000 for the first 3 4 months climbs to 003 in month 5 and 006 in month 6 after it reaches 006 i only have maybe two weeks to change the filter before the water starts to smell fishy and i mean that literally like fish it starts off very subtle at first but it will get stronger and stronger i do n t know if it comes from some chemical from the filter leaching into the water or if it is from some sort of bacterial contamination in the filter but to avoid it change the filter immediately when the meter reads 006 n non fit and finish when i first got the pitcher there were a lot of rough edges in the plastic especially on the handle that was weird and slightly annoying you would think that for a premium water pitcher they would pay more attention to something like that also the push to dispense spout at the bottom of the handle is a joke you only get a trickle of water out of it youll be standing there for 5 minutes waiting for your cup to fill up or you can just pick up the pitcher and pour the water in 5 seconds needless to say i have always just used the pour spout
1;86;55;0.8935259215332249;i know that the water in my neighbourhood is not the best tasting water i decided to buy a pitcher water filter and started to do my research i came to to conclusion that zero water had the best product in the market when i received my water filter the filtered water tasted amazing but a few weeks later the water started to have an acid taste i measured it and as expected the filter was not working any more in fact it was adding this horrible taste to the water and according to the meter the faucett water and filtered water were measuring the same nthen i started to read more reviews and multiple people were complaining of the same issue ni decided to give zero water another chance maybe i had a bad filter so i marked the day i installed my new filter april 2nd by april 28th i noticed the acid flavour again i measured the water and the meter was displaying a 7 n nthis also starts when this residue starts showing on the unfiltered water section there are these little balls that start getting yellow n nregarding the usage i am the only one that uses the filtered water i use it for every day drinking and for coffee and tea i did notice that my water boiler build up residue is diminishing so i do think the filter works good n ni do agree with other reviewers less than 4 weeks of life is too short for the price of the filter also i do n t know if that acid taste in the water is dangerous or not i would prefer the water to taste back as it does from the faucett than the filter adding this strange taste at this point i am not sure if i should keep using it n ni also found a chart of gallons vs tap water tds my tap water is under 270 that should give me between 15 and 25 gallons after making the math if i use 8 cups of water per day for 26 days i may already need a new filter so it seems to be working as expected but unfortunately the life of the filter is too short
2;3;74;0.8933744892655048;i was excited about this product as a replacement for the brita pitcher i was using and was quite pleased when it first arrived and filtered as advertised i was so happy with it that i even threw out it s predecessor after testing the water output and seeing that the brita which admittedly was in need of a filter change anyway could n t come close in filtration to it the tap water at the time was reading 200 on the included meter and came out around 160 from the brita and 0 with this goodbye brita i found my new pitcher or so i thought n nless than 3 weeks later the water developed an awful almost acidic taste to it so i busted out the trusty meter they included and tested again the water from the tap was at this point reading 180 impurities and after going through this filter is spiked to over 300 i dumped out the pitcher rinsed it as well as the collection area for filtration and allowed it to filter again i did this several times assuming the problem may have been some bad water that came through the pipes and still despite going in from tap water in the 180s was coming out over 300 n nneedless to say i was none too happy a filters ability to clean the water may degrade overtime but in no way should it be making it worse than how it went in i e mailed the company inquiring as to how it is possible that their filters are making the water worse and if this was normal after such light usage less than 3 weeks from a single guy who between work and working out is n t home much especially around the holidays and the first week i filtered water through the brita before pouring it into the collector in this unit my e mail to them could have been accusatory or demanding of a refund or new replacement filters but it wasnt it was simply a request for information to ascertain whether the filter may have been defective or if this was something to be expected they never even had the decency to respond thus i have no choice really but to assume that this is indicative of the lifespan of their filters which i m not interested in paying for a new 15 filter every 2 weeks further i m so jaded i wo n t purchase a replacement filter on principal alone do yourself a favor and save your money even a brita filter after a year of use would filter better than this would after 2 weeks and im sure their customer service would at least take the time to respond as well to concerns aimed at the quality of their product
3;10;110;0.8880236841696922;this is a great filter a neat device is the tds total disolved solids meter i bought two pitchers and one did n t work electronics is my career so i determined it was battery connections that needed to be manipulated i m sure it worked prior to shipping n nthe filter is rather big as it has several stages and it will be more expensive to replace compared to a brita pitcher which is what i had been using the meter is fun to play with as you can check your tap water and compare your other water filter to this one tds is not the only thing that is important about clean water but this filter has charcoal which will remove bad tastes n nhow your water tastes can be subjective this filter will remove most minerals and sometimes highly purified water such as distilled has a flat taste i did n t find that to be the case here n none neat addition is a water tap on the front if you like to keep your pitcher in the refrigerator you do n t have to pull it out to get water water is all i drink so i used to carry two brita pitchers to my bedroom at night i have a small ice maker in the bathroom so i have iced water through the night one down side is the weight of the filled pitcher but you ca n t get highly filtered water from a multi stage filter and expect the filter to be the size of a brita filter because the large filter occupies more space the pitcher is bigger to allow for more water capacity n ni live in an area with old rusty pipes rust is such a problem that i have a full house sediment filter and under the kitchen sink i have another whole house filter with smaller particle filtration and a carbon filter this then leads to a two stage filtration system employing carbon and sediment filters i removed the kitchen sink sprayer and installed a filter tap maybe i m nuts but i then use this water to put into this pitcher i have a parrot and other birds and i just do n t like the idea of drinking rust i m already rusty and creaky so i do n t need more rust n nwith all of that and the brita filter when i wiped the inside of the water bin of the ice maker i see rust on the paper towels this is after a large volume of water over time but it still disturbs me maybe that comes with being a highly analytical engineer or a big part is when i added the whole house filter i had to remove a section of galvanized pipe and needed to replace it with pvc i looked inside of the metal pipe in place since 1971 and i was horrified by what i saw there was something black inside of the pipe i stuck my finger in and it was covered with a black goo there was so much that the inside diameter of the pipe was reduced by 50 n nperhaps you know understand my obsession with water filtration i replaced the pipe leading to the underside of the sink filtraction system but i know that when i shower some of that goo is getting on me yuck i had wondered why a black mold looking substance would form in the toilet i really need to find out what it is but i m not allowed to put in a well and i ca n t force them to replace all of their pipes unfortunately i ca n t afford to have all of mine replaced either n nwell i sure covered water filtration i recommend that everyone should have a whole house filter i plumbed mine so i can have a sediment filter and a carbon filter after that i also suggest that you do as i m about to send off a sample of your tap water to have it tested if you do put in a whole house filter or you just use this pitcher i would have the filtered water also tested out of curiosity n na final word the less filtered the water going into this pitcher the faster the filter will need replacing if you use a clear whole house filter housing highly recommended you can see what is being kept from going into your body and you can tell when to replace the filte another final word remember that filters filter water so all the water that passes through a filter goes through a filter with all this yucky stuff in it so do n t be stingy about changing filters your meter will help give you an idea when to change your filter it is a great tool and a fantastic marketing device
4;32;32;0.8828105428635022;i bought this based off the stellar reviews i should have kept on looking because after owning this for just under 2 months i am no longer happy with it n ni have owned a brita filter pitcher before and a clear2o water pitcher the brita did ok but did n t taste that great and the carbon would end up floating around in the top and sometimes in my water which i did n t like the clear2o worked great for me but i did n t like how it hooked up directly to the faucet i could handle it but my girlfriend hated it when we moved to a new place the current kitchen sink would n t hook up to it so it was time to search for a new pitcher n ni had heard good things about the zerowater with the exception of the costly filters but decided to give it a try n nfirst impressions were that it was very slow to filter compared to the brita or clear2o however i liked the taste of the water and it was something i could live it the tds meter was a nice gimmick my tap water was about 120ppm and after the filter it was down to zero so that was good n nit s only me and her using it and her 2 cats for their water dish and after about 2 weeks i noticed that sometimes the water would just stop filtering it would just hang out on top until i bumped it just right and then it would continue to filter it was around 4 weeks when i noticed little orange spheres in the top similar to the black carbon i d seen in my brita but i washed those out and thought nothing of it still reading 0ppm on the tds so it s still working n nabout 2 weeks ago my girlfriend said the water tasted funny and there were more orange things in the top of the filter again i checked the tds and now it was 1ppm well it had taken 1 5 months to get to 1ppm so i surely had some life left last week i checked again still at 1ppm n ntoday the water tasted really funny out of the pitcher when it s cold it was n t too noticeable just a slightly sour taste to the water again more orange stuff in the top i tested the tds this time and it jumped to 82ppm in the past week that was crazy as the water warmed up the taste just grew worse and worse until the tap water actually tasted better than the filtered water n nat this time i went back to amazon in search of a new filter thinking it had been two months and was probably due for a replacement that s when i looked at reviews for the filters apparently around 2013 or so they changed filter styles which decreased how long the filters lasted and many people have problems with the same orange things floating in the top of the pitcher there s a ton of bad reviews in there but the old amazing reviews are keeping them out of sight so someone like me did n t really notice them at all n ni placed an order for a new filter but immediately cancelled it i m trying another pitcher this time from a different brand mavea and hopefully that will be better otherwise it s back to the drawing board
5;82;47;0.8763732077529199;my experience with zerowater filtration system has been confusing and frustrating n ni purchased a zerowater zp 010 10 cup pitcher from amazon on may 13th since i setup the system and began using it on june 1st i ve gone through a total of two zero water filters making the average lifespan of a filter 1 month long n nthe first filter that came with the device managed to read near zero on the tds water testing system compared to my brita system that was in the range of 98 i was impressed and thought the water tasted great n nafter approximately a month went by the flavorless ness of the water was replaced by a sour citric taste in the water this made the water unpalatable and made my wife and me very confused as to the cause of such a distortion we replaced the water filter thinking that it was the cause and it turned out to be the case n nour second water filter has now done something very similar except now our water tastes sour as opposed to citric y as before n ni ve read through the website s faq i ve cleaned the system i believe i ve installed everything correctly but what i m most confused about is how this filter can last only one month and why the water tastes so strange the water that is filtered through zerowater tastes worse than unfiltered tap water n nin addition to how quickly the filters have turned over the pitcher s functionality is abysmal you might expect this pitcher to pour water into a standard size drinking container without splashing liquid on your floor but that s not the case the simplest of pourings always cause water to leak out where it s not expected and miss the intended target the same is true for the pinch and release mechanism on the back it produces a wide and wild spread that makes a mess we can not pour water from this device anywhere other than over the sink
6;8;41;0.84036472495689;review update bought on november nov 19 today is jan 31 when the filter turns bad the water stinks like rotting fish we could not figure out the source at first then we discovered its the boiling water so we back tracked the tap water nope then the seychelles water nope then the zerowater yup after 2 months of use the filter died my wife son and i used this water for two days yuck n nwe used the test meter and it still showed the filter is fine but the water still smells like dead fish go on youtube and search on zerowater smell and see the video on zerowater filtration system water dispenser why does my water smell like fish and there i found my answer in fact by googling it you find out that many have this problem i will call the company tomorrow i am so dissapointed the water is great up till two days ago this is way way way too dangerous if they ca n t resolve this n ni purchased this because of a product comparison report at natural news dot com i like the tester that comes with this product but i do not like the lid it is difficult to put the lid back on they need to do a redesign of that aspect of the product but the filter is superb i use seychelles for taking out the radiation particals and use this to take out all the other stuff thanks to what went on in fukushima california s water has gone up a few rads n nso if you are looking for the best picture filter system mike adams report and lab study proves this filter the only counter top filtration system that is better would be a big berkey if you have 350 to spend on it we also use berkey shower filters too so we take researching these water filter systems pretty seriously
7;94;101;0.8090479071144486;i ve tried all of the other brands known by most and sold in stores and this one is by far the best the water is left with no taste at all which is how it should be honestly i do n t even use the little tester half the time because i can tell just by the taste of the water when the filter needs to be replaced before i bought this i thought the tap water tasted alright i live in an area where it is actually pretty clean but now it clearly smells like lake water to me and has a very distinct and noticeable taste my only gripe is the cost of the filters since i workout a lot i drink a lot of water and they only last 2 3 weeks but i mean i drink a lot of water they last 1 2 weeks longer for my friend
8;48;11;0.8029797330473036;put in a brand new filter in the pitcher early evening yesterday filled up the water and it sat in the reservoir all night it was still filled to the top when i checked it 11am this happens too many times and it is a real pain i beat the filter on the counter and still clogged if i read this in a review i would have brought a different product n nup date on filter had to throw out a brand new filter would not work for 2 days of banging and letting sit water still in reservoir open a new filter and there was water inside the bag now what is water doing inside of a seal bag these filters are too expensive to be throwing out when they are brand new plus i have to travel to buy these filter going to get rid of this brand and buy a different brand enough is enough nps yes i have both dispensers will get rid of both the theory is you fill up the smaller one then pour that into the bigger one to make the filter last longer when the bigger dispenser reads 006 you that that filter and put it into the smaller one
9;64;21;0.7993819834129445;i m certain most users feel this way but i figured i ll add my review anyway the pitcher is terrible it s frustrating that for such a great filter they designed a below par pitcher most other companies got that part right why not just fix it to have the perfect product the filters last me only a couple of weeks so it s very pricy but no other filtration system has come close to this quality of water so i will stick with it until that is someone comes up with a much better design and comparable filter the lid spout does not pour well and leaks all over when poured the button is hard to press and should just be a simple pull up toggle instead also since i leave it out on the counter the bright blue is so unsightly it should really be a neutral color that appeals to everyone i did contact the company to see if they have any plans of re designing i tried the aquagear water filter recently and was convinced that i will switch but the taste was just off although the pitcher was much better so i am back to zerowater and hope they come out with a new version soon
10;9;10;0.7885516599561229;some have complained their filters do not last long enough i believe i have a solution n nwhen i was a teenager with nothing else to do i went to the public swimming pool every day in my boredom i decided on an experiment i showered after the pool but did not wash my hair i discovered the chlorine left a thick gummy residue making it nearly impossible to comb my hair with that in mind we fill our water filters with water from two pitchers we leave sitting out uncovered at least 8 hours this allows the chlorine in the water to evaporate before going through the filter result we bought our zero water pitcher in mid april 2017 our tap water reads 050 our filtered water still reads 000 today is june 25th n ni will update this review whenever our filter finally needs replacing meanwhile i m requesting other owners to try my experiment and reply to this review when you have determined if evaporating the chlorine before filling your filter pitcher makes a difference in how long your filters last thanks n nto respond to other complaints n1 the filter leaks my wife installed the filter it leaked i tightened it per the instructions and it stopped leaking if your filter leaks you did n t tighten it properly n n2 the water takes forever to go through the filter i noticed the top of the filter was blocked by air bubbles i used a little thin plastic spoon to gently chase the bubbles around and make them pop through the membrane i was very careful not to damage the membrane the water then drained through the filter properly n n3 the carbon filter stuff is getting into the top chamber so what that s pre filter it is not pretty but it does not matter you do n t have a problem unless you have pieces of filter in the bottom chamber ignore it n nwe also bought the larger tank for the fridge a full zerowater pitcher perfectly fills the upper chamber on the tank we are using the recommendations of another reviewer who runs the water through the smaller pitcher to fill the larger tank this extends the life of the filters when the filter in the tank needs replacing he moves it to the pitcher that performs a pre filtering for the newer filter in the tank extending the life of the tank filter great idea with that said do not misunderstand our pitcher filter has been used the most since we drink from it as well as from the tank and we use it to fill the tank and yet it is still reading 000 n nsince you have read this far you win a free magic trick we are big fans of the carbonaro effect and i figured out a carbonaro style trick with our fridge tank when you are going to have company over fill the tank to the top and when the lower chamber is full fill the upper chamber to the top too and put in the fridge when setting the table for dinner ask aunt gullible to fill the water glasses as she is doing so explain how the filter fills itself by extracting the moisture from the air in the fridge and how this helps prevent mold growth in the fridge after dinner remind aunt gullible to check the filter to see if it is full yet she knows nobody has gone near the fridge and will be astonished to see the filter is full again or at least refilled substantially
11;6;49;0.7615691412653061;i have various concerns with this pitcher n nfirst the filter lasted only four yes 4 days with 2 adults 1 dog and 2 cats we do have very hard well water but still no way is this an affordable option by day four the water had an awful sour taste and gave me heartburn the tds reading was 10 at this point our well water tested over 400 but never gave me heartburn this makes me wonder what is in this filter n nsecond as i have further researched water quality it appears that tds total dissolved solids relates more to aesthetic qualities taste smell etc and actually indicates very little about overall quality and other contaminants zerowater s marketing is deceiving suggesting that zero tds is healthy and recommended by the fda i could find no such recommendation by the fda but did find their regulations for bottled water which can not exceed 500 tds the zerowater website also states that 500 tds is the maximum allowed by the epa however this article http water epa gov drink contaminants secondarystandards cfm on the epa s website seems to contradict that stating that tds is a secondary non mandatory drinking water regulation nowhere does the zerowater website explicitly address the epa s primary i e mandatory drinking water regulations the zerowater website does have a chart of various pesticides and other contaminants that are apparently mostly filtered out but the emphasis on tds and deceptive marketing makes me skeptical n nthe more i have read the more i question the safety and efficacy of this filter that combined with the short life and expense of the filters leaves me less than impressed i am returning the pitcher for a partial refund there is return shipping fee of 8 50 i can not recommend this product
12;29;73;0.7507649021354065;we ordered this unit to get good tasting clean water i measured our tap water and it registered over 500 on the meter supplied by zerowater with the unit the first couple of days that we used this unit the water tasted good and it registered 000 on the meter after going through the zerowater filter less than twelve days later and the water was tasting so foul that we could not drink it i tested the water with the meter and it registered under 20 but was so bad tasting that it was undrinkable prior to getting the zerowater unit we had been buying our water from a local water store that registered a mere 002 on the meter that was supplied with the zerowater unit and only cost us 25 cents a gallon we do not drink that much water and i estimate that we put about 15 gallons of water through the unit in the less than 2 weeks that we were able to drink the water considering that replacement filters run about 17 each that means that water through this unit was costing us over a dollar a gallon nneedless to say we are scrapping the zerowater and going back to a water cooler and bottled water at just 25 cents a gallon our last water cooler unit lasted well over ten years everything considered the water cooler route is less expensive and tastes a whole lot better
13;21;20;0.7208398793382843;purchased this after much research was concerned about the chromium 6 in our water and it was the only filtered pitcher that removes it was concerned about the negative comments but thought we d give it a try well at first it was fine but after only 3 weeks there is a metallic taste to the water the reading is still only 0 so it is really strange it is undrinkable starting feeling sick a week ago now after reading many of the comments i see it is related to the water from this pitcher i will not get another filter i believe it is the filter that is making the water taste like that do yourself a favor do not buy this zerowater pitcher if you google acidic metallic taste from zerowater pitchers you will see many more negative results wish i had done that first before purchasing it
14;28;13;0.6754955895153603;i ve owned this one as well as the 8 cup version zerowater tastes better than brita by far and the filter lasts for longer than advertised if you re drawing water from a good quality municipal source n nhowever the achilles heel in both cases was the spout which in principle is a good idea on the 8 cup version the flow rate was frustratingly slow making me eventually give up on using the feature on this one the flow rate was more acceptable but still too slow if the water level is low after a little less than two years of use the spout button popped out due to a broken plastic piece the spout failed open so the pitcher is now unusable even just to pour
15;50;5;0.6498343810904657;so far a five the only thing that keeps it from a five and a half is how slow it filters takes about 5 minutes about 3 minutes to long to my liking nmy water through a brita filter reads 209 zero filtered its 0 but i just got it brita and pur do not take out chlorine or fluoride or lead 10 12 17 i want to see how long a filter lasts some say only a few weeks in which case i ll be p d nupdated nat my drinking water use which is low 15 gallons a month and my pre filtration readings 209 i can expect to use a filter every 8 weeks thats high i can buy distilled water at the same cost the difference is i do n t have to carry all that water home and i do n t use all that plastic however 15 mo is a bit disappointing so 4 stars nupdated nwell the filter lasts me 8 weeks also i can taste the water even at zero you can see an explanation on line who cares it slightly tart 3 stars nupdated after two months nput in the replacenent filter the water reads 56 i cant return it i have it 2 months im not buying more to see if this is a defective one at 15 a filter
16;42;8;0.6048719849374803;do n t buy this after less than a month of use the water in the pitcher either smells like rotting fish or gets super acidic and tastes like lemon i have changed the filter multiple times and it keeps happening with each new filter i have no idea what causes the smell or taste but it ca n t be good going back to a brita filter instead

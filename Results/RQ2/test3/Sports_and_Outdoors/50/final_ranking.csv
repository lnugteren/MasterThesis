0;3;28;0.8837005789636894;let me start this off with my conclusion the valeo ab wheel is fantastic and a great value for the paltry amount of money you will spend on it n ni ve been eating well and exercising light weights a couple sets of pull ups chin ups and resistance cables five to ten minutes a day along with 1 1 5 hours of cardio once or twice a week but wanted a little more strength and definition in my core i started doing sit ups once or twice a day 50 100 at a time which felt pretty good but i was worried about not working all of my abs equally i was also curious as to other methods because my back or shoulders seem to click when i do full sit ups additionally it was hard to anchor myself unless i put my feet under the bottom edge of the couch which involved putting shoes on due to the sharp wooden frame all in all it was a bit of a production just to do some sit ups n ni found the valeo ab wheel on amazon and ordered it based on the other reviews and the fact that it seemed such a simple solution compared to my sit up crunches ritual it is a pleasure to use but make sure that you read the instructions on proper use so that you do not hurt your back keep it straight through the whole repetition i recommend using the ab wheel on carpet for the added friction it helps you control how far you extend yourself and prevent self injury but it will operate smoothly on a solid floor i keep the wheel right next to my bed so that one of the first things i do when i get up other than kill the alarm is to do a set i start my coffee have a banana and then do another set when i come back into the bedroom to get my clothes before showering if i m feeling particularly adventurous that day i ll do a third set of 15 in the evening before dinner n nthe first time i used it i was able to do two sets of 15 a couple minutes apart but my abs were sore afterwards the awesome kind of sore that lets you know you ve had a good workout before i used it the first time i was pretty sure i d be able to do a good number because i ve practiced martial arts which is all about core strength for 15 years do not be discouraged if at first you can only do a couple at a time i could only do two or three proper pull ups or chin ups on a chin up bar when i started a year ago i added one or two more reps to each set every couple weeks now i am up doing two to three sets of 14 20 pull ups or chin ups every few days just from casual consistency you can do the same with the valeo ab wheel n nafter using the ab wheel for a little over a month i now comfortably do 2 3 sets of 15 every day giving the muscles a day to rest and heal if they start to get sore this ab wheel is well constructed and sturdy for someone who is 5 6 and 145lbs like me and it does give your back and arms triceps and forearms a little bit of a workout too n nin six weeks of ownership and regular use i have seen results in terms of better abdominal definition my girlfriend compliments me constantly putting her hands on my chest just to touch which is pretty awesome considering she is also in great shape in her words i now have abs that are sculpted like on a greek statue to be honest i have n t worked that hard at being in good shape i ve simply been consistent and made it a lifestyle change eating well a good amount of protein and healthy fats from nuts eggs fish chicken and oils walnut and grapeseed oils taste great and have omega 3s to keep your brain in good order along with salads coarse grains a variety of fruit and green vegetables a limited amount of red meat sweets and bread baked products and lots of water tea and coffee black or with a small amount of soy creamer along with decent sleep is probably two thirds of it n ni ve found that the process of simply learning about how healthy all of these things are for your mind and body and how bad trans fats and junk fast frozen prepared food is for it goes a long way in causing your body and mind to literally crave the things that are most healthy for you i see ice cream steak chips or cake at a party and sure i ll have a little but you know you re in a good place when you are at home and actually crave carrots broccoli and low fat hummus walnuts and an apple eating these things feels good because you know how good they are for you it seems to be about conditioning your mind and body to desire these things through the education of both n nthe last bit of it has been working out in the privacy of my own apartment about 5 10 minutes every day and at the dojo for an hour or so a couple times a week then going for walks for photography grocery runs or just to get out and enjoy the good weather i was bicycling 13 miles on a flat urban trail near my place 2 3 times a week which took me about 50 minutes total but i have n t done that since last summer i ll start up again now that the weather is good but it has n t been part of my routine for months i have lost about 25lbs in one year more than that if you count conversion of fat to muscle and i ve gone from being in ok shape with a few extra pounds to being super proud of how i look i m not ripped just really toned and with a healthy and sustainable amount of muscle in the right places like a perfect male model for sketching according to the artistic girlfriend n nnow i regularly get compliments from friends clients and strangers something i am totally unused to i ve never thought of myself as hot or especially attractive but apparently i ve been seeing myself incorrectly for some time now these days i dress nicer and i am not afraid to wear more flattering clothes i am so much more confident in myself personally professionally and physically it has really helped me become more outgoing and willing to try new things and meet new people simply for the sake of meeting new people n ni m not going to claim that the ab wheel is responsible for all of this i ve only had it a little over a month however in my short time with it it has proven to be yet another useful effective and affordable tool in becoming who i want to be it has become and will continue to be a regular part of my workout i wanted to share my experience with all of you and hopefully my story will help along with the valeo ab wheel inspire you to become the healthy and happy person i know you can be there is no reason why you should not buy this product save for already owning one you owe it to yourself and the value you will get out of this directly and indirectly immeasurably exceeds the 15 you ll pay for it n nmatt
1;49;34;0.8508102676365155;first i read the review complaining about the grip and difficult assembly and have to say they are blatantly wrong n nthe grip is perfect unless you have massive or extremely petite hands otherwise you are golden it is plastic however it is not slick even when your hands perspire the grip remains non slip n nassembly has a breeze two wheels two grips and one sturdy metal rod axel place the wheels on together and slide the grips on to cap both ends of the rod that s it n nto keep this process simple and easy there are tiny holds on the ends of each grip which allows air to escape so that they slide on with minimal force i e if you have trouble putting this product together you are not going to be able to perform the workout this item provides n nseriously i ve had more difficulty opening 2 liter bottles of soda than were presented by assembly n nthe workout provided by the wheel is ridiculous but amazing 220 and 12 body fat i thought i would do ok when starting out as i have never worked out with this apparatus before but i immediately felt the workout and was sore within 10 15 minutes n nthe motion does take a little time to perfect and it is in your best interest to read directions and take your time to get used to it and believe me you will not be able to just take it out of the box and do 20 reps anyway this thing is a serious workout n ni considered myself to have a pretty darn strong core but after my first time i was shocked to feel how much work i had to do this is clearly a device intended for those who are already at a tremendous level of fitness n nhowever if you are able to overcome the initial difficulties and embrace the challenge of this piece of equipment over time you will find no better way to strengthen your core which is the best way to jump start a better overall fitness and more importantly feel better about yourself and all future workout endeavors n nbuy this item keep your chin up and stick it out once you see how challenging it is and you will reap serious benefits n nanyone who gave negative reviews were presumably unable to get over that hump and like most people blame everyone and everything but themselves n nas someone who is in the midst of a 100lbs weight loss i ve learned that diet and exercise begins and ends with discipline some people have it some people do n t if you know you have it get this thing work your butt off and feel great as a result if you are the type looking for an easy solution or think this is just another in a long line of crappy fads you ll be sorely disappointed n nthis thing is awesome
2;42;27;0.7749097089719869;i ve been using it for a couple weeks now and i m happy i got it the wheels are sturdy and the whole thing feels pretty solid and stable even when i have my weight on it it rolls nice and smooth i did n t have any trouble getting the grips on as others have described they went on pretty easy and they stay on pretty well the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the grips are not as comfortable as they could be the first time i used it i put my lifting gloves back on after a few reps with the gloves on its perfectly fine but it might be an issue if you do n t lift with gloves n nnow ab wheels in general are a great core exercise you can really feel it and it will give you a six pack if you use it consistently the catch is that it s a difficult exercise to perform if you work out on a regular basis at least 2 3 times per week i would say give it a shot concentrate on good form plenty of explanatory videos online and do n t overdo it if you are just starting out i would suggest concentrating on doing other abdominal exercises first my suggestion would be to create an ab routine that takes 10 15 minutes to complete and do it 4 times per week once you build up a base level of core strength you can graduate to the ab wheel
3;40;36;0.7374219064898841;i am actually one of the many people that advocate hardwork opposed to shortcut methods but i am also open minded to newer techniques that give more optimum workout n nany ab workout item that actually works is rare and one that works at this price range is nothing short of a miracle this thing actually works feels like doing pullups and crunches at the same time without as much effort i do over 100 situps plus other gym ab workouts and just a few rolls on this baby i can already feel the burns and in areas i never knew i had it got my whole upper body sore the next morning with just a few rolls amazing stuff n na couple things i should mention the first time i could barely do 5 of these but now i can do 25 with no problem something this product made me realize is how weak my wrists were it worked out my whole arm including the wrist which was a major plus the handle could be softer it is plastic so it will take time to get used to n nhandles my weight which is 185 lb i ll update this review later if needed
4;17;35;0.7335063826421081;at first i thought how can this work you just zip back and forth with ease well therein lies the problem if you are just zipping back and forth on it you are not using it right and you will not have the results that it can actually give n nmy hubby is 6 4 and in great shape exercises regularly lifts weights etc he benches 200 300 lbs he did not expect this little wheel to be so much work for him he is by no means a weakling but this ab wheel definitely takes some strength to use properly he loves it though he can feel the burn after just a few tries and keeps using it daily getting a few more in each day n nwhen he showed me how to use it i was like this is cake i m just rolling back and forth and it took no strength and i felt no difficulty i was n t using the proper form and muscles once he got me to do it right boy was there a major difference i can see and feel how this thing works when used properly doing it right is essential if you are just rolling back and forth then you are not doing it right and you will not see any results n nit seems sturdy enough and the grips are pretty comfortable n nthis little device is definitely worth trying but remember to make sure you are doing it the right way
5;19;8;0.6667377268777078;it s a wheel with a stick in the middle and handles to grip nothing complicated about the device and there is n t anything in particular that s needed from such a device n ni did notice the price recently was 16 and higher and if it is that price when you re thinking of buying it there are cheaper options out there or you can wait for the price to go back down i bought it for about 9 10 from here and that s reasonable for such a device like i mentioned above it is a highly simplistic device and paying over 10 for it seems unnecessary n nreminder if you have weak or injured wrists then you may not want to jump up to this device yet as you will be supporting your weight the entire time and your wrists will not be happy if they have a pre existing condition or are not ready for it example if being in the high plank push up position hurts your wrists then using this device properly will make them even less happy listen to your body and train smart
6;6;12;0.6274356288299239;you would think it would be a simple enough thing to assemble this thing be careful you have to remove a bar end cover to thread the wheels through well the raw metal ends of the bar are incredibley unfinished and sharper than a razer when threading the 2 wheels together through the holes the bar slipped through hitting the palm of my hand and removed a large chunk of skin it hurt like you would not believe and after 5 hours was still bleeding finally this morning it stopped bleeding nnow my father s day has been ruined because of cheeply made crap this is a total piece of garbage and should not be sold on amazon or anywhere for that matter
7;23;19;0.6051695829727983;the handle smells like human waste and after use that smell transfers to your hands which does not wash off right away i have tried everything i can think of to treat it from soap to bleach the stink just does not go away it is a great price for the product and it does seem to work but the smell makes it unusable
8;39;24;0.601211276753396;this is really all anyone needs to get a tremendous core workout doing wheel rollouts the valeo is no brainer constructed so i expect it ll last a long time i had a single wheel version once and it was n t as stable or comfortable as this i ca n t see needing or wanting anything fancier and overpriced n nonly thing to be aware of is you should work on a hard durable surface do n t work out directly on a hardwood floor etc you are putting most of your bodyweight on a wheel with a contact area of about an inch so the tread pattern may leave marks on a sensitive surface if nothing else buy a 1x or 2x12 long hard wood board and lay it down on your floor and do rollouts on that thin secure carpeting is also good
9;20;17;0.5917133190616338;the ab wheel works fine but i hate the smell of it you can expect a little odor with many vinyl and plastic products this product has a really bad odor and the problem gets worse when i use it because the smell transfers from the handle to my hands washing your hands does not completely eliminate the odor there are plenty of other similiar products available i regret purchasing this ab wheel
10;7;9;0.5868687668784448;i ordered this ab wheel to add to my daily rotation of exercises i have been using this product twice a day for the last 4 months n npros n durability even after extensive use there is no structural or aesthetic damage to the ab wheel n function it was easy to assemble and rolls smoothly day in and day out n ncons n comfort after using the product for a week my hands developed small blisters that i am guessing are from the hand grips they are plastic and can cause discomfort with extended use i simply wrapped the hand grips in some tape and have not had any issues since n noverall ni am extremely pleased with this product especially given the relatively low price point it has lasted daily use for 4 months with no signs of breaking anytime soon i could not have been happier with this purchase

0;47;46;0.9342603923876895;i used the jawbone up for two months before it finally died over the period of a week when i purchased the up the question in my mind was whether it was just the latest craze or if it is worth the price i have a garmin watch which tracks my activities far more accurately than the up other aps which are far less costly can track what you eat so the real motivation for my purchase was to track my everyday activity when i am not purposefully working out and my sleep and here is the strength of the up band while i believe that its tracking of both activity and sleep may not be very accurate at times the power of using it is that any sort of tracking encourages you to meet the goals for activity and sleep that you set i always wondered why i was so tired during the day until up showed me that i was n t getting as much sleep as i thought i simply was n t going to bed right away even though in my mind i was n t delaying getting into bed and i found myself walking more during the day to make the 10 000 step goal that i had set n nhowever i do wish that jawbone would elaborate about how sleep and activities are tracked so that i can better understand what it is tracking as a person who purchased the up as a means to better understand myself i find jawbone s explanation that advanced algorithms are used to be condescending like telling a child that something is too complicated for them to understand n ntechnical problems n nabout 6 weeks after i started using the up band i started having problems it started with waking up in the morning and pressing the button on the band to take it out of sleep mode only to find the band completely dead even though it had a 30 charge the night before i charged it fully but this happened again the next night following the guide on the jawbone website i did a soft reset and then a hard reset that seemed to work for a few days but then the up began to loose activity during the day nothing was recorded then there with problems with the up being dead in the morning i contacted jawbone technical support and after a two rounds of correspondence over the course of a few days they told me to return the band to them n ncustomer support n nmy correspondence with jawbone technical support was good once my up band began to fail but several days would pass between when i sent my email and when they responded however they were quick to ask me to return the band for a replacement which i thought was very good n ncomfort n ni first purchased a medium size band based on the fitting guide which was on the jawbone website at the time when it arrived i found that the medium fit too snugly causing the ends of the band to extend up from my wrist rather than being flush so i ordered the large which was too big it is always slipping down on my wrist constricting my movement and causing soreness or bouncing around which is annoying i wish that jawbone had designed the band better so with articulated ends which could be closed around your wrist for a customized fit instead of assuming that everyone could be comfortable with one of three sizes n ni recommend ordering two bands if you are in between sizes so that you can try the fit of both and then return the one that is less uncomfortable n nbattery n njawbone indicates that the battery should last about 10 days i usually find that i need to charge the up band after about 6 days i suspect that it really depends on whether or not you have set up alerts which cause the band to vibrate using power charging the band is easy and usually takes about an hour however you cant charge the band at night since it needs to be plugged in i usually charge it when i am at working at my desk n nandroid application n ni was excited to hear that jawbone had finally developed an ap for android however i was very disappointed by the ap once i tried it i installed the ap from the play store and within 90 minutes my phone s battery had been drained significantly my phone never goes down in battery life that quickly i checked the battery meter and it was the up ap that had used the battery power i uninstalled the ap and the battery drain stopped n ni emailed jawbone to tell them my experience i received a response a few days later which read that the ap shouldnt do that and that i might want to check with my phone s manufacturer which is complete rubbish since all of my other aps run smoothly and it was clearly the up ap which caused the battery drain problem n nsynching n nmy routine is to wake up and plug the up into my ipod to see how i slept i also synched when i got home from work and when i go to bed i found it was easy to get into the habit of switching between modes or synching n nsleep monitoring n ni do n t know how the up determines when you are in deep sleep as opposed to light sleep the website just says that they use advanced algorithms to make the calculations for me it would be more helpful to understand how the determination is made so that i can better understand my sleep which is part of the reason why i purchased the up n nin one instance i received a telephone call about 30 minutes after i went to bed i got out of bed to answer the phone had a brief conversation and returned to bed agitated however the up showed no indication that i was up and instead showed me sleeping i have the phone record so i know it was n t a dream so i find it odd that the up did n t pick it up especially since i walked around before getting back to bed n ni have found that if you hit the snooze button or if you take a short nap the up band will not record that short nap as sleep i do n t know what the threshold is to get the up band to actually recognize that you are sleeping but it seems to be that you must be sleeping longer than 20 minutes n nactivity monitoring n nthe first time that i wore the up i hopped on my bike and rode on trails for 1 1 2 hours which included a steep uphill climb the up showed it as being 7000 steps the up is n t like a gps watch to keep track of distance nor does it have any way to measure cadence so i wonder how it calculated the steps again the secret is the advanced algorithms n ntoday for example i went for a quick 36 minute run which i tracked using my garmin watch however up shows that my longest activity today was only 23 minutes i could understand if up did n t get an accurate indication of my bike rides but to miss active time when i was running n ni wish that you could import exercise data without having to enter it manually i use a garmin watch to keep track of my exercise and the garmin website can output data files of my activity it would have been nice to be able to import the data into the up application so that i can keep all of my data in one place on the up n nactivity alarms n nyou can set activity alarms so that the up vibrates if you sit in one place for too long however it seems that the up requires a certain number of steps or else it will tell you that you should be moving for example i will be on my feet at work and moving back and forth between desks in another case i will get up from my desk to go to the kitchen down the hall and on the way back the up will vibrate i appreciate the reminders to move but i do find the alerts to be annoying when they occur when i am moving n napplication n nthere are tips on each day during my second week of use i got a tip that i did n t sleep deeply enough and that i should consider exercising more seeing as i exceed 10 000 steps a day usually by 10 000 steps including an hour running or biking each day with more on weekends i found this tip to be really annoying it is as if the programmers set up to look at one statistic without regard for others i bought up to look at the whole picture that up doesnt is a real failure in my opinion n ndiet n nit is possible to record what you eat during the day one option is to scan barcodes however as someone who makes most of my own food including bread and pasta from scratch it is difficult for me to figure out the nutritional values that the ap asks me for so this feature is much more readily useful for someone that eats out in places where others have already eaten and entered the nutritional information or someone who eats a lot of microwave dinners so overall this feature was a real disappointment for me n nsummary n noverall a powerful tool for tracking and therefore improving your daily activity and sleep however do n t expect a lot from the other functions of the up ap such as tracking your nutritional intake my first up band had technical problems and had to be returned but i still plan to purchase a replacement
1;92;91;0.9198281385313742;i have been wearing my up since before christmas and have had to charge it just 2x during those 19 days n nthe up s performance has been flawless so far n nthe band is lightweight and unobtrusive after a couple of days you do n t even notice you are wearing it any more n ni do take it off prior to showering although it is waterproof no one needs to monitor his her steps in the shower or bath and i figure that constant contact with water and soap shampoo will eventually degrade any device s appearance it takes a second to remove it and second to put it back on so i do not consider this an inconvenience n nlike most other shoppers i considered the fitbit one as well but several factors weighed heavily in favor of the up in my mind n ni love that the up is on me at all times and i do n t have to fiddle with a clip or a wristband or other accessories to use it i already have a lot of gadgets and devices that need special accessories the last thing i want is one more being required to wear a large wristband to strap the fitbit on every night was a dealbreaker for me n ni also love that the up does not require bluetooth to sync many reviews complain bitterly that this is a fault or an omission i see it as a feature n ndo i really want to be tempted to obsessively check real time stats as they come in nope n ndo i want to have to leave power sucking bluetooth turned on all the time on my phone definitely not n nis it super simple and easy to just plug the up into the headphone port whenever you feel like doing a sync you bet n nless is more in this case n ngiven its small form factor and light weight i find the up s performance pretty remarkable n nthe ios app is intuitive colorful and appealing and the ability to add teammates is a fantastic motivational feature especially if your friends are more active than you are n ni do however hope that jawbone will add the ability to track your data via its www site in the future as well as improve the ability to download import your data into other fitness apps n nupdate april 2013 n nafter four months of use i continue to appreciate the up s form factor and functionality my original band developed a fault after a couple of months a strange clunking noise as if something were moving inside the band and jawbone replaced it n njawbone s customer service was speedy and efficient although it did involve an enormous avalanche of emails from different departments i promptly received a replacement band in generic non retail packaging and was given a prepaid label to ship the faulty band back n nthe replacement has been working fine while disappointed to have experienced a flaw like that so early in the band s life i am still happy with the up and was impressed by jawbone s support n nanother update july 2013 n nafter three months of use my replacement band bit the dust n nwhile washing the car i inadvertently splashed the band lightly once as soon as i noticed it had gotten a little bit of moisture on it i took it off and put it inside the house n nthree hours later the band was completely non functional and unresponsive not impressive for a product that is supposedly ok to wear in the shower or when swimming n nonce again jawbone was prompt to provide a replacement which is working well so far n nhowever my confidence in the up is pretty much gone n nit is great that jawbone will replace them so quickly whenever there is a problem but owners must realize that that largesse will disappear as soon as the original warranty period expires at that point the repair costs will likely be prohibitive and many disappointed owners will likely opt to ditch a faulty out of warranty band or jump ship to fitbit rather than shovel out even more money into supporting this faulty design n ni m deducting two stars from my rating to reflect the abbreviated lifespan of the band sorry jawbone i wanted to believe you had addressed your quality issues but you haven t n nanother update may 2014 n nafter nine months of using the latest replacement band my up had lost its vibrating function sync had become problematic working once out of every three attempts or so and the rubber casing on the band had started to work itself loose on the end that jacks into the iphone n nwhen i wrote jawbone about it they immediately offered to send a replacement and asked for my shipping address n nafter i provided it another customer service rep wrote to revoke that offer without explanation n nmy friends with up bands have experienced similar reliability issues no up band seems to last for more than 10 months if the user is lucky n nfor the record i do not shower or swim with my band and treat it gently n nneedless to say i will not be purchasing another jawbone product especially after the company reneged on its offer to send a replacement yes after one rep said a replacement is on its way another one intervened to cancel the replacement ultimately another rep reinstated the replacement after i complained but that does n t make me feel any better about the product or the company at this point n ni am deducting another two stars from my review leaving it with just one star which seems generous for a 130 product that ca n t perform its advertised functions for more than a couple of months at a time n nfinal update august 2015 n nwell the latest replacement has failed too after very light and minimal use the rubber sleeve has become detached from the unit underneath it the band will not sync and the status lights blink in unison soft and hard resets do nothing contacting jawbone yields an email citing unusual volume of customer service requests but promises someone will get back to me in 2 3 days seems like i am not the only one dealing with their products substandard design and construction n ni would revise this to a zero star review were that possible do yourself a favor and avoid jawbone fitness trackers
2;36;35;0.9013842043534258;edited review since my first review earlier in the year i have to downgrade this device to two stars like many others my up band has officially died before it was even a year old i never took my up in the shower or swimming but after about 1 month of sitting in a drawer when i took a break from using it due to my travel needs i noticed a significant build up of rust around the headphone charging jack and inside the endcap the band stopped working correctly and would no longer take a hard or soft reset and only the red sun would light up on the band jawbone is sending me a warranty replacement so we will see how long this one lasts sadly they have not figured out how to really make a fitness product that can hold up to regular daily use n noriginal review n ni ve been using the up for about one month now overall it is a solid product and mechanically does what it says it will do quite well after calibration it records my steps very accurately checked against a digital pedometer and known distance the sleep tracking feature is great and i love the smart alarm designed to wake you within 30 min of your set time while you are in light sleep the inactivity alarm is really nice too i am getting a consistent 7 to 8 days of charge time out of it with daily smart alarm and inactivity alarms and occasional stopwatch use and i use it to the point that it tells me it has about one day of power left n nthe reason why i give this three stars is the iphone app interface once you get over how pretty it is you start to see its problems that jawbone could have tackled prior to bringing this back to market here are a few n n in many of the graphs there is no y axis so it is hard to see the total trend in the data and you have to manually click on bars to see what values are what and at other times you can only see the most current data numbers for the current day and have to guess at what the other days are exactly luckily you can download your data from the jawbone website as a csv file for export into excel however jawbone does n t make it easy or intuitive you have to dig into the user forums to figure this stuff out n n food logging is incredibly hokey and cumbersome trust me download myfitnesspro free to see what a great food diary calorie counter app with a very deep food database should look like if only jawbone had been a bit more forward thinking and developed the api to interface with other apps like this i would be elated n nif you are on the fence about this product and can wait you should hold out to see how good the fitbit flex will be it seems that it will provide more features than the up and cost less this is an emerging market and the competition is heating up so you may want to wait to see what is just a few months ahead and you may have a much better product to work with n n update jawbone has now released a new version of the iphone app early feb 2013 that provides multiple smart alarms and immediate viewing of data even when not connected to a network i can now give this four stars since these were big previous gripes for me the only down side is really the form factor the band catches very easily on sweater and coat sleeves so if you live in a cold climate where you will be wearing a lot of clothing like this it can get a bit annoying after a while and you ca n t wear this thing swimming or surfing
3;22;21;0.9006364020282078;update n nmy second jawbone up has stopped working just a little over 90 days after getting it save your money folks this product is not ready for prime time n n original review follows n ni purchased a black onyx size large jawbone up the week they became available at the time they were only available at apple stores i had been waiting for the re design as i had narrowly avoided getting the 1st iteration of the up which was ultimately plagued with major reliability issues resulting in jawbone issuing a statement that the release of that product had been an inadvertent beta program n ni have wanted a fitness tracker for a while and had looked at the fitbit nike fuelband and others before deciding that the up seemed to offer the fewest compromises for what i am after a fitness tracker that is water resistant that will track sleep habits and that i wear so that i wo n t lose it n ni got my up on release week at a local apple store i guessed at the size but the large size fits me pretty well interestingly the bracelet was initially somewhat snug but loosened up after a couple of days of regular wear setting it up with my iphone was very easy i simply downloaded the application onto my phone disconnected the cap on the up and plugged it into the headphone jack of my iphone i ran through the setup fairly quickly and was up and running n nas a pedometer the up works fairly well step counting and distance traveled is reasonably accurate although it is unfortunate that it ca n t track elevation changes such as how many stairs you have climbed or if you are climbing a mountain as a result of this you can be rapidly hiking a steep hill breathing hard and sweating a ton but since up only looks at how quickly you are covering ground it will report that you ve been undertaking a light activity ha n non the subject of activities up gives you the ability to time an activity through a key sequence with the single button on the wristband but i found the feature lacking in bright colorado sun it was impossible to see the flashing light that tells you if an activity has started and as a result on at least a couple of occasions i had not activated the timed activity mode properly instead putting the wristband into night sleep mode it would be nice if they used a brighter led or a vibration sequence for activity begin and a different one for activity end so that you could be a little more confident that it s tracking what you want n nup also gives you the ability to manually enter an activity such as aerobics weight lifting elliptical machine etc the list is pretty comprehensive but i found that the calorie counts it came up with did n t match up with what my precor reported you can slide your finger up and down on the activity to rate the difficulty of the workout and up will roughly adjust the calorie count but it would be nice to simply input the calories in the event you are using a piece of gym equipment that gives you a more precise number n nup lets you set goals for moving and sleeping and then tells you if you ve hit those goals when you sync the wristband up unfortunately it does not add the equivalent move benefit from your inputted activities so if you ve sat on your butt most of the day but then finished out the afternoon with a grueling 90 minutes on the elliptical machine up will still show that you ve not hit your move goal n nthe up does now have the ability to post your workouts or activities via twitter and facebook which is a step in the right direction originally it could not do that which was disappointing it also has a calorie tracker that you can use to input your meals but unless you know the calorie count of everything you eat or everything you eat comes from one of a select number of fast food joints or coffee shops it seems like a bit of a gimmick to me n nwhat the up does that is useful is give you a good idea of how much you ve moved around in a day so for me it s a good way to prioritize workouts if i move 10 000 12 000 steps in a day then i might feel less guilty about putting a workout off if i ve moved well under the goal value then i know i really need the extra gym time the sleep tracking is somewhat useful but i do n t know that i believe the up as at times i ve woken up and been awake for a few minutes and up never notices this it is handy for telling me how long it takes to get to sleep it would be nice to be able to export that kind of data over an entire month something you ca n t do with up today n ni had my first up for just two months when it started to act funny it was having trouble syncing and one night when i switched it in to night mode it sort of gave a feeble buzz and died it was completely dead and nothing jawbone support had me try could bring it back this was very disappointing to me as this is reminiscent of what users were reporting with the first generation product in my case although i had showered and washed my hands with the water resistant up which they say is fine i had never abused it or done anything unusual to it about the worst abuse that it got was getting snagged and twisted on a pillow or sheet when i moved around while sleeping or when slipping a jacket on n nanother thing that i had noticed with my up is that after just the two months of use the bracelet was starting to look somewhat worn out some kind of plastic film was peeling away from the band and the cap looked like it had been run over with a truck the finish was being worn away just by the sweat of my fingers removing and reseating it leaving cheap looking plastic showing through n nit took about a full 2 3 weeks for me to get my replacement up unfortunately you must mail the defective one back at your own expense sans any accessories and wait on their rma department to ship you a replacement i m still using it but i m not optimistic about the lifespan of these guys i got in just under the wire with the warranty too you d think that with the poor reputation the first revision had that jawbone would have bumped it up on these new ones especially considering the roughly 30 price bump they applied to the msrp n nconsidering the increase in msrp you d think that they would have given it a solid 1 year warranty or included a spare cap you re sure to lose the original one and they want an insane 10 for a replacement or given it bluetooth n ni m not sure if i would be happier with fitbit or fuelband either as mediocre as it is the up is still probably the best fit for me at least until someone apple develops a smart watch that has all of the functionality of the up built in obsoleting the sucker n nthe way i look at it these devices today are just scratching the surface of what is possible with biometric tracking and the next generation or two of these devices will make us glad that we had to pitch these ones in the trash can after a short time
4;104;103;0.8890338105761372;somebody said along the lines the best technology is that which gets out of the way and lets people live their lives n ni am a technologist programmer outdoor enthusiast adventurer an early adopter extremely web savvy and train those around me of emerging products with that said i think this generation has it completely backwards with their ideas of what good tech devices are however jawbone x yves behar get it right n n why this is better than a fitbit or fuelband n i like not having a screen i like not thinking i m wearing a tech gadget it looks like jewelry you already have a smartphone how many more screens do you want to carry around and worry about cracking scratching up frying darn my screen is dead n it doesnt look like an electronic device and it does n t look like it has a battery inside the fitbit looks like a pager or a bug the fuelband looks like a ridiculous prop from a 1990 s futuristic sci fi movie the up is technology more seamlessly integrated that it disappears n nno screens no fussy buttons and controls no stress of too many devices too many social media networks too many things in this culture to keep up with nthe jawbone up is invisible and let s you get back to your life before all these distractions you are in control of when you would like feedback on your information n n the bluetooth debate ninitially i was going to wait until they came out with the next version hoping they had bluetooth 3 0 but i bought it now and i actually kinda like that more i like that i have a choice in when i want to engage with the app it s like the off switch we never have for facebook twitter instagram etc that is starting to drive young adults away from these sites in a search to reclaim their lives n ndo we really want to continue living in this world where everytime there is an awkward pause in conversation people just look into their lap and pull out their phone and tune out from friends that is the wrong way to go having it sync 24 7 would mean its an ever present distraction which is another heap on the dungpile of a very distracted culture and it would make you feel like you are wearing a gadget that is part of the problem of too many messages notifications alerts vs something that gives you feedback when you want n n design n1 the bracelet itself is extremely sturdy and does n t feel cheap i own the navy blue and it looks chic i turn my cap inward so you do n t see the word jawbone it s hidden on the inside n2 packaging is minimal and easy to set up a good indicator of your coming experience with the product n3 also i love the app its so fun and user intuitive the sleep charts are amazing the vibrating smart sleep alarm clock is amazing n n4 the fatal flaw nthe cap is a nightmare i would be afraid to take the cap off in public and risk losing it as it is small and is prone to fall into cracks it also looks like a pen cap so you are not that likely to find it also the replacement for 7 or so is steep the cap should have had a rubber band that attached it to the wristband n n5 my only concern with using the headphone jack is that i m afraid the wear of shoving it in and yanking it out so much will ultimately damage and loosen the jack on my iphone and i ll have to pay for a repair i would advise instead if they go with bluetooth that you should be able to bump tap your bracelet to your smartphone for it to sync

weightlifting and cardio but over the years i have suffered knee injuries and severe ibs slowly i let my body go but now i want to get back in the game i needed some extra motivation and when i heard of this band last year i wanted to go buy it but it was recalled due to manufacturing defects now a year later jawbone has released the 2nd gen up they released it on 13th november on their website but it s shipping in december and here on amazon they are temporarily out of stock whatever that means best buy is going to get it in december so just on a hunch i stopped by my local apple store and they had two pieces in large size my size one in black and the other in pistachio green i bought the black one now one day later i definitely think it will help me i am not sure how accurate this is but i am guessing this is more accurate in telling calories you burned compared to the nike fuel band which i did get but returned it due to its weird system by measuring its own made up measure fuel points the thing i liked about the nike fuel band is you could use it as a watch for telling time as it had led lights this does not have that but this also measures your sleep quality and with the help of the ios app you can log what you are eating through out the day and your activities if you want to remain active you can set it to nudge at certain intervals of inactivity also it can wake you up at an optimum time in your sleep cycle around the time you have set the alarm for one major drawback is that you have to sync it by plugging it in your phone s audio jack jawbone is a bluetooth company and had also the 1st gen of up band to learn from so why no bluetooth there is another competitive product called lark life band available for preorder selling for 30 more which has the functionality of syncing wirelessly through bluetooth but it comes with another night band having different day and night bands did not seem feasible to me and plus it s not yet on the market i had a shower with up seems to be waterproof as the company says but let see how it holds up another thing that bugs me is the cap that you have to constantly remove so that you can sync it with your phone i hope the cap does not become loose or worse i carelessly loose it this is just an initial review i will definitely update this review after a few weeks with it hopes this helps all of you who are considering buying this product and seeking some insight n nupdate 1 also wish this had a altimeter like fitbit one to measure if u r climbing a slope or stairs to more accurately measure calories burned i forgot to state in the video that you can measure your calorie intake by recording your daily food intake or just snap pictures of your food and have a picture food journal overall i have no major issues yet to report and am still sticking with a lenient four star review as i think we will see a more development with such products in the near future the purpose of this product seems not to just look at the activities and calorie intake of one day at a time but rather a comparative and progressive approach to measure the progress from the past days weeks etc n nupdate 2 have had it almost a week now and must say that i have been increasingly become more active everyday there are some minor concerns i would like to report firstly the band tends to become wider and loose over time the reason being this does not have a clipping mechanism such as the nike fuel bracelet it is just 1 strip of spring steel that you are suppose to widen to get your hand in or out of it depending if you are removing it to sync or wearing it back this constant removal and putting on of the band along with the fact that the band naturally slides towards your elbow down your wrist makes the band more loose over time jawbone should have had a bracelet clipping mechanism also as far as the ios app is concerned you can form teams with your friends who have the band and compare your sleep activities food intake with them but can not compete add unknown people who share the same goal as you and a major drawback is there is no 3rd party app integration with more commonly used finess apps such as my fitness pal lose it daily burn nike and many more also there is no way to input you desired weight and the app itself does not adjust the calories you should burn eat incase you are losing weight also another factor taken out of the equation is heart rate i would expect a fitness bracelet worn on the wrist especially to detect heart rate since heart rate has a direct correlation with calories burned the app lacks many features although the ui is nice i am amazed there is no integration with social networks like facebook and twitter also it is only compatible with iphone although i am not complaining many of my friends have android and no support yet there also no way to sync your device with a mac pc and no online support for storing seeing your band info incase you do n t have an iphone android fitbit has a big advantage over this as fitbit devices support macs pc have an online syncing tool and have many 3rd party app integration also another drawback is there is no way to set multiple alarms really in this day and age we do n t have the same schedule everyday if i have to wake up at 8 am on monday i have to sync it with the phone to change the alarm if i have to wake up at 6 am on tuesday overall i hope jawbone really steps up the game especially on their software side apps as the hardware limitations will be there till they decide to release a 3rd gen up band as i said before one other competitor jawbone has to watch out for is the larklife band the battery life is great and should last you 9 10 days
6;12;11;0.8585840971307634;final update read below to get full context n nthree days after i was promised one i still have not received a return shipping label from jawbone for my exchange i am really disappointed with this process and am returning my jawbone to amazon i m really frustrated because i think i am probably in the minority with this defective hardware but i do n t want to risk going through this process again n n n ni love the concept of being able to easily capture information about my day to day aesthetically i think it looks better than competitors and that it is wearable rather than something you have to clip to clothing n nafter the initial release of the up i was ready to buy but held off based on widespread reports of hardware failure after the second wave of the up was released i was keen to give it a shot unfortunately at least in my case it seems the hardware problems have not been resolved n ni have a jawbone up which i received and began using december 24 it worked for approximately 6 hours and synced successfully but now about five minutes after each sync goes into the lost clock condition with the led just pulsing various clocks when the button is pressed occasionally the band will be completely unresponsive and no led with display when the button is pressed n nwith only one successful sync i really do n t feel like i can comment further on the capabilities of the up mine simply did n t function the best thing i can say is that it is comfortable n ni m going to do one exchange before just returning will update if it s actually functional n nupdate 1 n ni ve been working with jawbone support to secure a replacement the customer support is courteous but it is a long process even after detailing the troubleshooting steps i have taken i was required to run the full battery again over the phone with a jawbone rep before being allowed to exchange the device n nupdate 2 n njawbone missed the first window i set up to walkthrough troubleshooting i was issued a reference number to use to call them at my convenience but this unfortunately also entailed waiting on hold for about 10 minutes in the end it took about 20 minutes from placing the call to the rep from jawbone who was very polite and pleasant to agree to accept a return of the band they said it was likely a hardware issue based on the symptoms and attributed it to being possibly roughed up in shipping n ni ll now be receiving an email with instructions for submitting my amazon receipt then will be sent a prepaid shipping label after they receive my old jawbone they apparently will be shipping me a new one overnight n ni will update again after being able to use the replacement n nupdate 3 n n48 hours after submitting a amazon receipt i have yet to receive a shipping label but have submitted a request for an update from jawbone
7;29;28;0.8564761434206999;i had the first generation up band by jawbone eventually killing it while snowboarding i ve watched the launch of fitbits and fuelbands but nothing quite had everything i was looking for when i saw the new revised up bands in an apple store in mint green a true celeste green for you bike nerds out there my amex was out and ready to rock n nthe killer app for me is really the sleep monitoring and alarm in a handy form factor i need to be up and out the door before my husband so having an alarm that will wake me and not the rest of the house is critical the vibrate level is just right insistent without being jarring like a blaring alarm clock i m an active sleeper so it tends towards the earlier range of the light sleep cycle for me but that s more of an individual problem n nthe lack of bluetooth is a bonus in my situation i work in environments where i may not necessarily be able to dump a bt signal all over the place and syncing with the headphone jack is not nearly the imposition others might have you believe i typically sync in my office while i m waiting for my work laptop to come out of sleep and pull email it s trivial and straightforward and worth losing the bulk and energy drain of a bt transmitter for n naside from the loss of the blue led for sleep mode which is a negligible problem in my opinion my complaints are mostly software related with the app the minty green color seems to pick up dirt quickly but that would be a problem with a normal mint green bracelet that i wore constantly too not really a design flaw it does not look stupid in a professional environment with a suit jacket n nthe app is a little annoying for layout and is missing weight tracking weight tracking and more prominent calorie metrics would release me from having to dual enter data into livestrong s myplate app it should support landscape mode looks at the charts and more options in the trends section so that you can see correlations more easily i m hopeful for future releases n nit s worth noting for my fellow data junkies that you can get the raw data dumps from your up band off of the jawbone website underneath your account settings plenty of opportunity for data crunching on a subject you should be very familiar with you n nlike everyone i m hoping that jawbone has actually solved the water permeability issues from the previous incarnation but i m optimistic about where the new up band could go tweaking the software would definitely be a great place to go
8;9;8;0.8561907408629675;i have never felt a need to write a negative review more than i have for this product this has just been an awful experience for me to the point where i will never own another jawbone product even if one was given to me as a gift i d throw it out n ni ve gone through multiple gen 2 up bands the reason being is after 6 weeks they just stop working there is no gradual decline or indication that it will die they just die i ve gone through the rma process where they will make you do multiple resets of the device and then will send you a replacement after you send them back the broken band the new one will come work ok for awhile notice that i did n t say well and then like clockwork at about the 6 week mark it just stops working n nwhen the band was working my results fluxuate between extremely precise to so inaccurate i do n t know what it s doing it was n t uncommon for it to just disappear during workout mode i d have a 45 minute workout and there would be a 15 minute window in the middle of it where it did n t record anything even though my movements were identical before and after the blackout n nif you call jawbone about this they ll tell you it s you and you should do a soft reset of the device n nthe sleep mode is nowhere near accurate especially when i compared it with a lark it ll have me in a deep sleep when i m in bed reading a book may even get up and get a glass of water so there is plenty of movement it does n t detect this i m in deep sleep however when i am asleep i get lots of awake time and footsteps captured i m pretty sure i m not sleep walking to the extent of 1500 steps n nif you call jawbone about this they ll tell you it s you and you should do a soft reset of the device n nthere is a calibration feature that is supposed to make the device more accurate so i got on the treadmill and walked exactly 1 2 mile so i could use that to calibrate the band detected that i walked much greater than that and when i was able to adjust the distance for the walk the lowest option they offered was 1 2 miles yet the number of steps it counted was pretty close to what i was counting in my head it must think that i am 9 feet tall and my strides cover a great distance n ni did n t bother calling jawbone about this by this point i know they are of no help n ni had a band that would n t even accept a soft or hard reset i tried this on one before i called knowing they would tell me to n nif you call jawbone about this they tell you that nobody else has experienced this but they will begrudingly replace it yet their forums are full of people who have this exact issue n nafter my most recent band started vibrating and would n t stop until the battery died i ve decided i had enough there is n t anything out there yet that tracks movements sleep and provides an awesome workout and food journal really well but that does n t mean any of us should settle for a product that is so flawed that i spend more time on the phone with customer support than i do analyzing the data it gathered n nhere s to hoping that fitbit flex is a little better when it makes it to market

1;20;18;0.7921019269018186;i received this umbrella as a gift so i m not sure exactly what vendor it was purchased from when it s open and in use it s excellent it really does hold up to strong wind and i also like the feel of the contoured wood handle much nicer than holding a cold damp piece of plastic or metal in a storm n nthe sad problem with this umbrella is the latch on the shaft that s supposed to keep it closed it is very weak and the umbrella often pops open unexpectedly this has caused some scary close calls for me when carrying the closed umbrella with the umbrella almost hitting children and pets in the face and popping open in stores and restaurants n nthe worst part of this problem is that i wrote to the gustbuster company in detail about this problem the umbrella came with a warranty card it s been over six months and i have not heard a peep back from them it s a shame that a product that is almost great has such an annoying flaw it s even worse that the company does n t seem to give a damn about it
2;36;27;0.791802289970778;last year i ordered this umbrella from amazon i like the size and like the fact it should n t turn inside out in the wind however the automatic feature did n t work and when i closed the umbrella it would n t latch closed then would spring back open they come with a lifetime warranty so i contacted the company and they sent me a return authorization number i spent 20 to fedex it to them for repair or replacement then heard nothing for a month to follow up i called them and they a had no idea where it was they showed it came in but had no idea after that and b could n t send me a new black one for three more months what the heck what a way to run a business i d use my other pricey collapsible gust buster but it is manual and too much to deal with in manhattan rain getting in and out of cabs etc for the price i paid i d have been better off buying then replacing as needed totes automatic collapsing umbrellas the gustbuster automatics are good in theory but pricey and paired with lousy execution and worse customer service n nbtw three months came and went and still no replacement during the rainiest season requiring two more calls in order to get something anything i had to settle for a green automatic umbrella which i do n t like n nalso and this is a personal preference matter i do n t love the curved handle
3;27;23;0.7894052632681519;i walk from the train station to my office every day and do n t like getting my trousers wet when it rains last week it rained hard and my small totes umbrella left me soaked from my knees to my shoes i ordered my gustbuster that very day from amazon i selected the 48 inch golf umbrella which is clearly described in the advert blurb as 48 inches in diameter i considered purchasing the larger umbrella but negotiating crowded city side walks with a 60 inch umbrella seemed too dangerous the umbrella arrived promptly and it appears sturdy in construction and attractive in appearance however it seemed much smaller than the advertised 48 inches in diameter and smaller than my needs i measured the diameter and found it was 40 inches not 48 inches it appears that the 48 inches refers to a measurement over the dome which is not a useful metric and is very misleading now i wish i purchased the 60 inch umbrella n nupdate on 10 1 2010 i just walked to my office through the first really hard rain and wind storm since i purchased the gustbuster it did not invert even though the gusts were reportedly hitting 40 mph as i feared however the umbrella dumped the runoff directly onto my legs and shoes due to the insufficient 40 inch diameter i am soaked from my knees to my socks good enough for a shower perhaps but not for a downpour n nupdate on 8 25 2015 in the intervening years i had my original gustbuster taken from a communal umbrella stand so i purchased another i am sorry to say that this one completely inverted in a windy rain storm the fabric was torn off two of the supports i do n t know what the wind speed was that day but i was very disappointed
4;32;28;0.7429270677692767;i bought this overpriced umbrella because it was advertised to beat the winds and it did n t exactly do that i was in nyc and it gets very windy there and this umbrella broke from the hinges which push and keep the umbrella open i have seen other reviews describing a similar problem the hinges do n t appear to be well made with a decent quality material and explains why it broke what a waste of 35 dollars ni would not advise others to buy this why not buy a 10 umbrella so you wo n t have to regret it when it breaks
5;39;22;0.735051269051784;most of the product s description is correct it is well designed and holds up to strong winds i was a big fan of mine until it broke i then learned that the warranty is not really effective which is something you may want to consider after mine broke one of the threads that holds the canape to the spokes failed i called to have it repaired they were happy to honor the warranty but they demand that you pay for the shipping in both directions after you find an umbrella shaped box mail it to them and pay them the 10 dollars they require for shipping and handling to get it back to you you might as well have just bought a new one not sure if this is still the case but last i looked they were under 30 dollars nfor now i ve just fixed mine with bit of copper wire it seems to be holding up so far
6;28;12;0.7134507969440197;i purchased this for my wife a few weeks ago the cap on the end of the umbrella broke and fell off i called customer service and they wanted me to send the umbrella back at my expense and send a 10 check for return shipping huh n nexpect to wait 6 8 weeks for any action on your warranty repair because they only address warranty returns every few weeks n n so your umbrella just sits in their warehouse in a pile and when they are ready to go through the pile your umbrella will be fixed as long as you have included 10 for return shipping this is what they told me when i called 2 weeks after being delivered to their warehouse so let s do the math you pay 10 shipping to them 10 return shipping 20 to get a manufacture defect corrected for me that was more than half of the total price so if the same umbrella has two warranty issues you have now paid more for the umbrella that originally paid n nno customer service nnice revenue generator with a product that has defective parts n nkeep in mind that this is for a 5 cent part that could have been mailed to me for a total cost of 50 cents but that s how they do business n nif you want to purchase from a company that does not support their product without ridiculous charges to fix their defect or provide customer service at any level go ahead and take your chances n ni have purchased a total of 4 of these and two have been sent back two still waiting for repair 6 weeks and counting n ni will never purchase or recommend this product to anyone because of their lack of customer service and obvious defects
7;21;16;0.713209705083721;look up diameter in the dictionary it says the straight line distance across a circular object this umbrella is only 48 if you measure along the rounded outer edge while open look at reviews for other gb umbrellas and you ll see people reporting them as smaller than described this one is only around 37 diameter i called the company about this and spoke to a man who identified himself as the company president 1 888 487 8287 he was rude interrupted me constantly and would n t let me even finish a sentence first he said that that was the standard definition and then he told me that he did n t believe me when i quoted his own website he did say he would get the website description changed but that does n t make selling me an umbrella smaller than described ok n nat this point i m not going to buy another gb umbrella just because i do n t want to give money to a company who thinks it s ok to treat a customer the way i was treated on the phone
8;15;9;0.6984258164212951;i ordered this umbrella a few months ago on back order and was excited for it to arrive i watched the videos and thought this product would be great for my commute to my dismay when the umbrella arrived i opened the triangular package no padding or other protective measures which others may have commented on already and opened up the umbrella to find the beginnings of a crack on the fiberglass shaft n nto be fair i asked for a re shipment and received the next in two day s time however the second was no better actually the next umbrella was exactly the same with the same chip in the fiberglass perhaps every umbrella is like this but for me at least this is unacceptable given the price i m paying needless to say i ve returned them both n nmy main worry was that the umbrella s shaft would eventually crack fully with use which is what i saw later in a two star review by the allen on mar 24 2015 based on my testing the plastic piece that locks into place upon closing the umbrella slides right over this chip which has a small metal piece protruding from the shaft after only a few test opens closes i could hear the fiberglass very slowly chipping away which like i said before was unacceptable for me n nperhaps it was a bad batch but given my experience and what i ve heard from others in the same boat i would n t buy from this company again i do n t normally write reviews at all but this experience was so bad that i wanted to warn others
9;33;34;0.6858778631623025;positives four months of use in the wind and rain and this umbrella has worked perfectly easy to open and close sturdy design it s held up in 40 mph wind gusts good classic look my umbrella does not have the large logo that some others apparently to contain n nnegatives the umbrella s wood handle is satisfactory from an aesthetics standpoint a higher grade of wood would really improve this umbrella s looks and would result in a five star rating from me n nsummary this is a good looking and very functional umbrella on a personal note i m a big guy and this size umbrella works well for me however it s a little small for me and a second person overall i m happy with my purchase

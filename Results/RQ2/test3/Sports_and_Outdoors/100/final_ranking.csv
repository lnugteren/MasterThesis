0;76;75;0.8954941917077113;picked this scope up for my ruger 10 22 with archangel nomad stock kit was looking over the description at the time and seemed like it was offering a lot of features for a very reasonable price in fact for all the features it had to offer i was certain that there was going to be a gotcha in there somewhere like cheap optics and or cheap build however i figured for a 22 lr rifle that was essentially going to be a plinker and range toy it really did n t need expensive top end optics to begin with n nwhat a pleasant surprise this scope has been thus far it more than met my expectations by far yes it features all the bells and whistles as per the description illuminated crosshairs that can be switched to either red or green with varying intensity parallax adjustment tactical style knobs for windage compensation pop up lens caps and sunshade and quick disconnect clamps for mounting on a picatinny rail however the build quality of the scope itself is surprisingly good especially considering the very reasonable price tag for what you get the heart and soul of any scope is of course the optics and this one does not disappoint i found the optics to be very clear and bright with no appreciable distortion nice field of view and very good eye relief knobs and rings move freely without excessive tightness like i have experienced with a couple of previous scopes with overall a good feel to them finally the quick disconnect clamps really do seem to hold the scope on securely and yet makes it easy to remove the scope should i wish to go to iron sights or swap to another rifle n nfield performance has had no complaints so far have fired about 100 rounds and scope has held zero just fine no issues with durability although it s not as if firing a 22 at the range is going to be very hard on equipment lol n nverdict n nhave to give this product 5 5 i m honestly not finding any real fault with this scope unless something strange happens down the road to change my mind i feel that this scope really offers a lot of value for the money and would have no problem recommending it n n update n nwell looks like this scope has had it s trial by fire accidentally fumbled the scope as i was trying to mount it on my rifle and i dropped it not only that but it bounced off of a sharp rock putting a nice little nick in one of the scope rings guess what not only was the scope itself undamaged but it held it s zero i ve put about 500 rounds through the rifle with the scope mounted since that incident with no issues whatsoever i think i can safely report that this scope on top of all the other features is durable n nthat being the case i would actually upgrade my review and say this is a phenomenal scope for the money
1;99;96;0.888419886813278;first impressions where really good until i unlocked the zero unlocking ring for the windage and elevation turrets after unscrewing turning 40 70 degrees per instructions the locking ring i quickly found out that the windage turret did n t click at all and was actually sitting on the scope on an angle after loosening the zero reset allen and trying to straighten and re tighten i got it to sit a little better but still not sitting straight once i try to turn the windage past the number 2 on the scope it suddenly becomes super loose and just spins on the turrets no clicking no resistance at all just becomes really loose the elevation turret seems to be just fine n nother than the turret issue it seems like a pretty good scope but not great pretty solid and has some nice weight to it although the rear flip open cover is pretty pointless due to it just falling off the scope while trying to open flip the cap with one finger so you must use both hands to open the cap your left hand holding the ring and the other lifting the tab with your right index finger or it will just slide pop right off the scope if i had to do it all over again i would buy something else i am hoping to get it out and see if it is still operational this weekend but i am pretty sure i will need a 4 x 8 sheet a plywood at 25 yards to see where this thing is hitting if so it is for sure going back and i will avoid this brand of scope for good i normally buy leupold and simmons and wanted to try something for a decent price for a 22lr gun but i guess the old saying is you get what you pay for and that is true with this scope n non another note i bought this scope for my smith and wesson m p 15 22 and i even bought higher scope rings nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href accushot premium 1 inch weaver style see thru high pro rings dp b001wj6908 ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 accushot premium 1 inch weaver style see thru high pro rings a nbsp for this scope and it still sits too low to the rail with where this scope sits and the eye relief it has not bad either you can barely fit your fingers under the back end of the scope to grab the charging handle so i would probably get a high riser rail 1 for this and the highest scope mounts you can find if your plan on getting it for an ar 15 platform n nso all in all this would be a great scope for air soft guns or 177 bb pellet guns but for anything that actually shoots bullets i would avoid unless for some reason i got a lemon or dud who knows n nupdate 04 08 12 so after taking this scope shooting this weekend i finally got it zeroed in it took me about 30 40 rounds but i finally got it pretty good i had to turn the windage turret to the right or clockwise about 6 7 full complete turns and the elevation about 3 4 full turns up but after turning and turning on the turrets to get it to where it is supposed to everything seems pretty good
2;7;57;0.8791459964837526;i read quite a few of the 370 reviews of this scope here on amazon and i took a chance the concerns i had were about getting one with a tilted reticule not a big issue due to how easy it is to return and optical clarity n nreticule no issues straight as it should be noptical clarity very good no it is not nikon or leupold but it is very good some distortion at the edge of the view but you really have to concentrate to see them n ni like how compact it is less than 2 3 of my nikon prostaff 3x9 bdc the cross hair is rather on the thick side but not to the point where it becomes an issue n ni do n t care about the illumination feature you can not see it in full daylight even at max and i wish they had a model without this feature it would be even more lightweight and compact n nthe turrets track perfectly poi was 6 at 100 yards 24 clicks down and it was right on n ni have this scope on a sig 556r 7 62x39 the rifle does n t have much of recoil to speak about heavy and a muzzle brake but the scope looks like it can take serious recoil n nthe qd rings are ok but the qd levers became loose after about 600 rounds and i had to re tighten them replacing them with the high profile utg rings with butterfly wing nuts the rings that come with the scope are medium height and do n t leave enough clearance for buis under the scope n nbottom line this is a lot of value for the price with this being offered i do n t see any reason to spend hundreds on big name tactical scopes to shoot at the range n nsee the picture i uploaded 20 rounds at 100 yards 7 62x39 with sig 556r rapid fire as quick as i was reacquiring the target using a bipod wolf wpa ammo for tactical scopes i think it is as good as it gets n nedit i initially gave this 5 stars since i considered to be a lot of value for the price after about 600 rounds the windage turret stopped working clicks but the reticule does n t track returning it and getting a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href nikon p 223 3x32 matte bdc carbine dp b006z07jte ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 nikon p 223 3x32 matte bdc carbine a the utg would be a very good scope if you get one that keeps working as designed but it appears that its quality is hit or miss i thought i could prove wrong those saying that with optics you get what you pay for but i was the one proven wrong i ll stay with tried and true which for me is nikon

4;20;31;0.859722646157335;some people have complained about a tilted reticle i did not experience this so hopefully utg corrected this problem the scope itself feels very durable and well made the variable power adjustment ring and front ao are pretty stiff which is nice the w e turrets have a very positive click and have locking rings another cool feature is that the turrets are zero resetting meaning that once you set it to zero you can undo the top allen screw and reset it to the 0 position so that any future adjustments can be visualized and returned to 0 the rings that came with the scope are very solid however i ordered a pair of the qd high rise rings to lift the scope up to accommodate magpul sights the eye relief is pretty good at between 4 5 and for my ar set up it is perfect the scope also came with two cr 1620 button batteries for the reticle illumination the illumination is nice and i could see its use for low light or dark contrast targets but i do n t ever see myself using this feature the optics are very clear and crisp for this price scope the flip up lens caps are nice but they are slightly bulky and the rear one does not fit with the mbus under it so i will have to find another cap option n noverall the scope is very well made and seems to be an amazing value for the price i would definitely recommend this item for those who do not want to spend a ton of money on a scope but want something that is decent quality it mounted to my rifle fairly easily and i will be testing it soon so i will provide an update once i have it zeroed and am confident that it holds
5;89;55;0.8553301028649126;i searched for quite a while for a compact scope for my ar i read several reviews on alot of different scope when i saw this scope i was impressed with all the positive reviews the price was in my budget so i ordered it nright out of the package i was impressed with the look and feel of the utg once at the range it was very easy to sight in the images through the scope are very clear as well as the rectile the illumination for the rectile is nice but i really have n t used it yet the turets for windage and elevation adjustments are easy to lock and unlock the also have a very audible click when making adjustments which is very helpful nthe only thing i recommend is using a riser under the scope my ar is a flat top and i used a 3 4 inch riser which put the scope at just the right level once i put this on it only took two rounds of three shots to sight it back in nso far it has held zero very well for the money i spent i am very pleased with the scope
6;59;33;0.8430782176319815;i am at a loss as to why there are any positive reviews on this scope other than it does have a lot of eye candy when you first look at it nnow i ll share with you what i received after purchasing this scope first it has a wire cross hair which in and of itself is n t a bad thing if it s made correctly mine has the top of the vertical hair welded to the right side of the support post and the bottom of the hair is welded to the left side of the post this makes the vertical hair cant sideways the center of a cross hair should be comprised of 4 right angles of 90 degrees for each quadrant mine is 98 degrees on the top l and 83 degrees on the top r on the bottom l it is 102 degrees and the r is 78 degrees which tells me the horizontal hair is also canted what this does is make it impossible to adjust the elevation without changing the horizontal sight picture this make sighting the scope in to the center point almost impossible and the hash marks worthless nthe focus for the cross hair does n t have a locking mechanism so it turns every time you shoot why they put an a o on this scope is beyond me a scope is usually paralex free up to 9 power if you adjust the a o for a clear picture at your target and your target moves less than one foot it is out of focus needing adjustment nif you use the sunshade the flip up cover wo n t fit if you wear any type of hat with a bill such as a baseball style one the flip up on the front wo n t allow you to see through the scope nover the decade of my shooting and hunting life i have purchased over 50 scopes this scope is probably the worst one i ve ever owned and i m going to try to see if i can get my money back nplease believe me and do n t purchase this scope it will disappoint you immensely
7;25;32;0.8376688494394449;my expectations were low based on the price i ll admit it i m a bit of a snob when it comes to rifle scopes i usually mount leupold vx ii scopes on my rifles i was pleasantly surprised by this scope n ni purchased it for use on a flat top ar 15 carbine but to try it out i mounted the scope on a series of remington 700 rifles i figured that if i was going to break it i might as well do it right off the bat sixty rounds of 180gr 30 06 hunting loads thirty rounds of 168gr 308 win target loads thirty rounds of 80gr 223 rem target loads and finally another five rounds on the 30 06 i was able to re adjust the scope back to the zero settings i wrote down for each rifle and the point of impact was right on n ndiopter adjustment works as does the objective focus both are a bit stiff to turn perhaps it will loosen up over time the scale on the objective adjustment is off by quite a bit for example focusing on the target at 100 yards and the scale shows the yardage between the 25 and 50 yard hash marks only detractor is the edges of the image are just slightly out of focus compared to the center of the image n nturret markings are good adding and removing moa via the turrets indeed shifts the point of impact the correct distance i did not see any problems with the windage changing with elevation changes i have not tried to compute adjustments using the mil dots on the recticle yet i ll leave that for another day perhaps next week when temps drop below freezing again to also see if the scope has any issues with fogging n nall around a good scope for a shooter on a tight budget
8;11;88;0.8339971057383709;i did a lot of research on different scopes for a budget build for my smith wesson m p 15 5 56 i decided on this one from amazon after considering the pro s and con s on the reviews and the cost of the scope i ordered the scope on 6 24 12 and it arrived on 6 26 12 2 days with no extra special shipping arrangements first thing i d suggest is reading the manual until you understand the instructions since the manual covers more then one type of scope one thing the instructions does n t cover is leveling the mounting platform and leveling the scope during installation two cheap line levels will do the trick also i d suggest a little blue locktite to keep everything secure everything on the scope arrived in perfect condition no complaints there proper mounting of the scope made the initial sight in process a breeze i did purchase a medium 1 2 inch riser for the rail the scope qd rings sits low on the rail so if you have a magpul iron site the 1 2 inch riser is perfect to fit the scope over the iron sight and still provide excellent eye relief the scopes qd is great if you want to access your iron sights in a hurry remember the boresighter process is for the initial sight in and not intended for zeroing you just want to be able to hit the paper then go to the range and fine tune the sight in to achieve zeroing this scope has performed better then expected and in my opinion is worth more then the 80 it cost if you re doing a budget build this is the scope to buy please this is my opinion considering my own experience with this scope others will have different views so read all the reviews and make up your own mind
9;14;16;0.8338980400977078;this scope is amazing so amazing that i d rather have this one over an acog i used to be an acog fanboy but i ve come to conclusion they are very overrated and unless you want to use you rifle optics as a hammer which with the acog i m sure you could and it would be fine because they are durable the utg is the way to go i ve had the opportunity to use the classic 4x32 and it was nice but you pay 1200 and you are limited to just 4x the utg you have 3 9x and you can adjust the eye relief a smaller point between the two is the mounts the utg is quick release levers that hold tight the acog has the hand screws that hold just as tight but takes just a little longer to put on and take off not a big deal but it is a perk of the utg the illumination is with red or green on the acog you get both on the utg i will say not having to change batteries with the acog would be nice but an the utg you can adjust the cross hair brightness with a dimmer switch like function unlike most scopes and red dots that have hard settings this scope works without batteries too it works just like any other scopes that have black cross hairs the scope covers are solid and you do n t need to take them completely off to shoot i will say the front one does n t fit that well with the shade extension or if you adjust the eye relief the scope cover rotates with it but you can just take it off so not a big deal i ve put 200 rounds over 2 separate trips to the range through my rock river arms ar 15 and it s held 0 flawlessly i even fumbled the rifle with the scope on it it landed on the table and not the ground thank god and even after that it held zero i m sure i m missing some talking points but oh well you ca n t get a better scope under 100 i picked mine up for 64 and some change on amazon on another note amazon had this scope cheaper than anywhere else i looked at
10;19;54;0.8072883088475468;pros nno this scope is not made in the usa but the quality seems to be pretty good for a non american product by having the scope made outside of the us the price is brought down the quality of utg leapers products is definitely better than nc star products i bought this to mount on a 5 56 2 23 rifle the scope held up great at the range and the glass did n t fall apart due to the recoil the scope is supposedly nitrogen filled rain proof fog proof and shock proof like you would expect for any half decent scope n nbecause this scope has external windage and elevation knobs the locking ring features come in handy for keeping your zero when transporting your rifle in a case the magnification ring is a bit stiff but that s a lot better than having a loose magnification ring if you the scope does have a reticle that can be illuminated but the good thing is that you do n t have to use the illumination n nif you buy this scope keep in mind that it uses a second focal plane mil dot reticle this means that if you want to do range estimation you have to use a modified mil dot formula first you use the standard mil dot formula for 10x magnfication to get a preliminary range you then take this range and multiply it by your actual scope magnification and then divide by 10 to get your true range n ncons nthe scope rings that come with the package have these quick detach levers the levers seem to be slightly loose but i have n t had problems yet n nalso the dust cover for the front objective lens is too loose if you also install the sunshade if you want to use the sunshade i recommend wrapping the front of the sunshade with some black electrical tape so that the dust cover will fit on more snugly
11;79;45;0.8025847520124356;i received this scope yesterday it was immediately mounted onto my benjamin titan np 22 cal air rifle i had my doubts because i have killed 3 scopes with this gun first scope being the factory scope and the next 2 being centerpoint 4x16 40 scopes n ni am so glad i bought this scope i immediately zeroed the scope and put it through my own little performance test i fired around 200 pellets back to back and the scope never lost zero while my other scopes only lasted 15 25 shots before needing a re zero n nthe internals were straight as with others they were tilted slightly i highly recommend this scope with what i have seen so far n nin the long term i do n t know how this scope will perform but i think this one will last a good while n ni will update in the future if i run into any issues n nupdate 03 24 2015 n nscope still holding zero after about 1000 shots n nupdate 04 04 2015 n nscope is still holding true a buddy of mine bought a leapers 4x32 on amazon for 39 and his is holding true also great scopes for the money and can definitely hold up to magnum air rifles he has the same gun but in 177 cal n nupdate 4 15 2015 n nchanged my review to a 3 star the scope finally gave way and started to drift off zero i re zeroed twice in 2 days and on the 3rd day it was still off it drifted 1 4 inches at 15 yards after about 50 shots which would be massive at 40 50 yards i made sure it was the scope and not the air rifle i cleaned the barrel and tightened stock screws along with the barrel pivot screws and scope mount screws all of which were very tight n ni still believe these scopes are great scopes for what you pay i opted to receive a replacement and give it another shot since i really do like these scopes luckily i still had 2 days to return i will be updating when my replacement comes in n nupdate 05 05 2014 n nwhat garbage when i received my replacement i noticed it was an old gen i said to myself well ill just give it a try about 2 days after i got this scope i did n t use it since had ordered a benjamin discovery and i put it on my discovery i went to a buddies house this past weekend and man we could not get that discovery to shoot a decent group to save our lives i went and cleaned the rifle and i even went as far as washing the pellets and lubing with paraffin wax nothing n nwait here is the good part i had an old barska 22 plinkster scope on my 22lr and i thought i m just going to put this scope on it just to see and wala been shooting bullseyes ever since with a scope i payed 25 dollars for 2 years ago n nnever buying leapers again my buddies scope is still going strong but i have faith it will go the way of the eskimo hopefully before his warranty is up
12;34;12;0.7809798909910691;pretty good scope the illumination feature seems a bit gimmicky to me pretty cool looking but i m not sure how much use it is any setting above about 25 kinda bleeds and get blurry also seems like it causes my eyes to dilate and the target gets dark i can imagine on a higher quality scope that the illumination would be a nice thing but on this one i just do n t find myself using it n notherwise the parallax adjustment is great the focus is really good the magnification is great the etched glass cross hairs are really nice and crisp the entire thing seems very well built holds zero firing 5 56 223 i love that it s short and the quick release mounts are super nice it seems to hold zero when removing it from the rifle and putting it back on the turret locks adjustments are really nice and easy to use looks really cool too i do wish it had a place to mount and handle to manipulate the magnification adjustment it s a bit stiff n nget this scope totally worth the money
13;61;26;0.766061374725172;fantastic scope for the money at this price it s more like you re buying the quick release rings caps and sun shade and getting a variable power scope with illuminated reticle free bought it for a 10 22 takedown simply because of its size i read many reviews that said the 10 22 will fit in the stock bag with the scope attached i believe that it will but i have n t tried it yet i zeroed it at 100 yds on a 300 blk ar to test and that is where it has stayed for under 100 actually about 80 i ll buy another for the 10 22 n nis it crystal clear from edge to edge no if you focus it in the middle it s clear about 3 4 of the way across if you focus near the edge it s clear around the edge who cares if your application or tastes demand better why are you wasting your time reading about an 80 scope n nwill i pass this down to kids or grandkids someday dude it was less than 100 who cares will it break if i drop it it has n t yet if it does i ll buy another will it hold zero for 1 000 rounds and will the adjustments still be accurate who knows all good after a couple hundred rounds of 300 blk i ll update this review if that changes but you wo n t hear me complain my cost per round for the scope is already less than the ammo or the rifle
14;54;17;0.7419234079398117;i bought this scope to mount on a century c308 7 62x51mm rifle another reviewer stated that this scope furnished rings fit his c308 out of the box it does but nmy own experience is that yes it does fit and allows plenty of room for the c308 cocking handle however for my eyes the scope must be positioned as far back as possible on the picatinny rail to achieve correct eye relief to do that requires removing the rear dust cover on the scope the included utg scope rings are their medium height rings measuring 15mm from the rail to the saddle the utg high rings are 5mm higher 20mm i ll be ordering a set of those tomorrow which should allow me to use the rear dust cover the weather has not cooperated to allow me to take the gun out and sight in the scope but i expect it to perform very well when setting it up i found no indication of a tilted reticle as a couple of reviewers mentioned hint put your gun in a padded vise lay a bubble level across the picatinny rail and adjust until level mount the rings position the scope then lay the level across the windage knob adjust until level then carefully tighten down the rings
15;36;7;0.6808320891204807;wow this scope is very nice it looks great on my carbine the image is a lot easier to acquire than i was expecting i was pretty worried that i would be spending too much time trying to find the target while in a hurry due to what i imagined was going to be a too small of a area or viewing portal to see through while trying to quickly acquire the target but that concern is so totally gone the viewing portal is a good bit larger than i was anticipating and that means that the target is very quickly acquired because the sight picture regarding this scope pretty much just dominates forces a good clear image onto the eye the crosshairs are not too thick do not hide any target that is out to 100 meters buying this scope verifies that i m no idiot everything about this scope is excellent quality i d buy this scope again w o hesitation i looked hundreds of scopes in this price range before selecting this one it is everything i was looking for in a rifle scope
16;13;10;0.5950436869847369;this is the perfect scope for a rugerr 10 22 take down the scope is the perfect length and if mounted properly it lines up with the very end of the receiver portion of the rifle when taken apart it also fits nice and tight in the gun bag note it will not mount properly with the useless ruger rail that comes with the tactical version of the rifle i mounted it on the rail mount listed below and i am really happy with how well it works nruger 10 22 long see through scope mount nmsp

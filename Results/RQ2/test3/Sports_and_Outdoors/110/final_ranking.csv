0;8;15;0.8692347718910702;i found the other reviews really helpful when i decided to purchase so make sure to read reviews both good and bad n nit s lightweight for something of that size easy to fold up and roll around the wider stats machine and cup thingy is really helpful there is a second shallower cup where you can place a cell phone or music player etc the stats machine is small and somewhat hard to read while walking maybe it s the dim lighting in my room but i do n t use it because i d rather track my progress on an app on my phone however i love that my walking is what powers the stats machine no batteries to change unless it sits for a really long time the walking recharges the batteries included so it s entirely self contained and eco friendly n nthe incline is somewhat steep but as others said you get used to it however that may be more difficult for those who already have some trouble walking or are disabled i m young and relatively fit the incline is important though it s what makes it easy to start the belt you could adjust the height by placing something sturdy under the back end but that could make the machine less sturdy and certainly will make it harder to get the belt moving initially and perhaps throughout your workout i do n t know whether it would help but you can get silicone belt lubricants to help keep your belt moving smoothly n nyou will generally want to have your hands on the handles provided which is awkward at first perhaps as i get more used to the machine i ll be able to pump my arms and get an even better cardio workout n nit s sound is pretty quiet and does n t travel through the wall to my neighbors however as someone said above in the questions part it can be loud if you re a hard walker if you stomp on it the sound will carry n nthe packaging and putting together the machine was all in a box i could move upstairs by myself though it was a bit awkward 5 2 woman of average strength there were n t many parts 5 if i remember which was a great thing the instructions were confusing at first and required a few reads the belt part was already assembled and the instructions just asked you to make sure it was centered could have shifted in shipping mine happened to be fine however i had a big problem that took about 45 minutes to fix one of the metal side poles hole at the end was dented i could n t fit the top cross bar into it i did n t want to return this whole thing for something that simple so i fought with it for a long time with pliers and any other tools i had in the house it was dented inward so a hammer could n t do it of course this was the first step in assembly so i did n t feel so happy about my purchase at the time in the end my much stronger husband was able to un dent it enough after four or five tries after that assembly was a breeze i ve included a picture of the box when i opened it
1;78;55;0.8639308472473216;i was a little skeptical about getting this treadmill but i definitely do not regret getting it first of the packaging was good and everything was there installation was not very difficult just took a little time to understand exactly what the manual was saying you are going to need someone to help you put it together and tested it the electronic display did not work properly but that was because i missed a connection that i found the day after and it worked i got the treadmill about 1 week ago and its been working great still i have no complaints whatsoever it is an excellent exercise machine and it is more of a workout that i expected i used to go walking on mornings before but could n t keep it up i would walk for about 1 hr non stop 15 minutes on this treadmill and i have to take a break the fact that you have to power the treadmill does make it more of a workout than if it was automated its also easy to move around and does n t take up much space n ni would recommend this machine to anyone never mind any negative reviews go for it you wo n t regret it
2;55;19;0.8193091747486763;first off there is free shipping with this product it ships from california and it took about 5 business days to get here during the christmas season it got here as expected and no issues found with the shipment n nit is pretty easy to set up it took me about 20 minutes i was able to do it myself but two people would be helpful but not necessarily needed please have a electric screwdriver handy as this will expedite putting it together and saving your hands from twisting the screws there was one bolt that would not screw in spent five minutes on that one alone until i got the electric screwdriver n nthere is a learning curve when walking on this if you have been used to a motorized treadmill like i was this is so different one you will notice that you will poop out quicker this is using your own body to move the tread it also took me about an hour of walking on it to get the pace down where it was n t so hard n nit is lifted in the front so you are walking up hill you can put a phone book in the back in order to make it easier if you prefer n nthe display is basic but it get the job done n nyes you will have to hold on to the rails and running would be hard it is designed for walking people if you want to run on it i would look elsewhere the belt is narrow but this is not a problem for me please take a look at the specifications before ordering there are some negative reviews due to the belt size the specs lay everything out n ni gave this a four star because it is slightly wobbly not a huge deal and should not be a deal breaker once you learn how to walk on it it because less wobbly i would highly recommend this n nupdated 12 29 2013 n nthis think is n t as wobbly as originally thought if you put the two wheel thingies on after it is folded down duh this stabilizes it quite a bit after using it some more i would say the disadvantage is if you are really tall would be hard to hold onto i am still liking this alot and glad i did n t spend a lot of money on a different treadmill
3;41;49;0.8168200819319001;this treadmill has performed flawlessly for me since assembly took about 15 minutes by myself the belt has not lost alignment and it has needed only minimal lubrication many reviewers have stated that you can not run on this treadmill this statement is simply untrue i have had mine for about 2 weeks now and have mastered walking and running hands free no problem and i ve only used it about 2 3 times a week i can even switch back and forth from walking jogging running with ease fyi i am about 5 11 and 150 lbs i personally find no fault with the handles or the incline though i did get this to run and excercise on though i ve found it useful for casual walking as well you do n t have to pu tout a lot of effort to stroll on it but you can i think if you put in the time to get comfortable on it a couple hours max is all it should take this treadmill would work for whatever use you want nthe only reason i took off a star was for the speedometer i knew that it would n t work past 3 or 4 mph due to reading the reviews but it is still stated in the description that it should work which would be really convenient but it does n t oddly i tried attaching a regular cycle computer figure out the cal number is tricky but it did n t matter cause it wouldnt read over 4mph s on this thing either no matter what calibration i put beats me
4;40;25;0.816716059136697;i was wary of buying due to some of the bad reviews but i am glad i did here is an unbiased review ni am single out of shape and hate being around other people so the gym is out i also have back injuries and walking is one of the few things that does n t leave me in a fetal ball afterwards i was able to bring all the parts upstairs in two trips with the directions it took about 15 minutes to put together the nuts bolts screws and washers are in a blister packet with the tools you will need everything went together fairly easily when i first got on the belt movement would abruptly stop it took about three minutes to find my step on this machine try standing a little further back and walk normally take full strides not fast half steps there is some noise a soft shush of the belt as it moves but not as loud as some motorized ones one reviewer was appalled because it has no motor nope this guys in manual and you are the motor there is an incline it will make you sweat a little but its not that bad and as i said earlier standing further back helps with this too i do n t use the display because it does read a little off i have a fitbit so i do n t care this is a sturdy machine i am about 167lbs and its not rickety under me
5;61;38;0.7865523086123748;i like being a good patient and get my annual physicals usually my doctor says my numbers sugar hdl ldl are fine keep up the good work after my last physical my doctor said he noticed i put on a few pounds about 7 lbs and my numbers are a bit on the high side his suggestion was to lose the weight and my numbers should be fine again n ni like the idea of walking to stay fit i did n t want to spend a lot of money on a fancy treadmill and really do n t have the room for one upon looking at the phoenix manual treadmill on amazon i thought this might be the solution i pictured myself walking on this treadmill 30 minutes a day and losing the extra weight but now realize this machine is n t the solution for me n npackaging and set up n nafter ordering the treadmill took about a week to arrive it was securely packaged with plenty of styrofoam for protection the set up directions are pretty straight forward and it took me about an hour to set up i did have one problem in that the wiring for the lcd display which shows the speed distance and such was defective i called the manufacturer and he agreed to ship replacement wires which should arrive in a few days n nmy first work out n nsince the lcd display did n t work i just used a stopwatch to time my first workout the belt moves smoothly with no shifting to the side the treadmill has about a 10 degree fixed incline because of the incline and it being manual while walking one has to grab onto to hand tubing or handle bar to keep your balance i walked on the treadmill for about 5 minutes after this my heart was pounding and i worked up a good sweat the workout sure was robust but perhaps a little too much n nmy next work out the next day n ni think the incline is causing the hard work so as other reviewers have done i put a piece of 2 x 4 wood underneath the back to decrease the incline now the incline was closer to 5 degrees i tried to walk for 30 minutes but after 20 i started to feel faint and had to stop in addition a big problem with this machine and manual treadmills is that while walking i had to hang on to the tubing or handlebars the entire time which got uncomfortable for my arms n nthe machine does give an intense workout perhaps a bit too intense that evening not only did i have the natural soreness on my legs which is understandable but one of my achilles started to hurt which is not good and ni had pain in one of my knees n nafter my second workout i found myself having buyer s remorse and wishing i had bought a motorized treadmill instead with a motorized treadmill that should allow me to walk naturally and not hang on to keep my balance like i m using a grab bar when getting out of a slippery shower n nlikes n n good price n n easy to set up n n small footprint n n foldable n n intense robust workout possible n n lightweight only about 50 lbs n ndislikes n n ca n t move arms freely while walking have to hold on to keep balance n n difficult to walk in slow pace slow walking causes treadmill to stop which may leads to too intense workouts n n fixed incline setting not adjustable n n wiring defective for one i received n n securing knobs when folded cumbersome to use when folded there is a security pin but the pin is too short of hold the platform securely in place so one needs to use two screw in knobs but they do not screw in easily without bumping against the side frame n nin conclusion i can see that this treadmill would work if you like a short but intense workout and do n t mind having your hands not free as you need to holding on to keep your balance but workouts more than about 5 minutes can get uncomfortable mainly due to the need to to keep your balance also longer workouts may put possible wear on the body n nfor my cardio exercise i ll look for another solution currently i ll stick to my stationary bicycle and in the future perhaps look into a compact motorized treadmill which allows me to move my arms naturally while walking n nan exercise machine should adapt to your body and not the other way around
6;56;13;0.7129795020708739;i received my treadmill this week and i have to say i ve been pleasantly surprise i was skeptical about the whole manual thing since i ve always used the electric kind at gyms but i did n t want to spend hundreds of dollars so after reading reviews i went with this one it took me less than an hour to put it together directions were clear and concise and although you do have to hold on to the bars due to the natural incline the pros outweigh the cons without a doubt i was surprised at the workout i got from this thing i worked up a sweat in no time i could n t be happier with my purchase and i highly recommend this treadmill
7;17;4;0.6552574222732513;extremely unstable hard to walk on the belt additionally i get static shocks from holding on to the metal bars on the sides therefore i need to grip the rubber part on top but that makes walking even more unstable it is not a smooth quiet operation as the ad states i will return the item i wish i had not thrown away the box i know i will never use it now it is a waste of time and money
8;58;14;0.6248515025587247;i run on this thing everyday for 30 minutes for the past 3 months amazing deal and stands up to the abuse at first it can be hard to balance and run to power the treadmill instead of an electric one however i got used to it quickly and i enjoy this over large bulky electric ones now

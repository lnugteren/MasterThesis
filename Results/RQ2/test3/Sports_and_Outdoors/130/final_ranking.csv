0;35;72;0.8998768879023152;to start i got this program to get in shape and not to lose weight i lost the extra 20 lbs i was carrying through diet and a jogging pushup regiment that i did every day for about 2 months n nto get in shape if you have n t done any kind of strenuous cardio for awhile this can be a good stepping stone the 10 minute workouts will get your heart rate up and they will make you sweat however like some reviewers have mentioned not all the exercises are beginner friendly the ab routine was particularly difficult because it includes a lot of planking moves that require good balance and strong upper and lower body support just to maintain before you even do the exercise in a lot of cases however they demonstrate a modified version of the move that will make it easier n nmy advice to people is to do what tony says do your best and forget the rest if you ca n t keep up with tony and the fitness models then do n t go at your own pace but make sure you keep moving i just finished my third week i m not overweight and i still have to stop and take breaks from time to time i usually jog in place or do an oversimplified version of the move until i build up steam again n nmy biggest complaint is the focus on lower body exercises if you suck at lunges and squats like me then you will dread any day that includes the lower body video this is because if you re also doing a set of cardio or core cardio these routines also have a lot of hopping and lunging that is difficult when your legs are already fried i hate it but it is getting results n nalso the 10 minute title is misleading as others have said while 10 minutes is great if it s all the time you have you need to do at least 2 routines a day to get any fast results the program recommends 3 a day if you can manage it n ni will say that i like the program overall and i am seeing definite results after doing 2 a days for the last 3 weeks however it is getting repetitive and i would recommend splitting the cost with a friend or loved one as the price is a bit steep for what you get
1;2;67;0.8686543406398087;i bought this package a little over two months ago and finally decided to write up a review for it just a little background about myself i did exercise on p90x for about a year about three times a week in the past however after recovering from surgery a few months ago i ve stopped exercising but decided to get back in shape p90x was good but a bit too hardcore for my body at that time hence i decided to give tmt ten minute trainer a try my review and suggestions are based upon my own experience it works for me but may not work for you but i hope you find it somewhat helpful n nfirst i suggest you set a goal and see if you have to lose weight and how much you need to lose by either talking to your doctor or calculate your bmi google it index bmi is not 100 accurate of telling how much weight you need to maintain to stay healthy but would give you a good overall picture of what needs to be done again use it as a general guidance of what your weight goal should be n nnow the title of the product is tmt or ten minute training it s not exactly 10 minutes is all you need to invest per day you need to include warm up and cool down along with the 10 minute exercising so the whole package is roughly 30 minutes per round i call this per round is just because that would only give you the minimum result in order to get the maximum result you need to do three rounds a day with a mix of different exercise routines for example for one day your package might include total body abs and yoga flex you can do the minimum of total body but considering how much can you achieve in 10 minutes would not be much some of the exercises are a bit chanlleging to some new joiners especially if you have n t done any routine exercise for a while so you must let you body adjust to it first what that means is you probably want to stay off by doing one routine at the beginning for about a week or even two weeks if you keep the consistency i guarantee your body will start to adjust to it then perhaps you can do two routines per day you can either do it one in the morning and one at night doing two routines at the same time may not be a great idea at the beginning especially some requires a high bit of cardio exercise the whole idea is do n t push yourself too hard at the beginning your body is not a robot and need time to adjust to the workout system for me after 6 weeks of the program i do one cardio in the morning boy that feels good after all the sweating and two routines usually a yoga abs or something else at night doing cardio in the morning will keep yourself really energetic throughout the day you might feel a bit sore and tired at the beginning but you will quickly adjust to it n nit s important to set a workout goal let s say make a commitment to let your body burn in the first two weeks but only limited to doing only one routine a day but on the 3rd or 4th week you need to increase one more routine that makes two routines per day then eventually three a day no matter what do n t give yourself any excuse do n t delay do n t slack off you will feel the difference finally when you do three routines you are not far from your goal to reduce weight feel much healthier and feel great after all your friends and family will notice too if there are certainly day not days in a row that you do n t feel like working out or just totally burned out from work skip it but do watch the video anyway this way your mind set is still exercising and not letting this commitment fall behind your head gradually n naside from exercising there are some keypoints that should go hand in hand with the program here are what i can think of n nwhen to do your routine n nmorning after you wake up sip a little of water do a cardio then move on with your daily activities drink another glass or two of water after the exercise it s important to keep yourself hydrated it s important not to drink iced or cold water luke warm water is the best since it can quickly hydrate your body system and cause less shock to your internal organs n nevening roughly one hour after dinner do a mix of other routines other than cardio again keeping yourself hydrated is important your muscle will need it too no iced water no soda taboo no energy drinks need just good old water that s all you need you might feel a little hungry after workout it s perfectly to have a serving of food such as an apple berries but please no pasta or anything that has much carbs that will totally defeat the purpose of the program n nwater i ca n t stress it enough that it s important to keep your hydrated all the time especially after the workout you should drink water whenever possible and do n t wait until you get thirsty water also helps you get rid off the junks from your body it will flush away the bad stuff from sweat urine and poop too n nsleep try to get at least 8 hours of sleep and get up early 7 to 8 hours would be ideal n ndiet no more junk food i know it s hard but the more processed food you consume the more negativity you ll bring to your body and negate the purpose of the tmt or any workout i found anything that contains sugar msg and saturated fat are extremely bad for our diet if you have to buy processed food be sure to check the label and see how much sugar salt and carbs they contain remember you are what you eat n nrecommended daily diet n1 whole apple one to two a day it s a great snack to eat after exercising n2 green tea always get the powder not the one with leafs mix green tea powder with luke warm water so you wo n t destroy the nutrients within green tea is a great drink to help get rid of the body junks and contains a lot of vitamins if you used to have energy drink consider switching to green tea it s cheap and easy to make why not you can get green tea powder in most japanese and chinese supermarkets look at the label of production country japan makes the best green tea powder taiwan is the second and stay away from other countries production n3 try to stay away from starchy food such as pasta rice and white bread those things contains lots of sugar and carbs which of course negate or slow down your tmt efforts n4 eat less meat especially red meat try to substitute poultry with fish fish oil is good salmon is the best n5 do n t need to waste your money on organic food most so called organic food you get from the supermarket are hardly organic wholly besides organic food are only good when they are first picked and eaten within the first couple of hours if you want true organic food grow your own n6 breakfast is important whereas dinner is the least important in my opinion of course for breakfast have some oatmeal which is contains much fiber and vitamin and can curb your hunger for many hours be sure to buy the kind you need to cook not instant eat a relatively heavier lunch rather than dinner as you still have to do much physical activities during the day n nokay here s the summary for the tmt n ngood a bit challenging at the beginning but not too hard overall i m a 46 year old and have absolutely no problem catching up after the initial two weeks burn in period tony is a good trainer and gives you a lot of good advice during the routines the two set dvds include total body lower body abs yoga flex and cardio and the package even comes with the elastic band it s a good value n nbad annoying commercials it pops out before and after every workout but you can fast foward or skip them also not sure why they ca n t put all workouts into one dvd i have to keep on switch dvds which is a pain unless you have more than one dvd player these are the major reaons i did n t give it a 5 star n nwell that s about it i hope my lenghty nagging review would be helpful to some of you if you like my review please rate it if not do n t say anything just kidding send me any questions or comments i welcome them all i might add more comments and edit this review from time to time
2;19;76;0.8542021032643007;as a working mom of a busy toddler most of my spare time is spent agonizing over cloth vs disposable and the finer culinary points of hot dogs there is little time for a solid workout 10 minute trainer is the solution to flabby arms the spare tire and the continuous mommy butt that extends from your mid thighs to the small or your back n nthis workout is not for the weak before childbirth bc i was a runner logging over 30 miles a week i do n t look like the after shots but i m in reasonably good shape this workout kicks my butt i feel like i ve worked out when i m finished and i sweat like a 300 pound construction worker on a summer day in miami if you re new to working out you may only be able to do one workout at a time do n t get discouraged you ll be amazed at how quickly you ll adjust n nthe bands are a must if you outgrow you first band never fear the stiffer band will kick your butt again i m not a huge fan of the door thing since i do n t have a door to use it on but it does work n nthis is n t exactly a weight loss product unless you follow the meal guide but it s an amazing fitness product the meal guide is good if you think the food pyramid includes a quarter pounder with cheese but if that s your mo there are plenty of other cookbooks and diet plans on the market that will give you better options for low calorie meals we get it beachbody a banana is low fat and celery nets negative calories n noverall i m loving the workout and honestly i have a crush on tony too overall it s better than 70 a month at my local y working out next to spandex guy grunting girl and the 80 lb 16 year old texting on the elliptical
3;25;39;0.8457757446975483;i bought the 10 minute workout simply because i knew there was no way i could do anything nearly approaching p99x or any of the other programs after i had an accidentai come to jesus meeting in a three wall mirrored dressing room this past christmas at a local macy s department store while trying on a shirt although i had lost 30 pounds last year to say the least i was not impressed by the front side and especially back views of my shirtless body simply put i needed work if i ever planned on taking my shirt off in public again i began the program on jan 3rd 13 and have so far lost 14 pounds this program will work but like aa you ve got to work the program and watch your diet if you do the exercises you will begin to see your body change they are not easy at all and the first couple of weeks is brutal with the yoga and especially the abs trainer i would recommend this 10 minute trainer highly only if you have the dedicated will power to do it every day no matter what i ve slowly gotten in better shape and am now doing two of the suggested three daily 10 minute workouts i might add as a bonus i have strengthened my core and ab muscles and stretched and turned my body to the point that a near crippling case of spinal stenosis i ve had for the past three years is becoming a minor nuisance instead of a major problem as i was literally on the verge of spinal fusion and figured this program was about 95 000 cheaper and gave it a chance do n t waste your time if you are not going to take it seriously you can still get plenty of exercise bike riding running or even walking but if you truly want to get back in those old skinny clothes again and regain twice as much energy as you ve had in years i 100 percent say go for it you wo n t be disappointed unless you quit
4;94;68;0.8402525547925377;my son finished p90x last summer and it transformed his already athletic body to a muscular athletic body n i tried some of the exercises on the p90x and if you have the stenima and dedication to the program this works without a doubt tony does know what he is doing it is just a matter of your dedication to his programs nthe same is being said for the 10 min workout so far we had just conquered week one the workouts are intense but every work out even abs will get you sweating before the 10 min are up ni read from a few reviewers that they posted how hard the program is even for someone who works out regularly to this i would like to say i am not someone who works out regularly but someone who has 10 more pounds to loose i have been watching my calorie fat intake and mainly how much i eat and having lost 20 pds in 1 year i know i need to incorporate exercise to loose those 1o pounds and to also stay at my current weight yes the workout will leave you unless you are a work out pro gasping for air your heart rate will be up and you will be sweating but the program is do able for everyone who puts their mind on wanting it to work tony does a fantastic job of encouraging you and on the trainer track gives you many hint on how to modify the exercises when you are a beginner like me 44 yrs nwe are currently doing the 10 min work out and hopefully next week on a few days will commit to 20 min nhonestly the best 10 20 you can dedicate to doing some exercise every day to get you the heart rate going and sweat definitly my choice over running 5 miles a day for an hours etc nhope this review helped n noh one thing i wanted to mention is that even on the pic it shows 5 dvd s my package came with 2 but it actually works better as you do not constantly have to switch out dvd s
5;97;53;0.8336625605383222;i wo n t go into a long detailed review but i will say that this system is working great for me i had been working out in a gym about 2 3 times a week for a year when i had to give up my membership fees for more important bills after about 7 months of no exercise i noticed all my body parts turning into gelatin i needed to do something but did n t want to join another gym i looked at doing the p90x workouts but was n t ready to pay the high price when i was n t sure if i d even like working out at home then i came across the 10 minute trainer it was a price i was willing to pay after two weeks of doing three workouts per day i went shopping for new clothes and could already see the difference in my abs and legs n ni was n t looking to drop several pounds and i am already a very healthy eater so i did n t do the diet plan that comes with the videos also i do n t consider myself a beginner but i did find the workouts challenging i m on my third week and i am just now able to do some excercises i could n t do in the beginning and there are still others i am continuing to work on i see this as a bonus as it gives me something to work towards and makes my results more gratifying when i am noticing the moves get easier i can feel every excercise work as i am doing i actually feel like i work harder and sweat more in thirty minutes of ten minute trainer than when i would spend an hour and a half at the gym i like tony he s not cheesy or annoying but goofy enough to keep your mind off what you are doing n nmy only cons are much the same as others n1 the advertisements after watching the videos once or twice i figured out when to fast forward but it s still a little annoying to have to do some of the other work outs advertised look interesting so i have watched them to get an idea for future work outs i might want to try when i plateau on tmt n2 seperate videos all the workouts are on two dvd s and when doing the workout plan that the set comes with i am constantly have to switch them out although it does give me a minute to rest and catch my breath in between n nall in all the cons are not enough to keep me from working out or make me regret my purchase i still highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to tone up and get back in shape if your are too out of shape already
6;16;43;0.8115596164945433;i ordered tony horton s 10 minute trainer almost a year ago after seeing an infomercial on tv i had been looking to get back into shape but was worried about time the 10 minute idea sounded really interesting to me i ordered it and decided to follow the program and see what happened n ni should say that the workout calender really calls for 3 10 minute workouts a day to be most effective and there is also short warm up and cool downs so it s not exactly 10 minutes but it s close i decided to follow the calender and do the 3 workouts a day exactly how it said so technically i was doing about 30 35 mins of workout most days n nwith that said i did see incredible results between day 10 and 14 i noticed my pants started feeling a little loose around my waist and that did it for me that was the moment that i realized that it was working and motivated me to keep going i was only 15 20 lbs over weight at the time but i wanted to change i was losing 1 2 lbs a week doing this program obviously eating right is very very important as well you do n t have to eat perfect but you need to clean your diet up and make healthier choices n ntrust me though when you start seeing results you wo n t have the cravings to eat that junk anymore i have moved on to more extreme workouts now but i can credit this program to getting me back into working out and on a healthier path highly recommend
7;29;37;0.7217152198849783;what they do n t tell you until you order is you will get better results if you do 20 to 30 minutes and order more work out routines the problem i had as an older person is i could n t actually get safely into many of the positions since i have mild arthritis since they do n t provide alternative or progressive movements you do n t get results in 10 minutes you get frustated the resistances bands are too short for a tall person and made of cheap materials when i returned the system i did n t even keep them even though this is allowed i am a 5 8 female with years of exersizing experience on my own with machines and using videos i ll stick to denise austin pilates the best exercise is one you can actually do and will continue to do nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href 10 minute trainer tony horton s workout for the busiest people fitness dvd program dp b0016pwg7s ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 10 minute trainer tony horton s workout for the busiest people fitness dvd program a
8;115;26;0.6963960630734596;this workout is everything i needed but condensed down into 10 minute workouts perfect for always on the go mothers i ve seen really good results with this program n ni recently had another child so i was eager to get my body back again i did n t realize how out of shape i was until i popped this dvd in and began my workout boy was i sweating my butt off in just 10 minutes what how could this be i ve been to the gym to workout for over an hour but never again i m telling you this really does work and the time goes by so quickly we all have 10 minutes in the day i started this workout in june and i have lost 29lbs thus far n ni wanted to try insanity but my back injury just would n t allow for all those movements this is also a beginner level for those who are trying to get back into shape n na must buy
9;55;17;0.6719596729996044;i ordered this straight from beachbody and was enrolled in a monthly subscription that i asked not to be enrolled in they quickly charged my card but i did n t get the product for a week and a half this should n t surprise me since the rep yawned through our entire conversation when i was ordering it once i finally got the order they did n t include the band yeah another week to wait for that n nso i m finally ready to work out hmmmm i do n t seem to have a door in the middle of a room with plenty of area to workout with the band so that s a big problem also there are only three videos which i was under the impression i was getting a whole set for that price well let s begin and see how it goes wow tony has to be one of the most annoying people i ve ever seen i found that turning him way down and putting on music that i liked helped a bit but then i of course was missing what he was saying plus he seems to be doing some moves that i clearly remember from other videos that were a big no no because they can cause injuries i m only 40 and in good shape but my knees and back were not happy with me during and after these workouts n ni ll be sending this product back i ve had much more success with my jillian michaels 30 day shred i was just looking to add variety but i ll find something else
10;50;24;0.6425364591745407;ok this is a really great workout for those of us with only 10 to 30 minutes to spare that is indisputable will take time to learn the moves they go fast but be aware you need to have a heavy duty door wiyh 3 hinges opposite your tv if you d o not research you options before you buy this so you can use the door anchor resistence bands thats not very clear when ordering i had to order another dvd player for my bedroom because i do n t have any doors or any way to anchor yhe bands and watch the video in my family room 3 hinge doors that lock like a front door as the product insists that you use are not commonly located in perfect position in front of a tv i have to jerry rig to mine which they do not want you to do
11;76;14;0.6044928842046643;i m sorry but this is not worth the money i returned it after 2 weeks i was stacking 3 workouts and that means doing the same workout over and over very boring if you do n t have a door close to where you workout forget using the extra resistance yes you can do most without it but it makes the workout less intense his upper body workout does not even give you modifiers if you can not use the resistance band so you have to make up your own the exercise band in the program comes in 3 pieces that you have to snap together mine kept unsnapping during the exercises which could lead to serious injury the girls doing the exercises were good but tony was annoying often talking about sitting home smoking a cigarette not very motivating in my book if this was priced at 19 99 i might have kept it but no way for close to 100
12;100;15;0.5711817120669811;i have lost 17lbs in my first 18 days and am amazed at just how my heart rate gets up and my muscles are sore from 10 30 min a day i would recommend it to anyone with a busy life like myself i work full time nights and full time as a wife and mom during the day but with this i can do it and get success

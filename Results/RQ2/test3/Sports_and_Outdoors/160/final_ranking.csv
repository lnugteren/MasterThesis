0;55;54;0.9302045890716721;this is a long and complete review if you read no further know this this thing is really great well made good performance and a ton of fun will it replace my car as a main mode of transportation of course not its just a fun vehicle to ride around on its very quiet and makes for a peaceful ride especially with the knee controller and having my upper body completely free its like magically gliding around effortlessly n ni ride it in my neighborhood and on local bike trails that go through the woods mn law gives the minipro the same rights as an electric wheelchair meaning i can ride on bike trails and pedestrian trails its so quiet ive surprised some wildlife and have been able to get back into the woods of my local parks i would not have been able to do otherwise with my bad knee im over 50 and will need knee replacement at some point with this device i can get outside without having extreme pain after a couple of miles of walking ive owned this for 4 months i resisted the temptation to review it right away wanted to use it for a reasonable amount of time before submitting a review n nhere are some specifics ive seen others address ill give my 2 cents n ncontrol with the stick the control is effortless i do n t even think about the stick its just lean and go im a 6 tall fat guy so i prefer to keep the stick height at the lowest level and it contacts my legs just below the knee you can adjust as needed when at home i store it near the rear of my garage so i have to slalom around bikes and stuff to get it to the charger it responds like a dream n nspeed after a very short training period the speed limit is set to 10 6 mph i have not found this to be a problem but i admit every once in a while it beeps at me and leans me back as i exceed this limit this is usually on long straight flat areas where you feel really comfortable thus you tend to want to go faster you get used to the limit after a while and its not a big deal but if speed is important to you you might be disappointed that you cant go faster than 10mph see handlebar topic below for more if you think about it gliding at 10mph means you re one big bump away from falling to the pavement at 10mph better than falling at 15mph but certainly i would love to be able to disable the speed warning beeper and if they imcreased the limit to 12 15 mph id love it for street riding n nhandlebars the unit comes with a knee controller for turning control unlike a hoverboard that uses the differential angle between the left and right foot pads for steering the segway has a one piece platform and steering direction is done with the control stick you usually do n t have to think about it as you lean into a turn the stick is nudged my your legs knee and turns the segway for you you can get optional handlebars from third party sellers this makes the minipro act just like a segway pt i bought this thinking i would always use it with my bad knee but it was not the case first having the handlebar installed does make the segway stable and easy too stable and easy so stable and easy that you want to go faster and are constantly hitting the 10mph speed limit second its not as fun using the knee control is a bit more challenging so while i bought the handlebar kit i only use it if a guest wants to try my segway n nstorage i prefer to store it in a heavy duty storage tote i place a carpet remnant that forms a u in the tote allowing for three sides of protection minimal rolling around in the trunk and when i store it people can not see whats in the tote n nthe app the app is good for setup light settings and looking at battery life and speed but other than that not super useful i really do n t care what other riders near me are doing but the app works fine and i can connect my bluetooth earpiece and the bt app at the same time n nbattery so far battery life is great the app gives you a live view into battery performance the unit is advertised to give 14mi per charge ive never drained the battery but based on a simple calculation of having less than 50 battery after a 6 mile ride i would likely not get 14 miles but then again i am over the 220lb weight limit so the segway is clearly working harder when i ride n ncrashes i have ridden full size segways many times including a recent ride for a work outing have to say after riding the minipro riding a regular segway is pretty boring but there are some things to keep in mind the minipro has much smaller wheels so you can not to over large bumps large cracks in the pavement or wide expansion joints the only crash i ever had in 4 months was on day 2 trying to go over a big crack in the sidewalk i have had near crashes this happens when going down a steep incline too fast for some reason my balance goes backwards and i lean in the wrong direction luckily in these cases i was able to hop off the minipro and it glided to a stop and i was on my way n nnight gliding some people commented on why anyone would glide at night except for the occasional bug slapping me in the face night gliding is great i do it in remote areas where i can look at the lake with just the headlights lighting the way the low angle of the light does a very good job of lighting the way really fun n nso in summary its just plain fun i live in mn and will only get to ride this 6 months a year still worth it for me if you can afford it take the leap youll love it

images i b1tp l9xnis mp4 class video url input type hidden name value https images na ssl images amazon com images i a1txfzrvpis png class video slate img url nbsp i just got mine yesterday as a birthday present i m a 48 year old geek i had wanted a full size segway for a long time but could n t justify the expense this one went on sale during amazon s recent prime day bringing the price down to 699 from 999 i thought this one would be a good alternative for that price n nthe item was promised in two days under the prime two day shipping guarantee instead the item arrived in four days i note that in case you are trying to meet a specific deadline for arrival n nit comes in a relatively small box about 2 1 2 feet by 2 1 2 feet very easy to pick up and move around inside the box was a second brown box and inside that was the segway box the segway comes in three parts the wheels and standing platform the knee brace and the accessory box containing the power cord a valve stem extension air inflation hose for the tires quick start instructions regular instructions which did n t include much more information and two replacement discs for the side of the wheels see the red and grey lines in the product picture n ni m techno and sporty so the setup was pretty easy the segway was delivered all charged up so i was riding around in my living room and kitchen within 30 minutes you first need to download the segway app from the apple or android store the instructions seem to indicate this is an absolute requirement i do n t know for sure because i did download and use the app once you do then you need to register your segway using the app then you need to pair your segway to the app mine had difficulty making and keeping a bluetooth connection between my android s6 and the segway which doubled the setup time then you need to update the firmware for the segway using the app then you need to slide the knee bar into place and tighten the adjustment knob no tools required setup is then complete n nthe instructions are not really helpful for example after installing the knee bar it says you should adjust the bar to desired height but it does not tell you what height it should be in other words where should the bar be located below your knees low on your knees even on your knees above your knees it does n t say both instruction books are that simple and basic i should note that the knee bar easily adjusts up or down with the twist of a knob no tools required n nthe instructions listed some limitations that i should note because they are not apparent in the sales literature it says the riders must be between 85 185 pounds 40 85 kg and must be 4 3 to 6 6 130 200 cm tall 185 pounds is not that heavy for a normal adult american male i am 183 and the segway seemed to operate fine but be aware of that limitation it also said that the device is only for people between 16 and 60 years old given that i feel i am quickly approaching 60 that limitation bugged me a little bit my tiny 4 0 tall eight year old daughter rode it just fine but the manual says she should n t get to ride it try telling her that the bar did stick high up in her crotch but she was able to control it on a level concrete surface just fine my 11 year old athletic boy was riding it like a pro within five minutes of getting on it the instructions also go over a long list of stuff you should n t ride over basically it wants you to stick to level concrete i have to admit hitting a speed bump or hole or even a slightly raised bit of concrete would cause some balance issues but it is a limitation you should keep in mind and is not that big of an issue if you have good balance i should note that you re not supposed to let the segway get wet in any way including riding through puddles that could be a problem if you live somewhere with a lot of frequent rain n nafter the setup is complete and you ve read the instruction manuals it is time to step on the segway it is neat because when the power is on the segway automatically balances itself when the power goes off it turns on its side like a robot would that just lost power the segway app takes you through a training program during this program the speed is limited to 4 3 mph 7 km h you have to go forward and backward and turn around in a complete circle both left and right then you have to ride for 10 meters it is kind of like the setup routine at the beginning of halo on the xbox if you re familiar with that game the tutorial is then complete n ni took my segway outside and completed the setup by riding on a level concrete street for 0 6 miles 1 km if you have to move the segway by hand you have to pick it up using the knee pads bar there is another plastic bar that can be pulled out of the top of the knee bar if you need to steer the device without riding it this option was okay but a little awkward it was easier to just pick it up if it needed to be moved short distances n nduring the first 0 6 miles the speed was limited to 6 2 mph 10 km h after that distance was complete i was able to disable the speed limitation using the app and reach the maximum speed of 10 mph 16 km h within an hour of opening the box i was riding full speed on both a level and hilly concrete street with no feeling of uneasiness i was also able to go up and down a sloped gravel driveway and across grass at a slow speed n nthe app lets me set the speed limit for the segway customize the color of the rear light bars turn on or off the front and rear lights and activate remote control mode the app and instructions are not helpful about figuring out how to set and change the lights trial and error is what i have done so far the remote control mode did n t seem to work very well the segway would n t move forward or back in response to my remote commands just turn in a circle but i have n t played with it a lot yet n nwhen riding the segway will start to lean backwards on its own if you hit the maximum speed for more than a few seconds that bothers me a little bit because it throws off my balance especially if i m leaning forward to go up a hill or leaning backwards already to go down a hill however i did n t fall down n nthe wheels have a little notch to them to help when riding over anything but level concrete but they are not really intended to go off road short even grass or level dirt or small sized gravel would be the most i would venture to ride over with these tires n noverall i am very pleased with the segway as my daughter excitedly said it is the best thing since sliced bread she declared after seeing it that she will never walk anywhere again i agree it looks like it will be a lot of fun in the right locations i think i would still like to have the handlebar of a full size segway particularly when going over rough terrain or obstacles but this was 10 of that price so i got what i paid for plus it has n t caught fire like other hover boards and i trust this manufacturer so i am not really worried about that particular problem
2;54;53;0.906058509995602;very mixed experience here i rode a friend s one time and so much fun that i simply had to buy one i did a lot of research first and i found most of the reviews to be fairly accurate compared to my experience in both the positive and negative aspects so i ll go over a few of the more important ones on both sides n ninitial impression was that it seems to be a case of mostly great engineering design a few clear exceptions noted below with serious concerns about poor quality control and or manufacturing processes it s brilliant in many ways it is as smooth as riding on a cloud and the controls are intuitive and easy enough that i felt extremely fluid and graceful after only a little practice on the other hand it feels cheap and fragile in many ways n nthe wheels and wheel covers feel cheaply made and too reliant on flimsy plastic giving it an air of fragility n nthe part where the steering knee bar attaches to the base is not very securely fastened and the friend s that i had rode to test it out was already broken in that spot so that it kept falling out and it made me a little wary to begin with before i d even decided to place my order n nthe height adjustment for the knee bar is secured by a simple screw that could easily get worn out or stripped and become worthless if you are not gentle with it do not pick it up at the top by the knee bars pick it up from the base or this will likely happen quickly n nthose orange and grey screw covers that look like spokes also just pop right off very easily if you hit a bump there is nothing to really make them secure they just snap into place and the plastic is a little flexible so they definitely will pop out sooner or later unless you keep it under 2 mph and never go over a bump most of the time i noticed when they fell off and i could go back for them but i still lost two in my wake on the first day the grey one was a hopeless search after dusk burning through the supply of replacements in a matter of hours n ni started to notice that it was odd that they were mostly popping off one side after riding for a while longer i also began to notice that it seemed a little uneven in the way it rode over bumps which i do n t think i could have notice until i started to get really comfortable on it well i put 2 2 together and i inspected the tires and sure enough one was flat yes after just my initial tutorial phase and within my first couple miles of riding on paved streets i had already gotten a flat i m not sure if it was even under pressure out of the box because i did n t think to check the tire pressure before riding it i had decided to take it out for a long ride to break it in so i was about a mile from my house when i discovered the flat fortunately the tires have pretty rigid sidewalls and i could have been riding for a while before i noticed the flat and it did n t seem dramatically worse on that side n nnot wanting to mess it up any worse i walked it home after i discovered the flat which i also discovered to be a total weak point and another design flaw the pull out handle is nice but is too short so if you are pulling it behind like a typical rolling carrier bag your heels will get clipped repeatedly unless you hold it far out to your side which is of course awkward and makes it hard to control n non something of a side note the app seems to be a massive battery killer bluetooth the main culprit i guess my phone battery went dead faster from monitoring the speed than the minipro did carrying my 200 lb frame around it also seemed a bit rough a few bad instances of engrish in the menus like a hastily developed translation adaptation of the original ninebot app and it deserves a facelift update n nthe speed limiter is a reasonable and understandable safety feature to have but it is extremely annoying and i do n t think it is well implemented and actually creates more danger than it prevents due to this instead of simply limiting your top speed it actually tilts itself backward when you exceed the speed limit and this has been the only thing that has caused me to fall off i was riding at top speed and about to make a turn when it kicked in and leaned back pulling the knee bar out from between my knees so i could n t really steer at the crucial moment i needed to in order to negotiate the turn smoothly i had to quickly lean back and try to steer and knocked the knee bar causing it to go into a clumsy speed wobble that sent me off and to the ground pro tip if you think you might crash just hop off do n t try to ride it out or try to step off and back on like a skateboard because it will probably go a bit wonky if you shift your weight on and off like that it will balance itself so unless it heading straight into an obstacle it will just harmlessly roll to a stop remaining upright i was n t injured or anything but it would n t have happened without that speed limiter function hopefully future firmware updates will address this and improve the implementation preferably they would just let us override this feature i ll sign a waiver and or void my warranty by loading cracked firmware if that is what it will take it really should be optional or at least let us set disable the way it leans back and slows you down i d settle for a simple top speed hard line if you could just hold that speed without fighting it back and forth as it is the best thing to do is try to get very close to the limit and hold a steady pace right there to avoid it kicking in but that is tricky especially up and down hills of any size and requires concentration as well it would be better if you could simply hit max speed and just be in cruise control mode at a steady rate n nriding it around in public will definitely draw lots of attention which is a combination of added fun you will leave a broad swath of smiles in your wake and also obviously a bit of annoyance since it can be a distraction and not everyone is making friendly comments on the positive side i rode up to a store and the cute girl at the door of store greeted me with a smile and said well hello man from the future but you also get a lot of weird stares and asinine comments about making sure that you do n t blow yourself up or catch on fire when the battery explodes i m already really tired of explaining that it is not the same thing as the hoverboards that have had those problems n nso while i remain heavily skeptical about the durability and reliability of these i still really think it is a great product that i want in my life so i ve sent mine back and once the refund is processed i will give it another shot and i will update my review accordinglyif everything goes ok with the process and the new one is ok then i ll definitely need to up this to a 4 star
3;93;92;0.8914468258516627;death machine beware years ago i did a tour on the older full sized x terra segway and it was an absolute joy even being an amputee lost my left leg below the knee it was a comfortable ride and totally fun this however is a far different story as i could not do the ride without the add on handle bar stem option i bought that as well n nthis made the device highly unstable and it would launch on it s own take off from under my feet and i have bruises and was left bloodied after a single ride n nthe i phone holder on the top of the handle bar stem is crap as i took one of many falls it let my 800 00 s phone fly for yards it s only the wonderful shock case that saved it each time frankly i m astounded it did not crack the screen after that ordeal n nthe ride is very poor and stiff the steering is barely adequate to avoid being crushed by oncoming cars even in quiet back roads n nanother most dangerous problem is that when you exceed the 10mph speed limit governor the device slows you down enough to make you be thrown off or not be able to steer in a traffic situation it would have been smart to be able to set the limiter to the 10 mph mark and easily avoid that issue n ninstead you can set a so called speed limiter that wo n t allow you to reach more than 6 or 7 miles per hour instead of enjoying the available 10mph the device is capable of n nthe device did weird moves unpredictable take offs and easily broke that every turn not to mention parts falling off n nby the time i got to a store only 1 mile away i had 3 nasty tumbles due to these issues and was nearly run over several times by drivers who simply do n t care not the devices fault there but it s a real situation you should be aware of riding this gadget n nand although the full fledged segways even used ones will cost you 3 to 4 thousand dollars to start with this thing still costs 600 to 700 00 and is a piece of garbage n non my way home i was utterly terrified i would end up in the emergency room or worse n nabsolutely without a doubt the very worst riding experience of my entire life n ndo yourself a favor stay as far away from this awful contraption as you can and please do n t let your child talk you into getting them one
4;31;30;0.8859768092409537;this is a really fun unit and i hate to do this but i m going to return it because segway s customer service just told me that if you have a flat tire you will void the warranty if you replace the tire not that they sell spares anyhow folks replacing the tire does not involve removing the wheel assembly and is something that will be required on any product with air filled tired whether it be a bicycle car or anything else imagine buying a bike and being told that replacing the tire yourself voids the warranty and that you have to return the entire unit to get a new tire the unit does n t even come with good tires but some unknown name with no slime or anything else to protect it replacement tires are available abroad and they apparently sell quite a few of them but i m not going to mess around with paying high delivery charges duties language barriers etc i ll send this back and let segway deal with it if they ever learn to support this product maybe i ll reconsider n nthis is a fun toy and is exactly as described but i ca n t see this having any real use as a transportation device for most people an electric bicycle would be a much better choice to go short distances to go to work or run errands i ve only used this for about 3 miles so if i change my mind i ll update this i weigh 170 and am 6 1 so i m within the specs n npros easy to learn to control i do n t see any problem with the controls being reversed when you re going backwards that s the way everything else is getting off is quite easy the only thing that is a bit hard is getting on since mine at least goes back when you first put on foot on it even though i m careful not to touch the control bar i m hoping that i ll get used to getting on quickly n ni actually like the tutorial and appreciate the fact that it makes you use it a bit before unlocking the speed i m really not trying to kill myself i ve gotten it up to full speed about 10 5 mph and unlike many others i see why it s limited to this speed if you were going uphill or downhill and you were going much faster the motors would not be able to compensate and you d fall flat on your face even if there was a release that you had to click to allow you to overcome the speed limit it would n t keep ninebot from being sued by the pedestrians you would hit n nit seems to be sturdy and well built i guess time will tell n ncons n nmy unit came with the tires only inflated to about 26 psi hopefully everyone checks their tires and makes sure they re at 40 50 psi since underinflated tires will strain the motors n nspare parts may be an issue i ca n t imagine that the tires wo n t have to be replaced fairly often and sending it back each time is n t an option something like slime would fix a small leak but ninebot needs to get its act together and have spares and other parts listed on their web site n nthis thing is heavy i m in pretty good shape and i can lift it with no problem but there s no way you could lift this for any distance on stairs entering and leaving subways etc and getting it up four or flights of steps in a new york walk up would kill you n nninebot s instructions could be better for example when you charge it and all the 5 bars are lite it is not fully charged you have to wait until the lights start flashing and the led on the charged turns green or in my case an orange color that s not really intuitive so they should have been more detailed n nanyhow for a toy it s fun and certainly different just hope it does n t end up gathering dust i ve placed an order for a hand handlebar made specifically for the minipro being sold by a store in dc when it comes in i ll give that a try and see if it makes this more useful although by doing that it wo n t be able to stand on it s own when it s not being ridden anymore

7;83;82;0.8498074147839438;i bought this for myself for christmas 2016 mainly cause i was always late for work now i m late to work a lot faster lol from the get go i did n t know how to ride one of these things but right out of the box after syncing it up with an app on your phone there is a driving course that teaches you how to ride it i d say it took me around 45 mins to comfortably get it down it is now june 4th and i have long since got comfortable with riding it but now the battery is at the point where i almost have to charge it everyday but that was expected at some point but there are a lot of factors brought it to this point nfor one i weight 200 lbs another is that i usually ride it as fast as it ll let me both of which drain the battery pretty fast i mainly use it to and from work i m also carrying a shoulder bag that possibly weighs another 15 lbs or so i d guess that if i was 125 or 150 lbs the battery would have lasted a lot longer speaking of battery i tried ordering a battery replacement and they ve been out of stock for a while so that s another thing to take into consideration if i do n t get a replacement battery soon this thing will be sitting in my apt till i can get one and batteries are pretty pricey a lithium battery for segway minipro 240wh goes for 150 and a lithium battery for segway minipro 310wh for 295 both of which are sold out so that is one thing that i ll have to take into consideration is that if the battery is only going to last for roughly five months will it be worth it replacing the battery every five months but other than that i love riding it around town n nupdate addition as i mentioned in my above comment for the past several weeks i ve noticed that the battery seemed to be dying faster and that the segway felt like it was slowing down or felt that it had lack of power that it used to have well today i was waiting in a crosswalk heading back to work when a man next to me told me that my left tire was flat or pretty low i could n t tell from above but that made sense now for the past couple of weeks i noticed it was making like a rubbing sound and several of the color covers fell off nwhen i got to work i had a friend help me fill them with air he had a tire gauge and checked both tires and they were both pretty low we filled them close to the suggested psi and when i got back on and rode just a very short distance i could feel a big difference and since then i could feel it going a lot smoother so this is a possibility of why the battery was dying faster it was working extra hard to transport a 200 lb man on really low almost flat tires so now i m investing in a tire gauge and check the air pressure regularly and it looks like if the plastic color covers start falling off it seems like it might be a sign that the tires are low since they ll end up pushing on the little color plastic covers but still it s a good idea to regularly check the air pressure in the tires from time to time since i put air back in the tires it feels 100 better a lot smoother nupdate 6 28 17 i do n t know why but ca n t find a battery replacement for this segway anywhere online that s one thing to take into consideration since the original battery will eventually die it is the most expensive item to replace on this machine so you d think they would have replacement batteries but i have yet to find where to find one so i suggest by the time you re looking to buy this machine first look to see if there is some site to where they sell battery replacements for this machine
8;160;159;0.846729469066725;i will start by saying i am an over the road driver and there are times where i may either finish my day early or may shut down somewhere cool on the weekend and although i have a bicycle that i keep strapped to my headboard to ride to somewhat keep me in shape what about those tines where i do n t want to get all sweaty and stuff right this mini pro was my solution of a few other transportation devices n nmy intentions called for 15 mph portable under 35lbs can run at least 12 14miles and is somewhat weather water resistant i was downed to a toss up between the m5 push scooter which i was certainly going to buy until this thing popped up n ni have never ridden a hoverboard style device so this is new territory for me i am 187lbs and is more of a casual driving type of person this thing is ok to me ive read all the reviews and articles i could find on this mini pro before purchasing and everything seemed pretty legit for the most part i like everything about it n ntwo things i do n t like about it n low top speed n the constant interruptions it leaning back to slow you down of my riding when approaching or driving the governed speed limit n ni ve seen so many complaints about this and i can understand why ninebot did that but the firmware is too aggressive the constant notifications telling you about the speed warnings are also pointless and annoying could n t there be an disclaimer that an owner can agree to that will allow them to ride without all of the speed interruptions where if they got hurt while exceeding the intended limits the rider will be fully reliable these are the problems i have with it battery life seems pretty good as i ve driven mine about 4 3miles and still have 73 battery life left driven along a mostly flat route and i am 187lbs i drove it in minnesota 15 18mph winds against the wind and could n t seem to get it to go over 4 5mph just so y all know
9;51;50;0.8199626186700995;pardon the saga but i think it is important for you to know what a simple flat tire that came from the company will entail this is an example of the flawed design with the tire that requires the unit to be sent back we will all get a flat tire at some point and the repair process is far from convenient and will take over 2 weeks from start to finish to complete n nmy experience n nthe unit that was delivered to me had both tires under inflated at 14 psi i attempted to fill them both and one tire took air to 38 psi and the other tire went completely flat 45 psi is in the manual and the technician said it should leave the manufacturer with i went online and filled out a contact us link the email response that was sent to me directed me to the wrong segway department that department was unable to provide me with the proper contact information i googled more info and reached a woman sallie who stated that i needed to call someone else and gave me that number i called that number and spoke to a gentleman john who i had to explain my story to again and then he sent me a word document via email that i had to fill out and attach back to the mail as well as take a picture of the serial number on the unit and attach that picture to the email the serial was already a required field on the word document after i sent the word document back i received an email stating that i was to call another number to setup a return of the unit the wheels have a motor in them so you can not just replace a tire or an inner tube the entire unit must be returned to fix a flat tire after calling the number given to me in my return email i reached a lady who strangely enough was the same lady sallie who sent me on this goose chase 2 days earlier after i gave her the rma number she asked me if i wanted to fix it myself or send the entire unit back i told her that i would be happy to fix it myself but the technician stated i would have to send the entire unit back she said oh ok and she would send me instructions on how to send it back and that i had to follow the instructions very carefully as fedex would not accept it if i did not i inquired if fedex would pick up the unit and she stated i would need to pack it up and drive to a fedex and drop it off there when i explained that i had received a damaged unit and i felt it appropriate for them to have fedex pick it up at my house to minimize the further inconvenience sallie said that i could see if fedex would come to my house and that i could pay for them to if they did i told her that the service i had received so far was horrible and that if segway would not accommodate having fedex pick up at my house i would just return the unit for a refund to amazon and cut my loss sallie simply stated i m sorry you feel that way that s it no let me see what i can do no i m sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you nothing sallie could not have cared less whether i was a satisfied customer or not i m sorry for segway that she is their customer facing agent n nso n1 service request via the web contact us link n2 return email saying i contacted the wrong department n3 phone call to the number given to me n4 reached the incorrect department apparently who gave me new phone number n5 called technician n6 technician sends an email that requires to be filled out and reattached you will need to print fill and scan back in if you don t have word installed n7 fill out form and had to take a picture of serial number sticker on unit although the form requires that info already n8 emailed that form back n9 recieved an email telling me to call a different number n10 called that number said she wants to speak with the technician n11 process ended when sallie was unwilling to provide basic customer service n12 returned the unit to amazon the easiest part of this process thank you amazon n nbecause you will get a flat tire at some point during the product life buyer beware i hope that sharing my horrible customer service experience will save you the same type of hassle save your money it s going to have to go back anyways
10;14;13;0.8070678381337308;i thought this item was the answer to all my short distance transportation needs until my right tire started leaking of course i encounter this problem after the 90 day return window on amazon i ve emailed segway about this issue and they had two solutions 1 take it to a bike shop and hope they can help you or 2 fill it with green slime and hope that works n nbuyers beware do your homework before purchasing this expensive piece of junk the actual build quality and functionality is wonderful the item performs very well but once you get a flat good luck trying to fix it i just ca n t believe with the amount of money you invest in this equipment there is no easy fix for something as simple as a leaking tire the leak was n t cause by a puncture it has to do with the sealing around the tire rim n nyou can not use an inner tube as the tire has none i tried the fix a flat pump option but that does not address the air leaking issue caused by a faulty seal between the wheel rim and tire after hours of research online emailing segway and now i did try to call their main customer service number and got an answering machine i m beginning to feel as all hope is lost n nthis was a huge investment of money not a cheap toy i really wanted this to address some important transportation needs and now i m stuck with a broken unit that will no longer properly function how can the product design be so faulty when it comes to a normal everyday operational component like tires
11;82;81;0.8025918099306626;i received the minipro a few days ago and here are my initial comments nthe product seems to be the quality i would expect from segway nthe setup and unboxing was easy nyou are required to install the segway ninebot app to your phone this will allow you to control and configure your preferences use the remote control register your mini etc nthe app is fairly decent but in my opinion requires additional work once you create your username you can not change it so beware that if you use your email address or your name it will be displayed in the stats along with the other registered users keeping track of your mileage etc ni had trouble getting the tutorial to complete in order to increase the speed limit despite finishing the tutorial several times suddenly the tutorial completed and i still was not able to set the speed beyond 6 2mph after riding for awhile the speed finally unlocked and now the mni is much easier to ride ndue to the light weight of the mini the remote control will not work well unless it is on hard smooth pavement if the mini encounters a small rock or stick it will not be able to overcome the obstacle the extension handle works great and the mini is easy to walk beside you noverall i think the mini is great for someone who can not afford the storage space of a large segway i carry this in my rv where storage space is limited n nupdate 7 1 16 nchanging my rating to 5 stars because the mini is a great device despite the quality of the app
12;10;9;0.7741673355131843;corporation have been on the down slide since 2000 and believe that you are not capable of reading a book or watching a how to video we give to much control and the circuits as well as hardware integration that is require to make this happen is very advance at the companies choice they can brick your device making inoperable if they get bought out or no longer support that model being a software engineer this happens are the time i have compared the software that is in the segway and the copy from overseas well when you line up the product side by side everything is identical down to the manufactures of the components pictures will be posted with side by side along with video i took this one step further i had to make several patch cables in order to reviews the encoding and software keys on both devices as i figure the company uses an universal open source with several locks but my 14 year boy could break with an old dos computer with an iso board so the only real difference is some changes to the software to allow the company to have the keys to your life segway why do you need to download peoples call logs messages locations and or trying to activate the camera microphone companies go to far to get your personal information but you know on the android warning that is it suppose to show you all permission that the company require in order to use this product but this is embedded into the coding to automatically do this in the background so segway why is this i do believe you owe people an explanation but i will be posting the tear down videos of both side by side what your advertising is not what we are getting which is misleading the consumer which is illegal
13;19;18;0.7673065606893065;very impressed with this product we are in our mid fifties and this was a breeze to learn to ride perhaps 5 or 10 minutes until you feel fairly comfortable and in a short time after that you are able to maneuver without issue biggest learning tip is to relax when you get on the minipro your instinct is to try to balance on it when what you really want to do is just stand there and relax the segway does the balancing the faster you relax the faster you learn to ride have had grandkids ages 8 11 and 16 on it as well obviously while under supervision in a park and away from danger the 8 year old was the quickest learner and she was amazing on it carries my 201 pounds well and all components feel sturdy and of high quality this is not a cheap product but you ll have a lot of fun with it only suggestion for segway put a camera on it and make the remote bluetooth control capability more fun
14;96;95;0.7487834892338854;amazon suckered me into buying this while it was a prime day deal so far i m glad i did i ve put 10 miles on it far riding around town today and i have enough battery to do 8 more according to its meter i can see why some might want it to go faster but when you consider having to turn and how quick this thing turns more speed would be bad i almost wrecked when a kid got awestruck forgot about the bike he was riding and i had to zig out of the way while doing full speed luckily i was able to one hop out of the spin out for the first time i truly understand why grandpa always wanted the fastest golf cart on the course flying by people pushing strollers or walking dogs and then hearing them go what is that or did you see that is pretty cool a couple times i caught myself thinking i may never walk again if only this thing did stairs a wedge or spinner attachment might also come in handy n n6 month update ni d rate this higher if i could there are few products i could say that about i can honestly say i ride the segway more than i ever imagined i would i ve traveled hundreds and hundreds of miles if i lived somewhere free from snow ice subzero tempts i d have gone twice as far by now i ride this everywhere i can to get my groceries get a meal go to the bar ride the bike trails or the lakes or to find the next great drone video shot as long as i can get there and back again and be under the weight limit i take my segway i ll probably buy a second one soon as a spare just in case this one ever dies on me and they stop selling them that s how much i enjoy it
15;4;3;0.7454941995550692;edit i ve gotten a number of comments regarding this review mainly negative n ni really think this product should be clearly labeled n n online registration required to activate this device n nthe negative comments are a little puzzling because unless they come from segway employees we re really on the same side n nthe company registration n restricts your ability to use the device n restricts your ability to sell your device n will eventually disable it when segway stops supporting it and you do n t have your original phone think 10 years from now when you come back to visit your parents home n rudely invades your privacy they require your email address and probably phone number and whatever other information you provide n non the other hand the safety and security reasons for the restrictions are all fluff n nthere is no reason for registration to run through the training scenario n nthere is also no reason to make theft protection an opt in choice left up to the purchaser n nyou are given no choice in any of these matters in the end the only choice you re given is to send back the device n nsending it back was a hard choice for me it would have been fun on an upcoming family vacation but i think it was the right thing to do n n original review n nyou can not use the segway until you download an app on your phone n nhowever you launch the app and you get a login screen n nyou ca n t use the app until you register with the company n nso you ca n t use this scooter until they give you permission n ni bought this but what did i buy what s with these companies they do n t want to let go and think they can add any restrictions they want for as long as they want n nsorry i m going to return it the segway description does n t mention the restrictions and i do n t go for that kind of stuff i avoid it
16;11;10;0.6999804400656227;let me start by saying that i have never ridden a hover board and i ve only ridden a segway once like 10 years ago on a segway tour so i m not particularly skilled at riding these the first time i stepped onto it i had the wobbles for just few seconds and it took me about 30 seconds to feel secure and trust that it would stay upright within minutes i was feeling pretty confident on it and within the hour it felt as natural as walking it feels really well made and the ride is super smooth i thought the bar in the middle might be difficult or awkward to steer with with but it feels very natural n ni put my roommate on it last night and he had the same experience took him just a couple of minutes to really get settled into it but then he was zipping around too n nthis is easily the best money i have ever wasted on something i do n t need so much fun n nupdate i ve been riding it around for a week now and i love it more and more every day the only three things i ve found that i wish were different are n1 i wish the max speed was just a bit higher as i find myself always getting beeped at when i do n t think i m going all that fast and n2 i wish there some way to easily attach a bike lock the locking feature does n t actually prevent anyone from walking away with it n3 some comfort pads would be nice as i find my feet hurting if i ride for a long period of time n nall in all i still love it though
17;6;5;0.6895775371551813;after few minutes of practice i can quickly ride it around the neighborhood going over the bumps driveways i work 3 miles from home so i rode it to work today it takes me 10 minutes to drive 15 ride the bike and 20 25 minutes with the segway this thing goes uphill effortless going down hill is very easy as well it s amazing i was able to get 7 miles and still have 52 battery left ni like the way the white one work but if i have to choose again i d get the black version as the white one get dirty very quick n n3rd days of ownership still love it it had a creaking noise coming from the join i sent the message to the segway distribution north america within minutes a rep a for shawn called me on his cellphone at 7 00 pm and we were able to fix the noise issue minutes later great customer service
18;9;8;0.6783372413797393;today when i was testing driving minipro in the park it suddenly tilted so far back by itself that i fell off the unit and sprained my ankle upon some investigation the internet forum was filled with complaints about the speed punishment feature that was implemented in recent firmware of minipro what this feature does is that when you drive over the speed limit it will tilt back to force you to slow down the intention is great but so far its implementation is severely flawed the tilting threw many riders off balance and caused them to fall off the unit so this safety feature becomes the very thing that makes minipro unsafe i did n t know about this until i experienced it today and then saw the many complaints online so this unit is going back to amazon i have no interest in a product where i can be injured by its safety feature which is idiotic beyond imagination

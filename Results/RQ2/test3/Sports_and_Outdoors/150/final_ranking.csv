0;1;147;0.736344552812378;on the strength of the advertising i bought 5 of these flashlights for a fantastic discounted price of 75 i should have known it is a scam because the return policy of the company shadowhawkflashlights is 3 8 days the flashlights arrived and the light is no better than my 1990 s bulb flashlights i phoned the company and they assured me i am not doing something wrong so i tried to return the stuff but they would not accept it because it was more than 8 days i hope nobody else will fall for this obvious scam i will keep the flashlights for my grand children to play with because the light is so poor it will not harm their eyes
1;41;126;0.7068729926291527;i do not have this flashlight light but just reading the specs it is selling beans in place of your milk cow xpe bulb the brightest bulb on thearket wrong that s an outdated emitter incapable of exceeding over 350 lumens this is not my opinion look up flashlight wikipedia under led emitters no self respecting manufacture uses and xpe emitter all are using xml2 at bare minimum or even xhp 70s which are capable of handling 5000 lumens and as far as a 5000mah 18650 battery another lie google for yourself and ask what the highest storage capacity 18650 is and it is only 3600 mah and as far as a zoomie lens another joke as zoomies lenses are very inefficient you loose up to 80 of the usable light when you narrow the beam to spot light please consumer and possible customers please look on budget light forums or candle power forums and do some research oh and those pictures and videos on there add are also false the video of the light setting a piece of paper on fire is not their light but a custom built light from adventure sport flashlight com i know the owner the pictire of a whole side of a house being lit up is not the shadowhawk it is from a noctigon meteor 243 video review this light is the real deal and pumps out over 6000 lumens everything iam saying is not opinion but fact
2;46;78;0.7053083673458924;the flashlight worked fine when i received it i put it in the glove compartment of my car and the first time i took it out to use it the battery was dead discolored and would not take a charge i ca n t find replacement battery s
3;59;107;0.6895093160260091;i bought directly from shadowhawk for 30 bucks it works fairly well and is bright but no brighter than the 5 buck knock off i bought on here nthe battery tested at 3000 mah so its about the same as the better 18650 batteries the charger is so slowwwww i do n t use it ni am not real big on the fact you have to buy a warranty either for 20 bucks you can get a copy of this light a couple of batteries and a better charger
4;77;24;0.6716187619599299;this flashlight is a very good deal it works very well as what s in the ad i like all the functions and the brightness of the light everything worked out of the box and still works i am very pleased
5;65;50;0.6499349498179138;update 4 19 17 this light has had very light use and today it just died n nphenomenal flashlight it does indeed light up an incredible amount from a far distance it came without any instructions you may ask why a flashlight may need instructions it came with a rechargeable battery and a charger when you plug the charger in it displays a green light when you insert the battery it displays a red light contrary to mist chargers i have a red light means the battery is not fully charged a green light indicates a full charge this appears to work in the exact opposite manner the flashlight also does not give any icon for which way the battery should be inserted into the sleeve of the flashlight the additional battery insert that allows the use of 3 aaa batteries does not show which way to insert batteries into it nor does it indicate which way the battery holder should be inserted into the sleeve of the flashlight instructions would help a user know how to address these issues and questions
6;78;67;0.6304236044887843;fwiw first i believe all the 1 star amazon reviews but my uncle bought what appears to be this same shadow hawk 800 via late night infomercial he bought 3 one did not work only bc litium battery was bad contacted company they said they are sending replacement nthe other two are awesome 800 lumen mega bright heavy metal tactical flashlights each come with optional 3 aaa battery pack 2nd battery option to use in lieu of the lithium battery even the flashlight with bad lithium battery worked with the alternate 3 aaa battery option neveryone who s seen it is like damn makes me wonder if this seller here is selling original product 5 stars thus far but will update if there is a failure obviously something is up since there are too many 1 star reviews do n t know what that s my 2 cents i got it as a gift so my perspective may be a little off but for me it s a sturdy heavy 800 lumen high grade bad ass flashlight not a 6 flashlight maybe this seller is swapping out the real shadowhawk substituting a piece of crap just a guess because something here does not make sense i d still be wary of 3am infomercial products even though my uncle received a very high quality product good luck
7;42;81;0.619434865177708;these are pos my ten dollar head band light is brighter and it s only 200 lumans plus batteries lasts longer than the 3aaa s used in this flashlight i got suckered injury buying five flashlights which was advertised as 15 dollars and get one free after i put my credit card info in it charged me 173 00 so i i called right away which no number was listed after you paid for it anywhere i m glad i still had the ad and used muy friends email account customer service is out of the country and you ca n t understand anything they re saying and they do n t understand you i finally got someone that spoke better english and the refined me seventy dollars but i was stuck with the rest and five crappy flashlights plus i got no lithium ion batteries or charger that was promised in ad njust adapters for 3 triple a s that last about 13 minutes on high which again is only about 100 lumins instead of the 800 to 1000 as promised n ndo not buy hugh rip off and misrepresentation of their product n nlet s get a civil lawsuit going top get our money back and let them keep their crappy flashlights
8;98;20;0.5465983640013921;for the money this is a really good quality flashlight very well made easy to use and the best thing is the light output highly recommended
9;19;41;0.49419174538826444;i bought this for my sister who has vision issues needs extra light when she s walking her dog after dark this flashlight is amazing it s so small easy to carry yet the beam is much much brighter wider than a regular flashlight i m buying another for myself
10;84;14;0.36931177904234536;i love it i actually ordered one for my uncle because he liked mine and he loves it too best flashlight ever
11;43;109;0.3346733708947396;light came in a box with no directions looks like it might have been used rechargeable battery only lasts for about 15 min and not near as bright as advertised not tactical at all
12;47;8;0.323730252636813;this flashlight lights ups the whole room we has one taken from us and replaced it immediately we love it it was especially usefulmduring the hurricane
13;10;4;0.30599100587522415;insanely awesome one of my neighbors said he heard all kinds of crackling in the woods behind both of our houses at around 2 in the morning so i stayed up the friday night and saturday night after i received the flashlight fully charged flashlight playing soccer on my phone finally heard all the crackling shore enough around 2 03 friday night but could see only eyeballs in the woods off in the distance but saturday night i waited til the crackling in the woods pretty much near the end of my yard close to my deck where are sitting comfortably looking out when i turn the light on i found one huge mother of a raccoon and three babies called animal control the next day they came out and laid safe traps collected the whole family i ve had plenty of flashlights for my jobs and for around my property but this thing is pretty ba made my backyard into daylight

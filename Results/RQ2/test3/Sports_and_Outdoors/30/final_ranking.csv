0;2;24;0.8520173629497905;i m recovering from back surgery and wanted a way to know rather than guess how close i come to meeting my daily walking goals this comparatively inexpensive pedometer does n t achieve perfection but it does get the job done non the up side it s small easy to read and includes a user controlled back light the belt clip is extremely secure and the screen displays everything from actual steps walked to total distance and calories burned it was easy to adjust the stride length and body weight my steps are tracked accurately with the sensitivity slider control set in the middle rather than all the way to the left as many other reviewers suggest i have learned that there is a bit of wiggle room on mine if i count off 20 steps it might say 19 on one set and 21 on the next in the long run i bothered to count all the way to 100 several times it was spot on non the down side the cover is extraordinarily difficult to open difficult as in i have wrestled with it for nearly five minutes just to pop it open i now do n t close it quite securely it does n t fall open and i can see some folks might be bothered by the imprecision over short term counting and for some reason if i clip it to a pants pocket rather than on a belt loop or my waist band it does n t seem to read anything at all i have no clue why this is so but it is a little disapointing nconsidering that every other pedometer i looked at was more than twice the price of this model i m astonished at how well it works perfectionists will likely prefer a more expensive version but for short term use casual interest easy going folks or even something to help get the kids more active you ca n t go wrong
1;13;16;0.7880419478085006;well i was all ready to give this product a decent review but ends up it is n t worth it it is hard to open but i can live with that some of the buttons are not that responsive as you ca n t flip back and forth from distance to steps to calories that easy it seems not to like that very much however it was doing the job i tested it out several times and it was only off by a couple of steps on each test on average though it was very accurate no phantom steps and no counting while i was sitting i would test 100 steps at a time and it came within 1 5 steps this made me happy as this is what i bought it for so why only 2 stars well as soon as it reached 1000 steps the readout went extremely dim i switched modes and it was fine but when i went back to steps it was dim again i reset it to 0 and it was ok again i ran a few tests and each time it went over 999 it dimmed out to a point where i could n t tell what the numbers were did i walk 2340 steps or 3246 steps now that is a big difference now put that big issue with the smaller ones and this product just does n t cut it too bad because it was accurate light and compact i m taking it back and trying another product with all the other bad reviews the chances of you picking a good one looks 50 50 this company has to really look at this product because selling something with a track record like this is not right
2;20;9;0.6481944367953988;i was really enjoying my oregon scientific pedometer i found it easy to use and accurate however after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor and that was it it no longer works i will probably buy another one but it needs to be treated with kid gloves
3;22;10;0.6462631137366267;i finally got around to spending the time to figure out how to program this item and then i dropped it on a cement surface it has n t worked since so i threw it out if you re careful this would probably be a great item
4;27;14;0.6121771377854126;i tried several relatively inexpensive pedometers 5 15 and was disappointed in their accuracy this oregon scientific pe316ca has been the best i have tried it has a sensitivity slide which the others did not have this feature allows you to set the sensitivity to the energy of your stride the others did n t record steps if i was sauntering easily only when i was power walking n ni have not had trouble with the snap opening the display as others have reported the digital display is large and easy to read the time is always displayed along with either steps or miles walked or calories expended set by entering your body weight the distance of your step can also be set whereas some of the other models use a default setting only n ni have only a few quibbles although the advertising indicates that you can use either a 12 or 24 hour clock the instructions indicate only 12 hour also the distance display is given only in miles you can not set kilometres if you prefer
5;7;7;0.5326560399558732;pros it s really cheap and has a lot of features set stride length calories clock backlight protective door n ncon the door is really incredibly intolerably hard to open i was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open i tried to trim the plastic tab but i took too much off now the door flops open it was useless the way it came from the factory now i broke it and ca n t use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed n nalso i was never able to get a very accurate step count i would count 100 steps and usually get 65 90 steps on the readout though i m not really sure because i had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open n nfor the price i think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it

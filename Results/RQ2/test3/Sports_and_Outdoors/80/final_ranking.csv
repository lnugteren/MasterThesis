0;48;20;0.8799344651070874;i just set it up last night the instructions were mostly clear i ve set things up before so i believe i m pretty experienced in that department it was n t like ikea instructions so that s good it was in english without a million pages of other languages it took about an hour and a half from opening the big 60 lb box to completion there were a lot of small parts and things to unpackage so that took the most time there are 6 steps to it but those steps are pretty simple to get through each part of them once it all was together i used it and it kicked my butt the timer is nice to have on it the only con i have about the entire thing and it could just be my shoes my feet slide forward on the pedals maybe i m supposed to have my toes jammed all the way up to the front but that s not very comfortable i think it would be good if i put down some sort of silicone or rubber material on the foot pedals so i do n t slide around n nas per another reviewer on here i did use loctite with all the bolts i used medium loctite incase i wanted to return it can you imagine disassembling it to put everything back in the box just the way it came to send back no thank you but i do n t want to return it so that s a relief i ll post back in a few months and let you know progress and what s working on it and if i still love it thanks
1;5;69;0.8371679581136254;i bought this because i m a college student and a single mom so getting to the gym is a joke when you have a 6 month old i love it i get the same results as i do from the one i used at the gym it has an incline but it makes it so i do get the same results i used loctite like one of the other reviews suggest and it works awesome nothing has come apart my only problem is i do n t have the stamina i did before i was pregnant so this thing kicks my butt on a regular basis if you do n t want to spend a lot and need to stay at home more i would definitely get this one i live 15 minutes from the closest gym and it s cheaper to have this than go to the gym and pay for an hour of daycare every day plus gas i m also 230lbs and it holds up well with my weight so it s very study i used loctite on anything that needed to stay in place and i have had no problems at all
2;60;41;0.8216740644035867;it s great for what it is a cheap machine i had a high quality elliptical years ago where i just breezed through work outs this one requires a lot more physical strength to get it going than the more expensive ones but i suppose that ads to the workout it s loud i ca n t watch a show on my laptop while on it but i can watch a show on the tv where i can turn the volume up another con is that the screen where you monitor your distance time etc is pretty low and if you ve got poor vision it s difficult to see n nset up was super easy and took me a small framed female just about 45 minutes to assemble the directions are not great if you are not a visual learner there are few words explanations but lots of pictures n noverall it s a fine machine it s pretty small and compact i do n t hate it now i just have to use it more frequently
3;33;13;0.8123194412420102;this thing is kicking my butt and i love it i can only manage about five minutes at a time before the muscles in my legs need a break but in the two months that i ve owned it i ve lost fourteen pounds and 3 body fat i ve still got a long way to go but it feels so good to actually be working towards becoming a stronger person i love how it s zero impact as well as a fat girl 211lbs as of today medium to high impact exercises usually make my chest hurt thanks to my large breasts bouncing around even with so called high impact sports bras but i can even go sans bra if i want when using this and there s no pain whatsoever in my chest or back n neven at my weight the elliptical stays stable no rocking around or anything even without a mat i love the wheels too which make it easy to tip and move out of the way when not in use n ni did n t quite realize how much this had started to build up my strength until i had to run down the block the other day normally i do n t run if i absolutely have to i d be winded with aching shins after just a few yards but this time i d made it down the block and to my destination before i had even realized i was n t hurting or gasping for air okay so maybe that s not a big deal for normal healthy people but as a fat girl who s always been a little resigned about knowing she d be one of the first to get eaten during the zombie apocalypse it was a huge deal for me and it made me really proud of myself knowing i was on the right track towards becoming a stronger person n nobviously this machine is not whisper quiet or anything since i ve seen a few people asking but it s not that noisy either you can still listen to music or watch a show while you re working out but you will have to turn it up a few clicks above your normal volume or use headphones
4;79;68;0.8034341193565291;i ve had this machine for about 2 weeks now it took my fiance about 1 hour to put the whole thing together he said the instructions were not the best but he was able to figure it out n ni am not one who typically goes to the gym so i have limited experience with nice quality ellipticals however this one is getting the job done stability is pretty decent i m not that worried about it tipping over or anything i ve used it about 10 times in the past two weeks and it has performed well the little computer is really hard to read so i just use my phone to keep track of my time but it is nice to see at the end of my workout how many calories i ve burned and how far i ve gone just do n t plan on relying on the computer while you work out unless you have super human sight n nonly other thing i wish it had would be straps on the pedals to better anchor your feet to the pedals other than that i am pretty pleased with this purchase quite cheap for the workout i am getting n nwill update it if there are any problems after more use
5;28;19;0.8032214800445115;ok guys these is not only inexpensive but it hardly takes up any room at all i was looking for a cheap eliptical that was n t going to fall apart after a few uses well i m glad i ordered this i ve had it for a couple months and it still works great it s not wobbly at all i weigh about 130lbs and it has adjustable tension which is great it certainly is n t top of the line but it s worth the price i think if your over 200lbs it might be a bit wobbly though i love the fact that it has a digital display that shows the distance speed time and calories it took me about an hour to put together and i did it by myself
6;13;33;0.802377160384252;1 so many parts to assemble i wanted to cry when i pulled it all out of the box see pic but once it is out of the box there is no turning back if you ve never assembled a piece of furniture this might be too dificult for a first time project but if you understand how to follow part a and bolt 3 directions then it is possible to put together alone it took me a couple hours with a couple stress breaks n2 the reviews that say it slopes forward are correct my toes felt like they were getting crammed into the toes of my shoes as i used it painful so i quickly stopped using it i ended up getting a 4x4 piece of wood and propping up the front rail to make it feel level disappointing to have to make my own modification n3 feels solid for the price i was worried it would feel cheap like a bucket of bolts or all plastic it is neither it feels very solid and like a steal for such a good price
7;55;15;0.7939621106008216;i ve been using this every day since it arrived which was 19 days ago and i really enjoy it installation was fine all very clear instructions and easy to do the screw on the right foot came loose a couple times during use so i just keep my allen wrenches nearby in case i need to tighten them up since the last tightening a week ago they have been stable it could be that i simply did n t tighten them enough the first time n nit was really quiet at first but now it has started making an annoying clicking sound i think something inside is rubbing up against the plastic casing where the belt is i may open it up and see if i can fix it it s not too bad though and this unit is over all really convenient and low maintenance on a personal note i ve lost 12 pounds since getting it i use it every day for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour i ve also changed my diet for the price this machine is great hence the 5 stars if were more expensive i d probably give it 4 because of the little things ni have actually recommended it to real live friends
8;29;14;0.7889020219142895;i read so many reviews of the product before buying it and to tell the truth i was a little bit doubt if i was going to buy it or not nbut good thing i did buy it nit takes some time to put it all together though around 30 minutes nif you are looking for something to help you do some exercise at home because you do n t have time or money to go to the gym this is great and fits anywhere ni ve been working out with this for almost two months everyday for around 40 to 50 minutes and it s not a great great one like at the gym but it does the good job it is supposed to nmy weight is 190 and it did n t break till now lol nit makes a little bit of noisy but just put some oil once in a while
9;11;18;0.7672295243676416;takes a half hour to put it together if you want a incline you can adjust it on the bottom it is easy to nassemble if you can read nall parts are there and some are hidden in the sterofoam so look closely to find them some parts have na left and right it is incredible and i recommend it if you want to work out i was tired of sitting on my nexercise bike so i upgraded it is around 60 pounds and mine is black it is heavy duty and made well it ncome with batteries too i use my pedals just like riding a bike never go backwards or you will ruin it nafter a few months you need to oil the nuts and bolts it has a easy dial tension it has a lcd display that nindicates distance calories burned elapsed time and speed i just love it if you put it together the right way nit will last a very long time it has large pedals with ridges to prevent foot slippage but i slip sometimes it has ntransportation wheels for easy relocation but i keep mine in the family room near my tv the weight limit is n260 pounds nit has dual action workout arms provide an upper body workout it is made in china and it is 33 by 19 by 46 inches nthe natural elliptical motion eliminates any stress on joints and that is why i bought it love it it has a easy dial ntension adjustment for adjustable challenges i started out on easy and worked my way up it is lots of fun
10;40;5;0.6762360015333316;i agree with another reviewer that you get what you pay for i bought this for my wife for her birthday i just wanted to get something not too expensive she could use during the fall winter months in between visits to the fitness center assembly was n t too difficult she used it for about 10 weeks when it locked up and you could not move the pedals and arms at all i could not figure out how to get it out of its locked state so i contacted support through the form on their website i got an instant auto response back the service level expectation is 48 hours for a response time 5 days went by and no answer i look up the product manual and see there is a call center number although email is the preferred method of communication no one answers i go to voice messaging and leave a voicemail explaining my previous contact with no answer i provided my email address so that they could look up and respond to my inquiry still nothing yet cheap product and horrible service nothing more to be said

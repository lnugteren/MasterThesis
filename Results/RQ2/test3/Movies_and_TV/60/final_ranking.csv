0;21;19;0.8513452629646773;it s too bad amazon has lumped all of the quiet man reviews onto each version nof this movie they are not all the same that s for certain n nthe blu ray edition that i am rating is the very best that i have seen so far and i ve nhad both dvd versions before the 60th anniversary and now the blu ray n ni only gave the blu ray four stars as this is not the best restoration that i have nseen released on blu ray disc there are several frames where damage or ncolor fringing has not been removed or restored you ll notice the color fringing non very high contrast frames especially in the beginning of the movie where sean thornton nand mary kate first see each other as she is herding sheep nit s red fringing or chromatic aberration there is a bit of green fringing from ntime to time but it s hardly noticeable n nthere is also a large bright spot to the very right edge middle of the frame when nmr flinn and sean thornton are walking across the glen to thornton s newly npurchased cottage it stays in the image for a long time and i ca n t believe they nmissed correcting it it occurs again during a later frame i believe with mary kate nbut i ca n t remember the specific frame n nreds are severely over saturated in this movie and i made corrections accordingly non my tv i know it s not my television as i have calibrated it and other blu ray nmovies have near perfect image quality on it n nif you are a stickler for image quality as i am and you have a nice quality tv nthen i encourage you to make adjustments for this movie and write them down ni have a samsung 42 and here are the adjustments that i made n ntry going into your tvs menu and find the equivalent of picture mode ni chose dynamic and then these settings nbacklight 10 and that is low on the scale ncontrast 70 nbrightness 35 nsharpness 45 ncolor 45 ntint g53 r47 n npicture options ncolor tone cool ndigital noise filter high nmpeg noise filter high n nthese may or may not help depending on your ntv but at least you might get an idea of what tweaking nyou can do i wrote mine down and put a copy in the nmovie case so i can quickly tweak the settings and enjoy nthe movie that much faster n ni chose dynamic as this movie was filmed in technacolor and the ncolors really popped in the original i tried other viewing versions nin my tv menu but they just did n t have the color match for the nfilm some people will say that is the reason for the fringing etc nbut i tried in the less dynamic modes and you not only get the same nissues but less color quality you be the judge of your own viewing nexperience n nthe blu ray version really is a much better version that anything out there nbut i had high hopes for this edition and i got the feeling nas many have in the past that the wayne family does n t want to nput much effort money into the wayne movies being restored n nthat just get by attitude really shows in the quality of the nrestorations i do photography work i have only read up on nhow much time and effort it takes to restore video but really nif you are going to do it why not just do it right n nthis is an incredible movie and for some of us it is also of historical nvalue this ireland is gone for ever except where it s captured in video ni hope this review helps others to make an informed decision before buying nyou wo n t regret this blu ray version i know they released a regular dvd n60th version but i have not seen it n ngood luck and i hope you enjoy the quiet man on blu ray as most of us have nnever before seen it n nmy movie was purchased from amazon but i received it as a gift
1;14;9;0.8350479075895085;i am not sure why amazon saw fit to lump all the dvd reviews in with the blu ray version but that s neither here nor there for the purposes of this review what is to the point at least from my perspective is this blu ray version is the anti dvd the claim is this blu ray of the quiet man comes from a 4k scan of an original print i can say this is very much the truth and what it means for you is it will feel like you are there when you watch it n nthe quality is both the best and worst that technology has to offer when i read the claim of a 4k scan my first thought was but one word overkill it was n t until roughly 1970 that movie film had enough grain that more or less it matched what later became the hd standard we all know today that being said the 4k scan put absolutely the maximum amount of resolution that will ever be possible to obtain from an original print of the quiet man the only way to get better from this point is to process the 4k scan via software and somehow auto magically remove the grain n nsadly this means the images on your hd television will both be the highest resolution of the quiet man you have ever seen and grainy at the same time in other words do n t expect to sit close to your hd tv expecting to ferret out minute details you never noticed before you will see the grain of the original film coming through at all times n nassuming you are not sitting within eighteen inches of your hd tv what you will see is the most beautiful vibrant and beautiful movie that is possible at this point there are details that were never possible to see with the slipshod transfers that have been made up to now with vhs and dvds i have a vhs of a taping from tv and one of the dvds so i know of whence i speak when i say n nif you are a fan of the quiet man and you have yet to purchase the blu ray version you are missing out n nis n t that the best possible reason to purchase this blu ray version i am so glad i purchased it because it was like watching a the quiet man for the very first time all over again i really ca n t think of a higher complement than that n nthe bottom line is if you do n t add the quiet man blu ray to your collection more is the pity for you
2;46;16;0.8348167812183339;i am writing specifically about the quality of the blu ray and not the movie itself in short it is wonderful the video transfer is very nice with bright vivid colors there are a few places where there are some imperfections obviously in the original source but overall this transfer is top notch i have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last four decades and watching this blu ray was like watching it for the first time the old vhs and dvd versions were so dark in places it was hard to make out exactly what was going on and even scenes that were supposed to be bright and sunny looked like they were filmed on an overcast day not so here for example there is a scene near the end of the movie where sean and will are coming home for supper there is a shot where the camera pans up to the cottage in the old versions it was so dark that all you could see was the exterior of the cottage in this blu ray you can actually see mary kate standing in the doorway the sound quality is good as well but only available in mono due to the source material i highly recommend this version to any fan of the quiet man even if you own previous versions you wo n t be unhappy with the purchase
3;11;7;0.8176441199713793;the olivefilms bluray version of the quiet man is the only way to watch this movie n ni have owned several versions of the dvd of this movie hoping each new release would be the definitive cleaned version but they are all the same terrible the color in these old dvds is so horribly washed out and blurred that i really felt as if i would never see the true version of the film it was like looking at michelangelo s sistine chapel ceiling covered in 400 years of candle smoke and prior botched restorations these earlier dvds were scans of bad transfers probably from the vhs days replicated over and over degrading with each new transfer if it says artisan on the back cover you know what i mean there was no love for the movie until this release and what a difference wow n nfrom the opening scene to the final credits it s as if this is a completely different movie and what a new movie this is terrific i have to give cudos to olivefilms for taking the time and putting in the effort to get this right it looks great
4;42;12;0.7510962713214034;all i will add to the other comments is that if you are considering getting this disc do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple of bucks to get the blu ray the picture quality is phenomenal i ve seen the quiet man multiple times on tv and 2nd rate dvd transfers i had no idea the movie looked this good until i saw the blu ray version
5;20;2;0.7280215537362129;bottom line a daring change of pace role for the duke that sees him ranging far outside his normal fields of duty on the battlefield or in the saddle but which nonetheless remains a uniquely john wayne film certainly a beautiful looking movie filmed almost entirely on location in the lush green rolling hills of ireland give it a chance and i think you ll enjoy it 4 stars n nthe story john wayne portrays a retired prize fighter who turns his back on the sport after unintentionally killing an opponent while in the ring he abandons his comfortable life in the us returning to his native birthplace of ireland where he hopes to disappear and live out his remaining days in peace and anonymity shortly upon arriving however he makes some enemies among the local well to do and also falls head over heels for a feisty fiery red headed gal it all comes to a head in the final act and the duke must battle not only a stubborn local bigwig but ultimately his own inner demons if he hopes to find a lasting inner outer peace n nthoughts i d never seen the quiet man until i purchased this new blu ray it s a terrific little film one that many aficionados of the duke have likely never heard of his tough guy roles movies are far more well known but like the wonderful and equally atypical film hatari his reflective work here in the quiet man is surprisingly good deserving of at least one viewing from everyone who considers themselves a true john wayne fan the movie is a personal favorite of both wayne and his long time friend and collaborator director john ford the film looks gorgeous with several sweeping vistas of the rugged verdant beauty of the famed emerald isle on full display top notch supporting cast acting aids the feel of the film with especially solid turns by stunningly sexy maureen o hara and frequent wayne co star ward bond as the rascally local priest those who consider john wayne as nothing more than a swaggering one note lunk with little to recommend outside his westerns wwii flicks need to pipe down and watch this movie some call it wayne s best film and i can not argue much against their thinking it s a damn shame that this did n t get as much airplay over the years as his other more popular work n nthe blu ray you re not likely to see the quiet man look or sound better since the day it hit cinemas than it does here on this outstanding new hi def release from olive films all previous versions pale in comparison the visual clarity is simply stunning like the recent hi def release of alfred hitchcock s the trouble with harry the countrysides and location scenery on this blu ray edition of the quiet man are truly breath taking to behold like watching a moving picture postcard wow sound is also clear clean and crisp no hissing pops or crackles to annoy the ear bonus content is minimal but respectable most notably a 30 minute retrospective making of piece hosted by noted film historian leonard maltin the film s theatrical trailer is also included i m sure glad i bought a copy it s one of wayne s most daring departures from his usual fare and i think it s in the top five of his all time best
6;38;6;0.6846084551521594;i have seen this film on dvd and this new blu ray version that has been restored is the only way to see it they did a fantastic job of restoring this film it is a 5 star rating however i gave this a 1 star rating because the only special feature on it is a documentary hosted by a very young looking leonard maltin from a much older dvd 2002 and it looks awful by comparison miss o hara s commentary is missing as well as two or three other features from a previous dvd version which is a crime by my standards this film is a classic by many people in the industry as well as the public and for some reason they did not include these other features this is not a rare thing as other dvd s i have are changed when the blu ray version comes out so i have to keep the dvd if i ever want to see those again many people do n t ever watch the extras on dvd s etc but i do and its a shame since there is so much to talk about
7;8;3;0.6068760667505808;this blu ray edition from olive films is amazing i hate that amazon has reviews for the old dvd edition on the blu ray page just grab it the price is low the film is one of the great films and the blu ray is truly worthwhile grab the dreaming the quiet man documentary blu ray also from olive if you re sore about the lack of features both discs are cheap and great take a look at other olive blu ray releases they ve quickly become one of my favorite labels maybe even more reliable transfers than criterion these days
8;13;5;0.5532132140033966;this is a great movie to watch if you want to get your irish on indeed if you are irish and do not have this movie then all i can say is shame on you the blue ray is a very nice improvement over dvd this is a manly movie and as far away from pc as one can get without being completely offensive to females the duke has made better movies but few where he is this likable o hare is absolutely stunning in this movie i think for most people who have never seen this movie by the end you will say wow how have i missed this one

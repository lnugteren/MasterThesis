0;18;16;0.8041515716572698;the rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the tv show the people who developed the film were huge avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie when warner s realized that they did n t have a big budget summer film for 1998 they rushed production on the avengers threw a lot of money at it and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit needless to say pandering to the masses and doing good avengers are incompatible which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused though i am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than i ended up unfortunately take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense apparently the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money which is exactly how much they made nregarding the film itself it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch the three leads are badly miscast you ca n t replace macnee and rigg though patrick stewart and lucy lawless would have been much more interesting than fiennes and thurman and sean connery chews scenery like he had n t eaten in months would love the dvd to have loads of extras i am sure are milling about somewhere including commentary by the director on what happened nstick with the tv show
1;4;12;0.7765607805709194;i loved the original avengers series it was a near flawless program at least until diana rigg left this film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show the original avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful almost comic book quality characters however in this film the plot meanders ralph fiennes has no comic ability and the lovely and talented uma thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie these is no trace of the quirky style that made the avengers so special to those of us who have seen the tv series it comes as little surprise that several of the original program s directors went on to success in the big screen i doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities the chemistry between diana rigg and patrick macnee was always a delight to watch sadly in the film fienes looks uncomfortable and thurman looks bored nthis is a poorly conceived uninspired waste of film the television avengers unique character is nowhere to be found in this disaster
2;14;8;0.6619539054939209;let s face it this movie is terrible whether or not you compare it to the brilliant sixties series i went in with an open mind knowing that patrick macnee and diana rigg will always be john steed and emma peel i thought the addition of sean connery as the villain would be a delight wrong the tv shows wonderful theme by laurie johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness uma thurman acted like she was on prozac and ralph fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was john steed and sean what a lousy performance you know you could have done better i did like the mechanical bees sequence the only true original touch in the movie the teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked but since the whole movie was such a drag i m not sure anything could save it macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role too bad uma did n t back out and get replaced by a more lively mrs peel
3;6;11;0.6309402701595721;this movie is easily on my top 5 list of the worst films i have ever seen the painful truth of the matter is that i saw this in the theater what a horrible memory that is i am a 33 year old male and in my entire life i have never wanted to leave the movie house as badly as i wanted to while watching this pile of rubbish i have never walked out on any movie much to my dismay i should have left during this one in fact i remember at least 4 people leaving the theater never to return one scene in particular haunts me to this very day there is a complex conspiracy afoot and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold they decide to wear disguises to conceal their identities they are all dressed in giant multi colored teddy bear costumes what yes you read it correctly it is so incredibly stupid that i have a hard time retelling it without my lower intestine reaching up and strangling my brain note that last obscure referrence is from the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy anyway this film does not deserve a long review so i will now sign off rent or buy anything else anything other than this movie i hope my warning here will save lives or at least save people from emotional scarring take care

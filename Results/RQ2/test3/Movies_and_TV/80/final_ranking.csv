0;43;57;0.9194068261049573;as soon as i heard that christopher reeve died the first thing that came to my mind was my favorite scene in superman this is when clark kent has spied lois lane dangling from a helicopter atop the daily planet building discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of metropolis and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big s that stands for truth justice and the american way the second thing i thought about was the director whose name i forget who was chastised by a friend for considering reeve for a serious film since the actor had played superman the director s rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an american icon like superman if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film superman returns and that apparently they have settled on actor james caviezel who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people of course the final thing i thought about with regard to reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995 n nthe tagline for the 1978 film superman was that you ll believe a man can fly but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the man of steel reeve did not even get top billing in fact he was billed third behind marlon brando as jor el and gene hackman as lex luthor yet the whole movie hinged on reeve not only as the heroic superman but as the purposefully bumbling clakr kent of course it was a put on and with reeve it was clear as it would become in the dc comics about superman after this movie came out that superman was the real person and clark kent the faux identity i also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on off variable clark and superman part their hair on opposite sides n nrichard donner filmed superman and a lot of superman ii at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie think the three mustketeers and the four musketeers but there is decidedly a sense in which superman is three different films the first taking place on krypton is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led jor el to put the infant kal el into a spacecraft and send him to earth to survive the death of krytpon the second set in smallville kansas is pure americana as young clark kent jeff east has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on earth to do something more important than score touchdowns a lesson imparted by pa kent glenn ford in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious oscar nomination n nhowever most of the film takes place in metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts clark kent is a klutz perry white jackie cooper a blowhard and lois lane margot kidder can not spell hackman s lex luthor has fun going over the top playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team miss teschmacher valerie perrine and otis ned beatty no wonder reeve s superman comes out of this one looking so good he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else the sequence in the film is when superman follows up his rescue of lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving air force one to rescuing a cat up a tree certainly this superman has more of a sense of humor than his predecessors although clearly in an all american sort of way the ending is big in a comic book sort of way but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when superman weeps over the body of lois n nwatch superman and superman ii again some time to remember how good reeve was in the role but to honor his memory skip the third and fourth superman movies if you want more of reeve then go check out someone in time another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can think yourself back in time deathtrap and the remains of the day if you want more of the superman mythos the first two seasons of smallville are out on dvd which connects nicely to the second act of this film while if you catch repeats of lois and clark the new adventures of superman you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people
1;51;50;0.9003200825847713;although the majority of fans seem to prefer the sequel this origin movie is still a very entertaining cinematic excursion that had movie audiences lining around the block in 1978 only one year after the star wars phenomenon had redefined the term blockbuster and transformed the movie landscape in fact it holds up so well even today that the upcoming superman returns is supposably a part of this franchise occurring six years after the events of superman ii and even features marlon brando in the theatrical trailer as the voice of jor el nwith a 55 million budget which was enormous for its time this movie eventually raked in almost 300 million world wide which even today stands as a quite respectable take in addition it featured a knock out punch by john williams who went from scoring jaws to scoring star wars and then onto superman amazing nremastered for its 2001 dvd release this movie is a vast improvement on a master print that had deteriorated to such an extent that some sequences were close to unwatchable this print is clearer and sharper and corrects some previous color balancing problems it also has a remastered soundtrack that means it sounds the best it has ever since its original 1978 release nas an added bonus it also features about eight minutes of additional footage that effectively doubles marlon brando s screen time with new scenes on krypton and at the fortress of solitude in addition there s more early clark kent and disaster footage finally rounding out the new scenes is the reinstated lex luthor gauntlet of death sequence which had previously been seen on network television broadcasts in stark contrast to the ire that added scenes to the star wars movies has drawn from fans fans of this series seemed largely welcome to the additions here nwhere this dvd really shines however is in the special features which are impressive first up is a scene specific commentary by director richard donner and scribe tom mankiewicz after writing the first three james bond movies of the 1970s mankiewicz was brought onto superman to help with the script however due to certain legal complications he could nopt be credited for the work he did and so was handed the title of creative consultant this is the kind of commentary that i love it s screen specific and its light and friendly it s like having donner and mankiewicz hanging out in your living room watching this beloved movie of your childhood with you they share a number of memories on making the movie and its good to see mankiewicz get his proper recognition nthere s also an isolated score audio track that allows the viewer to marvel at the work of williams nbut there s more the jewel in the crown special feature is the three documentaries that actually act more as three chapters in one larger feature length documentary before the indiana jones trilogy came out with its three hour behind the scenes feature and before the three hour empire of dreams documentary for the star wars trilogy dvd release we have the behind the scenes documentaries here that presented the benchmark by which all future dvd releases were judged nhosted by marc mcclure jimmy olsen they feature on camera interviews with donner the late christopher reeve margot kidder gene hackman and mankiewicz among others they cover such issues as the making of the film the failed attempts at making a man fly and the unceremonious firing of donner who had delivered the producers a smash hit and was already over halfway through the shooting of the sequel still donner had the last laugh when several years later he got to direct all four movies of the phenomenally successful lethal weapon movies nmore a curiosity as anything else is a separate feature on the superman lois lane ursa screen tests that include five different actresses vying for the part of lois lane nthe younger audiences that have grown up watching smallville on the wb will no doubt be a little confused by this movie that follows a more conventional storyline than the popular tom welling series i m probably in the minority when it comes to preferring the incredible erica durance as lois lane but margot kidder does an admirable job here and gene hackman is an interesting choice as lex luthor nhowever where there is no debate is christopher reeve largely unknown at the time of casting this movie reeve embodies the part of clark kent and was elevated to even more mythic proportions by the courage with which he tackled his unfortunate accident nstarting with the death of krypton and ending with superman saving california this movie and its sequel set a good foundation for superman returns and this dvd should find a place of honor on the shelf of every self respecting dvd collector
2;53;39;0.8938737445938448;if you already own the 2001 dvd expanded version of superman the movie then hang onto it and save your money the upgrade to this four disc collection simply is n t worth it in my opinion unless you re a die hard superman fan n nthis is what the four disc collection includes on disc 1 is the theaterical version the movie with a feature length commentary by the producers ilya salkind and pierre spemgler disc 2 has the expanded version though techincally correct i do n t really consider an extra eight mintues to the film to be an expanded version with a feature length commentary by richard donner and tom mankievicz this is also on the 2001 dvd on disc 3 are the three documentaries that can also be found on the 2001 dvd each one running about thirty minutes in length taking flight the development of superman making superman filming the legend and the magic behind the cape there s also a look at some deleted and restored scenes finally on disc 4 is a fifty minute 1980 tv documentary on the making of superman the movie a lot of this is already included in the three documentaries on disc 3 there s also the fifty minute 1951 movie superman and the mole men starring george reeves and phyllis coats plus nine superman cartoons from the 1940 s n ni had n t seen superman the movie since it originally came out in 1978 and i was surprised at how well it held up i watched the expanded edition instead of the theatrical version i have to admit however that i enjoyed the first half of the film more than i did the second the first half was much more serious in tone while the second half was striving to be campy and joke filled there were also a couple of plots holes in the second half of the movie that the viewer just has to overlook an example is that if superman can fly fast enough to turn the earth s orbit backwards in time why could n t he get to lois lane s sinking car fast enough to save her anyway because it had been so long since i d seen the movie i did n t really notice anything different with the expanded edition nothing stood out for me which is why i do n t think eight minutes amounts to much though it is better than the minute and a half that donner added to lethal weapon 3 for the director s cut n ni did enjoy the documentaries on disc 3 it was fun seeing just how skinny christopher reeve was when he auditioned for the role also i did n t know that richard donner had been fired from superman ii though he already had 50 to 70 of the movie in the can he was actually doing part i and ii at the same time it was interesting to hear how warner brothers did n t want anything to do with the movie at first but then began to cought up money once they finally realized just how good the film was going to be and before richard donner was brought in to direct the film the producers had hired guy hamilton to do it hamilton was the director of goldfinger it was only because the shooting location of the film was eventually changed from italy to england that hamilton was dropped he had n t paid his taxes in england and donner was brought on board hamilton had already been involved in a year of pre production with the film but donner could n t use any of it and had to start over from scratch donner was under a tremendous amount of pressure by everyone for example the producers had richard lester ready to step in at any moment as the director yet he managed to get the movie made it turned out to be one warner brother s biggest hits donner s reward was to be fired from superman ii hollywood n ndisc 4 did n t do that much for me as i said parts of the 1980 documentary had been included in the three 2001 documentaries on disc 3 i did watch the short movie superman and the mole men which was pretty funny the mole men were played by little people with rubber bald caps on and a black jump suits i found myself laughing out loud when lois lane first sees them and freezes in absolute fear the expression on her face is priceless then a mother in the near by town sees them and screams so loud that people several blocks away can hear her as if she s standing right next to them man that was one loud scream i will say that george reeves was a much better actor than people gave him credit for i felt he was smart to play clark kent as a straight hard hitting reporter rather than as a bumbling navie innocent the way christopher reeve did as far as the cartoons go i did n t watch any of them was n t interested n nif i had it to do over again i d pick up the 2001 dvd edition of the expanded film and save fifteen dollars last but not least for any of you interested in superman ii there are now two versions of it out so be careful in buying one is the richard lester version which i got by mistake and the other is the complete richard donner edition i barely made it through the richard lester version though sarah douglas is sexy in it as ursa the film just does n t hold up for me and seems too silly
3;35;45;0.8849430801436651;i was born in 1976 so i spent most of my developmental years in the wonderful 80 s although i was still a bit young when superman the movie hit the big screen i caught up with him through vhs and television plenty have donned the red cape from george reeves to dean cain and everyone in between brandon routh who i have yet to see in the latest film is the current hero of the day christopher reeve was is and always will be superman to me i do n t care how hokey the special effects look in this particular flick or how bad the third and fourth films were reeve is the man of steel in my opinion n nthis film gives us the origination story of kal el son of jor el of the planet known as krypton if you ve been around for a few years you probably know the rest of the story so i ll skip that and just stick with the performances of the actors and actresses i ve gloated on reeve enough but i have to admit that his bungling country tinged clark kent is perfect he does a complete 180 degree turn when he rips open his business suit and that s bursts onto the scene lois lane is done with sassy flair by the great margot kidder she much like reeve has become her character in my mind gene hackman hams it up as superman s arch enemy lex luthor his over the top performance is fun to watch on the screen ned beatty portrays the bumbling sidekick otis and valerie perrine is a scene stealer as the luscious eve marlon brando is sufficient as kent s father but his performance comes across as rather wooden terence stamp general zod jack o halloran non and maria schell vond ah have sinister small roles in this feature but set the stage well for superman ii the rest of the cast primarily reduced to supporting roles do a wonderful job with what they have to work with n nas stated before the special effects are pretty hokey by today s standards but they were top notch in 1978 they help move the story along at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen n nthis film set a high standard for future comic book based films while many have met and in some cases surpassed this standard superman will always be considered the first of the great modern comic flicks n nhighly recommended to any fan of comic flicks or anyone who just wants to relive the excitement of seeing ol superman fly for the first time
4;50;48;0.8799399730188565;in my anxiety to see superman returns i ve been passing time by watching again every superman movie and television series live action and animated that i can get my hands on i went through the george reeves series the lois clark and superboy smallsville series and the cartoon superman justice league and god help me even the 70 s superfriends shows but i ve saved for last the piece de resistance the christopher reeve classics n ni ve genuinely forgotten how great and sweet the 1978 superman film was and is a feeling of enchantment is launched in the air as june 1938 flashes on the screen then a boy leafs thru the pages of action comics the young lad s voiceover commenting on the depression and the importance of truth dealing newspapers such as the daily planet in so turbulent and troubled an era then the immortal john williams crafted superman theme song is heard and the adventure begins true i ve always had to grind my teeth and wait out the sterile 25 minute opening but once the film focuses on planet earth and the arrival of baby kal el it s all so good the segment of clark s child and teenhood is depicted in an almost pastoral manner giving heft to scenes of clark learning how truly special he is and how he is ultimately alone these bittersweet moments of lessons learned will shape the man that clark will become then the tragedy of his adopted father s death leading eventually to clark s discovery of the fortress of solitude and thus his kryptonian heritage there is almost a sense of intermission at this point wherein the viewer can take a breath relax and prepare for the second half of the film i think i ll start a new paragraph n ntwelve years pass clark now in his superman guise flies away from the fortress of solitude the camera cuts next to a cabbie telling his passenger that he s arrived at the daily planet and clark kent s new chapter begins there he meets lois lane jimmy olsen and editor in chief perry white clark does n t waste time setting up his bespectacled persona of cluelessness and clumsiness in several nicely paced sequences that had moments of sheer hilarity and screwballness next superman s nemesis shows up the fiendishly clever and criminal lex luthor and things begin to get somewhat serious though luthor s wacky sidekicks intermittently interject an element of humor luthor s plan is diabolical and ably challenges superman s abilities but in the end all is well as the man of steel foils luthor s scheme and sends him packing to the hoosegow superman has a fleeting romantic moment with lois end of film n nchristopher reeve christopher reeve christopher reeve despite the all star cast christopher reeve makes the movie he inhabits superman as if he were his favorite pajamas instilling in his iconic superhero that perfect blend of confidence steely resolve and gentlemanly decorum on the other hand he infuses his clark kent with the proper amount of aw shucks country bumpkin and slouching mild mannerisms a perfect portrayal christopher reeve was born to be superman the reaction of the crowd upon supe s first public appearance is still thrilling to witness lois lane s freaked out you ve got me but who s got you is still a classic line margot kidder is delicious as reporter lois lane nosy plucky and in your face she melts perfectly for superman and routinely snubs clark kent go check out the screen test in the special features to see how much better margot is compared to the other actresses that went for the role gene hackman plays luthor more comically than i would ve expected but what the hell it works the best i can say of marlon brando as jor el is that his distinctive voice is used in the trailer of superman returns n nthe special effects for their time are wonderfully innovative and wow inducing the only effect that does n t look convincing is the sequence where teenage clark outruns a train everything else perfection n nthe special features are pretty sweet side a contains an insightful commentary by director richard donner 10 added scenes including a young lois with her parents on a train and a scene with jor el and superman some superman the legacy fun facts and a theatrical trailer n nside b contains three documentaries taking flight the development of superman making superman filming the legend and the magic behind the cape deleted scenes screen tests of superman reeve with sweaty pits lois lane with actresses anne archer lesley ann warren margot kidder and stockard channing and ursa the kryptonian supervillainess in the sequel a teaser trailer and a tv spot n nthis is a classic film full of matinee fun and movie magic it certainly has stood the test of time despite the fact that i ca n t wait to see superman returns i doubt it could live up to superman 1 or 2 speaking of which i think i ll pop in the sequel now
5;14;4;0.8607455300813402;hat s off to warner archive for releasing this legendary extended version of superman the movie this version was a true event when it was shown over two nights on abc in 1983 this was long before the internet or hundreds of cable channels and most people watched what was on the three main networks live not only was abc showing a hugely popular movie they were showing it with 40 minutes of never before seen footage this was a mind blowing concept at the time it was before the era of deleted scenes on dvd and was the first time people were introduced to the concept that scenes were actually cut out of movies n nlow quality vhs copies of that abc version and subsequent 1980s broadcasts have circulated for years among collectors when wb video released stm in various forms over the years fans always requested the tv version instead we got the 2000 special edition which restored several of the scenes but ultimately only 8 of the 40 minutes it also had a newly remixed soundtrack that replaced many of the familiar sound effects which turned off many fans from that version to clarify there are 3 versions of stm available the 143 minute theatrical version the 151 minute expanded special edition and the 188 minute extended tv version this blu ray includes the 151 and 188 minute versions n nnow here we are in 2017 and warner archive has found a holy grail widescreen 35mm print of the tv version miraculously preserved in a vault cropped 16mm prints of the tv version have been in the hands of collectors for years but no one even suspected there was a widescreen 35mm version warner has meticulously transferred the print and done a lot of cleanup to produce a version that looks a hundred times better than the old 1983 version plus reveals 40 more picture because it is in widescreen it is a bit grainy in places but that is how film prints from that era look many classic films are overly scrubbed of grain which also removes some fine detail considering the age of the print 35 years and the fact it was never meant to be seen in high definition it looks very good and is more detailed than the special edition blu ray in some places n nthe audio is mostly in mono because that is how tv was broadcast back then warner did add stereo music to the main and end titles which leads me to the only negative aspect of this release they used the wrong version of the main title theme so it is jarringly and incorrectly edited i m sure this was done with good intentions but they should have just left it as the original mono directly from the tv version or lifted it from the soundtrack of the theatrical version still this is a minor complaint and wo n t be noticed by most viewers it does n t detract from what is an overall outstanding release n nhuge kudos to warner archive for releasing this and for doing a fantastic job with it highly recommended i hope they release the unique tv version of superman ii next
6;67;41;0.8596626667799393;what star wars did for science fiction and fantasy films superman did for comic book films in fact christopher nolan director of batman begins frequently credits superman with how to do comic book films correctly he wanted his own film to be on that level n n i was seven years old when i went and watched the movie as a young kid i was a huge fan of the old adventures of superman and ignorantly that s what i thought i was going to see a movie with all the characters from the television show i still recall walking out of the theater absolutely dumbfounded by such a fantastic film that made superman come alive it was the flying scenes that captivated me it looked so real to me especially compared to the dated effects of the television show n nthankfully an unknown actor christopher reeve was chosen to play the part in the extra features richard donner cites that reeve immersed himself in the part and even made his body move in such a way that you felt he was flying even though he was strapped into a harness n nas i ve stated in my smallville reviews the thing that makes superman so compelling is that clark kent is his disguise and superman is who he really is most heroes have it the other way around reeve also recognized that to pull off a realistic disguise he d have to act much differently as clark kent crediting cary grant as the man he borrowed his nerdy persona reeve successfully creates two separate identities it s believable that nobody would ever suspect the nerdy bumbling and clumsy clark kent was being the man of steel n nother performances in this film are very good gene hackman is great as lex luthor even though he decided to give luthor a decidedly humorous spin i still like michael rosenbaum s depiction the best from smallville but these are two different eras ned beatty is hilarious as luthor s bumbling henchman otis n nit s also great to see jackie cooper after all of these years from the our gang to take on the role of perry white he s great in the role as well giving white a fiesty side n nmargot kidder also does a good job as lois lane i had to admit that she was a pleasant surprise considering the women she beat out for the role such as lesly ann warren and cindy williams it speaks highly to her interpretation of the character n nit s nearly an hour before superman finally shows up but when he does it s a scene that even by today s standards still takes your breath away as he flies up to catch the falling lois lane with one hand and then catching the helicopter in the other n nyou simply ca n t mention the greatness of this film without talking about the timeless music of john williams the opening credits that start with one of williams signature pieces simply speaks to the power and grandeur of this cinematic masterpiece donner still recalls vividly of being literally speechless and feeling the hairs on his body stand up when he first heard john williams rendition n nif you re going to do a comic book movie you have to know the character unfortunately most people who attempt to do comic book films do n t know the character and the characters are only shadows of who they truly are the first four batman films are a testament to this sam raimi is an avid spider man reader and christopher nolan has also been a batman reader for quite some time richard donner also immersed himself in the world of superman to make sure that he made a film that stayed true to the character n nsuperman is the hero that all other heroes are compared to there is no other hero who retains such a mystique and grandeur of goodness and justice unlike batman who is driven by vengeance or even spider man who is driven by guilt and responibility superman is driven by a sense of trying to make the world as a whole a better place n nsuperman transcends the comic book world to be an american hero as well as he embodies all the things that we as americans hold nearest and dearest to ourselves this film gives us that superman

8;41;22;0.8307178280920555;i still have yet to get through all the extras but had to watch the extended version which includes a nice moment between kal el and his father following the first apperance of superman i love the selection of bonus footage including the audtion tapes for lois lane it will be obvious to one and all the margot kidder was the right choice i would like to know who else was up for any of the other parts i can not imagine a better lex luthor than gene hacknman even if he is as threatening as pee wee herman but this was never intended at least i believe to be seen as a real world we can sort of chuckle now at some of the corny lines christopher reeves delivers but he seemed truer to the comic book superman than this modern re imaginings where the fun of the character has been systematically squeezed out superman is a square and should remain that way i guess he might be considered the straight man in this universe i have yet to get to the george reeve superman meets the mole men it is very short and runs just under a hour i thought it was a feature length film released in theaters but it was probably bulked up by cartoons news reel footage etc i have already seen a few of the magnificent max fleisher superman carttons the storys are silly but the animation even though it is done by roto scoping is pretty spectacular as soon as though first few notes of the superman theme swell on the soundtrack i am fourteen years old age in 78 sitting in a dark movie theater anticipating the images to come and the tagline promise you will believe a man can fly goosebumps
9;3;15;0.8035768686760894;george lucas is a convenient scapegoat for those looking to cast blame upon the current state of revisionist cinema but in reality he was only giving a media obsessed culture more of what they want there is no final cut of a particular film anymore only a funhouse mirror of infinitely edited variations cut together whenever inspiration or marketing necessity strikes but lucas is simply a high profile target for creationist criticism in fact the studios have been suffering from special edition syndrome for nearly 50 years now n ncase in point the extended cut of richard donner s superman 1978 made its television premiere with over 40 minutes of story added to stretch the debut to a two night event some bits and pieces of this expanded footage has turned up in various incarnations of the film on home video over the years but we ve never had the full 188 minute epic released on hi def until now is it the final say on what many still consider to be the best superhero movie of all time or too much of a good thing n nas you might imagine it s a little of both n nsuperman was ahead of it s time from the get go considering donner actually shot both the original and most of the sequel featuring general zod and his evil cronies back to back before being replaced by richard lester and while donner s version of superman ii eventually saw the light of day again thanks to fan demand it was a compromised version of what could have been the new extended cut of the original still feels like donner s film just a more loose and organic version that depending on your point of view needs a bit of pruning n nit s difficult and tedious to point out exactly what s new here there are plenty of fan websites for that suffice to say that those additional 40 minutes are spread out amongst the entirety of the film resulting in scene extensions and casual character asides you might not even notice in fact a lot of the new footage is almost contextually invisible and that s a good thing there are very few moments that stick out as obvious add ons nothing that changes the mood or a motivations no greedo shoots first controversy to debate but it s also obvious which new scenes are unnecessary bits needed to be cut short for reasons of narrative content not commercial necessity in short superman the extended cut is the same film only longer and in an era of rejiggered reimagined and often completely reinvented restorations that s particularly satisfying all by itself n nwarner archive s blu ray edition offers up all the new material in seamless high definition there s no noticeable change in quality from one scene to the next and the 2 film collection in throws in the special edition of superman the movie previously released on blu for comparisons sake all of the previous special features for that one are carried over including donner s commentary three documentaries screen tests additional scenes and a music only track of john williams iconic score
10;2;19;0.7722867871831013;i have seen the 3 hour television cut and the tone is very different now in general there is n t any real new scenes what we get is scene extensions most of what is cut from each scene is the comedy element this was a wise choice i think some thing could have been left in but the film was over 2 hours long when it was released in 1978 the average length for a film was under 2 hours the most exciting part of this version is the extensions of the krypton scenes now out of all the new scenes i would of kept in 1 there is an added element of a guard going to jor el home to arrest him to say more would be wrong 2 during the chasing rockets segment there is an added bit that i love where one of the rockets just goes around superman 3 another great moment is where jimmy olsen is picked up by superman and he photographs the hoover dam falling apart i am glad this version is being released fans can finally see it it is also nice to see why they were cut to begin with
11;21;3;0.7705991870659752;firstly this review is for the superman the move extended cut blu ray tv version 188mins expanded discs because for some reason amazon reviews are jumbled up with other superman the move previous releases n nas a child i originally saw superman in 1978 in the theatre cinema and was completely blown away from start to finish and easily became one of my favourite films of all time along side the original 1977 star wars film was n t it brilliant back then in the 1970s of people of a certain age boy just fantastic special effects may be dated in places but are more organic and solid than the over the top cgi of today s age n ni wo n t go into the storyline but theatrical version is well paced with drama action and adventure through space to farm to city christopher reeve performance as the man of steel clark kent is the definitive in my eyes all the nolstalgic actors actresses all excell n ni remember collecting the full set of superman trading cards and always wonder why certain pictures did not featured in the cinema version it was n t until the early 1980s i read a review in leonard martins film guide book that he mentions there was a two night tv version with around 40mins of deleted footage added to the then 1982 abc tv network in the us that featured those pictures in the trading cards back then there was no internet you found info in books and widely published magazines like starburst as far as i know the extended cut was shown only in the us in the early 1980s and a even longer cut to 188mins in 1994 and subsequently in australia and ireland n nfans out there who recorded various versions on vhs or obtained 16mm film did put together an available 188mins cut for sale or download free over the years i managed to obtain this years ago on dvd vhs quality i thought the extended cut was absolutely brilliant with the expanded scenes and deleted cuts especially when superman flies at different angles and wonder why they were cut from the theatrical version i can understand for time constraints and pacing that alot of scenes were not used in the cinema version and suitable for tv as to why the original producers made the tv versions for viewing financial reasons but i m glad they did made these versions or we would have never seen or heard about them general public fans over the decades until maybe the dvd blu ray age as extras n nhistorically the original film source tv version cut seemed lost forever and patching up to match them from scratch i imagined would have required locating original film negatives and restoration as richard donnor did in his expanded 2000 release but out of the blue as i recently read prior to this blu ray release the widescreen full length tv version was found in some warner archive vault and now we can fully enjoy the actual extended cut in hd blu ray albeit restored sound visuals where necessary i understand unknown to a majority of people fans but probally die hard fans of superman a certain take involving lex and ottis clammering around when the ambulance van doors are flung open seems shorter which was actually the edit used in the 1982 tv abc version and a longer one in an international tv broadcast a downloaded version made by a fan called restored international cut included the longer one with lex and ottis as opposed to the original tv broadcast in 1982 which also did n t include christopher reeve marlon brando scene in the fortress of solitude after superfeats i guess pan scan and edit cut downs were used to form from the 188mins widescreen recentley discovered were used in the original 1982 tv network broadcast interesting stuff though i personally think this blu ray release is as good as it gets n nfor most of us the tv extended cut is virtually new and discovered or even unheard of until now it s availability on blu ray disc nfrom my own experience i thought i saw everyithing having been used to the pan scan tv average quality but was blown away like being a child again by this fantastic widescreen version with scenes i obviously have n t seen in my life overall brilliant 3 hours or so flew by nthe picture quality is unique to it s own compared to the theatrical expanded release in a positive way i m glad they kept the original sound with enhanced spacial mono where dialogue music cues special effects are clear and in my oppinon done well the opening end credits include true stereo that blends in well into the film n nmy only quarm i have with this release is that like so many of the superman dvd blu ray cover design they are too generic they should have used the original uk 1978 uk art poster buy hey i m probally being picky n nnote though this is a warner archives release only available on demand via online sellers and not in shops this is a geniune blu ray manufactured disc like any other commercial chart busting film release quality disc and not a b d r it is also region free and should play on worldwide players n nthankyou to you guys at warner bros archives for this tv version on blu ray n na brilliant must buy
12;10;12;0.7556236393694092;the television cut is great to have not having seen it since it was on tv and i was 8 it now though pretty much denecessitates probably not a word but it sounds right the 2000 expanded edition everything added to that version is in the tv cut therefore this would have been an excellent package had it included the theatrical cut as well or instead also i had the 2006 5 1 dolby digital blu ray so i was glad to finally have it in dts hd ma sound and now that pretty much all known footage shot for this film has been released a pristine theatrical cut to accompany it would have been awesome the tv cut on the other hand looks great other than a couple audio glitches during the opening credits and i think one more later the audio is the original audio sound mix which is cool all the extra scenes are cool but they also make you appreciate stuart bairds editing for the theatrical cut which definitely helps with pace its nice to finally have the tv cut looking and sounding great its a fine release
13;19;8;0.7546893408029614;well i am surprised like everybody else that warner brothers would go out of their way to release superman the tv version on blu ray i was delighted to see it and it is interesting when you compare it to the special edition i hope that they decide to do the same thing with superman 2 even though superman 2 is a little more complicated since they added a flyby scene of superman flying by a jet liner left over from superman the first film and scenes filmed for superman 2 from richard donner inerwolven with richard lesters cut of the film i have a boot leg of both superman the tv version and superman 2 the tv version on dvd the quality of the two leave a lot to be desired so basically i am saying is that u am glad that they took the time to release the tv version of superman on blu ray
14;15;5;0.736005677694711;i think the year was 1980 or 81 after completing its amazing theatrical run superman the movie finally got its world television premiere and was aired as a two night special event being a kid having seen it in theaters in late 78 i was stoked to watch it again spread out over that sunday evening and then that following monday night more footage was presented that supposedly warner bros left on the editing floor yet i could ve sworn those minor scenes were in the original theatrical showing well no matter because after all these decades i m so happy to now own that long extended tv cut in 2000 we were graced to receive director richard donner s definitive cut of the 143 min film with eight added minutes this new version is just over three hours long 188 min there s more detail added making for a stronger narrative more to the destruction of krypton insight into the life of teenage clark kent his adult life as superman lex luthor s criminal machinations etc this is the most definitive most fleshed out version we ll ever see watching this longer version reminds me of how much fun i had seeing this on tv all those years ago but no matter what version is shown superman still holds up as great timeless entertainment n nhopefully now we can get the extended cuts to superman ii and iii as well
15;33;21;0.7326454697737836;i m so grateful to christopher reeve for playing his role with seriousness and integrity instead of making fun of it that set the ntone for the whole production actors scenery special effects artistic creativity and especially john william s music to regale us with na powerful optimistic thrilling story that lives deep in our subconscious and which most of us would love to be true nand there s a charming memory i have regarding the movie i d like to share back in the late 70 s while walking east on 42nd nstreet on my way home after work there was a huge crowd milling between 2nd and 3rd ave everybody was looking up and nshouting and there on top of the daily news building all brilliantly lit up was a helicopter perched precariously on the edge of the roof it was very frightening i never heard another thing about the event and then the next year the movie superman came out nand there it was
16;4;17;0.7297324030958896;superman the movie the extended tv version is finally officially released and in hd quality nthe tv version was broadcasted over 2 night s back in the early 80 s about 90 mins each night nbut with commercials makes it 2hr time slot each night nwell finally warners have officially released it on blu ray i can throw my old vhs copy out now nit s paired with richard donner s 151min cut on disc 2 that s 145min then the end credits starts nwith all the special features taken from the old special edition dvd set nhere s my comments on the picture sound quality nwell the tv version was screened in 1 33 1 ratio but to my big surprise warners have widen the ratio to 2 40 1 theatrical presentation nso both 145min the longer 188min is both 2 40 1 ratio nwarners have made lots effort with picture quality the tv version looks excellent about 9 10 nthe sound quality is only 2 0 master stereo mix maybe 6 10 which is better than the old mono sound of course nit was very emotional watching all the extra scenes inserted back in compared to watching it on grainy 1 33 1 vhs nmost of the extra scenes inserted back into the tv version were first digitally restored as extras on the old special edition dvd nthe richard donner cut is 145mins so i believe the many extra scenes are about 30mins more nso at 180min roughly then the end credits start making the run time 188min nso you have a choice either still watch 145 151min version or just watch the full 180min version nit s matter of personal taste really n5 stars for this new reissue based on a milestone event of the longer extended cut now officially released to buy
17;28;20;0.7023903064452601;for me this will always be the definitive superman movie christopher reeve may he rest in peace is superman he ll always be superman to several generations now and into the future and although some of the effects are noticeably dated one can not but be awed by the cinematography especially in the early farm scenes in smallville beautifully shot with majestic landscapes you truly have to appreciate something with such scope from a superhero film made in the 1970s although the budget ballooned you can really see the amount of love and detail put into this movie it still holds up to the test of time witty banter excellent chemistry between christopher margot and gene the rockets still look believable and lois tragic fate still scares the crap outta me i simply have to give this movie a watch every year nothing will ever come close to john williams original score as well richard donner s name as well as the talented crew behind this movie will always go down as being ahead of their time simply incredible
18;17;10;0.6562818285420405;i waited 35 years to watch this again nthis is the most uncut edition you will ever find of superman the movie nwith all of the footage it fills in alot of the storyline for a greater understanding of the movie na must have nthis should have been the original theater verison in my opinion it never should have been cut to begin with
19;7;7;0.6556698393612752;i just watched the 3 hour extended cut and loved it but i did notice one small difference i was watching my dads vhs recording of the tv extended cut and there is a shot that is missing it takes place when lex is yelling at otis in the van in the blu ray we see miss teschmacher driving but on my dad s vhs recording we see otis hanging from the back with the door open
20;20;2;0.4470129408470452;super greatness first time i ever watched the 3hr version includes many cut scenes some not so important while others super fantastic and should ve been included in the theatrical version the special edition version is also great if you want to watch supermen but 40min less

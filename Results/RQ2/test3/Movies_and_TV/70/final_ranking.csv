0;6;24;0.9179870982783981;carnival of souls is one of my favorite kinds of movie the low budget horror film that manages to unnerve and create a world of mystery and possibilities despite and sometimes even because of its lack of funding it s the only feature film made by the late herk harvey and despite a lackluster initial release it has become increasingly popular over the years it ponders the question when the emotionally dead actually die do they even notice n none of the director s best decisions was to take a considerable amount of his meager budget and spend it on a quality yet unknown leading actress in candace hilligoss she certainly was perfect for the lead role of mary henry she is excellent at portraying someone who is emotionally hollow who has ironically chosen something that generally attracts people of passion music as a profession in the hands of a less able actress mary s largely deadpan demeanor would have simply appeared to be the work of an actress who was unclear about her motivation harvey knew instinctively that poor acting in a low budget horror film always takes the viewer out of the proper element and instead makes the film campy which is definitely not a word that describes this movie n nthe film opens when a car filled with guys challenges a car filled with girls to a drag race drag races in movies rarely yield anything but tragic outcomes and in this case the girls car plunges off the side of a bridge and disappears into the murky river below as the local law enforcement attempt to drag the river complaining because of its current height and low visibility that the car might never be found one of the victims mary henry crawls out of the water covered in muck and obviously in a stupor but physically unharmed she remembers nothing about the accident in spite of this tragedy she continues with her plans to move west to salt lake city where she s been offered a job as a church organist while on the trip west an eerie ghoulish face and figure who looks a lot like uncle fester of the addams family begins to appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as suddenly and nobody seems able to see him except for her n nshe takes a boarding room just down the hall from john sidney berger who quickly tries to put the moves on her with all of the finesse of a pimply faced high school sophomore berger was always proud of the fact that film critic roger ebert called him the definitive portrait of a nerd in lust mary sometimes rejects john but sometimes welcomes his company just because she s beginning to fear being alone considering the random appearances of the ghoulish figure mary is not the kind of person who needs people for companionship instead unless they fulfill a concrete requirement like a car or a coffeemaker or in john s case something that wards off the ghoul that stalks her she is largely indifferent to their presence n nan abandoned carnival ground on the outskirts of town catches mary s attention and she begins to be drawn toward it as though that strange setting might offer some sort of answer to her mystery what follows is two terrific set pieces one involving her practicing her music in church only to be overcome by visions and a mysterious power that turns her playing into something profane that gets her fired from her job and the first of two eerie scenarios where mary seems to have become invisible and inaudible to all around her the ending might have been considered surprising in 1962 but today it s pretty obvious from the beginning what is probably going on in this movie however the entertainment is in the journey not the destination n nwhat harvey lacked in finances for special effects he more than made up for in atmosphere which cost him monetarily little or nothing his undead creatures are startling to look at and the way he films their bizarre macabre dances is both strange and unnerving when he claimed his influences were jean cocteau and ingmar bergman he was n t kidding fans of those directors will notice how much homage is paid to them in this film and how much those were the right two filmmakers to emulate to create the surreal mood of this particular picture also the unforgettable organ score by gene moore is perfect for adding just the right mood to this film n nthe original version of the picture had five minutes cut out of it by harvey s distributor simply to make the movie fit better on a double feature billing with this dvd you can compare that version with the restored director s cut and i believe that the latter is definitely the better one most of what was cut came from two scenes near the end the second adventure of invisibility for mary and the final confrontation at the carnival grounds harvey s version is decidedly creepier with a much better flow to it n ncarnival of souls was one of the first truly good low budget out of the mainstream classic horror films the next one would be 1968 s night of the living dead by george romero this movie proves that talent vision and imagination can triumph over funding to create something lasting memorable and unique who would have thought that a film that cost only 30k to make would have people talking philosophically about the dividing line between life and death over 40 years later how many of the films made in the last five years that cost 100 million to make will have the same effect on audiences 40 years from now i doubt many if any will
1;59;26;0.9065010572276089;two cars drag race on a desolate stretch of road in rural kansas one car runs off a bridge plunges into a deep river and quickly sinks all three young women inside are assumed dead however hours after the crash one woman emerges from the river alive and unharmed but unable or unwilling to explain her miraculous survival n nthat intriguing premise ladies and gentlemen is merely the pre credits opening sequence of carnival of souls n ni had n t heard of this movie before however quick trips to imdb and wikipedia tell me that i should have it was an cheap obscure throwaway flick when it was first released but has gained a cult following in the decades since and it s easy to see why because despite its flaws there is a lot of atmosphere and horror here n nthe story follows mary henry candace hilligoss the young woman inexplicably left alive when all reason would indicate that she be dead following the accident she leaves town as she has been hired as a church organist in utah during her trip she is haunted by bizarre and unexplainable visions after her arrival the sightings continue and she finds herself drawn to a mysterious abandoned carnival also despite making a serious impression on a man living in her building she begins temporarily slipping out of reality unable to make herself seen or heard by those around her n ni m not the first nor will i be the last to notice that carnival of souls has the definite feel of a lost elongated episode of the twilight zone indeed it contains similar themes to the hitchhiker although carnival is creepier and has more going on this is very atmospheric very creepy and unsettling it s the kind of movie you watch and then do n t want to look out of dark windows at night because if you do n t look you wo n t have to see what s out there n ni liked that the central character is both an identification point we like her want to discover what is going on around her and a enigmatic mystery how did she survive the car crash that event must have something to do with her visions but what is the connection why is she drawn to the carnival n nof course i found it difficult to watch carnival without being distracted by the cheap production values and numerous technical flaws while occasionally the mistakes add to the atmosphere of confusion overall they ca n t help but detract from the film as a whole keep in mind that this film gets a lot of attention based on how good it is despite its flaws so do n t go into it expecting perfection n nhowever those flaws almost enhance the genuinely effective moments because they seem to rise like roses out of well if not manure than certainly ordinary film making there are many creepy individual shots i ll remember most of which concern the unnerving ghostly apparitions sometimes simple primitive special effects are more chilling than there expensive counterparts and the shots of the specters stalking the protagonist are clear evidence of that n ni really enjoyed the ending of the film sometimes a script will attempt to explain too much leaving the movie feeling a little too neat other times the producers will leave things so vague as to render any coherent theory impossible carnival hit the magic median for me i got a lot out of the ending and was happy to see that while there are numerous theories on line explaining the conclusion not one of them exactly lines up with my own i like that about a film n nthe inexpensive digiview productions release of this dvd is quite watchable and while i m sure the criterion version has a vastly superior picture this is great for people like me who are discovering this for the first time
2;18;33;0.8995082401488953;one of the best things about carnival of souls is the way the sound and music create the film s atmosphere the first organ chords that open the film with shots of the river s murky surface foreshadow a later diegetic appearance of the same music the magnified sound of the boards of the fateful wooden bridge ratchet up the eeriness of the mood and echo the distorted sound of mary henry s footsteps when toward the end in her last terrified flight through the town the clacking of her heels on the street takes on a strange and unreal rhythm n nafter the accident we see mary henry from above from the point of view of the crowd on the bridge she crawls out of the muddy water where the police have been dragging for the car which had earlier plunged from the bridge this is the first of many times that she is viewed from an overhead angle the second time we see her from such a height is at the organ manufacturing warehouse from the balcony where several of the workers lured away from their various jobs as if hypnotized by her music have gathered to see her practicing in this scene we learn that she is leaving for salt lake city to take a job as a church organist the installation supervisor wishes her luck and tells her put your soul into it a little ok spot the low budget dialog ok n nan interesting sound device occurs next in the car en route to salt lake city we discover that the music we hear is not coming from the radio as we had thought because as she turns the dials nothing happens the source of the music appears puzzling to her as well hilligoss is stunning here crazy eyed her face in ecu lit by otherworldly light n n the film was made in 1962 and so we never see a pack of marlboros or a can of pepsi but when mary henry arrives at the rooming house in salt lake city and we meet the landlady mrs thomas she happens to be carrying a can of ajax quite amusing n nmost of the scenes are tense as mary is often in claustrophobic spaces inside her car or with the cloying mr linden the neighbor who continually forces into her space with his hands face and body later the minister too crowds her in the blocked area behind the organ the first peaceful scene is the one where she first visits the abandoned fairground which inexplicably draws her again we see her from high above when she enters the pavilion n nprobably the most important scene in the film occurs when mary visits the empty church to practice she starts out with all the correct organ music pauses to look at her hands as if they do n t belong to her and resumes but now the music changes it becomes the haunted carnivalesque score building on what we d heard briefly in the opening scene gene moore is credited with the music and it s superb has anything been written anywhere about this did it influence the opening of led zeppelin s your time is gon na come she s become one with the organ and we see her bare feet floating over the pedals rows of choir robes shiver disembodied on their hangers we see images of clouds over the moon then reflected in the water saints frozen in the stained glass and dancers in the pavilion in compressed time i think this is really an amazing cinematic moment it ends when the minister bursts on this scene horrified he s heard all this and shrieks profane sacrilege he blurts out that he pities her for her lack of soul and instantly banishes her from the church firing her from her job as church organist forever n nthere is a particularly sublime shot in the film to watch for it occurs in the scene of mary henry s final visit to the pavilion there is a long shot of the ballroom dancers in the dark pavilion embracing and motionless entangled with the long dangling streamers this is count one counts two three and four occur like this the strings of lights illuminate the music starts and the dancers begin the lights the music and the motion occur with a cadence so deliberate and careful as though counted out by metronome and as if to suggest that everything will happen in order as it should no need to hurry no need to run this time we see mary from a low angle the sky behind her instead of the ground
3;42;18;0.8531089685368591;get ready cause this is gon na get complicated real fast lol n nokay so you have both criterion and image entertainment releasing the same movie in the same year a film that until then had only known cruddy public domain hell on tv 0 99 vhs and 1 99 dvd s and with pretty much the same remastered picture quality right n nwell here s where it gets very odd the criterion set has two versions of the film a 78 minute theatrical version and an 83 minute director s cut where as the image entertainment dvd has a running time of 82 minutes note all of the actual discs corroborate the dvd cases printed running times n nso one would assume that the image disc was culled from the same print used to create the criterion director s cut seeing as the run times are so close and as previously mentioned the prints look very much the same n n but you would be wrong n nthe reason being is that both of the criterion versions have a scene near the beginning of the film where a police detective person is interviewing the driver of the second car in the opening drag race asking the driver his version of the events on the bridge but this scene is absent from the image version n nnow granted this is a little 10 second scene but it dose rise the question as to where image got this pristine print from as there are no restoration notes on the image packaging and why does it very from the theatrical version in this one scene possibly others as well but i ve yet to do any serious frame by frame comparisons to all three films because well i do have a life lol n nthe scene in question is actually quite redundant as we already have witnessed the events on the bridge and know what happened and it s non inclusion in the image version is seamlessly done making it look for all the world like the scene was an added scene for the director s cut of the criterion version but since this scene is also in the theatrical cut one has to wonder once again where the image print came from and how much more is different between the three versions for that matter n nthen there s the running time issues as you would assume that the image dvd would be the theatrical cut possibly licensed from criterion to provide a cheap alternative to the criterion set as was done with the movie zombi which both blue underground and shriek show paid to have the film restored and one put out a low priced movie only dvd at the same time that the other put out a two disc special edition version but where as the theatrical cut is 78 minutes and it s director s cut is 83 minutes the image disc is 82 minutes and is missing at least one scene that both the theatrical and director s cuts have n nthis is curious and just thought that fans might want to know or might even have some ideas as to the nature of the image dvd
4;15;15;0.8506168069857086;warning some spoilers ahead n nthis single carnival of souls 1962 dvd contains both the original black and white movie and a colorized version as well if you re in the mood for color watch the color version if you want the black and white original it s here too when it comes to cult classics of the horror genre i lump carnival of souls into the same category as night of the living dead 1968 this movie had an extremely low budget it was made for 30 000 or 17 000 depending on the source whatever it was it was dirt cheap to make but in my opinion sometimes low budget movies are better than the polished big budget movies with top of the line actors and special effects when it comes to horror movies a small amount of money can produce the same desired result as big budget movies which is to scare the audience the goal is to create an eerie and spooky and scary atmosphere that taps into a person s feelings of fear you really do n t need a lot of money to accomplish this a lot of low budget b horror movies are very effective carnival of souls is one of them n nthis movie was shot in lawrence kansas and also at the saltair pavilion amusement park in salt lake city utah this movie stars candace hilligoss as mary henry a church organist who survives a car accident in which her two girl companions died throughout the movie she often sees the ghostly image of a man played by director herk harvey practically everywhere she goes this man seems to be haunting her nobody else but her sees this man it is n t long before she seems to become non existent to the people around her all of whom do n t see or hear her mary seems to be scared of unknown forces throughout the movie it also seems as if what is living and what is dead is a blur to her she ca n t tell the difference she basically is caught between the living and the dead she is even haunted by her own organ music which changes from happier tones early in the movie to more sinister and darker tones while she s practicing at the church one night it seems as though ever since she saw the saltair pavilion for the first time she became drawn to it the end of the movie has a bizarre ending that i wo n t reveal watch it to find out what happens n nthis movie s score is 100 theater organ performed by gene moore that s it an organ the organ music is eerie throughout the movie and seems to be off key a lot of the time intentionally of course and has an underlying subtle carnival melody during a lot of the scenes at the pavilion i must say i m surprised that candace hilligoss only appeared in one other movie the curse of the living corpse in 1964 she is nice looking has very good screen presence and can act pretty well n nthis movie can be classified as having subtle atmospheric psychological horror this movie has no blood and gore instead the music camera angles lighting howling winds shadows moonlight clouds and feeling of emptiness make this movie creepy n nthis movie has been influential to many horror movie makers including george romero david lynch and john carpenter notice how the ghoul the man who keeps haunting mary appears in windows and then disappears michael myers does the same thing in halloween 1978 n nthe audio commentary by mike nelson of tv s mystery science theater 3000 is obnoxious and useless he s a funny guy but his commentary is pointless for this dvd release n ndo you like low budget b horror movies that are influential cult classics do you like simplicity when it comes to horror movies do you like horror movies involving carnivals if so then check out carnival of souls and buy this dvd where you get both black and white and color

6;54;17;0.7823244193288094;i love this movie i saw this film a while ago the criterion collection edition and was amazed by the interesting storyline and the film is just over an hour so it s a fast paced story n nherk harvey and john clifford came up with an interesting concept mary henry candace hilligoss gets into what should have been a fatal car accident during a drag race she is uneasy in town but she is leaving anyways to take a job as a church organist although to her its just a job and the church is a place of business on her way there she is stalked by a ghostly ghastly man scarily played by herk himself she becomes even more paranoid when it appears as though people treat her like she does n t exist the story comes to a thrilling conclusion with visually stunning scenes at the old carnival n ni can not explain why i like this film i just do i think the colorization is actually well done i have yet to listen to the humorous commentary so i can not rate that although if you have the extra money i would go for the criterion collection the film is cleaned up so the great cinematography at the end is crisp as well as having the director s cut n nbut this copy more than satisfies my cult obsession with a low budget masterpiece highly recommend
7;36;13;0.7765669025894342;i saw this at least 45 years ago and was so horrified that it stuck in my mind like a nightmare i have literally not seen it since then and was anticipating seeing it with great delight i can say without reservation that this is one of the best b horror films that i have ever seen the actors are unknowns and often not that good but there is a consistent mood of terror and morbid curiosity throughout n nan inhibited girl is in a accident that occurred while recklessly racing boys somehow after 3 hours submerged she appears to the astonishment of the cops who are looking for the car from the get go she senses that something is wrong but decides to go to a new job across the country without visiting her parents first on the way she starts seeing things in particular a recognizable face upon arrival she feels this terrible unease the whole place seems alien and almost threatening she meets a lively somewhat drunken boy who rooms across the hall a kind of connection to life that she feels is vital yet can not accept their alienation after a brief mating dance is very sad n nstrange things keep happening she develops a fascination with an abandoned amusement park which she feels compelled to explore alone after a strange interlude where she appears to no longer exist no one can hear or see her she meets a stiff psychotherapists who tries to help but asks the wrong questions he concludes that she is unusually strong willed n nshe is a church organist on her first job her music forms an integral part of the horrific atmospherics of the film indeed she loses control and improvises a bizarre tune with swirling uncontrolled hands as images of dancing corpses so similar to the tubercular melancholy of munch s nordic paintings overwhelm her i have seen this image in my nightmares ever since her soulless music disturbs the priest who hired her he is the other moral pole opposite the psychotherapist as she begins to accept that she does n t belong in the town the menacing otherworlders began to appear in full daylight at times she has fleeting visions or herself among them it bores straight into the viewers subconscious fear of the mysteries of death i will not reveal the ending n nrecommended with enthusiasm there is a reason this is called a cult classic
8;14;7;0.6551073755927475;very nice blu ray transfer of this movie criterion did an outstanding job as usual the previous dvd of this by criterion had a theatrical and directors cut of the movie but the blu ray has just the theatrical cut still worth getting for the quality

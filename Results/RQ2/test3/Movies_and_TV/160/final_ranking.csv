0;12;66;0.9076454529484742;this is clearly one of the most polarising of jane austen adaptations on film some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting the authentically costumed characters the beautiful scenery and sets the incredible story telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film others will loathe the complete absence of makeup the fact that amanda root is visibly older than 29 the slow and tender story the use of natural lighting and the re writing of the mr elliot sub plot including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards mrs smith n ni acknowledge both of these views certainly amanda root does not enhance her natural sweet looks and she does look a little too old for the part of anne elliot but mon dieu her acting that is something else again in terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character no better actress could have been found if only she d been permitted to youthify her looks a little after all in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl although it s true her looks had faded somewhat her appearance revives mid way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen but to be honest i do prefer superb acting to superb looks and that is why i find amanda root s portrayal so very moving and real n nciarn hinds is excellent as captain wentworth anne s love whose proposal she rejected some years ago he is not movie star handsome but a well looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes in personality and character he is undeniably the right match for ms root s anne the interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach he is very deliberately ignoring anne although with perfect politeness more and more the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them and the beauty of anne s character is so wonderfully brought out by amanda root s acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised n nthe sub plots are also superbly explicated anne s selfish and heedless father corin redgrave and monstrously insensitive and vain sister elizabeth phoebe nicholls not to mention her laughably tiresome sister mary sophie thompson are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on anne s behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour mr elliot the brilliant samuel west does n t really get enough storytime in this adaption unfortunately i do think the script did n t quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character but the wonderful fiona shaw is perfect in the role of mrs croft anne s put upon friend who has fallen upon hard times and lady russell anne s mentor is just sheer delight in her well meaning snobbery as played by susan fleetwood i also found absolutely perfect the self seeking mrs clay felicity dean and the thoroughly nice charles musgrove who having been rejected by anne decided to wed mary instead very very well played by simon russell beale who makes this sort of role look completely effortless n nthe look of this film is lovely in many ways the lack of makeup may take some getting used to but there s no denying it s authentic and with such excellent acting from everyone involved the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed n nthe truly magnificent singing of opera singer rosa mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any jane austen film all too often the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly quite nice but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class or if no natural talent was possessed perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing but music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces n nto sum up for those who want a film that is purely escapist that is full of lovely looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is exciting to watch this is probably not a film that will appeal to you for those however who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances there will be great enjoyment for you
1;26;114;0.8997971752337108;persuasion the film is a faithful adaptation of jane austen s final completed novel and to my mind her finest book it is directed with subtlety and brilliance by roger michell the film is quite able to stand alone on its own merits you do n t have to know ms austen s work to be captivated by the pure magic of the romance the regency english period history brilliant characterizations color music and costumes of this extraordinary drama brought to life on the screen the movie deals with the same social issues as the book especially the british class system rigid social barriers existed and everyone wanted to marry up to a higher station and into wealth this is also a very poignant and passionate tale of love disappointment loss and redemption the point is clearly that one should n t ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs especially for ignoble goals there are consequences always nsir walter elliot lord of kellynch hall is an extravagant self aggrandizing snob and a bit of a dandy to boot he has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature his eldest daughter who he dotes on is as conceited and spoiled as he is the youngest daughter anne amanda root is an intelligent sensitive capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the film begins she had been quite pretty at one time but life s disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading she and her sister are both single anne had once been very much in love with a young and as yet untried navel officer a woman who had been a close friend to anne s mother persuaded anne to call off the engagement convincing her that she could make a much better match after much consideration anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts and she and her young officer frederick wentworth ciaran hinds separated she has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him nthe elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance they lease kellynch hall to of all people wentworth s sister and her husband elliot his oldest daughter and her companion move to a smaller lodging in bath for the season leaving anne to pack up their belongings before joining them she gets the cinderella treatment throughout the film anne chooses this time to visit with her middle sister an abominably spoiled whiny hypochondriac mrs musgrove she has made a good but not brilliant match to a local squire charles muskgrove her husband his parents and their two younger eligible daughters louisa and henrietta are delightful there are wonderfully warm scenes of family and friends dining dancing hiking over the gorgeous countryside and at the seashore that bring the audience smack into early 19th century english life it is at the muskgrove estate that anne meets frederick wentworth again after his absence of seven years he is in the neighborhood because his sister is now in the area residing at kellynch of course wentworth is now a captain in the royal navy and quite wealthy when their eyes meet for the first time you can absolutely feel anne s longing and remorse intense i can not imagine a better actress to play anne than amanda root she slowly transforms herself from a sallow aging spinster to a luminescent woman in love and this is not just the makeup wentworth hinds is aloof with anne although civil the man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels the sting of her snub now wentworth is on the marriage market and louisa sets her cap for him accidents and various adventures ensue from the resorts of lyme and bath to the muskgrove estate bringing anne and wentworth closer together the passion between the two is palpable although very understated this is regency england after all if ms root is the perfect anne then mr hinds is the best possible wentworth he is as large and virile as she is petite and feminine he oozes sexuality but again he portrays his character with great subtlety the entire production is brilliantly cast and the acting is superb ni think this is ms austen s most passionate piece some scholars say that she modeled anne elliot after herself nthis remarkable film like the novel and the issues it tackles is just as germane today as it was when written each time i view it it just gets better and the romance well no one does romance better than jane austen
2;128;147;0.8723382126611102;although it does not compete with the elegance of the theatrical releases of sense sensibility and emma this 1996 bbc films production of persuasion has its own place in the jane austen revival of the past decade with anne elliot amanda root and captain wentworth ciarn hinds we have the longest suffering set of lovers in all of austen s domestic novels eight years early anne had been persuaded by a snobbish friend of the family to reject wentworth as a suitor since he was a young naval officer with no prospects but now the financial fortunes of both parties are reversed with the elliots on the verge of bankruptcy and wentworth a successful captain in the war against napoleon but their feelings for each other are unchanged it is just a question of when the two lovers will figure this out nroot and hinds both members of the royal shakespeare company bring the requisite maturity to their roles anne elliot is the quintessential austen old maid with a resigned acceptance of her fate and an inherent dignity in the face of life s little quirks that makes the happy ending all the more enjoyable this is one of those steady unremarkable performances where you really forget root is acting she simply is anne hinds has a marvelous scene where he puts aside the requirements of polite society to tell off the woman who thwarted his happiness as is a requirement with all bbc period piece productions the supporting cast is superb especially sophie thompson as anne s hypochondriac sister mary this is another one of those austen literary families where the heroine is the only worthwhile one in the lot nto me the most intriguing part of this adaptation is that it manages to incorporate both austen s original and revised endings for the novel i must admit that i prefer the revised ending because for once she has the reconciliation of the two lovers be the result of one of them having the courage to tell the other one how they feel albeit in a letter rather than face to face this was certainly quite different from austen s usual tack of them accidentally learning about their true feelings for each other e g pride and prejudice i always considered this to be evidence of austen s maturity as a writer but unfortunately the work was published posthumously
3;127;32;0.8599910221528456;amazon reviewers in noticeably large numbers are wholly in the right for lavishly praising this bbc version of jane austen s final novel of the spate of austen adaptations released in the past two decades it s arguable that this particular one is the finest first of all it takes striking advantage of tv s being so good a medium for the adaptation of manners novels pretty much void of grand vistas this version focuses on expressive close ups raised eyebrows revelatory tete a tetes and the tinkle of teacups amanda root is wonderfully adept at showing us the painful consequences of anne elliot s refusal of captain wentworth years earlier her face in the early scenes is one with an appropriately faded bloom and her unhappiness is signaled through her nervous furtive glances and the almost cringing manner in which she enters rooms she is the consummate solitary heroine of this potentially tragic mature austen novel at home she experiences what has been called the tyranny of neglect being regularly passed over or unexpectedly offered to others for use by her self absorbed father and older sister the tinkle of teacups in these family scenes reveals to the shrewd observer that some of the hands holding the cups might as well have been claws and the noses snouts jane austen clearly in this film is revealed as a specialist both in domestic humor and domestic horror with the exception of anne herself the other elliots inadvertently illustrate the truth in g b shaw s witty paradox that the human family is the greatest instrument of torture the race has so far devised n nthe lyme scenes of the story are especially well handled a combination of the fresh sea air and a growing restoration in the returned wentworth s good opinion combine to change amanda root s face to one of bright eyed hope after all hope has been lost also the encounters here between anne and the heartbroken captain benwick have been successfully dramatized and are moving in their rich irony having lost his beloved phoebe but ignorant of anne s own lost love benwick tells anne she can not understand what he has lost she responds beautifully and powerfully with the quiet rejoinder oh but i can n nif the film has any flaws i would say they lie in the denouement which is truncated and rather abrupt and in the characterization of sir walter and his oldest daughter elizabeth these two elliots are too monotonously drawn in their repetitive self absorbtion the father caring only for looks and the daughter for rank on the other hand mary the hypochondriac elliot middle sister played with great skill by sophie thompson is a wholly successful characterization being more than one dimensional in her awfulness and thus more unwittingly comical she s a snob and doting mother as well as a hypochondriac but these flaws after all are relatively small ones when taken in conjunction with the understanding and respect for the novel this adaptation shows and for the excellence of the acting in evidence throughout

6;121;130;0.8473734446052206;do n t let my rating of 3 stars mislead anyone this is a good movie there is no fault to be found with the story line the movie sticks fairly close the the original jane austen novel while taking a few acceptable creative liscences with the plot it is wonderfully cast almost perfectly cast to be precise and it is shot beutifully the scenery is inspiring and the costumes are elegant without being overdone however i have some complaints about the quality of this production needless to say this story deserved better then what was done to it first of all the story starts so slow that i could barely keep my interest i find this a screenplay error the original novel does n t start out so dully and slowly luckily the plot picks up after about half an hour and the rest of the story was wonderful romatic and interesting secondly the sound on the entire procuction is terrible in almost every key point in the plot i had to turn the volume to the maximum just to try and hear what the characters were saying and even then i could barely understand them during the climax of the movie which involves one of the most moving and romantic love letters ever written two voices read it at the same time making the letter incomprehensible i had to rewind the video and watch it at least three times before i understood what the letter even said poorly done for a movie where dialogue is the driving force for the movie more attention should have been given to sound quality the good news is that i was at least interested enough in the movie to be drawn into reading the book which was a million times better and a lot more interesting so i must give that credit where credit is due my basic opinion of this movie is that it was a good idea and well done from the standpoint of the story but more time should have been given to certain production details the lack of such attention only frustrated me as a viewer when it was clear the movie was a good one
7;83;127;0.8473396198775213;i ve seen my fair share of period romances and i think this movie just about blows the rest out the water it s certainly a great deal better than the over hyped sense and sensibility 1995 and pride and prejudice 1996 everything about this movie is a thumb up i do n t understand why people have problems with the cast the story or the music the leads are definitely not the regular hollywood types but that only makes them that much more believable i think this production is the finest showing of ensemble acting i ve seen the script is a rather faithful rendering of austen s novel e g 90 of the dialogue comes straight from the book and so i do n t understand why some people say that they like persuasion the novel but find problems with this part or that part of the story of the movie and the music is by the romantic period composer chopin enough said nthis is not a movie to watch just once in this regard it s like a book i watched it several times before i was able to pick up on how effectively the relationship between anne and frederick is juxtaposed against the various other relationships in the movie ni read the novel subsequent to watching the movie and i found no jarring differences in the stories of the two mediums with the exception of mr elliot and mrs smith the book presents mr elliot far more critical light and i think austen s alternate ending was very well integrated into the movie the brains behind the movie really did their homework in selecting the cast and condensing the novel to a script that still retains much of the nuances of the novel
8;3;109;0.8377853688398372;my copy of the novel persuasion refers to it as having an autumnal tone which has definitely carried over into this adaptation it makes no pretensions to being another pride and prejudice or sense and sensibility lacking those books underlying theme of warm friendship between sisters nor is it like emma or northanger abbey both comedies featuring immature women and their self discovery in other words persuasion may be a disappointment to those who passionately love one of those other stories and expect the same thing this is ironic considering that some believe persuasion was based on an incident in jane austen s real life where she apparently turned away a suitor in her youth and later regretted it nagain the autumnal tone is picked up by the two leads who are older and less conventionally attractive than say kate beckingsdale or jeremy northam ciaran hinds has a quiet charisma that grows the longer you watch him and has developed into a viable leading man amanda root begins the film as a grey little mouse and transforms into a more lovely woman halfway through solely through her skill as an actress and not through a film of vasoline smeared on the camera nthose who complain that root is not pretty enough to fit their mental image are missing the point and probably did not read the book where austen points out that anne s beauty had faded with age as we read on we realize that it s her love for life that s dimmed which in turn has affected her attractiveness to others her handsome father certainly becomes less good looking each time his prissy behavior is described nin the film it would be easy to pull a grease like transformation where like olivia newton john amanda root comes out all dolled up in makeup and a hot bodice ready to jump on the regency tilt a whirl but the captain and anne regain their passion for another through their rediscovery of each other s hearts not their good looks although seeing each other s good character instantly brightens their countenance and puts a spring in their step making them much more attractive neither hinds nor root need a gallon of makeup to make this transformation believable nthe two performances that i enjoyed most however were that of sophie thompson and fiona shaw thompson who was only vaguely boorish in four weddings and a funeral as a woman despairing of meeting a quality mate goes full hog as a high maintenance mooch very funny nshaw on the other hand is one of the funniest things about the harry potter movies as harry s dreadful aunt here she is positively vibrant as a happy naval wife she just brims with love and vigor believable as a woman who has travelled the seas to be with her husband and who wishes happiness for her younger brother and all around her both the character and the portrayal make a fine contrast to anne s waspish sisters and father and the overindulgent yet loving musgroves only five years older than costar root with what seems to be a great range i wonder what charm shaw might have brought to the role of anne if she had been offered the part at an appropriate age nthis is a warm and yes subtle movie which will chase away the blues on a winter day
9;15;20;0.8351206818574527;it s been a little while since i first and last watched this version of persuasion but i remember very well how much i disliked it i promised myself as soon as it ended that i would never watch it again n npersuasion is a late novel one of austen s most autobiographical it s a story written by and about a woman who d lost love and reconciled herself to never finding it again nowhere in this adaptation does that idea come about and if you ve honestly never read the book i m astonished you even know what s going on throughout the film n nand still more one of the greatest things about austen s novels is that they still have the power even now to make a reader feel exactly what the character feels unfortunately this adaptation of the novel has none of that power even knowing how anne feels in any particular scene from reading the novel a dozen times i still could n t see any sort of emotion from amanda root every emotion seemed to be exactly the same but that said root by no means displayed the worst acting in the film that dishonor goes to ciaran hinds who ca n t play a romantic character to save his life his acting is based on extremes there s either too much emotion or too little he displays an intensity that s just a little bit too uncomfortable and for the two romantic roles i ve seen him in wentworth in this and rochester in the 97 jane eyre he introduces a violent and quite frankly frightening side to his characters that s fine for a staged adaptation or something but not for a film it s a liberty that can completely ruin a character austen s heroines love their heroes not because they represent forbidden pleasures and masochism but because they re men usually just plain and simple men n nand even worse than the poor acting are the horrible age discrepancies between actors and characters it s one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to film adaptations of beloved austen novels the majority of austen s heroines are in their early twenties some are still in their teens but it seems that when these characters are cast for a film their ages are completely ignored in the case of this anne elliot root fits the part to begin with but when anne regains her bloom in the novel nothing ever happens to root who still looks a little old and haggard and hinds was 42 when he played the part of wentworth a character who is in his early to mid thirties and he looked every day of his age i can understand casting for talent more than age especially with a beloved classic such as persuasion but there s no talent here they could have hunted down a couple of university students who would have looked their part better and acted much better than the two leads n nfor someone who has read the novel or even someone who has n t i would suggest staying away from this verison of persuasion honestly if you want to watch a version of persuasion turn to the 07 version it s not entirely true to the book but the majority of the liberties they took with the story are acceptable and the acting is immensely better an adaptation with a few good liberties taken can turn out to be better than an adaptation that claimsm to be entirely true to the novel
10;126;96;0.8159385762920933;equally the most underated and this seems to be because the characterisitions are so perfectly spot on this is afterall the story of a couple who missed their chance at happiness because of being persuaded by the strength of social values and snobbery so apparant and influencial in this period of history n n they move on to be persuaded by the inaccuracy of opinion proved over time and persuaded by a slow growing sense of reignited love and passion being 19th century people the simmer slowly over events that would overwhelm and excite modern day folk and the characters are polite and understated n n root and hinds are pivotal in driving this drama with accuracy and excellence but the nature of their simmering stoicism has perhaps made this an overlooked drama it is beautiful in it s comments on the coming good of the human conditon and the historical placement and projection is stunning be persuaded to give this a whirl and see in a sublimely accurate way the strongest of social comments austen made on the values of her own time

12;71;70;0.7864354306522563;persuasion may not have the wit of pride prejudice the morality of mansfield park or sense sensibility or the delightful twists and turns of emma and northanger abby but it is probably jane austen s most mature and achingly romantic story by the same token this film version of persuasion while perhaps lacking the glamourous faces and costumes that adorn the flock of austen films produced in the mid 1990 s is far and away the most faithfully adapted movie of the lot nick dear s script is beautifully spare relying on the subtly expressive faces and gestures of a cast that is absolute perfection filmed completely on location and using only natural light every scene seems to have been painted directly from miss austen s imagination

14;96;19;0.7608811341871985;i found this movie to be so disjointed very hard to truly understand what the main characters anne and wentworth were really thinking some scenes just did not make sense almost as if some part of the story was missing i can count the number of scenes with anne and wentworth together and worst still in the few scenes where they did appear together they barely spoke to each other until the tail end of the movie if we the audience were to gain some inkling of their feelings from their body language during these scarce occasions then that too was sorely lacking i have not read the book yet but i am a great fan of the author this adaptation left me with a bad taste and no longer wanting to read the book if it were not for the several reviews i ve read about what the book is supposed to be about and the praise in such reviews i d have just resigned to being perhaps the only jane austen fan who never read persuasion i do n t think this adaptation truly conveyed the essence of the story and indeed i was very disappointed with this particular adaptation
15;130;34;0.7575726083013061;as i watched the 2008 masterpiece version of persuasion i was appalled at the blithe rewriting of the story inadequate acting and interminable unnecessary pauses that doubled the run time i love the novel and the story came alive for me as i watched this movie perfection in every scene the actors fit their characters so exquisitely that i could not imagine anyone else playing the roles and certainly there are none that could come close to amanda root and ciaran hand playing the leads their respective transformations from rundown to radiant and aloof to passionate were subtle and spot on and completely matched my personification of the characters as i read the book i watch the final scenes every time i need a romantic high wentworth realizing anne still loves him has he hears her say that women love the longest when there is no hope and anne reading his amazing letter that brings her total joy then madly trying to be alone with him to say yes well done
16;20;17;0.7101015688756327;i love jane austen i love period movies ciaran hinds and fiona shaw are great actors but none of this can save the wooden performances and terrible directing in this movie the cast has no chemistry the lines are delivered with all the life of a plank the constant sloppy eating is hard to watch as are all the cast with the cinematographer showing them in the most unattractive way possible the score is entirely forgettable 104 minutes of my life i will never get back
17;5;5;0.6306527877369786;the reviewers who said his is the best austen adaption are spot on with their analysis i sat agape in the dark theater and was so drawn in that when the lights came up i completely forgot i had come to the theater with a friend this movie and story blew me away seriously i sat with my jaw open the whole of the movie no popcorn candy or ladies room break i was transported every character was so well acted and when captain wentworth came to check on the boy and anne saw fredrick for the first time in 8 years i m holding my breath just thinking of how she felt the scene where the musgroves are all complaining to anne about each other was so real and hilarious i ve watched and read all other movie versions of austen novels probably 8 000 times each but this is my favorite movie adaptation

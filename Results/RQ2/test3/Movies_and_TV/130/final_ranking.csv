0;107;20;0.8824968942270354;the aristocrats is a hilarious wildly irreverent documentary centering on a host of mostly famous and infamous comedians telling their own versions of the oldest most repugnant vaudeville joke in the world this joke always has the same opening a guy with a new act goes to a talent agent s office and the punchline is always the aristocrats with that punchline being conveyed almost every time with a ta daa flair the punchline itself is n t important it s the journey leading up to it now what happens in between the set up and the punchline is entirely at the discretion of the narrator the middle portion is what makes the joke so mind bogglingly risque as the comics riff and vie to drop in the most outrageous of details ranging from graphically sexual in nature to scatological to gruesomely even disturbingly violent to adding elements of bestiality to just plain outre there s a free wheeling jazzy feel inherent in the film as the joke tellers seem to yank stuff from the stream of consciousness in their various impromptu depictions of the joke so when is a film too offensive i m not sure sometimes i m not sure that the omnipresent bad taste in this film is n t actually superceded by a form of overriding artistry n nwhen i was in the movie theatre watching the aristocrats i noticed two things one there were people who gasped and then stormed out in disgust two there were people who gasped and then stayed but not necessarily in their seats some were standing or rolling around in laughter i stayed my outraged older co worker stalked out and probably took a cab home i was his ride i got ta admit i thought i knew what i was in for but i was unprepared for the rancid verbal assault that spewed on me from the screen to say this film is irreverent is to probably understate things this has got to be bar none the filthiest film i have ever heard i was in shock yet i could n t stop laughing n nlike someone already mentioned as the film progresses the constant onslaught and repetition of the joke begin to prey on one s mind leaving one numb and inured fortunately there are enough funnymen who cover the joke in hilarious and inimitably personal fashion to ease the sensory overload and to break the monotony threatening to wash over the audience n nthe ones who made me laugh most were otto george the guy with the profane puppet wendy liebman and her wholesome rendition martin mull with his non sequitur version kevin pollak telling it as christopher walken jon ross he of the flexed rubber grin eric mead the card dealing comic billy the mime bob saget with his gut busting delivery just prior to going on stage i knew saget was depraved but holy crap and yes his was my favorite the animated kids from south park and the sexy and irreverent sarah silverman noteworthy is gilbert gottfried s version which he busted out during the friar s roast of hugh hefner when his 9 11 joke tanked thus far gottfried s version is lauded as the best retelling of the joke n ni m giving the aristocrats 4 and a half stars because of its daring its unapologetic political incorrectness and its vulgar but undeniably frequent laugh out loud hilarity it s worth the price of admission just to witness old school and currently it comics getting shockingly dirty and earthy i ca n t give it five stars because not all the comics were amusing some like stephen wright david brenner hank azaria howie mandel and carrie fisher even went as far as to leave me cold blank faced and even bored other plodding moments have to do with several talking heads waxing philosophical about the nature of or being long winded with their analysis of the joke n nbut i heartily recommend the aristocrats which ultimately is about the pure catharsis and saving grace of humor but buyer beware only those with strong intestinal fortitude should take a peek at this documentary
1;46;17;0.8641274294760765;how is it possible for a group of filmmakers to gather together more than a hundred of the world s foremost comedians into a single documentary and yet elicit not one genuine laugh in the entire film well i m not sure quite how they ve accomplished it but the aristocrats for all its high priced comic talent is one seriously unfunny movie n nthe film is built around a supposedly classic joke involving an agent who walks into a producer s office declares have i got an act for you and then proceeds to describe that act in terms so lurid that even a convention of satan worshipping sailors might have trouble booking it for one of their programs when the agent finally finishes his description the producer asks what s the act called a query which is always followed by the response the aristocrats the object of the joke is for the teller to be as offensive disgusting and perverted as possible in the lead up to the punch line routinely the subject matter involves incest bestiality pedophilia violence urination defecation and a whole host of other topics not normally broached in polite society in what amounts to a talking heads documentary the aristocrats basically consists of all these great comics running their own variations on this one joke while discussing the iconoclastic function of humor and providing an occasional backstage glimpse into the art of joke telling i guess that s where the redeeming social value aspect comes in n nthe main problem with the movie is not that it is crude vulgar and disgusting per se but that it is crude vulgar and disgusting without being funny in fact after the umpteenth take on the same routine we sink into a kind of humor deprived stupor that lasts for almost a full ninety minutes n nhonestly i appreciate a dirty joke as much as the next fellow but the aristocrats is all dirty and no joke
2;108;21;0.8611972696337825;nothing is further from the truth than the subtitle ending the film keep the joke alive all you have to remember is one word i ve never cared much for heavily front loaded epic length jokes both because i fear that i wo n t get the punchline when if it comes and because i m envious of talented tellers aware that at best i m good for no more than a one liner at one point the joke that s the object of the film is compared to a john coltrane solo right on most of the performers in this film are improvisers supreme playing on a riff going where angels fear to tread n nthe stand outs are carlin he s always good but i previously never realized how spontaneously good he can be saget he shows his dedication to and sheer love of the art by going on in spite of himself and the show stopper gilbert gottfried by all means do n t give up on the film until gottfried s climactic performance like the joke itself the film justifies itself at that moment as told by gottfried the joke is every bit as filthy perverse and obscene but it s no longer offensive at that moment we are not merely a peverse dysfunctional family but a human community united by the capacity for thinking the worst otherwise the possibility of being offended by this movie would n t exist but also for daring to make the best out of the worst we re god s fallen angels still redeemable because we re not too proud to acknowledge the body fluids that make up at least part of the spirit incarnate rising from the muck we are true aristrocrats in the almighty s eyes and if there s a more powerful example of grace i ca n t imagine what it could be n ncredit must be given to fred willard for observing that words like the sophisticates or the royalty would ruin the joke the family act that calls themselves the aristocrats does so in a spirit of unknowing humility and hope they re not trying to be merely funny n nalso take note of the performer who near the end observes that the joke may soon be out of favor because all of these once unmentionable obscenities are now everyday stuff forget the humor real aristocrat acts can be downloaded from all over the internet which leaves ethnicity race and gender i e the politically incorrect as the last off limits frontier it s enough to make you long for the good old days when people were sufficiently civilized to be able to appreciate humor as subtle as the aristocrats
3;45;14;0.8492646378290725;this movie is not offensive at least not in the way the producers want it to be most of us have an anything goes attitude towards entertainment these days and accordingly broadcasting something as offensive has just become a tired combination of marketing device and transparent attempt to appear a first amendment champion continued use of profanity and bathroom humor is n t all that funny if you re older than 13 it s initially kind of amusing then puerile then pathetic comics tend to be attention starved anyway and therefore take any joke further and longer than you or i would care to see case in point the aristocrats n nthat aside i wanted to like this movie i loved the premise that telling a joke is like jazz in that plenty of artists repeat the same material but with their own interpretation it s the singer comedian that resonates not the song joke however this film is a one trick pony that long outlives its clever foundation i also had a hard time believing that these guys found the joke all that funny themselves most of the onscreen laughs were due to the chemistry between these old friends and the audience is n t really a part of the joke a lot of the time n nthe film s novelties provide the most entertaining moments kevin pollack s christopher walken imitation billy the mime taylor negron s gay rendition and a magician who tells the joke via a card trick george carlin was really the only comic who made me laugh with his version of a strict telling of the joke on top of everything else i found the jarring mtv style editing and quick camera switches made the aristocrats even tougher to watch n nwhile we re on the subject is there anyone worse than bob saget he can swear as much as he wants and he s still every bit as annoying and unfunny as when he hosted america s funniest videos impossibly he s even less funny when profane
4;61;45;0.8243042127637259;my advice is rent this movie before you buy it you will either love it or hate it if you re won over the extra 5 will be inconsequential n nfirst of all do n t listen to the reviews that say if you did n t like it you did n t get it cutting down opinions that differ from yours is just plain unfair n ni realize that beyond being a supposedly hilarious movie the premise is the art of the joke and possibly how it fits in with freedom of speech political correctness in today s world i went in not expecting the joke to be funny but the delivery to be which was n t the case at all it s an hour and a half of being on the outside of an in joke and as for any intended higher meaning it was completely lost on me n ni was so excited about seeing this movie that i convinced 6 other people whom i laugh together with on a daily basis to watch it with me when i received my dvd believe me the humor my friends and i share is in no way prude but when we watched this movie all you could hear were crickets to be fair mario cantone s delivery was great as was doug stanhope telling the joke to his unwitting toddler but both of those combined made up at best 2 minutes of the entire movie n ni honestly wish i could see in this movie what all the people who rave about it do and how they get away with putting those 2 reviews on the dvd cover is beyond me
5;49;46;0.7705378412926422;i am staring this reviewing by saying i did not fast forward or stop this film at any time since i rented it if i went to see it in a movie theater i would not have walked out at any time i write this review having watched the entire film though i can certainly understand why so many people actually did walk out of the theater when the aristocrats premiered and out of curiosity i wanted to watch this film and having watched it all the way through i am sorry that i did nif it were actually funny i would be able to appreciate it admire it give it credit and most importantly laugh at it the problem as all problems with jokes is if it s not funny it s just plain pathetic yet sometimes pathetic can even be funny but not this time it was way over the top and i know i know that s the whole point that these comedians go so far over the top with this joke it is a game of who s sicker than who but as the comedians would say it who s more creative and outrageous than who how about a game of who s funnier than who and the winner is nobody ndirty jokes can be extremely funny drew carey s 101 big richard jokes in the book dirty jokes and beer but this goes beyond dirty and enters into too sick and overly disgusting territory as by the way it promises to enter and does and that just does not cut it for me in the humor department it works in the sad and pathetic department though i ll give you an example of what other gross out humor i have found to be funny to an extent scary movie and somewhat scary movie 2 there s something about mary national lampoon s animal house everything you ve always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask and my favorite stand up concert is eddie murphy s delirious so i am not offended by sexual humor in general it just all depends on what s funny and what s not funny one of the most unfunny tellings would be from who most people viewed as the best sarah silverman funny hmm well if i were hard of hearing and unable to read lips maybe i could imagine her saying something that would make me laugh but unfortunately in this case i do have my hearing and i did not even chuckle or so much as smile nthe comedians i believe could have made this joke funny are sam kinison buddy hackett rodney dangerfield and possibly my all time favorite comedian richard pryor and would n t you know it all four are no longer alive but then again the almost always funny george carlin is alive was in this film and was not funny at all with this material so go figure actually george carlin has said many times before that anything can be funny it all depends on how you construct the joke i believe that to be true but nobody at all in this film constructed this joke in a way that came across as remotely funny to me
6;103;9;0.7583080186730771;i saw this film when it was in theatres and up until that time it was the only movie that s ever made me feel guilty for laughing i mean some of the jokes are so horrific i felt so utterly disgusting for even allowing myself to laugh there just is n t enough forgiveness in heaven for what i ve heard literally people were squirming in their seats at the hundreds of awkward moments if there s any topic or sexual act considered taboo prepare to have it raunchily discussed in agonizing details because well that s the objective of the joke i ve heard some pretty nasty things in my time and do n t get shocked too often but this is comedic naughtiness taken to serious extremes if you can find it in you to watch this there are believe it or not really good reasons to watch this film n first seeing movies nowadays at least for me is kind of a bore the same ole stock characters love triangles talking dogs jerry bruckheimer go boom saving the world usa rules type films are getting so hatefully boring this movie is a welcome relief after seeing it i think you ll agree it s exciting because it s premise is incredibly original n secondly there s over 100 of todays best comedians participating in this dirty improv marathon what s great is that you get to see each comic take a spin on this underground joke but still keep their comedic essence some of the best to watch out for are sarah silverman bob saget gilbert gottfried and one of my favorites kevin pollak n lastly not only will certain visuals have you rolling but it s very interesting to see comics use some of our most terrible recent tragedies and dare to include them in their jokes i mean have you ever thought 9 11 could be funny superficially it s mostly for pure shock value it s supposed to be but there are certain points in the film where it s also therapeutic n this film is amazing to not only track down over 100 comics and expertly pick the choiciest parts of their rendition of this heinous joke but just the editing alone must ve been a monumental feat it could ve been a comic itself it had impeccable timing n my mind is beyond repair but it was worth it
7;57;12;0.7530694789851478;my husband and i watched the aristocrats he with a faint smile me howling that is until billy the mime came on when he began laughing uproariously and i almost passed out from hysterics n nup to that point i was laughing away at pretty much everyone while he shook his head and announced that this was white humor n n it s not white humor i replied it s jewish humor or even more precisely jewish show biz humor which means once we return to basics that the aristocrats is the most american of american humor n n the aristocrats is not for everyone but if it s right for you it s a howler from beginning to end as are the out takes and even the voice over extras some have noted that the aristocrats is not for those who dislike foul language let me be more precise i dislike foul language for its own sake employed simply to be coarse and vulgar i find foul language should be reserved for a when a hammer hits your finger b when comedians at the top of their game know exactly when to use vulgarity without a single wasted gratuitous def comedy jam f bomb dropped n nwhat is amazing about the aristocrats is how perfect the comedians pitch is in their retelling of the vulgar joke this is a lot of miles davis virtuosity and very little kenny g n nin addition to billy the mime my other favorites were sarah silverman and the guys who tell the aristocrats joke as christopher walken kevin pollack and liza minelli mario cantone n ntaylor negron was mesmerizing and daring n nkudos to the ventriloquist the fire jugglers the card trick guy and matt and trey of south park for finding non linear new ways to present the joke n ngod bless tom and dick smothers carrie fisher and drew carey for being quietly flawless with the joke and good sports about not taking their clean images too seriously n nthat the aristocrats is at times poorly shot only adds to its charm and authenticity the editing is at times inspired in the interweaving of the performances and at times less so n none quibble the editors could have killed the interviews with eddie izzard bily connolly and eric idle maybe even chris rock and taken merrill markoe s entire joke unedited off the dvd extras and into the main dvd that s if they dared
8;104;10;0.7046062580502822;see it if you have n t already ideally with a group of people i do n t know what s buggin all these one star review people but i saw it in a packed movie house and everybody laughed until it hurt the whole time is the joke itself all that funny no but hear this friends the movie was not about the joke similar to a jazz performance throughout history great and memorable solos and improvisations have been rendered from some fairly ordinary material but oh if you happened to be in the club that one night
9;105;11;0.685075379464791;not only is this rip off a poor production values documentary it is fatally spoiled by the violent child sex molesting imagery conjured up by some of the participants n ni strongly urge you to avoid this like the plague it is nauseating i found it offensive and inane beyond belief i rarely advocate censorship but this was the kind of thing that would make a useful presentation aid for persuading people of the irrevocable decadence of the us entertainment industry and i guess by proxy western culture n nfreedom of speech breaking down taboos post political correctness nothing n nsexual molestation of children is inexcusable unforgivable and not something to joke about
10;33;7;0.5025454821489653;the subject of this documentary film is one joke with the punch line the aristocrats this joke is a legendary old joke that allows comedians to improvise almost endlessly on the set up in which the goal is to compete to see who can invent the most disgusting filthy sick twisted scatalogical gross perverse nauseating evil and bizarre tale imaginable it s been a sort of professional challenge among comedians to see who can go the farthest and break the most taboos and you ll see a lot of outstanding efforts that more than achieve that goal n nif you can deal with that then this might be the funniest dvd you ll ever own stellar comedians such as robin williams penn teller michael palin and drew carey a host of great newer comics and even older ones like david brenner and galleger and many more are featured and the editing is brilliant one surprise is that perhaps the most twisted and filthy and hilarious versions of the aristocrats presented in the entire film is by mr clean himnself bob sagat n nand on top of being side splittingly funny the film is a very interesting insight into how comedians disect and analyse a joke what makes a joke work or flop and other inside glimpse into the art of comedy n njust a great film

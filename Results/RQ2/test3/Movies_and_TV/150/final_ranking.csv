0;90;61;0.8235154281202939;i m not even 30 but have had stress incontinence since a young age i had heard you pee your pants when jumping after bearing children so why was that happening to me at age 16 i always heard do your kegels but never felt i understood how like how often and in what position and how many i did n t feel i knew if i was doing them correctly or even remembered to do them 12 years and 2 kids later i m having a lot of pelvic pain and ca n t even use tampons because they just do n t fit right anymore ni have researched a bit into vaginal weights but always get overwhelmed and then stop shopping one day when talking to a friend i finally decided i had to buckle down and order something i about cried when someone said in a review for weights that they did n t work with a prolapse it describes the symptoms i had with tampons and said a doctor may not mention a minor prolapse i had thought things just were n t quite right in there but what to do now i kept seeing this stupid dvd for sale and thought no i need equipment when i finally read reviews i felt hopeful and knew i needed to try it ni ve not been perfect about using it but have been pretty decent and even if i have n t made it through an entire workout once in bed i actually remember to do kegels and feel like i can actually do them i apparently needed to be walked through it the way this lady does it and the visuals really help yes it gets annoying to listen to but i just listen to something else and watch for cues ni feel that things are changing and i have n t had the pelvic pain i m hopeful that things will continue to improve as i continue with the program yes it just may be worth your money to buy a stupid dvd think if it as physical therapy because it is for someone with less problems than i have other options may be best but if you have very little pelvic floor strength this is a great place to start
1;39;92;0.8216875856853377;the instructions and descriptions of the exercises are very clear and informative i just could not stand the thought of having surgery to correct my prolapse and decided to give some serious exercise a try first i have used the program for about 2 months and have noticed a great improvement i could tell i was making progress with in the first 2 3 weeks when i saw my obgyn a few weeks ago my prolapse was down graded to a stage one i will continue to use these exercises and i would n t hesitate to recommend this video to anyone looking to rehab their pelvic floor it was definitely worth it for myself
2;80;80;0.8125775822746368;i have used this now for a few months and have found it helpful i already knew that i was having problems with a nervous bladder but when i experienced a prolapse i was frightened after doing some research i found that prior to any surgery or other medical things a round of physical therapy would be ordered i decided i d rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home tasha mulligan is a pt and specialized in this area the anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization this was important and helpful to me also helpful is the quiet matter of fact voice the pace of the workouts and her counting i ca n t count concentrate and exercise at the same time i need someone else counting it took a full month of using this on the first set of workouts before i could slightly feel the muscles move it was in the second month that i began noticing the improvement of bladder issues with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles the third month the prolapse was not bothering me i have followed up with my obgyn who let me know i was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up i m still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts i am well pleased with the results and grateful that tasha mulligan put it out

4;5;42;0.7732994595613243;this was a lifesaver for me after the birth of my second child i felt great and was very excited to get back to running after about 4 weeks because i had stayed fit run throughout pregnancy and was itching to get back into my old routine i went for a short run and felt something shift i ended up with a uterine prolapse 2nd 3rd degree upon searching the internet and talking to my ob i was completely devastated i was a d1 college track and cross country athlete and running is a defining part of my life i was told from all angles that i was never going to run again and the only resolution was going to be surgery after being done having kids i went through a couple of months very depressed mean and just overall miserable after a fellow mom mentioned this dvd i decided to give it a try after a month of doing the dvd every other day i added in some weight training and really focused on building my core hip flexor and and lower back muscles in late january i started to run again starting with a qtr of a mile at a time and raised the distance by a qtr of a mile each week i just ran a half marathon a week ago at 8 months postpartum and am back to running like my old self i highly encourage anybody dealing with prolapse or any other pelvic floor issues to try this dvd before agreeing to any surgery mine is completely gone and for that i am so grateful
5;53;118;0.7409774333314642;i developed prolapse after moving lots of boxes three months right after my son s natural birth the feeling of my bottom is falling down stopped me from living a normal life i thought i will have to live with it forever and was very depressed then i did a lot of reading researching about remedies and also went to a few physical therapist sessions i would say that this is the most helpful exercise among all from other reviewers comments it seems that i will have to constantly follow this exercise otherwise the prolapse comes back i very much prefer doing this to the feeling of prolapse
6;73;38;0.7394508849764292;fred s wife here so 4 weeks after having a beautiful 8 5lb baby boy it was very apparent that i had a prolapsed bladder i had 2 weeks to go before my first postnatal dr s appointment but i did n t need him to tell me what was already obvious so i started to do some research and came across the hab it dvd ladies it is well worth the 20 or 30 i started doing the hab it video at 5 weeks postpartum 5x per week and within 3 weeks i could tell it was already improving i could n t get a pelvic floor physical therapy appointment which my ob gyn prescribed until 2 months after my 6 week appointment and i m so happy i had this dvd it goes beyond just kegel exercises and will help your core in general get stronger my baby is 5 months old now and my bladder prolapse is still there but soooo much better i m pretty confident by the time he s a year old i will rarely think about it if you any sort of pelvic floor issues do n t ignore them you must work to make them get better this dvd is absolutely great i now do it only 2 3 x per week
7;17;128;0.7309192012361309;after a rough delivery at about 3 weeks i diagnosed my own rectocele i had a natural delivery and felt betrayed that my body was so traumatized and found the symptoms very uncomfortable in a fit of despair i ordered this dvd and was elated to find that after 2 weeks of regular use my body started to feel normal again incidentally i slacked for a week thinking i was fixed and my prolapse symptoms started to return these exercises work and also provide some gentle toning postpartum prolapse is something women should talk about more and prepare each other for the possibility postpartum i highly recommend
8;50;13;0.688761747774192;i was devastated when i experienced a bladder prolapse after the birth of my baby my midwife recommended a costly physical therapist to correct the issues and when one appointment cost me 200 i decided to give this a try first i stuck with exercise 1 and despite my best efforts only squeezed in the workouts about every three days however it still worked after a few weeks my symptoms had almost entirely disappeared and i was back to my favorite exercise of walking hills now with a much more informed and capable basket i enjoy the exercises so much they simply feel good i m continuing on now in my second month of doing them and look forward to further results highly recommended
9;45;8;0.6489378341530551;this is an amazing pt workout after being diagnosed with slight prolapse after the birth of my first child i started to do these workouts she explains each exercise thoroughly after a few weeks my prolapse felt almost gone then i got the stomach flu so did n t do these exercises for a week and the prolapse got noticeably worse again anyways i am now back to doing these exercises again i am sold on these and would recommend them to anyone postpartum even somebody who does n t have a diagnosed prolapse an extra bonus is that my husband absolutely loves how i hold myself using the posture this video not only explains but also strengthens the right muscles to enable you to hold during the day i have also tried a couple workout videos from whole woman and met with a ww representative but in my opinion the workouts on this pt video are far superior this really is a good buy to have several pt workouts for less than the price of one pt appointment
10;40;23;0.6333229438995971;i ve been doing the workout for about a month and i m already noticing results and i m only on workout one the education given on anatomy and how you need more than just kegels to strengthen your pelvic floor and get improved continence is really helpful i m very happy with the program

13;46;10;0.48104431729205066;the material was probably good but the dvd could not be maneuvered from segment to segment in other words you could watch it all the way through but if you wanted to focus on one of the segments and skip another that could not be done i had others try the dvd on other dvd players with he same outcome unfortunately because of that i returned the dvd

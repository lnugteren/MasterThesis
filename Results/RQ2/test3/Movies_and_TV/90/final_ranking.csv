0;18;80;0.8784963006943419;the grand opus of monty python a goofy gang of guys who invented the most skewed comedy routines in the world rather than a series of individual spoofs this movie is a long spoof based on arthurian legend specifically the legend of the holy grail somehow these six guys not only produced a low budget movie but cast themselves in multiple many multiple roles throughout it and still maintained a hilarious result nrather than a real story this is a series of vignettes concerning the long suffering king arthur and his loyal knights of the round table we eat ham and jam and spam a lot among them are n the encounter with the communist peasants in their autonamous collective help help i m being repressed n the tale of sir robin the cowardly knight with a chicken on his shield n the king s encounter with the loony black knight in which a ridiculous series of blood spurtings will have you guffawing you ve got no arms left yes i have look it s just a flesh wound n sir lancelot receives a desperate note from a castle but is the person sending it what he expects n the french attack verbally your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries n sir galahad is waylaid in the temptation laden castle of the maidens interestingly enough in traditional legends sir galahad did go to the castle of the maidens though in very different circumstances leer n the keepers of the sacred word the knights who say ni n the rabbit of death tim the enchanter and so much more nthe sheer off the wallness is what sells this movie and monty python was in rare form graham chapman s primary role is king arthur who seems to be the most competant of the bunch but is still pretty goofy john cleese of fish and fawlty towers fame stars as sir lancelot tim the wizard the rude frenchman and is amazing in each role eric idle plays lily livered sir robin roger the shrubber do n t ask brother maynard terry gilliam is lower key as sir gawain patsy terry jones is also pretty low key as sir bedivere prince herbert michael palin has a hilarious series of roles including the king os swamp castle sir galahad leader of the knights who say ni nshoring up the cast is cleese s now ex wife connie booth as the witch john young as the historian dead body neil innes as the annoying minstrel page killed by rabbit nperhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations with the coconut shells and so forth the special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded the script is typically hilarious full of stupid comments and straight faced jokes nfrankly it s hard to think of camelot now without rhyming it with i have to push the pram a lot and the line of tap dancing knights this movie is lodged in the american brain and it ai n t budging soon na small note you may want to check out the veggie tales ep josh and the big wall in which a respectful yet kooky homage is paid to this film
1;63;45;0.8768859802750991;if you know and love this movie you should get this collector s edition asap the extras are fabulous and the special high definition presentation with pink frilly edges looks just as gloriously bad as it does on any other dvd released so far for a movie set in middles ages and shot in the 1970s it s better than what you might expect the packaging is really shoddy with a famous glue strip that tried to break the extras dvd when i attempted to remove it from the box once i accomplished the extraction i struggled for a long while trying to figure out how to place the second dvd back in the cumbersome box of not quite so sturdy construction which basically fell apart after opening however is it not in the spirit of monty python to have this opus magnum housed in a box whose condition mimics this of the cheap collapsing camelot model in the film i placed the second dvd in an empty plastic box and proceeded to discover the wonders of this deranged collection which is great beyond words nfor starters there is the senitype a single 33 milimeter frame from the original motion picture negative which comes framed in a cardboard file describing how to start collecting the yearly editions of the frame and warns you that while it is not a laxative well you need to get the box to find out the rest nthe print edition of the script the singalongs the documentaries the subtitles for people who do n t like the film the japanese version of the movie and the lego block version of the camelot scene my favourite it will take you a couple of hours at least to go through the whole magnificent lot nthis is one collector s edition which lives up to its title and it does it to the optional soundtrack in glorious old fashion mono and animated menus with very loud surround sound highly recommended
2;27;41;0.8741101686908285;i had my first exposure to monty python as a very young child when their shows were first being broadcast in the us in the mid 70s and my folks would watch them then i saw this movie on cinemax around 1982 and again the following day by the way spiny normal gives it two prickly thumbs up dinsdale after which i promptly went out and bought dramatic pause a shrubbery dramatic music i laughed i cried i wet my pants well all right not really i did a few silly walks n nthe genius of the pythons simply can not be overstated holy grail was made on a shoestring budget yet the lads managed to wring the maximum amount of laughs and silliness out of the arthurian legends to great effect on that budget from the use of coconuts to imitate the sound of hoofbeats to the burning of a witch because she s made of wood and floats on water like a duck cor she turned me into a newt a newt long pause i got better to castle anthrax and lots of good spankings to the bridge of death what is your favourite colour blue very well then off you go there s nary a wrong step here the bonus materials are a bit of fun too i must add that the subtitles make the lines easier to understand as well they make it much easier for you and your friends to spend countless hours quoting the film back and forth at each other and the lines are very quotable n nand the general quality of the film in the special edition is greatly improved the prior dvd release had muddy sound and murky images and while the film was enjoyable nevertheless you still felt a little cheated after all the dvd is supposed to be an improvement over the old vhs with the special edition it is clearer and brighter both in sound and images sony pictures has finally given this classic film a new lease on life and the extra 24 seconds of footage are good for a chuckle or two

4;56;25;0.8492605483457271;king arthur and his knights of the round table set out on a quest to find the holy grail as told to do so by a cartoon god that lives in the clouds n neasily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made monty python and the holy grail claims it s undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated pure comedic genius that does n t go stale with age or decades of competition having been released simply seeing the way comedy films are made today this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it an absolute belly laugh fest that never lets up n nonly the cast of monty python could have pulled this film off with each actor playing many different characters all hilarious the genius in the actors lines themselves are truly to be admired the comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do simply because they ca n t compete with the genius of this film which uses it flawlessly those that do try usually fall flat on their faces two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts and the other when lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the damsel in distress this is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film the only way that i can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it s type of humor too bad for them n nanother hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background from people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields all very strange and hilarious at the same time it s also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors which shows the great range all of them have some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out which makes it fun and i do n t want to ruin it for anyone but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming n nridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter n nthe epitome of all star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time kudos to gilliam and the rest of the python crew if you have n t seen it yet make it your first priority in life
5;62;44;0.8482808709272797;terry jones the co director of monty python and the holy grail once said that comedy is defined as two disparate forces coming together and colliding that definition may not fit into all varieties of comedy but for the monty python crew and especially this movie it does almost all the scenes in this movie are true masterpieces of this definition of comedy whether it is a medieval serf spouting off neo marxist thought or the ancient enchanter named tim this film also contains the greatest deus ex machina ending in the history of cinema with police interrupting arthur s last glorious charge on a personal note the first time i saw this movie at about the age of 15 on pbs i did not know what to think when the film ended with the camera being confiscated by the authorities i said to my father what happened my dad responded i guess they ran out of film you know pbs so for those of you who have not seen the movie try to savor your reaction the first time you see a cow flying over a castle wall or the attack on castle aaaaaaargh the dvd special features are well worth it too with an insightful director s commentary and a trip with jones and palin touring the sites where the movie was filmed
6;60;37;0.8455058044136505;surprisingly i first watch monty python and the holy grail while i was in high school now when i say i was in high school i mean i was actually sitting in english lit class as a learning experience not surprisingly this class was taught by the same teacher who gave away beer mugs which he tried to convince everyone were milk mugs needless to say this was the greatest class i had in my educational career n nbut the great thing about monty python i that it actually works on an educational level with high brow comedy that the uneducated may not get there were plenty of references that dealt with obscure british history may not get so while watching it in class we would watch a scene and laugh at it s sophomoric humor then the teacher would rewind it and point out the little things that us the uneducated would n t get then have a laugh at the deeper meaning n nyet it is still the silliness that draws people to the monty python franchise and there is plenty of that in the holy gail in addition to the french dude that uttered the title phrase some of my personal favorite parts are the black knight who would n t die the holy hand grenade and the knights who say ni and as part of the english lit class we learned the ni was actually a curse word back in olden times so for me that added to the humor of the scene n nand unlike virtually every dvd released the all the extras are worth checking out and also boasts what i think is the only movie that offers for your listening pleasure a mono soundtrack in glorious old fashioned mono plus as an added bonus there is a glorious 24 seconds absolutely free although do n t ask me where that is from there are also there rare audio commentaries that are actually interesting one with terry gilliam and terry jones and another with john cleese eric idle and michael palin also there a plenty of great documentaries three sin alongs and a cast directory to keep track of how many characters each actor played and if you ca n t get enough ridiculousness you can watch the film in japanese with english subtitles as they search for the holy sake cup and even a lego version of the film no seriously well at least a scene of them and there s even an educational film on to use your coconuts and really what else do you need in your life
7;32;36;0.8303235213564504;as a teacher of medieval grail literature i have shown monty python and the holy grail to many generations of students and indeed there are a number of scenes that really do help young people understand either the medieval literary tradition or medieval history these include not only the unforgettable bring out your dead scene which educates the fortunate modern viewer on the ubiquity of the medieval bubonic plague but also the grail castle with its unimaginable and unaskable question not to mention the over the top battle ethos that would lead to a knight s having not only his arms and legs cut off but also his head it s hard to believe that such scenes have their medieval progenitors though i do have to say i know of no medieval precedent for the shrubbery scene but honestly they do n nmore than that however in my book the very best scene of this film has absolutely nothing to do with the grail or with anything medieval and that is the scene of the fierce rabbit i still can not watch this film without cracking up as we moderns say over the scene in which the harmless little rabbit attacks the arthurian troupe the hubris that the rabbit scene uncovers is a sadly but hilariously universal feature of human nature n nbut even the rabbit scene hooks back into the medieval theme as it links to an exploration of a cave with literary texts that conclude because arrgh well indeed many medieval texts remain unfinished perhaps because the authors died more likely due to the vagaries of preservation so monty python has something to say not only about history and literature but about literary history in its very aesthetic form this film reminds us that the standard linear narrative is not the only way of organizing a story many medieval stories are likewise structured either allegorically or with significant disruptions such as this film has that reveal that a story is something that is constructed and has its gaps and interventions n nin the age of the da vinci code another far less successful grail story i d be happy to see folks go back to monty python for their understanding of medieval literature and chrisitainity maybe they d learn that all enigmas are not meant to be solved some are meant to be the topic of cleansing and cathartic laughter
8;54;55;0.8295713773567371;what can you say about a film whose script has been virtually memorized by legions of fans since its release in 1975 n n fetchez la vache bring out your dead english knnnnn iggets how do you noo she is a witch castle anthrax of course it s a good idea some call me tim it s only a flesh wound are you suggesting that coconuts migrate the holy hand grenade of antioch answer me these questions three n neach of these quotes will immediately be recognized by grail fans the list of memorable lines and sight gags goes on and on n nthe film itself is the greatest of all comedies by the greatest of all comedy troupes no small intellect is behind the script and no insignificant amount of historical knowledge either the actors avoid playing their parts with self knowing irony which gives viewers the a chance to get or miss the humor on their own as much fun as the film are the director s commentaries and various shorts depicting the search for castles not as easy as it might be supposed and the shooting of the film itself two sad truths graham chapman is no longer with us and john cleese has developed into perhaps always was an insufferable bore ah well i m over it n n holy grail is a daffy delicious send up of socialist politics encounters with the divine sir gawain and the green knight the grail romances medieval science and the perils of living in a verminous and crud bestrewn land for anyone with an intellectual sense of humor this is a dvd you are guaranteed to watch over and over again
9;58;62;0.8057657961012892;this review is about the collector s set specifically if you already have the special edition dvd you already have the exact same 2 discs that come with this set but if you want to have it all then this is the set to get it includes a collectible film cell a small booklet containing the transcript of the movie and a nifty book like case the extra features on these disc are outstanding again the same features you get with the se dvd the animated menus are hilarious and i especially like the lego rendition of the camelot song nthe one thing about the collector s set that s kind of annoying they have only one peg to put the dvds onto so one of your dvds is put directly on top of the other one the top disc tends to fall off the peg and could potentially get scratched in shipment like my first one did before i exchanged it also when you securely fasten the discs they can be kinda hard to take out just an annoyance but probably the only way they could ve put the discs in this kind of book like case overall a great gift or personal purchase if your a fan and want to get the definitive set with collectible extras

11;55;19;0.7511295916369181;please be very careful if you order this edition of the classic monty python comedy as i have just learned the hardest way possible the center pegs in the case require a lot of care and patience when inserting or removing a disc too much force will cause the disc to bend and break n nthe center pegs are made of a hard plastic that s all one piece therefore making it almost impossible to remove the discs without risking breaking it as much as i love this movie i have to give this set 3 stars just because the way the case was made caused me to accidentally ruin the bonus disc which i was very excited to watch n noh well at least i got the screenplay out of it once again this review has nothing to do with the movie i love the movie i just hate the way they made this case
12;21;13;0.7398655126131541;love the movie one of my favorites love the transfer to blu ray crystal clear for the most part a few scenes were apparently more problematic to transfer and are still pretty blurry and it can be jarring when you come across those scenes because they really do stand out the extras are limited but interesting and informative with the possible exception of terry gilliam s commentary on the lost animation sequences he really did n t sound very happy to be doing them n nhowever the ultraviolet digital copy feature on this disc which is adminstered by sony is entirely worthless you may think you are getting an actual copy of the movie to watch on your ipod ipad or other device at your leisure right wrong the downloadable copy is for your desktop or other primary computer only and in order to get that you must create an account with sony give them your personal information and install their proprietary software silverlight to download and view the copy after giving them my name email and other information and agreeing to allow them to send me marketing materials at that email address which you must do to proceed with the account creation there is no way to opt out and still continue jumping through all the installation hoops and installing silverlight it took my computer an additional 6 and one half hours over high speed dsl to download this 90 munite epic amazing speed and efficiency no incidentally the download also overheated and burned out my old dsl modem n nafter all that i tried to transfer the downloaded movie to itunes guess what you ca n t if you want to download it to a mobile device you have to install additional software go through the ultraviolet site again and essentially repeat the download process on that device god only knows how long it will take to download it agfain using an a5 chip then you can view the movie at your leisure on your mobile device right not according to the folks who have tried it if you are foolish enough to remove your mobile device from your house you re out of luck you see if you get outside the range of your wifi connection the movie will not be viewable apparently the digital copy needs to contact sony every time you try to view it just a little quirk that sony forgot to mention to you want to take a copy of the movie on vacation too bad long car or plane ride too bad maybe someone should call sony and inform them of the meaning of the word mobile so they stop advertising their digital copy for your mobile device n nso buy this blu ray version movie if you only want the movie itself and do not want the digital copy sorry i keep putting it in quotes but i feel like if there is no actual copy of the film that you can move around between devices in what sense do you have an actual copy of anything go ahead and buy it frankly i ca n t recommend the movie enough just do n t expect to be able to use the digital copy that comes with it n nps there are a number of movies like james cameron s new release of titanic on blu ray that come with actual bona fide digital copies you plug a download code into itunes and it downloads automatically and you can watch that on any device you transfer a copy to just look for the little itunes logo on the cover and stay away from anything marked with ultraviolet ultraviolet is not worth the money not worth the hassle not worth the time in short uv copies are worthless
13;31;11;0.5697789635634272;i purchased this in part to upgrade to blu ray from the dvd i already own and because it came with the ultraviolet digital copy so far as i am aware it is relatively new to blu ray and yet the slip of paper which has the redemption code for the ultraviolet copy is already expired and indeed does not work so if you were planning to purchase this at all based on it coming with a digital copy you will not really be getting a digital copy amazon needs to amend their listings for things like this otherwise it would seem like false advertising as you are not getting what you pay for and before reading this review you would not know that the digital copy was expired until after you had opened the package

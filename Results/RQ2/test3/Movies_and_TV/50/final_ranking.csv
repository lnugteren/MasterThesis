0;20;9;0.8645608928718961;my favorites of the austen stories are actually pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility either of which i will watch in film because there is precious little they can do other than totally butcher the stories that makes them anything but delightful to watch my enjoyment of a cinematic mansfield park however is greatly dependant on its rendition and this one is my favorite largely because it is the most sympathetic of them n ni ve seen at least one version that suggests that sir thomas bertram was virtually a pedophile that really did n t go over it s not that it could n t have been so given human nature i would be more surprised if it had n t happened on occasion but it s just not my jane austen more like dickens in this version sir thomas is a well meaning if somewhat socially bigoted person in his world money equates to quality and little fanny price has little to recommend her that he gradually grows to appreciate her good sense and to actually treat her with the affection of a real parent makes him a wonderful character because he above all of the others actually grows by his experiences in fact more than any of them he is actually aware of the experiences in the first place n nthe most stellar of the characters however is that of lady bertram played brilliantly by angela pleasance the daughter of the character actor donald pleasance her languid indifference to her life captures more fully than anything else the total emptiness of her position at the top of the social ladder her children are raised by others her household is managed by others her every decision is made for her by others one senses a beautiful if perhaps mentally vacant daughter of a modestly well off social climbing family who managed to carry off the most eligible bachelor of her generation as her prize for simply having existed that says a lot about the society of the time and about its attitude towards the value of women having had the heir and a spare as required she retired to a sort of mental oblivion it is only when engaged by fanny that she actually energizes and takes part in what goes on in her world fanny bestows her full attention on lady bertram as though she were present and not transparent unlike the attitude of the rest of the family n nhere too the daughters maria and julia are much more sympathetic maria decides to marry for money but her alternative of marrying for love was so obviously a poor one given her selection that one ca n t help but feel that her actual choice was the best one she does n t seem to have been an unpleasant person simply an ill fated one the outcome of julia s marriage to mr yeates was so little touched upon that one can only hope for her happiness who knows perhaps even maria will be happier sidelined by divorce n naunt norris is the official bad guy of the family she is so obsequious to her brother in low sir thomas and so disparing of the young fanny that she is obnoxious in the extreme the former is understandable since she is to some extent dependant on sir thomas s good will however the latter is due to her need to feel better than her neice fanny she lacks anything of the real humility of her neice and assumes all of the responsiblity for what she perceives as putting the man in her debt ie the advantageous marriage of his daughter maria and eschews any responsibility for her wrong decisions ie her support of the theatrical activities of the younger bertrams to be honest she is a survivor in a world that leaves little margin for error in social sensitivity and to err is to be plunged into disaster still when she is packed off to live with maria one ca n t help but feel she got her just cumupance n nthe crawford brother and sister pair are perhaps the least likeable but then they re not supposed to be they are the personification of all that s objectionable about high society or at least different from the rest of it they are foils for the practical good sense of fanny and that which throws the country cousins off the right path they are the beautiful people of their time spoiled bored ignorant of or indifferent to the realities of others lives n na fine presentation of the story and my favorite
1;9;26;0.8634553373048798;for my money this is the best most accurate dramatization of a jane austen novel n nwhy n n the dramatizers based it heavily on the book much of the dialogue is taken straight out of mp and very few liberties are taken with incident or language n n where dialoge has been added it is well written and consistent with what miss austen wrote and with the characters of the story n n it unfurls itself at a slow pace almost as if you were reading the novel for some this might be tedious but if you do n t like this production you probably wo n t like the mp the novel either n n sylvestra le touzel does a nice job of bringing fanny price to life i felt that the little eccentricities that she added the chopping that one reviewer referred to starts shrieks and even that hysterical bout of crying in the east room were a believable part of those awkwardnesses that were as good as graces that austen describes in her they show a repressed 18 year old girl in an uncomfortable social situation muddling through i thought she made fanny likeable and believeable n n robin langford is mr yates it s worth the price of the dvd just to hear him say theatre n nbest characterizations are edmund sir thomas tom bertram and mrs norris while the latter is certainly more strident in the novel it s easier to understand sir thomas keeping her around when her poisoned barbs are delivered with a veneer of pleasantness n nless ideal is lady bertram while anyone who has read the novel might interpret her strange slow speech as langour to someone who has n t she might well come across as mentally ill however she is funny if you can get past the mannerisms n ni was disappointed with the crawfords though the actress who played mary crawford is very good but does n t look the part and that dark wig is very distracting i would rather see her natural color the black hair is too obviously wrong for her complexion n nthe actor playing henry crawford looks far too young for the part and does n t have the mature confidence and subtlety that henry crawford exudes in the book he looks like he s trying too hard to be seductive and about as much of a threat to maria bertram as a high school boy coming on to his teacher conversely the actor who plays william price looks too old for the part trying to act young in those scenes where he s hugging fanny i kept thinking get your hands off her i wonder if the drama would have been better if they had switched the two had robert burbage play william price and allan hendrick play henry crawford n nnevertheless i think anyone who appreciates jane austen ought to at least see this lovingly done version of mansfield park it s a relic of the good old days of bbc production intelligent authentic and skillfully acted
2;25;13;0.7934365674447444;this bbc adaption of mansfield park faithfully follows jane austen s story of a quiet heroine who overcomes the odds to marry the man who has captured her heart fanny price must be a sore trial for an actress for most scenes she must sit silent or speak just a few words her body language is likewise restrained in this version we have a lovable fanny who signals expressively with her eyes indicating a depth of emotion and anguish that captures the heart she is supported by an able ensemble cast who are all flawless in their roles from the amiable edmund bertram to the evil henry crawford n nin mansfield park jane austen turns her caustic eye on the situation of the poor relation fanny price is the daughter of a gently born lady who married a naval officer now sunk by alcoholism and injury to a life on shore in portsmouth fanny s mother has two sisters mrs norris who married a clergyman and lady bertram wife to sir thomas these two wind up off handedly bringing fanny to mansfield park as a child where the main object is to impress upon her how inferior her status is to her cousins and how grateful she should be because of this dark undertone there is less humor in the situation but by the same token fanny s eventual triumph is much larger n nif you want stars and glamor go elsewhere but for the money this is the best and most faithful rendering of jane austen s observant novel
3;6;27;0.782976502805823;this production is notable for its faithfulness to the novel however its main strength is also its main handicap resulting in a production that adheres so strictly to the book that it feels drawn out and slow at points the exception to this is the end scene which wraps up the story too quickly n nlike the other early bbc austen productions there are occasional swerves into silliness that are n t intentional and can be distracting sylvestra le touzel as fanny emphasizes her speeches with odd hand gestures mr crawford looks like a bipedal mouse in pants and his sister mary who is supposed to be so lovely looks about the same except in a bad 80 s wig and a dress i giggle just thinking about mr yeats s wig n nstill there are some good points on the balance i liked le touzel as fanny and alison fiske did very well as mrs price angela pleasence s aunt bertram reminded me an awful lot of jessica tate from soap but i still liked her very much the costumes and sets are fine but not remarkable and the sound for the outdoor scenes is mediocre to poor n non the whole i d say that this is a solid but not great production it s not a bad choice but do n t expect it to be as attractive or interesting as other more recent austen productions such as a e s pride and prejudice or 1995 s sense and sensibility
4;36;7;0.7310010030548232;there are some films usually interpretations of great literature that are as fresh as the day they were released mansfield park bbc 1986 is one of them and joins the ranks of franco zeffirelli s romeo and juliet 1966 and the bbc s pride and prejudice colin firth 1994 the casting setting screen play and the interpretation of jane austen s great art could not be improved as the nytimes critic said of the just mentioned pride and prejudice it almost bested the book i do n t know anyone who has seen the film who disagrees with this estimation
5;14;3;0.7303058196131382;this 1980 s version of mansfield park is much truer to the novel than either the 1999 movie or the 2007 tv adaptation of the same name unfortunately this does n t mean it s any better it s just bad in its own odd way n nthe most jarring element in this production is sylvestra le touzel s portrayal of fanny price le touzel looking like a victorian doll or a dw griffith star acts as if fanny just escaped from a mental ward or should be in one throughout the series she makes strange little slashes with her hands whenever she talks i think this is supposed to show her earnestness but instead it starts to look as if she s practicing some bizarre sort of kung fu or as if she s patting an invisible dog n n austen s fanny price is gentle repressed but upright instead le touzel alternates between cold blankness hysteria she becomes so shrill and gibbering during her scene with sir thomas i ended up fastforwarding the scene and abruptly shouted no s making it impossible to understand why so many characters find her endearing she is both erratic and insufferable le touzel later redeemed herself as the comic clothes minded mrs allen in northanger abbey n nmost of the other characters with the exception of angela pleasence s deranged lady bertram are well done cinematic mary crawfords have always fared better than cinematic fanny prices and jackie smith wood brings wit and warmth to the role bernard hepton gives sir thomas the right amount of gravitas and graciousness nicholas farrell a longtime favorite is also very good as edmund bertram despite that character s occasional pomposity n nin staying scrupulously faithful to the novel the script includes virtually all the novel s dialogue to the detriment of pacing and plot it plods until two thirds of the way through when it suddenly picks up speed and interest to the point of cramming in too many events and resolutions all at once n nlike so many other reviewers i am still hoping for a mansfield park that stays true to austen s characters while streamlining the story and mining all the humor that exists within the text
6;32;5;0.7294221493374252;i checked this 1986 bbc six part series of mansfield park out of the library and absolutely loved it i think that some of the 1980s bbc productions including pride and prejudice number among its best and this production certainly serves as an example despite the understandably given its age shop worn appearance of the print the costumes and settings glitter with elegance n nthe actors are as good as is to be expected in a bbc series the only character i thought was unreal was angela pleasance whose lady bertram was so out of it that she suggested that her ladyship s problem was an addiction to laudanum however i liked anna massey s caustic interpretation of aunt norris a thoroughly unlikable character whose constant belittling of poor relation fanny price has caused that young woman to become self effacing with feelings of unworthiness among the splendid surroundings of her betters ms le touzel portrays fanny with such repression that at times one would like to shake her in contrast to fanny s diffidence mary crawford the vicar s sister in law sparkles with wit and emerges as a modern character who might be a heroine in the twenty first century but since she has a mind of her own is thoroughly out of place in the early nineteenth n nfanny s character becomes understandable and sympathetic when after seven years she goes home to her family in portsmouth and she realises the contrast between life in cramped quarters with her over worked disorganised mother and her drunken father and life in solitary elegance at mansfield park her endurance of her rather second best existence at mansfield allows her to endure her six weeks at portsmouth where she is equally unappreciated we are happy when rescue comes in the form of a recall to the park and she takes her sister with her to partake in what will be a satisfying jane austen future n nyou know you re watching a good series based on a jane austin novel when even though absolutely nothing of importance happens for 266 minutes you love every one of them and do n t want it to end n ni watched all six episodes of this series at one sitting
7;31;4;0.6659495942205748;most reviews have covered the bases this to me is the most faithful to the book altho slow like the book other adaptions either cut too much out or took too many liberties n nif the viewer has read the book she or he will appreciate the faithfulness of the characters story and acting if not the story may seem boring and dragging but the book itself read that way at least the first time around n ni highly commend this version above all others it taught me to appreciate the book and read it anew

0;2;5;0.6225068363121268;this special edition turned out to be not so special after all okay the new transfer is better looking than the previous release but the movie itself remains the same old version missing a good bit of the car chase which for some reason was included in european copies but was never shown in the us n nthe missing part check it out on imdb takes place when roy scheider s wife rushing to the tv studio with the tape drives into a back alley with patrol cars on her tail there she skids into a wall on two wheels bangs the roof of her car then resumes her crazy run as the patrol cars slam into each other and this is what makes scheider wince from his chopper above n napart from leaving aside a nice piece of stunt work this cut also accounts for a continuity loophole when we see the car drive into the tv studio parking lot with a badly battered rooftop n ngranted this missing part is no big deal but it certainly makes this so called special edition a bit of a disappointment n nfive stars for the movie three for the dvd

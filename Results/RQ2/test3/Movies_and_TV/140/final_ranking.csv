0;47;46;0.91374766844904;any book or film purporting to examine the life of the roman emperor gaius caligula must necessarily look deep into a tormented soul caligula which means little boots a nickname the future emperor picked up in the army camp of his famous father germanicus ruled for a mere four years from 37 to 41 ad but managed to alienate almost every member of the roman government during that time what we do know about caligula which is actually very little comes from suetonius a historian in the employ of the emperor hadrian nearly 100 years after caligula s reign suetonius paints a picture of an insane tyrant a power mad figure that murdered tortured tormented and flaunted his unlimited power over the roman empire until his brutal assassination unfortunately the historian tacitus s treatment of caligula s reign was lost to the ages long ago leaving us with little else to go on concerning this interesting man from eons ago nin the 1970 s bob guccione the publisher of penthouse magazine got together with writer gore vidal and film director tinto brass to create a film version of caligula s life this film was not going to be a whitewash but an attempt to create a version of life in rome true to the historical accounts a movie unflinching in its portrayal of the violence and decadence of that ancient empire there are various cuts of caligula floating around in video store limbo but the unrated version is the one you need to get in order to see all of the ubiquitous grotesqueness an added extra on the disc a making of documentary about the film is immensely interesting to watch because it shows you the beginning of the controversy that eventually plagued the film according to this behind the scenes footage the original name of the film was gore vidal s caligula a title changed after vidal s arguments with brass and guccione over some of the explicit content became irreconcilable the interviews with the three principals reveal the beginnings of this argument it is a nice for a film buff to see a record of this titanic clash of egos completely apart from the disagreements over the content of the film this dvd extra does a great job of showing how the craftsmen made the excellent set pieces for this epic film nas most people know the film stars some of the biggest names in hollywood including sir john gielgud as nerva peter o toole as the emperor tiberius helen mirren kept on a strict leash so to speak and malcolm mcdowell as the deranged caligula almost all of the stars distanced themselves from the movie after its release probably due to guccione and brass s instance on inserting decidedly indecent scenes while none of the stars appear in these explicit inserts the repugnance of these images would send any mainstream actor shrieking for the door in short the film is pornographic and therefore potentially damaging to big name thespians nopinions about this movie tend to be polarized some love the dramatic set pieces the over the top acting by mcdowell and o toole and the atmosphere of a time long gone others see caligula as total trash full of bad acting an overlong running time and disgusting imagery i think the response to this epic should lie somewhere in the middle that mcdowell does occasionally rise to grandeur in his depiction of this unsettled figure at other times his performance seems forced and grating witness his crazy laughter on the beach while the legions collect seashells i laughed aloud at his pitiful attempt to portray a delusional madman in this scene o toole and gielgud do a good job with what they have to work with and die off quickly enough to protect themselves from most of the critical backlash ni enjoy films about the roman empire with a few notable exceptions the lessons learned about the dangers of unlimited power concentrated in the hands of one man should continue to serve as warnings for rulers throughout the ages if this film helps to teach that lesson all to the better i suspect it wo n t though because it is difficult to take caligula seriously at times i recommend reading suetonius his biographical sketches of emperors from julius caesar to domitian provide a much more helpful account of power run amok than this film does he also includes sordid details too outrageous for even this movie moreover a reading of suetonius s sketch on caligula reveals some possible motives about why caligula acted as he did something the movie does not do as well give it a shot if you must but be ready for gratuitous violence and highly charged eroticism by the way the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired it is grainy at times and is not the best transfer job ever done for a film
1;45;44;0.896344946375982;this 1979 film is reminiscent of fellini satyricon 1969 and i claudius 1974 from the first it takes the monumental doom laden sets and the cast of loonies being depraved from the second it takes the snarling personal politics of royalty attempting to rule a worldwide empire n nthe sets really are superb enormous attention to detail and a collection of the world s best set and costume designers make this film a work of art the actors all put in a fine job except that o toole and mcdowell get to overact on more than one occasion showing the lack of directorial control that bedevils the film n nforget about historical correctness most evidence has been lost true for most periods in history and what remains is partial and biased written by members of the senatorial class whom caligula attacked the film is both memorable and convincing however which can not be said about many historical films n nthe pornography is a sales device that is we are told that guccione interpolated sex scenes after the film was finished and that this alienated the director tinto brass who removed his name from the credits but tinto is into pornography and helped organise the final orgy which seems really typical of the free love 70s the pornography is restricted to one scene the senatorial brothel integral to the depiction of caligula s humiliation of the senate elsewhere it is little more than nudity and the romans did n t wear many clothes except on formal occasions and a couple of flashes of two actresses labia the brothel scene did have several scenes of fellatio and one insertion but these scenes were not emphasised they added to the effect of the scene and effectively so n nalthough the motives of all concerned with the film are reasonably suspect it did succeed in depicting roman times roman morality and roman politics in a believable manner lack of an integrated directorial style may have caused caligula to fall short of being a great film but it is a very interesting failure indeed and was america in the 70s like this too
2;40;39;0.8872448110218739;some describe caligulia as the most controversial film of its era while this is debatable it is certainly one of the most embarassing virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it author gore vidal actually sued with mixed results to have his name removed from the film and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence what they wanted of course was for it to go away nfor a while it looked like it might caligula was a major box office and critical flop producer guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all and although the film was released on vhs to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re edited and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade but now caligulia is on dvd available in both edited r and original unrated versions and no doubt gielgud is glad he did n t live to see it happen nthe only way to describe caligulia is to say it is something like deep throat meets david lynch s dune by way of fellini having an off day vidal s script fell into the hands of penthouse publisher bob guccione who used vidal s reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars and then threw out most of vidal s script and brought in soft porn director tinto brass then when guccione felt brass work was n t explicit enough he and giancarlo lui photographed hardcore material on the sly nviewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination there is a tremendous amount of nudity and that remains in the edited version but the original comes complete with xxx scenes there is very explicit gay lesbian and straight sex kinky sex and a grand orgy complete with dancing roman guards thrown in for good measure the film is also incredibly violent and bloody with rape torture and mutilation the order of the day in one particularly disturbing scene a man is slowly stabbed to death a woman urinates on his corpse and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs nin the accompanying documentary guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan rome if so he missed the mark we know very little about caligula and what little we know is questionable at best that aside orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of roman society where adultry was an offense punishable by death and certainly ancient rome never looked like the strange slightly oriental oddly space age sets and costumes offered by the designers non the plus side those sets and costumes are fantastically beautiful and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice the score is also very very good the most successful member of the cast is helen mirren who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the empress caesonia gielgud and o toole also escape in reasonably good form the same can not be said for mcdowell but in justice to him he does n t have much to work with as for the dvd itself the film is presented in its original ratio but the term restored applies to previously censored scenes not to the film itself and the quality is so so an unintentionally hilarious documentary is also included on the disk nmy final thoughts the movie does possess a dark fascination but ultimately it is an oddity more interesting for its design and flat out weirdness than for content some of the bodies on display including mcdowell s are extremely beautiful and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography but then again some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstenance and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism if you re up to it it is worth seeing once but once is likely to be enough i suggest you rent it first
3;19;18;0.8866213386479969;the caligula blu ray imperial edition is identical in content to the dvd edition that i reviewed last year there is no exclusive content on this high def release to call it high def is n t really correct because i do n t suppose caligula is ever going to look too great even on bluray nevertheless the bluray transfer offers a bit of an improvement over the dvd version especially in the alternative version print the alternative footage has been re mastered for this edition so that the footage matches the quality of the rest of the film this is a huge improvement over the dvd which left the new footage faded and dirty the colors of caligula have never looked better than they do here although there is still an excessive amount of grain in many scenes due to the condition of the source material this edition includes a smaller sized version of the booklet included with the dvd edition sadly the beautiful fold out packagaing and slipcase are replaced by the cheap standard blu ray case the edition is now on 2 discs instead of three if you love caligula or collect the various video releases of this film then this release is a must have it is the best caligula has ever looked although it is still far from perfect n ndvd review n nthis new edition of caligula is entirely superior to any previous video release of the film in fact i suspect it probably looks better here than it did in theatres image has spared no expense in this stuning imperial edition and it is so lavish and luxurious that it would have no doubt pleased the emperor caligula himself the most important feature of this release is of course how the film looks and sounds i ve owned every previous release of this film including the beta video tape and the laserdisc and i truly felt like i was watching the movie for the first time caligula is never going to look too sharp and clear simply because of the way tinto brass photographed it but i think in this edition we now have the film in it s ultimate form the colors are bright and vibrant and background details of the awesome sets by danilo donati can now be seen for the first time lines of dialogue that i had never been able to make out before now come clearly from my speakers for the first time it is simply amazing what image has done with the prints speaking of which we now have an entirely new cut of the film and it is a masterwork gone is all of bob guccione s hardcore pornography and lets face it that is what it was and instead we are able to see for the first time the beautiful footage that brass shot for scenes like the tiberius grotto and the bordello ship the film also unfolds differently with scenes restored to their intended running order as scripted by gore vidal the woods sequence no longer opens the film but appears in an extended form with never before seen footage in it s proper place in the middle of the film i will say that the editing on all of the new footage is a bit rough and it does not appear to have been cleaned up as much as the rest of the film stock but this is a minor complaint still there is so much more to this edition of caligula than just the two cuts of the film there are three theatrical trailers that are real treasures there are also three marvelous commentary tracks from malcolm mcdowell helen mirren and journalist ernest volkman these often humorous commentaries alone would be worth the price of the video but there is so much more there is a half hour interview with john longinus steiner a full half hour interview with lori wagner the actress who played agripina or was it messillina in the guccione porn footage most importantly there is an in depth interview with director tinto brass that is fascinating and still there is more more more how about an hours worth of deleted and extended scenes this footage has not been remastered and it is often in rough shape but it is still amazing to see it there is also around an hours worth of behind the scenes footage the documentary on the making of gore vidal s caligula is imported here from the 20th anniversary dvd release but this time there are two versions one long and one short can you believe it there are also extensive still photo archives that will take you a long time to watch and trust me these photos are worth looking at and they will show you a lot about how caligula was made there are loads of photos of tinto brass directing as well as fotos of gore i m taking my name off this vidal on the set as if all this was not enough you can put the disc in your computer and read not one but two versions of the gore vidal screenplay as well as the complete novel based on the screenplay there are also photos of the penthouse pets who did the porno footage as well as an unintentionally funny interview with bob guccione now we all owe a great debt to bob without whom there would have been no caligula at least not as we know it today but i ve got ta say that he comes off as a pretty crazy fellow in the magazine interviews and to here him blathering on interminably about art and excellence and trying to appear sophisticated had me doubled over with laughter not surprisingly no one in the commentaries or interviews has much nice to say about him tinto brass gives him the easiest time i suppose but if bob had not decided to take an already risque film and insert some explicit porn into it i doubt very much whether we would still be sitting around talking about caligula today and now we have the best of both worlds because those who love caligula for its porno aspects have disc one and those who love caligula as a historical art film have disc two and those who just want a cool fast paced sword and sandal kind of thing or a version you can share with your grandmother can buy the new r rated release that is sold seperately and also looks and sounds spectacular i forgot to mention that the imperial edition comes in a high quality slip case and fold out inner keepcase with beautiful artwork of the cast each of the three discs feature a photo of a different cast member mcdowell mirren and o toole now certainly this is the longest review i ever wrote for amazon but it is also the most spectacular release i have ever seen of any dvd it truly sets a new standard for what a special edition should be congratulations to all involved
4;127;126;0.8765206347381898;maybe in your dreams gore vidal most of our dreams even the ones with the endless tunnels and the abrupt falls off high cliffs are quite a bit more coherent than caligula the title of this review is a direct quote lifted off the hour long making of special bundled with this uncut version of the controversial 1979 release now to qualify everything i ve said so far quoting vidal is a little unfair during the special penthouse publisher and at least one time movie producer bob guccione always refers to the movie as gore vidal s caligula whatever sweet spring of good feelings the principals enjoyed during the making of special had apparently soured by the time the movie was released vidal disowned the film prior to release and his credit is the rather clumsy adapted from an original screenplay by and uncut version is usually called director s cut but here there s no director the special identifies someone named tinto brass as the director someone the overhead narrator approvingly characterizes as sex obsessed by the time the film was released brass was no longer director and his screen credit was the meager principle photography by as far as i can tell brass was a soft porn sleaze meister of minor accomplishments his major achievement prior to caligula being something called salon kitty a 1976 sexploitation flick about a brothel keeper in germany during world war ii n n caligula does have its share of heavy hitters malcolm mcdowell plays the title character peter o toole is the disease ridden tiberius and john gielgud plays the moral roman senator nerva tragically gielgud s character dies thirty minutes into the movie o toole s dies about fifteen minutes later and we re left with two more hours of movie a lot of the remaining two hours are filled with orgies punctuated now and then with disgusting scenes of gratuitous violence the plot fits in there someplace sometimes just as long as it does n t get in the way of the orgies n n frankly this is a mess the sets are big and gaudy but poorly lit and phony looking mcdowell s caligula is simply repellent as are all the other characters after nerva s death the sex is soft core that verges towards the hard stuff now and then there are a lot of naked penthouse pets in this one but watching them get it on with each other is no less boring than any other uninspired porn offering i would n t recommend caligula to any but the curious and only then as a rental
5;77;76;0.8741629092882122;it s nearly 30 years since caligula was released onto an expectant or is it more correct to say an unexpectant global cinema audience and they were not to be disappointed stage and cinema royalty including sir peter o toole sir john gielgud and dame helen mirren only gielgud was knighted at the time joined malcolm mcdowell and a collection of italian and european actors in an orgy of violence and sex which included graphic xxx pornography taken directly from the pages of seutonius chapter on caligula in the second century book the twelve caesars n nthis marvellous 3 disc dvd set contains fascinating documentaries featuring extensive interviews with producer bob guccione and writer gore vidal shot at the time of production the full uncut 156 minute version features on the first disc the second disc has a shorter version which has wonderful commentary tracks by mirren and mcdowell alas the 200 plus minute guccione edited version which was rumoured to have been shown to preview audiences in italy is not included in this set and in fact may no longer exist n nit is now well known that the film that vidal wrote and director tinto brass shot are not what was finally released after guccione took control of the editing and shut brass out of the production to bridge huge continuity gaps guccione and his editors extensively used out takes and rehearsal footage rescued from rubbish bins the documentary material provides fascinating information about what might have been a masterpiece had brass been allowed to edit the film he shot and do pick up shots retakes and the shooting of much needed new scenes which would become self evident in the editing stage n nthanks to the documentary material we get to fully appreciate the incredible production design the magnitude and details of the various sets and the beautiful costumes made by production designer danilo donati and his team this is not always evident in the finished film n nthere is a wonderful interview with the very erudite john steiner a british actor who built a short but spectacular career in italian exploitation films in the 1970s steiner shaved his head to play the slimey longinus character now a real estate agent in england steiner s witty comments about the making of the film are worth the price of the dvd set alone n nas time goes by caligula will continue to be restudied and reassessed no doubt it will gain in stature but unlike the other caligula film of cinema legend the lost 1937 i claudius featuring charles laughton as claudius and emlyn williams as caligula we have ample material to study and assess thanks to this excellent dvd collection
6;20;19;0.8604251091333703;every fan of movies should be forced to watch caligula as an ascetic exercise at least once for only in discovering how bad cinema can be are we able to fully appreciate how good it can be and the good news is that the film has a message absolute power corrupts absolutely that is the end of the good news nas an historical drama caligula completely fails to capture any sense of time and place while some of the scenes depicted such as the emperor tiberius swimming with his little fishes are based on historical sources it seems as though it could have taken place on mars the sets and costumes are incredibly garish or silly sacrificing any suspension of disbelief the camera work is amateurish it zips around losing its subject and often delivering an unclear picture due to what seems to be inadequate lighting or a failure to focus on the subject the picture is grainy throughout and tough on the eyes nas an artistic hard core porno flick caligula is boring and not the slightest bit titillating the sexuality is displayed between frequent and extremely gruesome acts of violence the multitude of which i will not catalogue here suffice it to say the movie should not be watched while eating also when trying to advance the plot if caligula has one the hard core scenes are exasperating in their ability to delay the progression and break down whatever narrative quality the film might have had nother reviews speak adequately as to the story of how this train wreck of a movie occurred so i wo n t go into it i can suggest however that you will likely never see such an a list cast in such an awful movie ever again the included documentary is laughable guccione is really convinced he is making a truly important film and the casting reflects that nnow the only dramatic alternative i know of to caligula that covers the same period is i claudius while claudius runs 668 minutes and caligula runs 155 i can guarantee you that the latter seems to go on much longer forever in fact you emerge from viewing it wondering what in the world you just watched and whether or not viewing a film can actually make you a less noble person but i know you are curious so have at it just remember you were warned
7;39;38;0.8425341673817508;tinto brass caligula is a film with balls both literally and figuratively loaded with over the top set design and egregious nudity caligula is often unfairly brushed off as an expensive porn flick in fact what seems agregious to us now might not even be a slight exaggeration as regards the roman empire in the early ad s apparently this film is one of the more realistic accounts of the debauchery of the time indeed the marketing does not shy away from this the tagline read something along the lines of the only film to show the true side of ancient rome if the film s content is any indication i would think so n ncaligula has cult written all over it as well as other c words this is not a great film but it is a great movie perfect to pop in in the middle of the night if you are bored intoxicated or both as far as escapist fare goes caligula goes well with the midnight show dress up aficionados it would be just plain fun perhaps even a double feature with rocky horror n nthe sets are outrageous but that s the point malcolm mcdowell s acting job is surprisingly good if a bit over the top but who said that s a bad thing peter o toole puts in a decent albeit short lived performance as tiberius n nmy biggest qualm however with caligula is the editing the hardcore scenes are more than unnecessary and the fluidity of scenes and scene changes is almost incomprehensible at times blame guccione for this he locked brass out of the editing room n noverall i could not give caligula anything higher than 3 stars out of 5 although i sometimes wish i could 4 stars is blow up and dirty harry territory and i would feel uncomfortable having them share the glory with such infamy n n nfun over the top visually stimulating among other things a good conversation piece and a great time capsule artifact
8;17;16;0.7626776898373157;originally intended by its director to be a sarcastic film on the orgy of power in ancient rome caligula became instead an explicitly pornographic film about the power of orgy in the hands of its producer bob guccione publisher of penthouse magazine brass was banished from the edit suite by guccione during post production and guccione edited the film himself putting scenes in the wrong order and inserting hardcore porn sequences starring penthouse pets which he had shot himself n nunfortunately in the uncut version mcdowells performance is somewhat wasted and feels secondary to all of the onscreen sex and it is for this reason that one wishes brass were allowed to complete the film himself n nif you want to watch a good if sexually and violently explicit film then i would recommend the alternative version of caligula the uncut version is not a particularly entertaining film i for one found it very difficult to watch
9;13;12;0.7509303944677796;i feel slightly embarrassed to tell people how much i love this film you should see the looks i get but this film is the guiltiest pleasure there is is it porn no it is n t when you have that urge to view porn caligula is not the first film you rent too much plot it has many hardcore sex scenes but this was all part of an enormous failed experiment to bring porn scenes to legitimate film it did n t work this film is a disaster but because of this the film is very entertaining the first time you see it you wo n t believe what you re watching you ll be asking yourself how why etc regardless if you love it or hate it you ll sit through the entire two and and half hours of it just out of morbid curiosity and bewilderment the same impulse that makes you slow down as you drive past an accident on the highway i m not quite sure what gore vidal was thinking here would n t you think that if you got bob guccione and tinto brass involved in your film that it would be overflowing with sleaze gore ca n t be that dumb in the documentary it s hilarious to watch him talk about the historical and philosophical importance of the movie i bet he feels like a total schmuck and totally ashamed now when he thinks back on that i d love to ask him about it the film tries to be accurate and take itself seriously as a drama but lets cut through here guccione was merely using this as a way to push his sleaze into the mainstream and become an innovative genius in the public s eye the sex scenes are very sleazy and disgusting because they re usually sandwiched between or during scenes of graphic violence making them devoid of any kind of erotic value i love showing or lending this movie to unsuspecting friends coworkers family just to get their reaction there will never be another movie like caligula ever see it once and remember it for the rest of your days a warning though do n t watch on a first date she wo n t be impressed

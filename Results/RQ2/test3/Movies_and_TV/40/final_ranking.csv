0;11;19;0.9355784380393509;the coldest villain in the hottest thriller n nwhen frederick forsyth s the day of the jackal first hit the shelves it became an instant classic it reached such popularity that a movie was but a natural consequence movies have never faithfully reproduced the core essence of books simply because of the minute details only a book could offer try showcasing the iliad in 3 hrs n nbut the movie version of the day of the jackal far exceeded expectations not only does it stick to the original plot but also even to this day it sets the benchmark for how spy thrillers should be n nif you have n t read forsyth s epic yet then let me clue you in general charles de gaulle was considered a hero amongst his men when he fought for the liberation of france from the germans in wwii after becoming france s president the same hero was considered a betrayer after granting algeria independence a clandestine group in the army calling itself the secret army organization or oas for short launches a series of assassination attempts on de gaulle only to see each one destroyed by the highly informed and efficient french secret service after the capture of its key lieutenants and its presiding leader things become desperate for the oas it s new leader in hiding believes that a foreign assassin of exceptional caliber is the only means left to dethrone de gaulle the assassin is known only by his code as jackal this way the entire security network would be crippled for want of the man s identity if you do n t have a name you do n t have a face if you do n t have face you do n t exist you are untraceable n nthe premise is simple enough it is how the jackal plans and executes his operation that takes the bulk of the movie the jackal is a man of perfection and his attention to detail is something to be seen a slight lapse in secrecy by his employers alerts france to begin searching for him though they have no idea who or what he is the job of finding him and disposing him off in total secrecy falls into the unwilling hands of a simple french detective it is how these two protagonists move forward at breakneck speed in achieving their goals that takes the movie to a truly riveting thrilling finale n nedward fox as the jackal is beyond doubt the coldest most ruthless assassin to date fox is perfect for the role his dull cowering gaze is chilling from a staid english gentleman to a remorseless killer fox displays tremendous versatility and poise every action of his has a meaning and behind an immediate plan he has a backup such is fox s repertoire in impersonating as the jackal when i read the book midway through it i was actually rooting for the assassin i felt the same way when watching this movie though i knew the end to my knowledge very few actors have so far delivered such a convincing negative role performance than fox n nmichael lonsdale as the quaint detective lebel is probably the most uncharacteristic hero in any movie he is n t your be all end all savior with hands of steel and body of a superman he does not fit into a mould which you can distinguish as okay i know this kind of a guy and that itself is a tribute to this superb actor he displays coolness in equal measure to the jackal and comes across as a shy and timid man in short he acts as just a detective doing his duty his character is one of intelligence resourcefulness and humility on one side with a quiet steely determination and resolve on the other and lonsdale is magnificent in displaying all of these aspects n ntogether these two protagonists take an already exciting thriller to an explosive finale that is hard to imitate n nthe rest of the cast add a lot of depth and meaning to their respective roles and each character has a major part in pushing forward the story to its worthy conclusion n nin short the day of the jackal is a masterpiece considering the movies we watch today this is slow paced but with reason cheap thrillers always show you how a character dies from the bullet of an assassin but never the preparation for doing so the day of the jackal shows you just how the assassin comes to that point of success from the assassin s meticulous planning to his ultimate execution of that fatal shot the movie shares the same perfection director fred zinnemman has set the standards for future thrillers by foregoing flashiness and instead focusing on the core issues of the book he remains loyal to it and displays a rare cinematic flair that is very hard to beat and do not mistake this movie to the recently released the jackal featuring bruce willis and sydney poitier one movie is a disappointment while the other is a classic n nwatch fox and lonsdale square off each other n nwatch the day of the jackal in all its glory
1;10;30;0.8969900423196359;the day of the jackal is a prime example of an increasingly rare breed a subtle low key action film that is actually willing to respect the intelligence of its audience for evidence of how times have changed for the worse just compare this film to its recent star driven remake edward fox plays the jackal a coolly efficient english assassin who is hired by algerian terrorists to assassinate french president charles degaulle using an almost documetary style the film follows the jackal as he prepares to kill degaulle while a french detective michael lonsdale fights against time to discover just who the jackal actually is and stop him it is a sign of the story s effectiveness that even though the majority of the audience will hopefully be aware that degaulle ended his service as france s president without being killed the film still manages to hold the viewer s attention in a mixture of heart pounding suspense and fascination with watching such a realistic presentation of how a political assassination might very well had been pulled off this is n t a short film but clocking in at 2 and a half hours it is never less than enthralling ndirector fred zinnemann wisely chose to eschew the trendy flashiness that was almost required of films made in the early 70s and which has recently come back to marr so many contemporary action films and instead emphasizes realism in both his action and his characters as a result the jackal and his pursuer never engage in the type of unbelievable acts that have become the trademarks of other action stars they are never more or less than recognizable human beings and that makes the film s story all the more enthralling instead of filling the film with audience pleasing pyrotechnics zinnemann instead uses violence so carefully and so rarely that when the action does explode on screen it has an immediate impact nzinnemann was always known as a brilliant director of actors and the performances in the day of the jackal from a collection of reliable english and french character actors are flawless though his character is usually overshadowed by the more charismatic jackal lonsdale does a good job as the film s nominal hero making this anonymous detective into a sort of everyman however the film belongs to its title character and the actor who plays him edward fox fox has been typecast as stuffy aristocratic types so it is a bit of a revelation to see his performance here he manages to perfectly convey the coldness of a man without a soul while at the same time providing glimpes of a neurotic intensity that would come from living a life that is centered totally and completely on death fox creates a sympathetic screen villian without ever allowing the jackal to become lecterized the viewer never forget that this is a killer and not a warm and cuddly guy with a few eccentricities nthe day of the jackal is a film that seems to be perenially underrated certainly it runs counter to every instinct currently being displayed by the actions films coming out of hollywood which is unfortunate because the current crop of michael bays and simon wests could stand to learn quite a few lessons from fred zinnemann and the day of the jackal
2;33;9;0.8411920146117993;director fred zinnimann s day of the jackal is a rare movie it stays close to the book and it treats it s viewers like they have a brain n n the time is the 60 s and in france president charles degaulle is marked for death after many atemps at his life a group of men wanting him dead hire the jackal a killer for hire to kill him they pick the jackal because he s the best and he always gets the job done edward fox is just right as the cool killer who takes his work very serious n n the feels more like a reality show in the way it follows the killers plan to kill degaulle and is helped by not having a cast of stars in it this thriller willkeep you glued to it til the very end avery well made movie not to be missed
3;29;7;0.8167210357716254;the day of the jackal is one of the best action suspense films ever made it s nothing short of brilliant and it s something of a hidden treasure movie buffs know the movie but sadly it does n t get the sort of mainstream recognition of even a mediocre thriller like the fugitive for instance n nwhat s fantastic about jackal is that it works within the realm of possibility the jackal a british contract killer hired by the oas to assassinate charles de gaulle is cunning effective sharp but human not the near super human killers of movies of the last 20 or so years n nthe drama builds and never relents this is an extraordinary feat considering that the assassin s target is a real historical figure who was never assassinated n nall the main characters were terrifically portrayed if there is a shortfall it is that the french characters have british accents this detracted a bit from the realism it s a minor criticism one that is all but swallowed by the strengths of the movie n nthis is a must see even if you re not a fan of the so called spy fiction genre you ll enjoy the intrigue suspense or in the least all the wonderful shots of italy and france

6;19;10;0.7558782388113853;someone in the above reviews quipped why do n t they make movies like this anymore good question i guess because they re today s producers money driven and willing to pander to the more base instincts of youthful moviegoers in order to achieve just one more week at the box office n nthis is one of the best movies ever made it is plot driven closely sticking to the forsyth book and although it s about the french which probably would n t get as much play today it soon gets you to the edge of your seat and rivets you there n ndegaulle for many reasons but especially for his politics in algiers has numerous attempts on his life remeber that in those post world war times support of the army was critical the role of the army in america probably came to an end in terms of its influential power when president truman spanked general macarthur in front of the entire class in the real world degaulle was an odd fellow somewaht heroic somewhat of an isolationist the oas the french army terrorist cell hires edward fox who looks strangely like david bowie does n t he as the suave well dressed cold blooded killer to assassinate degaulle n npolice procedural scenic fox staying ahead of the police step by step murder rapid but contiguous scene changes just great stuff with great acting by then unknowns several of whom did n t act again n nhighly recommended 5 stars larry scantlebury

1;1.0;5.0;6.0;"From the bestselling book.  Anyone interested in the history of post war France wrapped up in a nail biter, would appreciate the accuracy of this film.  Add to that the directing, acting, and casting, results in a top notch piece of work.  Speaking of casting, relative unknown actors were used on purpose, and it worked beautifully.  The only problem the producers of ""The Jackal"" had, in my view, is that they competed with classics also released in 1973, such as ""The Sting"" and ""American Graffiti,"" among others.  For this reason, ""Jackal"" is not as well known.  Nevertheless, it is among my own top ten movies.  Highly recommended.  Betcha couldn't tell.  Get this movie, and watch it several times so you can grab the little details and nuances.  You won't regret it.";A great historical movie.
26;2.0;5.0;220.0;"Rarely does a movie do justice to a book, but Fred Zinneman's production of ""The Day of the Jackal"" is wonderful adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's novel which, I continue to believe, is one of the greatest thrillers ever written.\nIt's hard to put a finger on what exactly makes this film great: excellent performances by relatively unknown actors, a wonderful plot, fantastic location shooting or a complete desire to avoid the bells and whistles, special effects laden movies that are all that makes up the ""suspense"" genre of films these days.  Like other reviewers have said, be this the first or the fiftieth time that you watch this film, you will be left on the edge of your seat with its ""cat and mouse"" plot of the search for a lone assassin hired to murder President De Gaulle.  The young Edward Fox is brilliant in the title role and the supporting cast excellent.\nIf anything, this film proves that you do not need big named stars, explosions around every corner or computer generated effects to make a fantastic film.  The only downside to watching this film is that you realise that the movie industry just does not make films like this any more.\nHighly, highly recommended.";Why can't they make movies like this any more?
25;3.0;5.0;64.0;"Years before the U.S.'s controversial involvement in South Viet Nam, France struggled and eventually failed to sustain its own involvement in Algeria. Many of its senior officers felt betrayed by their government. Efforts to assassinate President De Gaulle failed. Frederick Forsyth had this in mind when writing the novel on which this film is based. At substantial cost, an assassin known only as ""The Jackal"" is retained by dissidents to succeed where others had failed. There are two separate but related plots: one focuses on the assassin's meticulous preparations; the other on Inspector Lebel's equally thorough efforts to identify, locate, and capture him. Of special interest to me is director Fred Zinnemann's decision to tell the story (as does Forsyth) in a straightforward manner, without any special effects or gratuitous violence. He presents Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) and The Jackal (Edward Fox) as highly skilled professionals. Each fully understands what he must do and how to do it. True, both receive assistance from others along the way but they nonetheless remain in complete control until their ultimate confrontation.\n\nAlthough some have referred to this film as a ""political thriller,"" there is an almost total absence of politics within its narrative. Although his client has specified Charles DeGaulle, The Jackal would kill anyone for the right price. Moreover, there is absolutely no indication of Lebel having any political loyalties or even personal opinions. He is a public official doing his job, no matter who is in danger. For some, I guess, this film is a thriller. It certainly has a number of exciting moments but I, for one, never had any doubt that Lebel would eventually prevail. My interest is explained almost entirely by the seamless development of the two plots, each of which includes several especially well-portrayed incidents. For example, when Lebel confronts a high-level minister who has unknowingly provided The Jackal with privileged information and then later, when The Jackal penetrates security defenses to position himself so that he has a clear shot at his target. ""Riveting"" rather than ""thrilling"" summarizes my response to events throughout this crisp and cohesive film.";Compelling Entertainment
27;4.0;5.0;63.0;Well, up front...I am an Edward Fox fan.  Have been since he lumbered around in the 1966 FROZEN DEAD as Nazi Popcicle #3.  Hey, he was one super fozen dead!!  He had several good roles in next few years, but really stood out as Ian McShane's fellow flyer in THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN.  They stole the show in a cast of super Brits - Lord Larry, Michael Caine, Ralph Richardson and Robert Shaw, just to name a few - firmly setting their star potential.  But Edward really carved his chunk of attention for the role as the Jackal in the 1973 DAY OF THE JACKAL.\nThe film is a tight production, nearly boarding on documentary.  Edward portrays the meticulous hitman of many disguises who has been hired to assassinate Charles de Gaulle. Based on the spy novel from Frederick Forsyth, director Fred Zinnermann focuses on the French detectives racing to track down the elusive Jackal before it's too late, and well as the dispassionate, professional preparations by Fox.  But you are in two minds, actually.  Fox is so winning in the performance, fleshing out the Jackal just not as a coldblooded killer, but as a man, so you oddly almost root for him to succeed, at the same time cheering for him to fail.\nWith the marvellous supporting cast of Derek Jacobi, Alan Badel, Maurice Denham, Cyril Cusack, the faced paced script by Kenneth Ross (Breaker Morant) keeps you absorbed from beginning to end.\nThanks awfully, Edward!!;Edward Fox is bloody brilliant!!
2;5.0;5.0;15.0;"I remember reading Frederick Forsyth's masterful thriller ""The Day of the Jackal"" way back in the 1970s, when I was still in college. Unfortunately, I never got to see the movie that was made from the book...\n\n...Until last weekend, that is, when I discovered ""The Day of the Jackal"" on Amazon Video. I quickly purchased it, adding it to my video library.\n\nThe film version of ""The Day of the Jackal"" is every bit as good as the book it's based on. The movie's plot is pretty straightforward: during the early 1960s in France, a right-wing domestic paramilitary group, opposed to French President Charles de Gaulle's policies concerning Algeria, has made several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate de Gaulle. The group's leaders decide to hire a foreign contract killer to take on the job of killing the French president. That man turns out to be a cold, ruthless, but outwardly suave man known only as ""The Jackal.""\n\nSenior ministers in the French government are made aware of the plot against de Gaulle's life. They assign their best investigator - an assistant police commissioner named Lebel - to find out if the plot is real, who is behind it, and who the assassin is that's supposed to kill the French president. The film shows the parallel courses of action taken by ""The Jackal"" (played by British character actor Edward Fox) and Commissioner Lebel (played by French actor Michael Lonsdale).\n\nAlthough there isn't a great deal of ""shoot 'em up"" action in ""The Day of the Jackal,"" the film consistently maintains a high degree of ""edge-of-your-seat"" suspense throughout its 132-minute running time. I found myself completely engrossed in the film from its opening to its closing credits. The acting is superb, the screenplay by Kenneth Ross is always taut and tense, and Fred Zinneman's direction is masterful.\n\n""The Day of the Jackal"" is a political/crime thriller at its very best. Most highly recommended.";"""The Day of the Jackal:"" a political/crime thriller at its very best."
3;6.0;1.0;18.0;"Having seen the original film and thought it brilliant, I bought the DVD version.\n\nThe original film was a full night's entertainment at the movies, and was shown in two parts with an interval between them.\n\nBut in the much abridged DVD version, many important scenes have either been left out entirely, or have been so cut as to be meaningless. For example, the scene in the hotel when the Jackal, on his way to his first meeting with the OAS conspirators, tumbles to the presence of their ""gorilla"" behind a curtin in the lobby, goes straight back out and phones them, telling them to get rid of the Gorilla immediately. Important character development: cut right out.\n\nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nI got one DVD and feel cheated. I would have preferred to pay whatever (cost to Universal < A$0.50 ) for the extra DVD and got the whole thing. I would be ashamed to play this disappointing cut down UNIVERSAL PICTURES (UK) DVD to any of my friends.\n\nCould serve as a coaster under a beer glass, perhaps.";UNIVERSAL CUT IT TO BLAZES TO FIT IT ON ONE DVD
0;7.0;5.0;27.0;"""The Day of the Jackel"" not to be confused with the inferior remake ""The Jackel"", is a marvelous character study of the coldest, coolest, most illusive and highly skilled assassin ever brought to the silver screen.  With a superior cast headed by Edward Fox, and an outstanding script, this  movie plunges the viewer in a riveting cat-and-mouse manhunt.\nNo, this  movie doesn't have explosions and car chases, but what it does have is  intelligence and suspense.

Between 1 and 10, ""The Day of the Jackel"" gets a 10.\nAs  far as the remake, ""The Jackel"", in and of itself, it isn't really a bad  film, it has just been modernized and adulterated with gadgets in lieu of a  believable script.";Just Wonderful.

The villain is Edward Fox who plays the ""The Jackal"", a hitman who is hired to kill French leader General Charles de Gaulle.  The movie shows how the Jackal goes to great lengths and uses ingenious methods in attempting to assassinate de Gaulle.  Likewise, the police authorities use intelligence and tireless detective work to track him down which builds up to a great ending.  There are so many things to like about this movie, but what also stands out for me is that all of the actors are virtually unknown to American cinema.

17;9.0;5.0;11.0;This is by far the best spy thriller I have ever seen. Not a thing is out of place here. The attention to details is just amazing. Acting is very good, plot is excellent, and directing is great. It is amazing how dedicated and professional both Lebel and the Jackal are. One is the bad guy, and the other is the good guy, and yet you cannot help but have respect for both of them. No bells and whistles here, just pure storytelling at its best.;I listened to all of them...
30;10.0;5.0;12.0;"The Day of the Jackal is a prime example of an increasingly rare breed -- a subtle, low-key action film that is actually willing to respect the intelligence of its audience.  (For evidence of how times have changed for the worse, just compare this film to its recent, star-driven remake.)  Edward Fox plays the Jackal, a coolly efficient English assassin who is hired by Algerian terrorists to assassinate French President Charles DeGaulle.  Using an almost documetary style, the film follows the Jackal as he prepares to kill DeGaulle while a French detective (Michael Lonsdale) fights against time to discover just who the Jackal actually is and stop him.  It is a sign of the story's effectiveness that, even though the majority of the audience will (hopefully) be aware that DeGaulle ended his service as France's President without being killed, the film still manages to hold the viewer's attention in a mixture of heart-pounding suspense and fascination with watching such a realistic presentation of how a political assassination might very well had been pulled off.  This isn't a short film but, clocking in at 2 and a half hours, it is never less than enthralling.\nDirector Fred Zinnemann wisely chose to eschew the trendy flashiness that was almost required of films made in the early '70s (and which has recently come back to marr so many contemporary action films) and instead emphasizes realism in both his action and his characters.  As a result, the Jackal and his pursuer never engage in the type of unbelievable acts that have become the trademarks of other action stars.  They are never more or less than recognizable human beings and that makes the film's story all the more enthralling.  Instead of filling the film with audience-pleasing pyrotechnics, Zinnemann instead uses violence so carefully and so rarely that when the action does explode on screen, it has an immediate impact.\nZinnemann was always known as a brilliant director of actors and the performances in The Day of the Jackal (from a collection of reliable English and French character actors) are flawless.  Though his character is usually overshadowed by the more charismatic Jackal, Lonsdale does a good job as the film's nominal ""hero,"" making this anonymous detective into a sort of everyman.  However, the film belongs to its title character and the actor who plays him, Edward Fox.  Fox has been typecast as stuffy, aristocratic types so it is a bit of a revelation to see his performance here.  He manages to perfectly convey the coldness of a man without a soul while, at the same time, providing glimpes of a neurotic intensity that would come from living a life that is centered totally and completely on death.  Fox creates a sympathetic screen villian without ever allowing the Jackal to become Lecterized -- the viewer never forget that this is a killer and not a warm and cuddly guy with a few eccentricities.\nThe Day of the Jackal is a film that seems to be perenially underrated.  Certainly, it runs counter to every instinct currently being displayed by the actions films coming out of Hollywood.  Which is unfortunate because the current crop of Michael Bays and Simon Wests could stand to learn quite a few lessons from Fred Zinnemann and the Day of the Jackal.";Still one of the best
19;11.0;5.0;11.0;"The coldest villain in the hottest thriller...\n\nWhen Frederick Forsyth's 'The Day Of The Jackal' first hit the shelves, it became an instant classic. It reached such popularity that a movie was but a natural consequence. Movies have never faithfully reproduced the core essence of books simply because of the minute details only a book could offer. Try showcasing The Iliad in 3 hrs!\n\nBut the movie version of The Day of the Jackal far exceeded expectations. Not only does it stick to the original plot but also even to this day, it sets the benchmark for how spy thrillers should be.\n\nIf you haven't read Forsyth's epic yet, then let me clue you in.  General Charles De Gaulle was considered a hero amongst his men when he fought for the liberation of France from the Germans in WWII. After becoming France's President, the same hero was considered a 'betrayer' after granting Algeria independence. A clandestine group in the Army, calling itself the 'Secret Army Organization' or OAS for short, launches a series of assassination attempts on De Gaulle, only to see each one destroyed by the highly informed and efficient French Secret Service. After the capture of its key lieutenants and its presiding leader, things become desperate for the OAS. It's new leader in hiding, believes that a foreign assassin of exceptional caliber is the only means left to dethrone De Gaulle. The assassin is known only by his code as ""Jackal"". This way the entire security network would be crippled for want of the man's identity. If you don't have a name, you don't have a face. If you don't have face?.... you don't exist. You are untraceable.\n\nThe premise is simple enough. It is how the Jackal plans and executes his operation that takes the bulk of the movie. The Jackal is a man of perfection and his attention to detail is something to be seen. A slight lapse in secrecy by his employers alerts France to begin searching for him, though they have no idea who or what he is. The job of finding him and 'disposing' him off in total secrecy falls into the unwilling hands of a simple French Detective. It is how these two protagonists move forward at breakneck speed in achieving their goals that takes the movie to a truly riveting, thrilling finale.\n\nEdward Fox as the Jackal is beyond doubt, the coldest, most ruthless assassin to date.  Fox is perfect for the role. His dull cowering gaze is chilling. From a staid English gentleman to a remorseless killer, Fox displays tremendous versatility and poise. Every action of his has a meaning and behind an immediate plan, he has a backup. Such is Fox's repertoire in impersonating as the Jackal. When I read the book, midway through it,  I was actually rooting for the assassin. I felt the same way when watching this movie though I knew the end. To my knowledge, very few actors have so far delivered such a convincing negative-role performance than Fox.\n\nMichael Lonsdale as the quaint Detective Lebel is probably the most ""uncharacteristic"" hero in any movie. He isn't your be-all end-all savior, with hands of steel and body of a superman. He does not fit into a mould which you can distinguish as ""Okay, I know this kind of a guy..."" and that itself is a tribute to this superb actor. He displays coolness in equal measure to the Jackal and comes across as a shy and timid man. In short, he acts as, just a detective doing his duty. His character is one of intelligence, resourcefulness and humility on one side with a quiet steely determination and resolve on the other. And Lonsdale is magnificent in displaying all of these aspects.\n\nTogether these two protagonists take an already exciting thriller to an explosive finale that is hard to imitate.\n\nThe rest of the cast add a lot of depth and meaning to their respective roles and each character has a major part in pushing forward the story to its worthy conclusion.\n\nIn short, The Day of the Jackal is a masterpiece. Considering the movies we watch today, this is slow paced, but with reason. Cheap thrillers always show you how a character dies from the bullet of an assassin but never the preparation for doing so. The Day of the Jackal shows you just how the assassin comes to that point of success. From the assassin's meticulous planning to his ultimate execution of that fatal shot, the movie shares the same perfection. Director Fred Zinnemman has set the standards for future thrillers by foregoing flashiness and instead focusing on the core issues of the book. He remains loyal to it and displays a rare cinematic flair that is very hard to beat. And do not mistake this movie to the recently released ""The Jackal"" featuring Bruce Willis and Sydney Poitier. One movie is a disappointment while the other is a classic..........\n\nWatch Fox and Lonsdale square off each other....\n\nWatch The Day of the Jackal in all its glory.........";The coldest villain in the hottest thriller...
21;12.0;5.0;11.0;"It's worth watching Michael Caton-Jones 1997 remake with Bruce Willis just  to get a measure of just how good this is, just how easy it would be to make a routine, dull, forgettable film using the essentials of this plot. Routine, dull and forgettable is exactly what Caton-Jones and Willis deliver. What Zinnemann and Edward Fox deliver is one of the very classiest thrillers there is. It's a beautifully understated film, a quiet and deceptively slow-moving cat and mouse game in which Fox's mysterious super-assassin, the Jackal, is hired by the OAS to kill General de Gaulle. As he moves in on his target the authorities and in particular French Detective Lebel struggle frantically to stop him. The latter part of the story is a brilliantly compelling police procedural where we watch the combined forces of two countries, France and Britain, plod through endless tedious chores, ploughing through thousands of passport applications in search of a single dodgy one or through all the hotel registration books in greater Paris looking for people claiming to be Danish one of whom might be their man. Meanwhile Fox is superb as the Jackal - hateful though he clearly is, at least a part of one's brain is rooting for him through much of the movie, at least until the body count of those who have got in his way starts to mount up, just because he is a single individual pitted absolutely alone against the might of two states and everything their security apparatus can thrown at him. And so the story moves on through countless beautifully conceived details, the OAS spy who seduces a top official to keep tabs on the investigation, Delphine Seyrig and Anton Rogers as the people the Jackal seduces, best of all perhaps Cyril Cusack as the assiduously comme il faut gunsmith, calmly asking Fox, ""Will the gentleman be moving?"" as if he were a tailor making a suit. Finally we arrive at a climax that should be relatively free of suspense -  we all know after all that de Gaulee in fact retired peacefully in 1969 - but is in fact one of the most brilliantly tense climaxes of any thriller I know.";Altogether Superb Thriller
36;13.0;5.0;10.0;"They really DON'T make 'em like this anymore.  Edward Fox plays ""The Jackal,"" an assassin hired by the OAS to kill Charles De Gaule.  The entire film is a wonderful game of cat and mouse between the police and the extremely intelligent killer.  What makes the Jackal so difficult to stop?  No one knows his name, his nationality, or what he looks like.  How do you begin to stop such a killer?\nEdward Fox plays the Jackal as a sophisticated, highly intelligent killer that does not make mistakes.  Watching him go through his job ""routine"" is amazing.  We feel like we are actually watching and learning his secrets of the trade.  On the other side, we see his adversary, every bit his equal:  the detective in charge of the investigation.  What makes the movie so fun to watch is the writing of these two characters.  The detective is just as good at his job as the Jackal is at his.  But will one of them make a crucial mistake, giving the advantage to the other?\n""Day of the Jackal"" has so many outstanding qualities because it was made by one of the great masters of film, Fred Zinnemann.  This was Zinnemann's first film in seven years after a long line of great films.  Many consider this his best.  Every scene is very precisely planned, yet (as many have already mentioned) each scene looks as if it belongs in a documentary.  A great story expertly handled.\nI wish the DVD had a few more extras.  Production notes are included, but audio commentary by Fox would have been a great addition.  Also a film of this length (nearly 2 and 1/2 hours) should probably have more chapter divisions, having only about 14 or 15 as I remember.  Still, these minor points can't bring down such a great suspense classic.";An Espionage Masterpiece
5;14.0;5.0;6.0;"""The Day of the Jackal"" (1973) is a parallel procedural in which we follow an assassin and his police pursuers through all sorts of moves and counter-moves. President Charles De Gaulle gave independence to Algeria from France, and a group of retired army officers (the OAS) vowed to kill him. After a failed attack on his limousine, the plotters hire a British contract killer, a superb marksman, code named Jackal, brilliantly played by Edward Fox. He is a meticulous and clever planner, a tactician, who hires a forger to fake documents and an armorer to design a special sniper rifle that can be assembled from small sections and easily concealed. (Watch for what Fox does to a watermelon.) All the steps of his preparation for his assassination are documented, using guile and disguises, and along the way he has to dispatch people who get in his way.\n The French investigation unit led by the unassuming but sharp-witted plodder Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) enlist the aid of Scotland Yard to track down the identity of the Jackal. Lebel's assistant is Caron (Derek Jacobi) who resembles Fox. Suspense is built up as the Jackal barely manages to stay one step ahead of the cops. He's a flashy dresser and sports an ascot. There's a James Bond quality to him.\n It's a movie that engrosses the viewer, with a clever, complex plot, well acted, and beautifully photographed with great shots of European sites. The preparations and parading on French Liberation Day around the Arch of Triumph intensify the suspense build-up.";Falling Prey to the Jackal

Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of the Frederick Forsythe thriller is compulsive viewing for fans of political thrillers, espionage and deadly assassins.

Then by all means check out THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, an intriguing film made over 30 years ago, based on Frederick Forsyth's exceptional novel of the same name.\nA plot has been hatched to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle; a professional killer with icewater in his veins known as ""The Jackal"" (Edward Fox) is hired.  The French authorities learn of the plan and dispatch their best investigator, Inspector Lebel (Michel Lonsdale), to capture the Jackal and prevent the assassination.  The movie subsequently follows the two characters--one as he implements his fascinating plan through disguise and deceit, the other as he races against the clock on a relentless manhunt--until their paths cross in a thrilling and riveting conclusion.\nFox and Lonsdale are wonderful.  As the Jackal, Fox makes this cold and calculating killer absolutely believable, while Lonsdale lends a comic vulnerability to his role as the often-frazzled inspector.  And director Fred Zinnemann knows exactly when to zip the lines of the actors and let the camera tell the story; in fact, a significant portion of this film is presented in golden silence.

4;18.0;5.0;5.0;Thoroughly compelling thriller. Shot on location across Europe. Further evidence that movies can (or at least, could) be entertaining without CGI, blatant cursing, and explicit sex.\n\nEdward Fox is suave as The Jackal. In my opinion, the best proof of his total dedication to the job is his willingness to sleep with both men and women to attain entry or elude authorities. Michael Lonsdale as the detective is just as good as the overworked and underappreciated detective. It's frustrating that these two excellent actors did relatively few mainstream American films. Eagle-eye viewers might notice a young(er) Edward Hardwicke at the end. Doesn't quite look like Dr. Watson without the mustache!\n\nThis is not a critique of the film, but this DVD is over 10 years old. That's an eternity in media nowadays. Both main actors are still alive (and indeed, active) so perhaps one or both could be enticed to provide commentary for a new release?;Forget 1997's The Jackal. This is the one to see!
10;19.0;5.0;6.0;Someone in the above reviews quipped, 'why don't they make movies like this anymore?' Good question. I guess because they're (today's producers) money driven and willing to pander to the more base instincts of youthful moviegoers in order to achieve just one more week at the box office.\n\nThis is one of the best movies ever made. It is plot driven, closely sticking to the Forsyth book, and although it's about the French which probably wouldn't get as much play today, it soon gets you to the edge of your seat and rivets you there.\n\nDeGaulle for many reasons but especially for his politics in Algiers, has numerous attempts on his life. Remeber that in those post World War times, support of the Army was critical. The role of the Army in America probably came to an end in terms of its influential power when President Truman spanked General MacArthur in front of the entire class. In the real world, DeGaulle was an odd fellow, somewaht heroic, somewhat of an isolationist. The OAS, the French Army terrorist cell hires Edward Fox (who looks strangely like David Bowie, doesn't he?) as the suave, well dressed, cold blooded killer to assassinate DeGaulle.\n\nPolice procedural, scenic, Fox staying ahead of the police step by step, murder, rapid but contiguous scene changes. Just great stuff with great acting by then unknowns, several of whom didn't act again.\n\nHighly recommended. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury;Kind of makes the remake look like a high school project

38;23.0;5.0;7.0;"This is one of the very few films I couldn't pick out any flaws in! Completely riveting from start to finish. Extremely well acted by everyone, especially Michael Lonsdale (whom you might recognize as the villain Drax in ""Moonraker""), and Edward Fox. Attention is paid to detail, and there is never anything that happens that struck me as contrived or unbelievable. Zinnemann took a slight risk by using little or no dialogue in some scenes, and having such a quick, abrupt ending, but these things work to the film's benefit. The entire movie is a tension filled story of how the Jackal prepares for his last, biggest, career-ending hit; the cops' ingenious methods of tracking him; and his equally ingenious ways of eluding them.  Fox studied hard for this role, and it pays off for the viewer:  he perfectly portrays the Jackal as an utterly uncaring, egocentric, extremely elusive and clever individual, as a person with this occupation would probably be. Lonsdale is just as fantastic; his character is always completely believable as a man who is continually stunned by the Jackal's elusiveness, yet he never gives up and doesn't show over- or underconfidence. I give this film 5 stars because it's not only flawless, but still rewards attentiveness after all these years. Magnificent performances like these never date.";Galvanizing
18;24.0;4.0;6.0;So often it seems movies based on novels rarely live up to the expectations of those who've actually read the book, causing consternation and generally a slew of negative reviews involving commentary about how scenes are missing, subtleties not translating, and characters either marginalized or even removed.  Well, that doesn't seem to be the case with The Day of the Jackal (1973), based on the bestseller written by Frederick Forsyth.  Now keep in mind, I haven't read the book, so I gathered this by reading other reviews.  Also, given the film is almost 2  hours long, I would think the story presented to be fairly inclusive with regards to the book.\n\nThe film is directed by Fred Zinnemann, whose other credits include High Noon (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), Oklahoma! (1955) and A Man for All Seasons (1966), to name a few.  Starring in the movie is Edward Fox (The Duellists, Force 10 from Navarone) and Terrence Alexander (The Vault of Horror).  By the way, am I the only one who thinks Alexander looks remarkably similar to the main bad guy in Moonraker (1979)?  I checked, and it's not...that character, named Higo Drax, and was played by Michael Lonsdale.  Also appearing is, well, a slew of mostly European actors I won't bother listing, not because they're not noteworthy, but there was just so dang many of them.  If you're really curious, you can look it up (What?  You expect me to do everything?)\n\nThe movie, described as a quasi-documentary, takes place in the early 60's, about the time the premier frog in chief President Gen. Charles De Gaulle relinquished France's control of Algeria to back its' native occupants.  This upset quite a few Frenchies, especially those who were either serving or were retired from the military at the time reasoning being that the war over that particular country was hard and costly, and now, the country that forced them to go fight is now ready to give it up, basically nullifying all the effort and sacrifices put forth to secure Algeria.  Some were so upset they formed a group called OAS, an underground resistance group whose sole intention seemed to be the assassination of De Gaulle for his perceived treasonous actions.  After about five failed attempts on De Gaulle's life (only one of which we actually get to see), the group decides it's time to bring in an outsider, as they seem to blame their failures on leaks and moles within their own group (the fact they were a bunch of lame duck, grabasstic, knuckleheads had nothing to do with it, I'm sure).  Based on their research, they finally narrow the field to one, highly experienced, foreign individual, code named The Jackal (I'd love to see his resume).  The Jackal's (Fox) demands are few, but very specific, and his price is high, as his reasoning is that this type of job is a career ender, based on the level of importance of the target.  The OAS agrees to the Jackal's terms, and thus begins his long and meticulous process of developing false identities, procuring a suitable weapon, and researching suitable locations where he may have access to his target.  The French authorities get wind of a new scheme by the OAS, but little else as the shroud of secrecy around the Jackal is very thick.  Given the difficulty of obtaining information through their regular channels, the French authorities put their best detective on the case (no, not Inspector Jacques Clouseau), played by Alexander.  His resources are nearly unlimited, but he must keep a tight lid on things as not to tip off the OAS and the Jackal what little information they have, which severely hamstrings the investigation.  Now it comes down to a race between a deadly, meticulous, calculating assassin intent on taking out his target and a smart, intuitive detective intent on stopping him.\n\nI really enjoyed this lengthy film.  Zinnemann does a wonderful job showing both sides of the story, that of the assassin, and that of the authorities intent on stopping him, the two stories slowly converging to create a climatic conclusion.  The pacing may seem slow to some, but it serves well to examine many fine details regarding both the Jackal's preparations and planning, and also the French gooberment's exhaustive investigation which involves a number of gooberment agencies from different countries as the Jackal is a tricky sort, taking great, meticulous care to cover his tracks and keeping his identity hidden.  Also, it's worth the payoff as the last 20 or 30 minutes are really worth waiting for...I really liked how the Jackal was able to keep a few steps ahead of the authorities (with a little help), anticipating danger and making the appropriate compensating actions.  Along the way he had to dispose of certain elements (people), but it was only done as measured against perceived threats to his ultimate goal...he may be a cold, methodical murderer, but he's a professional cold, methodical murderer.  I also really liked the thoroughness of the investigation, based on tedious, deductive, involved work and not on conjecture pulled from someone's behind.  The detective work was presented as thorough, comprehensive, and intelligent.  Casting Edward Fox as the Jackal was really inspired (Michael Caine wanted the role), maintaining a sense of anonymity over the character, allowing for the focus to be more on the story rather than the celebrity status of an actor playing the character.  The use of locations, mostly in France, but also in England, Austria, and Italy, was wonderful, and added so much flavor and credibility to the story.  I love seeing places I've never been (but may like to go someday, but just to visit, not assassinate anyone).\n\nThe DVD offers a pretty good wide screen picture (1:85:1) and decent audio.  Special features include detailed production notes and a theatrical trailer.  All in all, a great adaptation, and a great film.  Avoid the 1997 remake with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere...I wish I had...\n\nCookieman108;My high school aptitude tests pointed towards assassin...

I watched this film several times but all were not from the start. Eventually I have my frend to buy it from UK and sent it to me. I love this film because the detective the method used was so simple but effective. Further, this is very interesting to imagine the days when it was no internet, no (cheap, fast and powerful) computers to help the police. The police force just depended on their logical thinking and, of course, luck to find the Jackle. I still cannot say precisely why I love this film so much, maybe it recalls the days when our world was not so complicated. Anyway, it is a good film and worth to buy it.";Good Film!
39;26.0;2.0;7.0;There is a patince to the proceedongs of The Day of The Jackal that is wonderfful to watch. The film, like it should, starts slowly and build on layers of plot to an exciting trans-continental chase. Today most thrillers  would go for a cheap quick thrill like getting a character shot in the face  or having a limb blown off, but Zimmerman wisely avoids this preffering to  build on Phycological suspense. Alas, despite these qualites, the film has  dated terribly. All the charcters, regardless of nationality speak the same  language, and while I don't particularly care for realism in movies, I felt  it to be essential here. The acting is universally stiff and one sided. It  is understandable that Edward Fox should be constantly smiling, a sign of  villany in all modern films, but unlike say, the opening scenes of The  Crying Game there is no human intensity to the proceedings. Its all  calculated and cold. I understand why this film recieved raves on release,  but sadly it just doesn't measure up today. Having said that, I would  rather watch this film ten times in a row, with eyelids taped open  Clockwork Orange style than see ten minutes of the truly miserable Micheal  Caton Jones remake The Jackal.;Badly Dated
6;27.0;3.0;5.0;This is a great movie... From the opening newsreel type shots of France and Algiers to the dual stories of the planning of the assassination attempt and the attempt to thwart it, this film delivers a thrilling exxperience. Too bad that it wasn't formatted anamorphically to be shown on a widescreen TV.... as it is, you must watch it in 4:3 aspect mode to see it as it was meant to be seen. For this reason I would recommend that anyone interested in seeing this movie, rent it instead of purchasing the DVD. I hope that someone re-releases this DVD in an anamorphic format at some point in the near future.;Great Movie... too bad...
29;28.0;5.0;6.0;"This superlative movie has all the classic ingredients of a real thriller, without all the non-stop action, sex and explosions which typifies today's examples of this genre. The Jackal provides a classy alternative.  The OAS were a group of rogue French Foreign Legioniers and other dissident military elements who were resentful of De Gaulle's pull-out from Algeria.  We must recall that Algeria was the spiritual home of the Legion since its formation in 1831.  Algeria was considered a part of metropolitan France, and held a status much higher than any other French colony.  Coming on the heels of France's recent defeats in Indo-china the thought of losing Algeria as well to Moslem-Communist infleuences was unacceptable to many in the French military.\nThe OAS conducted many assassinations both inside Algeria and France itself.  There were certainly many attempts to assassinate De Gaulle and it must be said that he had something of a charmed life.  It is known that the OAS contracted a British assassin from within the Legion most likely who was code named ""Jackal"".  He was given the paltry sum of 40,000 to make an assassination attempt on the French President.  It is not known for sure whether he made any attempts or not.  The book, upon which the movie is based takes the plot a step further and portrays a British assassin who is probably a lot more determined and competent than his historical counterpart was.  While fact is often mixed with fiction here, the way this movie does it is not as irksome as many films do it today.  The Jackal is believeable, and because we don't know for sure how far such attempts were made to get De Gaulle the plot tries to fill in the historical gaps.\nFrance had recently gone through many turbulent years with recent humiliations from Nazi defeat in 1940, to Vichy colloboration, and to the loss of her colonies after the war which saw France reduced from premier status in the world.  Such violent changes are bound to leave their conflicting marks on the politics of any nation.  It is not surprising then that many in the French military wanted to reverse a series of steady defeats since 1940.  Holding on to Algeria at all costs seemed the only way to do this.  While the film does not go into the background politics which sets up the Jackal's scenario too much, we learn enough from the beginning of the movie to know why he has been hired to assassinate De Gaulle.  Would the world have been a worse place had the OAS and Jackal succeeded?  It's hard to say.  Despite what some French might say, De Gaulle was really not a major player in the developing Cold War, nor was France a pivital nation in Euroepan politics anymore either.  His death would certainly have hurt France's image even more, but its not likely it would have changed world politics that much.  So in the end what we have with The Jackal is some classic suspence, good acting by all the players, and a story that does not dumb itself down like so many action thrillers today do.  Jackal can be enjoyed without having to wince from excessive gore or violence.  It also depicts a period in recent history which was quite unstable for France.  Enjoy this movie, as they don't make them like this much anymore.  The DVD version seems to have a clear print and has some interesting production notes as well.";Jackal On Target!
7;29.0;5.0;5.0;"The Day of the Jackal is one of the best action-suspense films ever made!  It's nothing short of brilliant and it's something of a hidden treasure.  Movie buffs know the movie but, sadly, it doesn't get the sort of mainstream recognition of even a mediocre thriller like The Fugitive for instance.\n\nWhat's fantastic about Jackal is that it works within the realm of possibility.  The Jackal, a British contract killer hired by the OAS to assassinate Charles De Gaulle, is cunning, effective, sharp, but human; not the near super-human killers of movies of the last 20 or so years.\n\nThe drama builds and never relents.  This is an extraordinary feat considering that the assassin's target is a real historical figure who was never assassinated.\n\nAll the main characters were terrifically portrayed.  If there is a shortfall, it is that the French characters have British accents.  This detracted a bit from the realism.  It's a minor criticism, one that is all but swallowed by the strengths of the movie.\n\nThis is a must see.  Even if you're not a fan of the so-called ""spy fiction"" genre, you'll enjoy the intrigue, suspense or, in the least, all the wonderful shots of Italy and France.";A true classic.  One of the best of its kind.

A shrewd, high-ranking  French detective is brought in on the case as are the full crime-detection resources of the British and U.S. Governments once 10 Downing Street is alerted to the fact that The Jackal may be an Englishman!

33;32.0;5.0;6.0;This movie has some excellent acting, a wonderfully tight plot, and some brilliant casting, superb direction... I could go on.\nThe movie is an assasination plot. Sure, we've seen so many of these in today's age. But this one is different. It is a serious plot, and is truly brilliant in its casting and direction. The expression of Lebel as he realises that he has to work round the clock, the expressions of anxiety, pressure, tiredness, excitement... and the pace of the movie keeps one riveted to the seat even if one knows the entire story beforehand by reading the book.\nThe film's strongest character is Fox, who plays the assassin. Cool, calm and collected, he is focused and decisive. He is ruthless and charming. He is cunning and meticulous. Fox has a toothy smile and his perfectly combed hair and his perfect attire make him the consummate Englishman. A lot of this films' directorial style and screenplay seems to have inspired another classic - The Fourth Protocol, where the whole Cat-and-mouse game is replayed. Fox plays the perfect professional killer - cold, methodical, planned and unremorsefully and ruthlessly committed to his goal.\nThe Day of the Jackal is a silent and terse film. The screenplay and the direction seem to show the same sense of urgency and focus within the plot, that the characters display in their own objectives.\nIf one has a collection of movies at home, this is one movie that demands its place. Definitely a treasure.;A true classic

22;36.0;4.0;5.0;First of all, this film has no relation to the recent film titled 'The Jackal' starring Bruce Willis which is complete fiction and bad fiction at that.\n\nFred Zinnemann directed this 1973 film based on actual events involving the attempted assassination of French President Charles de Gaulle by the OAS in the 1960s.  A great suspense thriller where the audience is gripped by both the elusive assassin's stealth as well as the chief inspector's tenacity.\n\nThe film follows the real political events in France in the early 60s at the close of the Algerian War of Independence.  Faced with public outcry to end the war, President Charles DeGaulle seeks peace with the North African rogue colony of Algeria.  Ardently opposed to DeGaulle are many top military officers who've formed a an organization named the OAS (acronym for Secret Army Organization.)  The OAS prepared a coup to remove him from power: by assassination if necessary.  The conspirators enter into a contract with an elusive assassin known only as 'The Jackal'(Edward Fox) who will stop at nothing to get the job done.  Although French authorities are aware of the plot, they're equally ignorant as to the identity of the hired killer.  The task of finding the assassin in time falls upon an officer of the Surete (Michael Lonsdale: Drax in Moonraker) who's determined to protect the president.\n\nThe film is fast paced and brings the audience into the cat-and-mouse game almost immediately.  The film follows both the assassin and his pursuer until the climactic ending.  The film quality is good for its time and the audience is kept in suspense as to the assassin's methods and plans.  The gripping screenplay is brought to life by the great acting talents of the actors as well as a competent director.\n\nAltogether a great political suspense thriller that is all the more convincing because its mostly true.  A great film to own or watch numerous times.;How To Stop A Stealthy  And Anonymous Assassin
23;37.0;1.0;5.0;"Not much to add to earlier comments, except this: if you're looking for that truly dreadful Bruce Willis disaster of a so-called 'remake', and were directed instead to this original 'Jackal' by mistake, then go no further.  You don't know how lucky you are to have missed the pure dreck of the remake -- rather, you've found your way to another masterpiece from the director who gave us ""High Noon"", and much more.  Think of it as having embarked on a snipe-hunt for junkyard trinkets but happily stumbling onto a real gem.  The DVD print is excellent, right down to conveying the subtley bleached effect that I recall from the original release, and the classic ""look"" and texture of the old Schneider Panavision lenses and European lighting -- all effects that heighten the movie's authenticity and mid-60's ambience.  This classic is a far cry from the phony, who-are-you-kidding cinematic comic books of today that try to emulate computer games for overgrown adolescents.  The writing, directing and acting are lean and direct, the visual style is spare, efficient, exceptionally effective.  When you consider that this is a well researched, fairly accurate telling of actual people and events, you have one of those rare movies that, like ""The Third Man"", seriously upped the stakes for the espionage/suspense genre, raising the bar to heights that its imitators can't even hope to reach.\nSad to say, even if the image is 1.85:1 aspect, it's letterboxed in a 4:3 image that blurs all to hell if you try to blow it up on an HD screen, indicating it's a cheap low-bitrate transfer on single-layer disc.

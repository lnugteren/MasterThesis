0;64;36;0.9090754829814209;gettysburg is an excellent film it is well acted with excellent cinematography and outstanding realistic pacing i wo n t get in depth with the story as that has already been done but here are a few things any prospective viewer may want to know n first the source material the movie is based on the award winning and excellent book the killer angels by michael shaara incidentally his son jeff has been writing war novels to follow in his dad s footsteps for years now the movie follows the novel closely and for historically nitpickers that is n t always a good thing the most glaring example is the usage of joshua chamberlain as the unsung hero of gettysburg as any true student of the civil war should know the events involving chamberlain on little round top in the book and the film are based on chamberlain s own version of the events chamberlain was a notorious self promoter after the war and not a single man in his old command backed up his version of events quite a few outright disputed chamberlain s version for example some insisted that chamberlain s brilliant bayonett charge never happened not that the charge did n t happen just that chamberlain had nothing to do with it they stated that the charge happened spontaniously a common occurence in the warfare of that era and was not the result of any plan or order from chamberlain chamberlain simply saw an opportunity to grab glory for himself by claiming credit for the charge any in depth investigation into the man will reveal his true personal character was hardly the shining hero atop little round top that he wished to convey taking personal credit for the spontanious actions of an entire regiment is not even ethical much less heroic michael shaara apparently bought chamberlain s version of events hook line and sinker sadly shaara s book had such an impact on the public consciousness that many believe that the version of chamberlain depicted in the book is based on real historical fact when really it is at best extremely dubious storytelling having said that shaara s book is still very close to the actual events that happened there is a little creative license to create drama but for the most part it accurated depicts what happened during those three july days of 1863 n one other minor grievance i had with the film was the battle scenes while very authentic looking the scenes still suffered from something that most war films suffer from a lack of combatants the assault on little round top on the second day involved many thousands of confederate soldiers yet the scenes of this assault only show about 20 30 rebels at any one time even a skirmish would involve more men assaulting the 20th maine than that obviously the budget constraints and shortage of reenactors are to blame and so can be forgiven just be aware that all the assaults were much grander in scope than what you are seeing onscreen including the third day s charge incorrectly labelled pickett s charge by history n of course both of these grievances are very minor points and do not subtract from the power and drama of the film notice i still gave it 5 stars the cast has a lot to do with why this movie is so powerful an excellent job is done by virtually the whole cast with jeff daniels standing out in particular ironically enough daniels portrays joshua chamberlain daniels scene when he learns of a comrade s death is the most poignant in the entire movie and reminds us that the glory of battle comes with a terrible price indeed on a slightly more sour note c thomas howell does a barely adequate job a better actor should have been chosen to portray chamberlain s younger brother tom and thank god ted turner only has a cameo his acting is atrocious n the location scenery is both historically accurate or close enough and beautifully utilized and the battle choregraphy is quite good considering the limited budget and largely volunteer cast of extras n overall gettysburg is the absolute best civil war movie ever made it is very powerful and if you you have any interest in one of the most important events in america s history i encourage you to watch this movie highest possible reccomendation n as a side note a follow up movie gods generals was made sadly it does not live up to the expectations set by gettysburg feel free to check out my review of gods generals
1;50;24;0.901170895321778;this is a nice transfer of novel to screen michael shaara s work is well known to those interested in the civil war it used an interesting technique selecting several characters and reporting their observations of events and their perspectives and understanding of those among the key characters from whose eyes we see things include robert e lee james longstreet joshua lawrence chamberlain winfield scott hancock and from the first day john buford this is a long movie over 4 hours but to encapsulate as sprawling a battle as gettysburg this is altogether appropriate n nwhat of the cast overall awfully good for a movie that is far from a traditional theater release martin sheen plays robert e lee i m not sure that he s as wooden as some reviewers comment but his it s all in god s hands now does become a bit stale by the end jeff daniels is quite affecting as chamberlain he has an appropriate academic air and portrays an amateur s sense of warfare sam elliott as the hard bitten crusty buford is almost perfectly cast tom berenger does a nice job portraying longstreet s discomfort with strategy and tactics and a foreboding of the battle s outcome secondary characters are played well too such as stephen lang s george picket richard jordan s lew armistead and kevin conway s sergeant kilrain all in all the acting is quite well done n nthe scope of the movie it begins with the hours before the meeting engagement at gettysburg this was an accidental battle with neither side anticipating a great fight there among the scenes is a delightful meeting among armistead pickett and longstreet in which a pleasantly diverting discussion of charles darwin takes place n nthe first day featured the confrontation between harry heth s division and buford s cavalry as the pressure begins to be too much general john reynolds at the head of the fearsome fighter of the first corps arrives at this point the movie gets a but fuzzy historically one gets the sense that the line starts collapsing at one place as the iron brigade arrives at another under the direct command of reynolds this is misleading the forces to the immediate north of the iron brigade did not collapse until after reynolds placement of the fighting westerners and his death the day ends with a powerful meeting between buford and the union generals gathering at gettysburg n non the second day the key action in the movie includes devil s den and little round top on that day much more happened including desperate fighting on cemetery ridge and culp s hill not depicted in this movie but the movie is already long at 4 hours so this is merely a minor quibble the dvd accepts pretty much without question chamberlain s rather self serving version of the 20th maine s stalwart fight protecting the left flank of the union army nonetheless this is a powerful scene and works most nicely n nthe third day the focus is pickett s charge technically a misnomer since other divisions were involved as well pettigrew and trimble commanded troops as well the tension of the day is well portrayed e porter alexander directed a massive cannonade to try to wreak havoc on the union center at the close of the barrage the 12 000 15 000 confederate troops are shown beginning their doomed charge the music swells in a most affecting scene and then the carnage begins with union artillery and later rifled musket fire decimating the attackers n nmuch poignancy in this third day the personal courage of hancock which appears to be historically accurate the brave last stand by armistead also correct the effort by lee to inspire his troops after the repulse and so on n nthere are some historical glitches here the movie misses many dramatic moments although how could it be otherwise with the time limitations of a movie format on the whole however this is a powerful version of the critical battle at gettysburg well worth watching
2;58;109;0.8867072154635818;not until i watched gettysburg on tnt the first time was i even interested in the civil war after seeing this epic on television i immediately ran out and purchased the video soon after that i began reading just about every book i could find on the battle and discovered that the filmakers did their homework on this one what makes this film so realistic is that they shot on the actual battlefield or close by in many cases and used re enactors for many of the battle scenes not just a group of extras dressed up for the parts although martin sheen overworks his characterization of general robert e lee the others do an excellent job you actually find yourself feeling general pickett and general longstreet s played by tom berringer pain and frustration when the battle begins to go against the south the only thing i did n t like about the movie was when ted turner the tnt mogal placed himself in the movie as one of the leaders of the virginia contingent and dies very badly when his time comes other than that you become mesmorized by the strategy that both armies worked to win this campaign and the actual battle footage is so realistic you wonder if any of the re enactor soldiers playing in the movie did n t get hurt there s one scene where a cannon shot goes off right in front of a group and blows them back in to the ranks even my young sons have watched this 2 or 3 times with me and has got them to ask questions about the war if a movie can do that to kids that are usually more interested in the lasted fad these days then this is a keeper you ll find that even the least informed history fans will discover that this movie has a plot line that is easy to follow and will keep your interest throughout the length of the film also get your hands on the soundtrack as its quite enjoyable to listen to
3;68;21;0.8725583372328117;this movie is based on the book the killer angels which is an awesome work of art pulitzer prize winning novel i highly recommend reading the book thoroughly before attempting to watch this movie the book is flat out phenomenal the movie on the other hand was disappointing for me i ll try to explain why i thought so first of all the acting in this movie is not the best work done by the actors that appear in the movie most of whom have impressive resumes the way martin sheen portrays robert e lee makes one wonder how this general could have achieved such a lofty reputation i think sheen was off base in his effort here tom berenger however plays a great general longstreet the fake beards in the movie are terrible and hard to over look as you re watching it and trying to follow this gripping story you almost ca n t stop yourself from laughing at the makeup the movie itself is very long around 4 hours and you have to flip the dvd over after viewing the first half which in itself is not a problem but i would think that the director could include more important scenes in a movie of that length than some of the scenes left in for example i would have liked the movie to explore the interaction between lee and longstreet after the battle which the book does some this movie is hard to follow if you have n t read the book and already have an idea where the story is going the movie jumps around and it is easy for the first time viewer to get lost and not understand where the movie is going as it bounces around from one side of the battle to the other and from one character to another the movie makers did n t do a good enough job transitioning from scene to scene to keep the audience clued in to what was happening and why a particular chain of events was important to the story and the outcome if you are a true civil war buff i definitely think you should watch the movie but do n t expect a masterpiece or a great piece of work movies are never as good as the books they are based upon it seems that the acting in this movie is wooden with the actors reading from pages of script as if hurried along to get finished the way the scenes were shot gives the movie an artificial feel as if they are on a stage with a bunch of props and as a result the movie does n t feel realistic it seems as though you are watching a re enactment instead of actual events other war movies escape this trap and make the audience feel they are watching the actual event in summary i m glad i watched it but i thought it could have been better this movie is average at best
4;67;20;0.8606208364375364;being an active professor a war film collector and a twenty five year military veteran i sometimes tend to be overly critical of war films mostly in terms of historical accuracy and situational believability the pains the producers took make this both an enjoyable film yet as historically accurate as they could are especially noteworthy n nnumerous other reviewers have accomplished excellent detailed descriptions of the unfolding events that evolved into the battle of gettysburg as described in the film so i will limit my comments to those that i believe will focus on overall quality n nthe film accurately presents the evolution of events that slowly build into one of history s most important battles one that neither side really wanted to fight on this site despite the fact that it proved to be good ground for such a massive engagement one aspect of this crescendo approach that i most appreciated was the presentation of many views of the characters and personalities of the military figures from both sides of the conflict n none of the most important revelations was the fact that general robert e lee was not the strategically infallible figure that many historians portray and that certain decisions he made despite the opposition of his excellent corps and division commanders ultimately turned the battle in the union s favor the film also subtly presented the effect on the battle s strategy and outcome of the untimely death of general thomas stonewall jackson as presented in gods and generals n nwhen i first saw the listings on the cast of this film i was taken aback since i had mentally stereotyped some actors in previous roles that would not seem to be a fit for their roles in this film however martin sheen did a fine job as robert e lee tom berenger was superb as general longstreet stephen lang excelled as general pickett and so on the greatest surprise was the performance of jeff daniels as colonel joshua lawrence chamberlain whose performance is followed here and further expanded upon in gods and generals gettysburg s prequel this film and his performance in the crossing clearly showed what a fine and versatile actor daniels is n nit would be redundant to describe some of the most fantastic battle scenes ever filmed as this has been well covered by other reviewers utterly fantastic about covers it in terms of realism and a spare no expense attitude on the parts of the producers who desired historical accuracy in the making of the film n ni seriously can not imagine any collector who would not place this film near the top of most valued films of all time simply priceless especially in terms of emphasizing the always elusive human side of war films
5;94;46;0.8586544822048098;gettysburg is an excellent movie revolving around the civil war battle of gettysburg i felt this movie was unique in the fact it showed the strategy and the logistics of the battle rather than showing the blood horror and dismemberment that i would expect from a movie based on the bloodiest battle of the civil war the movie starts on june 30 1863 the day before the battle at gettysburg begins the movie mainly revolves around the involvement of two groups the 20th maine regiment commanded by col chamberlain played by jeff daniels and the confederate army of northern virginia commanded by gen lee played by martin sheen n nthe movie does show its share of blood however i thought the movie did a brilliant job depicting the logistics of the battle and what happened behind the scenes of the battle the movie showed the people behind the war not just the war itself for instance the movie portrayed some of the reasons gen lee led the confederate army to battle at this particular place and the reservations some of the generals under gen lee had with fighting the north at gettysburg it also showed col chamberlain dealing with problems unrelated to the battle such as taking in over 100 northern soldiers who refused to fight after their unit was disbanded i do not know enough about the history of the battle of gettysburg to say whether the contents of this movie is factual or not n nat over 4 hours this movie is slightly on the slow side if your idea of a great war movie is hamburger hill or rambo this movie is definitely not for you if you are interested in the people behind war and the decisions they make this movie is definitely worth watching
6;16;19;0.8533525796521775;unfortunately amazon explains little or nothing about the new gettysburg director s cut blu ray release what exactly does director s cut mean here these are the timings for the original theatrical release the two previous digital releases and the new blu ray release as listed at another site n ngettysburg original theatrical release running time 3 hrs 58 minutes plus a 20 minute intermission ngettysburg laserdisc running time 4 hrs 29 min ngettysburg dvd running time 4 hrs 14 minutes ngettysburg blu ray 2011 director s cut running time 4 hrs 31 minutes n nsince the 17 minute difference between the dvd and the upcoming blu ray release is almost exactly the same as the difference with the laserdisc release i can only assume that the added 17 minutes will be the same as that found on the laserdisc this included one crucial scene that for some absurd reason was included in neither the theatrical release nor the dvd release in it following the first day s conflict lee meets with his generals who were responsible for leading the first day s battles and gets an admission from them that they failed to take the crucial cemetery hill if not the entire missionary ridge heights when they were supposedly open for the taking thus we come to know from this scene that generals like early and ewell were actually at gettysburg along with longstreet and pickett and that that was the reason why lee ordered pickett to charge the ridge on the third day also included in the laserdisc was a scene when union cavalry general buford enters gettysburg on the first day before moving thru the town and engaging lee s advance division west of town he is met by several townspeople including an officious mayor of the town who demands protection to my recollection i gave up my laserdisc version several years ago when my player self destructed this about takes up most if not all of the 17 additional minutes the rest of the dvd release seemed to match the laserdisc release fully n nleaving aside the inaccuracies and omissions some historians for example hold that ewell probably could n t have taken cemetery hill that first day whether he d actually tried or not since by late afternoon his advancing forces had become bogged down for a considerable time in chasing the union forces through gettysburg itself and there was already at least a fresh division of union troops on the summit facing the town and a great deal of the 2nd day fighting including general sickles and the wheatfield are completely neglected while meade hardly appears at all the movie especially in its depiction of the little round top battle on the 2nd day along with the two day argument that arose between longstreet and lee re the efficacy of continuing to fight the battle at gettysburg is highly vivid and accurate randy edelman s music is also exceptional while jeff daniel s depiction of joshua chamberlain stephen lang s of pickett and tom berenger s of longstreet are especially outstanding while casting martin sheen as the courtly lee was controversial i for one found his performance also excellent the other great stars of the movie of course are the re enactors along with the battery of cannons that so vividly mark the prelude to pickett s charge in both dts sound and blu ray the battle scenes especially should reach an ultimate level of excitement highly looked forward to n n note just a measure of what s happened to movie digital release prices in the past 25 years or so i purchased the laserdisc version of the movie at 179 95 retail in orlando florida sometime in the mid 1990 s
7;35;107;0.8443599098504806;an absolutely magnificent historically accurate description of the the pivotal battle of the 19th and ultimately the 20th century yeah i know some would say it s purely nationalistic hubris to describe an 1863 battle in north america as the pivotal battle of two centuries but that s how the mop flops on gettysburg s outcome depended the future of the united or dis united states its outcome decided whether one nation the us or two the us and the csa would determine the course of the next century had the north lost great britain and france and perhaps germany would have won i m no ted turner fan but my hat s off to him in this instance much pressure was put upon him to shorten the movie and he nobly resisted result a masterpiece which ranks with the ten commandments or the greatest story ever told in this enlightened aka cynical era when it s difficult to imagine laying down one s life for an idea this faithful depiction of the realities of combat which only those who ve heard a shot fired in anger can truly appreciate is much needed none piece of advice demand the director s cut in a dvd release there s a lot of excellent supplementary information in it that s missing from the truncated early edition settle only for the best also read the killer angels
8;47;39;0.8374899399269169;based on late author michael shaara s pulitzer prize winning civil war novel the killer angels gettysburg brings the bloodiest battle ever fought on american soil to life on the screen in one of the most moving epic films ever made the movie covers the brutal three day conflict fought at gettysburg pennsylvania from july 1st through july 3rd 1863 mainly through the experiences of three incredible men confederate general robert e lee martin sheen confederate lieutenant general james longstreet tom berenger and union colonel joshua l chamberlain jeff daniels through these men and others gettysburg tells the story of this decisive engagement of the civil war perfectly n nthe whole cast s performances are stellar throughout the entire movie jeff daniels portrayal of the professor turned soldier colonel chamberlain stands out as one of the best performances in the film along with tom berenger s excellent general longstreet and though martin sheen may not completely capture the physical characteristics of general lee he certainly captures his spirit the minor roles are also incredibly well done from stephen lang s confederate general george pickett to kevin conway s union sergeant buster kilrain each actor s similarities and historical accuracy minded devotion to his character gives the film an incredible authenticity n none of the many things that sets gettysburg apart from so many other war movies is its amazing attention to historical accuracy not only was the movie filmed entirely on the actual battlefield locations in pennsylvania but the film also benefits hugely from how historically correct the uniforms weapons and sets are its use of over 4 000 civil war reenactors makes its epic battles far more realistic powerful and moving than any movie could ever accomplish using computerization n nevery one of the battle scenes is astoundingly well done and realistic from union general john buford s first encounter with rebel infantry to colonel chamberlain s courageous stand atop little round top to the massive climactic heavy with emotion pickett s charge each battle tells its own story develops characters and flows with energy and heroism n nthe soundtrack to the movie is a glorious musical accomplishment composed by randy edelman its combination of epic battle themes and classical civil war era music not only conveys the feel and emotion of the film perfectly but also stands alone as the best soundtrack ever composed for a war movie n nwith its spectacular cast wonderful script glorious soundtrack epic battle sequences constant devotion to historical accuracy and more gettysburg delivers an unrepeatable awe inspiring portrayal of the courageous men of the union and the confederacy who fought in the civil war
9;20;15;0.8261088312084814;as a child of the 1990s i first encountered gettysburg during one of its myriad screenings on the tnt cable network i immediately connected with the film a connection which has germinated into if not obsession certainly a keen interest in this period in our nation s history slavery independence invasion politics economics brother against brother all ingredients for a potent and portentous conflict and especially for great drama i ve also read michael shaara s great pulitzer prize winning novel nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href the killer angels dp 034540727x ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf8 the killer angels a nbsp from which this film was adapted and it is certainly worth your time and makes an excellent companion to the film n nthe film s strengths are its focus length and authenticity by concentrating on a single conflict the pivotal battle at gettysburg author shaara and filmmaker maxwell are able to delve into the psyche of their three leads confederate generals lee and longstreet and union colonel chamberlain and paint an impression for the audience as to how and why these men were locked in such a long and bloody struggle the level of character development is almost unheard of for a war epic and a leisurely yet assured pace holds the viewer s attention for the duration of the film which is n t the case with this film s companion prequel gods and generals n nas for this blu ray i m very pleased the 271 minute extended cut of the film and commentary track is presented on the first blu ray disc while the documentaries battlemaps and trailer from the dvd release are housed on a second disc also a dvd and thus in standard definition the digibook packaging is very attractive with vivid colors and the film s title is embossed it s really quite striking the 40 page booklet inside features cast and crew bios as well as some commentary on the film and battle along with a civil war timeline it s an excellent package n nthe video presentation while not reference quality is quite good colors and fine detail are greatly improved over the dvd there is significant film grain throughout and having never had the good fortune to view this in a theater for the first time i really felt that the movie looked like a film watching this blu ray you will wonder how you put up with that smeared dvd for so long audio is much the same presented here in 5 1 dts hd master audio finally with a dedicated lfe channel for your subwoofer so that cannonfire gunshots and randy edelman s stirring score all have far more oomph over previous incarnations n nall in all if you own the dvd this blu ray makes for an excellent and worthwhile upgrade if you re new to the film this is currently the best way to experience it very highly recommended
10;45;6;0.823588664149821;i saw gettysburg for first time about 8 years ago on a rental dvd bought it and have watched it several times since then i would say gettysburg and casablanca and high noon are my 3 favorite movies i love history and love to read about the civil war i particularly have enjoyed reading several books on ulysses grant amazing figure to come from working in his father s tanning shop to becoming such a great general that lincoln would say i have a general after the ones before had been rather duds i was pretty much blown away by this movie jeff daniels blew me away from near the start when he talks to the mutineers the movie had me the parts i was most moved by and just stunned by were when richard jordan gen armistead talks to tom berenger gen longstreet about the possibility that he may face in some battle his good friend from those days in california just before war broke out union general hancock longstreet tells him hancock is here at gettysburg unbelievable acting by jordan just stunning and so sad he knows he will probably die and gives longstreet some papers to give to hancock s wife in case he armistead dies then jeff daniels as col joshua chamberlain should have been given the oscar was he even nominated his battle of the little round top is my next favorite part of the movie probably close to 30 minutes long as another reviewer points out here on 4 10 2000 a very good civil war movie historians view this small unit action by the part of the 20th maine to be one of the defining moments of history i would think they probably mean world history as i guess historians feel if little round top was lost gettysburg would have been lost the south would have won the war and american history would be very different this great experiment in democracy failed jeff daniels is just stunning as he realizes there is nothing left to do if we stay here we ca n t fight they have run out of bullets and we leave they will run over us and the whole hill will be lost to paraphrase what he said and thus the battle will be lost the war will be lost and the country will be lost so the only thing they can do is to take the desperate measure of drawing their sabers and charging it is just stunning to see the faces of his men as he is telling them this his major ellis spears asking you mean charge and the men are stunned but chamberlain says well we ll have the advantage as we are going downhill i just feel the whole little round top 30 minute sequence is some of the best movie making ever the music jeff s talking to his men the camera work and the music as he moves up and down his line of men when he yells bayonets he looks absolutely crazed i love that either the director or jeff felt he should look crazed as he yells at the top of his lungs so all can hear him i mean it is almost ludicrous how crazy he looks his eyes bulge out when he yells bayonets but i think it was neat that he did this he is trying to yell as loud as he can and at this point who would n t be crazed you may die in a few seconds your brother may die and your dear friends and fellow soldiers may die and when major ellis yells charge and then chamberlain yells charge and down the hill they go into history well unbelievable movie making and gorgeous music the last part i love but no one here i think has commented about is the absolutely poignant 2 scenes with gen longstreet berenger and his artillery commander the 28 year old col porter alexander played by the english american actor james patrick stuart who i see is in the tv show supernatural which i have never watched but am going to to see his movie and tv credits just google him the first scene longstreet is talking to alexander about making sure he fires enough artillery to clear the union cannons off cemetary ridge before pickett can move and then a short while later the 2nd scene is utterly poignant alexander tells him that they had to move the remaining ammunition further to the rear so union cannons would n t destroy it and longstreet is frustrated as there are still too many union cannons firing their conversation you might not get the first time i did n t because they are practically yelling at each other to be heard it is noisy but then watching it again i listened better and understood better what they were saying longstreet ends by telling him paraphrasing just keep firing we have got to clear those cannons off that ridge they salute each other and alexander kind of lets his hand fall from his salute in a hesitant defeated way as longstreet turns and leaves and alexander then takes off his hat in the most dejected sad and poignant manner you can imagine as he does this and turns and pauses with his hat on his chest for a second it looks like a painting young 28 year old col alexander is so handsome with his dark hair and beard and mustache in his beautiful artillery commander long coat gray uniform with red accents i was just blown away by this what acting i have the 2000 issued dvd and the 2 scenes with longstreet and porter are on side b yes the 4 hour plus dvd has 2 sides and these longstreet porter scenes are scene 10 and the end of scene 16 this is the sad poignant one the little round top segment is on side a and runs from scene 28 scene 35 just want to say also as someone else mentioned here that 60 s tv actor andrew prine is wonderful so good as confederate gen garnett practically zombie like but i thought totally believable as he is about to take part in picketts charge and the way he acts and what he says it is like this is the day it is inevitable that this could be the day he will die i thought of all the generals north or south he was the best of the actors who played the generals even though his was a very small part he and stephen lang as pickett and of course jeff daniels as chamberlain also very good as chamberlain s younger brother tom is c thomas howell so good looking and earnest too bad thomas howell has n t had a more prominent career as an actor he was wonderful and the ending of the movie is so poignant yes i use this word a lot but it seems appropriate for this movie about one of the most tragic periods in american history at the very end as the smoke from the battle is still in the air in a beautiful sunset on the last day of the gettysburg battle lawrence and tom find each other and look at each other in absolute sadness but also utter disbelief that they have both survived this battle and then just embrace for a long time and then look again at each other again and then tom s shoulders just go down just as the beautiful music just goes goes downward in a beat just so touching and sad i am just a crazed older woman who loves reading reading about history and momentous events and i just love this movie can you tell please see it history buffs and tell us what you think
11;23;2;0.8005007729681767;darn i though i wrote a review for this movie long ago but this is by far the best movie about the civil war i ve ever seen probably because my avocation is the history of modern warfare and ted turner who worked like hell to get the us government and national park service to let them film this masterpiece on the actual gettysburg national cemetery but while tom berringer was great the guy who i never expected to play robert edward lee as the confederate commander was by a performance turned in by martin sheen who played the part of lee as both brilliant and lucky at least until the battle starts getting underway when you know lee s stubbornness has led him to realize as gen george pickett makes his famous charge across almost two miles of open land rising up to seminary ridge where the union had superiority on the high ground and finally the rebs had lost so many men lee knew he had lost the most decisive battle of the war and with it the csa so i say this if you ve never been a fan of war movies remember this is your history and if lincoln had n t kept sending one telegram after another looking for that go to general and when it was all over lincoln scolded gen meade for letting lee s army escape across the pontomac back to southern territory if meade had done what president lincoln who was so desperate to end the war wanted he would have charged down from his high ground and killed as many of lee s men even the wounded as possible taken the souths artillery and finally taken gen lee and his senior generals as prisoner which would have ended the war july 5 1863 the last day of the battle and picketts charge were on july 4 1863
12;19;8;0.7813967807680042;i became a fan of jeff daniels after his depiction of chamberlain of the maine 20th on little round top those were the strongest scenes and they better be but the rest i fast forwarded through an hour and a half of speeches who could write this stuff or believe that tough as nails soldiers from that era would even speak such sentimental drivel it comes down to a poorly written screenplay focused way too much on myth instead of insight you end up with a movie that tells instead of shows cinema is always better to paraphrase a steve mcqueen adage when actors use their their facial muscles more than their vocal cords actors know what to do with proper lines the raw material was there but the mine was never dug maybe the scale was too large for the crucial details to emerge but if you re going to take on gettysburg you better bring it ni appreciate the volunteers efforts but many fill out their uniforms a bit much an impossibility for the rebels after two years in the field fighting and evading the union army those guys should have been rangy sons of guns a volunteer cast of thousands explains but does not excuse at least some confederates are shown marching shoeless nanother detail when gettysburg s cannons fire they do n t recoil backward i noticed in gods and generals that the same director got around to correcting this if there s no recoil rifles included then you re obviously firing blanks a point i realize that s not appreciated by many at least not consciously if you re trying to create an impression of shooting to kill then fool us into believing that something s coming out the barrel especially with big guns ni have come to the conclusion that the predominantly positive reviews of the film reflect the political split in this country many people prefer idealized and insulting to the men who died depictions maintaining an iconography of american history instead of gritty portrayals of flawed humans that inspire and vicariously inform and when i say inform i do n t mean through declarations and cueing string music
13;21;5;0.703913095055255;this is a case study for making a war film boring the dialogue is wooden and the battle scenes look like civil war buffs doing reenactments people praise the film for not being too graphic but the reality of war looks and sounds much more like the first half hour of saving private ryan than the sanitized battlefield scenes in this film it would be better to show people the reality of the civil war which was horrific by all means read killer angels which provides a glimpse of what the actual battle was like
14;9;3;0.5492586983143251;i really love this movie it s one of my favorite civil war movies martin sheen and tom berenger portrays a great general lee and general longstreet and the rest of the actors and reinactors were also great

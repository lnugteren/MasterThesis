treat presented in 1080p 1 78 1 disney pixar raised the bar of their own previous works and managed to capture so much detail in this film literally i was floored by how incredible this film looks from the moment i saw the cg skin of carl the detail of the clothing of leather the detail inside the home of carl and ellie the detail on the plants the rocks the sky you name it up is an incredible looking film on high definition but an animated film in which the famous animation studio has raised the bar yet again n nby watching how the creative arts group at pixar actually went up high into the tepui mountains saw all the rock formations for themselves a chance to embrace draw and see how things are in the area but also see how paradise falls looks in reality definitely gave the crew a major incentive to make sure the atmosphere of up was just as detailed as they saw with their own eyes from the flowers the plants the unusual rock formations the sky and weather conditions the animation crew was able to capture it so closely with again so much detail i was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looks n nthere are also details in the way russell wears his clothes and the clothing movement the hair of the dogs and how the lighting effects reflect from the hair off the dogs the slobber of the dogs just the way the physics are with the balloons as it carries the house and more there is just a lot of well thought out details that come along with the film and you just ca n t help but be impressed n npicture quality is absolutely fantastic walt disney studios have pretty much been leaders in quality for their animated releases on blu ray and the colors are vibrant blacks are nice and dark but again the sheer amount of detail is just incredible no compression no banding if there was a film that i can easily classify as reference quality up is definitely a film i would put high up there n nas for audio quality the film is presented in english 5 1 and 2 0 dts hd and also french and spanish 5 1 dolby the film also sounds incredible from the dogs barking all around you the sound of the weather around south america the balloons popping and the action sequences at the end of the film sound is crystal clear from the front and center channels the film also sports solid surrounds capturing the overall ambiance and rear surrounds and also good amount of lfe usage especially during the storm sequences and when the house is bumping around the rocks n nthis is definitely a film that sounds incredible on blu ray and the lossless audio is definitely crystal clear and immersive overall this is a soundtrack that has its immersive moments but what captures your attention and what sets the mood is the beautiful soundtrack by composer michael giacchino the beautiful music that captures that feel of yesteryear is just amazing n nas for subtitles subtitles are in english sdh french and spanish n nthe dvd features video in widescreen

2 1 48 theatrical trailer 3 2 29 n ndvd n nthe dvd contains the same special features as the blu ray disc one n njudgment call n ni absolutely love up and i think that aside from the great detail and animation what i enjoyed is how it communicates to adults as carl and ellie are absolutely relatable to the adults and married couples and you can understand the pain that he goes through when you lose that special someone in your life the film does a great job of balancing his story his emotions of trying to keep ellie s memory alive through his home while russell represents that innocent and naive child and seeing these two characters total opposites together and trying to make things work n nbut what i found touching is that initial first 10 15 minutes of the film and seeing carl and ellie grow and the pain they have encountered in their life the inability to have a child to see their dreams dashed by situations that required the money they saved up for their trip but the pain of seeing how these two have grown from children to seniors one thing that the pixar crew wanted to accomplish with this film is to capture that appreciation you have for your grandparents but also an animated film that young children can enjoy through the character of russell n nthere are some deep things that happen in the film circumstances that children probably will not understand but for adults these emotions that touch you profoundly of course a lot of these deep emotions are for the first 15 minutes of the film between carl and ellie as we see flashbacks through their married years but the film becomes highly entertaining once we see the child russell and the old man carl together and having to work together despite carl getting a bit annoyed by russell s youth and non stop talking and moving n nbut it s the pacing set by the screenwriters that work the film never gets boring as it the film becomes very adventurous and also humorous throughout the humor of a house traveling throughout parts of the world on hundreds of balloons is just a fun concept and again the film never gets boring it s just an exciting and fun ride when both carl and russell are together and manages to end with an uplifting ending n nand the fun does n t stop there this blu ray release is packed four discs with special features that really go into how this film was created and learning about the things that inspired the filmmakers but also the trip the pixar crew took to the mountains that inspired them to create that atmosphere that was great to see but also there are fun shorts for the children as well and also a game and of course a dvd for those long commutes and a digital copy as well n nas for the pg rating this is the second pixar animated film to get the rating since the incredibles and mainly its because of the action sequences those sequences are not scary at all and i watched the film with my six year old if anything he was asking questions which related to carl and ellie s marriage parts which relate to a scene in which carl and ellie are unable to have children and the scene where carl is mourning after ellie s passing n n up is a film that was geared not just for children but for adults the film is mature enough for adults to appreciate enjoy and to be ultimately touched but also lively fun and exciting for children to enjoy definitely one of the top films of 2009 and one of the top blu ray releases of the year thus far overall up is absolutely magnificent and this blu ray release is highly recommended
1;55;28;0.9048640054037695;the marketing portrays up as a lighthearted comedy adventure it is n t while there are certainly funny moments on the whole it s the most depressing movie i ve seen in years and the contrast between the expectation and the reality is shocking i love dark movies but the way up is presented borders on deceptive i almost wonder if this film was intended as a psychological experiment n ni saw up in the theater seated in the row in front of me was a family of ogres who d spent the day stomping an orphanage flat they d brought a box of kittens to snack on during the movie within 10 minutes of the start of the film every one of them was bawling uncontrollably i m a stone cold heartless monster myself and never cry in movies until up hey pixar here s a tip tears ruin the 3d effect n npresumably the intention was use the death of the old man s wife as a starting point for an ultimately uplifting no pun intended story unfortunately it casts such a dark shadow on the rest of the movie that the funny bits do n t even begin to make up for it dug the dog is the brightest aspect of the movie and a hilarious character but does n t balance out the cascade of tragedies great and small that befall the old man seeing the old man tied to his house like a pack animal and being forced to drag it through the jungle is one of the lighter moments wth the happy ending really rings hollow and is n t worth the journey it takes to get there n ni considered not mentioning this next point but i m going to go ahead and do so anyway my mother in law died a few months before up came out and my father in law was as one would expect devastated my wife and i both separately came to the conclusion that if he d seen the movie he absolutely would have gone home and eaten his shotgun afterward i know that i used hyperbole earlier in this review but on this point i m being completely serious and not exaggerating n nfrom a technical standpoint up is superb the animation character design vocal performances etc are all top notch just as you would expect from pixar however i would only recommend it to emotional cripples psychopaths and people who have never experienced the loss of a loved one
2;43;11;0.8978893460424595;well everybody has to jump the shark sometime right the a team had stockwell mash had alan alda as a director firefly had the entire fourth disc the last four episodes have their moments but let s be honest they re not anywhere near as well written as the episodes on the previous discs the bounty hunter and the brothel villains were so 2 dimensional you could use them to split atoms and not initiate a nuclear event n nand pixar has up warning the following will contain spoilers n nsavvy credit watchers will note that up does not boast the involvement of john lasseter at all and andrew stanton or brad bird except in the role of executive producers executive producer is a hollywood term that means i ll give you some money and take the credit for your success but i m not doing any work n nthis is understandable lasseter stanton and bird have been practically living in the studio since toy story they have families and they ve made a pile of money i do n t blame them one bit for wanting to spend more time with their kids unfortunately like jim henson s death they took all the magic with them and what remained was only someone trying desperately to imitate what was uniquely inimitable n nlike all pixar movies up is technically impressive the visuals are stunning in some places and the animation is exquisite whoever researched the dogs earned his money unlike pixar movies however the writing leans too heavily on sight gags and shies away from character exploration almost entirely it s like a dreamworks movie got lost and pixar kidnapped it hey yoh n nthere are a lot of things wrong with the movie but i think the fundamental problem is the lack of empathy every other pixar movie has been the manifestation of some passion or affection that men like john lasseter andrew stanton or brad bird had for something toys and finding nemo were about their kids cars was about their parents ratatouille was about their own passion for creation no matter what the movie either bird or stanton or both were speaking through the main characters it s why the movies were so good why the characters rang so true they were honest n nthe creative heads behind up not only fail to empathize with the main character they do n t even seem to like him at all let s have a look at what happens to the main character through the course of the movie n n1 he meets the love of his life in a decrepit run down old house and falls through the ceiling and breaks his arm they later buy the house and fix it up as a married couple n2 he marries the love of his life and they attempt to have children but an apparent miscarriage leaves her barren i say apparent because that scene is part of a musical montage of their relationship that takes up about 10 minutes of the first reel n3 during the musical montage they decide to follow their childhood dreams by setting up a savings jar to go exploring but on three occasions they have to use the money in the savings jar to pay for emergencies n4 during the musical montage the main character buys plane tickets to the amazon so they can fulfill their dreams of being explorers in their retirement n5 but before he can present the tickets to her she has a heart attack and dies during the musical montage n6 the neighborhood around the house he and his wife rebuilt from the ground has gone commercial surrounded by glass and steel monoliths he is the last holdout and wo n t sell to the developer n7 a construction worker backs over his mailbox which he and his wife hand painted during the musical montage and though well meaning wo n t let the old man repair it himself n8 the old man gets evicted from his house after hitting the construction worker who would n t let him have his mailbox over the head with his cane n9 the old man flies his house to the amazon following the footsteps of the childhood hero he and his wife shared and the reason why they wanted to explore the amazon in the first place n10 only it turns out that his childhood hero is a homicidal lunatic who sets his house on fire and subsequently tries to kill him nso in the course of the movie he loses his wife his house and his childhood hero but it s all okay because he helped a small annoying kid rescue a large annoying bird n nfurthermore nobody in the movie listens to the main character or seems to care about him at all the land developers wo n t listen to him the guys from the old folk s home wo n t listen to him the annoying kid that accidentally tagged along on the trip to the amazon wo n t listen to him his childhood hero wo n t listen to him the talking dog who is the lone bright spot in the movie wo n t listen to him the only person in the movie who gave a rat s rear end what the main character thought about anything was killed off in the first ten minutes n nhis character is n t even well written when we initially meet him he s shy almost timid under his wife s influence he s happy but after her death he turns into cranky old coot stereotype number 7 asner variant sure his house is surrounded by skyscrapers and construction workers but his transformation from mousey balloon vendor to crusty old fart is so sudden that i ca n t help but wonder if the only contact the writers had with old people came from watching abe vigoda and wolford brimley movies memo to pixar not every old person living alone is perpetually cranky n nand he s not the only character who s taken directly from the saturday morning tv school of character stereotypes the other primary character is a chubby boy scout who is seeking his helping the elderly merit badge he s your standard annoying wise beyond his years preadolescent whose innocence will show the old man the error of his ways at one point the kid is talking about his estranged father aww he lacks a father figure and look the main character lacks a son i wonder where this is going he remarks that what he really remembers is the little boring everyday stuff that he did get to do not the big important stuff that he did n t that thud you hear is the message being delivered like a sack of tainted meat into a dumpster pardon me while i gag myself with a screwdriver n nthe villains are n t particularly fleshed out either the land developer has no dialog and exists primarily as a man with a cell phone who stands in for corporate soullessness lessness lessness lessness i wo n t harp on him because he s not really supposed to be a fleshed out villain though i will point out that pixar has done the corporate villain so much better in both monster s inc and the incredibles n nthe other villain which you could see coming from the start of the movie if you pay close enough attention is the main character s childhood hero a celebrated explorer he is disgraced when scientists dispute his findings of a seven foot tall bird that roams the remotest regions of the amazon rainforest he sets out for the rainforest vowing to return only when he has positive proof that he s not a liar when we find him next he is not merely bitter at his mistreatment at the hands of the press but downright bat guano insane it is strongly intimated that he murdered any explorer archaeologist botanist who he ever encountered in the rainforest because he suspected them of trying to capture his bird and steal his glory n nthe main problem with the villain is that the writers think that bat guano insane is a substitute for personality every other villain in a pixar movie has had human motivations and has been sympathetic to some degree even the aussie dentist in finding nemo was more clueless than evil this guy is just completely inhuman and not in the i believe what i was programmed to believe way that the wheel was in wall e he s just one dimensional it s like someone said oh let s just make him a hunter who kills people that s good enough right and everyone just nodded n nthe one character or group of characters that are well written and fully realized are the dogs the villain has an enormous pack of dogs at his command and he has outfitted them with collars that translate their thoughts into english this opens up the inevitable i would like that ball and squirrel jokes that actually work they re the only thing in the movie that does n ni d be more willing to forgive the cardboard characters if the rest of the movie was n t taken whole cloth from the clich factory as well the whole denouement is so laughably derivative i would accuse it of being brilliant parody if they were n t taking themselves so seriously the villain sets the main character s house on fire as a distraction because the main character is defending the large bird seeing his whole life go up in flames the old man rushes to extinguish the flames leaving the villain open to waltz off with the bird how the main character was supposed to stop the villain who at the time was flanked by his army of vicious dogs and carrying a rifle that acts like a shotgun is n t discussed but the annoying kid is very disappointed at the main character for just letting the bird go n nafter the kid yells at the old man for acting like a human being instead of some paragon of selfless giving 1 the old man reverts to full on grouch mode and takes his house to finish what he set out to do in the first place and he does it by jiminy the house sets down right where he and his wife planned to build their retirement home n nbut it s all hollow we know this because as he puts the furniture back where it belongs and rehangs the pictures on the walls the score plays sad music and the color scheme is just slightly muted even the photograph of his wife seems to look down on him in disappointment all that was missing was him looking at a mirror with a melancholy expression only to turn away in disgust at what he had become and quite frankly i m not altogether certain he did n t by this point in the movie my eyes were rolling so much i m sure i missed some things n nwhen the kid shows up and steals some balloons so he can chase after the bird himself the main character finally gets it he expunges the house of everything inside so the withering balloons could lift what remained skyward once more the last we see of the furniture as the house flies away is his chair sitting neatly next to his wife s chair on the ground as the triumphal music swells and eggs the old man onward and upward yeah you dump that old crappy symbol of the life you had with your wife forget her it s time to go save some kid you do n t know and a bird you do n t like he chases after the villain who has captured the annoying child and left him tied to a chair and ready to drop from the loading dock of his blimp to the ground so many thousands of feet below the villain and the main character have a climactic battle that employs a clumsy version of the i threw my back out joke that was so much better in the incredibles see it s funny because they re both so old also old people smell like prunes n nseriously that s how the dogs find him as he sneaks aboard the villain s airship they smell prunes they could n t even spare the cash for some additional syllables and use the word liniment n nneedless to say the kid is rescued the villain was dispatched through the use of a high fall the likes of which i have n t seen since i watched every movie that ever came out between 1985 and 1999 n nfinally we re treated to a scene where the annoying kids finally gets his helping the elderly merit badge with the main character standing by his side because the kid s father could n t be there all together now awwww and then they go share ice cream and count different color cars just like the kid used to do with his dad and again awwwwww and apparently the court order remanding the old man to a home has been rescinded or at least it s unenforceable because he now lives in the villain s airship n noh and just to throw a bone to those of us who understood why it was important to the main character to keep a promise he made to his wife so many years ago the last we see of the house it just happened to land right where he wanted to put it what a coincidence n ni suppose up was an accurate enough title for the movie given the infatuation with flight but if they wanted to make it more accurate and a whole lot more descriptive they would have called it trite n nthat s not something i ever thought i d be able to say about a pixar movie usually they come right up to the edge of being trite without actually falling off the precipice this one just points the car at the edge of the cliff and lays down rubber n ni have more complaints like about how this movie is a violent departure from pixar s classical themes about how nostalgia is a good and fundamentally human emotion and the fact that it s not only okay but admirable that people have attachments to physical objects heck if the people who made up had done cars the residents of radiator springs would just pack up and move to california because it s just a road right move on n nbut i m running long so i wo n t in conclusion i just want to say that i will no longer buy a pixar movie on dvd just because pixar did it it was my last vestige of fanboy mentality and up snuffed it out i do n t know whether i should be angry or grateful
3;52;23;0.8475200971219802;it s not a good thing when the cast outside of the leads outshine and overtake the main event the two leads are like listening to chalk on a blackboard for two obnoxious hours the old codger is the cranky fuddy duddy you would shy from checking the mail if he was in the front yard next to yours i do n t want to hear it the wilderness explorer kid is a slap in the face contrivance to the boy scouts of america that they are a herd of cutsie wootsie beings trying to be a flame of gosh golly gee goodness wrong boy scouts are a serious bunch of explorers that surround themselves in fun with what they are doing learning to be a better american and not a bothersome kid the dogs should have taken over production as the short animation extra special mission proves they were more adorable original and could hold their own turf away from the dreary humans even the extra partly cloudy was a milestone in comparison to the main feature i mean what is with these features the artists conjure up some finally drawn character give them some rather cliche typecast traits and expect the audience to fall in love like when the old man tearfully browsed through an old photo album with emotional piano score i was thinking the audience never got to know his sweetheart other than the goofy intro to the movie i fastforwrded that part on the dvd thank goodness it was giving me the creeps
4;25;87;0.8367838351413254;this review is not for the movie itself but for the price of this blu ray over 41 dollars are they insane no movie should cost more than 20 and with so many dvd s these days being bargain priced at 10 this film is way overpriced as if the company is ashamed to ask for so much they ve even included a label that reads a 74 dollar value really how is that possible when all i want is the movie i could care less for the 3d glasses or the extra special features or the on line bonus material or the digicopy disc does anybody really care about all that stuff does n t 90 of the population just want the movie and maybe a decent documentary to go with it does pixar really think so little of its fans that it thinks it can pull the wool over our heads like this n ni had planned on completing my pixar collection on blu ray since the transfers look fantastic but now i have to reconsider we are currently in a recession and i do n t have the extra money for this of course this begs the question why why does pixar have to charge so much extra for their movies surely a popular title like up will be mass produced to sell a bazillion copies therefore allowing for more economic pricing could it be that the greed that sank the disney corp after the lion king topped the box office has now affected pixar has pixar succumb to its own success i prayed the day would n t come i was a huge disney fan to the point of near religious devotion before the company sold their heart and soul cinderella 2 anyone for a cheap buck please john lasseter give us reasonable pricing and try to remember what made your company special in the first place caring more about the art and less about the money does money have to corrupt everything do n t make the same mistake as disney
5;27;8;0.7353351701722541;since catching the frozen bug i ve been looking for another animated feature that is as compelling for my money most honestly are n t but this one is jaded as i am i get through most dramas without crying and most comedies without laughing out loud this film made me do both n nthe storyline is quite unorthodox it starts with the happily ever after the montage depicting carl and ellie s happy married years is absolutely astounding ironically given the film s title it s very down to earth it s some of the most masterful and touching motion picture work i ve ever witnessed animated or live action n nthe adventure segment kicks in at the absolute least likely of junctures the morning a cantankerous old carl is scheduled to get trucked off to assisted living the premise rigging his house with thousands of balloons to turn it into an airship is comically absurd perfect for an animated fantasy n ni m not much for dogs in real life but here they really cracked me up especially all the dogs playing poker references the golden retriever dug is easily the most funny and least annoying of all comic relief sidekicks n noverall this is one of the most brilliant and original things i ve ever seen
6;40;7;0.721925285500682;possibly pixar s greatest masterpiece the first 10 15 minutes are unequaled in animated cinema powerful emotional the simple story of a couples life laid out with almost no dialog not a dry eye in the house the rest of the story is just a fun and joyous romp of memorable characters there are so mainly complex themes involving life and living and aging that you could write a careers worth of college papers on it but at the end of the day it is just wonderful the movie that gave cone of shame to the pop culture lexicon
